From 1943 onwards he was activeas a poet, and published four volumes of verse between 1946 and 1953. Meanwhilethe group of painters and poets already mentioned had been fo rmed (Dau al Set),and Cirlot became its leading theoretician. For historical or political reasons,Spain had been slow to develop a contemporary movement in the arts comparableto those in other European countries; its greatest artists, Picasso and Miró, hadidentified themselves with the School of Paris. But now a vigorous and independent‘School of Barcelona’ was to emerge, with Antonio Tapies and Modesto Cuixartas its outstanding representatives. In a series of books and brochures Cirlot notonly presented the individual artists of this group, but also instructed the Spanishpublic in the history and theoretical foundations of the modern movement as awhole.In the course of this critical activity Señor Cirlot inevitably became aware ofthe ‘symbolist ethos’ of modern art. A symbolic element is present in all art, in sofar as art is subject to psychological interpretation. But in so far as art has evolvedin our time away from the representation of an objective reality towards theexpression of subjective states of feeling, to that extent it has become a whollysymbolic art, and it was perhaps the necessity for a clarification of this functionin art which led Señor Cirlot to his profound study of symbolism in all itsaspects.The result is a volume which can either be used as a work of reference, orsimply read for pleasure and instruction. There are many entries in this dictionary—those on Architecture, Colour, Cross, Graphics, Mandala, Numbers, Serpent,Water, Zodiac, to give a few examples—which can be read as independent essays."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"FOREWORDxBut in general the greatest use of the volume will be for the elucidation of thosemany symbols which we encounter in the arts and in the history of ideas. Man,it has been said, is a symbolizing animal; it is evident that at no stage in thedevelopment of civilization has man been able to dispense with symbols. Scienceand technology have not freed man from his dependence on symbols: indeed, itmight be argued that they have increased his need for them. In any case, symbologyitself is now a science, and this volume is a necessary instrument in its study.HERBERT READ"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Delimitation of the Symbolic On entering the realms of symbolism, whether byway of systematized artistic forms or the living, dynamic forms of dreams andvisions, we have constantly kept in mind the essential need to mark out the fieldof symbolic action, in order to prevent confusion between phenomena whichmight appear to be identical when they are merely similar or externally related.The temptation to over-substantiate an argument is one which is difficult toresist. It is necessary to be on one’s guard against this danger, even if full compli-ance with the ideals of scholarship is not always feasible; for we believe withMarius Schneider that there is no such thing as ‘ideas or beliefs’, only ‘ideas andbeliefs’, that is to say that in the one there is always at least something of theother—quite apart from the fact that, as far as symbolism is concerned, otherphenomena of a spiritual kind play an important part.When a critic such as Caro Baroja (10) declares himself against any symbolicinterpretation of myth, he doubtless has his reasons for so doing, although onereason may be that nothing approaching a complete evaluation of symbolism hasyet appeared. He says: ‘When they seek to convince us that Mars is the symbolof War, and Hercules of Strength, we can roundly refute them. All this may oncehave been true for rhetoricians, for idealist philosophers or for a group of more orless pedantic graeculi. But, for those who really believed in ancient deities andheroes, Mars had an objective reality, even if this reality was quite different fromthat which we are groping for today. Symbolism occurs when natural religions aredegenerating.’ In point of fact, the mere equation of Mars with War and of Her-cules with Labour has never been characteristic of the symbolist ethos, whichalways eschews the categorical and restrictive. This comes about through alle-gory, a mechanical and restricting derivative of the symbol, whereas the symbolproper is a dynamic and polysymbolic reality, imbued with emotive and concep-tual values: in other words, with true life.ACTUALITY OF THE SYMBOLINTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ACTUALITY OF THE SYMBOLxiiHowever, the above quotation is extremely helpful in enabling us to mark outthe limits of the symbolic. If there is or if there may be a symbolic function ineverything, a ‘communicating tension’, nevertheless this fleeting possession ofthe being or the object by the symbolic does not wholly transform it into asymbol. The error of symbolist artists and writers has always been preciselythis: that they sought to turn the entire sphere of reality into a vehicle for impal-pable ‘correspondences’, into an obsessive conjunction of analogies, withoutbeing aware that the symbolic is opposed to the existential and instrumental andwithout realizing that the laws of symbolism hold good only within its ownparticular sphere. This distinction is one which we would also apply to thePythagorean thesis that ‘everything is disposed according to numbers’, as well asto microbiological theory. Neither the assertion of the Greek philosopher on theone hand, nor the vital pullulation subjected invisibly to the science of Weightsand Measures on the other, is false; but all life and all reality cannot be forced toconform with either one theory or the other, simply because of its certitude, forit is certain only within the limits of theory. In the same way, the symbolic is trueand active on one plane of reality, but it is almost unthinkable to apply it system-atically and consistently on the plane of existence. The consequent scepticismconcerning this plane of reality—the magnetic life-source of symbols and theirconcomitants—explains the widespread reluctance to admit symbolical values;but such an attitude is lacking in any scientific justification.Carl Gustav Jung, to whom present-day symbology owes so much, pointsout in defence of this branch of human thought that: ‘For the modern mind,analogies—even when they are analogies with the most unexpected symbolicmeanings—are nothing but self-evident absurdities. This worthy judgement doesnot, however, in any way alter the fact that such affinities of thought do exist andthat they have been playing an important rôle for centuries. Psychology has aduty to recognize these facts; it should leave it to the profane to denigrate them asabsurdities or as obscurantism’ (32). Elsewhere Jung observes that all the energyand interest devoted today by western Man to science and technology were, byancient Man, once dedicated to mythology (31). And not only his energy andinterest but also his speculative and theorizing propensities, creating the immea-surable wealth of Hindu, Chinese and Islamic philosophy, the Cabbala itself andthe painstaking investigations of alchemy and similar studies. The view that bothancient and oriental man possessed a technique of speculative thought whichassured them of some success in prophecy is affirmed by, for example, thearchaeologist and historian, Contenau, who maintains that the schools of sooth-sayers and magicians of Mesopotamia could not have continued to flourish with-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM AND HISTORICITYxiiiout a definite proportion of correct prognostications; and again by GastonBachelard (1), posing the question: ‘How could a legend be kept alive and per-petuated if each generation had not “intimate reasons” for believing in it?’ Thesymbolist meaning of a phenomenon helps to explain these ‘intimate reasons’,since it links the instrumental with the spiritual, the human with the cosmic, thecasual with the causal, disorder with order, and since it justifies a word likeuniverse which, without these wider implications, would be meaningless, a dis-membered and chaotic pluralism; and finally, because it always points to thetranscendental.To revert to the question of the limits of the symbolic and to fix more pre-cisely the aims of this work, let us consider how, on the façade of a monastery, forexample, we may note: (a) the beauty of the whole; (b) the constructional tech-nique; (c) its period-styling, bearing in mind the geographical and historical impli-cations; (d) the implicit or explicit cultural and religious values, etc.; and also (x)the symbolic meaning of the forms. In this instance, the appreciation of thesymbolical implications of an ogival arch beneath a rose window could constitutean item of knowledge different in kind from the other items we have enumerated.To facilitate analyses of this kind without, let us repeat, confusing the symbolicessence of an object—the transitory symbolic function which heightens it at anygiven moment—with its total significance as a real object in the world—that isour main aim. The fact that a Romanesque cloister corresponds exactly to theconcept of temenos (sacred precinct) and to the images of the soul, the fountainand the central fount—like sutratma (silver thread), linking a phenomenon byway of its centre to its origin—does not invalidate or even modify the architec-tural and utilitarian reality of this cloister; it enriches its significance by identify-ing it with an ‘inner form’.SYMBOLISM AND HISTORICITYOne of the most deplorable errors of symbolist theory, in its ‘spontaneous’ aswell as in its occult and even its dogmatic interpretations, lies in opposing thesymbolical to the historical. Arguing from the premise that there are symbols—and, indeed, there are many—which exist only within their own symbolic struc-ture, the false conclusion is then drawn that all or almost all transcendental eventswhich appear to be both historical and symbolic at once—in other words, to besignificant once and for all time—may be seen simply as symbolic matter trans-formed into legend and thence into history."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM AND HISTORICITYxivThe most authoritative students of religion, orientalists and even esotericscholars have recently raised their voices in protest against this error. MirceaEliade asserts that ‘the two points of view are only superficially irreconcilable .. ., for it must not be thought that a symbolic connotation annuls the material andspecific validity of an object or action. Symbolism adds a new value to an objector an act, without thereby violating its immediate or “historical” validity. Once itis brought to bear, it turns the object or action into an “open” event: symbolicthought opens the door on to immediate reality for us, but without weakening orinvalidating it; seen in this light the universe is no longer sealed off, nothing isisolated inside its own existence: everything is linked by a system of correspon-dences and assimilations. Man in early society became aware of himself in aworld wide open and rich in meaning. It remains to be seen whether these “open-ings” are just another means of escape or whether, on the other hand, they offerthe only possible way of accepting the true reality of the world’ (18).In this quotation we can see clearly formulated the distinction between thehistorical and the symbolic. We can also see the everpresent possibility of abridge linking both forms of reality in a cosmic synthesis. The hint of scepticismin the concluding words of this Rumanian scholar should be ascribed to hispredominantly scientific training at a time when science, with its emphasis uponthe analytical approach, has achieved admirable results in every sphere of realitywithout showing itself capable of grasping the overall organic pattern, that is: as‘multiplicity in unity’. This scientific disaffection has been well defined by Mar-tin Buber: Imago mundi nova, imago nulla. In other words, the world today lacksits own image, because this image can be formulated only by means of a universalsynthesis of knowledge—a synthesis which, since the Renaissance and the deomni re scibili of Pico della Mirandola, has daily become more difficult.In connexion with this question of the relationship between the historical andthe symbolic, René Guénon has observed: ‘There is indeed over-eager acceptanceof the belief that to allow a symbolic meaning must imply the rejection of theliteral or historical meaning; such a view shows an ignorance of the law of corre-spondences. This law is the foundation of all symbolism and by virtue of it everything proceeding essentially from a metaphysical principle, which is the source ofits reality, translates and expresses this principle in its own way and according toits own level of existence, so that all things are related and joined together in total,universal harmony which is, in its many guises, a reflection, as it were, of its ownfundamental unity . . . One result of this is the range of meaning contained in everysymbol: any one thing may, indeed, be regarded as an illustration not only ofmetaphysical principles but also of higher levels of reality’ (25)."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM AND HISTORICITYxvThe above considerations make it clear that the symbolic in no way excludesthe historical, since both forms may be seen—from the ideological point of view—as functional aspects of a third: the metaphysical principle, the platonic ‘idea’; orall three may be seen as reciprocal expressions of one meaning on different levels.Going to the kernel of the problem, religion—which naturally absorbs so much ofhis attention—Jung agrees with Eliade and Guénon in his belief that ‘the psychicfact “God” is a collective archetype, a psychic existent, which must not in itselfbe confused with the concept of a metaphysical God’. The existence of thearchetype (that is, of the symbol) ‘neither postulates a God, nor does it deny thathe exists’ (31); yet although this is, strictly speaking, unquestionable, it mustsurely be agreed—if only in theory—that the universality of an archetype af-firms rather than denies the reality of the principle in question. Consequently thesymbolic, being independent of the historical, not only does not exclude it but, onthe contrary, tends to root it firmly in reality, because of the parallelism betweenthe collective or individual world and the cosmic. And because of the great depthof the hidden roots of all systems of meanings, a further consequence is ourtendency to espouse the theory that all symbolist traditions, both western andoriental, spring from one common source. Whether this one source once appearedin time and space as a primeval focal point, or whether it stems from the ‘collec-tive unconscious’, is quite another matter.We should like to emphasize that when we refer, in the various passagesquoted and paraphrased, to ‘tradition’ or ‘traditional doctrine’, we are referringonly to the continuity—conscious or unconscious—and the coherence of a sys-tem, as much in the dimension of space as in that of time. Some writers favour thedoctrine of a spontaneous growth of historically unrelated ideas, while othersbelieve only in the spread of ideas through culture. Loeffler, for example, com-ments upon the importance of proving that the creation of the storm-myth be-longs neither to race nor tribe, since it occurred simultaneously in Asia, Europe,Oceania and America (38); this is akin to the contention of Rank that: ‘The mythis the collective dream of the people’, a concept substantiated by Rudolf Steiner.Bayley, following Max Müller, believes in the common origin of the human race,which he contends is proved by the universal themes of folklore, legend andsuperstition. Orientalism, the study of comparative religion, mythology, culturalanthropology, the history of civilization and art, esoterism, psychoanalysis, andsymbological research have all combined to provide us with ample material tosubstantiate ‘psychological truth’, and this ‘essential oneness’; further evidencehas been forthcoming from the psychic and also from physiological bases com-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND CONTINUITY OF THE SYMBOLxvimon to us all on account of the importance of the human body—its shape as wellas its postures—in relation to the simplest elements of symbolist dialectic.ORIGIN AND CONTINUITY OF THE SYMBOLThe Development of Symbolism Diel rightly asserts that the symbol is a vehicle atonce universal and particular. Universal, since it transcends history; particular,because it relates to a definite period of history. Without going into questions of‘origin’, we shall show that most writers agree in tracing the beginnings of sym-bolist thought to prehistoric times—to the latter part of the Palaeolithic Age. Ourpresent knowledge of primitive thought and the deductions which can justifiablybe drawn concerning the art and the belongings of early man substantiate thishypothesis, but substantiation has been forthcoming particularly from researchupon epigraphic engravings. The constellations, animals and plants, stones andthe countryside were the tutors of primitive man. It was St. Paul who formulatedthe basic notion of the immediate consequence of this contact with the visible,when he said: ‘Per visibilia ad invisibilia’ (Romans i, 20). The process wherebythe beings of this world are ordered according to their properties, so that thewords of action and of spiritual and moral facts may be explored by analogy, isone which can also be seen, with the dawning of history, in the transition of thepictograph into the ideograph, as well as in the origins of art.We could adduce an immense weight of testimony offered by human faith andwisdom proving that the invisible or spiritual order is analogous to the materialorder. We shall come back to this later when we define ‘analogy’. Let us recall thesaying of Plato, taken up later by the pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite: ‘What isperceptible to the senses is the reflection of what is intelligible to the mind’; andechoed in the Tabula Smaragdina: ‘What is below is like what is above; what isabove is like what is below’, and also in the remark of Goethe: ‘What is within isalso without.’ However it may be, symbolism is organized in its vast explanatoryand creative function as a system of highly complex relations, one in which thedominant factor is always a polarity, linking the physical and metaphysical worlds.What palaeolithic Man evolved out of this process is impossible to know exceptthrough indirect deductions. Our knowledge about the latter part of the NeolithicAge is considerably wider. Schneider and Berthelot both consider that this wasthe period (that is: possibly the fourth millenary before history) when manunderwent that great transformation which endowed him with the gifts of cre-ation and organization, qualities which distinguish him from the merely natural"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND CONTINUITY OF THE SYMBOLxviiworld. Berthelot, who has studied this process in the Near East, has given thename of ‘astrobiology’ to the religious and intellectual cultures of that epoch. Theevolution of Man up to this point in history must have passed through thefollowing stages: animism; totemism; and megalithic, lunar and solar cultures. Thesubsequent stages must have been: cosmic ritualism; polytheism; monotheism;and, finally, moral philosophy. Berthelot considers astrology, astronomy, arith-metic and alchemy of Chaldean origin, a contention which points conclusively toa single focal point in time and space.He defines the value and significance of astrobiology in the following terms:‘Between on the one hand the world-vision—in many other respects variable andcomplex—of primitive races, and the vision of modern science and Western Eu-rope on the other, an intermediary view has long held sway in Asia and theMediterranean. It is what may be termed “astrobiology” or the interplay ofastronomic law (the mathematical order) and vegetable and animal life (the bio-logical order). All things form at one and the same time an organic whole and aprecise order. The domestication of animals and the care of plants (agriculture)had become a reality long before history began, both in Chaldaea and in Egypt—that is, before 3,000 B.C. Agriculture ensures the regular production of preciselydetermined species of vegetable, and also ensures an appreciation of their annual“rhythm” of growth, flowering, fructifying, sowing and harvesting, a rhythmwhich is in direct and constant relation to the calendar, in other words, theposition of the heavenly bodies. Time and natural phenomena were measured byreference to the moon before they came to be measured by the sun . . . . Astrobi-ology hovers between a biology of the heavenly bodies and an astronomy ofhuman beings; beginning with the former, it tends towards the latter’ (7). Duringthe neolithic era the geometric idea of space was formulated; so also were thesignificance of the number seven (derived from this concept of space), the relationbetween heaven and earth, the cardinal points, and the relations between thevarious elements of the septenary (the planetary gods, the days of the week) andbetween those of the quaternary (the seasons, the colours, the cardinal points, theelements). Berthelot believes in the slow spread of these ideas, rather than in theirspontaneous and independent appearance. He points to their probable dissemi-nation through either the northern or southern areas of the Pacific, mentioning inpassing that America may well have been, in spirit, a colony of Asia before that ofEurope (7); and another stream may have been flowing in the opposite direction:from the Near East into Central Europe.The argument about whether European megalithic culture came before orafter the great oriental civilizations is far from settled. Here questions of symbol-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND CONTINUITY OF THE SYMBOLxviiiism arise. The importance of the Franco-Cantabrian zone in the Palaeolithic Ageis well known; it is also known that the art forms of this district spread acrossEurope in the direction of Siberia and southwards across North Africa to thesouthernmost part of the continent. There was, no doubt, a period of transitionbetween this early flowering and the great megalithic monuments. However thatmay be, Schneider specifically says in connexion with the symbolic forms stud-ied by him (50): ‘In the sixth chapter I shall try to summarize this esotericdoctrine, the systemization of which seems to have been originally the work ofmegalithic cultures.’ And his attitude towards the zone of origin leaves little roomfor doubt for he states that ‘the megalithic must have spread from Europe to Indiavia Danubian culture, a new stage of development beginning with the Age ofMetals’. He points out that there are marked similarities between the ideas ofregions as far apart as America, New Guinea, Indonesia, Western Europe, CentralAsia and the Far East, that is to say, of areas in all parts of the world.Let us consider now the similarity between the discoveries attributed bySchneider to megalithic European culture and those ascribed by Berthelot to theFar East. In Schneider’s opinion the final stage of neolithic development differedfrom the earlier stage ‘in the preference it showed for static and geometric forms,in its organizing and creative genius (evolving fabulous animals, musical instru-ments, mathematical proportions, number-ideas, astronomy and a tonal systemwith truly musical sounds). The carrying over of totemistic mystical elementsinto a more advanced, pastoral civilization explains some of the fundamentalcharacteristics of the new mystique. . . . The entire cosmos comes to be conceivedafter the human pattern. As the essence of all phenomena is, in the last resort, avibrant rhythm, the intimate nature of phenomena is directly perceptible bypolyrhythmic human consciousness. For this reason, imitating is knowing. Theecho is the paradigmatic form of imitation. Language, geometric symbols andnumber-ideas are a cruder form of imitation.’ Schneider then observes that accord-ing to Speiser and Heine-Geldern, ‘the outstanding cultural elements of megalithicculture are: cyclopean buildings, commemorative stones, stones as the dwelling-places of souls, cultural stone-circles, palafittes, head-hunting, the sacrifice ofoxen, eye-shaped ornaments, death-ships, family-trees, signal-drums, the sacrifi-cial stake, and labyrinths’ (50).It is precisely these elements that have most successfully preserved theirsymbolic form down the ages. And did not these express, even in megalithictimes, the very essence of human life, bursting from the unconscious in the shapeof a constructive and configurating longing? Or was it, rather, the ever-present,primary forms of life, sacrifice and intellection of the world which found everlast-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM IN THE WESTxixing expression in these cultural creations, making an ineradicable impression onthe mind of Man? One may unhesitatingly answer in the affirmative to bothquestions, for they refer to the different but parallel phenomena of culture andpsychology.SYMBOLISM IN THE WESTIt was Egypt who gave shape, in her religion and hieroglyphics, to Man’s aware-ness of the material and spiritual, natural and cultural duality of the world. Eitherindependently or together, the various civilizations of Mesopotamia developedtheir own particular systems; yet these systems were but outward variations ofthe one true, innermost, universal pattern. There are differences of opinion aboutdating the first appearance—or at any rate the final crystallization—of some ofthe most important and complex symbols. Some writers argue strongly in favourof remote origins. Krappe (35) holds that the scientific study of the planets andtheir identification with the gods of the Babylonian pantheon date only from the7th century B.C.; but others trace these beginnings as far back as the age ofHammurabi (2000 B.C.) or earlier. Father Heras, for example, says: ‘The earlyIndians, as has been revealed by inscriptions, were the discoverers of the move-ments of the sun across the sky—the basis of the zodiacal system. Their Zodiachad only eight constellations and each constellation was supposed to be a “formof God”. All these “forms of God” in the end became deities, each one presidingover one particular constellation; this is what happened in Rome, for example.The eight Indian signs of the Zodiac are: Edu (ram), Yal (harp), Nand (crab),Amma (mother), Tuk (balance), Kani (arrow), Kuda (pitcher), Min (fish).’ Thedodecatemorian system of the Zodiac first appears in the form in which we knowit as late as the 6th century B.C. Egyptian and Chaldean science was partlyassimilated by the Syrians, Phoenicians and Greeks, reaching the latter largelythrough secret societies. Herodotus points out, in writing of the Pythagoreans,that they were obliged to wear linen clothes ‘in accordance with the Orphicceremonies, which are the same as the Egyptian . . .’.The mythologies of the Mediterranean peoples were characterized by a vivid,dramatic vitality which came to be expressed both in their art and in their myths,legends and dramatic poetry. These myths enshrined the moral principles, thenatural laws, the great contrasts and the transformations which determine thecourse of cosmic and human life. Frazer points out that ‘under the names ofOsiris, Tammuz, Adonis and Attis, the peoples of Egypt and Western Asia rep-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM IN THE WESTxxresented the yearly decay and revival of life, especially of vegetable life’ (21). Thetasks of Hercules, the legend of Jason, the ‘histories’ of the heroic age of Greecewhich provided the inspiration for the classical tragedies, have such great arche-typal power that they constitute timeless lessons for mankind. But beneath thismythological and literary symbolism and allegory, a subterranean stream of orien-tal influence was beginning to flow in from the East.Principally during the Lower Roman Empire, when the cohesion of the clas-sical world was beginning to dissolve, Hebraic, Chaldean and Egyptian elementsbegan to ferment. Dualist Manichaeism and Gnosticism began to threaten theposition of early Christianity. Among the Gnostics, the emblem and the graphicsymbol were used for the propagation of initiatory truths. Many of the innumer-able images were not of their own creation but were compiled from varioussources, mainly Semitic. Symbolism veers towards the Unitarian doctrine ofreality and comes to be a specialized branch of speculation. Diodorus Siculus,Pliny, Tacitus, Plutarch, Apuleius all reveal some familiarity with oriental sym-bolism. Aristotelian thought also contained a strong element of symbolism. InSyria, Mesopotamia, Transcaucasia and Egypt, oriental Christianity had ab-sorbed a vast symbological inheritance. Similarly, those Roman colonies in theWest that survived the Nordic invasions retained many attributes of ancienttimes, including traditional symbols. But, according to the Rev. Fr. Festugière, inLa Révélation d’Hermès Trismégiste, one of the currents which were most able tocontribute to the formation of the symbolist and alchemic ‘corpus’ was that ofthe literature of the ‘Mirabilia’. This was apparently founded by Bolus theDemocritean during the 3rd-2nd centuries B.C. and was continued for centuries ina virtually unbroken tradition by Pseudo-Manetho, Nigidius Figulus, Demetrius,Apollodorus, etc., culminating in the Book of the Things of Nature, a Syrian workof the 7th century A.D.The concept of the analogy between the visible and the invisible world is,then, held jointly by the pagan religions of the Lower Empire, by neoplatonic andChristian doctrines, except that each one of these three systems uses this conceptfor its own ends. According to Eliade, Theophilus of Antioch would point out, tothose who denied the resurrection of the dead, the signs which God places inreach of Man in the realm of natural phenomena: the cycle of the seasons, of thedays and nights. He would even go further and say: ‘May there not perhaps beresurrection for the seeds and the fruits?’ (18). In his Letter number LV, St.Augustine shows that teaching carried out with the help of symbols feeds andstirs the fires of love, enabling Man to excel himself; he also alludes to the valueof all things in nature—organic and inorganic—as bearers of spiritual messages by"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM IN THE WESTxxiTitle-page of book of emblems by Joachim Camerario(Nuremberg, 1590) with symbolic tree, circleprecinct and grotesques"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM IN THE WESTxxiivirtue of their distinctive forms and characteristics. All the mediaeval lapidaries,herbals and bestiaries owe their origin to this concept. Most of the classicalFathers of the Church have something to say about symbolism and since theyenjoyed such a high reputation in Roman times, one can see why this was theperiod when the symbol came to be so deeply experienced, loved and understood,as Davy emphasizes (14). Pinedo mentions the immense cultural value, particu-larly during the Middle Ages, of the Clavis Melitoniae—an orthodox version ofancient symbolism. According to Cardinal Pitra—quoted by Pinedo—an aware-ness of this ‘Key’ is to be found in most mediaeval authors. This is not the placeto give a summary of their ideas or works, but we should like to mention inpassing the important works of: Alan of Lille, De Planctu Naturae; Herrad ofLandsberg, Hortus Deliciarum; Hildegard of Bingen, Scivias Domini, LiberDivinorum Operum Simplicis Hominis; Bernard Silvestris, De Re MundiUniversitate; Hugh of St. Victor, Didascalion, Commentarium in HierarchiamCoelestem, etc. The Key of St. Melito, bishop of Sardis, dates from the 2ndcentury A.D. Some other sources of Christian symbolism are: Rabanus Maurus,Allegoriae in Sacram Scripturam; Odo, bishop of Tusculum; Isidore of Seville,Etymologiarum; Johannes Scotus Erigena, John of Salisbury, William of St. Thierry,etc. St. Thomas Aquinas himself speaks of the pagan philosophers as sources ofexternal and demonstrable proofs of Christian truths. Concerning the intimatenature of mediaeval symbolism, Jung observes that, in those days ‘analogy wasnot so much a logical figure as a secret identity’, that is to say, a continuation ofprimitive, animistic thought (32).The Renaissance also showed great interest in symbolism, although in amanner more individualistic and cultured, more profane, literary and aesthetic.Dante had fashioned his Commedia upon a basis of oriental symbols. In the 15thcentury particular use was made of two Greek writers of the 2nd and 3rd centu-ries A.D. They are Horapollo, with his Hieroglyphica; and the anonymous com-piler of the Physiologus. Horapollo, inspired by the Egyptian hieroglyphic sys-tem, the key to which had been lost by his time, tried to reconstruct its meaningupon the basis of its configuration and elemental symbolism. In 1467, an Italianwriter, Francesco Colonna, wrote a work, Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (publishedin Venice in 1499), which enjoyed widespread success and in which the symbolhad now acquired the particular, mobile significance which has come to character-ize it in modern times. In 1505, Colonna’s editor published Horapollo’s work,which in turn influenced two other important writers at the same time: AndreaAlciati, author of Emblemata (1531), which was to arouse a disproportionatetaste for profane symbolism throughout Europe (Henry Green in his Andrea"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM IN THE WESTxxiiiAlciati and his Books of Emblems, London, 1872, names more than three thou-sand titles of books dealing with emblems); and Giampietro Valeriano, author ofthe compendious Hieroglyphica (1556). In 15th-century painting there is abun-dant evidence of this interest in symbolism: Botticelli, Mantegna, Pinturicchio,Giovanni Bellini, Leonardo, for example; later, during the 16th, 17th and 18thcenturies, this interest tended towards the allegorical. One may say that, from thelatter part of the Middle Ages onwards, the West lost that sense of unity whichcharacterized the symbol and symbolist tradition. Yet proof of its continuedexistence is offered by the occasional revelation of diverse aspects in the work ofpoets, artists and writers, from Giovanni da Udine to Antonio Gaudi, from Boschto Max Ernst. In German Romanticism, the interest in the deeper layers ofpsychic life—in dreams and their meaning, in the unconscious—is the fountwhich has given rise to the present-day interest in symbology, which, althoughstill partially repressed, again dwells in the deep wells of the spirit, as it didbefore being circumscribed by a system with a rigid cosmic pattern. Thus, Schubert,in his Symbolik des Traumes (1837), says: ‘The prototypes of the images andforms utilized by the oneirocritic, poetic and prophetic idioms, can be foundaround us in Nature, revealing herself as a world of materialized dream, as aprophetic language whose hieroglyphics are beings and forms.’ Most of the litera-ture of the first half of the 19th century, especially the Nordic, presupposes afeeling for the symbolic, for the significant. Thus, Ludwig Tieck, in Runenburg,says of his protagonist: ‘Insensitive from that moment to the beauty of flowers,in which he believes he can see “the gaping wound of Nature” throbbing’ (thetheme of Philoctetes as well as of Amfortas in Parsifal), ‘he finds himself drawntowards the mineral world.’Innumerable genera still conserve symbols in semeiotic form, ossified andsometimes degraded from the universal plane to the particular. We have alreadyreferred to literary emblems. In a similar class are the distinctive marks used bymediaeval and Renaissance paper-manufacturers. In this connexion, Bayley saysthat, from their first appearance in 1282 up to the second half of the 18th century,they had an esoteric meaning; and that in them, as in fossils, we can see thecrystallization of the ideals of numerous mystic sects of mediaeval Europe (4).The popular art of all European peoples is another inexhaustable mine of sym-bols. One only has to glance through a work like that of Helmuth Th. Bossert inorder to find amongst the images such well-known subjects as the cosmic tree, thesnake, the phoenix, the ship of death, the bird on the rooftop, the two-headedeagle, the planetary division into two groups of three and of four, grotesques,rhomboids, lines and zigzags, etc. Furthermore, legends and folktales, when their"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF DREAMSxxiveditors have been faithful, as in the case of Perrault and the Grimm brothers, haveretained their mythical and archetypal structure (38). In the same way, in lyricalpoetry, alongside works created within the canons of explicit symbolism—bestillustrated in the works of René Ghil—there are frequent flowerings of symbolicmotifs springing spontaneously out of the creative spirit.THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF DREAMSWhat a myth represents for a people, for any one culture, or for any givenmoment of history, is represented for the individual by the symbolic images ofdreams, by visions and by fantasy or lyricism. This distinction does not implydichotomy: many dreams have been known to express premonitions. But whenthe symbol—or the premonition—goes beyond the particular and the subjective,we find ourselves in the realm of augury and prophecy; symbolic laws can explainboth phenomena, but the latter may be a revelation of the supernatural.Given our contemporary psychoanalytic concept of the ‘unconscious’, wemust accept the placing within it of all those dynamic forms which give rise tosymbols; for, according to Jung’s way of thinking, the unconscious is ‘the matrixof the human mind and its inventions’ (33). The unconscious was ‘discovered’theoretically by Carus, Schopenhauer and Hartmann, and experimentally byCharcot, Bernheim, Janet, Freud and other psychologists. But this newly ac-quired knowledge merely showed to be internal what had formerly been thoughtto be external to Man. For example, Greek seers believed that dreams came from‘without’, that is, from the domain of the gods. Now, esoteric tradition, in accor-dance with the Hindu doctrine of the three planes of consciousness, had alwaysbeen aware that the vertical division of thought could also be seen on three levels:the subconscious (instinctive and affective thought); consciousness (ideologicaland reflexive thought); and superconsciousness (intuitive thought and the highertruths). Hence, by way of simplification, we shall adopt the Jungian term ‘uncon-scious’ instead of ‘subconscious’, since one rightly asks oneself when dealingwith many authors: ‘How can they be so certain that the unconscious is “lower”and not “higher” than the conscious?’ (31).The interest in dreams and their symbolic content goes back to Antiquity,when, although the theory was never consciously formulated, it was implied thatthe phenomenon could be considered as a kind of personal mythology, eventhough the manner of its expression was the objective, collective myth. Thefamous dreams of the Bible; the book of Artemidorus Daldianus; the interpreta-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF DREAMSxxvtive dictionaries of Chaldean, Egyptian and Arabic origin bear witness to theattention paid to dreams as harbingers of hidden truths about the submerged lifeof the psyche and, more rarely, about external and objective facts. The mechanismof oneiromancy, like that of other divinatory or prophetic techniques, is a univer-sal phenomenon; for such techniques are based upon the higher activity of theunconscious in response to certain stimuli, and upon the automatic acquisition ofunconscious stores of knowledge remaining unperceived until ‘read’ in accor-dance with the principles of numbers, orientation, form and space. We must againunderline the way in which Jung approaches this universal phenomenon. He saysthat the fact of ‘an opinion being held for so long and so widely necessarilydemonstrates that in some way it must be true, that is, psychologically true’. Heexplains psychological truth as a fact, not as a judgement or an opinion, and heconsiders that careful demonstration and corroboration are evidence enough forthis (31).Since an extensive bibliography of dreams is already available, it is hereintended only to recall that they afford Man another means of making contactwith his deepest aspirations, with the geometric or moral laws of the universe,and also with the muted stirrings of the submerged unconscious. Teillard pointsout that in dreams all layers of the psyche are revealed, including the deepest. Andjust as the embryo passes through the evolutionary animal stages, so we carrywith us archaic ‘memories’ which can be brought to light (56). On the other hand,Carus believed that the soul was in communion with the cosmic, and that,oneirocritically speaking, the soul was susceptible to truths different from thosewhich rule the waking life; in this way he associated dreams with those ritualswhich enabled Man to enter into the great secrets of Nature. It is usually acceptedthat modern ways of thinking differ from primitive thought-processes only withregard to consciousness, and that the unconscious has hardly changed since theUpper Palaeolithic Stage.Oneirocritic symbols, then, are not strictly different from mythical, religious,lyrical or primitive symbols. Except that, with the primary archetypes, one findsintermixed a kind of subworld consisting of the remains of existential imagesdrawn from reality, which may be lacking in symbolic meaning, which may beexpressions of the physiological—merely memories—or which may also pos-sess a symbolism related to the material and primary forms from which theyoriginate. In this dictionary we have kept to traditional symbols only, but it isevident that other more ‘recent’ symbols must derive from the older—as themotor-car from the carriage—or else must be related through the symbolism of"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLISM OF ALCHEMYxxviform, although this must always be a question of similar symbols, not of thesame symbol nor of the same order of meaning.There is another problem which we cannot ignore: not all human beings are onthe same level. Even if we do not accept the idea of radical differences, or theconcept of spiritual growth—a concept which always has a touch of the orientaland esoteric about it—it is undeniable that differences of intensity (emotion,inner life, richness of thought and feeling) and of quality (intellectual and authen-tically moral education) bring about essentially different levels of thought, whetherit be logical or magical thought, rational speculation or oneirocritic elaboration.Havelock Ellis has pointed out that extraordinary dreams are confined to peopleof genius, and according to Jung even primitive races make a similar distinction;the Elgonyi tribe in the Elgon jungle explained to him that they recognized twotypes of dream: the ordinary dream of the unimportant man, and the ‘greatvision’, generally the exclusive privilege of outstanding men (34). Hence interpre-tative theories of symbolic material must vary according to whether they aredrawn from the analysis of the dreams of more or less pathological individuals,from the dreams of normal people, from those of outstanding men, or fromcollective myths. The materialistic tone pervading the symbolic classifications ofmany psychoanalysts is accounted for by the nature of their sources of informa-tion. On the other hand, the symbology of philosophers, founders of religionsand poets is wholly idealist and cosmic in direction, embracing all objects, seekingafter the infinite and pointing to the mysteries of the mystical ‘centre’. This isverified by Jung, who shows that accounts of fantasy or of dreams alwayscontain not only what is most peremptory for the narrator but also what for themoment is most painful (i.e. most important) for him (31). It is this ‘importance’which fixes the plane upon which any system of interpretation must exist. Freud’sdefinition (‘Every dream is a repressed desire’) points to the same conclusion, forour desires are the index of our aspirations and our potentialities.THE SYMBOLISM OF ALCHEMYIn his On Psychic Energy, Jung has asserted that: ‘The spiritual appears in thepsyche as an instinct, indeed as a real passion. . . It is not derived from any otherinstinct, but is a principle sui generis, that is, a specific and necessary form ofinstinctual power.’ Apart from the fact that this asseveration would seem to putan end to the assumption that science is necessarily materialistic, its importancelies in that it takes up the essential platonic doctrine of the soul, which we here"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLISM OF ALCHEMYxxviiequate with the Jungian principle of spirituality, even though at times it may benecessary to treat the two principles separately. Plato in Timaeus, Plotinus in theEnneads, elaborate the idea that the soul is a stranger on earth, that it has de-scended from the spaceless and timeless universe, or that it has ‘fallen’ on accountof sin into matter, that it initiates a process of life-giving growth corresponding tothe period of involution.At any given moment, the inverse of this downward and inward movementcan be produced: the soul recalls that its origin is beyond space and time, beyondliving creatures and the world of objects, even beyond images; it then tendstowards the annihilation of the corporeal and begins to ascend towards its Origin.Iamblichus explains this as follows: ‘A principle of the soul is that it is superiorto all Nature, and that through it we can rise above the order and the systems ofthe world. When the soul is thus separated from all subordinate natures, it ex-changes this life for another and abandons this order of things to bind itselfinseparably with another.’ The idea of rotation is the keystone of most transcen-dent symbols: of the mediaeval Rota; of the Wheel of Buddhist transformations;of the zodiacal cycle; of the myth of the Gemini; and of the opus of the alche-mists. The idea of the world as a labyrinth or of life as a pilgrimage leads to theidea of the ‘centre’ as a symbol of the absolute goal of Man—Paradise regained,heavenly Jerusalem. Pictorially, this central point is sometimes identified withthe geometric centre of the symbolic circle; sometimes it is placed above it; and atother times, as in the oriental Shri Yantra, it is not portrayed at all, so that thecontemplator has to imagine it.But constantly we find a given theme reappearing under the guise of a newsymbol: the lost object, the impossible or very difficult enterprise; or else itcomes to be equated with a variety of qualities: knowledge, love, obtaining adesired object, etc. Alchemy was developed in two fairly well-defined stages: themediaeval and the Renaissance, the latter terminating by the 18th century, whenit split once again into its two original components: mysticism and chemistry.Alchemy is a symbolic technique which, together with the desire for positivediscoveries in the field of the natural sciences, sought to materialize spiritualtruths. Instead of confronting the mythical dragon in their search for ‘treasure’,like Cadmus, Jason and Siegfried, the alchemists sought to produce it by means ofhard work and virtue. Their work was not aimed at a simple revelation of esoterictruths, nor was it materialistic: both purposes coalesced, however, to achievesomething which for them had the significance of the absolute. Each operation,each detail, every subject, every instrument was a source of intellectual and"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLISM OF ALCHEMYxxviiispiritual life: they were authentic symbols. After being forgotten for a period,alchemy was reassessed as ‘the origin of modern chemistry’, and recentlyBachelard, Silberer, Jung and others have come to see the true completenessof its meaning, at once poetic, religious and scientific. Bachelard points out thatalchemy ‘possesses a quality of psychological precision’ (33) and that, far frombeing a description of objective phenomena, it is an attempt to project humanlove into the ‘heart’ of things (1). Jung insists that the experiments of the alche-mists had the sole purpose—like the ancient techniques of divination, though theformer was more ambitious and persistent—of stimulating the deepest layers ofthe psyche and of facilitating psychic projections in material things, or in otherwords, of experiencing material phenomena as symbols which point to a com-plete theory of the universe and the destiny of the soul. For this reason, he saysthat ‘the investigator had certain psychic experiences which appeared to him asthe particular behaviour of the chemical process’. Elsewhere he defines this as‘chemical research which, through projection, incorporated unconscious psychicmaterial’, a remark which he rounds off by affirming that ‘the real nature of matterwas unknown to the alchemist. He knew it only by allusion. Searching for asolution, he projected the unconscious into the obscurity of matter in order toilluminate it. To explain the mystery of matter, he projected another mystery intowhat was to be explained’ (32). The summa of this mystery, the deepest of secretaspirations, was the coincidentia oppositorum, of which ‘the alchemists are as itwere the empiricists, whereas Nicholas of Cusa is its philosopher’ (33). But thealchemist did not merely pretend to carry out his experiments; he was, indeed,profoundly and pathetically engrossed in his search for gold. It was this interest,together with his sense of dedication that—as in the search for the Holy Grail—was the guarantee of final success, by dint of the virtuous practice which hisunceasing labour demanded. To discover the secret of making gold was the markof divine favour. Jung interprets the process psychologically as the gradual elimi-nation of the impure factors of the spirit in the progress towards the immutablevalues of eternity. But this interpretation had been fully grasped by the alche-mists themselves: Michael Maier, in Symbola Aureae Mensae (1617), says that‘chemistry encourages the investigator to meditate upon celestial blessings’. Dorn,in Physica (1661), alludes to the relationship which must exist between theworker and his research when he asserts: ‘You will never make Oneness out ofOtherness until you yourself have become Oneness.’ Oneness was achieved byannihilating the desire for what is different or transitory and by fixing the mindupon what is ‘higher’ and eternal. Famous indeed is the maxim of the alchemists:Aurum nostrum non est aurum vulgi. This assertion—that their gold was not"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"DEFINITIONS OF THE SYMBOLxxixordinary gold—seems to indicate that their symbolism excluded the materialreality of the symbol, in favour of the spiritual. But, of course, it is hazardous totalk as if the varied work of so many researchers with such differing backgroundswas all of a piece. The demand for actual gold could be interpreted as being thesame as the longing of the doubting St. Thomas. The chosen few were wellcontent with the dream of the ‘subterranean Sun’ shining at the bottom of thealchemist’s oven like the light of salvation within the depths of the soul, no matterwhether this salvation is considered to be the product of religious faith or of thathypothetical ‘process of individuation’ into which Jung seems to have poured hisfinest thoughts and sentiments about Man. Of course, beneath this concept therelie hidden none other than the three supreme longings which seem to lead tofelicity: first, the alchemic Rebis, or the androgynous being, signifying the con-junction of opposites and the cessation of the torment caused by the separationof the sexes, beginning with the time when the ‘spherical man’ of Plato was splitinto two halves; second, the establishing of the ‘volatile’ principle, that is, theannihilation of all change or transition, once the essence has been obtained; and,finally, the concentrating into one central point, as a symbol of the mysticalcentre of the universe—that is, of the irradiant origin (32) and of immortality.DEFINITIONS OF THE SYMBOLDefinitions and analyses of the nature of symbols and of symbolism are all toofrequent. But we should like to study some of the more thoughtful suggestions,keeping, as always in this work, within the limits of comparative analysis. Forthe Hindu philosopher Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, symbolism is ‘the art ofthinking in images’, an art now lost to civilized Man, notably in the last threehundred years, perhaps in consequence of the ‘catastrophic theories of Descartes’,to quote Schneider. Coomaraswamy, then, shares the views of Fromm and ofBayley, explicit in the titles of their respective works: The Forgotten Languageand The Lost Language of Symbolism. However, this loss—as anthropology andpsychoanalysis have shown—is limited to consciousness and not to the ‘uncon-scious’, which, to compensate, is perhaps now overloaded with symbolic mate-rial.Diel considers the symbol to be ‘a precise and crystallized means of expres-sion’, corresponding in essence to the inner life (intensive and qualitative) inopposition to the external world (extensive and quantitative) (15). In this, heagrees with Goethe, who asserted: ‘In the symbol, the particular represents the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"DEFINITIONS OF THE SYMBOLxxxgeneral, not as a dream, not as a shadow, but as a living and momentary revelationof the inscrutable.’ We suggest that the distinction made by Diel between theinner and the outer worlds is a general truth, applicable not only to the Cartesianmethod: the world of res cogitans is one which recognizes extension. How is itpossible, then, for it to ignore the quantitative if the qualitative arises from‘groups’ of quantity?Marc Saunier, in his literary and pseudomystical style, points to an impor-tant characteristic of symbols when he states that they are ‘the synthesizingexpression of a marvellous science, now forgotten by men’, but that ‘they showus all that has been and will be, in one immutable form’ (49). He thereby assignsto symbols—or recognizes, rather—their didactic function as timeless objectsper se, at least in their intimate structure, for the other factors are cultural orpersonal variants.The connexion between created and Creator is also apparent in the symbol.Jules Le Bêle recalls that ‘every created object is, as it were, a reflection of divine-perfection, a natural and perceptible sign of a supernatural truth’, thus echoingthe Pauline proposition Per visibilia ad invisibilia, as well as the assertion ofSallust that ‘The world is a symbolic object.’ Landrit insists that ‘symbolism isthe science of the relations which unite the created world with God, the materialworld with the supernatural; the science of the harmonies existing between thediverse parts of the universe (correspondences and analogies)’, operating withinthe process of involution, that is, of the materiality of all things.Here we must interpose a distinction and a clarification. Erich Fromm (23),steering his course along the normal channels of symbolic knowledge, lays downthree kinds of symbol which are different in degree: (a) the conventional, (b) theaccidental, (c) the universal. The first kind comprises simple acceptance of aconstant affinity stripped of any optical or natural basis: for example, many signsused in industry, in mathematics and in other fields. The second type springsfrom strictly transitory conditions and is due to associations made through casualcontact. The third kind is that which we are now studying and is defined, accord-ing to Fromm, as the existence of the intrinsic relation between the symbol andwhat it represents. It is obvious that this relation does not always have the samevitality. For this reason, as we have already pointed out, it is difficult to classifysymbols with exactitude.This language of images and emotions is based, then, upon a precise andcrystallized means of expression, revealing transcendent truths, external to Man(cosmic order) as well as within him (thought, the moral order of things, psychicevolution, the destiny of the soul); furthermore, it possesses a quality which,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"DEFINITIONS OF THE SYMBOLxxxiaccording to Schneider, increases its dynamism and gives it a truly dramaticcharacter. This quality, the essence of the symbol, is its ability to express simul-taneously the various aspects (thesis and antithesis) of the idea it represents (51).Let us give a provisional explanation of this: the unconscious, or ‘place’ wheresymbols live, does not recognize the inherent distinctions of contraposition; oragain, the ‘symbolic function’ appears at the precise moment when a state oftension is set up between opposites which the consciousness cannot resolve byitself.For psychologists, the symbol exists almost wholly in the mind, and is thenprojected outwards upon Nature, either accepting language as its being and itsform or converting being and form into dramatic characters, but it is not seen inthis way by orientalists and esoteric thinkers, who base symbolism upon theincontrovertible equation macrocosm=microcosm. For this reason René Guénonpoints out that: ‘The true basis of symbolism is, as we have said, the correspon-dence linking together all orders of reality, binding them one to the other, andconsequently extending from the natural order as a whole to the supernaturalorder. By virtue of this correspondence, the whole of Nature is but a symbol, thatis, its true significance becomes apparent only when it is seen as a pointer whichcan make us aware of supernatural or “metaphysical” truths—metaphysical inthe proper and true sense of the word, which is nothing less than the essentialfunction of symbolism. . . . The symbol must always be inferior to the thingsymbolized, which destroys all naturalist concepts of symbolism’ (29). Thislatter idea is repeatedly stressed by Guénon, declaring that ‘what is superior cannever symbolize what is inferior, although the converse is true’ (25) (provided,we must add, that one is dealing with a specific symbol of inversion). On theother hand, what is superior can remind us of what is inferior.The observations of Mircea Eliade are very interesting in this respect. Heassigns to the symbol the mission of going beyond the limitations of this ‘frag-ment’ which is Man (or any one of his concerns) and of integrating this ‘fragment’into entities of wider scope: society, culture, the universe. Even if, within theselimitations, ‘an object transmuted into a symbol—as a result of its being pos-sessed by the symbolic function—tends to unite with the All . . . this union is notthe same as a confusion, for the symbol does not restrict movement or circulationfrom one level to another, and integrates all these levels and planes (of reality),but without fusing them—that is, without destroying them’, integrating them, inshort, within a system. On the other hand, Eliade believes that if the All canappear contained within a significant fragment, it is because each fragment re-states the All: ‘A tree, by virtue of the power it manifests, may become a blessed"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE ‘COMMON RHYTHM’ OF SCHNEIDERxxxiihaven, without ceasing to be a tree; and if it becomes a cosmic tree it is becausewhat it manifests restates, point by point, what the totality manifests’ (17). Herewe have the explanation of the ‘intrinsic relation’ mentioned by Erich Fromm.Though transmuted to another plane of reality, it consists of the essential rela-tionship between one process and another, between one object and another, anintimate relationship which has been defined as rhythm.THE ‘COMMON RHYTHM’ OF SCHNEIDERThe analogy between two planes of reality is founded upon the existence in bothof a ‘common rhythm’. By rhythm we mean here not ‘perceptible order in time’,but the coherent, determinate and dynamic factor which a character or figurepossesses and which is transmitted to the object over which it presides or fromwhich it emanates. This rhythm is fundamentally a movement resulting from acertain vitality or from a given ‘number’. It shows itself as a characteristic expres-sion or formal crystallization. Thus, between the live snake, with its sinuousmovement, and the snake appearing in inanimate relief, there may be an analogywhich is not only formal (in the design, disposition, or in the specific shape of theanimal) but also rhythmic—that is, of tone, of modality, of accent, and of expres-sion.Martin Buber, in his study of natural, primitive poetry, points out thatMan—whether it be megalithic Man, our contemporary Primitive, or ‘romantic’Man seeking natural spontaneity in his relations with the cosmos—’does notthink about the moon as such, which he sees every night; for what he retains is notthe image of a wandering, luminous disc, nor that of an associated demonic being,but that of the immediate emotive image, the lunar fluid flowing through bodies’(quoted by Gaston Bachelard, 2). This is exactly the view of Schneider also,pointing to the aptitude for symbolic and rhythmic thought of Primitive Man,who could identify the movement of a wave with that of the backs of a movingflock of sheep (51). Davy recalls that Boethius had alluded earlier to a ‘commonrhythm’ when he asserted that only those things which have the same matter incommon—meaning, in this context, the same ‘vital aspect’—can mutually trans-form and interchange themselves (14). Rhythm may be understood as a groupingof distances, of quantitative values, but also as a formal pattern determined byrhythmic numbers, that is, as spatial, formal and positional similitude.But there is a deeper meaning to the concept of rhythm, which is preciselythat expounded by Schneider upon the basis of Primitive Man’s identification of"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE ‘COMMON RHYTHM’ OF SCHNEIDERxxxiiione ‘living, dynamic cell’ with two or more different aspects of reality. For thisreason, he points out that: ‘The definition of the common rhythm varies consid-erably according to the culture in question. Primitive beings found related rhythmsparticularly in the timbre of the voice, the rhythm of walking, motion, colour andmaterial. More advanced cultures preserve these criteria, but they give moreimportance to form and material (the visual) than to the criteria of the voice andthe rhythm of walking. Instead of conceiving these related rhythms dynamicallyand artistically as primitive people did, higher cultures think of them as abstractvalues and order them according to a reasoned classification of a static and geo-metric kind. . . . Whereas Primitive Man saw that forms and phenomena areessentially fluid, more advanced civilizations have given pride of place to thestatic aspect of forms and the purely geometric outlines of shape’ (50).Rhythms and modes, then, allow relationships to be established betweendifferent planes of reality. While natural science establishes relationships onlybetween ‘horizontal’ groups of beings after the classification of Linnaeus, mysticor symbolic science erects ‘vertical bridges’ between those objects which arewithin the same cosmic rhythm, that is, objects whose position ‘corresponds’ tothat of another ‘analogous’ object on another plane of reality: for example, ananimal, a plant or a colour. According to Schneider, this idea of correspondencescomes from belief in the indissoluble unity of the universe. Thus, in megalithicand astrobiological cultures, the most disparate phenomena are brought together,by virtue of their having a ‘common rhythm’; ‘hence one finds that such elementsas the following are correlated: musical or cultural instruments and implements ofwork; animals, gods, and heavenly bodies; the seasons, the points of the com-pass, and material symbols; rites, colours and offices; parts of the human bodyand phases in human life’ (51). Symbolism is what might be called a magneticforce, drawing together phenomena which have the same rhythm and even allow-ing them to interchange. Schneider deduces some important ontological conclu-sions from this: The apparent multiplicity of outward forms spreading out overconcentric planes is deceptive, for, in the last resort, all the phenomena of theuniverse can be reduced to a few basic rhythmic forms, grouped and ordered bythe passage of time’ (51). He also draws gnostical conclusions: ‘The symbol is theideological manifestation of the mystic rhythm of creation and the degree of truthattributed to the symbol is an expression of the respect Man is able to accord tothis mystical rhythm’ (50). The rhythmic link between the world outside Manand the physiology of Man is demonstrated by Schneider’s affirming that Primi-tive Man and his animal-totem—though different beings—are joined in a com-mon rhythm, whose basic element is the cry-symbol (51). Jung has amplified the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"JUNG’S ARCHETYPExxxivpsychological implications of this concept, demonstrating the deep and constantrelationship between rhythm and emotion (31).At this point we must comment upon the conclusion implicit in Schneider’sthesis that, in spite of the multiplicity of forms which phenomena seem to takeon, there is a lack of clearly independent forms in the universe. Indeed, morphol-ogy in its systematic analysis of forms has found that only a few are fundamental:this is particularly true of biology, in which the ovoid is a basic form from whichthe sphere, its segment and many intermediate forms are derived. In fact,symbological analyses often seem to offset a certain narrowing of scope by anadded richness in depth, for the few basic situations that do exist appear undervarying, though secondary, guises. Similarly, the only ‘original’ numbers are thefirst decade of the Greek system or the numbers up to twelve in the orientalsystem. The rest come under the rule of ‘multiplicity’, which is merely a reorder-ing of the basic series. Besides, the place of symbolism is within the archetypalpattern of each being, each form, each rhythm. Within this archetypal pattern,thanks to the principle of concentration, all like beings can be presented as onebeing. And in addition, by virtue of this oneness, the predominant rhythm trans-mutes all that might appear to be separate; so that, to give an example, not onlydo all dragons stand for The Dragon, but any symbolic daub resembling a dragonis also The Dragon. And we shall see that this is a consequence of the principle of‘sufficient identity’.JUNG’S ARCHETYPEIn the equation macrocosm=microcosm there is the implied possibility of ex-plaining the former by the latter, or vice versa. The ‘common rhythm’ of Schneiderbelongs rather to the tendency to explain Man by reference to the world, whileJung’s ‘archetype’ tends to explain the world by reference to Man. This is logical,since the archetype does not stem from forms or from figures or objective beings,but from images within the human spirit, within the turbulent depths of theunconscious. The archetype is, in the first place, an epiphany, that is, the revela-tion of the latent by way of the recondite: vision, dream, fantasy, myth. Thesespiritual manifestations are not, for Jung, substitutes for living things—are notlifeless effigies; they are the fruits of the inner life perpetually flowing out fromthe unconscious, in a way which can be compared with the gradual unfolding ofcreation. Just as creation determines the burgeoning of beings and objects, so"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"JUNG’S ARCHETYPExxxvpsychic energy flowers into an image, an entity marking the true borders betweenthe informal and the conceptual, between darkness and light.Jung uses the word ‘archetype’ to designate those universal symbols whichpossess the greatest constancy and efficiency, the greatest potentiality for psy-chic evolution, and which point away from the inferior towards the superior. InOn Psychic Energy, he specifically says: ‘The psychological mechanism thattransforms energy is the symbol.’ But, in addition, he appears to give a differentmeaning to the archetype, linking it strictly with the structure of the psyche,when he distinguishes it from the symbol in so far as its ontic significance goes.To clarify this, let us quote some of Jung’s own observations: ‘The archetypesare the numinous, structural elements of the psyche and possess a certain au-tonomy and specific energy which enables them to attract, out of the consciousmind, those contents which are best suited to themselves. The symbols act astransformers, their function being to convert libido from a “lower” into a “higher”form. . . . It was manifestly not a question of inherited ideas, but of an inborndisposition to produce parallel images, or rather of identical psychic structurescommon to all men, which I later called the archetypes of the collective uncon-scious. They correspond to the concept of the “pattern of behaviour” in biology’(31). ‘The archetypes do not represent anything external, non-psychic, althoughthey do of course owe the concreteness of their imagery to impressions receivedfrom without. Rather, independently of, and sometimes in direct contrast to, theoutward forms they may take, they represent the life and essence of a non-individual psyche’ (33). That is to say, there is an intermediate realm between theoneness of the individual soul and its solitude, and the variety of the universe:between the res cogitans and the res extensa of Descartes, and that realm is theimage of the world in the soul and of the soul in the world, in other words, the‘place’ of symbolism ‘working’ in areas prepared by the archetypes—eternallypresent, the ‘problem being whether the consciousness perceives them or not’(32).In his Essais de psychologie analytique, Jung again defines the nature of thearchetypes as the ready-made systems of both images and emotions (that is, ofrhythms). They are inherited with the brain-structure—indeed, they are its psy-chic aspect. They are, on the one hand, the most powerful of instinctive preju-dices, and on the other, the most efficient aids imaginable towards instinctiveadaptations. Jung points out that the idea of such ‘image-guides’ of ancestralorigin had already appeared in Freud, who called them ‘primitive fantasies’. Jolande Jacobi, in her work on Jung’s psychology (30), says that Jung took the expres-sion from St. Augustine, who used it in a sense which is very similar to the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF THE SYMBOLxxxviplatonic ‘idea’, that is, the primordial reality from which the realities of existencearise as echoes and fragments. Archetypes are like all-embracing parables: theirmeaning is only partially accessible; their deepest significance remains a secretwhich existed long before Man himself and which reaches out far beyond Man.Jolan de Jacobi identifies symbols for practical purposes with the archetypes,mentioning as examples of the latter: the ‘night sea-crossing’, the ‘whale-dragon’,figures such as the prince, the child, the magician or the unknown damsel. Wecannot further debate Jung’s concepts without going more deeply into his psy-chological and anthropological theory, which would be beyond the scope of thiswork. To return to the relationship between, or identity of, the symbol and thearchetype, we might say that the latter is the mythical and merely human aspectof the former, whereas a strict system of symbols could exist even withouthuman consciousness, since it is founded upon a cosmic order determined bythose ‘vertical’ relationships which we mentioned when commenting upon the‘common rhythm’ of Schneider. In short, it is a synthesis which transmutessystems of vibrations, echoing one basic and original ‘model’, into a spiritualidiom expressed usually in the numerical series.ANALYSIS OF THE SYMBOLThe basic ideas and suppositions which allow us to conceive of ‘symbolism’,together with the creation and vitality of each symbol, are the following:(a) Nothing is meaningless or neutral: everything is significant. (b) Nothing isindependent, everything is in some way related to something else. (c) The quan-titative becomes the qualitative in certain essentials which, in fact, preciselyconstitute the meaning of the quantity. (d) Everything is serial. (e) Series arerelated one to another as to position, and the components of each series arerelated as to meaning. This serial characteristic is a basic phenomenon which is astrue of the physical world (in its range of colours, of sounds, of textures, oflandscapes, etc.) as of the spiritual world (in its virtues, vices, humours, feelings,etc.). Factors which account for serial arrangement are: limitation; the integrationof discontinuity and continuity; proper order; graduation; numbering; the innerdynamism of the component elements; polarity; symmetrical or asymmetricalequilibrium; and the concept as a whole.If we take any ‘symbol’—for example, the sword, or the colour red—andanalyse its structure, we shall see that it can be split up into both its real and itssymbolic components. First, we find the object in itself, in isolation; in the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF THE SYMBOLxxxviisecond place we find the object linked to its utilitarian function, to its concrete orfactual reality in the three-dimensional world—directly, in the case of the sword;or indirectly, giving colour, for example to a cloak, in the case of the colour red; inthe third place, we find what enables the object to be considered as a symbol: thatstructure which we have termed ‘symbolic function’, or the dynamic tendency ofthe object to link up with its corresponding equivalents in all analogous series,nevertheless principally tending to show the particular metaphysical meaning. Inthis symbolic function we can still distinguish between the symbolic meaning andEngraving in the Historiarum liber of Herodotus (Paris, 1510 with the important symbols of the primordial waters,ship, woman, bees and phoenix"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"ANALYSIS OF THE SYMBOLxxxviiithe general meaning, the latter being requently ambivalent and charged with allu-sions whose variety, however, is never chaotic, for it is marshalled along the co-ordinate line of a ‘common rhythm’.Thus, the sword, iron, fire, the colour red, the god Mars, the rocky mountain,are all interrelated because they are oriented along one ‘symbolic line’. They allimply the longing for ‘spiritual determination and physical annihilation’, which isthe profoundest meaning of their symbolic functions; but in addition they arejoined together—they beckon to each other, one might say—by virtue of theinner affinity that binds all these phenomena, which are, in truth, concomitants ofone essential cosmic modality.In consequence, apart from this network of relations linking up every kind ofobject (physical, metaphysical, mental, real and unreal in so far as they have‘psychological reality’), the symbolic order is established by a general correlationbetween the material and the spiritual (the visible and the invisible) and by theunfolding of their meanings. These components, which account for the ‘mode ofbeing’ of the object, may be complementary or disparate; in the case of the latteran ambivalent symbol is produced. Schneider mentions the flute as an example(50). The flute in form is phallic and masculine, whereas its sound is feminine. Itis an instrument which stands in curious, inverse relation to the drum, with itsdeep masculine tones and its rounded, feminine shapes. One indispensable aspectof the relationship between abstract forms (geometric or biomorphic, intellectualor artistic) and objects is the mutual influence they have upon each other. Let usanalyse another symbol: water, for example. Its predominant characteristics are:(i) it fertilizes; (ii) it purifies; (iii) it dissolves. These three qualities have so muchin common that their relationship can be expressed in a variety of ways, althoughone constant factor always emerges: the suspension of form—that is, the lack ofany fixed form (fluidity)—is bound up with the functions of fertilization orregeneration of the material, living world on the one hand, and with the purifica-tion or regeneration of the spiritual world on the other. It is this bond which helpsto explain the vast symbolism of water, appearing in the midst of solid areas ofthe cosmos, with the power of destroying the corrupt and of initiating a newcycle of life—the latter meaning is one that extends to the zodiacal signs ofAquarius and Pisces, and confirms the words of the Psalm: ‘I am poured out likewater, and all my bones are out of joint’ (Psalm xxii, 14).These basic concepts, then, are the justification and the fundament of thesymbolic order of things. Jung, however, working within the framework of hissymbolic logic, does not accord them the same priority. Speaking of the libido, orvital energy, he says that we have the following possibilities of symbolization: (i)"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"SYMBOLIC ANALOGYxxxixAnalogous comparison (that is, a comparison between two objects or forces onthe same co-ordinate of a ‘common rhythm’), as, for example, fire and the sun. (ii)The objective, causative comparison (which is based upon the properties of thesymbolic object itself), as, for example, the sun as life-giver. (iii) The subjective,causative comparison (which functions like the second group, except that itimmediately identifies the inner force with some symbol or some object possess-ing a relevant symbolic function), as, for example, the phallus or snake. (iv) Thefunctional comparison, based not upon symbolic objects themselves but upontheir activity, informing the image with dynamism and drama; for example, thelibido fecundates like the bull, is dangerous like the boar, etc. The relevance tomyth of this last group is self-evident (31).SYMBOLIC ANALOGYAccording to the Tabula Smaragdina, the threefold principle of the analogybetween the outer and the inner world is: (i) the common source of both worlds;(ii) the influence of the psychic upon the physical; (iii) the influence of thephysical world upon the spiritual. But the analogy lies not only in the relationbetween the inner and the outer world, but also in the relation between the variousphenomena of the physical world. Material or formal resemblance is only one ofthe many possible analogies, for analogy can also exist in connexion with func-tion. At times, the act of choosing reveals a basic analogy between the innermotives and the ultimate goal. Let us quote some examples of analogy by way ofclarification. From religious literature we learn that the Order of St. Bruno pre-ferred precipitous and remote places for their communities; the Benedictineswould choose mountain-heights; the Cistercians, pleasant valleys; and the Jesuitsof St. Ignatius, the cities. For those conversant with the character of these foun-dations it is almost unnecessary to point out that their very choice of situationimplies a landscape-symbolism, or that, looked at in another way, the placesselected are eloquent proof of the guiding spirit behind each of these communi-ties.The Pigmies of Equatorial Africa believe that, in the rainbow, God expressesHis desire to communicate with them. This is why, as soon as the rainbowappears, they take up their bows and shoot at it. . . . (17). The incomparablebeauty of this striking image tells us more about analogy than any analysis can.Other aspects of the same kind of thing may be seen in certain superstitions, suchas the belief of many races that by undoing the bolts, locks and latches of the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"SYMBOLIC ANALOGYxlhome during the birth of an infant, they can facilitate its coming into the world(21). One more analogy: the process of creation—which oriental theogonies ex-plain as both progressive multiplication and as division, since all things derivefrom unity—has its analogous counterpart in the related myths of the carving upof the body of Osiris in Egypt, of Prajapati in India and of Dionysos in Greece(40). As examples of formal analogy or resemblance, we quote four symbolicways of referring to the Centre: the Hindu Wheel of Transformations in the centreof which is a space which is either quite unadorned or else filled with just thesymbol or image of a deity; or the Chinese Pi, a disc of jade with a hole in thecentre; or the idea that the Pole star, piercing the sky, points the way along whichthe merely temporal world must move in order to rid itself of the restrictions oftime and space; or, finally, in the West, the Round Table with the Holy Grailstanding at its centre point. We can see in all these very different objects an almostobsessive repetition of the image of a duality: the centre contrasted with thecircumference, as a twofold image of the ineffable origin of the world of phenom-ena. But there is one legend which opens up great possibilities in analogy, for itcontains both formal analogy (resemblance) and functional analogy. It is the mythof the cursed hunter, who leaves the Mass just when the Consecrated Form isbeing raised aloft, to go hunting. One can see delineated here a spiral movementwhich ‘repeats’ the creation of the physical world. The soul abandons the centre(the circular form of the Host) and leaves for the outer part of the wheel, wheremovement is swifter (symbolized by the endless chase after an unattainablequarry).Analogy, as a unifying and ordering process, appears continuously in art,myth and poetry. Its presence always betrays a mystic force at work, the need toreunite what has been dispersed. Let us quote two cases—one of art criticism, theother literary but bearing upon the first—which have analogy as their sole foun-dation. Cohn-Wiener says ‘Reliefs enable us to appreciate that there (in Babylon)clothes do not emphasize the shape of the body, as in Egypt: they hide it, in theway that murals conceal the rough marks of a building.’ Théophile Gautier char-acterized Burgos cathedral as: ‘Vast as a stone pyramid and delicate as a woman’scurl’, and Verlaine called the Middle Ages (which had created this cathedral):‘Vast and delicate’.We have to persist in our study of analogy, for it is perhaps the corner-stoneof the whole symbolic edifice. If we take two parallel actions, as expressed in thephrases: ‘The sun overcomes the darkness’, and ‘The hero slays the monster’,there is a correspondence between the two phrases (and the two actions). Wehave to conceive of each one as a three-part series: subject, verb, predicate. There"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"SYMBOL AND ALLEGORYxliis an analogy in function: both subjects, both verbs, both predicates are interre-lated. In addition, as we have chosen two actions with a ‘common rhythm’, theparts of the series could be replaced or interchanged without causing any break orconfusion in the system: we could equally well say. ‘The sun slays the monster’or ‘The hero overcomes the darkness’. To take another example, in the parallelexpressions: ‘The sun shines with golden brilliance’ and ‘Gold shines with goldenbrilliance’, the common predicate allows not only the interchange but also theidentical equation of subject. From the intermediate phrase: ‘The sun shines likegold’ or ‘Gold shines like the sun’, comes the irrefutable conclusion: ‘The sun—in so far as its brilliance is golden—is gold.’ This equation occurs not because ofthe intrinsic value of its components but because of the significance of theirposition, for the relationship is concerned only with the dynamic or, in otherwords, symbolic, position of objects. This identical equation, then, is what wehave called ‘the principle of sufficient identity’ and what we consider to be thecore of symbolism. Clearly, this identity is ‘sufficient’ (that is, sufficient forsymbolic purposes) from the very moment it is created in the very heart of thedynamic potential of the symbol. When their functions coincide and reveal theirallegiance to one essence, both objects, although different on the existential plane,become one on the symbolic plane and therefore interchangeable; they are now—to use the scholastic terms—the coniunctio (integrating conjunction) of what wasformerly distinctio. This is why symbolic technique is a matter of progressivelyordering such identities within genuine common rhythms. Also, for the abovereasons, the symbolic image is not an ‘example’ (an external and hypotheticalrelation between two objects or two correspondences) but an internal analogy (anecessary and constant relationship).SYMBOL AND ALLEGORY—SYMBOL AND ARTISTIC EXPRESSIONAs a general rule, writers on the subject distinguish in essence between the sym-bol and the allegory. Bachelard (3) defines the latter as ‘a lifeless image, a conceptwhich has become over-rationalized’. For Jung (30), allegory is a limited kind ofsymbol reduced to the rôle of a pointer, designating only one of the many poten-tial series of dynamic meanings. Again, the difference between allegory and sym-bol may be understood by reference to the hypothesis of Wirth, for whom theessential function of the symbol is to explore the unknown and—paradoxically—to communicate with the incommunicable, the partial discovery of these unfath-omable truths being achieved through symbols (59). Diel illustrates the difference"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"SYMBOL AND ALLEGORYxliibetween allegory and symbol with a vivid example: ‘Zeus hurls a thunderbolt,which on the meteorological plane is a straightforward allegory. This allegory istransmuted into a symbol when the act acquires a psychological meaning, Zeusbecoming the symbol of the spirit and the thunderbolt symbolizing the suddenappearance of an illuminating thought (intuition) which is supposed to comefrom the god himself’ (15). This cipher is a semeiotic expression, a conventionalabbreviation for a known constant. Allegory is seen therefore as the mechanism ofthe symbol, in which the chief characteristic of the latter is devitalized and turnedinto a mere cipher which, because it is dressed up in traditional, symbolic garb,may even appear to be alive.Allegories have often been created quite consciously with theatrical or liter-ary ends in mind. Cesare Ripa’s Iconologia is a vast thesaurus of personificationsand allegories. Mythological dictionaries provide many examples in which realis-tic portrayal deprives them of symbolic value. Thus, according to Cochin, Cru-elty is depicted as a fearful hag smothering a child in its cradle and laughing in thefirelight; and Dusk as a youth with a star on his forehead and the black wings ofa bat, fleeing beneath a veil representing night. Even more mechanical are theallegories representing science, the arts or industry. Cosmography is usuallyshown as an old woman; she wears a blue cape studded with stars while her dressis earth-coloured. In one hand she holds an astrolabe, in the other a compass. Ather feet are the globes of the earth and the heavens. These examples prove that theelements of allegory are symbols which are in no way distinguishable from truesymbols. Their function alone is modified and inverted, for, instead of indicatingmetaphysical and spiritual principles—instead of possessing an emotional con-tent—they are artificial creations designating physical realities and nothing else.But in certain circumstances the components of allegory can revert to theirsymbolic state, that is, if the unconscious seizes upon them as such, overlookingtheir semeiotic and representational ends. Hence we may speak of an intermedi-ate zone of images consciously created, even if calling upon ancestral memories,perhaps through the medium of dreams or visions. We find an example of this inthe playing-cards of the Tarot, the compositions of which seem to be carried outaccording to a criterion analogous to that of many allegories or mythical figures.The only difference is that their mysteriousness places them beyond the reach ofreason and enables them to act as stimuli to the unconscious. The same thingfrequently happens in art: symbols have come to be placed within conscious,traditional and dogmatic systems, but their inner life still pulses beneath thisrationalized order, even becoming audible from time to time. In ornamentation,strict rhythm rather than symbolic rhythm is at work. The inner force of the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"APPRECIATION AND INTERPRETATIONxliiirhythm is conveyed to the observer who is moved by it according to his nature,but it is rare for even the suspicion of a psychological or cosmic significance torise to the surface of his consciousness, although he may perceive its dynamicessence. We have read with interest René Alleau’s recent work, De la Nature dessymboles, and find the distinctions he draws between symbol and synthemainteresting from a formalistic standpoint but of less help than hindrance towardsthe proper understanding of the spiritual and psychological meaning of symbols.The same thing occurs with artistic expression, which may be related tosymbolization but must not be confused with it. Artistic expression is a continu-ous, flowing, causal and direct relation between the inspiration and the finalrepresentation, which is both the means and the end of the expressive process.Symbolization is discontinuous, static, indirect, transcending the object in whichit is enshrined. In music and in painting, one can easily distinguish between theexpressive and the symbolic factors. But since we cannot here go into suchparticulars, we shall confine ourselves to determining the parts played by thesefactors in some general artistic tendencies. Thus expressionism, confronted withthe material world of objects, tends to destroy them and to submerge them in aswirling stream of psychic forces, overwhelming the expressive figures and, withits power, obliging them to become part of a system of free rhythms. Symbolism,on the other hand, while isolating each form and each figure, attracts, as if withmagnetic lines of force, all that has ‘common rhythm’, that is, all that has naturalaffinity. It thus reveals that the profound meaning behind all series of symbolicobjects is the very cause of their appearance in the world of phenomena. Con-cerning the relationship of the art-form with the author, let us refer again to theconcept of endopathy, anticipated by Dante in his Canzoniere: ‘He who wouldpaint a figure, if he cannot become that figure, cannot portray it.’ This is a furtheraffirmation of ‘common rhythm’, like the earlier observation of Plotinus that theeye could not see the sun unless it became to some degree a sun itself and viceversa. In symbolist doctrine, there is never any question of mere relation betweencause and effect but rather of ‘mutual causality’. In symbolism, everything hassome meaning, everything has a purpose which at times is obvious, and at othersless so, and everything leaves some trace or ‘signature’ which is open to investi-gation and interpretation.Perhaps a deeper conception than the scientific ones is that of Sufic mysti-cism. Henry Corbin, in Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn ‘Arabi (London,1969), referring to the idea of the ta’wil professed in Sufism, states that it isessentially a method of symbolic understanding of the world, based on the trans-mutation of everything visible into symbols. He adds that this is practicable"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"APPRECIATION AND INTERPRETATIONxlivthrough the ‘intuition of an essence or person in an Image which partakes neitherof universal logic nor of sense perception, and which is the only means of signi-fying what is to be signified’. Sufism admits an intermediate kingdom (an‘interworld’, as it is called) between phenomenic reality and logical or ideal real-ity. This interworld is the pure truth of all things, but elevated to a magicomystic,angelic position. In other words, according to this doctrine, the Oneness, beforereaching material realities, multiplies itself into other realities, which must per-force be objects of amazed contemplation. (These other realities are materialrealities which have been transformed and appear in the function of their domi-nant quality, their spiritual ‘office’.) Asín Palacios, in his Escatología musulmanaen la Divina Commedia, proved the connexion between Dantean idealism and theIslamic study of the contemplative life.APPRECIATION AND INTERPRETATIONThe Problem of Interpretation In the 19th century, mythology and symbolismwere much discussed, particularly in connexion with the problem of interpreta-tion. Max Müller derived the majority of myths from solar phenomena, in par-ticular Dawn representing victory over Darkness, while Schwartz and his schoolgave pride of place to the storm (35). Soon another interpretative approach cameinto being, in which all celestial and meteorological images came to be consideredas secondary to mental and spiritual symbols. So, for example, Karl O. Müller, inhis Kleine deutsche Schriften, remarked that, essentially, the myth of Orion hadnothing astral about it, and that only subsequently did it come to be placed in theheavens. This process of projecting the worldly into the celestial sphere, inparticular into the astral, is known as catasterism. The arrival of the psychologi-cal thesis, however, did not invalidate the arguments for celestial provenance—such as those put forward by Dupuis in his L’Origine de tous les cultes—and thisis yet a further proof that the symbol is plurisignal, a term first used by PhilipWheelwright. Basically, all these problems of ‘origin’ are of very secondary im-portance. From the point of view of symbolist tradition, there is no question ofpriority, only of simultaneity: all phenomena are parallel and related. Interpreta-tions only indicate the starting-point of the interpreter, not the causal or priorcondition within the system itself.These inevitable qualifications inherent in symbolic interpretation are under-lined by Gaston Bachelard in his prologue to Diel (15), when he says, not withoutirony: ‘Are you a rationalist historian? You will find in myth an account of"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONxlvfamous dynasties. Are you a linguist? Words tell all, and all legends are formedaround sayings. One more corrupted word—one more god! Olympus is a gram-mar controlling the functions of the gods. Are you a sociologist? Then in mythyou will find the means by which, in primitive society, the leader is turned into agod.’ The only all-embracing interpretation which would seem to fit the originalmeaning of myths and symbols is the one that takes this meaning right back to themetaphysical source, to the dialectic of creation. Louis Renou praises Zimmer’s‘intuitive appreciation of the metaphysical approach to the myth’, which is tosay, his fidelity to his subject, an approach embracing both the philosophical andthe religious aspects (60). But argument about all the possible interpretationsdates not from our times, nor from recent times, but from Antiquity. Seznecrecalls that the ancients evolved theories about the origins of the gods, based uponinterpretations which can be summed up as expressions of three essential atti-tudes: (a) myths are more or less modified accounts of historical facts, of peopleraised to the rank of gods, as happened in historical time with Alexander theGreat; (b) myths express the conflicts inherent in the natural world, for whichreason gods had to be supernatural, cosmic symbols; (c) myths are the fabulousexpression of philosophical or moral ideas. We would rather say that myths, anda great number of other archetypal symbols, are all three things at once. Or betterstill, that they are concrete, historical realities, that they are at once cosmic andnatural; moral and psychological realities are merely restatements on three planes(history, the physical world, the psychic world) of the same basic ideas.Euhemerism, a system which gives preference to historical interpretation, doesnot, however, in any way affect the nature of symbol or myth, because, as wehave already said, the simultaneous occurrence of an abstract and general manifes-tation with its materialization in a moment of space-time not only implies nocontradiction, but actually is a proof of their true existence on both planes.In the world of symbols, totemistic interpretation does no more than demon-strate relationships, without elucidating meanings: it forges connecting-links be-tween beings endowed with ‘common rhythm’, but it does not indicate the mean-ing of these beings. To say that Athena was the nocturnal owl, the Magna Matera lioness or Artemis a she-bear, is to say nothing about the meaning of the godsnor about their respective animal-symbols. The analysis of meaning is the onlything which can lead to the reconstruction of the inner structure of each symbol.Similarly, realism, which sees in a fable merely a different version of the originalevent or an amalgam of varied elements, offers only a secondary explanation ofthe problem of ‘origins’ without attempting to go deeply into the raison d’être ofthe entity. To say that the image of the bat gave birth to the idea of the hippogryph,"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONxlvithe chimaera and the dragon, is to give the minimal idea of the expressive andsymbolic value of such fabulous animals; only an analysis of their context, theirbehaviour and their purpose can bring us close to the myth of the symbol with itsconsiderable capacity for dynamic transfiguration. Krappe is speaking in termsof realism when he says that the well-known tradition of associating the tree withthe serpent can be traced ‘quite simply to the fact (easily verifiable in all countrieswhere snakes live) that these reptiles generally make their holes at the foot of atree’ (35). Even if we grant the accuracy of this explanation, what could it tell usabout the intensity of this myth, with its powerful symbolism expressing Bibli-cal temptation? Clearly, symbolism is something quite different. It is the magne-tism which reality—whether it be simple (the object) or complex (the relation-ship)—is seen to exert by virtue of its spiritual potential within the cosmicsystem. The snake and the tree are related analogously in their outlines, in theresemblance of the reptile to the roots of a tree, and in the relationship betweenthe tree and the erect snake on the one hand, and the columns of Boaz and Jachinon the other: a binary image of the essential paradox of life—the paradox of Goodand Evil. While the tree raises its branches to the sun as if in an ecstasy ofadoration, the snake is poised ready to strike. This is the essence of the symboland not the fact that snakes nest at the foot of a tree. What is more, applying thetraditional law that facts never explain anything but are the mere consequence ofprinciple, we can say that if the snake makes its nest beneath trees, this isprecisely because of this inner relationship.PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONGiven that every symbol ‘echoes’ throughout every plane of reality and that thespiritual ambience of a person is essentially one of these planes because of therelationship traditionally established between the macrocosm and the micro-cosm, a relationship which philosophy has verified by presenting Man as the‘messenger of being’ (Heidegger): given this, then it follows that every symbolcan be interpreted psychologically. So, for example, the secret room of Bluebeard,which he forbids his wife to enter, is his mind. The dead wives which she encoun-ters in defying his orders are the wives whom he has once loved, that is, who arenow dead to his love. Jung emphasizes the twofold value of psychological inter-pretation; it has thrown new light upon dreams, daydreams, fantasies and worksof art, while on the other hand it provides confirmation of the collective characterof myths and legends (31). He also points out that there are two aspects of the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONxlviiinterpretation of the unconscious: what the symbol represents in itself (objectiveinterpretation), and what it signifies as a projection or as an individualized ‘case’(subjective interpretation). For our part, objective interpretation is nothing morenor less than understanding. Subjective interpretation is true interpretation: ittakes the widest and profoundest meaning of a symbol in any one given momentand applies it to certain given examples.Psychological interpretation points the middle way between the objectivetruth of the symbol and the particular circumstances influencing the individualwho experiences the symbol. The prejudices of the interpreter must, in varyingdegrees, also be taken into account, for it will often be difficult to wean him fromhis particular likes and dislikes. It is here that symbols acquire secondary, acci-dental and transitory meanings, quite apart from their universal quality. Thesword, without ever losing its objective meaning (which we explained earlier)comes to acquire various secondary meanings—which may even, because of itsvital potential, appear momentarily as the primary sense—according to whetherthe symbol occurs in the mind of a soldier, a priest, a collector of swords or apoet. And this is to mention only one limiting factor, in itself extensive enough,embracing, as it does, character-study. The symbol, then, like water, finds its ownlevel, which is the level of the interpreting mind. The difficulties of interpretationare therefore enormous, whereas the difficulties in the way of appreciating thesymbol are almost elementary. Much scepticism about symbolism—especiallyamong psychologists—arises because of the confusion of two quite differentaspects of the function of symbolism: (i) the manifestation of the true meaning ofthe symbolic object, and (ii) the manifestation of a distorted meaning superim-posed by an individual mind prejudiced by circumstantial or psychological fac-tors. The difficulties of psychological interpretation concern not so much theseries of ‘multivalencies’ of the symbol (common rhythm), as the variety ofoutlook of the interpreting mind, influenced either unconsciously by the powerof the symbol or consciously by his own Weltanschauung.One example of this kind of prejudiced interpretation can be seen in theFreudians, who claimed to unveil the universal sexuality of all objects and formsbecause they demonstrably belonged to one or the other of two broadly opposedgroups: the masculine and the feminine. But the Chinese, with their Yang-Yinsymbol, and the Hindus, and the Hebrews had long ago established the essentialpolarity of the world of phenomena according to generic principles, including thesexual division. Nevertheless, no matter how an object might be classified, itwould never lose its potential significance; for its grouping constitutes only oneof its symbolic representations and not, of course, the most important. The"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONxlviiiTalmud, furthermore, had discovered the interesting method of interpreting sexualdreams not always as immediately meaningful but often as indirectly significantor portentous (Fromm, 23). To dream of sexual relations with, for example, one’smother signified the attainment of the highest degree of wisdom. That Romandivines were also aware of this is proved by the interpretation given to a similardream of Julius Caesar, to whom it was prophesied that he would inherit theworld. But on the other hand one cannot deny those psychological interpreta-tions which point to sexual ends. When a man, in the Talmud, ‘sprinkles an olivetree with olive oil’, he betrays symbolically an incestuous desire. The distortionof symbols inherent in any method of psychological interpretation derived fromabnormal minds and applied to abnormal conditions may be seen in the patternsof meaning evolved by Volmat in his L’Art psychopathologique. For him, thesymbol ‘grows around a dynamic system, that is, around a structure within thedimensions of time and personality’. Such distortion of the true meaning ofsymbols arises from an over-restriction of their function, from over-identificationwith the psychological mechanism which construes it and with the alter ego,although it makes up for this restriction by its added intensity. Everything ismade as subjective as possible: the tree is no longer the cosmic tree, but a projec-tion of the self; and similarly with mountains. Water and fire present only theirnegative and destructive connotations, not the positive ones of purification andregeneration. By associations, only the tragic and mournful connotations areinvestigated: such is the construction put upon flowers and animals, for example.In the same way, this kind of interpretation overruns the object, altering it wher-ever necessary to fit abnormal symbols. Houses lose their doors and windows(symbols of openings, outlets, hopes of salvation); trees lose their leaves andnever bear fruit. Catastrophes, which in traditional symbolism have the ambiva-lent meaning of both destruction and of fecundation and regeneration, are herelimited to negative and destructive functions. One can understand that symbol-ogy built upon interpretation at this level can lay no claim to objectivity: it is nolonger metaphysical but psychological.On the other hand, to limit symbolic interpretation to the analysis of mean-ing, or to enumerating the qualities of the thing and its spiritual counterparts, isnot enough. Not because the method is inherently deficient, but because in prac-tice no one can see clearly and wholly what the object in question is.A confrontation with symbolist tradition therefore becomes necessary, atradition with secular associations and interpretations of undoubted value anduniversality; it is, then, essential to apply the comparative method wheneverpossible."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"LEVELS OF MEANINGxlixLEVELS OF MEANINGCorresponding to the multiplicity of symbolic objects linked by a ‘commonrhythm’ is the multivalency of their meanings, each one distributed analogouslyon a separate level of reality. This power of the symbol to evince a meaning notonly on one level but at all levels is borne out by all those who have written aboutsymbology, notwithstanding their scientific outlook. Mircea Eliade stresses thisessential characteristic of the symbol, emphasizing the simultaneity of its differ-ent meanings (17)—although, strictly, instead of ‘different meanings’ one oughtto speak of the different values and particular aspects assumed by the basicmeaning. Schneider gives a vivid example of this kind of progressive ordering ofmeaning, with its separate patterns on each plane of reality. He notes that if wetake three fundamental planes: (i) vegetable and meteorological life; (ii) naturalhuman life; and (iii) spiritual growth; then the concepts of death and rebirth—respectively symbolized by the moon in its waning and waxing phases—signifyon these three levels: (i) drought and rain; (ii) illness and cure; and (iii) fossiliza-tion and flux (51).Schneider goes on to suggest that the symbol is the inner link between all thatis analogous or associated, rather than the dynamic potential of each separateobject. He suggests that ‘every symbol is a rhythmic whole embracing the essen-tial, common rhythms of a series of phenomena, which are scattered over differ-ent planes by virtue of their secondary rhythms. They spread out from a spiritualcentre and their clarity and intensity decrease as they approach the periphery.The reality of the symbol is founded upon the idea that the ultimate reality of anobject lies in its spiritual rhythm—which it incarnates—and not in its materialaspect’ (50), or its functional aspect. Diel shares this view, applying it to myths,such as that of Demeter and her daughter Persephone, where he points out thatthe Eleusinian Mysteries imply three levels of meaning: the agrarian, the psycho-logical and the metaphysical, the mystery lying in the integration of these threelevels of reality; and these three levels correspond to the levels of all forms ofsense-perception and knowledge. Hence, interpretation becomes the selection ofone level as predominant, leaving aside the question of interaction, symbolicdegradation and over-restriction within the particular. It is quite legitimate to seeMedusa as a cloud, Chrysaor the golden sword as lightning, the galloping hoofbeats of Pegasus as the thunder. But by limiting the upwards-tending dynamismof the symbol within these meteorological concepts, the unbounded potentialsignificance of the symbol becomes confined within the limits of allegory."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"LEVELS OF MEANINGlFrom the Freudian school onwards, the level of a great many symbolic inter-pretations has been that of sexual activity. The swan, for example, has come to beseen simply as a symbol of hermaphroditism; yet on the mystical plane it hasalways alluded to the androgynous god of many primitive and astrobiologicalreligions, as well as to the rebis of the alchemists and to the bisexual Man of Plato.Confining the symbol in this way within the narrow limits of allegory, restrictingit to a lower plane in the pattern of the universe, is known in symbology as the‘degradation of the symbol’. And this degraded meaning may not only affect theinterpretation it receives, but also the symbol itself. At times, degradation isbrought about by trivial vulgarization: thus, arising from the myth of Mercuryand Perseus flying through space with the aid of their winged sandals, we have themore modest journeyings of those who wear the seven-league boots (38); out ofthe myth of the ‘Islands of the Blessed’, which, is connected with the mystical‘centre’, there has arisen the urge for ‘ocean paradises’ which even Gauguinsought to turn into reality; out of the mythical battles between Osiris and Set, andOrmuzd and Ahriman, come the struggles between the ‘good’ and the ‘bad’ inliterature (17). Lévy-Bruhl, in L’Expérience mystique et les symboles chez lesprimitifs, adduces some similar examples of fairy-story deformation of the sym-bol. Other forms of degradation are: over-particularized interpretation, leading tolengthy and arbitrary descriptions of ‘the language of flowers’ and so on. Over-intellectualized, allegorical interpretations are another aspect of the same thing—for example, asserting that ‘the union of Leda and the swan signifies the pairing ofPower and Injustice’; similarly, ‘identifications’ through so-called analogy. Thisdangerous tendency is what led to the decadence of symbolist movements duringthe Renaissance. In all the examples of deformation we have given, one finds thesame basic falsification: the creative drive of the symbol—its tendency to revertto its Origin—is restricted, and it is made to bear labels which are over-concrete,too materialized or inferior. Its metaphysical function is arrested, and conse-quently a single plane of reality comes to be mistaken for the sum of all possiblelevels of symbolic meaning. If this use of symbols is recognized as deformation,then—as we suggested earlier when commenting upon Caro Baroja—a generaldistrust of ready-made symbolic meanings and the attempt to use them to explainmyth, would seem to be justified. The influence of the symbol must be allowed topervade all levels of reality; only then can it be seen in all its spiritual grandeur andfecundity."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLIZING AGENTliTHE SYMBOLIZING AGENT AND THE SYMBOLIC OBJECTIn accordance with our usual practice of using the comparative rather than thedeductive method and avoiding over-classification, we have not drawn rigid divid-ing-lines between the separate meanings of each particular symbol on its variouslevels of reality. We have not done so because our sources have been very variedand we have preferred to reproduce their content with a minimum of editorialcomment. Another reason for not stating clear-cut conclusions is that in ouropinion it is not always possible to accept the particular views of some writers,however estimable they may be as compilers or even as interpreters of symbols.For example, Loeffler says that in oriental and Nordic mythology, each symbol,myth or legend contains ‘four superimposed moral lessons: (i) an historical les-son, that is, an epic narration dealing with real facts and people and serving as akind of “material backing” for the symbolic teaching involved; (ii) a psychologicallesson, depicting the struggle between spirit and matter on the human plane; (iii)a lesson bearing upon life on our planet; and (iv) a lesson upon the constitution ofmatter and cosmic order’ (38). This schematic division is surely misleading, forwe must remember that, for any given level of meaning, it is not the meaning itselfwhich changes but the way it is adapted or applied. Finally, we have not favouredthis kind of classification—despite its serial ‘multivalency’—for the reason thatsymbols, traditionally at least, seem to have an inborn tendency to settle uponone particular plane. Thus, some symbols are primarily concerned with psychol-ogy, others with the cosmological or natural orders. There are those too, we mustpoint out, which exist in order to reconcile different levels of reality, particularlythe psychic with the spatial. The best example of this is that of the mandala, andall those symbols of conjunction or those uniting the three worlds. Thus, forexample, steps are symbolic of the connexion between the conscious and theunconscious, just as they are a connexion between the upper, the terrestrial andthe nether worlds. The idea of order is an essential one in symbolism and isexpressed through the ordering of space, geometric forms, and numbers, and bythe disposition of living beings as symbols in positions determined by the law ofcorrespondences. Another essential idea of symbolist doctrine is that of thecycle, either as a series of possibles—expressed particularly through the septenaryand all its associated or derived symbolic forms—or as a process which closes upsome of the possibilities once the cycle is completed. Zodiacal symbolism is aperfect illustration of this cosmic structure. The relation of destiny with thecyclic process is implied in the figures of the legendary Tarot pack; the wealth of"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"SYMBOLIC SYNTAXliisymbolic knowledge which is contained in each and every one of its cards is notto be despised, even if their symbolic significance is open to debate.

Thestruggle to come to grips with truth and the spiritual centre appears in the form ofbattles and trials of strength, while those instincts which shackle Man and holdhim down appear as monsters. According to Diel, ‘the symbols most typical ofthe spirit and of intuition are the sun and the sunlit sky; those of the imaginationand the darker side of the unconscious, are the moon and night. The sea symbol-izes the mysterious immensity from which everything comes and to which ev-erything returns’ (15). All natural and cultural objects may be invested with asymbolic function which emphasizes their essential qualities in such a way thatthey lend themselves to spiritual interpretation. So, for example, rocks, moun-tains and all topographical features; trees and vegetables, flowers and fruit, ani-mals, works of architecture and the utilities, the members of the body and the fourelements. But it should be remembered that this catalogue of objects becomesmuch shorter when the objects become possessed of certain symbolic potentials,when they are strung together, as it were, along one line of meaning. For example,within the symbolism of levels and of the relation between heaven and earth, themountain, the tree, the temple and steps can often be equated. On occasions, sucha relationship appears to be created by or at least to bear the imprint of oneprincipal symbol. It is for this reason that Mircea Eliade can say that ‘the intui-tive awareness of the moon as the source of rhythm as well as the source ofenergy, life and regeneration (of material things) has built up a veritable networkbetween all the different cosmic planes, creating symmetries, analogies and com-munion between phenomena of infinite variety. . . . We have, for example, theseries: Moon, rain, fertility, woman, snake, death, periodic regeneration; but attimes only a part of the series is apparent: Snake, woman, fecundity; snake, rain,fecundity; or woman, snake, eroticism, etc. A complete mythology has been builtup around these smaller, secondary groups’ (17), especially around the principalsymbol.The symbolic object appears as a quality or a higher form, and also as anessence justifying and explaining the existence of the symbolizing agent. The"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"SYMBOLIC SYNTAXliiimost straightforward of symbological analyses based upon simple enumerationof the qualitative meanings of the object, sometimes, while the ‘mode of exist-ence’ is being investigated, will reveal a sudden opening which illuminates itsmeaning through an association of ideas. This association should never be thoughtof as a mere external idea in the mind of the investigator, outside the symbol itself,but rather as a revelation of the inner link—the ‘common rhythm’—joining tworealities to the mutual benefit of both. For this reason, when one reads in Picinelli’swork: ‘Sapphire:—Arouses pity. In colour similar to the sky: it shares its colour.It gladdens the heart. A symbol of heavenly reward. Contemplative’, then onemust agree that, within the limits of his implicit analysis, the writer is right as faras he goes, although the terms implying anticipation (‘arouses pity’) and moraleffect (‘it gladdens the heart’), are not strictly explanations of the symbol but ofa reaction arising from its contemplation.SYMBOLIC SYNTAXSymbols, in whatever form they may appear, are not usually isolated; theyappear in clusters, giving rise to symbolic compositions which may be evolved intime (as in the case of story-telling), in space (works of art, emblems, graphicdesigns), or in both space and time (dreams, drama). It is necessary to recall that,in symbolism, each detail invariably has some particular meaning (4), and that theway a symbol is oriented also calls for attention: for example, fire pointingdownwards represents erotic life; while, pointing towards the sky, it expressespurification. Schneider mentions also the importance of the location of the object:a basket changes its meaning when placed on the head, for ‘any given objectchanges in significance according to the “common rhythm” it is made to respondto’ (50). Combinations of symbols evidence a cumulative meaning. Thus, a crownedsnake signifies the crowning of instinctive or telluric forces. Emblems are veryoften based upon a conjunction of various simple symbols in any given sphere.At times they are concordant symbols, at times discordant. An example of theformer is the frequent mediaeval emblem of the heart enclosed within a circle fromwhich tongues of flame radiate. The three constituent parts of this emblem referto the Trinity: the heart represents Love and the mystic centre, the circle repre-sents eternity and the flames, irradiation and purification. On other occasions thesymbol is formally simple yet structurally it is made up from two or moresources: thus, the tree is given the form of a cross, or the cross the form of aleafless tree—a symbol which also occurs in mediaeval emblematic designs. An"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"SYMBOLIC SYNTAXlivexample cited by Bachelard falls within this class of confederate symbol: appear-ing in a dream of Jean-Paul are ‘white swans with wings outspread like arms’ (2).This kind of symbolic syntax is found most frequently in allegories and at-tributes. If the globe, the symbol of the world, has an eagle above it (8), itexpresses the consecration of power. Medusa’s head—with its negative, destruc-tive character—placed in the centre of a symbolic space, signifies destructiveness(15). Very important, too, is the vertical positioning of the symbol. Higher eleva-tion along a given vertical axis always indicates spiritual superiority—by analogyof physical with metaphysical ‘height’. For this reason, the uraeus of Egyptiansovereigns expressed the spiritualization of the inner force (symbolized by thesnake) when it was positioned on the forehead, on a spot the importance of whichis well known to Tantrist Yoga.Symbolic syntax, in respect of the relationship between its individual ele-ments, may function in four different ways: (a) the successive manner, onesymbol being placed alongside another; their meanings, however, do not combineand are not even interrelated; (b) the progressive manner, in which the meaningsof the symbols do not interact but represent different stages in the symbolicprocess; (c) the composite manner, in which the proximity of the symbols bringsabout change and creates complex meanings: a synthesis, that is, and not merelya mixture of their meanings; (d) the dramatic manner, in which there is an interac-tion between the groups and all the potentialities of the preceding groups aresynthesized. We have followed the practice of Enel—who would appear to havesettled the problems which preoccupied, Horapollo and Athanasius Kircher—and taken several examples from the Egyptian system of hieroglyphics, whichwell illustrates the last group. Further ideas upon the ‘de-ciphering’ of complexsymbols can be drawn from what we have suggested when dealing with spatialand pictorial symbolism. Moreover, we note that the meaning of any symbol canbe enriched by the application of the law of correspondences and its corollaries.In other words, objects possessing ‘common rhythm’ barter some of their prop-erties. But we must also recall that the Scylla and Charybdis of symbolism are(firstly) devitalization through allegorical over-simplification, and (secondly)ambiguity arising from exaggeration of either its meaning or its ultimate implica-tions; for in truth, its deepest meaning is unequivocal since, in the infinite, theapparent diversity of meaning merges into Oneness.If we take all the possible applications of an analytical method founded uponthe symbolism of space or of lineal direction, or of determinate or indeterminate,regular or irregular forms, or of the gamut of texture and colour, we can see thatthey are indeed very numerous; one in particular is the comprehension of those"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"SYMBOLIC SYNTAXlvworks of art which portray the immediate projection of inner forces and fantasiesnot in the figurative world but in the material. It could here be objected thatabstract—geometric, biomorphic or textural—painting, or surrealist visions, donot call for conscious discrimination, since the aim of the creator—as RichardWagner said of his music—is to forget all about the psychological mechanism andlet the unconscious speak to the unconscious. This is as true as it is to note thatthe implications of symbology are sometimes disturbing and even sinister. Forthis reason, and others already mentioned, we have not given analytical descrip-tions of paintings, dreams or literature. This is not the place to discuss theimplications of symbolist theory; anyone who wishes is free to make use of themystic bonds to which we allude or to ignore them as he sees fit. We only wish toadd that we regard our work less as a reference-book than a book to be read atleisure. And that only by seeing all the symbols compiled as a whole can thereader learn anything about any one of them; for symbolic meanings are oftensurprising, such as that implied in the relationship between the retiarius andmirmillo gladiators and the zodiacal signs of Pisces (aquatic forces of dissolution,its attributes being the net and the trident) and Cancer (the solar force, its at-tributes being fire, the shell of the crab and the sword)—a relationship whichexplains and justifies the gladiators’ unceasing struggle in the gilded amphitheatresof Rome. Then again, dynamism plays an important rôle. The sun, for example,may rule over or be ruled by the moon. In the latter case, we are faced with the lawof becoming; in the former, with the law of being, as defined by Evola.

To feel abandoned is, essentially, to feel forsaken bythe ‘god within us’, that is, to lose sight of the eternal light in the human spirit.This imparts to the individual’s existence a sense of estrangement—to which thelabyrinth theme is also related.Ablution To quote Oswald Wirth: ‘In alchemy, the subject, having under-gone nigredo (blackness) followed by death and putrefaction, is subjected toablution, an operation which makes use of the slow dripping of condensationfrom the vapours that rise from the carcass when a moderate flame appliedexternally is alternately raised and lowered in intensity. These continual dropsserve to bring about the progressive washing of the material, which changes fromblack to grey and then gradually to white. The whiteness is an indication of thesuccess of the first part of the Magnum Opus. The adept worker achieves thisonly by purifying his soul of all that commonly agitates it’ (59). Washing, then,symbolizes the purification not so much of objective and external evil as ofsubjective and inner evils, which we might call ‘private’. It is hardly necessary toadd that the latter kind of purification is much more difficult and painful than theformer, since what it sets out to destroy is something which is bonded to exist-ence itself with all its vital urges. The principle involved in this alchemic processis that implied in the maxim ‘Deny thyself . . .’, and an indispensable precept fortrue moral progress.Abnormality In primitive cultures, maimed beings, as well as madmen, werebelieved to possess supernatural powers—the shamans, for example. In primi-tive magico-religious thinking, the outstanding ability of physically abnormalindividuals is not regarded, as it is in modern psychology, as having been devel-oped in compensation for the abnormality, but rather the other way round: themaiming, the abnormality, the tragic destiny were the price the individual had topay for some inborn extraordinary gift—often the gift of prophecy. This beliefwas universal (9). In some mythologies, maimed beings are connected with the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"ABRACADABRA2moon and its phases; there are mythic lunar beings, with only one hand or onefoot, who have the magic power to cure disease, bring rain, and so on (17). Thisconception of abnormality is not restricted to animate beings, but applies equallyto objects. According to Cola Alberich, abnormal objects have always been con-sidered as particularly useful in warding off malignant influences. Such objectsare: stones with embedded fossils; amulets shaped like a six-fingered or a four-fingered hand; double almonds in one shell; unusually shaped grains of corn, etc.(12). There is an interesting parallel to be drawn between the spontaneous inter-est evinced by Primitive Man in strange or abnormal objects, and the more delib-erate, ‘poetic’ treatment bestowed by surrealists upon such objects as elementsin the symbolic process. The belief in the magic powers of abnormal objects isconnected with the symbolism of the jester (that is, the inverted king, the sacrifi-cial victim) and with the symbolism of the moon.Abracadabra Many words and phrases relating to rituals, talismans andpentacles have a symbolic meaning, either in themselves or in the way they areused, which is expressed either phonetically or, more frequently, graphically.This word was in frequent use during the Middle Ages as a magic formula. It isderived from the Hebrew phrase abreq ad hâbra, meaning ‘hurl your thunderbolteven unto death’. It was usually inscribed inside an inverted triangle, or was setout so that it formed a triangle (39) thus:This magic word has also been related to the Abracax (Abraxas, Abrasax) of theGnostics. It is in reality one of the names of the sun-god, Mithras (4).Abyss The abyss in any form has a fascinating dual significance. On the onehand, it is a symbol of depth in general; on the other, a symbol of inferiority. Theattraction of the abyss lies in the fact that these two aspects are inextricablylinked together. Most ancient or primitive peoples have at one time or anotheridentified certain breaks in the earth’s surface or marine depths with the abyss.Among the Celts and other peoples, the abyss was inside mountains; in Ireland,"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"3ACTIVITYJapan and the South Sea islands, it was at the bottom of seas and lakes; amongMediterranean peoples it was just beyond the horizon; for the Australian aborigi-nes, the Milky Way is the abyss par excellence. The abyss is usually identifiedwith the ‘land of the dead’, the underworld, and is hence, though not always,associated with the Great Mother and earth-god cults (35). The association be-tween the nether world and the bottom of seas or lakes explains many aspects oflegends in which palaces or beings emerge from an abyss of water. After KingArthur’s death, his sword, thrown into the lake by his command, is caught as itfalls and, before being drawn down to the bottom, flourished by a hand whichemerges from the waters.Acacia This shrub, which bears white or pink blooms, was considered sacredby the Egyptians, partly, no doubt, because of its dual coloration and also be-cause of the great mystic importance of the white-red principle (8). In Hermeticdoctrine, according to Gérard de Nerval in his Voyage en Orient (9), it symbolizesthe testament of Hiram which teaches that ‘one must know how to die in order tolive again in eternity’. It occurs with this particular symbolic meaning (that is, thesoul and immortality) in Christian art, especially the Romanesque (20).Acanthus The acanthus leaf, a very common ornamental motif in architec-ture, was, during the Middle Ages, invested with a definite symbolism derivedfrom its two essential characteristics: its growth, and its thorns. The latter is asymbol of solicitude about lowly things. According to Bishop Melito of Sardis,they signify the awareness and the pain of sin. We may mention here that in theDiary of Weininger, there is no difference between guilt and punishment. A moregeneralized symbolism, alluding perhaps to natural life itself, with its tendencytowards regression or at least towards stunting, appears in the Gospels in theparable of the sower (Luke viii, 7), where we read that some of the seed (ofspiritual principles and of salvation) fell amongst thorns and was choked. And inthe Old Testament (Genesis iii, 18) the Lord tells man that the earth will yield tohim thorns and thistles (46).Acrobat Because of his acrobatics, which often involve reversing the normalposition of the human body by standing on his hands, the acrobat is a livingsymbol of inversion or reversal, that is to say, of that need which always arises intime of crisis (personal, social or collective historical crises) to upset and reversethe established order: idealism turns into materialism; meekness into aggressive-ness; serenity into tragedy; order into disorder, or vice versa. Acrobats are relatedto other aspects of the circus and, in particular, to the mystery of the HangedMan in the Tarot pack, which has a similar significance.Activity In the mystic sense, there is no activity other than spiritual move-ment towards evolution and salvation; any other form of activity is merely agita-"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"ADAM4tion and not true activity. On this point, the West is in full accord with the East,for, according to the doctrine of Yoga, the highest state (sattva), characterized byoutward calm, is that of greatest activity (the active subjugation of the lowerimpulses and their subsequent sublimation). Thus, it is not surprising that CesareRipa, in his Iconologia, through a process of assimilation with the exalted imagesof the Archangel St. Michael and of St. George, represents ‘Virtuous Action’ as awarrior armed in a gilt cuirass, holding a book in one hand and in the other a lancepoised ready to be thrust into the head of a huge serpent which he has justvanquished. The head of Vice, crushed under his left foot, completes the allegory.Hence, every struggle or victory on the material plane has its counterpart in therealm of the spirit. Thus, according to Islamic tradition, the ‘Holy War’ (thestruggle against the infidel, depicted with weapons held at the ready) is simply animage of the ‘Great Holy War’ (the struggle of the faithful against the Powers ofEvil).Adam Primordial Man. The name is derived from the Hebrew adama ( =earth). G. G. Scholem, in On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism (London, 1965),states that, initially, Adam is conceived as ‘a vast representation of the power ofthe universe’, which is concentrated in him. Hence the equation macrocosm =microcosm. In both the Bible and the platonic doctrine of the androgyne, Eveappears as an excision of the first being, which integrated sexual duality. Do thetree and the serpent reproduce the same duality on another symbolic plane? Ordo they express a different duality to that contained in the first human couple,which is the symbol of the internal and external excision of the living being? Eve,in the rôle of persuader, appears as a mediator between the serpent (the source ofevil, which William Blake likened to energy) and man, who would have been freeand indifferent, and who would have ‘fallen’ only under pressure.Aerolite A symbol of spiritual life which has descended upon earth. Asymbol of revelation; of the ‘other world’ made accessible; and of the heavenlyfire in its creative aspect, i.e. as seed. Tradition has it that, just as there are ‘upperwaters’, there is also ‘upper fire’. The stars symbolize the unattainable aspect ofthis fire; aerolites and meteorites are its messengers, and hence they are some-times associated with angels and other heavenly hierarchies (37). It must beremembered that the iron first used by man was meteoric (which may account forthe common root of the word sidereal and other words beginning with the prefixsidero-).

The lunar ‘model’ of the four phases (of waxing, fullness,waning and disappearance) has sometimes been reduced to two or three phases,and sometimes increased to five. The phases in the span of human life haveundergone similar fluctuations, but in general they are four, with death eitheromitted or combined with the final phase of old age. The division into fourparts—quite apart from the importance of its relationship with the four phasesof the moon—coincides with the solar process and the annual cycle of the sea-sons as well as with the spatial arrangement of the four points of the compass onthe conceptual plane. The cosmic ages have been applied to the era of humanexistence, and also to the life of a race or an empire. In Hindu tradition, theManvantara, also called Mahâ-Yuga (or the Great Cycle), comprises four yuga orsecondary periods, which were said to be the same as the four ages in Greco-Roman antiquity. In India, these same ages are called after four throws in the gameof dice: krita, tretâ, dvâpara and kali. In classical times, the ages are associatedwith the symbolism of metals, giving the ‘golden age’, ‘silver age’, ‘bronze age’and ‘iron age’. The same symbolic pattern—which in itself is an interpretation—is found in the famous dream of Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel ii) as well as in the figureof the ‘Old Man of Crete’ in Dante’s Commedia (Inferno, XIV, ll. 94-120) (60,27). Progress from the purest metal to the most malleable—from gold to iron—implies involution. For this reason René Guénon comments that the successiveages, as they ‘moved away from the Beginning’, have brought about a gradualmaterialization (28). And for this reason, too, William Blake observed that ‘Progressis the punishment of God’. So that progress in life—in an individual’s existence—is tantamount to gradual surrender of the golden values of childhood, up to thepoint in which the process of growing old is terminated by death. The mythsconcerning the ‘Golden Age’ find their origin, according to Jung, in an analogywith childhood—that period when nature heaps gifts upon the child without anyeffort on his part, for he gets all he wants. But in addition, and in a deeper sense,the Golden Age stands for life in unconsciousness, for unawareness of death andof all the problems of existence, for the ‘Centre’ which precedes time, or which,within the limitations of existence, seems to bear the closest resemblance toparadise. Ignorance of the world of existence creates a kind of golden haze, butwith the growing understanding of concepts of duty, the father-principle andrational thinking, the world can again be apprehended (31).

Sometimes, the allegorical figure carries a cornuco-pia full of fruits and flowers, or has both hands leaning on a spade or a hoe. TheZodiac is also included, to indicate the importance of the yearly cycle and thesequence of the seasons and the work that each season implies (8).Air Of the four Elements, air and fire are regarded as active and male; waterand earth as passive and female. In some elemental cosmogonies, fire is givenpride of place and considered the origin of all things, but the more general belief isthat air is the primary element. Compression or concentration of air creates heator fire, from which all forms of life are then derived. Air is essentially related tothree sets of ideas: the creative breath of life, and, hence, speech; the stormywind, connected in many mythologies with the idea of creation; and, finally,space as a medium for movement and for the emergence of life-processes. Light,flight, lightness, as well as scent and smell, are all related to the general symbolismof air (3). Gaston Bachelard says that for one of its eminent worshippers,Nietzsche, air was a kind of higher, subtler matter, the very stuff of humanfreedom. And he adds that the distinguishing characteristic of aerial nature is thatit is based on the dynamics of dematerialization. Thoughts, feelings and memoriesconcerning heat and cold, dryness and humidity and, in general, all aspects ofclimate and atmosphere, are also closely related to the concept of air. According toNietzsche, air should be cold and aggressive like the air of mountain tops. Bachelardrelates scent to memory, and by way of example points to Shelley’s characteristiclingering over reminiscences of smell.Alchemy The real beginnings of alchemy date back to the first centuriesA.D., when it was practised mainly by Greeks and Arabs. Elements fromvarious traditions, including Christian mysticism, were later incorporated. Itwas essentially a symbolic process involving the endeavour to make gold,regarded as the symbol of illumination and salvation. The four stages of theprocess were signified by different colours, as follows: black (guilt, origin,latent forces) for ‘prime matter’ (a symbol of the soul in its original condition);white (minor work, first transmutation, quicksilver); red (sulphur, passion);and, finally, gold. Piobb analyses the symbolic meaning of the various opera-tions. The first, known as calcination, stood for the ‘death of the profane’, i.e.the extinction of all interest in life and in the manifest world; the second,putrefaction, was a consequence of the first, consisting of the separation ofthe destroyed remains; solution, the third, denoted the purification of matter;"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"ALCHEMY7Athanor, the alchemists’ oven (after an old engraving)"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"ALCOHOL8distillation, the fourth, was the ‘rain’ of purified matter, i.e. of the elements ofsalvation isolated by the preceding operations; fifthly, conjunction symbolizedthe joining of opposites (the coincidentia oppositorum, identified by Jung withthe close union, in Man, of the male principle of consciousness with the femaleprinciple of the unconscious); sublimation, the sixth stage, symbolized the suf-fering resulting from the mystic detachment from the world and the dedication tospiritual striving. In emblematic designs, this stage is depicted by a winglesscreature borne away by a winged being, or sometimes it is represented by thePrometheus myth. The final stage is philosophic congelation, i.e. the bindingtogether inseparably of the fixed and the volatile principles (the male/invariablewith the female/’saved’ variable). Alchemical evolution is epitomized, then, in theformula Solve et Coagula (that is to say: ‘analyse all the elements in yourself,dissolve all that is inferior in you, even though you may break in doing so; then,with the strength acquired from the preceding operation, congeal’) (48). In addi-tion to this specific symbolism, alchemy may be seen as the pattern of all otherwork. It shows that virtues are exercised in every kind of activity, even thehumblest, and that the soul is strengthened, and the individual develops. Evola(Tradizione Ermetica) writes: ‘Our Work is the conversion and change of onebeing into another being, one thing into another thing, weakness into strength,bodily into spiritual nature. . . .’ On the subject of the hermaphrodite, Eugeniod’Ors (Introducción a la vida angélica) writes: ‘That which failed to “becometwo in one flesh” (love) will succeed in “becoming two in one spirit” (individua-tion).’Alcohol Alcohol, or life-water (aqua vitae) is fire-water, i.e. a symbol of thecoincidentia oppositorum, the conjunction of opposites, where two principles,one of them active, the other passive, come together in a fluid and shifting,creative/destructive relationship. Particularly when burning, alcohol symbolizesone of the great mysteries of Nature; Bachelard aptly says that, when alcoholburns, ‘it seems as if the “female” water, losing all shame, frenziedly gives herselfto her master, fire’ (1, 2).Almond Tree Traditionally, a symbol of sweetness and delicacy. As it is oneof the first trees to blossom, late frosts can destroy its flowers. The preciseobservation of Nature, constantly practised by primitive man, is the source ofthis symbolic analogy, as of so many others which might at first seem merelyartificial allegories.Alpha and Omega The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, standing,therefore, for the beginning and end of all things. They are very frequently used inthis sense in Romanesque art. Because of its shape, alpha is related to the pair ofcompasses, an attribute of god the creator; while omega is similar to a torch, i.e. tothe fire of apocalyptic destruction. Animal figures have also been associated with"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"ANGEL9this symbolism. In the frontispiece of a 12th-century manuscript of Paulus Orosius(Bibl. Laon, 137) alpha and omega appear respectively as a bird and a fish, i.e. theupper and the lower abyss.Amphisbaena A fabulous animal, keeper of the ‘Great Secret’, according toa 16th-century Italian manuscript which belonged to Count Pierre V. Piobb. It isa symbol which occurs with some frequency in heraldic images, marks and signs.It was known to the Greeks, and it owes its name to the belief that, having a headat both ends, it could move forward or backward with equal ease. Sometimes it isdepicted with the claws of a bird and the pointed wings of a bat (48). Accordingto Diel (15), it was probably intended to express the horror and anguish associ-ated with ambivalent situations. Like all fabulous animals, it instances the abilityof the human mind to reorder aspects of the real world, according to supra-logicallaws, blending them into patterns expressive of man’s motivating psychic forces.Anchor In the emblems, signs and graphic representations of the earlyChristians, the anchor always signified salvation and hope. It was often shownupside down, with a star, cross or crescent to denote its mystic nature. TheEpistle to the Hebrews says: ‘Which hope we have as the anchor of our soul’ (4).Angel A symbol of invisible forces, of the powers ascending and descendingbetween the Source-of-Life and the world of phenomena (50). Here, as in othercases (such as the Cross), the symbolic fact does not modify the real fact. Inalchemy, the angel symbolizes sublimation, i.e. the ascension of a volatile (spiri-tual) principle, as in the figures of the Viatorium spagyricum. The parallelismbetween angelic orders and astral worlds has been traced with singular precisionby Rudolf Steiner in Les Hiérarchies spirituelles, following the treatise on thecelestial hierarchies by the Pseudo-Dionysius. From the earliest days of culture,angels figure in artistic iconography, and by the 4th millennium B.C. little or nodistinction is made between angels and winged deities. Gothic art, in many re-markable images, expresses the protective and sublime aspects of the angel-figure, while the Romanesque tends rather to stress its other-worldly nature.Anchor of Salvation, anearly Christian symbol."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"ANIMALS10Animals Of the utmost importance in symbolism, both in connexion withtheir distinguishing features, their movement, shapes and colours, and because oftheir relationship with man. The origins of animal symbolism are closely linkedwith totemism and animal worship. The symbolism of any given animal variesaccording to its position in the symbolic pattern, and to the attitude and contextin which it is depicted. Thus the frequent symbol of the ‘tamed animal’ cansignify the reversal of those symbolic meanings associated with the same animalwhen wild. In the struggle between a knight and a wild or fabulous animal—one ofthe most frequent themes in symbolism—the knight’s victory can consist eitherin the death or in the taming of the animal. In Chrétien de Troyes’ mediaevalromance, Yvain, the hero is assisted by a lion. In the legend of St. George, theconquered dragon serves its conqueror. In the West, some of the earliest refer-ences to animal symbolism are found in Aristotle and in Pliny, but the mostimportant source is the treatise Physiologus, written in Alexandria in the 2ndcentury A.D. Another important contribution was made one or two centurieslater by Horapollo, with his two treatises on Hieroglyphica, based on Egyptiansymbolism. From these sources flows a stream of mediaeval animal symbolismwhich produced such notable bestiaries as that of Philip of Thaun (A.D. 1121),Peter of Picardy and William of Normandy (13th century); or the De Animalibus,attributed to Albertus Magnus; Libre de les besties of Raymond Lull; andFournival’s Bestiaire d’Amour (14th century). The primitives’ view of animals,as analysed by Schneider (50), is mirrored in all these works, namely that whileman is an equivocal, ‘masked’ or complex being, the animal is univocal, for itspositive or negative qualities remain ever constant, thus making it possible toclassify each animal, once and for all, as belonging to a specific mode of cosmicphenomena. More generally, the different stages of animal evolution, as mani-fested by the varying degrees of biological complexity, ranging from the insect andthe reptile to the mammal, reflect the hierarchy of the instincts. In Assyrian andPersian bas-reliefs, the victory of a higher over a lower animal always stands forthe victory of the higher life over the lower instincts. A similar case is in thecharacteristic struggle of the eagle with the snake as found in pre-ColumbianAmerica. The victory of the lion over the bull usually signifies the victory of Dayover Night and, by analogy, Light triumphing over Darkness and Good over Evil.The symbolic classification of animals is often related to that of the four Ele-ments. Animals such as the duck, the frog and the fish, however much they maydiffer one from the other, are all connected with the idea of water and hence withthe concept of the ‘primal waters’; consequently, they can stand as symbols ofthe origin of things and of the powers of rebirth (37, 9). On the other hand, some"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"ANIMALS11animals, such as dragons and snakes, are sometimes assigned to water, sometimesto earth and sometimes even to fire (17). However, the most generally acceptedclassification—which is also the most fundamentally correct—associates aquaticand amphibious animals with water; reptiles with earth; birds with air; and mam-mals (because they are warm-blooded) with fire. For the purposes of symbolicart, animals are subdivided into two categories: natural (often in antitheticalpairs: toad/frog, owl/eagle, etc.) and fabulous. Within the cosmic order, the latteroccupy an intermediate position between the world of fully differentiated beingsand the world of formless matter (50). They may have been suggested by thediscovery of skeletons of antediluvian animals, and also by certain beings which,though natural, are ambiguous in appearance (carnivorous plants, sea urchins,flying fish, bats), and thus stand for flux and transformism, and also for purpose-ful evolution towards new forms. In any event, fabulous animals are powerfulinstruments of psychological projection. The most important fabulous animalsare: chimaera, sphinx, lamia, minotaur, siren, triton, hydra, unicorn, griffin, harpy,winged horse, hippogryph, dragon, etc. In some of these the transmutation is asimple one, and clearly positive in character—such as Pegasus’ wings (the spiri-tualization of a lower force)—but more often the symbol is a consequence of amore complex and ambiguous process of the imagination. The result is a range ofhighly ambivalent symbols, whose significance is heightened by the ingrainedbelief in the great powers exercised by such beings as well as in the magic impor-tance of abnormality and deformity. In addition, there are animals which, whilehardly or not at all fabulous in appearance, are credited with non-existential orsupernatural qualities as the result of a symbolic projection (for example, thepelican, phoenix, salamander). There is a fragment by Callimachus on the Age ofSaturn, in which animals have the power of speech (this being a symbol of theGolden Age which preceded the emergence of the intellect—Man—when theblind forces of Nature, not yet subject to the logos, were endowed with all sortsof extraordinary and exalted qualities). Hebrew and Islamic traditions also includereferences to ‘speaking animals’ (35). Another interesting classification is that of‘lunar animals’, embracing all those animals whose life-span includes some kindof cyclic alternation, with periodic appearances and disappearances (18). Thesymbolism of such animals includes, in addition to the animal’s specific symbolicsignificance, a whole range of lunar meanings. Schneider also mentions a verycurious primitive belief: namely, that the voice of those animals which can be saidto serve as symbols of heaven is high-pitched if the animal is large (the elephant,for example), but low-pitched if the animal is small (as the bee); while the con-verse is true of earth-symbol animals. Some animals, in particular the eagle and"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"ANIMALS12the lion, seem to embody certain qualities, such as beauty and the fighting spirit,to such an extent that they have come to be universally accepted as the allegoricalrepresentations of these qualities. The emblematic animals of Roman signa were:eagle, wolf, bull, horse and wild boar. In symbolism, whenever animals (or anyother symbolic elements) are brought together in a system, the order of arrange-ment is always highly significant, implying either hierarchical precedence or rela-tive position in space. In alchemy, the descending order of precedence is symbol-ized by different animals, thus: the phoenix (the culmination of the alchemicalopus), the unicorn, the lion (the necessary qualities), the dragon (prime matter)(32). Symbolic groups of animals are usually based on analogical and numericalpatterns: the tetramorphs of Western tradition, as found in the Bible, are a funda-mental example; another example would be the Chinese series of the four benevo-lent animals: the unicorn, phoenix, turtle and dragon. The following animals occurparticularly in Romanesque art: the peacock, ox, eagle, hare, lion, cock, crane,locust and partridge (50). Their symbolic meaning is mainly derived from theScriptures or from patristic tradition, though some meanings, arising from anal-ogy, such as that between cruelty and the leopard, are immediately obvious (20).The importance in Christianity of the symbols of the dove, the lamb and the fishis well known. The significance of the attitudes in which symbolic animals aredepicted is usually self-evident: the counterbalancing of two identical—or twodifferent— animals, so common in heraldry, stands for balance (i.e. justice andorder, as symbolized for instance by the two snakes of the caduceus); the animalsare usually shown supporting a shield or surmounting the crest of a helmet. Jungsupports this interpretation with his observation that the counterbalancing of thelion and the unicorn in Britain’s coat of arms stands for the inner stress ofbalanced opposites finding their equilibrium in the centre (32). In alchemy, thecounterbalancing of the male and the female of the same species (lion/lioness, dog/bitch) signifies the essential contrast between sulphur and mercury, the fixed andthe volatile elements. This is also the case when a winged animal is opposed to awingless one. The ancient interest in animals as vehicles of cosmic meanings, overand above the mere fact of their physical existence, persisted from the earliestbeginnings of the Neolithic Age up to as late as 1767, with the publication of suchworks as Jubile van den Heyligen Macarius. This treatise describes processionsin which each symbolic chariot has a characteristic animal (the peacock, phoenix,pelican, unicorn, lion, eagle, stag, ostrich, dragon, crocodile, wild boar, goat, swan,winged horse, rhinoceros, tiger and elephant). These same animals, together withmany others (such as the duck, donkey, ox, owl, horse, camel, ram, pig, deer,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"ANJANA13stork, cat, griffin, ibis, leopard, wolf, fly, bear, bird, dove, panther, fish,-snakeand fox) are those mainly used also as watermarks in papermaking. The use ofwatermarks, undoubtedly mystical and symbolic in origin, spread throughout theWestern world from the end of the 13th century onwards. All the above particularsymbolic uses rest on a general symbolism of animals, in which they are related tothree main ideas: the animal as a mount (i.e. as a means of transport); as an objectof sacrifice; and as an inferior form of life (4). The appearance of animals indreams or visions, as in Fuseli’s famous painting, expresses an energy still undif-ferentiated and not yet rationalized, nor yet mastered by the will (in the sense ofthat which controls the instincts) (31). According to Jung, the animal stands forthe non-human psyche, for the world of subhuman instincts, and for the uncon-scious areas of the psyche. The more primitive the animal, the deeper the stratumof which it is an expression. As in all symbolism, the greater the number of objectsdepicted, the baser and the more primitive is the meaning (56). Identifying oneselfwith animals represents integration of the unconscious and sometimes—like im-mersion in the primal waters—rejuvenation through bathing in the sources of lifeitself (32). It is obvious that, for pre-Christian man (as well as in amoral cults),the animal signifies exaltation rather than opposition. This is clearly seen in theRoman signa, showing eagles and wolves symbolically placed on cubes (theearth) and spheres (heaven, the universe) in order to express the triumphantpower of the force of an instinct. With regard to mythic animals, a more extensivetreatment of this subject is to be found in the Manual de zoología fantástica ofBorges y Guerrero (Mexico and Buenos Aires, 1957), in which such creatures arecharacterized as basically symbolic and, in most cases, expressive of ‘cosmicterror’.Anjana A type of witch in Hispanic folklore, the name perhaps being derivedfrom Jana or Diana. These witches take on the form of old women to test out thecharity of human beings. In their true form they are beautiful young women, fairhaired and blue-eyed, clothed in tunics made of flowers and silver stars. Theycarry a gold staff and wear green stockings. They watch over animals and haveunderground palaces full of jewels and other treasure. The touch of their staffturns everything into riches (10). Symbolism of this kind reveals ancestral memo-ries of druidesses; at a deeper level it also signifies the soul renewed by fusionwith the ‘mana personality’. The staff, a sigmoid symbol, is the emblem of thoserelationships linking apparently unrelated things. The green stockings allude tothe primitive forces of virgin nature. The treasures and riches signify the spiritualpowers harboured by the unconscious."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"ANTIQUITY14Antiquity The age of an object confers upon it an additional significancewhich eventually becomes more important than the original significance of theobject itself. The significance of antiquity is derived from the following consider-ations: (i) Whatever is old is authentic, unadulterated, true, a link with the otherworld; old things do not deceive, therefore they stand for truth itself; (ii) What-ever is old is primitive, closer to that ‘primigenial era’ which boasted the ‘GoldenAge’ of humanity; (iii) By analogy, whatever is old is related to the primitivestages in the individual’s life, i.e. to the carefree life of the child, the ‘paradise lost’of childhood.Ants An attribute of Ceres, ants were utilized in soothsaying (8). There is anIndian myth in which they symbolize the pettiness of all things living—thefragile character and impotence of existence; but they also represent the life whichis superior to human life (60). On account of their multiplicity, their symbolicsignificance is unfavourable.Anvil A symbol of the earth and of matter. It corresponds to the passive andfeminine principle, as opposed to the hammer, which denotes fecundation.Apocalyptic Beast A symbol of matter in the process of involution: a snakeor a dragon, for example, in so far as they are enemies of the spirit and a perver-sion of higher qualities (9). It has sometimes been equated with the feminineprinciple, in so far as this is a source of temptation and corruption, and particu-larly of stagnation in the process of evolution. Myths such as those of Calypsoor the sirens are related to this theme.Apollo In mythology and alchemy, his spiritual and symbolic significance isidentical with that of the sun (15). The spreading golden hairs which crown thegod’s head have the same meaning as the bow and arrow (sunrays) (8). The Greekname for Apollo is, of course, Apollon, which means ‘from the depths of the lion’and expresses the meaningful relationship of the sun with the fifth sign of theZodiac, Leo (48).Apple Being almost spherical in shape, the apple signifies totality. It issymbolic of earthly desires, or of indulgence in such desires. The warning not toeat the forbidden apple came, therefore, from the mouth of the supreme being, asa warning against the exaltation of materialistic desire (15). The intellect, thethirst for knowledge—as Nietzsche realized—is only an intermediate zone be-tween earthly desire and pure spirituality.Aquarius The eleventh archetypal sign of the Zodiac. Its allegorical repre-sentation is a figure of a man pouring water from an amphora. In the EgyptianZodiac of Denderah, Aquarius carries two amphorae. This version merely affectsthe numerical symbolism; it affords clearer proof of the dual force of the symbol"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"15ARCHITECTURE(its active and passive aspects, evolution and involution), a duality which is ofthe essence in the important symbol of the Gemini. All Eastern and Westerntraditions relate this archetype to the symbolic flood which stands not only forthe end of a formal universe but also for the completion of any cycle by thedestruction of the power which held its components together. When this powerceases to function, the components return to the Akasha—the universal sol-vent—which is symbolized by Pisces. In these two signs of the Zodiac, then, thecosmic pralaya, or Brahma’s night, runs its course. Its function, according toHindu tradition, is to reabsorb into Oneness all those elements which originallyseceded from it to lead separate individual existences. Thus, each end carries theseed of a new beginning (Ouroboros). The Egyptians identified Aquarius withtheir god Hapi, the personification of the Nile, whose floods were the source ofthe agricultural, economic and spiritual life of the country. Consequently, Aquariussymbolizes the dissolution and decomposition of the forms existing within anyprocess, cycle or period; the loosening of bonds; the imminence of liberationthrough the destruction of the world of phenomena (40, 52).Arabesque A type of ornamentation which appears to imply, apart from thecultural context of its proper name (Arabia, Islamic art), the idea of repetition, ofturning back on oneself, of intertwining. To a certain extent, this idea relates it toCelto-Germanic ornamentalism and Irish and Viking art, but with profound dif-ferences. On the other hand, the arabesque has been associated by literati with thegrotesque, because of its labyrinthine, sinuous form. There is more freedom in theNordic plaits than in the oriental arabesques, which sometimes assume a circularshape, forming a kind of mandala.Architecture The symbolism of architecture is, of course, complex andwide-ranging. It is founded upon ‘correspondences’ between various patterns ofspatial organization, consequent upon the relationships, on the abstract plane,between architectural structures and the organized pattern of space. While thebasic pattern of architectural relationships provides the primary symbolism,secondary symbolic meanings are derived from the appropriate selection of indi-vidual forms, colours and materials, and by the relative importance given to thevarious elements forming the architectural whole (function, height, etc.). Themost profound and fundamental architectural symbol is the ‘mountain-temple’Zodiacal Sign of Aquarius"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"ARCHITECTURE16(the Babylonian ziggurat, Egyptian pyramid, American teocalli or stepped pyra-mid, Buddhist stupa). It is based on a complex geometrical symbolism includingboth the pyramid and the ladder or staircase, as well as the mountain itself. Someof this symbolism can also be found in Western religious building, particularlyGothic cathedrals. Such temples often include essential elements from the mandalasymbolism (that is, the squaring of the circle, through a geometrical diagramcombining the square and the circle, usually linked through the octagon as anintermediate step) and from the symbolism of numbers (the significant figurestanding for the number of essential factors: for example, 7 is very common instepped pyramids; and, in the Temple of Heaven in Peking, 3—the number offloors—is the basic number, multiplied by itself because of the 3 platforms andthe 3 roofs) (6). The figure 8, as we have seen, is of great importance as the linkbetween 4 (or the square) and the circle. The Tower of the Winds, in Athens, wasoctagonal in plan. The eight pillars of the Temple of Heaven in Peking are anotherinstance (6). As the cave inside the mountain is an essential element in mountainsymbolism, it follows that the ‘mountain-temple’ would not be complete with-out some form of cave. In this sense, Indian rock-cut temples are a literal expres-sion of the mountain-cave symbol: the temple actually is the cave cut into the sideof the mountain. The cave stands for the spiritual Centre, the heart or the hearth(cf. the cave in Ithaca, or the Cave of the Nymphs in Porphyry). This symbolismimplies a displacement of the symbolic centre, that is, the mountain peak of theworld ‘outside’ is transferred to the ‘inside’ (of the mountain, and so of the worldand of Man). The primary belief in the fundamental significance of an externalform (such as the menhir, omphalos or pillar) is replaced by an interest in thespace at the centre of things’, identified as the ancient symbol of the ‘world egg’.One of the specific symbols of this is the dome, symbolizing also the vault ofheaven (which is why domes in ancient Persia were always painted blue or black).In this connexion, it is important to note that, in the geometrical symbolism of thecosmos, all circular forms relate to the sky or heaven, all squares to the earth, andall triangles (with the apex at the top) to fire and to the urge towards ascensioninherent in human nature. Hence, the triangle also symbolizes the communicationbetween earth (the material world) and heaven (the spiritual world). The squarecorresponds to the cross formed by the four Cardinal Points (6). And, of course,the pyramid is square in plan and triangular in section. This general symbolism,however, can be profoundly modified in certain directions by the addition ofpowerful secondary meanings or associations. Thus, whereas Christianity comesto stress the importance of the human individual rather than the cosmos, temple-symbolism emphasizes the transcendence of the human figure rather than the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"ARCHITECTURE17contrast between heaven and earth—though the primary meaning can by nomeans be ignored. Already in Greek, Etruscan and Roman temple-building, thissymbolic contrast, as well as the symbolism of gradual ascent (as in Babylonianziggurats) had become subservient to the concept of a temple mirroring on earththe division of the heavens into an ordered pattern, and resting on supports(pillars, columns) which—since they originate from primitive lake-dwelling struc-tures—relate the earth’s surface to the ‘primordial waters’ of the ocean. Thetypical Romanesque church combines the symbolisms of the dome, and of thecircle and the square, with two new elements of the greatest importance: thesubdivision of the main body of the building into nave and two aisles (symbolicof the Trinity) and the cross-shaped plan, derived from the image of a man lyingprostrate with his arms outstretched whereby the centre becomes not man’snavel (a merely symmetrical division) but his heart (at the intersection of naveand transept), while the main apse represents the head. As indicated above, eacharchitectural element contributes to the general symbolism. Thus, in Gothic ar-chitecture, the symbol of the Trinity occurs repeatedly in triple doors, trefoiled,scalloped and pointed arches. The ogive in itself is nothing but a triangle withcurved sides, with all the specific implications of triangle-symbolism outlinedabove (14, 46). The flammigerous arch, as the name indicates, is a symbol of fire,and it would be possible to see in the formal evolution of 15th-century Gothic areturn to the apocalyptic meanings which were so important in Romanesqueiconography (46). Jambs, pillars and side columns can be interpreted as ‘guard-ians’ of the doorway. Porches are the external counterpart of the altar-piecewhich, in its turn, is—as it were—the ‘programme’ set up in the heart of thetemple. Cloisters also possess cosmic and spiritual implications. On the cosmicplane, and regarded as a spatial expression of a period of time, they stand for thecycle of the year, and by analogy, for the life-span of Man. The correlation is asfollows: North-East side of the cloister—October December; North-West—Janu-ary/March; South-West—April/June; South-East—July/September. The fourdivisions of the year (or of the human life-span of which it is an analogical image)are further correlated to the four phases of a ritual cycle of healing (or salvation):the first phase—death, danger and suffering; second phase—purifying fire; third—cure; fourth—convalescence (51). According to Pinedo, the South side, whencethe warm winds blow, pertains to the Holy Spirit, inspiring the soul with the fireof charity and divine love; the North side, exposed to the cold winds, pertains tothe devil and his insinuations that freeze the soul (46). As regards one of the mostcharacteristic features of Gothic cathedrals—the twin frontal towers—Schneiderpoints out that they are related to the two peaks of the Mountain of Mars (with"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"ARIES18its related symbols of the Gemini, Janus and the number 2), while the dome overthe intersection of the nave and transepts stands for the Mountain of Jupiter (orunity). Paradise is above the platform and Hell (represented by the gargoyles)beneath. The four supports, pillars or piers which subdivide the façade anddetermine the location of the three doorways are the four rivers of Paradise. Thethree doors stand for faith, hope and charity. The central rosette is, the Lake ofLife, where heaven and earth meet (sometimes it also stands for heaven, towardswhich the apex of the triangular ogive points) (50). Attempts have also been madeto define the probable allegorical significance of other parts of the architecturalfabric of the cathedral. Thus, according to Lampérez, the church walls stand forhumanity redeemed; the counterforts and flying buttresses for uplifting, moralstrength; the roof for charity and shelter; the pillars, for the dogmas of the faith;the ribbing of the vaults, for the paths of salvation; the spires, for God’s fingerpointing to the ultimate goal of mankind. It will be seen that the special symbolicmeanings here are obviously related to the appearance and functions of the vari-ous architectural elements. Two further facts should also be mentioned: the ‘de-graded’ interpretation suggested by psychoanalysts whereby every building isseen as a human body (doors and windows— openings; pillars—forces) or spirit(cellars—subconscious; attics— mind, imagination)—an interpretation arrived aton an experimental basis; and the possibility of elaborating increasingly complexsystems by combining a number of symbolic principles. Kubler, in his BaroqueArchitecture, analyses the case of Fr. Giovanni Ricci who, following the exampleof his mannerist forerunners Giacomo Soldati and Vincenzo Scamozzi, endeav-oured to develop a new ‘harmonic’—or ideal—architectural order, by integratingthe existing systems (Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, etc.) into a scheme whereby eachdifferent mode was related to a specific temperament or to a certain degree ofholiness (Plate III).Aries The Ram, a symbol of the creative impulse and of the spirit at themoment of its inception (4). The first sign of the Zodiac. In Hindu symbolism itstands for Parabrahman, that is, for the undifferentiated whole. Because theZodiac is the symbol of the cycle of existence, Aries, its first sign, stands for theoriginal cause or the thunderbolt which emerges from the Akasha of Pisces, thatis, from the ‘primordial waters’. Aries, because it stands for the initial impulsethrough which the potential becomes actual, is also related to the dawn and toSpring, and generally to the beginning of any cycle, process or creation. In Egyptthe ram was the symbol of Amon-Ra, and the god was depicted with ram’s horns.As regards human physiology, Aries controls the head and the brain, that is to"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"ARROW19say, the organs which are the centre of the individual’s physical and spiritualenergies, as Parabrahman is the centre of the cosmic forces (40).Ark Both on the material and the spiritual planes the ark symbolizes thepower to preserve all things and to ensure their rebirth (40). Biologically speak-ing, it can be regarded as a symbol of the womb (9) or of the heart (14), there beingan obvious connexion between these two organs. The symbolism of Noah’s arkhas been the subject of much discussion beginning as early as St. Ambrose, DeNoe et Arca, and Hugh of Saint Victor, De arca Noe morali and De arca mystica.The basic symbolism of the ark is the belief that the essences of the physical andspiritual life can be extracted and contained within a minute seed until such timeas a rebirth creates the conditions necessary for the re-emergence of these es-sences into external life (14). Guénon has found subtle analogies, of great sym-bolic interest, between the ark and the rainbow. The ark, during the cosmic pralaya,floats on the waters of the lower ocean; the rainbow, in the realm of the ‘upperwaters’, is a sign of the restoration of the order which is preserved below in theark. Both figures together, being complementary, complete the circle of Oneness.They therefore correspond to the two halves of the ancient symbol of the ‘worldegg’ (28). As a symbol of the heart (or of the mind, or of thought) the image of theark is similar to that of the drinking-vessel, so frequent in mediaeval mysticism.Arm In Egyptian hieroglyphs, the sign of the arm stands for activity ingeneral. Other signs derived from this primary sign stand for special kinds ofactivity, such as working, offering, protecting, donating, etc. The hieroglyphdepicting two raised arms is a symbol of invocation and of self-defence (19), ameaning which is universally recognized. A frequent motif in heraldic and em-blematic devices is that of a weapon held by an arm emerging from a cloud, orfrom the surround of a picture. This is the avenging arm of the Lord of Hosts, ora call from the heavens for vengeance (39).Arrow The weapon of Apollo and Diana, signifying the light of supremepower (4). In both Greece (8) and pre-Columbian America (39), it was used todesignate the sun’s rays. But, because of its shape, it has undeniable phallicsignificance, specially when it is shown in emblems balanced against the symbolZodiacal sign of Aries."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"ARTHUR, KING20of the ‘mystic Centre’, feminine in character, such as the heart. The heart piercedwith an arrow is a symbol of ‘Conjunction’.Arthur, King The hero, king or penteyrn of the Silures of Caerleon in Wales.Around him are built the legends of the Round Table, the earliest known sourcesof which being the Brut (c. 1155) of the Norman, Wace, and the Historia RegumBritanniae (c. 1150) by Geoffrey of Monmouth, and the Welsh Mabinogion (orRed Book) containing the tale of Kuhlwch and Olwen (towards the end of the 9thcentury). Arthur appears to have been the son of the Breton leader, UtherPendragon, whom he succeeded in 516. He is credited with deeds of mythicdimensions. For Rhys, he is an avatar of the Gallic god Mercurius Arterius, kingof the fabled country Oberon. He is the archetype of the ‘mythical king’ whosynthesizes the hopes of a race and who reflects ‘primordial man’. Traditionrefuses to accept his death and affirms that he will reappear in the specific shapeof Arthur when the English have need of him to triumph over their enemies.Symbols closely connected with King Arthur are such as these: magic or miracu-lous swords and shields; the ‘holy war’ or the struggle between good and evil; thetwelve knights with their implied relationship with the signs of the zodiac and theidea of totality.Ascension The symbolism of ascension or ascent has two main aspects:externally a higher level in space signifies a higher value by virtue of its connexionwith the symbolism of space and height; and, secondly, it pertains to the innerlife, the symbolism of which concerns the ‘upward impulse’ rather than anyactual ascent. As Mircea Eliade has observed: ‘Whatever the religious context,and whatever the particular form they may take (shamanist or initiation rites,mystic ecstasy, dream-vision, heroic legend), ascensions of all kinds, such asclimbing mountains or stairs or soaring upwards through the air, always signifythat the human condition is being transcended and that higher cosmic levels arebeing attained. The mere fact of “levitation” is equivalent to a consecration. . . .’(17). But, according to a more straightforward interpretation based upon theconcept of energy, the action of rising (as, in music, going from bass to treble, orfrom piano to forte) expresses an increase in intensity (38), whether it concernsdomination or the lust for power, or any other urge whatsoever. All world-axissymbols (the mountain, ladder, tree, cross, liana, rope, the thread of the spider,spear) are connected with the symbolism of ascension (18).Ashlar In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, the sign incor porating theashlar (or squared stone) symbolizes material which has been worked upon, orthe results of creative activity. By analogy, it refers to the trials necessitated by"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"AXE21the spiritual evolution which Man must undergo (19) before he can attain to theessential conditions of regularity, order, coherence and continuity. The idea hereis the same as that expressed in the alchemic dialectic of the fixed and the volatileprinciples. The connexion between the ashlar and the human spirit arises from thegeneral symbolism of the stone combined with the notion of humanity as aperfect structure which ensures that every ‘saved’ man is whole and firm as rock.Ass This symbolic animal appears as an attribute of Saturn, in his capacity asthe ‘second sun’. It is always on heat, and hated by Isis (31). The significance ofthe mock crucifix, with an ass’s head, from the Palatine, must be related to theequation of Yahve with Saturn (31), although it may be that it is related to thejester-symbol. In connexion with the latter, the ass’s head, frequently found inmediaeval emblems, marks and signs, often stands for humility, patience andcourage. Sometimes there is a wheel or a solar symbol between the ass’s ears. Thissymbol, also found on the heads of oxen, always denotes that the animal is asacrificial victim (4). But the symbolism of the ass involves still further complexi-ties: Jung defines it as daemon triunus—a chthonian trinity which in Latin al-chemy was depicted as a three-headed monster, one head representing mercury,the second salt and the third sulphur, or, in short, the three material principles ofmatter (32). In Chaldaea, the goddess of death is depicted kneeling on an asswhich is being ferried across the River of Hell in a boat. In dreams, the ass,especially when it appears invested with a solemn and ritual aspect, is usually amessenger of death or appears in connexion with a death, as destroyer of a life-span.Aureole A circular or oblong halo surrounding bodies in glory. According toa 12th-century text, attributed to the abbey of St. Victor, the oblong shape derivesfrom the symbolism of the almond, which is identified with Christ. This, how-ever, does not change the general sense of the aureole (6) as a relic of solar cults,and as a fire-symbol expressive of irradiating, supernatural energy (31), or as amanifestation of the emanation of spiritual light (which plays such an importantpart in Hindu doctrine) (26). The almond-shaped aureole, which usually sur-rounds the whole of the body, is usually divided into three zones, as an activeexpression of the Trinity (6).Axe A symbol of the power of light. The battle-axe has a significance whichis equivalent to that of the sword, the hammer and the cross. But much moreimportant and complex is the significance of the twin-bladed axe, related to thesign tau (4). This double-headed axe is to be found in a host of works of art fromIndia to England, and specially in the Mediterranean countries—in Africa and"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"BABYLON22Crete. Very often it is located over the head of an ox, just between its horns, whenit comes to symbolize on the one hand the mandorla (related to horns because ofits shape), and, on the other, the function of sacrifice in the relationship betweenthe valley-symbol and the mountain-symbol (that is, between earth and heaven)(50). According to Luc Benoist, this twin-bladed axe is the same as the Hinduvajra and Jove’s thunderbolt, becoming, therefore, a symbol of celestial illumina-tion. Nowadays the double-bladed axe (the labrys) is associated with the laby-rinth, both being symbols in the Cretan cult. The labyrinth denotes the world ofexistence—the pilgrimage in quest of the ‘Centre’ (6). In some paintings in Crete,such as that on a sarcophagus from Hagia Triada, we see a symbol made up of acone, a double-bladed axe and a bird. The cone alludes to the deity; the axe, like allthings dual, is an aspect of the Gemini, that is, of the focal-point of symbolicInversion; the bird has been recognized as an image of the human soul ever sincethe time of the Egyptians (Waldemar Fenn). The axe is also symbolic of deathordered by a deity.BBabylon This is a symbol of considerable interest, even if cultural in conceptrather than spontaneous or analogical. Like Carthage, Babylon is an image of afallen and corrupt existence—the opposite of the Heavenly Jerusalem and ofParadise (37). In its esoteric sense, it symbolizes the solid or material world, inwhich the involution and evolution of the spirit takes place, or, in other words,the pervasion and desertion of matter by the spirit (37).Balder A Nordic god killed by the mistletoe, which he himself personifies.Closely connected with various other symbols, such as fire, the sun and the oak(21); he is also related to Odin and the profound symbolism of the Hanged Man(in the Tarot pack).Bandages Bandages, bands, sashes or swaddling-bands, in the Egyptiansystem of hieroglyphs, possess a double symbolism embracing both the swad-dling-clothes of the newborn babe and the winding-sheet of the corpse in thetomb. They constitute a determinative sign corresponding to the letter S (a letterwhich has subsequently been construed as a snake) (19)."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"BEE23Basilisk A fabulous animal with a snake’s body, pointed head and a three-pointed crest. In mediaeval descriptions it was said to be born of a yolkless egglaid by a cock and hatched by a toad on a bed of dung, and to have a three-pointedtail, glittering eyes and a crown on its head. Its glance was believed to be lethal, sothat it could only be destroyed while its assailant was watching it in a mirror. Thisbelief is related to the myth of the Gorgon’s head. In the East, its body wassupposed to be a mixture of cock, snake and toad. According to Diel, this pro-jected image of the human psyche is clearly infernal in character, as is shown byits threefold attributes (its three-pointed crest and trifurcated tail) since they arean inversion of the qualities of the Trinity; and also by the predominance of evilcomponents, such as the toad and the snake. It is one of the many ‘keepers oftreasure’ mentioned in legend.Basket For Jung, it stands for the maternal body (31). On Greek coins, thefigure of a basket covered with ivy represents the Bacchanalian mysteries. It issaid that Semele, while she was bearing Bacchus, was placed in a basket andthrown into the river (the symbolism of water being bound up with the idea ofbirth) (8).Bat Because of its ambiguous nature, the bat is contradictory in implication.In China, for example, it is emblematic of happiness and long life (5). In Westernalchemy it had a meaning which was not far removed from that of the dragon andthat of the hermaphrodite. Its wings, nevertheless, are an infernal attribute (32).Bath The symbolism of immersion in water derives from that of water itself,and signifies not only purification (a secondary symbolism taken from the generalconcept of water as a clear, cleansing liquid) but, more fundamentally, regenera-tion through the effect of the transitional powers (implying change, destructionand re-creation) of the ‘primordial waters’ (the fluid Element). In alchemy, thissame meaning received a specialized application: the bath symbolizes the disso-lution and also the purification of gold and silver.Battering-Ram According to Fr. Heras, a symbol of penetration, that is, ofan ambivalent force capable of either fertilizing or destroying.Bear In alchemy, the bear corresponds to the nigredo of prime matter, andhence it is related to all initial stages and to the instincts. It has consequently beenconsidered a symbol of the perilous aspect of the unconscious and as an attributeof the man who is cruel and crude. Since it is found in the company of Diana it isregarded as a lunar animal (31).Bee In Egyptian hieroglyphic language, the sign of the bee was a determina-tive in royal nomenclature, partly by analogy with the monarchic organization ofthese insects, but more especially because of the ideas of industry, creative activ-"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"BELL24ity and wealth which are associated with the production of honey (19). In theparable of Samson (Judges xiv, 8) the bee appears in this same sense. In Greece itwas emblematic of work and obedience. According to a Delphic tradition, thesecond of the temples built in Delphi had been erected by bees. In Orphic teach-ing, souls were symbolized by bees, not only because of the association withhoney but also because they migrate from the hive in swarms, since it was heldthat souls ‘swarm’ from the divine unity in a similar manner (40). In Christiansymbolism, and particularly during the Romanesque period, bees were symbolsof diligence and eloquence (20). In the Indo-Aryan and Moslem traditions theyhave the same purely spiritual significance as in Orphic teaching (50).Bell Its sound is a symbol of creative power (4). Since it is in a hangingposition, it partakes of the mystic significance of all objects which are suspendedbetween heaven and earth. It is related, by its shape, to the vault and, conse-quently, to the heavens.Belly The interior of the belly is invariably equated symbolically with thealchemic laboratory, or, in other words, with the place where transmutations areeffected. Since these metamorphoses are entirely of a natural order, the belly-laboratory becomes, in a sense, the antithesis to the brain (57).Belt The belt or girdle is a symbol of the protection of the body and, being anallegory of virginity, implies the ‘defensive’ (moral) virtues of the person. It isworth noting that the belt, together with gold spurs—doubtless sharing the samesignificance—was an attribute of the mediaeval knight. On the other hand, whenthe belt is associated with Venus, it takes on an erotic, fetishistic sense.Binary Duality is a basic quality of all natural processes in so far as theycomprise two opposite phases or aspects. When integrated within a higher con-text, this duality generates a binary system based on the counterbalanced forcesof two opposite poles. The two phases or aspects can be either symmetrical (orin other words identical in extent and intensity) or asymmetrical, successive orsimultaneous. Instances of a duality of successive phases would be phenomenasuch as: day and night; winter and summer; waxing and waning; life and death;systole and diastole; breathing in and out; youth and old age. Examples of dualitywhich can be either successive or simultaneous: wet/dry; cold/hot; male/female;positive/negative; sun/moon; gold/silver; round/square; fire/water; volatile/fixed;spiritual/corporeal; brother/sister, etc. The right hand and left hand, correspond-ing to the two pillars Jachin and Boaz in Hebrew tradition, and to the gates ofheaven and hell which the Latins associated with Janus, can be taken to symbol-ize a binary system. This is also the case with the King and Queen in alchemy(28). Whether the opposition is one of successive phases or of simultaneous"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"BINARY25movements of tension, does not affect the nature of the system, the ultimateexpression of which is found in the myth of the Gemini; in the Manichean andGnostic doctrines it takes the form of a moral duality in which evil is given anequal status with good. Evil and matter, according to Neo-Pythagorean doctrine,generate the dyas (duality), which is female in nature, and depicted in the Gnosisof Justin as a dual being, with a woman’s torso and a snake’s tail. Diel points outthat this dyas, craving vengeance and locked in combat with the Pneuma, is thearchetype of legendary figures such as Medea, Ariadne or Yseult (15). The mys-tery of duality, which is at the root of all action, is manifest in any opposition offorces, whether spatial, physical or spiritual. The primordial pairing of heavenand earth appears in most traditions as an image of primal opposition, the binaryessence of natural life (17). As Schneider has observed, the eternal duality ofNature means that no phenomenon can ever represent a complete reality, butonly one half of a reality. Each form has its analogous counterpart: man/ woman;movement/rest; evolution/involution; right/left—and total reality embraces both.A synthesis is the result of a thesis and an antithesis. And true reality resides onlyin the synthesis (50). This is why, in many individuals, there is a psychologicaltendency towards ambivalence, towards the breaking down of the unitary as-pects of things, even though it may prove to be a source of most intense suffering.Before Freud, Eliphas Lévi had already suggested that ‘Human equilibrium con-sists of two tendencies—an impulse towards death, and one towards life’. Thedeath-wish is therefore as natural and as spiritual as the life or erotic impulse. Theintegration of these symbols within complex patterns of ‘correspondences’ reachesits highest pitch of perfection in the East, where cosmic allegories (such as theWheel of Transformations, the Yang-Yin disk, the Shri-Yantra, etc.) provide amost intense, graphic expression of these notions of contradiction and synthesis.The basic elements of such antithesis are the positive principle (male, lucid,active), and, opposing it, the negative principle (female, obscure, passive); psy-chologically speaking, these correspond respectively to the conscious and uncon-scious components of the personality; and, from the point of view of Man’sdestiny, they correspond to involution and evolution (25). These symbolic fig-ures are therefore not so much an expression of the duality of the forces involved,but rather of their complementary character within the binary system. Hindudoctrine asserts that Brahma is sat and non-sat, what-is and what-is-not: satyamand asatyam (reality and non-reality). In the Upanishads this synthesis is definedin dynamic terms as ‘that which is in motion, yet nevertheless remains still’.Schneider explains these paradoxes with the suggestion that, in mystic systems,the antithesis is the complement, not the negation, of the thesis (50). It is in this"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"BIRD26sense that one should interpret the saying of Lao-Tse that ‘he who knows hismasculinity and preserves his femininity, is the abyss of the world’ (58). Never-theless, the tendency of opposites to unite in a synthesis is always characterizedby stress and suffering, until and unless it is finally resolved by supernaturalmeans. Thus, the step from thesis to ambivalence is painful, and the next stepfrom ambivalence to ecstasy is difficult to achieve. The symbol of the ‘Centre’,the blue rose, the golden flower, the way out of the labyrinth—all these can alludeto the meeting and ‘conjunction’ of the conscious and the unconscious, as of theunion of the lover and the beloved. Metaphors such as ‘The wolf also shall dwellwith the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and theyoung lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them’ (Isaiah xi, 6),are references to the final coming of the Heavenly Jerusalem (25), where thebinary synthesis is no longer dualistic severance or otherness, difference or sepa-ration, nor a balancing of opposing powers, but the assimilation of the lower bythe higher, of darkness by light. The symbolism of ascension or ascent alludes notonly to the possibility of a superior life for the privileged being, an initiate orsaint, a hero or a thinker, but also to the primary and fundamental tendency of thecosmos to strive towards sublimation—to progress from mud to tears, from leadto gold. Rhythms vary, but movement is always in the same direction. Hindudoctrine refers not only to hope of Nirvana but also to the lessons to be learntfrom mâyâ, or illusion. In the world of mâyâ—the world of phenomena—oppo-sites cancel each other out, one opposite being balanced by another through theceaseless interplay and transmutation of existence—the alternation of creationand destruction (60). The figure of the goddess Kâli, for instance, whose ritualrequired human sacrifice, is an example of symbolic counterpoise transcendingthe mere duality of opposing forces. The moral level reached by any religion canin fact be measured by its capacity to show, by means of dogma and imagery, howduality is transcended. One of the most powerfully poetic myths expressing thewish for cosmic unity is that in which it is said that the sun and the moon must be‘united’ so that they are made to form a single being (17).Bird Every winged being is symbolic of spiritualization. The bird, accord-ing to Jung, is a beneficent animal representing spirits or angels, supernaturalaid (31), thoughts and flights of fancy (32). Hindu tradition has it that birdsrepresent the higher states of being. To quote a passage from the Upanishads:Two birds, inseparable companions, inhabit the same tree; the first eats of thefruit of the tree, the second regards it but does not eat. The first bird is Jivâtmâ,and the second is Atmâ or pure knowledge, free and unconditioned; and whenthey are joined inseparably, then the one is indistinguishable from the other"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"BIRD27except in an illusory sense’ (26). This interpretation of the bird as symbolic ofthe soul is very commonly found in folklore all over the world. There is a Hindutale retold by Frazer in which an ogre explains to his daughter where he keepshis soul: ‘Sixteen miles away from this place’, he says, ‘is a tree. Round the treeare tigers, and bears, and scorpions, and snakes; on the top of the tree is a verygreat fat snake; on his head is a little cage; in the cage is a bird; and my soul is inthat bird’ (21). This was given precise expression in ancient Egyptian symbol-ism by supplying the bird with a human head; in their system of hieroglyphs itwas a sign corresponding to the determinative Ba (the soul), or the idea that thesoul flies away from the body after death (19). This androcephalous bird ap-pears also in Greek and Romanesque art, and always in this same sense (50).But the idea of the soul as a bird—the reverse of the symbolic notion—does notof itself imply that the soul is good. Hence the passage in Revelation (xvii, 2)describing Babylon as ‘the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every uncleanand hateful bird’. According to Loeffler, the bird, like the fish, was originally aphallic symbol, endowed however with the power of heightening—suggestingsublimation and spiritualization. In fairy stories there are many birds whichtalk and sing, symbolizing amorous yearning (and cognate with arrows andbreezes). The bird may also stand for the metamorphosis of a lover. Loeffleradds that birds are universally recognized as intelligent collaborators with manin myths and folktales, and that they are derived from the great bird-demiurgesof the primitives—bearers of celestial messages and creators of the netherworld; this explains the further significance of birds as messengers (38). Theparticular colour of a bird is a factor which determines its secondary symbol-isms. The blue bird is regarded by Bachelard (3) as ‘the outcome of aerialmotion’, that is, as a pure association of ideas; but in our view, although thismay well have been its origin, its ultimate aim is something quite different—toprovide a symbol of the impossible (like the blue rose). In alchemy, birds standfor forces in process of activation; here the precise sense is determined by thelocation of the bird: soaring skywards it expresses volatilization or sublima-tion, and swooping earthwards it expresses precipitation and condensation;these two symbolic movements joined to form a single figure are expressive ofdistillation. Winged beings contrasted with others that are wingless constitute asymbol of air, of the volatile principle as opposed to the fixed. Nevertheless, asDiel has pointed out, birds, and particularly flocks of birds—for multiplicity isever a sign of the negative—may take on evil implications; for example, swarmsof insects symbolize forces in process of dissolution—forces which are teem-ing, restless, indeterminate, shattered. Thus, birds, in the Hercules legend, ris-"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"BIRDS28ing up from the lake Stymphalus (which stands for the stagnation of the souland the paralysis of the spirit) denote manifold wicked desires (15). The ‘giantbird’ is always symbolic of a creative deity. The Hindus of Vedic times used todepict the sun in the form of a huge bird—an eagle or a swan. Germanic traditionaffords further examples of a solar bird (35). It is also symbolic of storms; inScandinavian mythology there are references to a gigantic bird called Hraesvelg(or Hraesveglur), which is supposed to create the wind by beating its wings(35). In North America, the supreme Being is often equated with the mythicpersonification of lightning and thunder as a great bird (17). The bird has aformidable antagonist in the snake or serpent. According to Zimmer, it is onlyin the West that this carries a moral implication; in India, the natural elementsonly are contrasted—the solar force as opposed to the fluid energy of theterrestrial oceans. The name of this solar bird is Garuda, the ‘slayer of the nâgasor serpents’ (60). Kühn, in The Rock Pictures of Europe, considers a Lascauxcave picture of a wounded bison, a man stricken to death and a bird on a pole,and suggests that, by the late Palaeolithic, the bird may have come to symbolizethe soul or a trance-like state.Birds Birds are very frequently used to symbolize human souls, some ofthe earliest examples being found in the art of ancient Egypt. Sometimes, theyare depicted with human heads, as in Hellenic iconography. In the Mirach it iswritten that, when Mohammed went to heaven, he found, standing in the middleof a great square, the Tree of Life whose fruit restores youth to all those whoeat of it. This Tree of Life is surrounded by groves and avenues of leafy trees onwhose boughs perch many birds, brilliantly coloured and singing melodiously:these are the souls of the faithful. The souls of evildoers, on the other hand, areincarnated in birds of prey (46). Generally speaking, birds, like angels, aresymbols of thought, of imagination and of the swiftness of spiritual processesand relationships. They pertain to the Element of air and, as noted in connexionwith the eagle, they denote ‘height’ and—consequently—’loftiness’ of spirit.This general symbolism has sometimes been narrowed down excessively to theparticular, as often happens in traditional symbolism. Thus, Odo of Tusculum,in his sermon XCII, describes different kinds of spirituality in men in terms ofthe characteristics of different kinds of birds. Some birds, he says, are guileless,such as the dove; others, cunning like the partridge; some come to the hand, likethe hawk, others flee from it, like the hen; some enjoy the company of men, likethe swallow; others prefer solitude and the desert, like the turtle-dove. . . . Low-flying birds symbolize an earth-bound attitude; high-flying birds, spiritual longing(46)."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"BLOOD29Bite This, like the great majority of symbols, has a double meaning embracingboth the mystic and the psychological planes. On the mystic level, the bite, or,rather, teeth-marks, are equivalent to the imprint or the seal of the spirit upon theflesh (since the teeth are the fortress-walls of the ‘inner’ or spiritual man). On thepsychological level, and especially where animal-bites are concerned, it is sym-bolic, according to Jung, of the sudden and dangerous action of the instincts uponthe psyche (32).Blacksmith On some cultural levels, the position of blacksmith is consid-ered to be held under the king’s prerogative, and to be sacred (21). There is a closeconnexion between metallurgy and alchemy: According to Alleau, the blacksmithis equivalent to the accursed poet and the despised prophet. In the Rigveda, thecreator of the world is a blacksmith (31); this may be accounted for by theassociated symbolism of fire, but also by the fact that iron is associated with theastral world—the first iron known to man was meteoric—and with the planetMars.Blood From the standpoint of the chromatic or biological order, blood, sinceit corresponds to the colour red, represents the end of a series which begins withsunlight and the colour yellow, the intermediate stage being the colour green andvegetable life. The development from yellow to green and red appears in relationwith a corresponding increase of iron. In cases of relationships as close as thatbetween blood and the colour red, it is evident that both are reciprocally expres-sive: the passionate quality characteristic of red pervades the symbolism ofblood, and the vital character of blood informs the significance of the colour red.In spilt blood we have a perfect symbol of sacrifice. All liquid substances (milk,honey and wine, that is to say) which were offered up in antiquity to the dead, tospirits and to gods, were images of blood, the most precious offering of all.Sacrificial blood was obtained from the sheep, the hog and the bull in classicaltimes, and from human sacrifice among Asians, Africans and aboriginal Americans(as well as among the Europeans in prehistoric days). The Arabic saying, ‘Bloodhas flowed, the danger is past’, expresses succinctly the central idea of all sacri-fice: that the offering appeases the powers and wards off the most severe chas-tisements which might otherwise befall. The driving-force behind the mechanismof sacrifice, the most characteristic of the symbolic inferences of blood, is thezodiacal symbol of Libra, representing divine legality, the inner conscience of manwith its ability to inflict terrible self-chastisement. Wounds, by association, andfor the same reason, have a similar function. Similarly with the colour red when itsuse appears irrational—when it mysteriously invades the object: for example, inalchemy, when matter passes from the white stage (albedo) to the red (rubedo);"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"BLOW, TO30or the legendary ‘red knight’ who expresses the ever-passionate state of him whohas mastered steed and monster. The Parsifal of Chrétien de Troyes is a redknight, wreathed in a pattern of images of such beauty and richness that we willquote the whole of the passage: ‘A slab of red marble is floating on the water witha sword plunged into it. The knight who proves able to withdraw it will be adescendant of king David. He is clad in a coat of red silk and the aged manaccompanying him hands him a cloak of scarlet lined with white ermine. . . .Parsifal meets a knight whose red armour turns all eyes that regard it red. His axeis red, his shield and his lance are redder than fire. In his hand he holds a cup ofgold, his skin is white and his hair red.’ Lévi, in his penetrating study of thissymbol, quotes the following phrase: ‘He was clothed in garments stained withblood,’ for he had come through war and sacrifice (37). Of great interest, too,heightened by his discussion of the etymological sources, is the quotation sup-plied by Pinedo; the passage is taken from the commentary upon Isaiah lxiii, 1-2(‘Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? . . .Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel?’). Pinedo comments: ‘Edom and Bozrah—its capital—stand for all the nations of the Gentiles. The word Edom means “red”and Bozrah means “winepress”, which explains why the Holy Fathers say thathe who comes “red” from the “wine-press” is none other than Our Lord JesusChrist, for, according to them, this is the question which the angels put to him onthe day of his triumphal ascension’ (46).Blow, To For primitives, blowing is a creative act which infuses or enlivenslife, increases the force of something or changes its course. Shamans include theact of blowing in their rites.Boar The symbolic significance of the boar, as of most other animals, isambivalent. On the one hand it occurs as a symbol of intrepidness, and of theirrational urge towards suicide (8). On the other hand it stands for licentiousness(15). One of Vishnu’s incarnations was in the form of a boar. In Babylonia andother Semitic cultures it was regarded as a sacred animal. In Celtic and Galliclegends there is always a note of distinction and positiveness about it (4). As ahostile force the boar ranks higher than the dragon or primordial monster, butbelow the lion.Boat In the most general sense, a ‘vehicle’. Bachelard notes that there are agreat many references in literature testifying that the boat is the cradle rediscov-ered (and the mother’s womb) (2). There is also a connexion between the boat andthe human body.Body For Gichtel, it is ‘the seat of insatiable appetite, of illness and death’.In Mithraic thought (according to Evola) the soul, in order to free itself from thebody, must cross seven spheres."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"BOX31Bolt (or Latch) In Egyptian hieroglyphics, this sign represents the linksecuring the two halves of a double-door, symbolizing by analogy the will toresist any possibility of change (19).Bone A symbol of life as seen in the character of a seed. The Hebrew word luzstands for the mandorla, embracing both the tree and its inner, hidden and invio-lable heart. But according to Jewish tradition, it also refers to an indestructible,corporeal particle, represented by a piece of very hard bone; it is, then, symbolicof the belief in resurrection, and is comparable with the symbol of the chrysalisfrom which the butterfly emerges (28).Book A book is one of the eight Chinese common emblems, symbolizing thepower to ward off evil spirits (5). The book ‘written inside and out’ is an allegoryof the esoteric and exoteric, cognate with the double-edged sword projecting fromthe mouth (37). Broadly speaking, the book is related—as Guénon has sug-gested—to the symbolism of weaving. The doctrine of Mohiddin ibn Arabi in thisrespect may be summarized as follows: ‘The universe is an immense book; thecharacters of this book are written, in principle, with the same ink and transcribedon to the eternal tablet by the divine pen . . . and hence the essential divinephenomena hidden in the “secret of secrets” took the name of “transcendentletters”. And these very transcendent letters, or, in other words, all things created,after having been virtually crystallized within divine omniscience, were broughtdown to lower levels by the divine breath, where they gave birth to the manifestworld’ (25).Bottle According to Bayley, the bottle is one of the symbols of salvation (4),probably because of the analogy (of function rather than of shape) with the arkand the boat.Bow Shiva’s bow is, like the lingam, the emblem of the god’s power (60).Basic to this symbolism is the concept of ‘tension’, clearly defined by Heraclitusand closely related to the life-force and to spiritual force. Benoist remarks that thebow and arrow, as attributes of Apollo, stand for the sun’s energy, its rays and itsfertilizing and purifying powers (6). The symbolism of the crossbow is similar,but more complex, including, as it does, the ‘conjunction’ of the bow and itsstock.Bower Like the tower, the well and the door, it is a common emblem of theVirgin Mary. That powerful painter of female nature, John of Flanders (15th-16th centuries), frequently brings these themes to bear upon his works. Gener-ally speaking, the bower is a feminine symbol (32).Box Like all receptacles whose basic use is keeping or containing, the box isa feminine symbol which can refer both to the unconscious (15) and to thematernal body itself (31). We do not here refer to spherical objects, which are"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"BRAMBLE32symbols of Oneness and of the spiritual principle. The myth of ‘Pandora’s box’appears to allude to the significance of the unconscious, particularly in the specialsense of its unexpected, excessive, destructive potentialities. Diel relates thissymbol to ‘imaginative exaltation’ (15). In addition, we would like to point outthe analogy—the family resemblance—between Pandora’s box and the ‘thirdcasket’ which figures in so many legends. The first and second contain goods andriches; the third discharges storms, devastation, death. This is clearly an exampleof a symbol of human life (of the cycle of the year), which is divided into threestages, consisting of two favourable thirds and one adverse. A superb elaborationupon the Pandora theme is to be found in Dora and Erwin Panofsky’s Pandora’sBox (London, 1956). Particularly interesting is the authors’ study of the literaryheritage of a myth, and the ways in which it may be adapted to serve the visualarts.Bramble A symbol of virginal purity consumed in its own flame (20). TheBiblical burning bush, on the other hand, is symbolically related to the myth ofSemele.Branch When bearing blooms or fruit, it has the same significance as thegarland. In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs it means ‘to give way’ or ‘bend’(19).Branding or Marking The mark, especially when it takes the form of apainting or decoration (insignia) upon the body, is, like the seal, the sign or thesignal, cognate with tattooing. Such brands may also have an incidental meaningoccasioned by a particular circumstance (mourning, an initiation rite, etc.). Buttheir deepest significance is connected with the symbolism of scars as the marks‘of the teeth of the spirit’. A brand is a distinguishing mark—and this is theoriginal and predominating idea of each and every mark. The individual whowishes to ‘belong’ accepts the distinctive mark of the group he seeks to belong to;or if he wishes to express his own individuality, he can do so by means ofdeterminative, unrevealed signs. Artistic or spiritual creation of any kind, thedevelopment of the personality, the mask, idiosyncrasies of dress or behaviour,are all derived from the essence of mark-symbolism.Breathing Symbolically, to breathe is to assimilate spiritual power. Yogaexercises place particular emphasis upon breathing, since it enables man to absorbnot only air but also the light of the sun. Concerning solar light, the alchemists hadthis to say: ‘It is a fiery substance, a continuous emanation of solar corpuscleswhich, owing to the movement of the sun and the astral bodies, is in a perpetualstate of flux and change, filling all the universe. . . . We breathe this astral goldcontinuously.’ The two movements—positive and negative—of breathing areconnected with the circulation of the blood and with the important symbolic"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"BULL33paths of involution and evolution (3). Difficulty in breathing may therefore sym-bolize difficulty in assimilating the principles of the spirit and of the cosmos. The‘proper rhythm’ of Yoga-breathing is associated with the ‘proper voice’ de-manded by the Egyptians for the ritual reading of the sacred texts. Both arefounded upon imitation of the rhythms of the universe.Bridge According to Guénon, the Roman pontifex was literally a ‘builder ofbridges’, that is, of that which bridges two separate worlds. St. Bernard has saidthat the Roman Pontiff, as the etymology of his name suggests, is a kind of bridgebetween God and Man (Tractatus de Moribus et Officio Episcoporum, III, 9). Forthis reason, the rainbow is a natural symbol of the pontificate. For the Israelites,it was the sign of the Covenant between the Creator and his people, and, in China,the sign denoting the union of heaven and earth. For the Greeks, it was Iris, amessenger of the gods. And there are a great many cultures where the bridgesymbolizes the link between what can be perceived and what is beyond percep-tion (28). Even when it lacks this mystic sense, the bridge is always symbolic ofa transition from one state to another—of change or the desire for change.Bucentaur A monster, half-man and half-ox or bull. In some monumentsHercules is shown fighting a bucentaur or smothering it in his arms. Like thecentaur, this mythic animal is symbolic of the essential duality of man, but, in thiscase, stressing the baser—or animal—part. Hercules’ struggle with the bucentauris the archetype of all mythic combat: Theseus and the Minotaur, Siegfried andthe dragon, etc. (8).Buckle The buckle implies self-defence and protection, like the fibula on theone hand (which is the shield reduced to its minimal form), and the belt on theother (4). To undo one’s belt is symbolically the same as ‘letting one’s hair down’.Bucraneum A decorative motif deriving from the appearance of the remainsof the head of the bull or ox, after it had been sacrificed by fire in ancient ritual(41).Bull The bull is associated with the symbolism of Taurus (q.v.). It is a highlycomplex symbol, both from the historical and psychological point of view. Inesoteric tradition it is an emblem used by the Hyperboreans as a totem against thedragon of the Negroes, and is equated with the god Thor, the son of heaven and ofwoodland (49). In principle, this emblematic use symbolizes the superiority ofthe mammal over the reptile, or of the Aryan over the Negro. The basic dilemmalies between the interpretation of the bull as a symbol of the earth, of the mother,and of the ‘wetness’ principle (11); and the view that it represents heaven and thefather. Mithraic ritual seems to have been founded on the former: the sacrifice ofthe bull was expressive of the penetration of the feminine principle by the mas-culine, of the humid by the igniferous (the rays of the sun, the origin and cause of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"BULL34all fecundity). Krappe, investigating these paradoxes, has pointed to the fact thatthe bull is the commonest tame animal of the Near East and relates this to the factthat bulls are depicted as lunar as often as solar (that is, they may be subject toeither one or the other of the opposed principles we have just outlined). Sin wasa Mesopotamian lunar god and he often took the form of a bull; Osiris, also a lunargod, was supposedly represented by the bull Apis. On the other hand, the Vedicgod Sûrya is a solar bull. According to the Assyrians, the bull was born of the sun.Krappe explains this disparity not as an internal contradiction but as a conse-quence of the way in which the lunar and the solar cults succeed one another. Thelunar bull becomes solar when the solar cult supplants the more ancient cult of themoon (35). But it may well be that the bull is first and foremost a lunar symbolbecause it is equated with the moon morphologically by virtue of the resemblanceof the horns of the crescent moon, while it must take second place to the solarsymbol of the lion. This is the view expressed by Eliade, for example, whosuggests that the bull does not represent any of the astral bodies but rather thefecundating sky and that, from the year 2400 B.C. onwards, both the bull and thethunderbolt were symbols connected with the atmospheric deities, the bull’sbellow being associated with the rolling of thunder. In all palaeo-oriental cultures,it was the bull which expressed the idea of power. In Accadian, ‘to break the horn’signified ‘to overpower’ (17). According to Frobenius, the black bull is linkedwith the lower heaven, that is, with death. This belief prevailed in India; and inlands as remote as Java and Bali which fell under the influence of Indian culture,it was the custom to burn the bodies of princes in coffins shaped like bulls. Thereare Egyptian paintings of a black bull bearing the corpse of Osiris on its back (22).This interpretation is supported by Schneider’s observation that, in so far as thebull corresponds to the intermediary zone between the Elements of Fire andWater, it seems to symbolize the communicating link between heaven and earth,a significance which could also apply to the bull of the royal tombs of Ur, whichhas a head of gold (representing fire) and a jowl of lapis lazuli (water). The oxsymbolizes sacrifice, self-denial and chastity, and is also found in associationwith agricultural cults (50); it is, in other words, the symbolic antithesis of thebull, with its fecundating powers. If we accept that the bull is Uranian in implica-tion, however, then the contradiction is resolved and the bull may be linked withthe active, masculine principle, although only in so far as its maternal aspect hasbeen superseded—supplanted, that is, by the son (the Sun or the lion). This, atleast, is what Jung has suggested, together with the idea that the bull, like the he-goat, is a symbol for the father (31)."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"CADUCEUS35Bunch In Christian art, a bunch or cluster always symbolizes Christ andsacrifice. So, in the book of Numbers (xiii, 23), one reads: ‘and (they) cut downfrom thence a branch with one cluster of grapes’ (46).Butterfly Among the ancients, an emblem of the soul and of unconsciousattraction towards the light (8). The purification of the soul by fire, representedin Romanesque art by the burning ember placed by the angel in the prophet’smouth, is visually portrayed on a small Mattei urn by means of an image of loveholding a butterfly close to a flame (8). The Angel of Death was represented bythe Gnostics as a winged foot crushing a butterfly, from which we may deducethat the butterfly was equated with life rather than with the soul in the sense ofthe spirit or transcendent being (36). This also explains why psychoanalysisregards the butterfly as a symbol of rebirth (56). In China, it has the secondarymeanings of joy and conjugal bliss (5).CCabiri They are earth-god symbols, personified as little dwarfs, whoseinvisibility is implied by the hood covering their head. They were conceived to bedeities watching over shipwrecked men. In all probability they are symbols of theextraordinary ‘powers’ held in reserve by the human spirit (32).Caduceus A wand with two serpents twined round it, surmounted by twosmall wings or a winged helmet. The rational and historical explanation is thesupposed intervention of Mercury in a fight between two serpents who there-upon curled themselves round his wand. For the Romans, the caduceus served asa symbol of moral equilibrium and of good conduct. The wand represents power;the two snakes wisdom; the wings diligence (8); and the helmet is an emblem oflofty thoughts. To-day the caduceus is the insignia of the Catholic bishop in theUkraine. The caduceus also signifies the integration of the four elements, thewand corresponding to earth, the wings to air, the serpents to fire and water (byanalogy with the undulating movement of waves and flames) (56). This symbol isvery ancient, and is to be found for example in India engraved upon stone tabletscalled nâgakals, a kind of votive offering placed at the entrance to temples.Heinrich Zimmer traces the caduceus back to Mesopotamia, detecting it in the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"CADUCEUS36design of the sacrificial cup of king Gudea of Lagash (2600 B.C.). Zimmer evengoes so far as to state that the symbol probably dates back beyond this period,for the Mesopotamians considered the intertwining serpents as a symbol of thegod who cures all illness, a meaning which passed into Greek culture and is stillpreserved in emblems of our day (60). According to esoteric Buddhism, the wandof the caduceus corresponds to the axis of the world and the serpents refer to theforce called Kundalini, which, in Tantrist teaching, sleeps coiled up at the base ofthe backbone—a symbol of the evolutive power of pure energy (40). Schneidermaintains that the two S-shapes of the serpents correspond to illness and conva-lescence (51).

Its dual nature, expressed allegori-cally in the form of a goat whose body terminates in a fish’s tail, refers to the dualtendencies of life towards the abyss (or water) on the one hand, and the heights(or mountains) on the other; these two currents also signify, in Hindu doctrine,the involutive and evolutive possibilities: the return to or the departure from the‘wheel of rebirth’ (that is, the Zodiac).Zodiacal sign of Capricorn.Zodiacal sign ofCancer.Hebraicseven-branchedcandelabra"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"CATASTROPHE39Cask, Bottomless A famous Greek symbol which, as in the legend of theDanaides, symbolizes useless labour and, on another level, the apparent futilityof all existence (8).Castle This is a complex symbol, derived at once from that of the house andthat of the enclosure or walled city. Walled cities figure in mediaeval art as asymbol of the transcendent soul and of the heavenly Jerusalem. Generally speak-ing, the castle is located on the top of a mountain or hill, which suggests anadditional and important meaning derived from the symbolism of level. Its shape,form and colour, its dark and light shades, all play an important part in definingthe symbolic meaning of the castle as a whole, which, in the broadest sense, is anembattled, spiritual power, ever on the watch. The ‘black castle’ has been inter-preted as the alchemists’ lair, as well as a rain cloud poised above a mountain-top(50). Its significance as the Mansion of the Beyond, or as the entrance to theOther World, would seem obvious enough. In a great many legends, the Castle ofDarkness, inhabited by a ‘Black Knight’, is symbolic of the abode of Pluto; thisis confirmed by Theseus’ mythic journey into hell. Charon has his abode in asimilar castle which is inaccessible to living men (the ‘castle of no return’ offolktales). In the legendary heaven of Nordic tradition, the same meaning is to befound. Melwas, the abducter of Guinevere, dwells in a castle surrounded by adeep moat, the only means of access being two bridges difficult to negotiate.According to Krappe, it is very possible that the underlying symbolism of allmediaeval tales and legends about a castle owned by a ‘wicked knight’ who holdscaptive all who approach his domain may well be that of the sinister castle of theLord of the Underworld (35). On the other hand, the ‘Castle of Light’ is the‘redemption’-aspect of this same image. Piobb explains that the sudden appear-ance of a castle in the path of a wanderer is like the sudden awareness of a spiritualpattern. ‘Before this fascinating vision, all fatigue disappears. One has the clearimpression that treasure lies within. The splendid temple is the achieving of theinconceivable, the materialization of the unexpected’ (48). The castle, in sum,together with the treasure (that is, the eternal essence of spiritual wealth), thedamsel (that is, the anima in the Jungian sense) and the purified knight, make upa synthesis expressive of the will to salvation.Cat The Egyptians associated the cat with the moon, and it was sacred to thegoddesses Isis and Bast, the latter being the guardian of marriage (57). A second-ary symbolism is derived from its colour; the black cat is associated with dark-ness and death.Catastrophe A general symbol for a change wrought by mutation in a singleprocess, and a frequent sign for the beginnings of psychic transformation (56).

Whether the catastrophe is, in the symbolic sense, positive or negative is,of course, entirely dependent upon the nature of the change wrought in the agentaffected by it.Cauldron Like the skull, a symbol of the receptacle of the forces of transmu-tation and germination. But whereas the skull, because of its vaulted shape,signifies the higher, sublimated and spiritual aspects of this process, the cauldron,being open at the top, has the opposite meaning of the baser forces of nature.Most of the mythic cauldrons which figure in Celtic tradition are located at thebottom of the sea or of lakes (indicating that the respective symbolisms of thecauldron and of water have coalesced, and that they both relate to the generalsymbolism of water, which is the vehicle of life and the medial element parexcellence). We can see, then, that the skull is the receptacle for the ‘upper ocean’or the reflection of it in Man, whereas the cauldron—the inversion of the skull—is the vessel for the ‘lower ocean’. This is why pots and cauldrons figure so oftenin legends about magic and in folktales (17). The chalice is a sublimation and aconsecration of the cauldron as well as of the cup, which is a pure symbol ofcontainment (Plate IV).Cave or Cavern Broadly speaking, its meaning is probably confined to thatof the general symbolism of containment, of the enclosed or the concealed. Itunderlies certain images such as the mediaeval cave which symbolizes the humanheart as the spiritual ‘centre’ (14). For Jung, it stands for the security and theimpregnability of the unconscious. It appears fairly often in emblematic andmythological iconography as the meeting-place for figures of deities, forebears orarchetypes, becoming therefore an objective image of Hades, although still ex-pressive of the psychological unconscious (32). Cult sites in prehistory—somecaves showing traces of the Ice Age were later made into Christian shrines. Lourdesis a religious cave of the Quaternary. Kühn has found traces of recent offerings inNorth African sites with prehistoric indications. Caves, with their darkness, arewomb-symbols. That the German Höhle (cave) and Holle (hell) are related is notwithout significance. (See Herbert Kühn, The Rock Pictures of Europe.)Centaur A fabulous being, half-man, half-horse, supposed by some to be thefruit of the union of Centaurus and the Magnesian mares. From a symbolic pointof view the centaur is the antithesis of the knight, that is, it represents thecomplete domination of a being by the baser forces: in other words, it denotescosmic force, the instincts, or the unconscious, uncontrolled by the spirit."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"CENTRE41Centre To leave the circumference for the centre is equivalent to movingfrom the exterior to the interior, from form to contemplation, from multiplicity tounity, from space to spacelessness, from time to timelessness. In all symbolsexpressive of the mystic Centre, the intention is to reveal to Man the meaning ofthe primordial ‘paradisal state’ and to teach him to identify himself with thesupreme principle of the universe (29). This centre is in effect Aristotle’s ‘un-moved mover’ and Dante’s ‘L’Amore che muove il sole a l’altre stelle’ (27).Similarly, Hindu doctrine declares that God resides in the centre, at that pointwhere the radii of a wheel meet at its axis (51). In diagrams of the cosmos, thecentral space is always reserved for the Creator, so that he appears as if sur-rounded by a circular or almond-shaped halo (formed by the intersection of thecircle of heaven with the circle of the earth), surrounded by concentric circlesspreading outwards, and by the wheel of the Zodiac, the twelve-monthly cycle oflabour upon the land, and a four-part division corresponding both to the seasonsand to the tetramorph. Among the Chinese, the infinite being is frequently sym-bolized as a point of light with concentric circles spreading outwards from it. InWestern emblems, an eagle’s head sometimes carries the same significance (4). Insome Hindu mandalas, such as the Shri-Yantra, the centre itself is not actuallyportrayed, but has to be supplied mentally by the contemplator; the Shri-Yantrais a ‘form in expansion’ (and a symbol, therefore, of the creation), composed ofnine intersecting triangles circumscribed by a lotus flower and a square. A greatmany ritual acts have the sole purpose of finding out the spiritual ‘Centre’ of alocality, which then becomes the site, either in itself or by virtue of the templebuilt upon it, of an ‘image of the world’. There are also many legends which tellof pilgrimages to places with characteristics which relate them to Paradise. ThisChinese tale, for example, retold by the orientalist Wilhelm in his work on Lao-Tse: ‘King Huangti had a dream. He crossed into the kingdom of the Hua Hsü.The kingdom of the Hua Hsü is west of the far West and north of the far North.It is not known how many hundreds of thousands of leagues it is from the Ch’istate. It can be reached neither by boat nor by carriage, nor on foot. It can bereached only by the spirit in flight. This country has no sovereign: everyone actsaccording to his own dictates; the people have no lawmakers: everyone actsaccording to his own dictates. The joys of life are not known, nor is the fear ofdeath; so there is no premature death. Self-withdrawal is not known, nor is theshunning of one’s fellows; so there is no love and no hate. Revulsion from what isdistasteful is not known, nor is the search for pleasure; so there is no profit andno harm. No one has any preference, no one has any dislike.

This concept ofthe Centre coincides, of course, with that of the ‘Land of the Dead’, in which thetheme of the coincidentia oppositorum of mystic tradition comes to signify not somuch ‘opposition’ as neutralization, in the characteristically oriental sense. TheCentre is located at the point of intersection of the two arms of the superficial (ortwo-dimensional) cross, or of the three arms of the essential, three-dimensionalcross. In this position it expresses the dimension of the ‘infinite depth’ of space,that is, the seed of the eternal cycle of the flux and flow of forms and beings, aswell as the dimensions of space itself. In some liturgical crosses, as for examplethat of Cong in Ireland, the centre is marked by a precious stone.Centre, Spiritual In Le Roi du Monde, René Guénon speaks of the ‘spiri-tual centre’ which was established in the terrestrial world to conserve intact atreasure of ‘non-human’ knowledge. This, he suggests, is no less than the origin ofthe concept of ‘tradition’ from which are derived all the religious, mythical andphilosophical customs and explanations of the world. Guénon points out thatSaint-Yves d’Alveydre, in a posthumous work (La Mission de l’Inde, 1910),places Agarttha at the centre. The author connects this symbolic city with theRosicrucians’ ‘solar citadel’ and Campanella’s City of the Sun.Cerberus A three-headed dog whose throat bristled with serpents. He wasthe guardian of the abode of Pluto on the banks of the Stygian lake. Neoplatonicdoctrine saw in him a symbol of the evil genius. Later he came to be interpreted asthe emblem of rotting in the grave, for if Hercules overcame him it was onlybecause his tasks were directed towards the attainment of immortality (8). Thethree heads of Cerberus are—like the trident—the infernal replica of divine triunity.They are also related to the three Gorgons (40). In all threefold symbols of thebaser forces of life, Diel, following his system of moral interpretation, sees thedegradation of the three vital ‘urges’ (of conservation, reproduction and spiritual-ization), bringing about the death of the soul, which is why Cerberus, the guardianof dead souls in Tartarus, is charged with the task of preventing their return intothe world above where atonement and salvation are still possible (15).Chain The Egyptian hieroglyphic sign in the shape of a vertical chain ofthree links formed by two lines intertwining (with a fourth link, left open, at thebottom) holds a dual symbolism: on the one hand, that of the caduceus of Mer-cury, standing for the dual streams—involution and evolution—of the universe(19); and on the other, implying the general symbolism of the chain, that is, bonds"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"CHARIOT43and communication. On the cosmic plane it is the symbol of the marriage ofheaven and earth, similar to other symbols such as the cry of pain, the whistle ofthe stone hurled skywards by the sling, and the arrow (50). On the plane ofearthly existence it is the symbol of matrimony: each link actually or potentiallycorresponding to a blood-relationship: father and mother, sons and daughters,brothers (51). In a wider sense related to the symbolism of bonds and cords,bands and twine, it is a symbol of social or psychic integration along with thesecondary but very important characteristic of the toughness of its material.Amongst the Gauls there were comrades in arms who would enter into combatchained together in pairs so that if one died, his companion was bound to fall too.A saying that is powerfully evocative of the spiritual significance of the chainsymbol is attributed to Louis XI of France: presenting a golden chain to Raoul deLannoi as an award for bravery, the king exclaimed: ‘Par le Pâque-Dieu, myfriend, thou art so ferocious in battle that thou must be chained up, for I do notwish to lose thee lest I need thy help once more’.Chalice The chalice of Christian liturgy is the transcendental form of thecup. Related to the Grail, it frequently takes the form of two halves of a sphereplaced back to back. In this, the lower part of the sphere becomes a receptacleopen to the spiritual forces, while the upper part closes over the earth, which itduplicates symbolically. The chalice has a certain affinity with the Celtic symbol-ism of the cauldron.Chaos Realistic philosophy sees chaos as the earliest state of disorganizedcreation, blindly impelled towards the creation of a new order of phenomena ofhidden meanings (22). Blavatsky, for example, asks: ‘What is primordial chaosbut the ether containing within itself all forms and all beings, all the seeds ofuniversal creation?’ Plato and the Pythagoreans maintained that this ‘primordialsubstance’ was the soul of the world, called protohyle by the alchemists. Thus,chaos is seen as that which embraces all opposing forces in a state of undifferen-tiated dissolution. In primordial chaos, according to Hindu tradition, one alsomeets Amrita—immortality—and Visha—evil and death (9). In alchemy, chaoswas identified with prime matter and thought to be a massa confusa from whichthe lapis would arise (32); it was related to the colour black. It has also beenidentified with the unconscious. But it is better to regard chaos as the statepreceding the condition of the unconscious.Chariot One of the basic analogies in the universal tradition of symbolism isthat of the chariot in relation to the human being. The charioteer represents theself of Jungian psychology; the chariot the human body and also thought in itstransitory aspects relative to things terrestrial; the horses are the life-force; and"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"CHARIOT, THE44the reins denote intelligence and will-power. This is a meaning which also appearsin Cabalistic writing, where it is given the name ascribed to the chariot itself—Merkabah (40, 55). The ‘Sun Chariot’ is the Great Vehicle of esoteric Buddhism(4); the ‘Chariot of Fire’, according to René Guénon, may be a symbol of thedynamic and overriding power of the subtle mind (26). Be that as it may, talesabout gods or fairies travelling in chariots across land, sea or sky are very frequentand of obvious symbolic interest. The exact details of the vehicle and of theanimals drawing it always contribute something to the symbolism of the chariotas a whole. So Perrault in his literary version of the folktale La Biche au Bois,says: ‘Each fairy had a chariot of a different material: one was made of ebonydrawn by white pigeons; others were of ivory drawn by crows; and others weremade of cedarwood. . . . When the fairies became angry, their chariots would beharnessed only to winged dragons or serpents breathing fire out of their mouthand eyes.’ The Sun Chariot (or the Chariot of Fire) is, in Loeffler’s view, sopowerful an archetype that it has found its way into most of the mythologies ofthe world. When it bears a hero, it becomes the emblem of the hero’s bodyconsumed in the service of the soul. The appearance, nature and colour of theteam of animals drawing it represent the qualities, good or bad, of the motivesdriving the chariot onwards in fulfilment of its mission. Hence (for example) thehorses of Arjuna (in the Vedic epic) are white, signifying the purity of the driver.A regional Polish tale has it that the Sun Chariot is drawn by three horses, onesilver, one gold and one made of diamonds (38). This threefold aspect comes fromthe well-known significance of the number 3, as in the triple mandorlas and othercomparable symbols and emblems.Chariot, The The seventh enigma of the Tarot pack. It depicts a youth cladin a cuirass, bearing a sceptre, and riding in a symbolic chariot. He incarnates thehigher principles of Man’s nature. In the chariot there can be seen an emblem ofthe Egyptian winged globe, representing the sublimation of matter and its evolutivemotion. Furthermore, the chariot has red wheels, which are to be related to thewhirlwinds of fire in the vision of Ezekiel. These wheels stand out in contrast tothe blue canopy or pallium which covers the chariot, signifying the differencebetween the absolute and the relative. The allegory of this image is reflected in itssmallest details. So, for example, the cuirass of the charioteer represents hisdefence against the baser forces of life; it is secured with five gold studs, denotingthe four elements and the quintessence. On his shoulders there are two crescentmoons representing the world of forms. The chariot is drawn by what at firstseems to be a pair of sphinxes but which is in fact a two-headed amphisbaena,symbolizing the hostile forces which one must subjugate in order to go forward"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"CHILD45(in the same way as the two serpents counterbalance one another in the cadu-ceus). Basil Valentine, in his L’Azoth des Philosophes (Paris, 1660), illustratesthis principle of duality with a serpent coiled round the sun and moon, its ex-tremities bearing the likeness of a lion and an eagle. This Tarot mystery, then, isassociated with concepts of self-control, progress and victory (59).Chequers Any pattern consisting of squares, lozenges or rectangles, inalternating white and black colours (that is, positive and negative), or, for thatmatter, in other pairs of colours, stands in symbolic relation to the duality ofelements inherent in the extension of time and hence in destiny. Thus, the Romanswould mark a happy or an unhappy day with a white or a black stone respec-tively. The colour of chequer-work changes its meaning according to the particu-lar symbolism of the colours. The significance of chequers, then, embraces con-cepts of combination, demonstration, chance or potentiality (48), as well as theeffort to control irrational impulses by containing them within a given order. Allorthogonal forms are symbols of the reason and the intellect, but not of the spirit,because the latter is content par excellence, whereas the rational never manages tobe more than a system of apprehending things, that is, a container. The heraldiclozenge is a development of the chequerboard, the form of which is such that itrepresents the dynamic interaction of the two elements which, in all forms ofchequer, are opposed and counterpoised one against the other in a pattern ofduality. It is significant that the costume of the harlequin (a chthonian deity) isactually chequered or made up of lozenges, which proves beyond doubt that theharlequin is related to the gods of destiny.Cherubim The cherubim or Kirubi (or Kherebu) which stood at the entranceto Assyrian temples and palaces were, according to Marques-Rivière, nothingless than gigantic pentacles placed there by the priests as ‘keepers of the thresh-old’—a function which in China was fulfilled by griffins and dragons (39). TheEgyptian cherub was a figure with many wings, and covered with eyes; it was anemblem of the night sky, of religion and vigilance (8).Child A symbol of the future, as opposed to the old man who signifies thepast (49); but the child is also symbolic of that stage of life when the old man,transformed, acquires a new simplicity—as Nietzsche implied in Thus SpakeZarathustra when dealing with the ‘three transformations’. Hence the concep-tion of the child as symbolic of the ‘mystic Centre’ and as the ‘youthful, re-awakening force’ (56). In Christian iconography, children often appear as angels;on the aesthetic plane they are found as putti in Baroque grotesque and ornamen-tations; and in traditional symbology they are dwarfs or Cabiri.

In alchemy, the child wearing a crown or regal garments is asymbol of the philosopher’s stone, that is, of the supreme realization of mysticidentification with the ‘god within us’ and with the eternal.Chimaera A monster born of Typhon and Echidna. It is represented ashaving a lion’s head, the body of a goat and the tail of a dragon. Flames flicker fromout of its mouth.

The best-known allegory ofchoice shows a woman dressed in violet (signifying indecision, according to OttoWeininger, because as a colour it is neither blue nor red), standing at a cross-roads,with a snake crawling along one of the paths; and she is pointing to a verdant treegrowing in the other path (8).Chrism The signographic emblem of Christ, based on the combination of thefirst two letters of the word Xpi6to?, X and P.

When the soul leaves thebody, it resembles a cicada which leaves its chrysalis in order to become aninsect.’ In Schneider’s view, the mystic function of such a transformation presup-poses qualities of balance, regeneration and valour (51). The ritual mask, as wellas the theatre-mask, is probably closely connected with the idea of the chrysalisand metamorphosis. For, behind this mask, the transformation of an individual’spersonality is hidden from view.Chthonian Demons Various beings mentioned in mythologies come underthis heading, such as the Greek harpies and Erinyes, the Hindu Rakshasas, theArabic djinns, the Germanic elves and valkyries, etc. They are symbols of thanaticforces, of the death-wish in various guises: the subtle fascination of dreams, or theheroic thrill experienced by the man who answers the call to battle (35). The questfor death—extremes meet (because of the curve of the conceptual line)—is ap-parent in limit-situations, not only in the negative aspect but also—and princi-"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"CIRCLE47pally—at the peak of the affirmative. That is, vital optimism and perfect happi-ness of necessity imply the other extreme, that is, the presence of death.Circle At times it is synonymous with the circumference, just as the circum-ference is often equated with circular movement. But although its general meaningembraces both aspects, there are some further details which it is important toemphasize. The circle or disk is, very frequently, an emblem of the sun (andindisputably so when it is surrounded by rays). It also bears a certain relationshipto the number ten (symbolizing the return to unity from multiplicity) (49), whenit comes to stand for heaven and perfection (4) and sometimes eternity as well(20). There are profound psychological implications in this particular concept ofperfection. As Jung observes, the square, representing the lowest of the compos-ite and factorial numbers, symbolizes the pluralist state of man who has notachieved inner unity (perfection) whilst the circle would correspond to this ulti-mate state of Oneness. The octagon is the intermediate state between the squareand the circle. Representations of the relationship between the circle and thesquare are very common in the universal and spiritual world of morphology,notably in the mandalas of India and Tibet and in Chinese emblems. Indeed,according to Chochod, in China, activity, or the masculine principle (Yang), isrepresented by a white circle (depicting heaven), whereas passivity, the feminineprinciple (Yin) is denoted by a black square (portraying earth). The white circlestands for energy and celestial influences and the black square for telluric forces.The interaction implicit in dualism is represented by the famous symbol of theChinese Yang-Yin, surrounded by the eight trigrams."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"CIRCUMFERENCE48Yang-Yin, a circle divided into two equal sections by a sigmoid line across thediameter, the white section (Yang) having a black spot within it, and the black(Yin) a white spot. These two spots signify that there is always something of thefeminine in the masculine and something of the masculine in the feminine. Thesigmoid line is a symbol of the movement of communication and serves thepurpose of implying—like the swastika—the idea of rotation, so imparting adynamic and complementary character to this bipartite symbol. The law of po-larity has been, the subject of much thought among Chinese philosophers, whohave deduced from this bipolar symbol a series of principles of unquestionablevalue, which we here transcribe: (a) the quantity of energy distributed throughoutthe universe is invariable; (b) it consists of the sum of two equal amounts ofenergy, one positive and active in kind and the other negative and passive; (c) thenature of cosmic phenomena is characterized by the varying proportions of thetwo modes of energy involved in their creation. In the twelve months of the year,for example, there is a given quantity of energy drawn from six parts of Yang andsix of Yin, in varying proportions (13). We must also point to the relationshipbetween the circle and the sphere, which is a symbol of the All.Circumference A symbol of adequate limitation, of the manifest world, ofthe precise and the regular (25), as well as of the inner unity of all matter and alluniversal harmony, as understood by the alchemists. Enclosing beings, objects orfigures within a circumference has a double meaning: from within, it implieslimitation and definition; from without, it is seen to represent the defence of thephysical and psychic contents themselves against the perils of the soul threaten-ing it from without, these dangers being, in a way, tantamount to chaos, but moreparticularly to illimitation and disintegration (32). Circumferential movement,which the Gnostics turned into one of their basic emblems by means of the figureof the dragon, the serpent or the fish biting its tail, is a representation of time. TheOuroboros (the circle formed by a dragon biting its own tail) is to be found in theCodex Marcianus (of the 2nd century A.D.) and also in the Greek legend Hen toPan (The One, The All), which explains how its meaning embraces all cyclicsystems (unity, multiplicity and the return to unity; evolution and involution;birth, growth, decrease, death, etc.). The alchemists took up this Gnostic symboland applied it to the processes of their symbolic opus of human destiny (32).Now, by virtue of its movement as much as by its shape, circular motion carriesthe further significance of that which brings into being, activates and animates allthe forces involved in any given process, sweeping them along with it, includingthose forces which would otherwise act against each other. As we have seen, thismeaning is basic in the Chinese Yang-Yin emblem (30). Almost all representations"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"CLOAK49of tune have some bearing upon the circle, as for example the mediaeval represen-tations of the year.Cithara (or Cithern) A symbol of the cosmos, its strings corresponding tothe levels of the universe. Being rounded on one side and flat on the other (like theturtle), it comes to signify the synthesis of heaven and earth (14, 50).City Up to a certain point it corresponds to landscape-symbolism in general,of which it forms one representational aspect, embracing the important symbolsof level and space, that is, height and situation. With the dawning of history therearose, according to René Guénon, a true, ‘sacred geography’ and the position,shape, doors and gates, and general disposition of a city with its temples andacropolis were never arbitrary or fortuitous, or merely utilitarian. In fact, citieswere planned in strict accord with the dictates of a particular doctrine; hence thecity became a symbol of that doctrine and of the society which upheld it (28).The city walls had magic powers since they were the outward signs of dogma,which explains and justifies Romulus’s fratricide. Ornamental reliefs on capitals,lintels, and tympana of the Middle Ages often depict the outlines of a walled city,although in a way which is more emblematic than symbolic. These ornaments area kind of prefiguration of the heavenly Jerusalem. An angel armed with a sword issometimes to be seen at the city gate (46). Jung sees the city as a mother-symboland as a symbol of the feminine principle in general: that is, he interprets the Cityas a woman who shelters her inhabitants as if they were her children; that is whythe two mother-gods Rhea and Cybele—as well as other allegorical figures de-rived from them—wear a crown after the pattern of a wall. The Old Testamentspeaks of cities as women (31).Climate The analogy between a state of mind and a given climate, as ex-pressed by the interplay between space, situation, the elements and temperature,as well as level-symbolism, is one of the most frequent of all analogies in litera-ture. Nietzsche, for example, embarked upon a passionate quest for the trueclimate—for the exact geographic location—corresponding to the inner ‘climate’of the thinker (3). The universal value of pairs of opposites, such as high/low,dry/wet, clear/dark, is demonstrated in their continued use not only in physicaland material but also in psychological, intellectual and spiritual matters.Cloak Within the symbolism of garments, the cloak is, on the one hand, thesign of superior dignity, and, on the other, of a veil cutting off a person from theworld (48). The cloak of Apollonius is an expression of the complete self-posses-sion of the sage, isolating him from the instinctive currents that move the gener-ality of mankind (37). The actual position of the cloak is of great importance indetermining the secondary symbolic meanings. For example, the Heddernheim"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"CLOCK50relief of Mithras slaying the bull has a cloak flying out in the wind like wings,thereby equating the hero and the victim with the celebrated alchemic marriage ofthe volatile with the fixed (31). The material, adornments, colour and shape of thecloak add further shades of meaning. The two colours of the outside and the insidealways correspond to a dual significance arising directly out of the symbolism ofcolours.Clock Like all circular forms incorporating a number of internal elements, theclock may be interpreted as a kind of mandala. Since the essence of the clock is totell the time, the predominant symbolism is that of number. As a machine, theclock is related to the notions of ‘perpetual motion’, automata, mechanism and tothe magical creation of beings that pursue their own autonomous existence.Clothes The wearing of skins by the Roman eagle-bearers appears to be oftotemic origin. Without attempting to establish any theoretical connexion be-tween a Sacher-Masoch’s concept of ‘skins’ and their habitual use by women,this possibility must not be forgotten. The spotted skin of an animal (such as apanther) or a multicoloured or shot fabric are symbols of the Whole (the god Pan).In Aurélia, which abounds in symbols, Nerval says: ‘and the goddess of mydreams appeared before me, smiling, dressed in Indian-style garments. . . . Shebegan to walk among us, and the meadows grew green again and the flowers andplants sprang up over the earth at the touch of her feet.’ In another passage,Nerval causes the drapery and designs of his beloved’s dress to become so con-fused with the flowers and plants in a garden that they grow indistinguishable.Clouds There are two principal aspects to cloud-symbolism: on the onehand they are related to the symbolism of mist, signifying the intermediate worldbetween the formal and the non-formal; and on the other hand they are associatedwith the ‘Upper Waters’—the realm of the antique Neptune. The former aspectof the cloud is symbolic of forms as phenomena and appearance, always in a stateof metamorphosis, which obscure the immutable quality of higher truth (37). Thesecond aspect of clouds reveals their family connexion with fertility-symbolismand their analogous relationship with all that is destined to bring fecundity. Hencethe fact that ancient Christian symbolism interprets the cloud as synonymouswith the prophet, since prophecies are an occult source of fertilization, celestialTrefoil."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"COCK51in origin (46). Hence also the conclusion of Bachelard that the cloud should betaken as a symbolic messenger (3).Clover (or Trefoil) An emblem of the Trinity. When it is located upon amountain it comes to signify knowledge of the divine essence gained by hardendeavour, through sacrifice or study (equivalent to ascension) (4). Trifoliateforms, such as the Gothic three-lobed arch, bear the same significance; and, broadlyspeaking, so do all tripartite forms. In the Middle Ages, triple time in music wasregarded in the same light, and it is so used by Scriabin in Prometheus.Clown Like the buffoon, the clown is a mythic figure, and the inversion of theking—the inversion, that is to say, of the possessor of supreme powers; hencethe clown is the victim chosen as a substitute for the king, in accord with thefamiliar astrobiological and primitive ideas of the ritual assassination of the king.The clown is the last, whereas the king is the first, but in the essential order ofthings the last comes second. This is confirmed by the folklore custom, men-tioned by Frazer, in which village youths, during Spring festivals, would race onhorseback up to the tallest mast (symbolizing the world-axis); he who came firstwas elected Easter king, and the last to arrive was made a clown and beaten (21).Coal Like charred wood, the symbolism of coal is closely linked with that offire. There is a certain ambivalence about it, since it sometimes appears as aconcentrated expression of fire, and sometimes as the negative (black, repressedor occult) side of energy. The chromatic relationship between black and red—between coal and flames—can be seen in myths and legends as recounted byKrappe. According to an Australian tradition, the fire-bearing bird (the demiurge)had a red spot on its black back. Similar beliefs existed amongst the Celts, and inAmerica and Asia (35).Cobweb Apart from its association with the spider, the symbolism of thespider’s web is identical with that of fabric. Because of its spiral shape, it alsoembraces the idea of creation and development—of the wheel and its centre. Butin this case death and destruction lurk at the centre, so that the web with thespider in the middle comes to symbolize what Medusa the Gorgon representswhen located in the centre of certain mosaics: the consuming whirlwind. It isprobably a symbol of the negative aspect of the universe, representing the Gnos-tic view that evil is not only on the periphery of the Wheel of Transformationsbut in its very centre—that is, in its Origin.Cock As the bird of dawn, the cock is a sun-symbol (4), and an emblem ofvigilance and activity. Immolated to Priapus and Aesculapius, it was supposed tocure the sick (8). During the Middle Ages it became a highly important Christianimage, nearly always appearing on the highest weathervane, on cathedral towers"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"COFFER52and domes, and was regarded as an allegory of vigilance and resurrection. Davycomments that vigilance in this context must be taken in the sense of ‘tendingtowards eternity and taking care to grant first place to the things of the spirit, tobe wakeful and to greet the Sun—Christ—even before it rises in the East’—illumination (14).Coffer Like all objects whose essential quality is that of containing, itsometimes acquires the symbolic character of a heart, the brain or the maternalwomb. The heart, the first of these meanings, is a figure characteristic of thesymbolism of Romanesque art (14). In a broader sense, receptacles which can beclosed up have, from the earliest times, represented all things that may holdsecrets, such as the Ark of the Covenant of the Hebrews, or Pandora’s box (48).Cold In Bachelard’s opinion, supported by literary analysis, cold corre-sponds symbolically to being in the situation of, or longing for, solitude or exal-tation. Nietzsche, in his Human, All Too Human, makes a call for ‘the cold, wildAlpine lands scarce warmed by the Autumn sun and loveless’. ‘Thanks to thecold, the air gains in attacking virtues, it becomes spiritualized and dehumanized.In the frozen atmosphere, at higher altitudes, one finds another Nietzscheanquality: silence’ (1).Colour Colour symbolism is one of the most universal of all types ofsymbolism, and has been consciously used in the liturgy, in heraldry, alchemy, artand literature. There are a great many considerations bearing upon the meaning ofcolour which we can here do little more than summarize. To begin with, there isthe superficial classification suggested by optics and experimental psychology.The first group embraces warm ‘advancing’ colours, corresponding to processesof assimilation, activity and intensity (red, orange, yellow and, by extension,white), and the second covers cold, ‘retreating’ colours, corresponding to pro-cesses of dissimilation, passivity and debilitation (blue, indigo, violet and, byextension, black), green being an intermediate, transitional colour spanning thetwo groups. Then there are the subtle uses to which colour may be put in em-blematic designs. The serial order of the colour-range is basic, comprising as itdoes (though in a somewhat abstract sense) a kind of limited set of definitive,distinct and ordered colours. The formal affinity between, on the one hand, thisseries of six or seven shades of colour—for sometimes it is difficult to tell bluefrom indigo, or azure from ultramarine—and, on the other hand, the vowel-series—there being seven vowels in Greek—as well as the notes of the musicalscale, points to a basic analogy between these three scales and also between themand the division of the heavens, according to ancient astrobiological thought, intoseven parts (although in fact there were sometimes said to be nine). Colour-"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"COLOUR53symbolism usually derives from one of the following sources: (1) the inherentcharacteristic of each colour, perceived intuitively as objective fact; (2) the rela-tionship between a colour and the planetary symbol traditionally linked with it;or (3) the relationship which elementary, primitive logic perceives. Modern psy-chology and psychoanalysis seem to place more weight upon the third of theseformulas than even upon the first (the second formula acting as a bridge betweenthe other two). Thus, Jolan de Jacobi, in her study of Jungian psychology, saysin so many words: ‘The correspondence of the colours to the respective func-tions varies with different cultures and groups and even among individuals; as ageneral rule, however, . . . blue, the colour of the rarefied atmosphere, of the clearsky, stands for thinking; yellow, the colour of the far-seeing sun, which appearsbringing light out of an inscrutable darkness only to disappear again into thedarkness, for intuition, the function which grasps as in a flash of illumination theorigins and tendencies of happenings; red, the colour of the pulsing blood and offire, for the surging and tearing emotions; while green, the colour of earthly,tangible, immediately perceptible growing things, represents the function of sen-sation’ (30). The most important of the symbols derived from the foregoingprinciples are these: red is associated with blood, wounds, death-throes andsublimation; orange with fire and flames; yellow with the light of the sun, illumi-nation, dissemination and comprehensive generalization; green with vegetation,but also with death and lividness (green is therefore the connecting-link betweenblack—mineral life—and red—blood and animal life—as well as between animallife and discomposition and death); light blue with the sky and the day, and withthe calm sea; dark blue with the sky and the night, and with the stormy sea; brownand ochre with the earth; and black with the fertilized land. Gold corresponds tothe mystic aspect of the sun; silver to that of the moon. The different conclusionsreached by psychologists and by traditional, esoteric thinkers, apparent in theabove summaries, can be explained by the fact that in the psychologists’ view,symbolic impressions formed in the mind may be merely fortuitous, whereasaccording to esoteric theory, the three series (of shades of colour, of componentelements and natural appearances, and of feelings and reactions) are the outcomeof a single, simultaneous cause working at the deepest levels of reality. It is forthis reason that Ely Star, and others, maintains that the seven colours are sever-ally analogous to the seven faculties of the soul, to the seven virtues (from apositive point of view), to the seven vices (from a negative viewpoint), to thegeometric forms, the days of the week and the seven planets (55). Actually this isa concept which pertains more to the ‘theory of correspondences’ than to thesymbolism of colour proper. Many primitive peoples intuitively sense that close"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"COLOUR54links exist between all the different aspects of the real world: the Zuni Indians ofWestern America, for example, make a yearly offering to their priests of ‘corn ofseven colours’, each colour pertaining to a planetary god. Nevertheless, it isworth while bearing in mind the most essential of these correspondences. Forexample: fire is represented by red and orange; air by yellow; both green andviolet represent water; and black or ochre represent earth. Time is usually sym-bolized by a sheen as of shot silk. About the various shades of blue, ranging fromnear black to clear sapphire, there has been a great deal of speculation. The mostrelevant comments in our opinion are the following: ‘Blue, standing for the verti-cal’—and the spatial, or the symbolism of levels—’means height and depth (theblue sky above, the blue sea below)’ (32). ‘Colour symbolizes an upward-tendingforce in the pattern of dark (or gloom and evil) and light (or illumination, glory andgood). Thus, dark blue is grouped with black, and azure, like pure yellow, iscoupled with white’ (14). ‘Blue is darkness made visible.’ Blue, between whiteand black (that is, day and night) indicates an equilibrium which ‘varies with thetone’ (3). The belief that colours may be grouped in respect of their basic essen-tials, and within the general tendency to place phenomena in antithetical groups,according to whether they are of positive value (associated with light) or ofnegative (linked with darkness), is echoed even in present-day aesthetics, whichbases the colour-system not upon the three primary colours of red, yellow andblue but upon the implied antithesis of yellow (or white) and blue (or black),taking red as the indirect transition between these two colours (the stages being:yellow, orange, red, violet, blue) and green as the direct (or summational) transi-tion, this being the view of Kandinsky and Herbin. To sum up, those interpreta-tions of colour symbolism which in our view have most importance: blue (theattribute of Jupiter and Juno as god and goddess of heaven) (56) stands forreligious feeling, devotion and innocence (59); green (the colour pertaining toVenus and Nature) betokens the fertility of the fields (56), sympathy and adapt-ability (59); violet represents nostalgia and memories, because it is made up fromblue (signifying devotion) and red (passion) (59); yellow (the attribute of Apollo,the sun-god) indicates magnanimity, intuition and intellect (56, 59); orange, prideand ambition (56, 59); red (the attribute of Mars), passion, sentiment and the life-giving principle (56, 59); grey, neutralization, egoism, depression, inertia andindifference—meanings derived from the colour of ashes (56, 59); purple (thecolour of the imperial Roman paludament, as well as the Cardinal’s) provides asynthesis comparable with, yet the inverse of, violet, representing power, spiri-tuality and sublimation (56, 59); pink (the colour of the flesh), sensuality and theemotions (56, 59). One could go on with such interpretations ad infinitum, giving"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"COLOUR55more and more exact meanings to more and more precise shades of colour, but todo so would be to fall into one of the traps of symbolism, that is, the temptationto evolve a hard-and-fast system of allegories. It is important, nevertheless, tobear in mind the analogy between the tone (that is, the intensity of a colour, or thedegree of its brightness—its place on the scale between the opposite poles ofblack and white) and its corresponding level-symbolism. It must also be borne inmind that the purity of a colour will always have its counterpart in the purity ofits symbolic meaning. Similarly, the primary colours will correspond to the pri-mary emotions, whilst the secondary or tertiary colours will express symbols oflike complexity. Children instinctively reject all mixed or impure colours, becausethey mean nothing to them. Conversely, the art of very advanced and refinedcultures has always thrived upon subtle tones of yellowish mauve, near-violetpink, greenish ochres, etc. Let us now consider some of the practical applicationsof colour-symbolism, by way of clarification of the above. According to Beau-mont, colour has a very special significance in Chinese symbolism, for it isemblematic of rank and authority; yellow for instance, because of its associationwith the sun, is considered the sacred privilege of the royal family (5). For theEgyptians, blue was used to represent truth (4). Green predominates in Christianart because of its value as a bridge between the two colour-groups (37). Themother goddess of India is represented as red in colour (contrary to the usualsymbolism of white as the feminine colour), because she is associated with theprinciple of creation and red is the colour of activity per se (60). It is also thecolour of blood, and for this reason prehistoric man would stain with blood anyobject which he wished to bring to life; and the Chinese use red pennons astalismans (39). It is for this reason too that when a Roman general was received intriumph he was carried in a chariot drawn by four white horses which were cladin gilt armour (as a symbol of the sun), and his face was painted red. Schneider,considering the essential bearing of the colour red upon alchemic processes, con-cludes that it is to be related to fire and purification (51). Interesting evidence ofthe ominous and tragic character of orange—a colour which in the view of OswaldWirth is actually a symbol for flames, ferocity, cruelty and egoism—is forthcom-ing in the following passage taken from Heinrich Zimmer, the orientalist: ‘Afterthe Future Buddha had severed his hair and exchanged his royal garments for theorange-yellow robe of the ascetic beggar (those outside the pale of human societyvoluntarily adopt the orange-yellow garment that was originally the covering ofcondemned criminals being led to the place of execution) . . .’ (60). To wind upthese observations upon the psychic significance of colour, let us point to somecorrespondences with alchemy. The three main phases of the ‘Great Work’ (a"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"COLOUR (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE)56symbol of spiritual evolution) were (1) prime matter (corresponding to black),(2) mercury (white) and (3) sulphur (red), culminating in the production of the‘stone’ (gold). Black pertains to the state of fermentation, putrefaction, occulta-tion and penitence; white to that of illumination, ascension, revelation and par-don; red to that of suffering, sublimation and love. And gold is the state of glory.So that the series black—white—red—gold, denotes the path of spiritual ascen-sion. The opposite or descending series can be seen in the scale beginning withyellow (that is, gold in the negative sense of the point of departure or emanationrather than the point of arrival), blue (or heaven), green (nature, or immediatenatural life), black (that is, in the sense of the neoplatonic ‘fall’) (33). In sometraditions, green and black are seen as a composite expression of vegetationmanure. Hence, the ascending series of green—white—red, formed the favouritesymbol of the Egyptians and the Celtic druids (54, 21). René Guénon also pointsto the significant fact that Dante, who knew his traditional symbology, has Beatriceappear in clothes coloured green, white and red, expressive of hope, faith andcharity and corresponding to the three (alchemic) planes which we have alreadymentioned (27). The complex symbolism of mixed colours is derived from theprimary colours of which they are composed. So, for example, greys and ochresare related to earth and vegetation. It is impossible to give any idea here of all themany notions which may be derived from a primal meaning. Thus, the Gnosticsevolved the idea that, since pink was the colour of flesh-tints, it was also thecolour of resurrection. To come back to the colour orange, the beautiful explana-tion of some allegorical figures in the alchemic Abraham the Jew contains a refer-ence to orange as the ‘colour of desperation’, and goes on: ‘A man and a womancoloured orange and seen against the background of a field coloured sky-blue,signifies that they must not place their hopes in this world, for orange denotesdesperation and the blue background is a sign of hope in heaven.’ And finally, torevert to green, this is a colour of antithetical tendencies: it is the colour ofvegetation (or of life, in other words) and of corpses (or of death); hence, theEgyptians painted Osiris (the god of vegetation and of the dead) green. Similarly,green takes the middle place in the everyday scale of colours.Colour (Positive/Negative) The conception of black and white as diametri-cally opposed symbols of the positive and the negative, either in simultaneous, insuccessive or alternating opposition, is very common. In our opinion it is of theutmost importance. Like all dual formulae in symbolism, it is related to thenumber two and the great myth of the Gemini. But some of its particular appli-cations are of great interest; let us begin, for example, with the two sphinxesdepicted in the seventh enigma of the Tarot pack. Here, one sphinx is white and"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"COLOUR (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE)57the other black (59). Again: there is a Catalan tale which relates how some black-birds which grew up near a magic waterfall had snowy-white breasts, resemblingthe habits of Sisters of Charity (10). In many primitive rites—medicinal dances,for example—the dancers dress up in white clothes and blacken their faces (51).The opposition of the two worlds (the subject of the Gemini-symbol) finds itsexpression in Indo-Aryan mythology in the portrayal of one white and one blackhorse (50). The ‘water-maidens’ of Hispanic folklore wear white rings on thefingers of their right hand and on their left wrist a gold, black-banded bracelet (10).In Tibet, there are rites in which a man is chosen as the sacrificial victim, and hisface is painted half white and half black (21). Jung recounts a dream of a man whosaw himself as the pupil of a white magician clothed in black who instructed himup to a certain point beyond which—he was told in his dream—he would have tobe taught by a black magician dressed in white (34). Struggles between black andwhite knights occur often in legends and folktales. There is a Persian song whichtells how a black knight defends a castle against a white knight who fights val-iantly to reach the treasure within. Grimm has a myth of Lower Saxony whichillustrates the cosmic combat between the positive and the negative principles. InJung’s version (31), it reads as follows: ‘There was once a young ash-tree thatgrew unnoticed in a wood. Each New Year’s Eve a white knight riding upon awhite horse comes to cut down the young shoot. At the same time a black knightarrives and engages him in combat. After a lengthy battle the white knight over-comes the black knight and cuts down the tree. But one day the white knight willbe unsuccessful, then the ash will grow, and when it is big enough for a horse to betethered under it, a mighty king will come and a tremendous battle will begin’(implying the destruction of time and the world). Black, in fairly generalizedterms, seems to represent the initial, germinal stage of all processes, as it does inalchemy. In this connexion, Blavatsky points out that Noah released a black crowfrom the ark before he sent out the white dove. Black crows, black doves andblack flames figure in a great many legends. They are all symbols closely relatedto the primal (black, occult or unconscious) wisdom which stems from the Hid-den Source (9). Here, Jung points to the relevance of the ‘dark night’ of St. Johnof the Cross and the ‘germination in darkness’ of the alchemists’ nigredo. Let usremember too that darkness for both Victor Hugo and Richard Wagner signifiesthe maternal, and that light appearing out of the gloom represents a kind ofcrystallization (33). Jung also points out in this connexion that carbon—thepredominant chemical component in Man’s organism—is black in so far as it ischarcoal or graphite, but that, in so far as it is a diamond (that is, crystallizedcarbon), it is ‘crystal-clear water’ (32), thus underlining the fact that the"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"COLOUR (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE)58profoundest meaning of black is occultation and germination in darkness (32). Inthis he is supported by Guénon, who maintains that black stands for all prelimi-nary stages, representing the ‘descent into hell’, which is a recapitulation of (or anatonement for) all the preceding phases (29). Thus, the dark earth-mother—theDiana of Ephesus—was depicted with black hands and face, recalling the blackopenings of caves and grottos (56). This may also, of course, be concerned witha black woman, such as the one who appears in the Welsh tale of Peredur (Parsifal),implying the same sense of inferiority as in the case of the black man or the‘ethiops’. Amongst primitive peoples, black is the colour associated with inner orsubterranean zones (9, 21). Black also sometimes comes to symbolize time (60),in contrast to white which represents timelessness and ecstasy. The function ofwhite is derived from that of the sun: from mystic illumination—symbolically ofthe East; when it is regarded as purified yellow (that is, when it stands in the samerelation to yellow as does black to the blue of the deep sea), it comes to signifyintuition in general, and, in its affirmative and spiritual aspect, intuition of theBeyond. That is why the sacred horses of Greek, Roman, Celtic and Germaniccultures were white. Even today, in Dithmarschen in the south of Jutland, somepeople still recall the Schimmelreiter, a knight who would ride up on a whitehorse when the sea-dykes burst and a catastrophe threatened. Most of the wordscontaining the root alb—Alberich, the alb-king or elf-king, the river Elbe, theAlps—allude to this shining light of the supernatural (16). According to Guénon,in Le Roi du Monde, the colour white represents the spiritual centre, Tula (Thule),the so-called ‘white island’, which, in India, is identified with the ‘land of theliving’ or paradise. This is the same as mount Meru. Guénon believes that it alsoexplains the etymology of the many geographical names containing albo (AlbaLonga, the original city of Rome; Albion, Albano, Albany, Albania, etc.). In Greek,Argos has a similar meaning; and from it is derived argentum, silver-white. Nev-ertheless, the colour white, symbolically, does not relate to silver but to gold.Conversely, white, in so far as its negative quality of lividness goes, is (like greenand greenish yellow) symbolic also of death (50) and the moon, the latter beingthe symbolic source of a number of rites and customs. Eliade mentions moonlightdances performed by women with faces painted white (17). This principle ofantithetical dualism is illustrated in a great number of allegories and symbols. Thenight, as the mother of all things, has been portrayed with a veil of stars, carryingtwo children in her arms, one white and the other black (4). Very common inSlavonic myth were Bielbog and Chernobog, the white and the black god respec-tively (35), closely related to the Gemini. The Ouroboros of the Codex Marcianus(of the 2nd century A.D.) has its top half black and the lower white; this inversion"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"COLOUR (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE)59of the expected order imparts a sense of cyclic movement to the figure, furtheremphasized by the circular impulse suggested by the fact of its biting its tail. It iseasy to recognize the bearing this has upon the binary symbol of the ChineseYang-Yin, and indeed upon every system of graphic symbolism based upon op-posites (32). This, then, is a question of an inversion-symbol—one of the basicstrands in traditional symbolism—which helps to explain the ceaseless alterna-tions of life/death, light/darkness and appearance/disappearance which make pos-sible the continued existence of phenomena. There is a beautiful, double, complexsymbol in the Rigveda (III, 7, 3) which well illustrates this dynamic, alternatingdualism: fire, although clear and bright in the sky (or the air), leaves black traceson earth (that is a charred object). Rain, although black in the sky (as rain-clouds),becomes clear on earth (50). This weaving and unravelling of the strands of all thepairs of opposites is precisely the import of the positive/negative aspects ofwhite/black, which we have sought to explain above. The Gemini, a symbol of thenecessity of nature to transmute itself into binary and contradictory aspects, isrepresented by both white and black (51). But mankind has groped towards away out of the terrible circle divided into two sections by a sigmoid line (such asthat symbolized by the Yang-Yin) and this way is that indicated by the axis white/red or red/gold. Here we would again recall that the ascending scale of colours isblack—white—red. Loeffler, in his examination of mythic birds in legend, linksthose which are black with inspiration of the mind, those which are white witheroticism and those which are red with the supernatural. We would also empha-size that in symbolism of mediaeval Christian art, black stands for penitence,white for purity and red for charity and love. Through love, then, man can find theway out of the closed, double circle. Pinedo recounts that St. Bernard’s mother,while she was pregnant, dreamed of a white dog with a red back. A similar case tothis is that of Blessed Juana of Aza, the mother of St. Dominic Guzman, whowent on a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Dominic of Silos to beg of him the favourof a son. The saint appeared to her and promised her that her wish would begranted, and she looked down and saw at her feet a white dog with a flaming torchin its mouth (46). In alchemy, white/red is the conjunction of opposites, or theconiunctio solis et lunae. Two-headed eagles and representations of the Rebis (ahuman-being with two heads) are usually coloured white and red, signifying thesublimation of the black/white antithesis. Also characteristic of alchemy is thecurious white and red rose, symbolizing the union of water with fire. ‘My be-loved is white and ruddy’, so sings the Song of Songs (v. 10), and the lily and therose are essential symbols of white and red implicit in all mystic thought (46).When two colours are contrasted in a given symbolic field, the inferior colour is"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"COLUMN60feminine in character and the superior is masculine. By ‘inferior’ we mean thatwhich is lower within the alchemic order or series, which runs as follows: yellow,blue, green, black, white, red, gold. So, to take the black/white relationship, blackis inferior and feminine; or, in the case of red/gold, gold is superior and masculine(or celestial, as against the terrestrial implications of the feminine principle). Anysymbolic composition that, spatially, does not conform with this order presentsus with a clear-cut example of Symbolic Inversion (q.v.). For example, in thenormal symbolic pattern, white will be placed above black, red above white, andso on.Column The single column pertains to the cosmic group of symbols repre-senting the ‘world-axis’ (such as the tree, the ladder, the sacrificial stake, the mast,the cross), but also it may have a merely endopathic sense deriving from itsvertical nature, implying an upward impulse of self-affirmation. Of course, thereis a phallic implication too; for this reason, the ancients ascribed a column and adolphin to Ceres as emblems of love and the sea respectively (8). The isolatedcolumn is, in short, as closely related to the symbolic tree as to the ritual erectionof the megalithic stone or menhir. In allegories and graphic symbols there arenearly always two columns, not one. When they are situated on either side of ashield, they are equivalent to supporters, representing the balanced tension ofopposing forces. They have a similar significance when they act as the supportsof a lintel. In a cosmic sense, the two pillars or columns are symbolic of eternalstability, and the space between them is the entrance to eternity. They also alludeto Solomon’s temple (the image of the absolute and essential principles of build-ing) (4). Variants of this symbol—or rather of its significance—are to be found inesoteric thought; nearly all of them are the result of applying the symbolism ofthe number two to the dual columns. Taking them as separate symbols, the twounits making up the number two are different in kind. For the first unit corre-sponds to the masculine, affirmative and evolutive principle, whereas the secondrepresents the feminine, negative, passive or involutive. It is for this reason thatSaunier gives the particular significance of the two columns rising up at theentrance to temples as that of evolution and involution, or of good and evil(comparable with the Tree of Life and the Tree of Death—or Knowledge—in theGarden of Eden). On occasion, this abstract duality goes hand in hand with thephysical duality of the material; thus, in the legendary temple of Hercules atTyre, one of the columns was made of gold and the other of a semi-precious stone(49). In Hebrew tradition, the two columns are known as Mercy and Severity (9).To return now to the single column, we cannot fail to see in it a projection of—oran analogous correspondence with—the spinal column; the same kind of corre-"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"CONJUNCTION61spondence is to be seen in all forms of bilateral symmetry in art, as well as in suchorgans of the human body as the kidneys or the lungs. The vertebral column maybe equated also with the worldaxis, in the same way as the skull-image is equatedwith the sky, within the general relationship of the microcosm and the macro-cosm.Comb According to Schneider the relationship between the comb and the(rowing-) boat is so close that both symbols seem to merge in a way that issuggestive of the reconciliation of fire and water (19). Since the comb is theattribute of some fabulous, female beings, such as lamias and sirens, there is inconsequence a relationship between it and the fleshless tail of the fish, in turnsignifying burials (or the symbolism of sacrificial remains—for instance thebucraneum—or of devouring).Compasses An emblematic representation of the act of creation (37), foundin allegories of geometry, architecture and equity (8). By its shape, it is related tothe letter A, signifying the beginning of all things (4). It also symbolizes thepower of measurement, of delimitation.Concord Concord expresses conformity, reconciliation and harmony in di-versity, or the state of peace reached between beings or between the variousforces and urges of being; its symbol is the linking of hands or arms, an embrace,or interlacing lines. It is an essential concept in the Psychomachia (the Struggle ofthe Soul) by the Hispanic Latin poet Aurelius Prudentius Clemens (348-410),author also of the Peristephanon (the Book of Crowns). On the other hand, theanalogy between the pairs: consonance—dissonance and concord—discord, isevident. For that reason, dissonance intensifies all warlike expressions in music,as in Varèse’s Arcana.Cone The symbolic significance of the cone is very complex and may bederived from the association of the circle with the triangle. In Byblus it was asymbol of Astarte, but in various parts of Syria, according to Frazer, it wassymbolic of the sun—further indication that it can be given no precise meaning. Itcan also be taken as a symbol deriving from the pyramid (21); it would thensignify psychic Oneness.Conjunction A great many symbols touch upon the great myth of coniunctioor unification, representing the coincidentia oppositorum and, more particularly,the reconciliation of the separate sexes in an eternal synthesis, after the platoniclegend. In Jungian psychology, this conjunction has a purely psychological mean-ing within the psyche of one individual, as a counterpart of and a substitute forthe synthesis achieved through platonic love between two different beings. Mys-tic longing has its being in the profound yearning for absolute unity of all that is"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"CONSTELLATION62particularized and separate. In conjunction, then, lies the only possibility ofsupreme peace and rest. The union of heaven and earth in primitive, astrobiologi-cal religions is a symbol of conjunction, as is also the legendary marriage of theprincess with the prince who has rescued her (33, 38).Constellation In Chinese symbolism, it is the third Element. The first is theactive, bright force called Yang, and the second the passive, dark force called Yin.The constellation signifies the connexion between the Upper and the LowerWorlds, or what binds together all that is different. It is one of the imperialemblems (5).Coral Coral is the aquatic tree. It therefore partakes of and blends togetherthe symbolism on the one hand of the tree as the world-axis, and on the other thatof the (lower) ocean or abyss. Hence, it may be equated with the roots of theterrestrial tree. On the other hand, being red in colour, it is also related to blood;hence it has, besides its abyssal connotation, a visceral significance which is wellcaptured in alchemic symbolism (8). According to Greek legend, coral grew out ofthe drops of blood of the Gorgon Medusa.Cornucopia In mythology, it was the goat Amalthea who fed the infantJupiter with milk. Given that the general symbolism of the horn is strength, andthat the goat has maternal implications, and in addition that the shape of the horn(phallic outside and hollow inside) endows it with a complex symbolism (includ-ing that of the lingam, or symbol of generation), it is easy to understand itsallegorical use as the horn of abundance. Piobb points out also that the cornucopiais an expression of prosperity deriving from its association with the zodiacal signof Capricorn (48).Correspondences The theory of ‘correspondences’ is basic to symbolisttradition. The implications and scope of this theory are beyond measure, and anyvalid study into the ultimate nature of the universe must take it into account. Buthere we can give little more than a brief idea of its scope, with some particularinstances. It is founded upon the assumption that all cosmic phenomena arelimited and serial and that they appear as scales or series on separate planes; butthis condition is neither chaotic nor neutral, for the components of one series arelinked with those of another in their essence and in their ultimate significance. Itis possible to marshal correspondences by forcing the components of any givenscale or scales into a common numerical pattern: for example, it is not difficult toadapt the colour-scale from seven to eight colours, should one wish to equate itwith the scale of temperaments laid down by modern character-study, or, for thatmatter, to reduce it from seven to six colours for some other comparable reason."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"CORRESPONDENCES63But it is always preferable to make sure of the correspondences which exist(apparently) only in part between different patterns, rather than to force theminto unnatural moulds. The attributes of the ancient gods were really nothing lessthan unformulated correspondences: Venus, for example, was felt to correspondwith the rose, the shell, the dove, the apple, the girdle and the myrtle. There isalso a psychological basis for the theory of correspondences, related to synaes-thesia. Louis-Claude de St. Martin comments in his L’Homme du désir: ‘Thingswere not as they are in our gloomy dwelling, where sounds can be likened only toother sounds, colours to other colours, one substance to another; there everythingwas of a kind. Light gave out sounds, melody brought forth light, colours hadmovement because they were alive; objects were at once sonorous, diaphanousand mobile enough to intermix and flow in a line through all space’ (3). In Schneider’sview, the key to all systems of correspondences is music. He points to a treatiseby Sârngadeva in the Indian Samgîta Ratnâkara (I, iii, 48) of the 13th centurywhich expounds the mystic relationship between music and animals. He com-ments that nothing similar is to be found in the West, although he suggests that thecapitals of San Cugat del Vallés and those at Gerona (of the 12th century) portraya series of animals which, being disposed in a kind of scale, are somewhat compa-rable. He points likewise to Jakob Böhme and Athanasius Kircher, both of whomsought to incorporate all these ideas into their systems of mystic correspon-dences (Musurgia universalis) (50). Ely Star offers a somewhat crude explana-tion of correspondences: ‘Each of the colours of the prism is analogous to one ofthe seven faculties of the human soul, to the seven virtues and the seven vices, togeometric forms and to the planets, etc.’ (55). Clearly there are certain correspon-dences of meaning and situation in the physical world itself. For example, soundis the more shrill (or higher) the faster it moves, and vice versa; hence, speedcorresponds to height and slowness to lowness, within a binary system. If coldcolours are retrogressive, then coldness corresponds to distance, and warmth tonearness; here, then, we have another scientifically demonstrable correspondence.Taking the septenary system, Star suggests some correspondences between coloursand musical notes, which we find exact enough: violet (the leading-note); red (thetonic); orange (the super-tonic); yellow (the mediant); green (the sub-dominant);blue (the dominant); indigo (the sub-mediant) (54). The Greeks, the Cabbalistsand the Gnostics founded a great deal of their philosophy upon the theory ofcorrespondences. Porphyry mentions the following, between the Greek vowelsand the planets: alpha corresponding to the moon; epsilon to Mercury; eta toVenus; iota to the sun; omicron to Mars; upsilon to Jupiter; and omega to Saturn."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"COSMOGONY64Again: within the novenary system, he underlines the significance of the Hindutheory of ‘modes’, that is: the erotic, heroic, odious, furious, terrible, pathetic,marvellous, agreeable, humorous. The symbolism of plants, scents and animals isoften based upon the theory of correspondences or derivations of it. To mentiona few: the oak (by association with the sun), the walnut (with the moon), the olivetree (with Mercury), the pine (with Saturn); the correspondence may range fromthe most obvious (such as that of the oak allied with strength, or the palm treewith victory) to the less obvious (47). Among the most important of systems ofcorrespondences is the Zodiac; corresponding to the twelve signs of the Zodiac,one finds the months of the year, the tribes of Israel, the labours of Hercules, andthe colour-scale adapted to include twelve colours. Vital also is that relating to theparts of the human body: Aries (corresponding to the head), Taurus (the neck andthroat), the Gemini (the shoulders and arms), Cancer (the chest and stomach),Leo (the heart, lungs and liver), Virgo (the belly and intestines), Libra (the back-bone and marrow), Scorpio (the kidneys and genitals), Sagittarius (the thighs),Capricorn (the knees), Aquarius (the legs) and Pisces (the feet) (54). The first sixsigns form an involutive series which corresponds to the ‘descending’ colour-series of the alchemists, that is, from yellow, through blue and green, down toblack. The evolutive series corresponds to the ‘ascending’ metamorphosis fromblack, through white and red, up to gold. Schneider, who has made a very usefulstudy of correspondences, refers to Alberuni’s The Book of Instructions in theElements of the Art of Astrology, 1934, where the author relates the signs of theZodiac with the principal elements of landscape: Aries corresponds to the desert,Taurus to the plains, the Gemini to twin mountain-peaks, Cancer to parks, riversand trees, Leo to a mountain with castles and palaces, Virgo to the homestead,Scorpio to prisons and caves, Sagittarius to quicksands and centres of magic,Capricorn to fortresses and castles, Aquarius to caverns and sewers, Pisces totombs (50). Piobb has also shown that there are correspondences between thesigns of the Zodiac and the processes of the alchemists (48).Cosmogony The basis of most cosmogonies is the ‘cosmic sacrifice’, ex-pressing the idea that the creation of forms and matter can take place only bymodifying primordial energy. Such a modification, so far as most primitive andprotohistoric peoples are concerned, was seen to exist in such painful forms asmutilation, struggle or sacrifice. In Babylonian cosmogony it assumed the form ofthe killing of the original mother Tiamat (the dragon), whose body was used in thecreation of heaven and earth (31). Hindu tradition links the struggle of the godswith a tribe of devils called Asuras, or with monsters of some other kind. Accord-"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"COW65ing to the Rigveda, the gods would sacrifice a primeval being—the giant Purusha.In Persia it was a bull which was sacrificed by Ahriman or Mithras. In Scandinaviait was the giant Ymir who was dismembered by the Aesir gods and then used asthe material for the creation of the world (35). Clearly, then, these cosmogonieshave a psychological implication because they express the central idea that thereis no creation without sacrifice, no life without death (this being the basis of allinversion-symbolisms and of the Gemini). Here we have the origin of all thebloody sacrifices of the world’s religions. It is to the Chinese writer Huai-nan-tzuthat we owe a more advanced cosmogony which, while incorporating certain ofthe above ideas, takes its inspiration mainly from the conception of the cosmos asa new order imposed upon primigenial chaos. Here is Wilhelm’s version of thisinteresting passage of Huai-nan-tzu (58): ‘The collapse of heaven had still takenno definite form. It was floating and swimming and was known as the great light.When the Sense began in the empty chaos of clouds, the cloud-chaos engenderedspace and time. Space and time engendered force. Force had fixed limits. The pureand clear floated upwards and formed heaven. The heavy and the muddy coagu-lated below to form earth. . . . The seed of heaven and earth is the union of the clearand the obscure. The concentrated seeds of the obscure and the clear are the fourseasons. The scattered seeds of the four seasons is the quantity of things. Theheat-force of the clear, when concentrated, engenders fire. The seed of fiery forceis the sun. The cold strength of the dark, when concentrated, is water. The seed ofwater is the moon. . . . The path of heaven is round. The path of the earth issquare. The essence of the round is the clear.’ Every eschatological process is apartial regeneration of the universe, partaking of the cosmogonic and hence of thesacrificial. Similarly, it is not possible to transform the human soul in any way,except through sacrifice.Cow Associated with the earth and with the moon. A great many lunargoddesses wear the horns of a cow on their head. When linked with the primigenialgoddess Neith, the cow is a mother-symbol, representing the primal principle ofhumidity and endowed with certain androgynous—or gynandrous, rather—char-acteristics (31). In Egypt it was linked with the idea of vital heat (39). Va c, thefeminine aspect of Brahma, is known as the ‘melodious Cow’ and as the ‘Cow ofabundance’, the first description stemming from the idea of the world’s creationout of sound, while the second—as hardly needs be said—comes from its func-tion of nourishing the world with its milk, the fine dust of the Milky Way. In thiswe can see also the idea of heaven as a fecundating bull, with its sex in verted; in"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"CRANE66Hindu belief, the bull and the cow represent the active and the passive aspects ofthe generating forces of the universe (40).Crane In cultures ranging from the Chinese to those of the Mediterranean,the crane is an allegory of justice, longevity and the good and diligent soul (51).Creation In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphics, the whole process ofcreation is expressed by four signs: the spiral, as the symbol of cosmic energy; thesquared spiral, as the symbol of the workings of this energy within the heart ofmatter; a formless mass, of self-evident meaning; and the square, as a symbol oforganized matter (19). There is, then, a duality of the greatest theoretical impor-tance—two paths: that by which abstract energy develops towards energy as anorganizing force, and that followed by pure matter towards a state of matter ruledby a given order. Here lies the explanation of the process of all creation in its twomost essential aspects: that of energy-content, and that of material form.Cremation Death at the stake, the consummation of sacrifice through fire,and, from the mystic point of view, any kind of cremation, are all symbols ofsublimation, that is, of the destruction of what is base to make way for what issuperior; or, in other words, salvation of and through the spirit. This is thesignificance of the self-sacrifice of Hercules. It was a very common symbolamong the alchemists. For example, the 24th emblem in Michael Maier’s ScrutiniumChymicum (1687) shows a wolf—representing prime matter—burning in thefurnace (32).Crescent There is a dual significance to this symbol. In so far as it pertainsto the moon, it stands for the world of changing forms or of phenomena, for thepassive, feminine principle, and for things aquatic. Secondly, in mediaeval em-blems of the Western world, and especially when associated with a star, it is asymbolic image of paradise (4).Crest Because of its position on the helmet (linked symbolically with thehead), the crest clearly stands for thought, and comes to be a symbol of thepredominating theme—the leitmotiv—of the knight, which he displays as a tokenof his beloved (that is, his anima) and so giving tangible expression to his adven-tures and his combats. The encaged bird of Walter von der Vogelweide (of the 13thcentury) is probably an emblem of a soul yearning to fly away in freedom.Crisis Man tends to question his destiny mostly in moments of crisis, thatis, when the stream of life (either the stream within him of his feelings andpassions, his abnormal urges or sense of inadequacy, or that flowing outsidehim—the flood of obstacles and failures in communication) goes against him orcarries him along farther than he would wish. There is, then, a primordial desire inMan to experience ‘inversion’, that is, to find the technique whereby everything"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"CRONOS67of a kind can be transmuted into its opposite. So, for example, illness invertedbecomes health, hate becomes love, loneliness company, ignorance wisdom, dis-sension solidarity, rancour forgiveness, sadness happiness, the enemy’s victoryturns to rout and drought to fertility. Such inversion at first appears as a cross-roads, that is, as a potentiality. Then it takes the form of symbols of sacrifice,expressing the latent—and valid—idea that in every negative situation there is adirect or an indirect sense of guilt. Then, finally, come the symbols of Inversionproper and of rebirth.Crocodile Two basically different aspects of the crocodile are blended in itssymbolic meaning, representing the influence upon the animal of two of the fourElements. In the first place, because of its viciousness and destructive power, thecrocodile came to signify fury and evil in Egyptian hieroglyphics (19); in thesecond place, since it inhabits a realm intermediate between earth and water, andis associated with mud and vegetation, it came to be thought of as an emblem offecundity and power (50). In the opinion of Mertens Stienon there is a thirdaspect, deriving from its resemblance to the dragon and the serpent, as a symbolof knowledge. In Egypt, the dead used to be portrayed transformed into croco-diles of knowledge, an idea which is linked with that of the zodiacal sign ofCapricorn. Blavatsky compares the crocodile with the Kumara of India (40).Then, finally, come the symbols of Inversion proper and of rebirth.Cromlech It corresponds to the general symbolism of stone-monuments andis related to fertility cults. Eliade mentions that, in popular European beliefs eventoday, there are remnants of the ancient faith in the powers of large stones. Thespace between these rocks or stones, or the holes in the stones themselves,played an important part in fertility and health rites. The cromlech is regarded asa symbol of the Great Mother, whereas the menhir is clearly masculine (17).Cronos By Cronos we mean here not so much the general symbolism ofSaturn as those images of time which originated in oriental thought, and whichwere so common in the Lower Roman Empire. He is sometimes portrayed withfour wings, two of which are outspread as if he were about to take flight, and twoare lowered as if he were resting; this is an allusion to the dualism of time: thepassage of time, and ecstasy (or transport beyond time). Sometimes he was alsodepicted with four eyes, two in front and two behind; this is a representation ofsimultaneity and of the position of the Present between the Past and the Future,a symbolism comparable with the two faces of Janus (8). More characteristic ofthe general symbolic meaning is the ‘Mithraic Cronos’, a deity representinginfinite time, derived from the Zervan Akarana of the Persians. He has a rigid,human figure, and sometimes is bi-somatic: a human body with the head of a lion."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"CROOK68But when the head is human, then the lion’s head is located on the breast. Thetrunk is enclosed in the five folds of an enormous snake—again denoting theduality of time: the passage of time intertwining with eternity—which, accordingto Macrobius, represents the path of the god along the celestial ecliptic. The lion,which is generally associated with suncults, is here a particular emblem of de-structive and all-consuming time. It occurs in this sense in many representationsof Roman as well as mediaeval funerals.Crook The hooked staff is a pastoral attribute in the Church and a symbolof faith (4). By virtue of the sigmoid significance of the hook, it stands for divinepower, communication and connexion (50); because of its spiral form it is asymbol of creative power.Cross The complex symbolism of the cross neither denies nor supplants thehistorical meaning in Christianity. But in addition to the realities of ChristianitySimple, primordial figure denoting orientation on a planesurface.St. Andrew’s cross: union of the Upper and Lower Worlds.Arrow-headed cross denoting centrifugal forces.Gammadion (fylfot or cross cramponnee) denoting the pathof peripheral forces.Doubled cross, expressive of parallel forces.Maltese cross (or cross of eight points), expressive of cen-tripetal forces."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"CROSS69there are two other essential factors: that of the symbolism of the cross as suchand that of the crucifixion or of ‘suffering upon the cross’. In the first place, thecross is dramatic in derivation, an inversion, as it were, of the Tree of Paradise.Hence, the cross is often represented in mediaeval allegory as a Y-shaped tree,depicted with knots and even with branches, and sometimes with thorns. Like theTree of Life, the cross stands for the ‘world-axis’. Placed in the mystic Centre ofthe cosmos, it becomes the bridge or ladder by means of which the soul may reachGod. There are some versions which depict the cross with seven steps, compa-rable with the cosmic trees which symbolize the seven heavens (17). The cross,consequently, affirms the primary relationship between the two worlds of thecelestial and the earthly (14). But, in addition, because of the cross-piece whichcuts cleanly across the upright (in turn implying the symbols of level and of theaxis of the world), it stands for the conjunction of opposites, wedding the spiri-tual (or vertical) principle with the principle of the world of phenomena. HenceCross of the Templars: forces disposed around a circumfer-ence.Teutonic cross: four triangles denoting a centripetal ten-dency.Cross of ovals, composed of one continuous line represen-tative of the direction of movement of forces.Lunate cross, representing (according to Piobb) the fourtangential circumferences and the phases of the moon.Cross with knobbed extremities representing the four Car-dinal Points of space."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"CROSS70its significance as a symbol for agony, struggle and martyrdom (14). Sometimesthe cross is T-shaped, further emphasizing the near-equilibrium of the opposingprinciples. Jung comments that in some traditions the cross is a symbol of fireand of the sufferings of existence, and that this may be due to the fact that the twoarms were associated with the kindling sticks which primitive man rubbed to-gether to produce fire and which he thought of as masculine and feminine. But thepredominant meaning of the cross is that of ‘Conjunction’. Plato, in Timaeus,tells how the demiurge joins up the broken parts of the world-soul by means oftwo sutures shaped like St. Andrew’s cross (31). Bayley stresses the fire-sym-bolism of the cross, and explains that all the words for ‘cross’ (crux, cruz, crowz,croaz, krois, krouz) have a common etymological basis in -ak, -ur or -os, signify-ing ‘light of the Great Fire’ (4). The cross has been widely used as a graphicemblem, very largely as a result of Christian influence but equally on account ofthe basic significance of the sign; for it is clear that all basic notions, whether theyare ideas or signs, have come about without the prompting of any cultural influ-ence. Hundreds of different shapes of crosses have been summarized in workssuch as Lehner’s Symbols, Signs and Signets, and it has been found possible, bythe study of graphic symbolism, to elucidate the particular meaning of each one.Many of them take the form of insignias of military orders, medals, etc. Theswastika is a very common type of cross (q.v. Swastika). The Egyptian, anseratedcross is particularly interesting in view of its antiquity. In Egyptian hieroglyphicsit stands for life or living (Nem Ankh) and forms part of such words as ‘health’ and‘happiness’. Its upper arm is a curve, sometimes almost closed to form a circle.Enel analyses this hieroglyphic as follows: ‘The phonetic significance of this signis a combination of the signs for activity and passivity and of a mixture of thetwo, and conforms with the symbolism of the cross in general as the synthesis ofthe active and the passive principle.’ The very shape of the anserated crossexpresses a profound idea: that of the circle of life spreading outwards from theOrigin and falling upon the surface (that is, upon the passivity of existence whichit then animates) as well as soaring up towards the infinite. It may also be seen asa magic knot binding together some particular combination of elements to formone individual, a view which would confirm its characteristic life-symbolism. Itmay also signify destiny. Judged from the macrocosmic point of view, that is ofits analogy with the world, the Ankh-cross may represent the sun, the sky and theearth (by reference to the circle, the upright and the horizontal lines). As a micro-cosmic sign, that is by analogy with man, the circle would represent the humanhead or reason (or the ‘sun’ which gives him life), the horizontal arm his arms, andthe upright his body (19). In sum, the most general significance of the cross is that"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"CROW71of the conjunction of opposites: the positive (or the vertical) with the negative (orhorizontal), the superior with the inferior, life with death. The basic idea behindthe symbolism of crucifixion is that of experiencing the essence of antagonism, anidea which lies at the root of existence, expressing as it does life’s agonizing pain,its cross-roads of possibilities and impossibilities, of construction and destruc-tion. Evola suggests that the cross is a synthesis of the seven aspects of space andtime, because its form is such that it both maintains and destroys free movement;hence, the cross is the antithesis of the Ouroboros, the serpent or dragon denotingthe primeval, anarchic dynamism which preceded the creation of the cosmos andthe emergence of order. There is, thus, a close relationship between the cross andthe sword, since both of them are wielded against the primordial monster (PlateV).Cross-roads According to Jung, it is a mother-symbol. He comments: ‘Wherethe roads cross and enter into one another, thereby symbolizing the union ofopposites, there is the “mother”, the object and epitome of all union.’ Amongstthe Ancients, cross-roads were symbols of an ambivalent theophany, since thejoining up of three elements always presupposes the existence of the three prin-ciples of the active (or beneficent), the neutral (or resultant or instrumental) andthe passive (or hurtful). Hence, cross-roads were sacred to the ‘triform’ Hecate.It was at the crossways that dogs were sacrificed to her, and the bodies of hangedmen dumped (31).Crow Because of its black colour, the crow is associated with the idea ofbeginning (as expressed in such symbols as the maternal night, primigenial dark-ness, the fertilizing earth). Because it is also associated with the atmosphere, it isa symbol for creative, demiurgic power and for spiritual strength. Because of itsflight, it is considered a messenger. And, in sum, the crow has been invested bymany primitive peoples with far-reaching cosmic significance. Indeed, for theRed Indians of North America it is the great civilizer and the creator of the visibleworld. It has a similar meaning for the Celts and the Germanic tribes, as well as inSiberia (35). In the classical cultures it no longer possesses such wide implica-tions, but it does still retain certain mystic powers and in particular the ability toforesee the future; hence its caw played a special part in rites of divination (8). InChristian symbolism it is an allegory of solitude. Amongst the alchemists itrecovers some of the original characteristics ascribed to it by the primitives,standing in particular for nigredo, or the initial state which is both the inherentcharacteristic of prime matter and the condition produced by separating out theElements (putrefactio) (32). An interesting development of crow-symbolism isthe representation of it with three legs drawn within a solar disk. In this form it is"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"CROWD72the first of the Chinese imperial emblems, and represents Yang or the active life ofthe Emperor. The three legs correspond to the sun-symbolism of the tripod: firstlight or rising sun, zenith or midday sun, and sunset or setting sun. In Beaumont’sview, the crow in itself signifies the isolation of him who lives on a superior plane(5), this being the symbolism in general of all solitary birds.Crowd The idea of the ‘crowd’ is symbolically superior to that of ‘multiplic-ity’, since it implies a new concept of the numerous as a totality, or of Onenessas a fragmented whole. Thus, Jung’s interpretation of the multitude or crowd iswell judged; he asserts that, especially when moving or restless, it corresponds toan analogous movement in the unconscious (31). Homer has a well-known similein which he likens a crowd of warriors in the agora (or in battle) to the ocean swell(constituting another symbol of the unconscious).Crown The essential meaning of the crown is derived from that of the head,with which it is linked—unlike the hat—not in a utilitarian but in a strictlyemblematic manner. By reference to level-symbolism, we may conclude that thecrown does not merely surmount the top of the body (and of the human being asa whole), but rises above it and therefore symbolizes, in the broadest and deepestsense, the very idea of pre-eminence. That is why a superlatively successfulachievement is spoken of as a ‘crowning achievement’. Hence, the crown is thevisible sign of success, of ‘crowning’, whose significance reaches beyond the actto the person who performed it. At first, crowns were made out of the limbs ofvarious trees, hence they are still connected with the symbolism of trees ingeneral and of some trees in particular. They were the attributes of the gods; andthey also were once a funeral-symbol (8). The metal crown, the diadem and thecrown of rays of light, are symbols of light and of spiritual enlightenment (4). Insome books of alchemy there are illustrations showing the planetary spiritsreceiving their crown—that is, their light—from the hands of their king—that is,the sun (32). The light they received from him is not equal in intensity but graded,as it were, in hierarchies, corresponding to the grades of nobility ranging from theking down to the baron (32). Books on alchemy also stress the affirmative andsublimating sense of the crown. In Margarita pretiosa, the six base metals arefirst shown as slaves, with their uncovered heads bowed low towards the feet ofthe ‘king’ (that is, gold); but, after their transmutation, they are depicted wearingcrowns on their heads. This ‘transmutation’ is a symbol of spiritual evolutionwhose decisive characteristic is the victory of the higher principle over the baseprinciple of the instincts. That is why Jung concludes that the radiant crown isthe symbol par excellence of reaching the highest goal in evolution: for he whoconquers himself wins the crown of eternal life (31). Secondary or more particularmeanings sometimes arise from the shape or the material of the crown, on occa-"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"CRUTCH73sion differing considerably from the basic meaning outlined above. The ancientcrown of the Egyptian pharaohs is a typical example of unusually shaped crownswith exceptional meanings. Marqués-Rivière here points to the emblematic andnear-figurative source of its two basic components: a white and a red crown. Theformer is similar to the mitre-like bonnets worn in the East through the ages. Thelatter ‘according to de Rochemonteix, is probably a pattern evolved from adaptedhieroglyphs. The coif is probably a glass, the curved stem of which representsvegetation and the upright stem the ideogram of the earth. . . . M. E. Soldi sees thecurved stem as a “projection of the solar disk, a spiralling flame which fertilizesthe seeds” ‘ (39).Crucifixion The symbolic meaning of the crucifixion—which does notoppose nor alter the historic fact, but provides further explanations of it—seemsto be related to the suffering which is at the root of all contradiction and ambiva-lence, especially if one bears in mind the practice in mediaeval iconography ofshowing Jesus on the cross surrounded by symmetrical pairs of objects or beings.These paired items are sometimes, but not always, based upon the actual wit-nesses of the scene. Thus, the cross may be shown between the sun and themoon, between the Virgin and St. John, the good and the bad thief, the lance andthe cup or chalice (or sometimes a stick and the sponge soaked in vinegar), and, ofcourse, between heaven and earth. On occasion, there is the added symbol of theHoly Spirit balancing Adam’s skull. These pairs of opposites, then, only serve toemphasize the essential binary system underlying the cross itself. The horizontallimb corresponds to the passive principle, that is, to the world of phenomena.The vertical limb denotes the active principle, that is, the transcendent world orspiritual evolution. The sun and moon are the cosmic representatives of thisdualism, echoed also in the symmetrical placing of the Beloved Disciple and theHoly Mother (of opposite sexes) who stand also, respectively, for the outcomeand the antecedent of the life and work of Jesus, and hence for the future and thepast. The two thieves represent binary symmetry on the moral plane, that is, thetwo potential attitudes between which Man must choose: penitence leading tosalvation and prevarication leading to damnation.Crutch The symbolic meaning of the crutch derives directly from its literalsense: the invisible, moral or economic means of supporting any other form ofexistence that may ‘lean’ upon it. In this sense it has often appeared in SalvadorDali’s paintings. It forms one of the Chinese emblems, again with the samesignificance (5). Frequently the crutch stands for an immoral, hidden or shamefulsupport; this is because the foot is a symbol of the soul (15), and an infirmity ormutilation of the foot is the counterpart of an incurable defect of the spirit.Hence, in legends and adventure-stories, the common appearance of sinister char-"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"CRYSTAL74acters, pirates, thieves and immoral hypocrites with crutches that bespeak theirsymbolic lameness. For a man to seek to revenge himself upon the cause of hismutilation shows that in his spirit he still retains some of his moral strength andthat he will endure until he has been vindicated. This is the symbolic backgroundto the famous novel Moby Dick, in which the protagonist has his leg torn off bythe monster of the deeps, but pursues it dauntlessly to the end.Crystal Like precious stones, it is a symbol of the spirit and of the intellectassociated with the spirit (56). It is interesting to note that mystic and surrealistalike share the same veneration for crystal. The ‘state of transparency’ is definedas one of the most effective and beautiful conjunctions of opposites: matter‘exists’ but it is as if it did not exist, because one can see through it. As an objectof contemplation, it offers neither hardness nor resistance nor suffering.Cube Among solid forms, it is the equivalent of the square. Hence it standsfor earth, or the material world of the four Elements. Denis the Carthusian pointedout that cubic objects are not capable of rotation as are spheres, and that thereforethey represent stability (14). This explains why the cube frequently forms partof allegories illustrating the solidity and the persistence of the virtues (8). It alsoexplains why, in symbols and emblems, thrones or chariots are sometimes givencubical form.Curl (or Loop) In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, the loop is a determi-native sign defining the ideas of either binding or unbinding, depending upon theposition of the loose ends (19). It corresponds to the general symbolism of bondsand knots. The hair-curl takes its meaning from the symbolism of the hair.Curtain A symbol of separation, as in the ‘veil of the Temple’ in Jerusalem.According to Gershom Scholem, ‘curtains hanging before the celestial realms ofthe worlds of the aeons play an important rôle in the Gnostic Pistis Sophia,apparently as a result of Jewish influence’. The succession of curtains is relatedto that of cloaks or veils, or even elements of dress and adornment, as they appearin the Mesapotamic poem of Ishtar’s Descent into Hell. The action of partingcurtains, rending veils or clothing, stripping off diadems, cloaks or bracelets,signifies a move towards an arcanum or the penetration of a mystery. Scholem, inLes Origines de la Kabbale, says that, among the emanations, similar curtainsappear personified in the fountains of Isaac Cohen.Cybele This goddess, the wife of Saturn, is the personification of the energyanimating the earth. The lions drawing her chariot represent the controlled ener-gies necessary for evolution; the chariot in which she is riding is cubic in shape,the cube being a symbol of the earth. Her crown is shaped like a battlementedwall, and this, like the cube, also conveys a sense of building. Associated onoccasions with this allegory, is a seven-pointed star (a symbol of cyclic progres-"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"DACTYLS75sion) and a lunar crescent (a symbol of the world of phenomena, of the appear-ance and disappearance of earthly forms in the sublunary world).Cycle The cyclic character of phenomena—cyclic, that is, because of thetendency of the final stage to curve back towards the initial stage of the processin question—leads to its being symbolized by figures such as the circle, the spiraland the ellipse. All processes are cyclic in this way, embracing movement inspace, passage through time, and any change in form or condition, whether theyare cycles pertaining to the year, the month, the week, the day, or the span of lifeof a man, a culture or a race. The symbolism of the Zodiac and the division intotwelve (four times three and vice versa) are inextricably linked with the symbolicmeaning of the cycle (40, 51). Graphically, the completed cycle is represented bytwo signs or images facing in opposite directions, symbolic of the acts of goingand coming. This can be seen for example in Roman steles, having footprintspointing in opposite directions.Cyclops A mythological giant, commonly portrayed as having a single eye inthe middle of his forehead. This eye does not have the usual symbolism of the‘third’ eye, but in this case, appears to symbolize the primary forces of nature.Cydippe A man with one leg and one foot, found in Romanesque decoration.It is the antithesis of the figure of the two-tailed siren. If the latter is a symbol offemininity, arising out of the number two, the cydippe is symbolic of masculinityarising out of the uneven number one. It may also have some connexion with thefigures of Hermes, and perhaps has a phallic significance.Cypress A tree dedicated by the Greeks to their infernal deity. The Romansconfirmed this emblem in their cult of Pluto, adding the name ‘funeral’ to it, asignificance which still clings to it today (8).DDactyls Mythic dactyls or fingers are related to the Cabiri (q.v.), and corre-spond to chthonian cults, their function being to link the nether world with theterrestrial (31). Symbolically they may be seen as those forces of the psychewhich ordinarily go unheeded but which help as much as hinder the conscious"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"DAENA76projects of the reason. For Jung they figure among the symbols of ‘multiplicity’which form around the essential elements of the psychic structure.Daena In the ancient Iranian religion, the Daena symbolized the feminineprinciple (Anima) of the human spirit, while at the same time identifying it withthe sum of the actions—good and bad—that man performs during his life. On thethird day after his death, the just man is greeted on the bridge of Çinvat by awondrously beautiful young girl, the Daena, who becomes united with him foreternity, thus reconstituting the primordial Androgyne. On a higher plane, theCabbala needed to give reality to the principle of the eternal feminine and gave thename of Shekhinah to the ‘feminine aspect of God’. The Shekhinah is a complexentity—possibly one of Jehovah’s angels or Jehovah himself; in every case it isthe Loved One referred to in the Song of Solomon. A. E. Waite, in Secret Doctrinein Israel (1913), points out that this spiritual principle bears no relation to thatrepresented by the Virgin Mary of Christianity, but is related rather to the HolySpirit of the Trinity. He observes that the Shekhinah is the angel who comes tothe aid of those just men who are suffering, above all if they are suffering for love,and that her work in the soul is analogous to that of the soul in the body. TheDaena, as has been stated, does not attain such an elevated position in the hierar-chy and should rather be identified with the Jungian anima.Dance The corporeal image of a given process, or of becoming, or of thepassage of time. In Hindu doctrine, the dance of Shiva in his rôle as Natarâjâ (theKing of the Cosmic Dance, symbolizing the union of space and time withinevolution) clearly has this meaning (6). There is a universal belief that, in so far asit is a rhythmic art-form, it is a symbol of the act of creation (56). This is why thedance is one of the most ancient forms of magic. Every dance is a pantomime ofmetamorphosis (and so calls for a mask to facilitate and conceal the transforma-tion), which seeks to change the dancer into a god, a demon or some other chosenform of existence. Its function is, in consequence, cosmogonic. The dance is theincarnation of eternal energy: this is the meaning of the circle of flames surround-ing the ‘dancing Shiva’ (60). Dances performed by people with linked armssymbolize cosmic matrimony, or the union of heaven and earth—the chain-sym-bol—and in this way they facilitate the union of man and wife (51).Darkness Equated with matter, with the maternal and germinant, but it pre-exists the differentiation of matter (9). The dualism of light/darkness does notarise as a symbolic formula of morality until primordial darkness has been splitup into light and dark. Hence, the pure concept of darkness is not, in symbolictradition, identified with gloom—on the contrary, it corresponds to primigenialchaos. It is also related to mystic nothingness, and, in consequence, Hermetic"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"DEATH, THE77language is an obscurum per obscurius, a path leading back to the profoundmystery of the Origin. According to Guénon, light is the basic principle behinddifferentiation and hierarchical order. The gloom which preceded the Fiat Luxalways, in traditional symbolism, represents the state of undeveloped potentiali-ties which give rise to chaos (29). Hence, the darkness introduced into the world,after the advent of light, is regressive; hence, too, the fact that it is traditionallyassociated with the principle of evil and with the base, unsublimated forces.Day of Rest Like so many other aspects of existence—both in customs andin utilitarian activities—the concept of the Day of Rest does not arise frommaterial or empirical necessity (even leaving aside the religious implications).According to Erich Fromm, the observance of the Sabbath amongst the Hebrewsdoes not denote mere repose for reasons of health, but rather something muchmore profound. In effect, because work implies a state of change—of war—between man and the world around him, it follows that rest designates peacebetween him and Nature. One day a week—a day which, by virtue of the analogybetween time and cosmic space, corresponds to the idea of the centre implicit inthe position of the sun among the planets or the location of the earth according tothe geocentric system—must be set aside for experiencing the spontaneous, per-fect harmony of man in Nature. By not working, the human being can break awayfrom the order of change which gives rise to history, and thereby free himself fromtime and space to return to the state of paradise (23). This symbolism providesthe explanation, furthermore, of what Bell called ‘the fiery restlessness of therebel’: the instinctive hatred of all forms of rest characteristic of the man ofwarlike spirit who challenges all Nature and the world as it appears to the senses.Death Symbolically, death represents the end of an epoch, particularly whenit takes the form of sacrifice or the desire for self-destruction in the face ofunendurable tension (as with Romeo and Juliet, or Tristan and Isolde). The herodies young for this same reason: Siegfried, Achilles or Balder for example. Thepublic necessity for a sacrifice of this kind was what lay behind the ‘ritualassassination of the king’ in which the possibility of his survival was sometimesleft open, should he prove victor in combat. As an example of this rite, Frazercites a festival called ‘The Great Sacrifice’ in which the king of Calicut was madeto hazard his crown and his life. It took place every twelve years, at the time theplanet Jupiter turns back towards the constellation of Cancer, since there was asupposed relationship between the planet and the king’s destiny (21).Death, The The thirteenth enigma of the Tarot pack. This playing-cardshows the well-known allegory of the skeleton with the difference that here,contrary to custom, he wields his scythe towards the left. And the bones of the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"DECAPITATION78skeleton are not grey but pink. The ground is strewn with human remains, butthese remains, like those in legend and folklore, have the appearance of livingbeings—heads, for instance, keep their living expression; hands emerging fromthe ground seem ready for action. Everything in this enigmacard tends to ambiva-lence, underlining the fact that if life is, in itself, closely bound up with death (asHeraclitus pointed out and as mediaevalists and modern scientists have corrobo-rated), death is also the source of life—and not only of spiritual life but of theresurrection of matter as well. One must resign oneself to dying in a dark prisonin order to find rebirth in light and clarity. In the same manner as Saturn prunedthe tree in order to rejuvenate it, so Siva (or Shiva) transforms beings by destroy-ing their form without annihilating their essence. On the other hand, death is thesupreme liberation. In the positive sense, then, this enigma symbolizes the trans-formation of all things, the progress of evolution, dematerialization; in the nega-tive, melancholy decomposition, or the end of anything determinate and thereforecomprehended within a period of time (59). All allegories and images of deathhave the same significance. In Greek mythology, death was envisaged as thedaughter of the night and the sister of sleep. Horace depicts death with blackwings and a net for snaring his victims (8), a net which is identical with that of theUranian gods as well as that of the Roman gladiator. Death is related to theElement earth and to the range of colours from black, through the earth-colouredshades, to green. It is also associated with the symbolism of manure.Decapitation Ritual decapitation arose from the discovery in prehistorictimes that the head is the receptacle of the spirit. The preservation of heads, aspractised by certain primitive peoples, holds the same significance as the sepa-rate burial of that part of the body. The same symbolic meaning is attached to thedecorative use of sculpted heads, set at particular vantage points in many medi-aeval temples, such as Clonfert Cathedral, in Ireland.Decorations (or Medals) The inverse of wound-symbolism. They denotesublimation and glorification, and are related to the red/white principle of al-chemy.Defile (or Gorge) Within the symbolism of landscape as a whole, the gorgecorresponds to the lower regions and is therefore closely related to the maternal,the unconscious and, ultimately, to the forces of evil. If the cavern, or the hollowinterior of a mountain, are authentic illustrations of the unconscious, which re-mains unknown or enigmatic or is experienced indirectly, then the gorge—and thefissure—is a symbol of a crack in the conscious life through which the innerpattern of the individual psyche, or of the worldsoul, may be glimpsed (32).Because of its associations with strategy, or with other derived ideas, the gorge"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"DESERT79also incorporates the notion of danger. By its shape, it implies a sense of inferior-ity in the face of overwhelming odds (suggested by the mountains or masses ofearth and rock which in effect constitute the gorge). On the other hand, thesenegative considerations may themselves be negated by the symbolism implicit inthe fact that water often runs along the bed of the gorge—and water is alwaysrelated to birth, regeneration and purification; this is further proof that the gorgehas a maternal symbolism.Deluge The tradition of the deluge, or of several deluges, is to be found in allparts of the world, with the exception of Africa (35). Science appears to haveverified its historical reality. Within the symbolic relationship between the moonand water, the deluge, according to Eliade, corresponds to the three days of the‘death of the moon’. As a catastrophe, the deluge is never represented as final,because it takes place under the sign of the lunar cycle and of the regeneratingproperties of water. It destroys forms, in other words, but not forces, thusleaving the way open for the re-emergence of life (17). Consequently, apart fromits material connotation, the deluge always stands for the final stage of a cycle,coinciding with the zodiacal sign Pisces (9). Torrential rains always retain some ofthe great symbolic content of the deluge; every fall of rain is tantamount topurification and regeneration, which in turn imply the basic idea of punishmentand completion.Desert It has a profound and clear-cut symbolism. Berthelot observes thatthe Biblical prophets, in order to counter the agrarian religions based on fertilityrites (related, according to Eliade, to orgies), never ceased to describe theirs as thepurest religion of the Israelites ‘when they were in the wilderness’. This confirmsthe specific symbolism of the desert as the most propitious place for divinerevelation, for which reason it has been said that ‘monotheism is the religion ofthe desert’ (7). This is because the desert, in so far as it is in a way a negativelandscape, is the ‘realm of abstraction’ located outside the sphere of existence(37), susceptible only to things transcendent. Furthermore, the desert is thedomain of the sun, not as the creator of energy upon earth but as pure, celestialradiance, blinding in its manifestation. Again: if water is associated with the ideasof birth and physical fertility, it is also opposed to the concept of the everlastingspirit; and, indeed, moisture has always been regarded as a symbol of moralcorruption. On the other hand, burning drought is the climate par excellence ofpure, ascetic spirituality—of the consuming of the body for the salvation of thesoul. Tradition provides further corroboration of this symbolism: for the He-brews, captivity in Egypt was a life held in opprobium, and to go out into thedesert was ‘to go out from Egypt’ (48). Finally, let us point to the emblematic"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"DESTRUCTION80relationship of the desert with the lion, which is a sun-symbol, verifying what wehave said about the solar symbolism of the desert.Destruction The traditional symbols of destruction are always ambivalent,whether we take the thirteenth mystery of the Tarot, the twelfth sign of theZodiac (Pisces), the symbolism of water or fire, or of any form of sacrifice. Everyending is a beginning, just as every beginning contains an end; this is the essentialidea of the symbols of mystic ‘Inversion’ which Schneider has subjected to suchcareful study. All this, then, should be borne in mind when we read such observa-tions as the following by Rudolf Steiner (taken from La Philosophie de la Liberté):‘To transform being into an infinitely superior non-being, that is the aim of thecreation of the world. The process of the universe is a perpetual combat . . . whichwill end only with the annihilation of all existence. The moral life of man, then,consists in taking part in universal destruction.’ This ‘destruction’—like thealchemic process—concerns only phenomena, or what is separate in space (thedisjunct or the remote) and in time (the transitory). This is why Steiner entitleda collection of his poems Destruction or Love.Devil, The The fifteenth mystery of the Tarot pack. It takes the form ofBaphomet (of the Knights Templars) portrayed as having the head and feet of ahe-goat and the bosom and arms of a woman. Like the Greek sphinx, it incorpo-rates the four Elements: its black legs correspond to the earth and to the spirits ofthe nether world; the green scales on its flanks allude to water, the undines, anddissolution; its blue wings to sylphs and also to bats (because the wings aremembranous); and the red head is related to fire and salamanders. The aim of thedevil is regression or stagnation in what is fragmentary, inferior, diverse anddiscontinuous. Finally, this Tarot mystery-card is related to the instincts and todesire in all its passionate forms, the magic arts, disorder and perversion (59).Devouring This symbol, which finds its literal expression in the act, or thefear, of being devoured, is to be found in modified form in the notion of Entangle-ment, and also, according to Diel, in that of sinking into mud or a swamp. Jung, inconnexion with this, quotes the Biblical passage about Jonah and the whale, butJonah is really better associated with the ‘Night Sea-Crossing’. Jung also thinks(31) that fear of incest becomes fear of being devoured by the mother, and thatthis is then disguised by the imagination in such forms as the witch who swallowsup children, the wolf, the ogre, the dragon, etc. On the cosmic plane, the symboldoubtless relates to the final swallowing up by the earth of each human body afterdeath, that is, to the dissolution of the body, so that the symbol may well berelated to digestion. In consequence, all those stories which ‘have a happy end-ing’, in which children who have been swallowed whole still live inside the animal"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"DIGESTION81and eventually escape, refer no doubt to the Christian dogma of the hope ofresurrection in the flesh.Dew All that comes down from the heavens (the thunderbolt, the aerolite, themeteorite, rain or dew) has a sacred character. But dew has a double significance,alluding also to spiritual illumination, since it is the true forerunner of dawn andof the approaching day (33). The clear, pure water of dew is, according to sometraditions, closely connected with the idea of light. There are occasional refer-ences in the Far East to the ‘tree of sweet dew’ situated on mount Kuen-Lun, theequivalent of the Hindu Meru and other sacred mountains symbolizing the world-axis. Light spreads outwards from this tree (25), and, through the process ofsynaesthesia, it has come to be known as the ‘singing tree’ of legend and folklore.Diamond Etymologically, it comes from the Sanskrit dyu, meaning ‘lumi-nous being’. It is a symbol of light and of brilliance. The word ‘adamantine’ isconnected with the Greek adamas, meaning ‘unconquerable’ (4). In emblems, itoften indicates the irradiant, mystic ‘Centre’ (56). Like all precious stones, itpartakes of the general symbolism of treasures and riches, that is, moral andintellectual knowledge.Diana The goddess of woods, related, to nature in general and to fertility andwild animals (21). She bears the Greek name of Hecate, meaning ‘She who suc-ceeds from afar’, and she is therefore linked with the ‘Accursed Hunter’ (such asWotan). Accompanied by dogs, she becomes a night-huntress, in turn linked withthe demons of chthonian cults (31). It has been pointed out that her characteris-tics vary with the phases of the moon: Diana, Jana, Janus. This is why somemythological and emblematic designs show her as Hecate with three heads, afamous, triform symbol which—like the trident or the three heads of Cerberus—is the infernal inversion of the trinitarian form of the upper world. According toDiel, these threefold symbolic forms of the underworld allude also to the perver-sion of the three essential ‘urges’ of man: conservation, reproduction and spiritualevolution. If this is so, then Diana emphasizes the terrible aspect of Woman’snature. Nevertheless, because of her vows of virginity, she was endowed with amorally good character as opposed to that of Venus, as can be seen in the Hippolytusof Euripides.Digestion A symbol for swallowing, mastery, assimilation and dissolution.What is ‘undigested’ is what cannot be dissolved, that is, what cannot be con-quered or assimilated. The alchemists identified digestion with the dragon andwith the colour green (representing the irreducible element of nature, in contrastwith those substances which could be sublimated or transformed into spirit, or, inother words, ‘digested’). Romanesque iconography is characterized by an ex-"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"DIONYSOS82traordinary number of monsters swallowing or carrying in their belly or vomitingup animals, both real and fabulous, which they have devoured whole. The sym-bolism here must be that which we have just outlined, that is, parallel with yetcontrary to the belief of the cannibal that by devouring and digesting the vitalorgans of his enemy he finally vanquishes him, incorporating within himself thepotentialities of his victim.Dionysos An infernal deity, and a symbol of the uninhibited unleashing ofdesire, or of the lifting of any inhibition or repression (15). Nietzsche drewattention to the antithesis between Apollo and Dionysos as symbols of theextreme views of art and of life, drawing man, respectively, towards either orderor chaos; or, in other words—in accordance with the Freudian death-wish—towards either existence and eternal life, or self-annihilation. The insatiable char-acter of the Greek god—who is supposed to have come from Asia Minor or fromScythia—is apparent in the attributes commonly ascribed to him, such as thethyrsus surmounted by a phallic pine-cone, or the serpent, the horse, the bull, thepanther, the he-goat and the hog. According to Jung, the Dionysos-myth signifiesthe abyss of the ‘impassioned dissolution’ of each individual, as a result ofemotion carried to the extremes of paroxysm and in relation to the urge to escapefrom time into ‘pre-time’, characteristic of the orgy; the myth is therefore repre-sentative of an unconscious urge (32).Disappearance In many folktales, mediaeval legends and myths, sudden‘disappearances’ occur. Sometimes this is as a result of the translation of thevanished object to a distant place, and sometimes as a result of pure and simpleannihilation or destruction. Psychologically, this is a symbol of repression, par-ticularly if the vanished object is malign or dangerous. In reality, it is a form ofenchantment.Disk An emblem of the sun and also of the heavens. In China, the ‘sacreddisk’ is a symbol of celestial perfection (5), and the disk that actually representsthe sky (the jade disk called Pi) has a hole in the centre. The ‘winged disk’ is oneof the most widespread of ancient symbols, which is still in use today in signs andemblems; in the profoundest sense, it represents matter in a state of sublimationand transfiguration. The two small serpents which are often to be seen next to thedisk are those of the caduceus, alluding to the equipoise of opposing forces (59).But in a more esoteric sense, the winged disk signifies the disk in movement—inflight; it is therefore correctly used today in emblems created by an age which haslearnt how to dominate the air and space.Disguise Disguise—or rather, ‘transvestism’—finds its basis in the wearingof clothes belonging to the opposite sex. According to Eliade, this is a rite which"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"DISMEMBERMENT83is analogous to the symbolism of the orgy and frequently practised in it. Itspurport is to resuscitate the hypothetical, primordial, androgynous being re-ferred to by Plato in his Dialogues (17). Zimmer corroborates this symbolism,despite certain discrepancies, pointing out that in India there is a rite carried outevery year at the beginning of the rainy season, in which an elephant is escortedin procession by men dressed as women, who in this way pay homage to mater-nal nature (60).Disjunction Its simplest symbol is the letter Y, just as the letter X is thesimplest symbol of inversion. It corresponds to the idea of a cross-roads, of aduality or multiplicity of divergent paths. In ancient images (14th-18th centu-ries), the cross of certain crucifixes is sometimes represented in the form of a Y.Dismemberment An important symbol lies beneath the act of tearing topieces, or tearing limb from limb. Let us begin with some examples of the way thesymbol is used. The best known is the myth of Osiris torn to pieces by Set, whoscattered the fragments which Isis then diligently sought out and pieced togetheragain, one piece excepted. There are a great many legends and folktales which tellmuch the same story: giants’ bodies are cut to pieces and then magically puttogether again. Siegmund’s sword, in the Niebelungen saga, is broken in variousplaces beyond repair; only Siegfried, his son, is capable of reforging it. Accordingto Heinrich Zimmer, the dismemberment of the formless dragon Vritra, in Indianmythology, reveals the process whereby multiplicity sprang out of primigenialunity. Indian mythology also maintains that the creation of multiplicity was theoutcome of the sin of Indra, whose expiation implies the reintegration of allexistence into unity. Coomaraswamy maintains that the meaning of sacrifice isactually this creative and destructive movement—the systole and diastole ofreality; presentday theories of cosmogony support this view (60). From theviewpoint of the individual and his spiritual life, it is interesting to note that theGraeco-Russian philosopher Gurdjieff (according to Ouspensky in his In Searchof the Miraculous) founded his ‘Institute for the Harmonic Education of Man’upon the basis of the need to end all dispersal (or ‘dismemberment’) of theattention and of spiritual Oneness. In their time, the alchemists had already founda way of symbolizing the state of inner separation of the spiritual components bymeans of the stages of the opus, which they called solutio, calcinatio, incineratio,portraying them sometimes in such emblems as personal sacrifices or mutilationsof the body, such as cutting off the hands of the mother, or the claws of the lion,etc. (33). For Origen, the goal of Christianity was nothing less than the transfor-mation of man into a being of inner Oneness. Conversely, for Jung, to be pos-sessed by the unconscious (that is, by whims, manias and obsessions) is nothing"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"DISTAFF84short of being torn up into chaotic multiplicity. He also points out that the idea ofdisplacement or disiunctio is the counterfoil to the growth of the child in thematernal womb (as well as to mystic coniunctio). In this way, then, every symbolwhich stands for an involutive, degenerating or destructive process is based uponthe changing of unity into multiplicity, as, for example, the breaking of a rock intomany fragments. Mutilations of the body, the prising apart of what is united, areso many symbols of analogous situations in the spirit.Distaff Like the spindle and the shuttle, the distaff symbolizes time, thebeginning and the continuance of creation. Distaffs also have a sexual significance.They are the attributes of the Parcae, who spin the thread of life, and cut it short(56, 38).Dog An emblem of faithfulness, and it is in this sense that it appears so oftenat the feet of women in the engravings on mediaeval tombs; in the same way thelion, an attribute of the male, symbolizes valour (20). In Christian symbolism, thedog has another sense, deriving from the function of the sheep-dog: that of guard-ing and guiding the flocks, which at times becomes an allegory of the priest (46).In a more profound sense, though still related to the foregoing, the dog is—like thevulture—the companion of the dead on their ‘Night Sea-Crossing’, which isassociated with the symbolisms of the mother and of resurrection. It has a similarsignificance when it appears in scenes depicting the Mithraic sacrifice of the bull(31). In alchemy, it was used as a sign rather than as a symbol. A dog devoured bya wolf represents the purification of gold by means of antimony.Doll or Puppet The doll, as a symbol, appears more often in psychopathol-ogy than in the main stream of traditional symbolism. It is well known that in anumber of mental diseases the patient makes a doll which he keeps carefullyhidden. According to J.-J. Rousseau the personality of the sick person is pro-jected into the toy. In other cases it has been interpreted as a form of erotomaniaor deviation of the maternal instinct: in short, a hangover from, or regression to aninfantile state. Recently, in so-called ‘Pop-art’, dolls have been included in ‘infor-mal’ pictorial images. In Spain Modesto Cuixart has produced the most dramaticand profound work of this kind, the obvious symbolism of which is related to the‘putti’ of Renaissance art, but, by a reversal of meaning, these dolls are made toappear maimed and soiled as if they were the corpses of children annihilated bybombs and other forces of destruction.Dolphin The figure of the dolphin can be seen in many allegories andemblems, sometimes duplicated. When the two dolphins—or even figures repre-senting an indeterminate fish—are pointing in the same direction, the duplicationmay be obeying the dictates of the law of bilateral symmetry for merely ornamen-"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"DRAGON85tal reasons, or it may be a simple symbol of equipoise. But the inverted arrange-ment, that is, with one dolphin pointing upwards and the other downwards,always symbolizes the dual cosmic streams of involution and evolution; this iswhat the 17th-century Spanish writer Saavedra Fajardo meant by ‘Either up ordown’. The dolphin by itself is an allegory of salvation, inspired in the ancientlegends which show it as the friend of man. Its figure is associated with that of theanchor (another symbol of salvation), with pagan, erotic deities and with othersymbols (20). The ancients also held that the dolphin was the swiftest of marineanimals, and hence, when, among the emblems of Francesco Colonna, it is showntwined round an anchor, it comes to signify arrested speed, that is, prudence.Door A feminine symbol (32) which, notwithstanding, contains all the impli-cations of the symbolic hole, since it is the door which gives access to the hole; itssignificance is therefore the antithesis of the wall. There is the same relationshipbetween the temple-door and the altar as between the circumference and thecentre: even though in each case the two component elements are the farthestapart, they are nonetheless, in a way, the closest since the one determines andreflects the other. This is well illustrated in the architectural ornamentation ofcathedrals, where the façade is nearly always treated as if it were an altar-piece.Double Every case of duplication concerns duality, balanced symmetry andthe active equipoise of opposite forces. Double images, the symmetrical duplica-tion of forms or figures—such as the supporters in heraldry—symbolize pre-cisely that. But any case of duplication based upon a horizontal axis, in which theupper figure is the inverse of the lower, has a deeper meaning arising from thesymbolism of level. A dual being is often found in cabbalistic emblems, the upperfigure being known as Metatron and the lower Samael; it is said of them that theyare inseparable companions for life (57). It may well be that beneath this imagethere lies a symbol of the essential ambivalence of all phenomena, or, rather, thatit refers to the great myth of the Gemini.Dove The Slavs believe that, at death, the soul turns into a dove (4). This birdpartakes of the general symbolism of all winged animals, that is, of spiritualityand the power of sublimation. It is also symbolic of souls, a motif which iscommon in Visigothic and Romanesque art (46). Christianity, inspired in theScriptures, depicts the third person of the Trinity—the Holy Ghost—in theshape of a dove, although he is also represented by the image of a tongue ofPentecostal fire (4).Dragon A fabulous animal and a universal, symbolic figure found in themajority of the cultures of the world—primitive and oriental as well as classical.A morphological study of the legendary dragon would lead to the conclusion that"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"DRAGON86it is a kind of amalgam of elements taken from various animals that are particu-larly aggressive and dangerous, such as serpents, crocodiles, lions as well asprehistoric animals (38). Krappe believes that the amazement occasioned by thediscovery of the remains of antediluvian monsters may have been a contributoryfactor in the genesis of the mythic dragon. The dragon, in consequence, stands for‘things animal’ par excellence, and here we have a first glimpse of its symbolicmeaning, related to the Sumerian concept of the animal as the ‘adversary’, aconcept which later came to be attached to the devil. Nevertheless, the dragon—like all other symbols of the instincts in the non-moral religions of antiquity—sometimes appears enthroned and all but deified, as, for example, in the standardsand pennons pertaining to the Chinese Manchu dynasty and to the Phoeniciansand Saxons (4). In a great many legends, overlaying its deepest symbolic sense,the dragon appears with this very meaning of the primordial enemy with whomcombat is the supreme test. Apollo, Cadmus, Perseus and Siegfried all conquerthe dragon. In numerous masterpieces of hagiography, the patron saints of knight-hood—St. George and St. Michael the Archangel—are depicted in the very act ofslaying the monster; there is no need to recall others than the St. George ofCarpaccio, or of Raphael, or the St. Michael of Tous by Bermejo. For Dontenville(16), who tends to favour an historicist and sociological approach to the symbol-ism of legends, dragons signify plagues which beset the country (or the individualif the symbol takes on a psychological implication). The worm, the snake and thecrocodile are all closely linked with the concept of the dragon in their own par-ticular way. In France, the dragon is also related to the ogre as well as to Gargantuaand giants in general. In Schneider’s view, the dragon is a symbol of sickness (51).But before going further into its meaning, let us quote some examples to showhow widespread are the references to this monster. The classics and the Biblevery frequently allude to it, providing us with detailed information about itsappearance, its nature and habits. But their descriptions point to not one butseveral kinds of dragon, as Pinedo has noted: ‘Some give it the form of a wingedserpent; it lives in the air and the water, its jaws are immense, it swallows men andanimals having first killed them with its enormous tail. Conversely, others makeit a terrestrial animal, its jaws are quite small, its huge and powerful tail is aninstrument of destruction, and it also flies and feeds upon the blood of the animalsit kills; there are writers who consider it to be amphibious, in which case its headbecomes that of a beautiful woman with long flowing hair and it is even moreterrible than the previous versions.’ In the Bible, there are the following refer-ences to the dragon: Daniel xiv, 22, 27; Micah i, 8; Jeremiah xiv, 6; Revelation xii,3, 7; Isaiah xxxiv, 13, and xliii, 20. There are further mentions by Rabanus Maurus"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"DRAGON87(Opera, III), Pliny (VIII, 12), Galen, Pascal (De Coronis, IX), and among othercharacteristics which these writers ascribe to the dragon are the following particu-larly interesting points: that it is strong and vigilant, it has exceptionally keeneyesight, and it seems that its name comes from the Greek word derkein (‘see-ing’). Hence it was given the function, in clear opposition to its terrible implica-tions, of guarding temples and treasures (like the griffin), as well as being turnedinto an allegory of prophecy and wisdom. In the Bible, it is the negative side ofthe symbol which receives emphasis; it is interesting to note that the anagram ofHerod in Syrian—ierud and es—means ‘flaming dragon’ (46). Sometimes thedragon is depicted with a number of heads and its symbolism then becomescorrespondingly unfavourable, given the regressive and involutive sense of allnumerical increase. ‘And behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and tenhorns, and seven crowns upon his heads(‘), in the words of Revelation (xii, 3). Onother occasions, the dragon is used in emblems, in which case it is the symbolismof the form or shape which takes precedence over that of the animal, as forexample, the dragon biting its tail—the Gnostic Ouroboros, a symbol of all cyclicprocesses and of time in particular. The dragon figured quite frequently in al-chemy; for the alchemists, a number of dragons fighting with each other illus-trated the state of putrefactio (separating out the Elements, or psychic disintegra-tion). And the winged dragon represented the volatile element, while the winglesscreature stood for the fixed element (according to Albert Poison). It is perhaps inChina that this monster has been most utilized and has achieved its greatestdegree of transfiguration. Here it becomes an emblem of imperial power. Whereasthe Emperor numbered the five-clawed dragon among his ornaments, the officialsof his court had the right to keep only the four-clawed (5). According to Diel, thegeneric dragon of China symbolizes the mastering and sublimation of wickedness(15), because the implication is that of a ‘dragon conquered’, like that whichobeys St. George once he has overcome it. Frazer tells how the Chinese, whenthey wish for rain, make a huge dragon out of wood and paper and carry it inprocession; but if it does not rain, then they destroy the dragon (21). Chuang-tzumaintains that this arises from the fact that the dragon and the serpent, investedwith the most profound and all-embracing cosmic significance, are symbols for‘rhythmic life’. The association of dragon/lightning/rain/fecundity is very com-mon in archaic Chinese texts (17), for which reason the fabulous animal becomesthe connecting-link between the Upper Waters and earth. However, it is impos-sible to generalize about the dragon of Chinese mythology, for there are subterra-nean, aerial and aquatic dragons. ‘The earth joins up with the dragon’ means thatit is raining.

Arelated and powerful part of its meaning is that of strength and speed. The oldestChinese images of the dragon are very similar to those of the horse (13). Inesoteric Chinese thought, there are dragons which are linked with colour-symbol-ism: the red dragon is the guardian of higher science, the white dragon is a lunardragon. These colours derive from the planets and the signs of the Zodiac. In theMiddle Ages in the Western world, dragons make their appearance with the throatand legs of an eagle, the body of a huge serpent, the wings of a bat and with a tailculminating in an arrow twisted back upon itself. This, according to Count PierreVincenti Piobb, signifies the fusion and confusion of the respective potentialitiesof the component parts: the eagle standing for its celestial potential, the serpentfor its secret and subterranean characteristic, the wings for intellectual elevation,and the tail (because the form is that of the zodiacal sign for Leo) for submissionto reason (48). But, broadly speaking, present-day psychology defines the dragon-symbol as ‘something terrible to overcome’, for only he who conquers the dragonbecomes a hero (56). Jung goes as far as to say that the dragon is a mother-image(that is, a mirror of the maternal principle or of the unconscious) and that itexpresses the individual’s repugnance towards incest and the fear of committingit (31), although he also suggests that it quite simply represents evil (32). EsotericHebrew tradition insists that the deepest meaning of the mystery of the dragonmust remain inviolate (according to the rabbi Simeon ben Yochai, quoted byBlavatsky) (9). The universal dragon (Katholikos ophis) of the Gnostics is the‘way through all things’. It is related to the concept of chaos (‘our Chaos or Spiritis a fiery dragon which conquers all things’—Philaletha, Introitus) and of dissolu-tion (The dragon is the dissolution of bodies’). (The quotations are taken from thePseudo-Democritus.) Regarding symbols of dissolution, Hermetic doctrine usesthe following terms: Poison, viper, universal solvent, philosophical vinegar=thepotential of the undifferentiated (or the Solve), according to Evola. He adds thatdragons and bulls are the animals fought by sun-heroes (such as Mithras, Siegfried,Hercules, Jason, Horus, or Apollo) and—bearing in mind the equationswoman=dragon, mercury and water; and green=’what is undigested’—that ‘if thedragon reappears in the centre of the “Citadel of Philosophers” of Khunrath, it isstill a dragon which has to be conquered and slain: it is that which everlastinglydevours its own self, it is Mercury as an image of burning thirst or hunger or theblind impulse towards gratification’, or, in other words, Nature enthralled andconquered by Nature, or the mystery of the lunar world of change and becoming"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"DRYNESS89as opposed to the world of immutable being governed by Uranus. Böhme, in DeSignatura rerum, defines a will which desires and yet has nothing capable ofsatisfying it except its own self, as ‘the ability of hunger to feed itself’ (Plate VI).Drum A symbol of primordial sound, and a vehicle for the word, for traditionand for magic (60). With the aid of drums, shamans can induce a state of ecstasy.It is not only the rhythm and the timbre which are important in the symbolism ofthe primitive drum, but, since it is made of the wood of ‘the Tree of the World’,the mystic sense of the latter also adheres to it (18). According to Schneider, thedrum is, of all musical instruments, the most pregnant with mystic ideas; InAfrica, it is associated with the heart. In the most primitive cultures, as in themost advanced, it is equated with the sacrificial altar and hence it acts as amediator between heaven and earth. However, given its bowl-shape and its skin,it corresponds more properly to the symbolism of the Element of earth. A sec-ondary meaning turns upon the shape of the instrument, and it should be notedthat it is in this respect that there is most variation in significance. The threeessential shapes are: the drum in the form of an hour-glass, symbolizing Inversionand the ‘relationship between the two worlds’ (the Upper and the Lower); theround drum, as an image of the world; and the barrel-shaped, associated withthunder and lightning (50).Dryness Dryness is the principle directly opposed to that of organic life.The latter is associated with the fertility of the soil—plants and animal life.Dryness, on the other hand, is an expression of the psychic ‘climate’. It is a signof virility, of passion, of the predominance of the Element of fire (2). The symbolof the ‘sea king’ as a spirit immersed in the deeps of the unconscious is a clearexample, with his cry: ‘The man who rescues me from the waters of the ocean andleads me to dry land will be rewarded with everlasting riches.’ The waters heresymbolize debased existence, subject to time and to things transitory, behaving inaccordance with the feminine principle of ‘wetness’. Dryness is an image ofimmortality (32); hence the tendency of individuals anxious to recover theirstrength of spirit—or to acquire it—to make for the desert, the ‘dry landscape’par excellence; and hence the fact that a man with a ‘dry’ personality is, contraryto appearances and common belief, really intensely passionate. Eliade observesthat to aspire to be dry is to express the longing for the fleshless, spiritual life, andhe quotes Heraclitus’ maxim that ‘Death, for the soul, is to become as water’. Andto quote a fragment of Orphic teaching: ‘Water is the death of the soul’ (Clement,Strom. VI, 2, 17, 1—Kern 226); and Porphyry (De antro nymph., 10-11) explainsthat the souls of the dead tend towards water because of the desire for reincarna-tion (17)."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"DUALISM90Dualism Dualism is defined as any system which implies a binary pattern,but which is characterized less by a complementary thesis and antithesis tendingto resolve into a synthesis than by two opposed principles. The Manichean andGnostic religions were moral dualisms. Some cosmic forms of division into twoparts—such as the Chinese year split into two halves, one (Yang) in which theactive and benign forces predominate, and the other (Yi n) in which the passive andmalign forces prevail—are binary systems rather than dualisms, because thedouble, contradictory aspects are synthesized within a system of wider scope. R.Bertrand, in La Tradition secrète (Paris 1943), speaking about this Yang-Yinsymbol, observes: ‘The dualism of religion (or of mystic or cosmic philosophy)is theoretical or superficial; in actual fact, there is always something extra—athird term which prevents the two opposing terms from cancelling each other out,forcing both these force-principles to yield, that is, to function alternately andnot simultaneously. Thus, the black and white of the Yin-Yang bounded by thecircle of stability, t’ai-chi, combine to form in effect a ternary system, the Ta o.’However, this solution by means of the ‘third term’ serves less to ‘resolve’ theproblem than to prolong it indefinitely, since it encourages the persistence of thedualist state by virtue of the inner equilibrium which it implies. It is as if, in thesymbolism of alchemy, the twin currents—ascending and descending—of solu-tion and coagulation were kept in perpetual rotation. But this is in fact not thecase: the positive forces triumph in the end—they transmute matter (that is, thepassive, negative or inferior principle), redeem it and bear it upwards. Dualsymbols are extremely common. To mention a few: the lash and the crook ofEgyptian pharaohs; emblems featuring cattle and agriculture, in which a straightand a curved sword symbolize the ‘straight’ and the ‘oblique’ path; the cabbalisticcolumns Jachin and Boaz; Mercy and Severity.Duck See Goose.Dumbness A symbol of the early stages of creation, and of the return to thispristine state. Hence legends often allude to someone struck dumb as a punish-ment for grave sins (which themselves imply just such a regression) (9).Dummy Like the homuncule and the mandragora, the dummy is an image ofthe soul, in primitive belief. The same applies to the scarecrow, the doll and anyfigure that bears a human likeness. Hence the belief in its magic properties.Duplication In symbolism, this is as common as Inversion. It may appear inthe form of a double colour-image (standing for the positive/negative principles),or as a symmetrical pattern of dualism, or as a binary system based upon acommon horizontal axis, in which case the symbolic meaning reflects the ambiva-lence of the form or being in question, since the symbol is able to indicate whetherthis form or being is located above or below the median level. Duplication is,"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"EAGLE91furthermore, like the reflection in the mirror, a symbol of consciousness—an echoof reality. It corresponds to the symbolism of the number two (31).Dwarf A symbol of ambivalent meaning. Like dactyls, elves and gnomes, thedwarf is the personification of those forces which remain virtually outside theorbit of consciousness. In folklore and mythology, the dwarf appears as a mis-chievous being, with certain childish characteristics befitting its small size, butalso as a protector like the Cabiri—this being the case with the ‘woodland dwarfs’inthe tale of Sleeping Beauty. For Jung, they may be regarded as the guardians of thethreshold of the unconscious (32). Now, smallness may be taken also as a sign ofdeformity, of the abnormal and inferior; this is the explanation, then, of the‘dancing Shiva’ appearing as an image of a deity dancing upon the prostrate bodyof a demon-dwarf who symbolizes the ‘blindness of life’, or the ignorance of man(his ‘pettiness’). Victory over this demon signifies true wisdom (60). It is prob-able that some such idea as this was in the mind of the Renaissance sculptor LeonLeoni when he fashioned the effigy of Charles I subduing Fury.EEagle A symbol of height, of the spirit as the sun, and of the spiritualprinciple in general. In the Egyptian hieroglyphic system, the letter A is repre-sented by the figure of an eagle, standing for the warmth of life, the Origin, theday. The eagle is a bird living in the full light of the sun and it is thereforeconsidered to be luminous in its essence, and to share in the Elements of air andfire. Its opposite is the owl, the bird of darkness and death. Since it is identifiedwith the sun and with the idea of male activity which fertilizes female nature, theeagle also symbolizes the father (19). It is further characterized by its daringflight, its speed, its close association with thunder and fire. It signifies, therefore,the ‘rhythm’ of heroic nobility. From the Far East to Northern Europe, the eagleis the bird associated with the gods of power and war. It is the equivalent in the airof the lion on earth; hence it is sometimes depicted with a lion’s head (cf. theexcavations at Tello). According to Vedic tradition, it is also important as a mes-senger, being the bearer of the soma from Indra. In Sarmatian art, the eagle is theemblem of the thunderbolt and of warlike endeavour. In all Oriental art it is often"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"EAGLE92shown fighting; either as the bird Imdugud, who ties the terrestrial and the celes-tial deer together by their tails, or as Garuda attacking the serpent. In pre-ColumbianAmerica, the eagle had a similar symbolism, signifying the struggle between thespiritual and celestial principle and the lower world. This symbolism occurs alsoin Romanesque art. In ancient Syria, in an identification rite, the eagle with humanarms symbolized sun-worship. It also conducted souls to immortality. Similarly,in Christianity, the eagle plays the rôle of a messenger from heaven. Theodoretcompared the eagle to the spirit of prophecy; in general, it has also been identified(or, more exactly, the eagle’s flight, because of its swiftness, rather than the birditself) with prayer rising to the Lord, and grace descending upon mortal man.According to St. Jerome, the eagle is the emblem of the Ascension and of prayer(50). Among the Greeks it acquired a particular meaning, more allegorical thanproperly symbolic in nature, in connexion with the rape of Ganymede. Moregenerally speaking, it was believed to fly higher than any other bird, and hencewas regarded as the most apt expression of divine majesty. The connexion be-tween the eagle and the thunderbolt, already mentioned above, is confirmed inMacedonian coinage and in the Roman signum. The ability to fly and fulminate,to rise so as to dominate and destroy baser forces, is doubtless the essentialcharacteristic of all eagle-symbolism. As Jupiter’s bird it is the theriomorphicstorm, the ‘storm bird’ of remotest antiquity, deriving from Mesopotamia andthence spreading throughout Asia Minor (35). On Roman coins it occurs as theemblem of imperial power and of the legions. Its fundamental significance doesnot vary in alchemy, it merely acquires a new set of terms applicable to thealchemic mystique: it becomes the symbol of volatilization. An eagle devouring alion is the symbol of the volatilization of the fixed by the volatile (i.e. accordingto alchemical equations: wings=spirit; flight=Imagination, or the victory of spiri-Heraldic eagle."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"EFFIGY93tualizing and sublimating activity over involutive, materializing tendencies). Likeother animals, when in the sign of the Gemini, the eagle undergoes total or partialduplication. Thus arises the two-headed eagle (related to the Janus symbol)which is usually depicted in two colours of great mystical significance: red andwhite. In many emblems, symbols and allegories, the eagle is depicted carrying avictim. This is always an allusion to the sacrifice of lower beings, forces, instinctsand to the victory of the higher powers (i.e. father principle, logos) (50). Danteeven calls the eagle the bird of God (4). Jung, ignoring the multiple significance ofits symbolism, defines it simply as ‘height’, with all the consequences that flowfrom a specific location in space. On the other hand the constellation of the Eagleis placed just above the man carrying the pitcher of Aquarius, who follows thebird’s movement so closely that he seems to be drawn after it by unseen bonds.From this it has been inferred that Aquarius is to be identified with Ganymede,and also with ‘the fact that even the gods themselves need the water of theUranian forces of life’ (40).Ear of Corn An emblem of fertility and an attribute of the sun (8). It alsosymbolizes the idea of germination and growth—of the development of anyfeasible potentiality. The sheaf has a symbolic significance which confirms thatof the individual ear: it adds the ideas of integration and control inherent in thesymbolism of a ‘bunch’ to that of fertility or increase implicit in the single ear.Generally speaking, all sheafs, bunches and sprays stand for psychic forceswhich are integrated and directed to a proper purpose (Plate VII).Earth, The The Northern hemisphere is regarded as that which representslight, corresponding to the positive principle Yang; the Southern is linked withthat of darkness and corresponds to Yin. Hence, cultural movements pass fromthe Northern to the Southern hemispheres (40).Earthquake Most primitive and astrobiological cultures attribute the causeof the earthquake to a theriomorphic demon. In Japan, the earth is supposed to besupported by a huge fish; in Sanskrit literature by a turtle; in North America bya serpent. The earthquake partakes of the general significance of all catastro-phes—the sudden change in a given process, which may be either for the better orfor the worse. On occasion the earthquake is thought to promote fertility. Basi-cally it is an application of the universal symbolism of sacrifice and of cosmicInversion (35).Effigy Every effigy, as an image of a being, expresses the psychic aspect ofthat being. Hence, given Jung’s contention that the magic and the psychic arepractically the same thing, it becomes easy to understand the importance ofeffigies in magic. The burning of a person in effigy—an ancient practice that hasstill not been totally banished—does not, then, betoken merely the impotent"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"EFFULGENCE94spite of one who is unable to attack the real person—although this may well be asecondary consideration—but is an act against the image of that person, that is,against the impression that he has made in the minds of others—against hismemory and his spiritual presence. One can explain keepsakes and portraits on asimilar basis, for they are linked in the mind not so much with the real person theypertain to, as with the imago or projection of that person within us. The effigy,consequently, is a symbol of an image rather than of a being.Effulgence According to Evola, is a symbol of the force of the undifferenti-ated, or of dissolution.Egg A great many prehistoric tombs in Russia and Sweden have revealed clayeggs which had been left there as emblems of immortality (17). In the language ofEgyptian hieroglyphs, the determinative sign of the egg represents potentiality,the seed of generation, the mystery of life (19). This meaning persisted among thealchemists, who added explicitly the idea that it was the container for matter andfor thought (57). In this way was the transition effected from the concept of theegg to the Egg of the World, a cosmic symbol which can be found in most sym-bolic traditions—Indian, Druidic, etc. (26). The vault of space came to be knownas an Egg, and this Egg consisted of seven enfolding layers—betokening the sevenheavens or spheres of the Greeks (40). The Chinese believe that the first man hadsprung from an egg dropped by Tien from heaven to float upon the primordialwaters. The Easter egg is an emblem of immortality which conveys the essence ofthese beliefs. The golden egg from which Brahma burst forth is equivalent to thePythagorean circle with a central point (or hole). But it was in Egypt that thissymbol most frequently appeared. Egyptian naturalism—the natural curiosity ofthe Egyptians about the phenomena of life—must have been stimulated by therealization that a secret animal-growth comes about inside the closed shell, whencethey derived the idea, by analogy, that hidden things (the occult, or what appearsto be non-existent) may actively exist. In the Egyptian Ritual, the universe istermed the ‘egg conceived in the hour of the Great One of the dual force’. The godRa is displayed resplendent in his egg. An illustration on a papyrus, in the œdipusÆgyptiacus of Kircher (III, 124), shows the image of an egg floating above amummy, signifying hope of life hereafter. The winged globe and the beetle push-ing its ball along have similar implications (9). The Easter-time custom of the‘dancing egg’, which is placed in the jet of a fountain, owes its origin, according toKrappe (who refers only to the Slavs), to the belief that at that time of the yearthe sun is dancing in the heavens. The Lithuanians have a song which runs asfollows: ‘The sun dances over a mountain of silver; he is wearing silver boots onhis feet’(35)."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"ELEMENTS, THE95Egypt A traditional symbol of the animal in man (57). Hence, ‘to go out ofEgypt’ is to abandon the sensual and the material and to progress towards thePromised Land across the Red Sea and the desert: to progress towards a superior,transcendent state (46). The symbol is a Gnostic one.Elements, The The four-part distribution of the Elements, which, strictlyspeaking, corresponds to the three states of matter plus the agent which, throughthem, brings about the transformation of matter, corresponds to the concept, sooften illustrated in symbolism, of the stability of the number four and its derivedlaws. Earth (or solids), water (or liquids), air (or gas) and fire (the temperaturewhich brings about the transformations of matter) have been conceived in theWest from pre-Socratic days onwards as the ‘Cardinal Points’ of material exist-ence, and, by a close parallel, also of spiritual life. It is for this reason that GastonBachelard observes (3): ‘Earthly joy is riches and impediment; aquatic joy issoftness and repose; fiery pleasure is desire and love; airy delight is liberty andmovement.’ Jung stresses the traditional aspects: ‘Of the elements, two are ac-tive—fire and air, and two are passive—earth and water.’ Hence the masculine,creative character of the first two, and the feminine, receptive and submissivenature of the second pair (33). The arrangement of the Elements in hierarchalorder of importance or priority has varied from age to age and writer to writer; oneof the factors influencing this has been the question of whether or not to admit a‘fifth Element’, sometimes called ‘ether’, sometimes freely designated ‘spirit’ or‘quintessence’ in the sense of ‘the soul of things’. It will readily be understoodthat the hierarchical progression must proceed from the most spiritual down tothe most material, since creation is involution or materialization. Beginning, then,with the fifth Element at the Origin, identifying it with the power of the demiurge,next comes air (or wind) and fire, next water and lastly earth; or, in other words,deriving from the igniferous or aerial state comes the liquid and finally the solid.The connexion of the fifth Element (considered simply as the beginning of life)with air and fire is self-evident. Schneider, commenting upon Hindu tradition,observes that: ‘We can establish the equation: sound equals breath, wind, theprinciple of life, language and heat (or fire)’ (50). Now, Schneider goes on to say—and his criterion is here mainly psychological—that the orientation of the Ele-ments is an important factor always to be held in mind; for example, fire orientedtowards earth (or towards water) is an erotic Element, yet pointed towards air itstands for purification. He mentions the four mystic beings of Chinese mythol-ogy who express the fusion of two Elements: the phoenix combining fire and air,the green dragon air and earth, the tortoise earth and water, and the white tigerwater and fire (50). Bachelard suggests that, within the psychic life (or artistic"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"ELEPHANT96inspiration), no image is capable of accommodating the four Elements, since suchan amalgamation would be tantamount to neutralization or insufferable contradic-tion. True images, in his view, are unitary or binary; they can mirror monotonesof one substance or the conjunction of two (2). By virtue of the theory ofcorrespondences, the Elements may be associated, up to a certain point, with thefour ages and the points of the compass.Elephant Elephant-symbolism is somewhat complex for it embraces certainsecondary implications of a mythic character. In the broadest and universal sense,it is a symbol of strength and of the power of the libido (42). Indian tradition hasit that elephants are the caryatids of the universe. In processions, they are thebearers of kings and queens. It is interesting to note that, because of their roundedshape and grey colour, they are regarded as symbols of clouds. By a twist ofmagic thought, there arose first the belief that the elephant can create clouds andthen the mythic postulate of winged elephants. A mountain-top or a cloud, el-ephant-like in outline, could represent an axis of the universe (60), and this idea—clearly primitive in origin—is probably what lies behind the use of the elephantin the Middle Ages as an emblem of wisdom (49), of moderation, of eternity, andalso of pity (8).Emblems When the use of emblems was at its most widespread (16th-18thcenturies), it was sometimes the custom to create true variations on an emblem,usually religious, basing them on the symbolic syntax. We have given a fewexamples of emblems based on the Sacred Heart.Emperor, The The fourth mystery in the Tarot pack. Here it takes theallegorical form of a figure seated upon a throne which is a cube of gold. Abovehim is a black eagle. In his hands he holds a globe of the world and a sceptresurmounted by a fleur-de-lis. The crest of his helmet includes four triangles,emblems of the four Elements. The predominantly red colour of his garmentssignifies invigorating fire, or intense activity. This Tarot mystery is closely re-lated to the image of Hercules holding his club and the golden apples which he hastaken from the garden of the Hesperides. The golden cube of the throne repre-sents the sublimation of the constructive and material principle, and the fleur-de-lis on the sceptre, illumination. In sum, then, the symbolism of this card concernsmagnificence, energy, power, law and severity; and, on the negative side, domina-tion and subjection (59).Empress, The The third enigma of the Tarot. She is shown full face, drawingherself up with hieratic stiffness. A smile plays upon her face, framed by fair hair.Her attributes are the sceptre, the fleur-de-lis and a shield with a silver eagle upona purple background (an emblem of the sublimated soul in the bosom of spiritu-ality). In the positive sense, this playing-card denotes the ideal, sweetness, domi-"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"ENIGMA97nation by affective persuasion. In the negative sense, it stands for vanity andseduction (59).Emptiness This is an abstract idea, the antithesis to the mystic concept of‘Nothingness’ (which is reality without objects and without forms yet nurturingthe seed of all things). In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, the hollow isdefined as ‘that place which is created out of the loss of the substance required forthe building of heaven’, and is thus related to space. On the sarcophagus of Seti I,there is an image of emptiness consisting of the half-full vessel of Nu (or Nou)which forms an inverted semicircle completed by a second semicircle locatedtowards one side of the first (19).Enchantment ‘Enchantment’ is a reduction to an inferior state. It is ametamorphosis in a descending direction, appearing in myths, legends and storiesas a punishment or as the work of a malign power. It may be the transformationof a person into an animal (as in the case of the story of Circe, related in theOdyssey), or into a plant or a stone, as occurs in many folktales. The enchantmentof the earth takes the form of a loss of fertility, as in Eliot’s The Waste Land,which reproduces the situation created by the sin and the wounding of Amfortasin the story of Parsifal. Enchantment can also take the form of disappearance,translation to a distant place, or illness (generally: paralysis, dumbness, blind-ness). In such cases, it represents self-punishment or a punishment from above,as we stated earlier. In ‘traditional’ tales, if the enchantment is the work of amalign power (necromancer, black magician, sorcerer, dragon, etc.), it will alwaysbe lifted by the action of a hero who providentially intervenes with his powers ofsalvation and liberation.Enclosure The walled city is also an image of the ‘spiritual centre’. Itappears to have been portrayed thus by Domenico di Michelino in his image ofDante; and it also appears frequently in this guise in the Middle Ages as the‘celestial Jerusalem’.Enigma In alchemy, the enigma alludes to the relationship between themacrocosm and the microcosm (57). This means that, so far as traditional sym-bolism goes, the enigmatic aspect of a thing is expressive of its transcendence.Eliade bears out this point with his comment that the surprising thing aboutkratophanies and theophanies is that they have their origins in primitive societ-ies—and also, we might add, in the All (17). But, more than this, since the enigmais in a way synonymous with the symbol, it also confirms the metaphysicalnature of all symbolism. The enigma is also a literary genre (frequently with anesoteric meaning), especially cultivated—along with hieroglyphics and emblems—in the 16th to 18th centuries. Some enigmas that enjoyed great standing in En-gland and Ireland in the 7th and 8th centuries must be considered as antecedents,"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"ENTANGLEMENT98as Marguerite M. Dubois has shown in La Littérature anglaise du Moyen Age(Paris, 1962).Entanglement A symbol which is related to that of the net and that of bonds.It has been used as an ornamental motif right from prehistoric times, either in theform of entanglement or of a bunch or knot of ribbons. Sometimes vegetable andanimal forms appear to rise—like grotesques—out of a mass of abstract nerve-cords resembling vegetable stalks or animated cords in the form of volutes, orcoils or knots or interlacing lines; or sometimes—and this is a more advancedmotif—clearly formed beings are shown enmeshed, as it were, in a cage. Entangle-ment-symbolism takes its place in legends, folklore and myths alongside primi-tive and Romanesque art. Thus a giant is enmeshed in trees, or the castle in theSleeping Beauty story is hidden under an inextricable mass of vegetation. Junghas studied the question of entanglement with special care, recalling that Osiris isbrought up lying in the branches of a tree which completely cover him. There isalso the Grimm tale of a girl imprisoned between the wood and the bark of a tree.Again: while he is travelling by night, Ra’s ship is engulfed by the serpent ofnight, this giving rise to a number of later mediaeval miniatures and tales. Jung alsoobserves that entanglement is often associated with the myth of the sun and itsdaily rebirth. However, this is nothing more than a variant of the devouringsymbol mentioned by Frobenius in connexion with sun-heroes (31). In the key todreams of the Hindu Yagaddeva, one reads: ‘He who while dreaming twinesround his body lianas, creepers, cords or snakeskins, string or fabrics, dies’, or, inother words, he returns to the maternal bosom (31). According to Loeffler, a thingwhich, on the psychic plane, is entangled, represents the unconscious, the re-pressed, the forgotten, the past. On the plane of cosmic evolution, it is thecollective dream which separates one cycle of life from the other (38) (Plate VIII).Erinyes, The In the classical tragedies, the erinyes sometimes appear in theform of dogs or serpents, which is an indication of their infernal character aschthonian demons (31). They personify remorse; that is, they are symbols ofguilt turned to destructiveness directed against the guilty one (15).Eternity The coins of several Roman emperors bear an allegory of eternitydepicted in the figure of a girl holding the sun and the moon in her hands. And, inalchemy, there are comparable images, alluding to the opus as a ‘conjunction’ or a‘marriage of opposites’, which illustrate the essential principle that the eternalorder can be achieved only with the abolition of antithesis, separateness andchange. Eternity has also been represented as infinite time, both in the ‘MithraicCronos’ and in the Ouroboros (the serpent or dragon which bites its own tail).The phoenix is another symbol of eternity (8)."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"EYE99Ethiops An alchemic symbol representing the nigredo or the initial stage ofthe alchemists’ work. It can be seen for example in one of the images of theSplendor solis of Solomon Trismosin (1582). The Jungian interpretation of thefigures and images of Negroes, Indians, savages, etc—whom he considers assymbols for the shadow or the darker side of the personality—does not contra-dict the first meaning, for, within the moral approach of alchemy, the nigredo isa precise illustration of the initial state of the soul before embarking upon its pathof evolution and self-perfection (32).Euphrates Specific geographical features sometimes form part of traditionalsymbols; the river Euphrates is an example. It is the equivalent of the fluidcosmos passing across the material world (or Babylon) in the two directions ofinvolution and evolution (57). In a broad sense, the river, and indeed every riverin the opinion of Heraclitus—without going into esoteric doctrine—is a symbolof time or of the irreversible nature of processes as they move onward.Eve A symbol of the material and formal aspect of life, of Natura naturans,or mother-of-all-things (57). From the spiritual point of view, Eve is the inversionof the Virgin Mary, or the mother-of-souls. Inversions of this order have some-times found a parallel expression in the contrasting use of similar names, such asEros (the god of love) balanced against Ares (war, destruction and hate). Thisantithesis between Eve and Our Lady has been examined by Antonio de Sousa deMacedo in his Eva y Ave o Maria triunfante.Excrement Gubernatis in his research into folklore, and Freud in his work inexperimental psychology, have observed that what is almost worthless is oftenassociated with what is most valued. So, for example, we find in legends andfolktales the surprising association between excrement and gold (31), a relation-ship which occurs also in alchemy, since the nigredo and the ultimate attainmentof the aurum philosophicum form the beginning and the end of the process oftransmutation. All this symbolism is contained within Nietzsche’s phrase: ‘Outof the lowest the highest reaches its peak.’Eye The essence of the question involved here is contained in the saying ofPlotinus that the eye would not be able to see the sun if, in a manner, it were notitself a sun. Given that the sun is the source of light and that light is symbolic ofthe intelligence and of the spirit, then the process of seeing represents a spiritualact and symbolizes understanding. Hence, the ‘divine eye’ of the Egyptians—adeterminative sign in their hieroglyphics called Wadza—denotes ‘He who feedsthe sacred fire or the intelligence of Man’ (28)—Osiris, in fact. Very interesting,too, is the way the Egyptians defined the eye—or, rather, the circle of the iriswith the pupil as centre—as the ‘sun in the mouth’ (or the creative Word) (8)."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"EYE100René Magritte, the surrealist painter, has illustrated this same relationship be-tween the sun and the mouth in one of his most fascinating paintings. The posses-sion of two eyes conveys physical normality and its spiritual equivalent, and itfollows that the third eye is symbolic of the superhuman or the divine. As for thesingle eye, its significance is ambivalent: on the one hand it implies the subhumanbecause it is less than two (two eyes being equated with the norm); but on theother hand, given its location in the forehead, above the place designated for theeyes by nature, it seems to allude to extra-human powers which are in fact—inmythology—incarnated in the Cyclops. At the same time the eye in the foreheadis linked up with the idea of destruction, for obvious reasons in the case of thesingle eye; but the same also applies when there is a third eye in the forehead, aswith Siva (or Shiva). This is explained by reference to one of the facets of thesymbolism of the number three: for if three can be said to correspond to theactive, the passive and the neutral, it can also apply to creation, conservation anddestruction. Heterotopic eyes are the spiritual equivalent of sight, that is, ofclairvoyance. (Heterotopic eyes are those which have been transferred anatomi-cally to various parts of the body, such as the hands, wings, torso, arms, anddifferent parts of the head, in figures of fantastic beings, angels, deities and so on.)When the eyes are situated in the hand, for example, by association with thesymbolism of the hand they come to denote clairvoyant action. An excessivenumber of eyes has an ambivalent significance which it is important to note. Inthe first place, the eyes refer to night with its myriads of stars, in the secondplace, paradoxically yet necessarily, the possessor of so many eyes is left indarkness. Furthermore, by way of corroboration, let us recall that in symbolisttheory multiplicity is always a sign of inferiority. Such ambivalences are commonin the realm of the unconscious and its projected images. Instructive in thisconnexion is the example of Argus, who with all his eyes could not escape death.The Adversary (Satan, in Hebrew) has been represented in a variety of ways,among others, as a being with many eyes. A Tarot card in the Cabinet des Estampesin Paris (Kh. 34d), for instance, depicts the devil as Argus with many eyes all overhis body. Another comparable symbolic device is also found commonly in de-monic figures: it consists of taking some part of the body that possesses, as itwere, a certain autonomy of character or which is directly associated with adefinite function, and portraying it as a face. Multiple faces and eyes implydisintegration or psychic decomposition—a conception which lies at the root of1 The Jungian idea is expressed as a pun. ‘Niña’ means both ‘daughter’ and ‘pupil (of the eye)’. Thephrase ‘Niña de los ojos’ is like the English ‘apple of one’s eye’, which gives something of the feel ofthe pun.—Translator."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"FAN101the demoniacal idea of rending apart (59). Finally, to come back to the puremeaning of the eye in itself, Jung considers it to be the maternal bosom, and thepupil its ‘child’.(1) Thus the great solar god becomes a child again, seeking renova-tion at his mother’s bosom (a symbol, for the Egyptians, of the mouth) (31).FFairies Fairies probably symbolize the supra-normal powers of the humansoul, at least in the forms in which they appear in esoteric works. Their nature iscontradictory: they fulfil humble tasks, yet possess extraordinary powers. Theybestow gifts upon the newly born; they can cause people, palaces and wonderfulthings to appear out of thin air; they dispense riches (as a symbol of wisdom).Their powers, however, are not simply magical, but are rather the sudden revela-tion of latent possibilities. Because of this, it has been possible to link the legend-ary ‘forgotten fairy’ with the Freudian ‘frustrated act’ (38). In a more traditionalsense, fairies are, objectively, spinners of thread like the Parcae; they also appearas washerwomen. They have been variously called: White Ladies, Green Ladies,Black Ladies; these are terms which tie up with the epithets applied to mediaevalknights—and for the same reason. Fairies are, in short, personifications of stagesin the development in the spiritual life or in the ‘soul’ of landscapes. Thus, inMesopotamia, they take the form of the Lady of the Plains, the Lady of theFountain and the Lady of the Water (or Damgalnunna). They are prone to suddenand complete transformations, and they bear a certain resemblance to other mys-tic beings such as sirens and lamias (in their evil aspects) (16).Fall, The The Fall signifies the incarnation of the spirit. ‘Man’, observesJakob Böhme, in De signatura, ‘died, in so far as he was purely divine essence,because his inner desires, bursting out from the inner fiery centre . . . tendedtowards external and temporary birth.’ Thus (in Evola’s transcription), the divineessence or ‘inner corporeity’ (which nevertheless persists within Man) suffersphysical ‘death’.Fan Its symbolic significance depends on the shape and size. The largeflabellate fan is related to air and wind, and is the emblem of Chung-li Chuan, thefirst of the Eight Chinese Immortals, who is said to have used it to revive thespirits of the dead (5). A fan of this type is usually heart-shaped, and is some-"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"FARMER102times decorated with feathers. The feathers stress the association with aerial andcelestial symbolism as a whole. It is an attribute of rank among several Asian andAfrican peoples, and is still so used—with a cosmic significance—by the Pope(41). The characteristic Western fan is of the folding type, and hence associatedwith the phases of the moon, so that its symbolism relates to imagination, changeand femininity. The changing pattern of phenomena, as shown in the rhythm ofmoon-phases (non-being, appearance, increase, full being, decrease), is expressedin terms of erotic, allegorical fan-language. So is the Heraclitean conception ofperpetual flux. A fan is used in this latter sense by Max Ernst in one of hispaintings.Farmer Among basic occupations, farming has a very special significance,not only because its activities take place in the sacred world of seeds, buds,flowers and fruits, but also because it follows the cosmic order as illustrated in thecalendar. Cyclic sequences of terrestrial events following the pattern of celestialmotions express a correlation which is fundamental to astrobiological thought.The farmer is therefore the guardian of agricultural rites, seeing out the ‘old year’and seeing in the ‘new’. In spiritual terms, this means that the farmer appears asthe catalyst of the forces of regeneration and salvation, forces which join everybeginning to every end, forging links which bind time together, as well as thesuccessive seasons and renascent vegetation. Farming was essential not only forthe development of primitive economy but also for the emergence of a cosmicconsciousness in Man. Mircea Eliade puts it most aptly: ‘What Man saw in thegrain, what he learnt in dealing with it, what he was taught by the example ofseeds changing their form when they are in the ground, that was the decisivelesson. . . One of the main roots of soteriological optimism was the belief ofprehistoric, agricultural mysticism that the dead, like seeds underground, canexpect to return to life in a different form’ (17).Farming See Agriculture.Father The father-image, closely linked with the symbolism of the masculineprinciple, corresponds to consciousness as opposed to the maternal implicationsof the unconscious. The symbolic representation of the father is based upon theElements of air and fire, and also heaven, light, thunderbolts and weapons (56).Just as heroism is a spiritual activity proper to the son, so dominion is the powerpeculiar to the father (17). Because of this, and also because he stands for theforce of tradition (32), he represents the world of moral commandments andprohibitions restraining the forces of the instincts (31) and subversion.Feather Whether singular or in groups, the feather symbolizes the wind andthe creator-gods of the Egyptian pantheon: Ptah, Hathor, Osiris and Amon (41).Feathers correspond to the Element of air—to the realm of the birds (48). And,"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"FEATHER103for the same reason, cultures in which aerial myths predominate, such as those ofthe American aborigines, make use of feathers as an essential feature of theirpersonal adornment. The feather head-dress of the Indian chief closely relateshim to the demiurgic bird. As a determinative sign in the Egyptian system ofhieroglyphs, the feather enters into the composition of such words as ‘empti-ness’, ‘dryness’, ‘lightness’, ‘height’, ‘flight’ (19). According to St. Gregory,feathers symbolize faith and contemplation, and the quill denotes the Word (50).The Egyptian sign for the quill signifies ‘delineator of all things’ (19), though itSymbol of the fecundity of sacrifice: the cross bears fruit(after an engraving dated 1512)."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"FECUNDITY104may be that this sign really represents a cane-leaf; however, the meaning turnsupon the function rather than the material.Fecundity In allegories, fecundity is usually represented by the poppyplant, because of its prodigious number of seeds; but it is also symbolized by agrain of barley, and by the bull, the hare and the rabbit (8).Fertility Symbols of fertility are: water, seeds, phallic shapes. Granet re-counts that, in China, the conjugal bed used to be placed in the darkest corner ofthe room, where the seeds were kept and above the spot where the dead wereburied. Eliade maintains that the respective rites pertaining to forebears, harvestsand the erotic life are so closely related to each other that it is impossible todistinguish between them (17). In Indian ritual, grains of rice serve to representthe seed of fertility (17).Fibula The fibula—or clasp—is a minimal form of shield, and, like the belt,a symbol of virginity. In this sense it has found its way into many legends,especially in the Kalevala (38).Fields In the widest sense, they signify spaciousness or limitless potentiali-ties. Into this category come the Uranian gods such as Mithras, called ‘the Lordof the Plains’. As lord of the sky, he has the task of conducting souls on theirreturn to heaven (11), like other psychopomps such as Mercury.Fight All combats are the expression of a conflict of some sort. A great manyfights, dances and simulacra are rites, or the vestiges of rites, which expresssituations of conflict. In Sweden, according to Eliade, combats are enacted onhorseback by two sets of riders personifying winter and summer. Usener ascribeda similar meaning to the combat between Xanthos and Melanthos—the fair oneand the dark one. On the other hand, the struggle may correspond to the primor-dial, cosmogonic sacrifice, such as the sacrifice of Tiamat (or Tiawath) by Marduk.Struggles between the gods of vegetation and of drought (such as Osiris and Set)or between good and evil (Ahuramazda and Ahriman or Angramainyu, for ex-ample) modify the plane of conflict accordingly. Broadly speaking, the struggle isthat of generation or involves antithetically opposed elements (17). For our part,we would suggest that the combats of Roman gladiators reflected an ancestral,mythic and symbolic background with the retiarius (or net-fighter) as the coun-terpart of Neptune and Pisces (symbolic of the celestial ocean, and the all-em-bracing god armed with the trident, as a sign of triple power, and with the net);likewise, the mirmillo was Cancer (the sun, or the son armed with a sword).Figures The representational shape of figures is always of a piece with theobject, or being, to which they allude. Symbolically speaking, a cock is the same"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"FIRE105thing as its figure whether painted, engraved or sculpted. When the figure is thatof a living being, this being provides the predominant sense, although secondarymeanings may be derived from the colour, the form, etc. When the figures aregeometric, or when they represent architectural masses, it is again the symbolismof form which comes into play. Schematic figures—marks, signs, tattoos, engrav-ings, prehistoric or primitive inscriptions, magic alphabets, etc—are all related tographic symbolism, which is founded in the main upon space, number and geo-metric form. Given the analogy, the possible similarity or inner connexion be-tween Man’s works and those of his Creator, invented figures—cultural symbolsor instruments—are always related to the natural figures which resemble them.Symbolic or mythic ideas which reveal some influence, resemblance or reminis-cence of a natural form or figure, acquire thereby powerful symbolic implications.So, for example, the head of Medusa and the octopus; the swastika and thestarfish; the double-bladed axe and the hawk in flight.Fire The Chinese, in their solar rites, utilize a tablet of red jade, which theycall Chang; it symbolizes the Element of fire (39). In Egyptian hieroglyphics, fireis also related to the solar-symbolism of the flame, and associated in particularwith the concepts of life and health (deriving from the idea of body-heat). It isalso allied with the concept of superiority and control (19), showing that thesymbol had by this time developed into an expression of spiritual energy. Thealchemists retained in particular the Heraclitean notion of fire as ‘the agent oftransmutation’, since all things derive from, and return to, fire. It is the seed whichis reproduced in each successive life (and is thereby linked with the libido andfecundity) (57). In this sense as a mediator between forms which vanish andforms in creation, fire is, like water, a symbol of transformation and regeneration.For most primitives, fire was a demiurge emanating from the sun, whose earthlyrepresentative it was; hence it is related on the one hand with the ray of light andthe lightning (35), and, on the other, with gold. Frazer lists many rites in whichtorches, bonfires, burning embers and even ashes are considered capable of stimu-lating the growth of the cornfields and the well-being of man and of animals.However, anthropological research has furnished two explanations of the fire-festival (as it persists today in the Valencian bonfires on the night of St. John,fireworks and the illuminated Christmas tree): on the one hand, there is theopinion of Wilhelm Mannhardt, to the effect that it is imitative magic purportingto assure the supply of light and heat from the sun, and, on the other, the view ofEugene Mogk and Edward Westermarck that it has as its aim the purification ordestruction of the forces of evil (21); however, these two hypotheses are not"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"FIRE-WATER106opposing but complementary. The triumphant power and the vitality of thesun—by analogy, the spirit of the shining Origin—is tantamount to victory overthe power of evil (the forces of darkness); purification is the necessary sacrificialmeans of achieving the sun’s triumph. Marius Schneider, however, distinguishesbetween two kinds of fire, depending upon their direction (or their function): fireas in the axis fire-earth (representing eroticism, solar heat and physical energy),and fire of the axis fire-air (linked with mysticism, purification or sublimation,and spiritual energy). There is an exact parallel here with the ambivalent symbol-ism of the sword (denoting both physical destruction and determination of spirit)(50). Fire, in consequence, is an image of energy which may be found at the levelof animal passion as well as on the plane of spiritual strength (56). The Heracliteanidea of fire as the agent of destruction and regeneration is reproduced in the IndianPuranas and in the Apocalypse (27). Gaston Bachelard recalls the alchemists’concept of fire as ‘an Element which operates in the centre of all things’, as aunifying and stabilizing factor. Paracelsus demonstrated the parallel between fireand life, pointing out that both must feed upon other lives in order to keep alive.To steal fire like Prometheus, or to give oneself up to fire like Empedocles, aretwo concepts which point to the basic dualism of the human predicament. Themiddle way lies in the comfortable solution of simply making material use of thebenefits of fire. But fire is ultra-life. It embraces both good (vital heat) and bad(destruction and conflagration). It implies the desire to annihilate time and tobring all things to their end. Fire is the archetypal image of phenomena in them-selves (1). To pass through fire is symbolic of transcending the human condition,according to Eliade in Myths, Dreams and Mysteries (London, 1960).Fire-water Fire-water, like other alcoholic liquors, is a coincidentiaoppositorum (water and fire) and is therefore related to noumena and to thehermaphrodite. Alcoholism, therefore, may be reckoned an attempt at conjunctio.Fish In broad terms, the fish is a psychic being, or a ‘penetrative motion’endowed with a ‘heightening’ power concerning base matters—that is, in theunconscious. Because of the close symbolic relationship between the sea and theMagna Mater, some peoples have held the fish to be sacred. There were someAsiatic rites that embraced fish-worship, and priests were forbidden to eat it. AsJung has pointed out, the son of Atargatis (Ashtart or Astarte) was named Ichthys(31). Schneider notes that the fish is the mystic Ship of Life, sometimes a whale,sometimes a bird, and at other times simply a fish or a flying fish, ‘but at all timesit is the spindle spinning out the cycle of life after the pattern of the lunar zodiac’(50). That is to say, the fish incorporates a variety of meanings, reflecting the"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"FISHER KING107many essential facets of its nature. Schneider also mentions that for some peoplethe fish has a phallic meaning, whereas for others it has a purely spiritual symbol-ism. In essence, the character of the fish is twofold: by reason of its bobbin-likeshape, it becomes a kind of ‘bird of the nether regions’, symbolic of sacrifice andof the relationship between heaven and earth. On the other hand, by virtue of theextraordinary number of its eggs, it becomes a symbol of fecundity, imparting acertain spiritual sense (50). In this last sense it is found among the Babylonians,the Phoenicians, the Assyrians (4) and the Chinese (5). There are some fish thathave a secondary significance because of their peculiar characteristics: for in-stance, the sword-fish is associated with the unicorn (32). The Chaldaic peoplesused to portray the figure of a fish with the head of a swallow, as a harbinger ofcyclic regeneration, an idea directly related to the symbolism of Pisces, the lastsign of the Zodiac (40) (Plate IX). The fish became a primitive Christian symbol,principally on the basis of the anagram drawn from the name for fish: ichthys, theinitials standing for ‘I-n6ov? X-pi6to? O-Eov Y-io? E-wtnp. Then it came to betaken as a symbol of profound life, of the spiritual world that lies under the worldof appearances, the fish representing the life-force surging up.Fish, Cosmic Like the whale and the primordial monster, the cosmic fishsymbolizes the whole of the formal, physical universe. The most striking ex-ample of this symbol is afforded by the splendid Scythian fish, made of gold,which was part of the Vettersfelde treasure, and which is now in the Museum ofBerlin. The cosmic fish can take two different but complementary symbolicforms: The first and more frequent is simply narrative and spatial, for on theupper part of its body, above a heavily marked horizontal line, are four beings ofthe ‘superior stage’—mammals (apparently they are a stag, a horse, a boar and aleopard). Below this line are beings of the ‘lower stage’—those of the deeps(fishes and sirens). The second symbolic aspect is the product of morphologicalcollation, based upon paraidolias: so, for instance, the two branches of the tail,reminiscent of two necks, constitute two sheep’s heads, while in the middle of thetail there is an eagle spreading out its wings to form an analogous shape. Its eyecomes to resemble an octopus, as much in its shape as in the implied comparisonbetween the ‘grasping’ tentacles and the potentiality for ‘grasping’ objects appar-ent in its gaze. This golden fish, then, is a symbol of the progress of the worldacross the sea of ‘unformed’ realities (or of worlds dissolved or yet unformed, orof the primordial seas).Fisher King He belongs to the legend of the Grail. According to Marx, inNouvelles Recherches sur la Littérature Arthurienne, this rôle of the mythical"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"FISHING108monarch relates him to the apostles or fishermen of the Sea of Galilee. In Robertde Boron’s work on this theme, the Fisher King becomes the Rich Fisherman,which Marx regards as confirmation of the thesis. Fishing, symbolically, is notjust ‘fishing for men’ but casting the bait into the depths of one’s own inmostnature in order to reach the gnosis.Fishing ‘The path of the Grail was marked by a number of miracles; one ofthe brothers was called Brous and was also known as “the rich fisherman” be-cause he had succeeded in catching a fish with which he had satisfied the hungerof all round him. Peter is called “the fisher of men” and the fish becomes a symbolof Christ.’ This fragment of legend, taken from Waldemar Vedel, affords a clearexplanation of the mystic sense of fishing and the fisherman, a sense which hasbeen corroborated by all students of mythology and anthropology, Schneideramong them. Fishing amounts to extracting the unconscious elements from deep-lying sources—the ‘elusive treasure’ of legend, or, in other words, wisdom. Tofish for souls is quite simply a matter of knowing how to fish in the soul. The fishis a mystic and psychic animal that lives in water (and water is symbolic ofdissolution and, at the same time, of renovation and regeneration). The fishermanis able—like the doctor—to work upon the very sources of life because of hisknowledge of these founts. This is how it comes about that Parsifal meets theKing of the Grail as a fisherman.Flag Historically speaking, the flag or banner derives from totemistic insig-nia as found in Egypt and, indeed, in most countries. The Persians carried gildedeagles with outstretched wings on top of long poles; the Medes, three crowns; theParthians, a swordblade; the Greeks and Romans had signa, standards and ban-ners. The important point about all these symbols is not the kind of figure used,but the fact that it is always placed at the top of a pole or mast. This raisedposition is expressive of a kind of imperious exaltation, or the will to ‘heighten’the spiritual significance of the figure or animal by raising it above the normallevel. From this is derived the general symbolism of the banner as a sign of victoryand self-assertion (22).Flame There are certain significant points of contact between the flame andlight. For Bachelard, the flame symbolizes transcendence itself (1), whereas lightsignifies the effect of the transcendental upon the environment. He adds that ‘Thealchemist attributed the value of gold to the fact of its being a receptacle for theElement of fire (the sun); the quintessence of gold is fire. The Greeks representedthe spirit as a gust of incandescent air’ (1)."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"FLOGGING109Fleur-de-lis An heraldic flower, non-existent in nature, which has been asymbol of royalty from the earliest times (46). As an emblem, its base is aninverted triangle representing water; above it is a cross (expressing ‘Conjunction’and spiritual achievement), with two additional and symmetrical leaves wrappedround the horizontal arm; the central arm is straight and reaches up heavenwards,the symbolism being self-evident (59). During the Middle Ages the lis was re-garded as an emblem of illumination and as an attribute of the Lord (4).Flight The symbolism of flight comprises a variety of elements. The mostbasic derives from the pleasurable sensation of movement in a medium that ismore subtle than water and unfettered by gravity. But, this apart, flying impliesraising oneself and is therefore closely connected with the symbolism of level, notonly in connexion with moral values but also with the notion of superiorityapplied to other qualities, such as power or strength. Diel has pointed out that theimportance of the ‘rise and fall’ image—as illustrated in the myth of Icarus inparticular—is corroborated by a great many authors (15). And Bachelard hasobserved that ‘of all metaphors, only those pertaining to height, ascent, depth,descent and fall are axiomatic. Nothing can explain them but they can explaineverything.’ Flight has also been conceived as the ‘transcendence of growth’.According to Toussenel, in Le Monde des oiseaux, ‘we envy the bird his goodfortune and endow with wings the object of our love, for we know by instinctthat, in the sphere of complete happiness, our bodies will enjoy the power towheel through space as the bird flies through the air’ (3). Flight is related to spaceand light; psychologically it is a symbol of thought and of imagination.Flocks A traditional symbol for the forces of the cosmos, expressive of astate which is neither chaotic nor yet completely ordered (the ordering of chaos issymbolized by the bundle or sheaf). Flocks bear an analogy with constellationsand certain stellar groups, since the moon is symbolically a shepherd—at least,this is true of some mythologies. But, at the same time, a flock implies multiplic-ity—which is a negative quality (40)—and the collapse of a force or an objective.Flogging In ancient thought, blows, flogging and flagellation do not signifypunishment (i.e. vengeance or deterrence) but purification and encouragement.The Arcadian custom of flogging the effigy of Pan when the hunters came backempty-handed was intended to cast out the inhibiting powers (21). In many ritesall over the world, flogging is considered necessary to restore possessed or be-witched individuals and, in general, to deal with all situations implying physicalor spiritual impotence (51)."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"FLOWER    110Flower Different flowers usually have separate meanings, but, as so oftenhappens, flower-symbolism is broadly characterized by two essentially differentconsiderations: the flower in its essence, and the flower in its shape. By its verynature it is symbolic of transitoriness, of Spring and of beauty. The sixth of the‘Eight Immortals’ of China, Lan Ts’ai-ho, is generally depicted clad in blue andcarrying a basket of flowers; it is said that he was given to singing of the brevityof life and the ephemeral nature of pleasure (5). The Greeks and Romans, at alltheir feasts, always wore crowns of flowers. And they would strew flowers overthe corpses as they bore them to the funeral pyre and over their graves (not somuch as an offering as an analogy) (8). We have, then, another example of anantithetical symbol, like the skeleton which the Egyptians would bring to theirbanquets, as a reminder of the reality of death and as a stimulus towards theenjoyment of life. Now, because of its shape, the flower is an image of the‘Centre’, and hence an archetypal image of the soul (56). ‘Celestial flower’ is thename given to a meteorite or a shooting star by the alchemists (57), and the flowerwas, for them, symbolic of the work of the sun (32). The significance would beadapted according to the colour of the flower. So, for example, orange or yellow-coloured flowers represent a reinforcement of the basic sun-symbolism; red flow-ers emphasize the relationship with animal life, blood and passion. The ‘blueflower’ is a legendary symbol of the impossible, and is probably an allusion to the‘mystic Centre’ as represented by the Grail and other such symbols. The ‘goldenflower’ is a famous parallel in Chinese mysticism, a non-existent flower which isalso spoken of in alchemy; in the Epistola ad Hermannum Arch. Coloniensem(Theatr. Chem. 1622) it is given the name of ‘the sapphire-blue flower of theHermaphrodite’ (32).Flute The basic meaning of the flute corresponds to erotic or funerealanguish. The complexity of its symbolism derives from the fact that, if, by virtueof its shape, it seems to have a phallic significance, its tone is nevertheless relatedto inner, feminine intuitive feeling (that is, to the anima) (50). It is also related tothe cane and to water.Fool, The The final enigma of the Tarot, distinguished from the othersbecause it is un-numbered—all the rest are given numbers from 1 to 21; thesignificance of this is that the Fool is to be found on the fringe of all orders andsystems in the same way as the Centre of the Wheel of Transformations is‘outside’ movement, becoming and change. This very fact is in itself a pointer tothe mystic symbolism of the Fool, as it is touched upon in the Parsifal legend andothers. This figure on the Tarot card is dressed in a costume of many coloursdenoting the multiple or incoherent influences to which he is subject. The red"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"FOOT111colour tends to orange, indicating—and this is unequivocal—the colour of theessential fire within him. He carries a bag at the end of his staff, this beingsymbolic of the mind and its burden. A white lynx is shown in the act of biting hisleft calf (left being the unconscious side), signifying what remains of his lucid-ity—that is, his remorse. But this does not deter him, rather does it urge himonward towards the background where may be seen an overturned obelisk—asolar symbol and also symbolic of the Logos—and a crocodile about to devourwhat must be returned to chaos. There is nothing definite to suggest that the Foolcannot be saved: on the contrary, his predicament, as we have described it, isbalanced by the presence of a small, purple-coloured tulip (expressive of activespirituality) and a gold belt adorned with twelve plaques alluding to the Zodiac.This Tarot enigma corresponds, in short, to the irrational, the active instinctcapable of sublimation, but related at the same time to blind impulse and theunconscious (59). For Schneider, the mythic and legendary Fool is closely relatedto the clown. In their medicinal ceremonies and rites, doctor and patient ‘actmad’, and, through frenzied dancing and ‘extravagances’, they try to invert theprevailing evil order. The logic of the process is clear enough: when the normal orconscious appears to become infirm or perverted, in order to regain health andgoodness it becomes necessary to turn to the dangerous, the unconscious and theabnormal (51). Further, the Fool and the clown, as Frazer has pointed out, playthe part of ‘scapegoats’ in the ritual sacrifice of humans.Foot In all probability, the foot is to be taken as an ambivalent symbol. ForJung, it is what confirms Man’s direct relationship with the reality of the earth,and he considers that it is frequently phallic in significance (31). Ania Teillardpoints out that, like the hand, it is an essential part of the body and the supportof one’s entire person; she recalls that in the mythology of a number of countriesthe rays of the sun are compared with the feet, as witness the figure of theswastika (56). But Diel makes the revolutionary assertion that the foot is asymbol of the soul, possibly because it serves as the support of the body in thesense of keeping man upright. He quotes examples which show that, in Greeklegends, lameness usually symbolizes some defect of the spirit—some essentialblemish. Jung corroborates this, observing that Hephaestus, Wieland the Black-smith and Mani all had deformed feet (31). May it not be that certain talents aregiven to men to compensate for some physical defect? Schneider has indicated theheel as the ‘area of vulnerability and of attack’ in the foot. It is the heel thatscotches the serpent or that is wounded by it (as with Achilles, Sigurd, Krishna)(50). According to Aigremont, ‘the shoe, like the foot and the footprint, has alsoa funereal implication. In a sense, a dying man “is going away”. There is no"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"FOOTPRINTS112evidence of his going away save his last footmarks. This sombre symbolism isillustrated, possibly, in the monuments characteristic of the Roman Empire, and,beyond question, in primitive Christian art. . . .’ (And also, we might add, inGothic art. The passage is quoted by Stekel.)Footprints Footprints symbolize the way of gods, saints or demonic spirits,etc. There are footprints of Buddha and Vishnu all over India. Kühn, in The RockPictures of Europe, says that the footprints of the Virgin Mary may be seen in achapel in Würzburg; and the footprints of Christ in a hermitage in Rosenstein,Swabia.Footwear A sign of liberty amongst the ancients, since slaves walked bare-foot (46). Its symbolic meaning is linked with that of the foot, from which itacquires its general symbolic characteristics. Given the triple symbolism of thefoot—(1) phallic according to the Freudians, (2) symbolic of the soul according toDiel, and (3) signifying, in our opinion, the relationship as well as the point ofcontact between the body and the earth—it follows that footwear partakes of allthree potentialities, together with the general symbolism of level.Ford This is an aspect of threshold-symbolism (q.v.), denoting the dividing-line between two states or two forms of reality, such as consciousness andunconsciousness, or waking and sleeping. Jung has drawn attention to the highlyinteresting fact that, in the exploits of Hiawatha, his victims are nearly always inthe water or close to it. Every animal that rises out of a ford is a representation ofthe forces of the unconscious, like some demonic being or metamorphosed magi-cian (31).Forest Within the general symbolism of landscape, forests occupy a notableplace, and are often found in myths, legends and folktales. Forest-symbolism iscomplex, but it is connected at all levels with the symbolism of the female prin-ciple or of the Great Mother. The forest is the place where vegetable life thrivesand luxuriates, free from any control or cultivation. And since its foliage obscuresthe light of the sun, it is therefore regarded as opposed to the sun’s power and asa symbol of the earth. In Druid mythology, the forest was given to the sun inmarriage (49). Since the female principle is identified with the unconscious inMan, it follows that the forest is also a symbol of the unconscious. It is for thisreason that Jung maintains that the sylvan terrors that figure so prominently inchildren’s tales symbolize the perilous aspects of the unconscious, that is, itstendency to devour or obscure the reason (31). Zimmer stresses that, in contrastwith the city, the house and cultivated land, which are all safe areas, the forestharbours all kinds of dangers and demons, enemies and diseases (60). This is why"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"FOX113forests were among the first places in nature to be dedicated to the cult of thegods, and why propitiatory offerings were suspended from trees (the tree being,in this case, the equivalent of a sacrificial stake) (8).Fossil Broadly, its symbolic significance corresponds to that of the stone,but, because of its ambivalent character, it embraces the concepts of time andeternity, life and death, the evolution of species, and their petrification.Fountain (or Source) In the image of the terrestrial Paradise, four rivers areshown emerging from the centre, that is, from the foot of the Tree of Life itself, tobranch out in the four directions of the Cardinal Points. They well up, in otherwords, from a common source, which therefore becomes symbolic of the ‘Centre’and of the ‘Origin’ in action. Tradition has it that this fount is the fons juventutiswhose waters can be equated with the ‘draught of immortality’—amrita in Hindumythology (25). Hence it is said that water gushing forth is a symbol of the life-force of Man and of all things (57). For this reason, artistic iconography veryfrequently uses the motif of the mystic fount; it is also to be found in Mithraism—a Pannonian votive inscription reads: fonti perenni (31). There can be no doubtthat its significance as the mystic ‘Centre’ is confirmed and reinforced when it isportrayed in architectural plans: whether in the cloister, the garden or the patio,the fountain occupies the centre position, at least in the majority of architecturalworks built during periods within the symbolist tradition, as in Romanesque orGothic edifices. Furthermore, the four rivers of Paradise are denoted by fourpaths which radiate out from the region of the cloister towards a clear space,circular or octagonal in shape, which forms the basin of the fountain; this basin isusually shaped, again, like a circle or an octagon, and sometimes there is a doublebasin. Jung has devoted much time to the study of fountain-symbolism, speciallyin so far as it concerns alchemy, and, in view of how much lies behind it, he isinclined to the conclusion that it is an image of the soul as the source of inner lifeand of spiritual energy. He links it also with the ‘land of infancy’, the recipient ofthe precepts of the unconscious, pointing out that the need for this fount arisesprincipally when the individual’s life is inhibited and dried up (32). The Jungianinterpretation is particularly apt when the symbol concerns a fountain centrallyplaced in a garden, the central area then being a representation of the Selbst orindividuality. He mentions as examples: the ‘fountain of life’ of the FlorentineCodex Spherae, and the Garden of Delight painted by Hieronymus van Aecken(Bosch). He observes that the fountain, in the enclosed garden in the Ars Symbolicaof Bosch (1702), signifies strength in adversity, and that the central area may beregarded as a temenos (a hallowed area) (32) (Plate X)."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"FOX      114Fox A common symbol for the devil during the Middle Ages, expressive ofbase attitudes and of the wiles of the adversary (20).Fracture In general, any state of matter or of form carries a literal symbolismwhich simply transposes to the mental, spiritual or psychic world the corre-sponding physical phenomenon. One can see a clear illustration here of the par-allel between the two realms of the visible and the invisible. Naturally, the sym-bolic significance of the object is broadened in consequence. So, for example, abroken column takes its significance from the idea of fracture rather than thenotion of the column as such—symbolically, it is the precise equivalent of thestunted tree. Charred wood, rusty iron, lichencovered rocks are repellent to peopleof a certain temperament while the same things are attractive to others of aromantic nature precisely because they symbolize the ‘conjunction of opposites’or the interplay of positive and negative forces. A fracture may reach the stage ofabsolute destruction when it becomes symbolic of spiritual ruin or death, as in thecase of The Fall of the House of Usher by Poe. Giorgione, in his mysteriouspainting of The Storm, portrays two broken columns on a pedestal, which, ac-cording to the Freudian interpretation, would signify a critical sexual conflict. Butwe would rather interpret the picture as an illustration of the break-up of a unifiedwhole (as symbolized by the number two), and this interpretation would seem tobe confirmed by the fact that the man is separated spatially from the woman: heis in the left foreground of the painting in an attitude expressive of wandering,with the woman on the right, a stream flowing between them, and a flash oflightning, together with two columns, above. Thus, all physical fragmentation issymbolic of destruction and disintegration. Nevertheless, there are instances whenthe break-up may be positive in character in that it symbolizes a possible way ofescape. The Roman Flamen Dialis was not permitted to wear knots in any partof his garments, nor any bangle that was not split (21). The knots and bangles,bands or necklaces would here symbolize the various kinds of bondage that thepriest had to rise above (Plate XI).Frog The frog represents the transition from the Element of earth to that ofwater, and vice versa. This connexion with natural fecundity is an attribute de-rived from its amphibious character (50), and for the same reason it is also a lunaranimal; there are many legends which tell of a frog on the moon, and it figures inmany rites invoking rainfall (17). In Egypt, it was an attribute of Herit, thegoddess who assisted Isis in her ritual resurrection of Osiris. The little frogswhich appeared in the Nile a few days before it overflowed its banks were,therefore, regarded as heralds of fertility (39). According to Blavatsky, the frog"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"GARGOYLES115was one of the principal beings associated with the idea of creation and resurrec-tion, not only because it was amphibious but because of its alternating periods ofappearance and disappearance (phases which likewise characterise all lunar ani-mals). Frog-gods were once placed upon mummies and the early Christians incor-porated them into their symbolic system (9). The toad is the antithesis of thefrog, as the wasp is of the bee. Jung rounds off all this with his comment that,given its anatomy, the frog, more than any other of the cold-blooded animals,anticipates Man; And Ania Teillard recalls that in the centre of his picture of TheTemptation of St. Anthony, Bosch places a frog, with the head of a very agedhuman being, poised upon a platter held up by a Negress. Here it represents thehighest stage of evolution. Hence, the frequency of the ‘transformation of princeinto frog’ in legends and folktales (56).Fruit Equivalent to the egg, in traditional symbolism, for in the centre of thefruit is the seed which represents the Origin (29). It is a symbol of earthly desires.GGarden The garden is the place where Nature is subdued, ordered, selectedand enclosed. Hence, it is a symbol of consciousness as opposed to the forest,which is the unconscious, in the same way as the island is opposed to the ocean.At the same time, it is a feminine attribute because of its character as a precinct(32). A garden is often the scene of processes of ‘Conjunction’ or treasure-hunts—connotations which are clearly in accord with the general symbolic function wehave outlined. A more subtle meaning, depending upon the shape and disposition,or the levels and orientation, of the garden, is one which corresponds to the basicsymbolism of landscape (q.v.).Gargoyles Fabulous animals and monsters make their appearance in mediae-val religious art as symbols of the forces of the cosmos, or as images of thedemoniacal and dragon-infested underworld; in the latter case they are captiveanimals—prisoners under the sway of a superior spirituality. This is shown bytheir position in the hierarchy of the ornamentation: they are always subordi-nated to angelic, celestial images (16). They never occupy the centre."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"GARLAND    116Garland It has been said (37) that everything in the universe is linked as ina garland; the observation may serve as a pointer to the actual symbolic signifi-cance of the garland. It is related to the grotesque, to the rosette, to string and allother tokens of bonds or connexion. The uses to which the garland has been putprovide us with further definitions of its symbolism. The ancients would hangthem at the entrance to their temples on feast-days, as a symbol of fellowship;and they used also to crown their captives with them (8). Here, as also in the caseof the crowns worn by the guests at Egyptian, Greek and Roman banquets, it isthe symbolism of the flower which prevails (signifying ephemeral beauty and thedualism or life and death).Gazelle This animal is an emblem of the soul. From Primitive times it hasbeen depicted in iconography in flight from—or in the jaws of—a lion or apanther. It symbolizes the persecution of the passions and the aggressive, self-destructive aspect of the unconscious.Gemini, The As the third sign of the Zodiac, these heavenly twins take onthe general significance of all symbolic twins (in that they are both divine andmortal, black and white), but the Gemini acquire the additional significance of acharacteristic phase of the cosmic process as symbolized in the Wheel of Trans-formations: the moment, that is to say, in which pure creative force (Aries andTaurus) is severed into two parts, in such a way that one side of the dualism iselevated but the other descends into the multiplicity characteristic of phenomena.The pillars of Hermes, or those of Hercules, or the so-called Jachin and Boazcolumns of the Cabala, are all symbols deriving from the great myth of theGemini. In the zodiacal symbolism, the third sign is that of the objectivized andreflected intellect (40). Marius Schneider has made a profound study of theGemini-myth in megalithic culture, showing that it has two tendencies, one whiteand the other black; one creates, the other destroys; both these characteristics areindicated by the arms of each of the Twins, which, in landscape symbolism, areidentical with the river of youth and the river of death. The Gemini representcreative Nature (Natura naturans) and created Nature (Natura naturata), and thisZodiacal sign ofthe Gemini"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"GEMINI, THE117duality is sometimes illustrated in tales by a being that wears a mask, or by aProtean being capable of turning into a giant, a man or an animal. In medicinalrites, the Gemini, by virtue of their double but constant nature, are both thedoctor and—more particularly—the invalid, as is borne out in legend and inmyth—the Parsifal story, for example (Jean Arthur Rimbaud unknowingly al-luded to this duality when he remarked that the poet is both the great invalid andthe seer) (51). At times, two different conceptions of the Gemini can be distin-guished (as in the parallel myth of the primordial and androgynous being): the‘Heavenly Twin’, expressive of opposites, fused together and integrated intoOneness (represented by the spherical or perfect being); and the ‘Earthly Twin’displaying the break, the split (as in two-headed Janus, or triform Hecate, etc.),that is, opposites in conflict or at least in dissidence. There is a third aspect,which is that of the individuation or splitting of the ‘double being’, but this has todo with the existential order and not the mythic. As a result of the dynamictendencies of all contradictions (white tends towards black, night seeks to be-come day, the evil man aspires to goodness, life leads to death), the world ofphenomena becomes a system of perpetual inversions, illustrated, for example, inthe hour-glass which turns upon its own axis in order to maintain its inner move-ment: that of the sand passing through the central aperture—the ‘focal point’ ofits inversion. The Gemini, in essence a symbol of opposites, is, in its dynamicaspect, then, a symbol of Inversion. According to the megalithic conception—andhere we are following Schneider—the mountain of Mars (or Janus) which rises upas a mandorla of the Gemini is the locale of Inversion—the mountain of death andresurrection; the mandorla is another sign of Inversion and of interlinking, for it isformed by the intersection of the circle of earth with the circle of heaven. Thismountain has two peaks, and every symbol or sign alluding to this ‘situation ofInversion’ is marked by duality or by twin heads. Two-headed eagles and cocksare also to be found in this context, the general symbolism of which is that ofalternating contradiction; positive/negative, or low/high-pitched. All these aresymbols of the harmonious ambiguity of ‘thesis and antithesis, paradise andinferno, love and hate, peace and war, birth and death, praise and insult, clarityand obscurity, scorching rocks and swamps, surrounding the fountains and wa-ters of salvation. Here, gay matters are discussed in grave tones, and the mosttragic events are joked about’ (50). If this cosmic situation were worked out inpsychological terms, it would mean that the ‘zone of contradiction’ would be-come the threshold of unifying and unified mysticism. This would explain theabundance of contradictory epithets in the most sublime poetry, and the extraor-dinary richness of paradox in the deepest thinkers, such as Lao-Tse. Also corre-sponding to the mystery of the Gemini is the morphological fact that in every"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"GIANT118individual object there are two formal components, one varying, the other un-varying. In other words, one of its faces bespeaks its individuality, the other linksit with its species (Plate XII).Giant The deepest and most ancient meaning of the myth of the giant alludesto the supposed existence of an immense, primordial being, by whose sacrificecreation was brought forth. This cosmogonic myth was very common amongprimitive and ancient peoples, and it shows how rites involving the sacrifice ofhumans are an attempt to revive the initial sacrifice and to resuscitate the cosmicforces or to reawaken, at least, their favourable proclivities (17). Now, the giantis, in himself, neither good nor bad, but merely a quantitative amplification of theordinary; hence, as the case may be, there are some legendary giants who areprotectors and others who are aggressive. This sense of the giant as ‘that whichsurpasses’ human stature (here symbolic of power and strength), is also indica-tive of the broad significance of the giant. He may be an image of the ‘TerribleFather’, arising from childhood memories—children see their parents as giants—or an image of the unconscious, the ‘dark side’ of the personality menacing theJungian Selbst (21), etc. It is interesting to note that in folklore the giant is tutelarin character: he is usually the defender of the common people against the over-lord, upholding their liberties and rights. Without generalizing, one implication ofthe giant may be said to be the personification of collective Man—as implied inthe maxim ‘united we stand’—or of the life of a community (16). But the generalmyth of the giant is far from being confined to this specialized meaning. In nearlyall symbolic traditions, he tends to appear as an outcropping of the marvellousand the terrible, even though he always has a certain quality of the inferior or thesubordinate about him. The Bible refers to Goliath and to Og, king of Bashan atthe time of the exodus (46). Samson has certain characteristics of the giant. In theWest, Bodo, Rübezahl, Geryon, Gargantua and Hercules are the most significantin gigantomachy; in Greek tradition, there are the Titans and the Cyclops. Chris-tian tradition has often seen Satan as a giant (50). The tragic hero is intimatelylinked with the giant, although, at times, in inverse relation as his adversary (60).Frazer describes the numerous cases in which giant figures in wood or wicker-work were set fire to during midsummer festivals, comparable with the Valencianfallas (or bonfires). The ancients would fill these figures with animals and evenlive men, who were burnt with the effigy. They were considered as representa-tives of the spirit of vegetation, or of the god sacrificed to the world—whichbrings us back once again to our cosmogonic interpretation. The giant may be asymbol of ‘everlasting rebellion’, of the forces of dissatisfaction which growwithin Man and determine his history and his destiny; it may, that is to say, be asymbol of the Universal Man (Adam Kadmon, 21). Now, according to Jungian"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"GOG AND MAGOG119psychology, the giant’s essence—or his appearance, rather—seems to corre-spond to the father-symbol, representing the spirit that withstands the instincts,or as the guardian of the treasure (that is, the mother—the unconscious), in whichcase it is identical with the dragon-symbol. Reviewing all this, Jung quotes theexample of Humbaba, the guardian of the garden of Ishtar in the Gilgamesh epic(31).Globe The sphere is a whole, and hence it underlies the symbolic significanceof all those images which partake of this wholeness, from the idea of the mystic‘Centre’ (56) to that of the world and eternity (8), or, more particularly, of theworld-soul (4). In neoplatonic philosophy, the soul is explicitly related to theshape of the sphere, and the substance of the soul is deposited as quintessencearound the concentric spheres of the four Elements. The same is true of theprimordial man of Plato’s Timaeus (32). In alchemy, the globe, when it is black incolour, is a symbol of prime matter, or it may be depicted with wings to implyspiritual movement or evolution—as, for example, in the Philosophia Reformataof Mylius (1622) (32). Another important association is that of perfection andfelicity. The absence of corners and edges is analogous to the absence of inconve-niences, difficulties and obstacles.Gloves Gloves, since they are worn on the hands, derive their symbolismfrom them. Of special interest is the right-hand glove, on account of the ceremo-nial custom of removing it when one approaches a person of higher rank, or analtar, or the Lord. This custom has twin symbolic roots: in so far as it implies aglove of mail, it signifies disarming oneself before one’s superior; at the same time,since the right hand pertains to the voice and to the rational side of Man, it is acustom which suggests candour and the frank disclosure of one’s mind.Goblet (or Drinking-cup) In Romanesque times, and especially when, as achalice, it was furnished with a lid, it was a symbol of the human heart (14). In abroader sense it is, like the coffer and the chest, a notable symbol of containing.To a certain extent it may be seen as a material expression of the surrounds of‘wrapping’ around the mystic Centre. An important secondary meaning, in addi-tion to the main symbolism of containing, is derived from the symbolism of theparticular liquids which can be contained in goblets, glasses or chalices, andexpressive of the non-formal world of possibilities (4). This is the explanation ofthe fact that hydromancy is practized with crystal or glass vessels which aresupposed to have the power of talismans (57).Gog and Magog They signify respectively the king and the people, as inEzekiel, where the people of the North-East of Asia Minor are specifically calledthe enemies of God. This meaning still persists among the Moslems (46)."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"GOLD      120Gold In Hindu doctrine, gold is the ‘mineral light’. According to Guénon, theLatin word for gold—aurum—is the same as the Hebrew for light—aor (26).Jung quotes the delightful explanation offered by the alchemist Michael Maier inDe Circulo Physico Quadrato to the effect that the sun, by virtue of millions ofjourneys round the earth (or conversely) has spun threads of gold all round it.Gold is the image of solar light and hence of the divine intelligence. If the heart isthe image of the sun in man, in the earth it is gold (32). Consequently, gold issymbolic of all that is superior, the glorified or ‘fourth state’ after the first threestages of black (standing for sin and penitence), white (remission and innocence)and red (sublimation and passion). Everything golden or made of gold tends topass on this quality of superiority to its utilitarian function. Chrysaor, the magicsword of gold, symbolizes supreme spiritual determination. Gold is also theessential element in the symbolism of the hidden or elusive treasure which is anillustration of the fruits of the spirit and of supreme illumination.Golden Fleece This is one of the symbols denoting the conquest of theimpossible or the ultra-reasonable (32). Since the sheep is symbolic of innocenceand gold represents supreme spirituality and glorification, the Golden Fleecesignifies that the quest of the Argonauts was for supreme strength of spiritthrough purity of soul—that quality which distinguished Sir Galahad, the medi-aeval Knight of the Holy Grail. It is, in consequence, one of the most advancedforms within the general symbolism of treasure (15).Goose Like the duck, gander or swan, the goose is a beneficent animalassociated with the Great Mother and with the ‘descent into hell’. It is very oftenfound in folktales (Mother Goose, Grimm’s tales, etc.). It is linked with destinyas is proven by the ‘goose game’, a profane offshoot of the symbol in space-time,representing the dangers and fortunes of existence, prior to the return to thematernal bosom.Gorgon According to Frobenius, the gorgon is a symbol of the fusion ofopposites: the lion and the eagle, the bird and the serpent, mobility and immobil-ity (as in the swastika), beauty and horror (22).

Basically, it embraces two different symbols, but it involves others too.The two main symbols are that of the Grail proper, and that of the quest.According to the Western legend (the Fisher King), a mysterious illness (sym-"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"GRAIL, THE121bolic, like that of Philoctetes) has stricken down the ancient monarch, the keeperof the Grail’s secret. And in this rhythm and on this level everything around himis wilting like the peccant King himself (this being the theme of Poe’s Fall of theHouse of Usher and of Eliot’s Waste Land). The animals are declining, the treesbear no fruit, the fountains have ceased to play. Day and night, physicians andknights tend the ailing monarch. Sir Parsifal questions the king forthrightly: Whereis the Grail? Instantly, the king rises and Nature is regenerated (18). The SwissKnight Templar, Wolfram von Eschenbach, the author of Parsifal, locates theaction in Gaul, on the borders of Spain, where the hero Titurel has founded atemple for the preservation of the chalice of the Last Supper (27). It is said thatthe Grail came from the East and there it must return (32), which is a clear allusionto its significance as the ‘source of illumination’. The cup itself has its ownsymbolism, but there is a legend which tells how it was fashioned by angels froman emerald that dropped from Lucifer’s forehead when he was hurled into theabyss. Thus, just as the Virgin Mary redeems the sin of Eve, so the blood of theRedeemer redeems through the Grail the sin of Lucifer. This emerald, as Guénonhas shown, is reminiscent of the urnâ, the pearl fixed to the forehead which, inHindu symbolism, is the third eye of Siva (or Shiva), representing the ‘sense ofeternity’. The loss of the Grail is tantamount to the loss of one’s inner adhe-sions, whether they are religious ties or—in the degraded (that is, the psycho-logical) forms of the mystery—some other ‘source of happiness’. Hence, thislapse of memory entails the loss of the primordial or paradisical state, as well asthe death and withering up of Nature (that is, of one’s own spiritual life). TheGrail signifies at once a vessel (grasale) and a book (gradale). The quest, on theother hand, concerns, broadly speaking, the ‘treasure hunt’, which is actuallythe inversion of the endless chase of the ‘Accursed Hunter’, since the latterpursues phenomenal forms in their constant interplay of being and non-being,whereas the Grail implies, above all, the quest for the mystic ‘Centre’—the‘unmoved mover’, of Aristotle, or the ‘unvarying mean’ in Far Eastern tradition(28). The appearance of the Grail in the centre of the Round Table, round whichare seated the Knights, closely parallels, in the symbolism of its form, theChinese image of heaven (Pi), which is shaped like a circle with a hole (analo-gous with cup or chalice) in the middle. Ms. Fr. 112 of the Bibliothèque Nationalein Paris, Lancelot du Lac, depicts the moment in which the Grail is placed bytwo angels in the centre of the mystic Round Table (Plate XIII). One of themost widespread legends relates the Grail to the cup or plate in which Josephof Arimathea caught the blood of Christ nailed to the Cross.

As Shukrâshârya has said with such lyric fervour: ‘The character of theimage is determined by the relationship between the worshipper and the wor-shipped’; in this he is unconsciously echoing the biologist’s definition of form as‘the diagram between the inner urge of a body and the resistance of the (physical)medium’. In Hindu doctrine, beauty is the result not of external characteristicsbut of the emanation of a spiritual attitude; and the same is true of other aspectsof form, such as direction, order, arrangement, or the number of components.German mystics, as Luc Benoist recalls (6), have also applied themselves toshape (both in the round and diagrammatically) as a manifestation of the spirit.As Anna Katerina Emmerich observed: ‘Nothing is pure form. Everything issubstance and action, by virtue of signs.’ The symbol as crystallized in creativeart involves a high degree of condensation, deriving from its inherent economy ofform and allusive power. This, then, is the psychological basis of the symbolismof graphics (the basis of the magical interpretation is to be sought in the literalinterpretation of the theory of correspondences). It underlies the graphic sym-bolism of amulets, talismans, pentacles and divinatory signs from prehistorictimes right up to the present day. Hence the strong and perfectly justified attrac-tion exerted by certain shapes, emblems, flags, coats of arms, marks and medals,based not upon convention, as is usually suggested, but upon inner bonds ofsymbolic ‘common rhythms’ (30). Quite apart from their function as integratingor synoptic symbols, graphic symbols possess a singular mnemonic power, asSchneider has shown. He points to the fact that such figures as the spiral, theswastika, the circle with a central point, the lunar crescent, the double sigma, etc.,were capable of conveying the most varied of philosophical, alchemical or astro-nomic data—a technique of interpretation capable of applying all the informationsupplied by these three disciplines to a single plane of significance. Any one givenfigure (with its series of multivalencies—that is, embracing several meaningswhich are not irrelevant or equivocal) varies in appearance and in significancewith the ‘rhythm-symbol’ (that is, the idea and the intended direction) pervadingit. Schneider adds, in connexion with Tanew’s Das Ornament die Elbetiza (Ipek,1942), that this constitutes one of the predominant features of ancient art, which‘is often unfortunately called decorative or ornamental art’ (51). To enumeratesome of the fields of activity which have been profoundly influenced by graphicsymbolism: mythological attributes and figures, signs in astronomy and astrol-ogy, alchemy, magic and primitive mysticism, religions, heraldry, fabulous figuresand monsters, ornaments, signs of diverse offices, numismatic signs, marks on"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"GRAPHICS126porcelain, watermarks, etc. (36). If we pause to consider the prodigious varietyoffered by only one of these categories—ornaments, for example—it will becomeapparent that even a rough inventory of the symbolic ramifications would beimpracticable here for material reasons. And we could add further headings: al-phabets, for example, or ideographs, pictographs, metagraphs and mandalas, aswell as graphic artistic compositions, embracing abstract painting for example,which—like Celtic, Anglo-Saxon and Nordic ornamental art—provides an un-ceasing flow of significant forms, expressed willy-nilly, for Man is quite inca-pable of creating anything which does not bear the marks of his subtle, urgent andall-embracing need for communication. To widen now the scope of this exposi-tion, let us consider the lapidary signs to be found in the stones of many architec-tural edifices. A great many kinds of different marks have been catalogued, and,without doing violence to their esoteric meaning, we may group them, as follows,into: initial letters, anagrams, astrological, numerical, magic or mystico-Christiansigns, or marks pertaining to associations or groups, or to building, or to nation-ality or race, or to benefactors, etc.In ornamentation, Greek frets, wavy lines, series of spirals, coils of varyingrhythms, sigmas, X-shapes, diamonds, circles, ovals, arrows, triangles, zigzags,triskeles and swastikas are all graphic shapes which, in symbolism, are groupedunder the general heading of ‘cosmic background’, because they are all in effectsymbols of the activity of natural forces and of the four Elements (41). In varyingdegrees, depending upon the period and personal or cultural prejudice, scholarsresearching into the history and pre-history of art—since few of them have takenany interest in the autonomous doctrine of symbolism—have either lumpedthese graphic symbols together as sun-symbols, or else as symbols of the hurri-cane and the heavens. J. Déchelette, for example, says in his Manuel d’Archéologiepréhistorique that all the signs concerning dual, bilateral symmetry or the irradi-ating Centre ‘were employed as images of the sun from the Bronze Age onwards’.We must not fail to mention one important fact, and that is the connexion of thesymbolism of form with divination. The Chinese Pa Kua—whose system isdescribed in the I Ching (The Book of Changes)—the random dots of geomancy,and the innumerable ‘-mancies’ which have come down to us from Antiquity in agreat many works upon the subject, are all founded for the most part upon thesymbolism of form; this can be seen both in the identification of a given ‘matricalshape’ with the figure of a particular being (as happens in the case of Rorschach’stests with ink-blots) whose symbolic implications will determine the augury, andin the splitting up of a shape into its numerical components and its tendencytowards a particular direction in space, in which case its symbolic sense is deter-mined by the significance of the numbers and the space-zone associated with it."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"GRAPHICS127Frazer, for example, describes the Chinese belief that the life and destiny of a cityis so influenced by its shape that its fortunes must vary according to the characterof the thing which that shape most nearly resembles; and he relates that, long ago,the town of Tsuen-cheu-fu, the outlines of which were like those of a carp,frequently fell a prey to the depredations of the neighbouring city of Yung-chun,which was shaped like a fishing-net (21).Jung has shown great interest in the question of graphic symbolism, geomet-ric diagrams and numbers determined by the quantitative factor of componentelements, without, however, working up his interesting—and valid—findingsand conclusions into a comprehensive theory. He observes, for example, that therelationships between number and shape depend not only upon the quantity ofthe elements but also upon their individual shape and direction, because thedirection influences the quantitative factor in the same way as fracture does. Byway of illustration, he mentions that in the ninth key of the Duodecim ClavesFratris Basilii Valentini (in Museum Hermeticum, Frankfurt, 1678) there is aninstance of triunity appearing as unity, realized by splitting a Y-sign in the centre,so that it becomes three strokes; and another of duality as a quaternary, byforming a four-armed cross not with four lines but with two independent butcounterbalancing right angles, so that they can be said to be two components byvirtue of their continuity but four from the point of view of their direction. Hecomments also upon the fact that irregular quadrilaterals are expressive of thetendency in the equilibrium of the symbolism of the number four to adapt itselfin conformity with the direction of the major axis. If the horizontal line is pre-dominant, then it reveals the superiority of the merely rational intellect, whereasif the vertical line prevails then it denotes spiritual non-rationalism. The sign ofthe conjunction of the quaternary (the cross or the square) with unity is ex-pressed through the union of the numbers four and one, that is, of the square (orthe cross) and the circle. The relationship between two intersecting diameters andthe circumference is emphasized by sometimes depicting the centre visibly as asmall circle symbolic of the mystic ‘Centre’. The figure thus arrived at is of greatsymbolic value: it expresses the original Oneness (symbolized by the centre), the‘way out to the manifest world’ (the four radii, which are the same as the fourrivers which well up from the fons vitae or from the foot of the Cosmic Tree inParadise), and the return to Oneness (the outer circumference) through the circu-lar movement which ‘smooths away’ the corners of the square (these cornersimplying the differentiation characteristic of the multiplicity and the transitorinessof the world of phenomena). By adding a further cross, shaped like an X, to thisfigure, the wheel is obtained; and the wheel is the commonest symbol of the"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"GRAPHICS128‘Centre’ and of the cycle of transformations. The importance of the relationshipbetween the circle and the square is quite extraordinary; religious and symbolic artas well as profane works provide us with a great variety of shapes incorporatingboth the circle and the square. But to limit ourselves to religious symbolism, let usquote two instances which are entirely unrelated yet produce the same result:first, the so-called ‘pentacle of Laos’, a squared figure with a small square at itscentre and four circles inside the angles, each divided into four internally; andsecondly, the retable in the Cartuja de Miraflores (the Carthusian monastery nearBurgos), which is arranged in a similar pattern, but incorporates figures of thePantokrator and of tetramorphs. The underlying logico-symbolic force of suchfigures is so strong that, when one has recourse to an abstract image of a cosmicorder, capable of expressing the intimate and intense relationship between the‘two worlds’, one turns inevitably to this coniunctio joining the symbol for earth(the square) with that for heaven (the circle). The fact that figures incorporatingthe irradiant ‘Centre’ are cosmic symbols of the ultimate destiny of the spiritaccounts for the fact that they are also psychological images of this same destiny,that is, of its presentiment and of the way of fulfilling it—in short, of the mysticidea of consummation (32). Hence, psychoanalysts have noted that the joining ofthe square with the circle (in such forms as the star, the rose, the lotus, concentriccircles, the circle with a visible central point, etc.) is symbolic of the final stage inthe process of individuation, or, in other words, of that phase of spiritual devel-opment when imperfections (irregular shapes) have been eliminated, as have allearthly desires (represented by malignant, biological symbols of monsters andwild beasts), for the sake of concentrating upon the achievement of Oneness anda vision of Paradise (such as that described by Dante at the end of his master-piece) (56).Other conclusions of Jung concerning the psychology of shapes are these:opposites are symbolized by a cross (signifying inner urges) and by a square(standing for the horizon); the process of rising above these urges is symbolizedby the circle (33); exact duplication implies confirmation, but when the twosymbols face in opposite directions they express the longing for wholeness, thatis, the desire not only to explore the two spheres but to conquer all space; to gotowards the left is to turn towards the unconscious and the past, to go to the rightis to face consciousness and the future. Jung points, as an example, to an illustra-tion in the Viatorium of Michael Maier (Rouen, 1651), showing two eagles flyingin opposite directions (32).Concerning graphic compositions proper, and their corresponding symbolicsignificance, we must not overlook the existence of the theory that they were"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"GRAPHICS129originally ornamental, a thesis which is upheld by Baltrusaitis among others. Heinsists upon the a priori thesis that artists are faced with a certain area to fill upand the need to achieve certain artistic effects, proceeding from concepts of order,symmetry, logic and clarity. But man’s aesthetic urges arose long after his need toexpress cosmic significances; and the contemporary concept of art as a sign andtestimony of a state of mind, rather than as the creation of beauty or of aestheticpleasure (which would seem automatically to preclude many modern works ofart lacking in positive or loveable qualities), appears to favour the view that theprimary impulse is to express a symbolic meaning. According to tradition, sym-metrical forms in art spring from the same source (the Gemini) as the bilateralsymmetry of the human figure, a symmetry which is echoed in the duplication ofcertain organs; such symmetrical forms include, for instance, the distribution offigures on a Romanesque or Gothic tympanum, or the arrangement of the sup-porters, the shield and helmet on an escutcheon. But if this idea of a commonorigin seems unacceptable, then the artistic preference for symmetry may beconceived as a simple anatomic projection, granted that the conviction of primor-dial rightness can only be experienced when the artificial is felt to be parallel,analogous or corresponding to the natural. A being with two arms at the sides ofa body surmounted by a head must tend to formulate primarily an order orpattern in which one principal shape is located in the middle and two secondaryshapes are placed at the sides. These elementary notions were first appreciatednot—in all probability—in the Palaeolithic Age (an age about which our knowl-edge is scant, and when man was, in any case, living under constant pressure fromthe need to exert himself in utilitarian ways), but in the period of the dawning ofhistory, from the latter part of the Neolithic up to the Bronze Age, or, in otherwords, from 5000 to 3000 B.C. This was the period, then, when cultural factorsfirst appeared or when they reached a definitive stage of development. Ortiz isright to suggest that man not improbably, before arriving at a generic configurationof life, first created ideograms of the tangible realities of life, and specially ofthose entities, such as the wind, which have no concrete shape. Fire was seen asflame; water as a succession of waves; rain was likened to tears; lightning to thezigzag, and so on (41).We do not wish to suggest that all pictographs or ideographs, let alone signs,of primitive or astrobiological cultures owe their origins to such motives as these,or that they disclose a similar, morphological process of development. We musthere distinguish between: realistic, imitative images in the first place (properly,drawings or paintings); in the second place, diagrammatic, imitative images (whichseek after the inner ‘rhythmic’ meaning of a given figure, as well as its outer form);"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"GRAPHICS130and, in the third, pure, rhythmic images (such as signs for animals deriving fromtheir tracks). Schneider observes that, in intermediary cultures, animal-symbolsare not representations of physical shapes but rhythmic lines determined by theanimals’ movements. He adds that, in Malacca, the symbolism of a given animalmay be applied to one of the four Elements: so that, for example, the symbol forwater is derived from the rhythmic movements of the frog’s legs (which, in anycase, are comparable with the rhythm of the waves); similarly, ants, as well ascentipedes, are signified by the rhythm of their movements (50). This concept of‘rhythm’ opens up enormous possibilities when applied to the conception of thelight of the spirit. Every man has his own rhythm; and so has every culture. Styleor personality are in the last resort simply expressions of rhythm. GermainBazin, in his Histoire de l’art (Paris, 1953), suggests that abstract art is theattempt to externalize the essential rhythms of the human, individual and collec-tive soul (the process being closely related to that of endopathy as conceived byAristotle, Vischer, Kant, Lipps, etc.).Consequently, in order to decide upon the significance of any graphic figure,we must bear in mind the following factors: (a) its resemblance to figures ofcosmic beings; (b) its shape, whether open or closed, regular or irregular, geomet-ric or biomorphic; (c) the number of component elements making up the shape,together with the significance of this number; (d) the dominant ‘rhythms’ as theexpression of its elemental, dynamic potential and its movement; (e) the spatialarrangement, or the disposition of its different zones; (f) its proportions; (g) itscolours, if any. Factor (a)—its resemblance to other figures—is so wide in scopeand so obvious in its implications that comment would be superfluous, (b) Thesignificance of shape depends upon the relevant geometric symbolism, which wehave examined above, (c) The number of its components confers an added sym-bolism to the secondary—though at times very important—consideration of theshape (for example, the seven-pointed star derives its significance as much fromthe septenary symbolism as from the stellar shape), (d) Concerning the ‘rhythms’,we have already pointed out the connexion with the number of component ele-ments and with animal-movements (Greek frets, and the broken line fashionedafter the trapeze are usually said to correspond to earth-symbolism, the wavyline to air-symbolism, a succession of incomplete spirals—or waves—as well asthe broken line, to water-symbolism, although fire is also associated with waterbecause of the triangular shape of the tongue of flame), (e) Regarding the spatialarrangement: along the vertical axis, it is the symbolism of level which mattersmost (implying qualities of morality and energy), and on the horizontal axis, theleft side is, as we have said, retrospective (for it is the zone of ‘origin’, linked with"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"GRAPHICS131the unconscious and with darkness), and the right side looks to the outcome.Hence, the line running from the left downwards and then upwards towards theright does not indicate a fall but an ascent, the converse also being true. And forthis reason, the St. Andrew’s cross, with its two intersecting and opposing linesstanding for fall and ascent respeclively, is symbolic of the intermingling of the‘two worlds’, and is therefore comparable with the mystic mandorla. In thosefigures which feature a centre together with dual, bilateral symmetry, we havetwo symbolic tendencies: first, that in which the rhythmic movements tendinwards, denoting concentration and also aggression (as, for example, in the clas-sical symbol of the four winds blowing towards the centre); and secondly, that inwhich rhythms well up from the centre towards the four cardinal points, indicat-ing the defence of ‘wholeness’ (the cross of St. Ferdinand is related to this) andbearing a certain relationship with the tetramorphs and the ‘four archers’ ofmegalithic culture. Irradiating figures denote dispersion, growth and involution. Itmust also be borne in mind that lines, in addition to their morphological proper-ties, are also means of communication and of conjoining; this is why their signifi-cance must always be closely linked with the nature of the zones which theybring into contact. There are, it must be said, some theorists who carry the studyof graphics to extremes of prolixity and detail. Ely Star, for example, examines thevarious shapes suggested by an upright line crossing a horizontal, simply by theprocess of linking the upright with the active principle and the horizontal withthe passive. He comments that straight lines are always expressive of activity,compared with curves which denote passivity (54). To turn now to the way thefirst ideographic signs were associated with the constellations, it is very impor-tant to note that the modern view favours the theory that the constellations werethe source of the alphabet. Gattefossé, Fenn and others are quite explicit uponthis point. Zollinger shows how the Great Bear is the origin of the sign represent-ing a bond, a link or an item of knowledge, how the Gemini gave rise to the number8 and the letter H, how the eternal cyclic laws of the sun’s orbit or the polarrotation of the earth gave rise to the swastika, the division of the increate intodifferent forms inspired the Chinese Yang-Yin sign, the manifest world inspiredthe horizontal line, the ‘Centre’ the cross, and, finally, how the union of the threeprinciples as represented by the signs for the Sun, the Moon and the crossoriginated the graphic symbol known as the emblem of Hermes. He goes on tomention the family resemblance between forms of bilateral symmetry such as theYang-Yin sign, the labrys (the twin-bladed axe), the labarum and the cross (61).Bayley found that, among his collection of watermarks, were a large number ofgraphic signs with a precise meaning to them: three circles, or the clover-leaf and"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"GREAT MONARCH, THE132its derivatives stand for the trinitarian; the labyrinth shaped like a cross, denotesboth inscrutability and close ties; wheels indicate the sun as the motivating forcebehind change and cycles (4). Concerning the symbolism of crosses, of which thevarieties are numerous, we shall confine ourselves to indicating that they dependupon the shape of their arms and the ‘rhythmic direction’ which these armssuggest (as in centrifugal, centripetal, neutral or rotatory crosses) (47). The sym-bols for planets and many other marks which cannot be reduced to a simplegeometric figure or explained as a combination of simple component elements,but which disclose a certain complexity of pattern, may nevertheless be inter-preted with the help of the principles enumerated above. To give just one ex-ample: In alchemy, the sign for ‘antimony’, representing the intellectual ‘soul’alive with all its virtues and faculties, is a cross placed upon a circle; the sign for‘green’, denoting the vegetative ‘soul’ or the physiological world, is a cross in-scribed within a circle; the sign for Venus, corresponding to instinctive behaviouror the base urges, is a cross placed below a circle. In short, there is nothingarbitrary about graphic symbolism (59): everything obeys a system which devel-ops out of a single point and expands into more complex forms in which shape,rhythm, quantity, position, order and direction all help to explain and define thepattern.Great Monarch, The This is a term which is to be found in some Hermeticwritings. According to Piobb, it owes its origin to an incorrect reading of theGreek, mistaking ‘he who governs himself alone’ for ‘he who governs alone’ (48).Be that as it may, the symbolism of the king refers, in any case, to him whotriumphs over himself, that is, to the hero definitive and victorious (48).Great Mother, The The archetype of the Great Mother corresponds tocertain feminine deities such as Ishtar in Babylonia, Isis in Egypt, Astarte inPhoenicia, Kâli-Durga in India, Ge and Demeter in Greece (56). It is usuallyconsidered to be a symbol of the fertilized earth (51), though the sea also appearsin ancient cosmogonies with the same connotation (4). For Jung, the MagnaMater represents the objective truth of Nature, masquerading, or incarnate, in thefigure of a maternal woman, a sybil, a goddess or a priestess, but sometimestaking the form of a church, for instance, or a city or district. This archetypalimage he calls ‘mana personality’, corresponding to the ‘Ancient of Days’ wholikewise takes such forms as the magician, sorcerer or sage (30).Great Priest, The The fifth enigma of the Tarot pack.

Also depicted in this imageare two disciples, both kneeling, one dressed in red (for activity) and the other inblack (passivity). On the positive side, this enigma signifies the moral law, dutyand conscience (59).Great Priestess, The The second enigma of the Tarot, representing Isis asthe goddess of the night. She is seated, holding a half-opened book in her righthand and two keys in her left, one of which is golden (signifying the sun, theword, or reason) and the other silver (the moon or imagination). Her throne issituated between two columns—being two in number, they are an allegory denot-ing the feminine principle—which are in fact the columns called Jachin and Boazin the Temple of Solomon, joined together by the veil which covers the entranceto the sanctuary. The first (the solar) column is red and corresponds to fire and toactivity; the second (the lunar) is blue. The tiara which crowns the head of theGreat Priestess has a lunar crescent—a symbol of cyclic phases and of the worldof phenomena; this emphasizes the predominance of the passive, reflective andfeminine qualities of the figure. She is leaning against the sphinx of the greatcosmic questions, and the floor, being composed of alternate white and blacktiles, denotes that everything in existence is subject to the laws of chance and ofopposites. In the Besançon Tarot, this enigma takes the form of the figure ofJuno. On the positive side, the Great Priestess signifies reflection and intuition;on the negative, intolerance (59).Griffin A fabulous animal, the front half of which is like an eagle and the rearhalf like a lion, with a long, serpentine tail. The blending of these two superiorsolar animals points to the generally beneficent character of this being; it wasconsecrated by the Greeks to Apollo and Nemesis (8). The griffin, like certainkinds of dragon, is always to be found as the guardian of the roads to salvation,standing beside the Tree of Life or some such symbol. From the psychologicalpoint of view it symbolizes the relationship between psychic energy and cosmicforce (4). In mediaeval Christian art, from Mozarabic miniatures onwards, thegriffin is very common, being associated with signs which tend towards ambiva-lence, representing, for instance, both the Saviour and Antichrist (20).Grotesques A type of ornament serving a largely decorative purpose. Favouredby the Romans, it became very common from the 15th century onwards, espe-cially in the Plateresque style. Some of its characteristics owe their inspiration—like emblems—to Gnosticism which, as is well known, made wide use of thesymbolic image in order to spread its doctrines. Bayley has collected a largenumber of grotesques and similar decorative motifs, among which the followingfigures predominate: the phoenix, swan, sheep, winged horses, serpents, dragons,"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"GUARDIAN134gardens, diverse flowers, shrubs, sheaves, garlands, creepers, roses in jars, fruits,baskets of flowers and fruits, vines, pomegranates, trees (especially the evergreensort), crosses, lilies, caducei, bolts, masks, steps, trophies, rosettes, bows, shields,brackets, swords, lances, cups and chalices, nude children, twins, sowers, fertil-ity goddesses with multiple breasts, caryatids, damsels. All these items have theirplace in the world of symbolism as component parts of allegories, emblems,Romanesque and Gothic capitals, and so on. But the grotesque in itself, as a formand as a system, emphasizes the close bond between continuity and discontinu-ity—of ambivalence, that is to say, as expressed, for instance, in the myth of theGemini. Hence, the grotesque is a general symbol for the world of phenomena andof the coherent unfolding of existence (4).Guardian Just as the powers of the Earth must be defended, so, by analogy,must all mythic, religious and spiritual wealth or power be protected againsthostile forces or against possible intrusion by the unworthy. Hence the familiar-ity of the ‘keeper of the treasure’ in legends: almost invariably, this guardian is agriffin or dragon, or else a warrior endowed with superhuman powers. In temples,the idea of defence is implicit in the spatial organization and confirmed by thedisposition of the walls, the doors and towers. In the Far East, the guardians areusually fabulous monsters. In Western countries, the same function may be per-formed by the figures inscribed on doorways. From the psychological point ofview, guardians symbolize the forces gathered on the threshold of transitionbetween different stages of evolution and spiritual progress or regression. The‘guardian of the threshold’ must be overcome before Man can enter into themastery of a higher realm.Gum The term Gummi arabicum was one employed by the alchemists todenote the substance of transmutation, for they believed that, once spiritualized,it became endowed with analogous qualities of spiritual adhesion. It is a symbolfor the seminal substance (32).HHair (Body-Hair) Whereas hair on the head, because it grows on the top ofthe human body, symbolizes spiritual forces and can be equated, within thesymbolism of water, with the ‘Upper Ocean’, body-hair is equivalent to the"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"HALO135‘Lower Ocean’, that is to say, it denotes the proliferation of the irrational powerof the cosmos and of the instinctive life. This explains why the priests of manyreligions, the Egyptians among them, shaved off all their hair. And it also explainswhy the god Pan—a prefiguration of the devil—was depicted with hairy legs.Despite the above generalization, there are some traditions in which the hair ofthe head as well as on the body takes on a malign significance (8).Hairs In general, hairs represent energy, and are related to the symbolism oflevels. That is, a head of hair, being located on the head, stands for higher forces,whereas abundant body-hair signifies the prevalence of the baser forces. Some-times these two meanings have coalesced: on a Romanesque capital at Estibaliz,Adam is depicted beardless before the Fall and with long hair and bushy beardafter he has fallen into sin (46). Hairs also signify fertility. Origen used to say:‘The Nazirites do not cut their hair because all that is done by just men prospersand their leaves to not fall’ (46). In Hindu symbolism, hairs, like the threads of afabric, symbolize the ‘lines of force’ of the universe (25). A full head of hairrepresents élan vital and joie de vivre, linked with the will to succeed (42). Again,hairs correspond to the element of fire, signifying the burgeoning of primitiveforces (50). A highly important secondary meaning is derived from the colour ofhair. Brown or black hair reinforces the symbolism of hair in general, that is, dark,terrestrial energy; golden hair is related to the sun’s rays (31, 38) and to the wholevast sun-symbolism; copper-coloured hair implies a Venusian or demoniacal char-acteristic (32). Hairs, then, come to symbolize the concept of spiritualized en-ergy. Phaldor, in his Libro d’oro del sogno, comments that they ‘represent thespiritual assets of Man. Abundant, beautiful hair, for both man and woman,signifies spiritual development. To lose one’s hair signifies failure and poverty’(56). Now, the reverse of loss brought about by forces outside Man’s control is,in part, willing sacrifice. For this reason, Zimmer points out that all who renounceand defy the principles of procreation and multiplication of life, in order toembark upon the path of total asceticism, are bound on principle to cut their hairshort. They must simulate the sterility of the aged and hairless who form the lastlink in the chain of generations. Some religions, as for example that of the ancientEgyptians, used to prescribe total depilation (60). Hair, wigs and beards wereused by the Sumerians to ward off evil spirits (as was smoke).Halo The aureole, nimbus or halo is a luminous circle like a crown with whichthe ancients invested their deities and which Christians accord to the holy (8). Itis a visual expression of irradiating, supernatural force, or, sometimes, moresimply, of intellectual energy in its mystic aspect; the fact that the Ancientsalmost invariably equated intelligence with light is proof enough of this. Other"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"HAMLET136kinds of halos are spherical in form: the Moslems, for example, often made use ofthe pearl to represent paradise and their belief was that the blessed, each oneunited with his houri, live in pearls. The halo is equated with the cage and, inparticular, with the sphere itself (46). Jurgis Baltrusaitis, in Le Moyen Agefantastique, has collected a host of mediaeval drawings and paintings of beingsenclosed in transparent spheres apparently made of glass. Many of the works ofHieronymus van Aecken (Bosch) contain examples of this. The halo, in this case,is a simple visual expression of a kind of determinism enveloping each man withinhis mode of being and his destiny, whether it is favourable and paradisiac, oradverse and infernal.Hamlet Although literary myths do not normally enter into the scope of thiswork, we have decided to make an exception in the case of Hamlet, Prince ofDenmark. This famous Shakespearian tragedy has its origins in a Nordic legend.Apart from the Renaissance dramatist’s explanation of its ‘obvious contents’, italso lends itself to other explanations of latent contents, or, better, to disclosureson other planes. One of these interpretations, the psychoanalytic, would tendtowards the belief that Hamlet really becomes mad, and that the assassination ofhis father by his uncle is mere fiction, an invention of his mind intended to helphim to accept more easily the Oedipus complex which is so powerful in him. Hissatisfaction on killing Polonius, which foreshadows the moment when he kills hisstep-father, seems to bear out this explanation. So do his rejection of Ophelia(which may be interpreted in a different way), and his complete forgiveness of hismother, who in Electra (a Greek tragedy along similar lines) is implacably assas-sinated by her avenging offspring. A second explanation of Hamlet, which is moreprofound and symbolic, results from applying Gnostic doctrine to his story.Hamlet hates the world and considers it to be the work of the evil god, of thedemiurge (the husband of his mother, who is the material and whom he pardonsbecause he judges her to be the merely passive agent of Evil). He dreams of thegood god, of the Father, who seems rather to be his own projection, his auto-divination in a transcendent situation. The rejection of the world has a ‘necrophiliac’explanation in the scene in the graveyard with Yorick’s skull and an absolutemanifestion in his spurning of Ophelia (woman = guilt). There is an angelism inHamlet which causes us to consider him to be the symbol and archetype ofOedipal man, who suffers from being tied to the world, from being a materialentity and from owning his existence to a being whom he would kill and by whomhe might possibly be killed (cf. the slaying of the first-born by the primitivefather, according to Freud). As a case of anguish and repressions leading to a seriesof crimes which can only be resolved by his own self-destruction, Hamlet is a"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"HAND137symbol of man in rebellion against the ‘filial’ situation, a humanized (and Chris-tianized?) symbol, successor to Aeschylus’ ‘Prometheus’ and predecessor toMilton’s ‘Satan’. I owe these ideas to seeing the cinematographic Hamlet, di-rected and interpreted by Sir Laurence Olivier, whose intensity suggested to meall that I express here in the form of a hypothesis.Hammer An instrument proper to the smith, endowed with the mysticpower of creation (51). The two-headed hammer is, like the twin-bladed axe, anambivalent symbol of the mountain of Mars and of sacrificial Inversion.Hand In the Egyptian tongue, the term designating the hand was related tothat for the pillar (or a support, or strength) and for the palm (4). In esotericdoctrine, the position of the hand in relation to the body, and the arrangement ofthe fingers, convey certain precise symbolic notions (48). According to the Egyp-tian system of hieroglyphs, the hand signifies manifestation, action, donating andhusbandry. An eye in association with a hand—as for example in some orientalmythic beings—symbolize ‘clairvoyant action’ (19). Schneider concedes a majorrôle to the hand ‘because it is the corporeal manifestation of the inner state of thehuman being’ and because ‘it expresses an attitude of mind in terms other than theacoustic’—or, in other words, a gesture. It follows, then, that the raised hand isthe symbol of the voice and of song; the hand placed on the breast indicates theattitude of the sage; placed on the neck it denotes sacrifice; two hands joinedsignifies mystic marriage—the Jungian individuation; the hand covering the eyesrepresents clairvoyance at the moment of death (50). Of great importance is thefact that the hand has five fingers, firstly, because of its broad analogy with thehuman figure (composed of four extremities plus the head), and, secondly, byreason of the symbolism of the number five (denoting love, health and humanity)(40). In Egyptian hieroglyphics, the open hand signifies any specificially humantask as well as magnetic force (19)—an idea also characteristic of pre-ColumbianAmerica. And a very similar belief lies behind the widespread use of the hand asan amulet in Islamic cultures. According to Berber thought, the hand signifiesprotection, authority, power and strength; the manus had the same meaning forthe Romans, symbolizing in particular the authority of the pater familias and ofthe emperor, and is sometimes to be seen surmounting the signum of the legionsin place of the imperial eagle. In the Islamic amulets mentioned above, the figureof the hand undergoes various modifications or appears in association with othersymbols, as, for instance, the star, the dove, the bird, the fan, the zigzag and thecircle, forming emblems comparable with those of the Christian West (12). Thefamiliar emblem of the ‘linked hands’ is expressive of a virile fraternity, or solidar-ity in the face of danger (49). In Jung’s opinion, the hand is endowed with a"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"HANGED MAN138generative significance (31). The difference between the right hand and the left isusually ignored, but when the distinction is made it appears merely to serve thepurpose of enriching the basic significance with the additional implications ofspace-symbolism, the right side corresponding to the rational, the conscious, thelogical and the virile; the left side representing the converse (33). There are al-chemic images which represent a King clasping in his own left hand the left handof the Queen. Jung suggests that this may refer to the unconscious character oftheir union but that it may also be indicative either of affection or of suspicion(33).Hanged Man This figure has a profound and complex symbolism. It isenigma number twelve of the Tarot pack of cards, but its fundamental significancehas wider implications. Frazer noted that primitive man endeavours to keep hisdeities alive by isolating them between heaven and earth, thereby placing them ina position which is immune to ordinary influences (21), especially terrestrialones. This and every other kind of suspension in space implies, then, a mysticalisolation which is doubtless related to the idea of levitation and to dream-flight.On the other hand, the inverted position is in itself a symbol of purification(because it inverts, analogically, the natural, terrestrial order) (50). Both the leg-end of the Hanged Man as a figure endowed with magic powers, and the Odinmyth, belong to this symbolic system. Of Odin it was said that he had sacrificedhimself by hanging. The relevant verses of Havamal read: ‘I know that I havebeen hanging from the stormy tree for nine consecutive nights, wounded by thespear, as an offering to Odin: myself offered to myself.’ Similar sacrifices are partof normal cult-practice in many parts of the world (21). Jung explains this sym-bolism in purely psychological terms, saying that ‘hanging . . . has an unmistak-able symbolic value, since swinging (hanging and suffering as one swings) is thesymbol of unfulfilled longing or tense expectation’ (31). The Tarot card men-tioned above depicts a figure like the Minstrel hanging by one foot from a ropetied to a crossbar supported by two leafless trees. The interpretation is that theHanged Man does not live the ordinary life of this earth, but, instead, lives in adream of mystical idealism. The strange gallows from which he hangs is yellow incolour to indicate it consists of concentrated light, i.e. concentrated thought. Thusit is said that the Hanged Man hangs from his own doctrine, to which he isattached to such an extent that his entire being hangs upon it. The two treesbetween which he hangs are related—like anything that is connected with thenumerical symbolism of 2—to the Boaz and Jachin pillars of the Cabala. They arecoloured green tending to blue (natural or terrestrial nature tending towards heaven)."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"HARP139The Hanged Man’s clothing is red and white, these being the mystical colours ofthe two-headed eagle of the alchemists. His arms are tied together, and hold half-opened bags out of which gold coins are tumbling, this being an allegory of thespiritual treasures to be found in the being who performs this self-sacrifice.According to Wirth, the mythological hero closest to this symbolic character isPerseus, the personification of thought in action, who—in his flight—overcamethe forces of evil in order to free Andromeda, who symbolizes the soul chained tothe dull rock of matter, rising from the waves of the primeval ocean. In thepositive sense, number twelve of the Tarot pack stands for mysticism, sacrifice,self-denial, continence. In the negative sense it denotes a Utopian dream-world(59).Hare In the Egyptian series of hieroglyphs, the hare is a determinative signdefining the concept of being, and symbolic in consequence of elemental existence(19). Among the Algonquin Indians, the Great Hare is the animal-demiurge. Themyth was also known to the Egyptians. In Greece, the lunar goddess, Hecate,was associated with hares. The German equivalent of Hecate, the goddess Harek,was accompanied by hares (35). In general, the hare is a symbol of procreation; itis ambivalent in that it may be considered as naturally amoral or moral. TheHebrews regarded it as an ‘unclean’ animal (Deuteronomy xiv, 7). For RabanusMaurus, it symbolized lasciviousness and fecundity. However, it had also be-come, by Gothic times, an allegorical figure of fleetness and of diligent service, forit is to be found on many Gothic sepulchres as an emblem in this particularsense—a sense subsidiary to that outlined above (46). A feminine character isinseparable from the fundamental symbolization of the hare; hence it is notsurprising to find that it was the second of the twelve emblems of the Emperor ofChina, symbolic of the Yin force in the life of the monarch (5). The Chineseconceived the hare as an animal of augury and it was said to live on the moon.Harp Equated with the white horse (4) and the mystic ladder. It acts as abridge between heaven and earth. This is why, in the Edda, heroes express theirdesire to have a harp buried with them in their grave, so as to facilitate their accessto the other world. There is also a close connexion between the harp and the swan(50). It might also be regarded as a symbol of the tension inherent in the stringswith its striving towards love and the supernatural world, a situation of stresswhich crucifies man in every moment of the anguished expectation of his earthlylife. This would explain the detail of Bosch’s Garden of Delights, where a humanfigure hangs crucified on the strings of a harp. Music being a symbol of puremanifestation of the Will (Schopenhauer), the harp would seem to be a particu-"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"HARPIES140larly intense and characteristic embodiment of sound as the carrier of stress andsuffering, of form and life-forces (Plate XIV).Harpies Fabulous beings, daughters of Neptune and the sea, usually regardedas allegories or personifications of vice in its twin aspects of guilt and punishment(8). At a deeper level, they have been defined as a representation of the ‘evilharmonies of cosmic energies’ (48). Sometimes the emphasis is entirely on theirdynamic nature, in which case they are depicted in the well-known attitude of‘swift movement’, reminiscent of the swastika. This is also the case with theErinyes and the Gorgons (41). In mediaeval decorative art they sometimes occurmerely as emblems of the sign of Virgo in its musical aspects. In heraldry, thefigure of the harpy has no sinister associations (48).Harpist The symbolism of the harpist follows from that of his instrument.He frequently occurs in literature, one of the most famous examples being inGoethe’s Wilhelm Meister. In a German poem—Die Krone—Guinevere arousesher husband’s jealousy by telling him of a knight who rides past every night,singing. . . . Celtic folklore tells how Yseult was abducted by a harp-player. Thetale of the Pied Piper describes how the children follow him as he plays a tune onhis pipe. All these figures are personifications of the fascination of death, that is,Freud’s death-wish. Also, in Greek mythology the psychopomp Hermes is theinventor of the lyre and the flute (35).Hat According to Jung, the hat, since it covers the head, generally takes on thesignificance of what goes on inside it: thought. He recalls the German saying ‘toput all ideas under one hat’, and mentions that in Meyrink’s novel The Golem, theprotagonist thinks the thoughts and undergoes the experiences of another manwhose hat he has put on by mistake (32). Jung also points out that, since the hatis the ‘crown’ and summit of an individual, it may therefore be said to cover him,an idea which carries a special symbolic significance. By its shape, the hat may beinvested with specific significance; for example, that of the Minstrel in the Tarotpack (56). To change one’s hat is equivalent to a change of mind or of ideas. Thechoice of a hat—associated with a particular social order—denotes the desire tobe admitted to that set or to partake of its inherent characteristics. There are hats,like the Phrygian cap, that have a special phallic significance, and others that canconfer invisibility (symbolic of repression).Hawk An emblem of the soul in ancient Egypt, with the implication of solartransfiguration (57). Nevertheless, Pinedo maintains that it may have been amediaeval allegory of the evil mind of the sinner. In the cloister at Silos there is anillustration of hawks tearing hares to pieces, and it appears to carry this signifi-cance (46), although, given the negative significance of the hare (it symbolizes"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"H E A D-DRESS AND THRONE141fecundity, but also lasciviousness), the hawk might be taken as a symbol ofvictory over concupiscence (since it destroyed the lascivious hares). But thiskind of struggle is better represented by the mythic and legendary motif—alsofrequent in folklore—of the griffin composed of various parts all struggling oneagainst the other, so that it appears at once as executioner and victim.Head In the Zohar, the ‘magic head’ stands for astral light (9); in mediaeval artit is a symbol for the mind (46) and for the spiritual life, which explains thefrequency with which it appeared in decorative art. On the other hand, Plato inTimaeus asserts that ‘the human head is the image of the world’. In corroborationof this, Leblant points out that the skull, the semi-spherical crown of the humanbody, signifies the heavens. Clearly, the head-symbol here coalesces with that ofthe sphere as a symbol of Oneness. It had the same significance in Egyptianhieroglyphics (19). The eagle’s head has been used as a solar symbol and anemblem of the centre-point of emanation—that is, of the cosmic flame and thespiritual fire of the universe (4). Two, three or four heads shown in juxtapositionsymbolize a corresponding intensification of a given aspect of head-symbolism.Thus, the Gemini, a symbol of the duality of Nature, or of the integrating (but notunifying) link between the two principles of creation, are represented by beingswith two heads or two faces, like the Roman Janus for example. Hecate is de-picted with three heads—she is called triform for this reason—a symbolismwhich may be related to the ‘three levels’ of heaven, earth and hell, as well as toDiel’s three ‘urges of life’ (15). The juxtaposition of four heads or faces, as in theimage of Brahma the Supreme Lord, stems from the same symbolism as that ofthe tetramorph (60). A factor of major importance bearing upon the symbolism ofthe head is mentioned by Herbert Kühn, in his L’Ascension de l’humanité (Paris,1958). He makes the point that the decapitation of corpses in prehistoric timesmarked Man’s discovery of the independence of the spiritual principle, residingin the head, as opposed to the vital principle represented by the body as a whole.Kühn adds that Neolithic thought was very close to the mediaeval in its convic-tion that an eternal and invisible essence underlies all appearances (Plate XV).Head-dress and Throne In ancient, oriental cultures, and especially inMesopotamia and India, there is always a formal and significant relationshipbetween all the objects and edifices related to any one particular cult. For ex-ample, as Eliade notes, there is an inner and outer analogy between head-dress,thrones and palaces in Babylonian traditions: all three refer to the ‘Centre’ (17).And Luc Benoist has observed of Hindu cults that the altar, the temple, thethrone, the palace, the city, the kingdom and the world are all by implicationimages of the ‘Centre’, their direct model being mount Meru (the centre of the"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"HEART142world). The processional carriage is a temple-on-wheels (6), with all the ‘corre-spondences’ implied.Heart In the vertical scheme of the human body, the focal points are three innumber: the brain, the heart and the sexual organs. But the central point is theheart, and in consequence it comes to partake of the meanings of the other two.The heart was the only part of the viscera left by the Egyptians in the mummy,since it was regarded as the centre indispensable to the body in eternity; for allcentres are symbols of eternity, since time is the motion of the periphery of thewheel of phenomena rotating around the Aristotelian ‘unmoved mover’. In tradi-tional ways of thought, the heart was taken as the true seat of intelligence, thebrain being merely instrumental (25); hence, in ancient attempts to explain theprofound and continuing analogies between concepts, the moon was said tocorrespond to the brain and the sun to the heart. All representations of the‘Centre’ have been related in some way to the heart, either through correspon-dences or through substitution, as in the case of the goblet, the coffer and thecavern. For the alchemists, the heart was the image of the sun within man, just asgold was the image of the sun on earth (32). The importance of love in the mysticdoctrine of unity explains how it is that love-symbolism came to be closely linkedwith heart-symbolism, for to love is only to experience a force which urges thelover towards a given centre. In emblems, then, the heart signifies love as thecentre of illumination and happiness, and this is why it is surmounted by flames,or a cross, or a fleur-de-lis, or a crown (4).Hearth A form of ‘domestic sun’, a symbol of the home, of the conjunctionof the masculine principle (fire) with the feminine (the receptacle) and, conse-quently, of love (49).Heat For Jung, heat is an image of the libido (31). Any representation—oreven the mere mention—of heat always bears a symbolic relation to maturation,whether biological or spiritual (32). In emblems of the sun, it is portrayed aswavy lines alternating with the straight lines representing light. We should alsobear in mind all the correspondences which exist between heat and tones, sounds,colours, the seasons, etc.Heaven Here is Luc Benoist’s version of a passage about heaven taken fromthe Chândogya Upanishad: ‘In the beginning, all the universe was non-being. Itbecame being. It grew and formed an egg, which remained unbroken for a year.Then it broke open. Of the two halves of the shell, one was of silver and the otherof gold.’ The latter was heaven, while the former became earth. In Hindu architec-ture, these two halves are represented by the altar and the stupa (6). One canclearly see in all this how the myth arose from converging formal analogies.Heaven has always been considered, except in Egypt, as part of the masculine or"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"HELMET143active principle, associated with things of the spirit and with the number three,whereas the earth is related to the feminine, passive or material principle, and thenumber four. Mircea Eliade has something to say about the symbolism of heavenwhich is rather less abstract and therefore fails to be so cosmogonic: the azure ofthe sky, he suggests, is the veil which hides the divine face. The clouds are hisgarments. The light of heaven is the ointment with which he anoints his immensebody. The stars are his eyes (17). Again: among oriental peoples, the dome ofheaven is associated with the nomad’s tent—quite apart from the usual heaven/earth association—as if they had a presentiment that three-dimensional space isonly a kind of lid which prevents Man from penetrating into the mystery of theother world. Celestial space, then, ceases to be a container and becomes contentof hyperspace, or rather, of trans-space. A terrible aspect of heaven can be seen inthe myth of the cosmic catastrophe which William Blake appears to have had inmind when he wrote of ‘the angry religion of the stars’ (3). We must also remem-ber that, from the earliest times, heaven has been thought of as consisting ofseveral heavens, owing to the tendency of primitive logic to assign a separate,cellular space to each celestial body or group of bodies, a tendency which antici-pates the theory of gravitation, the gravitational field and the laws of organicstructures, and which illuminates the very essence of the relationship betweenthe qualitative (the discontinuous) and the quantitative (the continuous) (PlateXVI).Hecate A symbol of the Terrible Mother, appearing as the tutelar deity ofMedea or as a lamia who devours men. She is a personification of the moon, or ofthe evil side of the feminine principle, responsible for madness, obsession andlunacy. Her attributes are the key, the lash, the dagger and the torch (31).He-Goat The he-goat is a kind of scape-goat—a symbol of the projection ofone’s own guilt upon someone else, and of the consequent repression of one’sconscience. Hence the traditional significance of the he-goat as an emissary, andits evil association with the devil (15). It is also, like the bull, a father-symbol(50).Helios Helios signifies the sun in its astronomic aspect, just as Apollosymbolizes it in its spiritual aspect. In ancient cults, he appears as a god whopresides over the seasons, vegetation, fecundity and the fruitfulness of the earth(15).Helmet In heraldic symbolism, it is an emblem of lofty thoughts, or ofhidden thoughts if the vizor is lowered. This latter aspect corresponds to thegeneral symbolism of invisibility, which is thus equated with the hood and the hat(38), although this seems to be a clear case of undue emphasis upon one meaningat the expense of all the others. The inevitable and intimate association of the"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"HEMISPHERES144helmet with the head has an important bearing upon the relation between twosymbols: thus, a helmet with a strange crest may be a symbol of highly imagina-tive or restless exhilaration. The hat, the hood and the mantilla have the sameintimate, symbolic association with the head: their colour usually denotes thewearer’s prevailing shade of thought.Hemispheres In Egyptian hieroglyphics, the semicircle with the diameter asthe base is a sign representing the sun’s orbit and also the hemisphere. It symbol-izes the Origin counterbalanced by the End—or birth counterbalanced by death.Grammatically, this hieroglyph expresses the feminine principle balancing themasculine (19).Herald at Arms Like Egyptian and Chaldean scribes, heralds at arms arerepositories of hermetic wisdom and, therefore, ‘keepers of secrets’, according toAlleau in De la Nature des symboles (Paris, 1958). Heralds at arms are related toshield-bearers and to the standard-bearers of ancient armies (e.g. the Romanaquilifer, or eagle-bearer).Heraldic Symbols The outward components of heraldry (crowns, helmets,mantles, lambrequins, supporters, chains), like the inner elements (or arms: colours,metals, furs, parties, noble quarterings, figures), apart from their literal or anec-dotal senses, have a symbolic significance, according to Cadet de Gassicourt andthe Baron du Roure de Paulin, in L’Hermétisme et l’art héraldique (Paris, 1907).(Piobb supports their opinion in his review of the book in L’Année occultiste etpsychique, 1907.) Metals and colours may be ‘read’ in terms of their own particu-lar symbolism; parties and noble quarterings by spatial and graphic symbolism,as well as by their implicit ‘correspondences’. Heraldic art recognizes five coloursor enamels and two metals: gold (the Sun), silver (the Moon), gules (red—Mars),sinople (green—Venus), azure (Jupiter), purple (Mercury) and sable (Saturn).The symbolic meanings of colours, metals and parties are considered as productsof the active (or spiritual) principle of the shield-of-arms working upon thepassive, quaternary material symbolized by the surface of the shield. City coats-of-arms may be explained along similar lines, according to Gérard de Sède who, inLes Templiers sont parmi nous (Paris, 1962), suggests that the ship in the shieldof the City of Paris may derive from the myth of the Argonauts, the quest for theGolden Fleece and the alchemical Work.Herbs Herbs sometimes have the symbolic significance of human beings.This is suggested by the etymology of the Greek neophytos (‘new herb’) (17).They are also related to the idea of natural forces, both of good and evil. Becausethey can be both medicinal and poisonous, herbs are very commonly featured in"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"HERMAPHRODITE145legends and folktales, as well as in magic. The business of cataloguing the differentcharacteristics of each herb or plant is clearly a matter for specialized study.Hercules As a hero, Hercules became a symbol of the individual freeinghimself in the quest for immortality, expiating his sins and errors through suffer-ing and ‘heroic striving’. In this way he was able, for his own sake and for that ofhis brother (whose existence relates Hercules to the Gemini-myth), to conquer,exterminate or master all monsters (symbolic of plagues, vices and the forces ofevil) within the ordered and gradual process of the evolutionary struggle (15). Hisattributes are the club (a symbol of overwhelming force, of annihilation—notmerely of victory) and the Nemean lion’s skin (a solar symbol) (8). Hercules wasunable to undertake a new task until after he had brought his previous trial to asuccessful conclusion. Hence alchemists, from Antiquity to the Middle Ages,would interpret the myth of Hercules-the-hero as a configuration of the spiritualstruggle which leads to the ‘conquest of the golden apples in the Garden of theHesperides’—or immortality. Piobb has linked the twelve trials of Hercules withthe signs of the Zodiac—thus confirming his character as a solar hero recognizedby mythologists—as follows: his victory over the giants such as Geryon andCacus with Aries; the Cretan bull with Taurus; the pillars with the Gemini; thehydra of Lerna and the birds of lake Stymphalus with Cancer; the lion of Nemeawith Leo; the Amazons with Virgo; the walls of Troy and the Augean stables withLibra; the boar of Erymanthus with Scorpio; the centaurs and the mares ofDiomedes with Sagittarius; the stag of the golden horns with Capricorn; the eagleand Prometheus with Aquarius; and the monster which attacked Hesione withPisces (48).Hermaphrodite Hermaphrodite deities, connected with the myth of birth(19), are found on many Egyptian monuments: for example, the pedestal of oneof the colossi at Memnon. The hermaphrodite is a consequence of applying thesymbolism of the number two to the human being, creating a personality which isintegrated despite its duality. In India, this dual being—two sexes united in asingle personality—was the primal force, the light from which life emanates (49),that is to say, the lingam (60). The myth of the hermaphrodite was also known inpre-Columbian Mexico, in the figure of Quetzalcoatl, the god in whom the laws ofopposites and of the separate sexes are finally united. The hermaphrodite is,above all, a god of procreation (41), closely linked, and ultimately identified, withthe Gemini archetype. Plato, in the Symposium, states that the Gods first createdMan in the form of a sphere incorporating two bodies and both sexes.

In other words, it expresses in sexual—and hence very obvious—terms theessential idea that all pairs of opposites are integrated into Oneness. For Eliade,hermaphroditism is, therefore, simply an archaic form of divine bi-unity. Magic-religious thinking first stated this concept in biological terms, before clothing it inmetaphysical (esse non esse) or theological language (the revealed or non-revealedworld). The androgynous divinity was also known in China and in many othercountries (Persia, Palestine, Australia, etc.) (17). In the androgynous myth wesee, however, not only an expression of the cause but also of the controllingspiritual energy. This is very clearly brought out by Ely Star when he says that nohappiness, unless it be one of the exceptions mentioned by St. Paul, can provesatisfying until it is made whole by marriage (which is an imperfect image ofhermaphroditism), since the spirit always manifests itself as a segregated form inthe world of existence, and this is a source of suffering and restlessness (54).Thus, the Hermaphrodite is not only linked to the remote Platonic past, but alsoprojected into the future. In addition, it is clearly a symbol of an intellectualactivity which is not in itself connected with the problem of the sexes. Blavatskysays that all peoples regarded their first god as androgynous, because Primitivehumanity knew that he had sprung from ‘the mind’, as is shown by many tradi-tions such as that of Minerva springing from the head of Jupiter (9). In alchemy,the Hermaphrodite plays an important rôle as Mercury; he is depicted as a two-headed figure, often accompanied by the word Rebis (double thing).Hermit, The The ninth enigma of the Tarot pack. It is an allegory of an oldman carrying in his right hand a lantern partially covered by one of the folds of hiscloak, which is dark outside (signifying withdrawal and austerity) but with a bluelining (representing aerial nature). If he finds the serpent of the instincts in hispath, he does not destroy it but simply charms it into twining itself round hisstaff, as Aesculapius did. He is a master of the invisible. On the positive side, thehermit signifies tradition, study, reserve, patient and profound work. On thenegative, he stands for all that is taciturn, tedious and meticulous (59).Hero, The The cult of the hero has been found necessary not only becauseof the exigencies of war, but because of the virtues inherent in heroism—virtueswhich have surely been apparent to Man from prehistoric times and which he hasfelt the need to exalt, emphasize and record. The magic, the apparatus and thesplendour of the very appurtenances of the ancient warrior proclaim the truth ofthis, as does the custom of according an acclamation worthy of kings to theconquering hero. The relationship between the ‘little holy war’, that is the struggle"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"HERON148with the material enemies outside, and the ‘Great Holy War’, or combat with thespiritual enemies inside the personality, inevitably gave rise to the same relation-ship being drawn between the hero of the ‘little war’ and the champion of the‘Great War’. Every heroic characteristic finds its analogy among the virtues nec-essary to vanquish chaos and overcome the temptations offered by the forces ofdarkness. This explains why, in many myths, the sun was identified with the heropar excellence. Hence, Alexander the Great is pictured on coins with the horns ofJupiter Ammon, that is, he is identified with the awakening sun of Spring underthe sign of Aries. And this leads Jung to state that the most widely accepted of allthe symbols of the libido—and he could equally well have said ‘the spirit’—is thehuman figure as the hero—the subject of so many myths, legends and traditionaltales. He adds that in the life destined for the hero, the historical and the symbolicare one and the same thing. The first object of the hero is to conquer himself; andthis is the reason why the heroes of Germanic legends are usually portrayed withthe eyes of a snake. The mythic hero, Cecrops, is half-man and half-serpent (31).A hero turned Christian is a hero turned knight, with the aid of the saintlywarriors such as St. George and St. Michael (Plate XVII).Heron Among the Egyptians, a symbol of the morning and of the generationof life. Together with the ibis and the stork, it carried a favourable significance (4).Hesperides, The They are the daughters of Atlas and Hesperis. They livedin a garden with trees bearing golden apples, watched over by a dragon. Herculestook possession of these apples, following upon his victory over the guardiandragon. Vossius explained this myth by an astronomical analogy, whereby theHesperides become eventide, the garden becomes the firmament, the golden applesthe stars, the dragon the Zodiac and Hercules the sun (8). But this interpretationdoes not invalidate the psychology implicit in all the other symbols connectedwith this myth, in particular that of the hero and the treasure acquired only aftergreat exertions.Hieroglyphics Under this heading are grouped representative ideographs,i.e. comprising schematic images of objects, to which may be added others, moresimple or more abstract. In itself, the basic concept of hieroglyphics is similar tothat of the enigma. By antonomasia, hieroglyphics are confined to those of theEgyptian civilization (which recognized three forms of writing: hieroglyphic,hieratic and demotic). The hieroglyphic system attained a total of 900 signs(representative of ideas, syllables, words and letters, or their complements =determinatives). Because of its complexity, it was mastered only by the priestlycaste, and, by Roman times, people were already beginning to forget how to"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"HOLE149decipher it. Horapollo Niliacus attempted to restore it in the 2nd and 3rd centu-ries of our era, taking symbolism as his basis. The subject was forgotten forcenturies, until Father Athanasius Kircher revived it during the 17th century.Anybody interested in this subject should consult the work by Madeleine V.-David, Le Débat sur les écritures et l’hiéroglyphe aux XVIIe. et XVIIIe. siècles(Paris, 1965), which is a modern, symbolic, profound interpretation, based onthat of Enel in La langue sacrée.Hippalectryon A fabulous animal, half-horse and half-cock, and probably asun-symbol.Hippogryph A fabulous animal, half-horse and half-griffin, which Ariostoand other authors of books of chivalry gave to their heroes for a steed. It is a kindof supercharged Pegasus, a blend of the favourable aspects of the griffin and thewinged horse in its character as the ‘spiritual mount’ (8).Hippopotamus In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, it represents strengthand vigour. It is also related to the ideas of fertility and water, and, consequently,to the mother-principle (19).Hog A symbol of impure desires, of the transmutation of the higher into thelower and of the amoral plunge into corruption (15).Hole A very important symbol, with two main aspects: on the biologicallevel, it has fertilizing power and is related to fertility rites; on the spiritual plane,it stands for the ‘opening’ of this world on to the other world. Worship of‘perforated stones’ in one form or another is very common all over the world.Eliade notes that, in the region of Amance, there is just such a stone in front ofwhich women kneel to pray for the health of their children. To this day, inPaphos, barren women crawl through the hole of such a stone. Primitive Indianpeoples were mainly concerned with its symbolism at the physical level, identi-fying the hole with the female sexual organs, although they too had an intuitiveawareness of the fact that holes could stand for the ‘gateway of the world’, whichthe soul has to cross in order to be released from the cycle of karma (17). In theBrihadaranyaka Upanishad it is said that ‘when a human being leaves this world,he makes his way through the air, and the air opens up for him as wide as acartwheel’ (50). The artistic expression of this symbol is found in the Chinese Pi,i.e. the representation of heaven. It is a jade disc with a hole in the middle;measurements vary from case to case, but according to the Chinese dictionaryErh Ya, the relation between the outside ring and the central hole remains con-stant. This hole is the Hindu ‘gateway’, also the Aristotelian ‘unvarying mean’ or‘unmoved mover’. The origins of the Pi are exceedingly remote, and carved anddecorated Pi have also been found (39). As a symbol of heaven, the hole also"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"HOLLOW150stands specifically for the passage from spatial to non-spatial, from temporal tonon-temporal existence, and corresponds to the zenith (52). The strange androughly hewn door-openings of some neolithic stone-structures have been inter-preted by some scholars as symbolic holes in the above sense; the laboriousnature of these holes could otherwise have been avoided by means of the simpleand well-known pillar-and-lintel method of construction. An outstanding ex-ample of this kind of door is that at Hagiar Kim (Malta). It is interesting to note,in this connexion, that the initiation ceremony among the Pomo Indians of North-ern California includes a ritual blow from a grizzly bear paw, which is supposedto make a hole in the neophyte’s back, on account of which he ‘dies’ and is rebornto a new stage of life. It is probable that, from the earliest times, the visual aspectof wounds helped to strengthen the association between the concept of the holeand that of passing into the other life. All this seems to be corroborated by the factthat in many symbolist pictures, e.g. in Gustave Moreau’s Orpheus, the back-ground landscape includes perforated rocks which are evidently invested with atranscendental significance. It is also worth recalling Salvador Dali’s frequentpractice, amounting almost to an obsession, of painting holes (regular in shape,like windows) on the backs of some of his figures.Hollow A hollow is the abstract aspect of the cavern, and the inverse of themountain. There are many symbolic significances superimposed upon the basicsense of the hollow, such as that of the Abode of the Dead, of Memories and ofthe Past, with further allusions to the mother and also to the unconscious (15), asthe link between all these different aspects.Honey In Orphic tradition, honey is a symbol of wisdom. The occult maxim‘the bees are born from the oxen’ finds its explanation in the astrological relation-ship between Taurus and Cancer (40) and in the symbolic use of the ox as a signfor sacrifice, expressive of the idea that there is no higher knowledge withoutsuffering. Honey was also credited with other meanings: rebirth or change ofpersonality consequent upon initiation; and, in India, the superior self (compa-rable with fire). Given that honey is the product of a mysterious and elaborateprocess, it is easy to understand how it came by analogy to symbolize thespiritual exercise of self-improvement (56).Hood The hood or cone-shaped hat often figures in ancient and mediaevaliconography. It is to be related with the Phrygian cap and other similar forms ofheadgear which are to be seen in Greek and Roman art. A relief of the 14th centuryshows Parsifal armed with two lances and wearing the cone-shaped cap charac-teristic of the Cabiri. It seems that the hood unites and blends together the twoseparate meanings of the cape and the hat; in addition, its shape and its colour"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"HORNS151contribute further to the symbolism as a whole (32). In Jung’s view, the hood,since it envelopes practically the whole of the head and is almost spherical inshape, comes to symbolize the highest sphere, that is, the celestial world (repre-sented symbolically by the bell, the vault, the upper part of the sand-bag and thedouble-pumpkin, as well as by the skull) (32). Furthermore, covering one’s headsignifies invisibility, that is, death. For this reason, the initiated appear in somescenes in ancient mystery plays with their heads covered by a cloak. Jung roundsoff the presentation of his evidence with this piece of information: ‘Among theNandi, of East Africa, the newly-circumcised, the initiates, have to go about for along time dressed in queer cone-shaped grass hats, which envelop them com-pletely and reach to the ground. The circumcised have become invisible, i.e.,spirits. The veil has the same significance among nuns’ (31). Diel confirms thisinterpretation, taking the hood as a symbolic agent of repression or that whichrenders the psychic content invisible (15).Horns Some of the unfavourable interpretations of horn-symbolism are dueto the all-too-common association with the ancient symbol of the ox (standing forcastration, sacrifice and persistent toil), or perhaps also as a result of ‘symbolicinversion’. For, in fact, all primitive traditions prove that the horn is a symbol ofstrength and power. Hides and battle-helmets were adorned with horns fromprehistoric times right up to the Middle Ages. The horn played its part in thedecorative art of Asiatic temples; like the bucraneum (representing sacrificialremains), the horn was considered sacred. The precise meaning of the horn-symbol was understood as far back as Egyptian times. In their system ofhieroglyphs, the sign of the horn indicates ‘what is above the head’ and, byextension, ‘to open up a path for oneself’ (in which it is comparable with theram’s head, Aries and the battering-ram). It is a striking fact that the signs whichinitiate the cycle of the Zodiac (Aries and Taurus) are both represented by hornedanimals (19). The relevant Egyptian hieroglyph also enters into composite wordssignifying elevation, prestige, glory, etc. (19). The single horn pertains in es-sence—apart from its employment in the emblem of the cornucopia or as amusical instrument—to the fabulous unicorn and the rhinoceros. The horn of thelatter, carved out in the form of a cup, is one of the ‘common emblems’ of China,and stands for prosperity (and therefore for strength) (5). The same belief isfound among the Gnostics, who expressly state that the horn symbolizes the‘principle which bestows maturity and beauty upon all things’. Jung offers theexplanation that the horn is a dual symbol: from one point of view it is penetrat-ing in shape, and therefore active and masculine in significance; and from theother, it is shaped like a receptacle, which is feminine in meaning (32). As a"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"HORSE152musical instrument, it figures in emblems symbolizing the spiritual call to join theHoly War. This particular meaning is corroborated by the crosses, trefoils, circlesand fleurs-de-lis associated with the horn (4). Horns are the attributes of theCilician god of agriculture. He holds handfuls of corn, symbolizing fertility.Horse The symbolism of the horse is extremely complex, and beyond acertain point not very clearly defined. Eliade finds it an animal associated withburial-rites in chthonian cults (17), whereas Mertens Stienon considers it anancient symbol of the cyclic movement of the world of phenomena; hence thehorses, which Neptune with his trident lashes up out of the waves, symbolize thecosmic forces that surge out of the Akasha—the blind forces of primigenial chaos(39). Applying this latter concept to the biopsychological plane, Diel concludesthat the horse stands for intense desires and instincts, in accordance with thegeneral symbolism of the steed-and the vehicle (15). The horse plays an impor-tant part in a great number of ancient rites. The ancient Rhodians used to make anannual sacrifice to the sun of a four-horse quadriga, which they would hurl intothe sea (21). The animal was also dedicated to Mars, and the sudden appearanceof a horse was thought to be an omen of war (8). In Germany and England, todream of a white horse was thought to be an omen of death (35). It is veryinteresting to note that the great myth and symbol of the Gemini, illustrated inpairs or twins, in two-headed beasts or in anthropomorphic figures with foureyes and four arms, etc., appears, too, in horse-symbolism, especially in the formof a pair of horses, one white and one black, representing life and death. TheIndian Asvins—the probable source of Castor and Pollux—would depict them-selves as horsemen. In mediaeval illustrations of the Zodiac, the sign for theGemini is sometimes portrayed in this way, as for example in the Zodiac of NotreDame de Paris (39). Considering that the horse pertains to the natural, uncon-scious, instinctive zone, it is not surprising that, in Antiquity, it should often havebeen endowed with certain powers of divination (8). In fable and legend, horses,being clairvoyant, are often assigned the task of giving a timely warning to theirmasters, as in the Grimms’ fable, for example. Jung came to wonder if the horsemight not be a symbol for the mother, and he does not hesitate to assert that itexpresses the magic side of Man, ‘the mother within us’, that is, intuitive under-standing. On the other hand, he recognizes that the horse is a symbol pertainingto Man’s baser forces, and also to water, which explains why the horse is associ-ated with Pluto and Neptune (56). Deriving from the magical nature of the horse,is the belief that the horse-shoe brings luck. On account of his fleetness, the horsecan also signify the wind and sea-foam, as well as fire and light. In the"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"HOUSE153Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (I, 1), the horse is actually a symbol of the cosmos(31) (Plate XVIII).Hour-Glass A symbol denoting the inversion of the relations between theUpper and Lower Worlds—an inversion encompassed periodically by Shiva (orSiva), the lord of creation and destruction. Connected with it are the drum—similar in shape—and the cross of St. Andrew; the symbolic significance of allthree is identical (51).Hours, The In the Iliad, the hours are personifications of the atmosphericmoisture: they open and close the gates of Olympus, form and disperse theclouds, govern the seasons and human life. While they were performing theseduties, they were regarded as daughters of Zeus and Themis, bearing such namesas Eunomia, Dike and Irene, representing Law, Justice and Peace. All twelveconstitute the retinue of Eos and are depicted ranged around the sun-throne orbusily coupling the horses to the sun-chariot. We must observe, therefore: (a)that they are expressive of cosmic forces; (b) that they personify moments ofthese forces and therefore create the opportunities for human action. Their posi-tion, surrounding the sun, is analogous to the way angels (red and blue—positiveand negative) are depicted encircling the mandorla of God in Christian iconogra-phy.House Mystics have always traditionally considered the feminine aspect ofthe universe as a chest, a house or a wall, as well as an enclosed garden. Anothersymbolic association is that which equates the house (and the above, relatedforms) with the repository of all wisdom, that is, tradition itself (4). In architec-tural symbolism, on the other hand, the house carries not only an overall symbol-ism but also particular associations attached to each of its component parts.Nevertheless, the house as a home arouses strong, spontaneous associations withthe human body and human thought (or life, in other words), as has been con-firmed empirically by psychoanalysts. Ania Teillard explains this by pointingout that, in dreams, we employ the image of the house as a representation of thedifferent layers of the psyche. The outside of the house signifies the outwardappearance of Man: his personality or his mask. The various floors are related tothe vertical and spatial symbols. The roof and upper floor correspond to the headand the mind, as well as to the conscious exercise of self-control. Similarly, thebasement corresponds to the unconscious and the instincts (just as sewers do, insymbols pertaining to the city). The kitchen, since this is where foodstuff istransformed, sometimes signifies the place or the moment of psychic transmuta-tion in the alchemical sense. The intercommunicating rooms speak for them-selves. The stairs are the link between the various planes of the psyche, but their"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"HUNTER154particular significance depends upon whether they are seen as ascending or de-scending. Finally, there is, as we have said, the association of the house with thehuman body, especially regarding its openings, as was well understood byArtemidorus Daldianus (56).Hunter In Ludovico Dolce’s Le Transformationi, the following scene isdescribed: In a clearing in a wood there is a small lake, with a man, kneeling, gazinginto the surface of the water—a symbol of contemplation. In the background, ahunter on horseback, with a pack of dogs, is in pursuit of his prey—a symbol ofaction for its own sake, of repetition, of the pursuit of transitoriness, of the willto remain (as the Hindu phrase has it) on the ‘wheel of reincarnations’. Lao-Tse(58) taught that racing and hunting only serve to madden the heart of Man, thusrevealing that the enemy is within: that it is desire itself. Similarly, Zagreus—another name for Dionysos—means ‘the Great Hunter’ and stands for the insa-tiable incontinence of desire (15), according to the moral interpretation of Diel.For those who prefer a cosmic interpretation, the myth of the infernal hunt, inwhich colour and form are mixed together without rhyme or reason, alludes to thehowling wind (3). The Arabs identify this wind with both the hunter and death(35). The figure of the accursed hunter is one which is to be found in a great manymythologies, traditions, legends and folktales. The following passage taken fromJulio Caro Baroja will illuminate many aspects of the myth, and clarify what wehave already said: ‘A Basque tradition (Abade chacurra: the abbot’s dogs) has itthat an abbot or priest, much drawn to hunting, was saying Mass just as a harehappened to run past. The Abbot’s dogs caught its scent and rushed out, howling,after it; the abbot deserted the Most Holy Sacrament, and hastened out of thetemple after his dogs in pursuit of the prey. Henceforth, as a punishment, he wascondemned to an endless chase, whirling across the plains behind his howlingdogs, never to run down the quarry he so bootlessly pursues.’ This is clearly acase of a symbol for a ‘limiting situation’, that is, of a falling away from thecentre—or the tendency to do so—towards the endlessly turning periphery ofthe wheel of phenomena: unending because self-delusion is a perpetual incite-ment to the sterile urge of the pursuit of worldly things. In other versions the hareis the devil disguised. This theme of the accursed hunter is to be found called,variously. ‘The Black Hunter’, ‘The Wicked Hunter’ or ‘The King’s Dog’. It isderived from the myth of Odin, the god of souls. Amongst the so-called Celticpeoples, Odin has been replaced by King Arthur or Arthus, as is shown by the‘chasses du roi Arthus’, traditional in Normandy. There are other similar tradi-tions, such as the ‘chasse Annequin’ in Normandy, ‘Manihennequin’ in the Vosges,"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"IBIS155the ‘chasse Saint Hubert’ and ‘du Grand Veneur’ (10). In Dontenville’s view, animportant mythic precedent is to be found in Meleager and the boar (16).Hurricane Anthropologists have found that many graphic symbols owetheir origin to the hurricane—especially in America. This is true, for instance, ofthe sigma, the double sigma and the swastika. But at the same time, the hurricanehas a symbolic meaning of its own. Ortiz observes that the hurricane, like celestialbodies, has two characteristic motions: rotary and sideways. In its sidewisemotion, there is an intermediary point of absolute calm: the so-called ‘eye of thehurricane’. For American aborigines, the hurricane is cosmic synergy, since itcontains three Elements within itself (fire or light-rays, air or wind, water or rain)and disturbs the fourth—earth. It was worshipped as a deity of the winds andwaters, and also of the heavens (41). This latter aspect of its correspondencesbrings us once again to the celebrated, and persistent celestial symbol of the ‘hole’in the disc of Chinese jade, representing the concept of the zenith as a voidthrough which one may pass out of the world of space and time into spacelessnessand timelessness.Hyle Hyle is protomatter, a symbol of the passive, feminine, primordialprinciple. According to Nicomachus of Gerasa, the pristine state of chaos of thehyle was fecundated by Number. Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179), the abbess ofRupertsberg, in Scivias, describes cosmogonic visions in which Nous blends andharmonizes with the monster chaos (14).IIbis The ibis is related to Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom. According tothe Greek scholar Aelian, in his De Natura Animalium, this bird was chosenbecause it tucks its head under its wing when it sleeps, so that it comes toresemble the shape of the heart; and also because of the fact that the stride of theibis measures exactly a cubit (which was the measure used in the building oftemples), and because it destroyed harmful insects (19). There were two kinds ofibis: the white bird (associated with the moon) and the black. The belief was thatThoth hovered over the Egyptian people in the form of an Ibis religiosa, and thathe taught them the occult arts and sciences (9)."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"ICE      156Ice Given that water is the symbol of communication between the formal andthe informal, the element of transition between different cycles, yielding bynature, and also related to the ideas of material, earthly fecundity and the Heraclitean‘death of the soul’, it follows that ice represents principally two things: first, thechange induced in water by the cold—that is, the ‘congelation’ of its symbolicsignificance; and, secondly, the stultification of the potentialities of water. Henceice has been defined as the rigid dividing-line between consciousness and theunconscious (or between any other dynamic levels) (56). Although the negativesense is predominant, it is not lacking in a positive sense in so far as the solidifi-cation is tantamount to toughness, and the coldness implies resistance to all thatis inferior; in this latter sense it corresponds to Nietzsche’s freezing and ‘hostile’air of mountain-peaks.Identities Many symbols can, like the gods of old, be equated, relativelyspeaking, one with another. For example: the Ship of Fools and the Endless Chase(of the Accursed Hunter); or the ‘centre’ of the cross and the Holy Grail; or thecentaur and the Gemini; or Pandora’s box and effulgence. In the proper applica-tion of identities lies much of the true science of symbolism.Image A pattern of forms and figures endowed with unity and significance.It is implied in the theory of form—and is true, also, of melody—that the wholeis greater than the sum of its parts being, in a sense, their origin and justification.If for Sartre the image is a degraded awareness of knowing, for other psycholo-gists the image is, in fact, the highest form that knowing can assume, for allknowledge tends towards a visual synthesis. Also to be borne in mind is thetheory propounded by Sir Herbert Read in Icon and Idea, according to whichevery creation in the visual arts—and, in fact, every kind of pattern—is a form ofthought and therefore corresponds to an intelligible mental concept. This leads ustowards an intuition of the world as a vast repertoire of signs that await being‘read’. We may note here that some of the works of Trithemius and AthanasiusKircher tend towards this interpretation.Image, Pictorial Every pictorial creation gives rise to an image, whetherimitative or invented, with or without figuration. Alongside the symbolic meaningwhich subjects or figures may have, they possess, in a pictorial image, a symbolicbackground: spatial zones, colours, geometric or non-geometric forms, predomi-nant axes, rhythms, composition and texture. In the most recent type of art,known as ‘informalism’, expression and symbolization are achieved through tex-ture and lineal rhythm in particular, with colour taking a secondary rôle.

Exactly the same thing occurs in architecture and sculpture.Imago Ignota From about the middle of the last century, the tendency ofpoetry and the visual arts has been towards a mode of expression whose anteced-ents go back through the ages—but received a particular impetus, around the year1800, from the works of William Blake—and which might, with justification, betermed hermetic. This movement was characterized by the quest for the obscureas a self-sufficient goal, and by the representation of ‘harmonious wholes’ whosefascination lies in their remoteness. There is an illuminating definition of poetryin this sense by the German poet Gottfried Benn: ‘The writing of poetry is theelevation of things into the language of the incomprehensible.’ It is this type ofunfamiliar pattern that constitutes the ‘unknown image’—a pattern of words,shapes or colours that has no correspondence with the normal, either in the worldof exterior reality or in that of normal, human feelings. These ‘unknown images’create their own kind of reality and express the spiritual need of particular indi-viduals to live within this created reality. They symbolize, in sum, the unknown,the antecedents and the aftermath of man, or that which surrounds him and whichhis senses and his intelligence are incapable of apprehending or of appropriating.The scope of the unknown is immense, for it encompasses the Supreme Mysteryor the Mystery of mysteries (the secret of the cosmos and of creation and thenature of Being), and also the psychological—and, indeed, existential—mysteryof the ‘unexplored’. What is unknown is that which is unformed. The ‘unknownimage’ is also related to death and to the thread which connects death with life(Plate XIX).Impossibilities This theme of the ‘impossible’ is one which appears veryfrequently in legends and folktales, embracing, for example, the life of the unborn,or the fruit of one tree growing upon another, etc. Some refrains reflect the sameideas, such as the well-known Spanish saying: ‘Over the sea run the hares, overthe mountain the sardines.’ They may well be symbols of Inversion, but it seemsclear that they are more likely to pertain to subversion. There is a possiblerelationship between such impossibilities, as well as errors or comedies of mis-taken identity—likewise owing their origin to folklore—and the belief in theexistence of beings, imps and goblins bent upon creating disorder. Father La Peña,in his work El ente dilucidado, has discussed the problem of whether men can livewithout eating, whether they can fly, and so on. In short, all these examples maybe interpreted as a ‘call to chaos’: symbols of the regressive, orgiastic desire (10),comparable with certain aspects of surrealism."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"INCEST      158Incest Whereas the union of analogous matter is a symbol of incest—inmusic, for example, the idea of a concerto for harp and piano—incest in itselfsymbolizes, according to Jung, the longing for union with the essence of one’sown self, or, in other words, for individuation. This explains why the gods ofantiquity very frequently engendered offspring through incestuous relationships(33).Instruments Symbolically, they are objective portrayals of potentialities,actions and desires. Each instrument, therefore, possesses a purely literal mean-ing, as well as a further significance when it is applied to the psychological andspiritual plane.Intersection The intersection of two lines, objects or paths is a sign of‘Conjunction’ and communication, but also of symbolic Inversion, that is, of thatpoint or zone where a transcendental change of direction is induced or sought.This is what lies behind the superstitious crossing of fingers or of objects. Inmedicinal dances, swords and iron bars are crossed in order to encourage a change(that is, a cure), or, to put it another way, to alter the course of a process so thatit does not reach its ordinary or expected outcome (51).Intestines An Egyptian determinative sign defining the concept of circula-tion (19). In a broader sense, intestines carry the same symbolism as the alembic.They are also connected with the labyrinth and with death (the return to theinterior of the earth = mother, along the ‘curved way’ = Saturn’s scythe).Inversion According to Schneider, the continuity of life is assured by themutual sacrifice which is consummated on the peak of the mystic mountain:death permits birth; all opposites are for an instant fused together and theninverted. What is constructive turns to destruction; love turns to hate; evil togood; unhappiness to happiness; martyrdom to ecstasy. Corresponding to thisinner inversion of a process is an outer inversion of the symbol pertaining to it.This gives rise to a reversed arrangement of the symbolic structure. When thesymbol has two aspects, the inversion of one determines that of the other. So, forexample, if what is below is black and it seeks to ascend, it may do so by turningwhite. Or, conversely, if what is black is below and seeks to turn to white, then letit ascend and white it will be. This ‘symbolic logic’ of Inversion is, it hardly needsto be said, closely bound up with the myth of sacrifice. The more terrible thesituation, the more urgent the need to transform and invert it (as in a publiccalamity or an unsuccessful war) and the greater must be the sacrifice; this ex-plains the sacrifice of the Carthaginians and the pre-Columbian Mexicans. Thereis a psychological basis to this, since the mind, through the process of sublima-tion, is always promoting inversions and metamorphoses of this order. Ambiva-"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"159    INVISIBILITYlence, contrast, paradox, or the coincidentia oppositorum, are capable, on accountof their transcendent implications, of pointing the way to the other world, or ofpointing, in a more practical way, to the focal point of Inversion. Jung observesthat this is why the alchemists would express the unknowable by means ofcontrasts (33); and Schneider notes that, since the world is a duality, each phe-nomenon or thesis is denoted by its opposite. The closer phenomena come to thefocal point of Inversion, the more they tend to collide with one another. Thenumerical expression of Inversion seems to be two and eleven. Symbols of Inver-sion are: the double-spiral, the hour-glass, the drum shaped like an hour-glass, St.Andrew’s cross, the letter X, the quiver of arrows, and, in general, all that is X-shaped. Hence, the superstitious act of crossing the fingers is tantamount totempting Fate; and, similarly, crime is a feature of many desperate rites, whileprimitives often insult the dead, because the insults, after passing through thefocal point, are inverted—like rays of light—and changed into praise (50). Alsosymbolizing Inversion are all those beings or objects which are depicted upsidedown, such as the figure of the Hanged Man in the Tarot pack, the bat or vampirehanging from rock or branch, the acrobat on the trapeze, and so on. Still otherexamples of Inversion are those which tend to take the form of an antithesis; forexample, according to L. Charbonneau Lassay in Le Bestiaire du Christ (Bruges,1940), the malevolent animals—the toad, the scorpion, the rhinoceros and thebasilisk—are the natural enemies respectively of the beneficent animals—thefrog, the scarab, the unicorn and the cock. Similarly, the wasp is the antithesis ofthe bee, the he-goat of the crow. There are some inversions of symbols which owetheir origins to racial or national factors, or to a change in the predominant caste:in Islam, politeness demands that the man should not remove his headgear, theopposite being the case in Christian countries. An instance of positive, historicalsublimating inversion might be some humiliating situation—such as that in whichthe Roman army was made to pass under the yoke at Caudium—transformedinto one of glory (with its characteristic expression of the triumphal arch, whichwas a particular obsession of the Romans). The custom among certain layers ofsociety of turning the head of a saint downwards, or against a wall, is less anintended ‘punishment’ for the holy image than a consequence of the symbolismof Inversion: by inverting the physical position of the effigy, the faithful hope toinvert his attitude towards them, and by virtue of the change in his attitude, toinduce a change in their destiny.Invisibility To become or to be invisible, psychologically corresponds torepression or to what is repressed.

These attributes denote the continuity of life, thepower of invigorating liquids such as water, milk, blood and soma (related to thedraught which Isolde gives to Tristan to drink), and the hardships of existence.Her weapons announce quite clearly that Ishtar loves the hero and despises thecoward (59).Island A complex symbol embracing several different meanings. According toJung, the island is the refuge from the menacing assault of the ‘sea’ of the uncon-scious, or, in other words, it is the synthesis of the consciousness and the will(33). Here he is following the Hindu belief that—as Zimmer notes—the island isto be seen as the area of metaphysical force where the forces of the ‘immenseillogic’ of the ocean are distilled (60). At the same time, the island is also a symbolof isolation, of solitude, of death. Most island-deities have something funerealabout them—Calypso for instance. One could perhaps postulate an equation (ofcounterpoise and identity) between island and woman on the one hand, andmonster and hero on the other.Island, Accursed In the Lai de Joseph d’Arimathie, of the Romanesqueperiod, the existence of an Accursed Island, which harboured infernal apparitions,enchantments, tortures and dangers, was postulated along with that of a HappyIsland. This is the equivalent of the black castle in other legends. In both cases, itexpresses the law of polarity which contrasts the Lower and the Upper Worlds,either on opposite sides of the earth, or above and below it.Island of the Blessed Hindu doctrine tells of an ‘essential island’, golden androunded, whose banks are made of pulverised gems, giving rise to its name of the‘island of the gems’. Sweet-smelling trees flourish on the land, and in the centre isa palace—the oriental equivalent of the lapis philosophorum. Inside the palace, ina jewelled pavilion, is the enthroned Magna Mater (60). According to Krappe, the‘Island of the Blessed’ in its Greek version was the Land of the Dead (35), that is,a symbol, albeit a negative one, of the ‘Centre’ itself. Krappe goes on to speak ofthe perennial validity of the symbol, recalling how the Spanish nobleman JuanPonce de León set off in search of Bimini and discovered Florida.

Blavatsky observes that ‘Tradition says,and the records of the Book of Dzyan explain, that . . . where now are found butsalt lakes and desolate barren deserts, there was a vast inland sea, which extendedover middle Asia . . . (and) an island (of) unparalleled beauty’ and this island wasan exact copy of the island situated in the midst of the zodiacal wheel in theUpper Ocean (or the Ocean of the heavens). The signs of the Zodiac are them-selves conceived as twelve islands (9). Finally, the Island of the Blessed (or theHappy Island) seems to be symbolic of earthly paradise for most classical writ-ers. Schneider mentions the island visited by St. Brendan, according to mediaevallegend, where there was a huge tree growing near a fountain, and on its brancheslived many birds. Two rivers flowed across the island: one was the river of youthand the other that of death (51). Here we have the clearest possible example oflandscape-symbolism in which the terrestrial substance is integrated into a cos-mic pattern by means of the essential elements of traditional symbolism.Ivy Consecrated by the Phrygians to their god Attis. The eunuch-prieststattooed themselves with patterns of ivy leaves (21). It is a feminine symboldenoting a force in need of protection.JJade The traditional Chinese symbolism of jade with its peculiar character-istics is derived from the broader universal symbolism of lithophanies. Accordingto the Chinese tradition, jade possesses an essential quality of immortality as ofright. Hence, it figured in rites and invocations from the 3rd millennium before ourera: in figures of dragons and tigers, for example, which were intended to repre-sent the cycle of decrease and increase in natural forces. This symbolism is dealtwith in the Chou Li, dating from the 12th century B.C. It lists six ritual imple-ments of jade: Pi, Ts’ung, Hu, Huan, Kuei, Chang. The Pi-symbol is a disk witha central hole signifying heaven, which is, as it were, a zone of perfect emptiness.Hu is a jade tiger. Huan is like a Pi, but is of black jade broken into two or threepieces; it is used in Chinese magic, particularly in the practices of necromancy.Ts’ung is the symbol of the earth; rounded inside and square outside, it is usually"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"JANUS162made of yellow jade (39). Generally speaking, jade corresponds to the masculine,Yang principle and to the dry Element.Janus A Roman deity who is represented with two faces joined along the linefrom ear to jaw, the two faces looking in opposite directions. Like all symbolsfacing right and left at the same time, Janus is a symbol of wholeness—of thedesire to master all things. Because of its duality, it may be taken to signify allpairs of opposites—that is, to be equivalent to the myth of the Gemini. It seemsthat the Romans associated Janus essentially with destiny, time and war. Hisfaces were turned towards the past and the future, denoting both awareness ofhistory and foreknowledge (the two-headed eagle has a comparable significance).But, as Guénon has rightly pointed out, two heads are, in fact, hindrances to theknowledge of true destiny, which lies in the ‘eternal present’ (25). This explainswhy many peoples (those of Northern Europe for example) invented similarsymbols but with three heads arranged in the form of a rotating triangle, after thefashion of Janus, but with a third head facing forward. Triform Hecate is repre-sented in this way (59). Janus also symbolizes the union of the powers of priestand monarch (28). Marius Schneider has suggested to us that Janus may also beidentified with the two-peaked Mountain of Mars and, consequently, with allsymbols of Inversion and mutual sacrifice.Jerusalem, The Celestial ‘And (the city) had a wall great and high, and hadtwelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which arethe names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel. On the east three gates; onthe north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. Andthe wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelveapostles of the Lamb’ (Revelation xxi, 12-14). ‘And he shewed me a pure river ofwater of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of theLamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there thetree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month:and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations’ (Revelation xxii, 1-2). The celestial Jerusalem is usually described as a city in which the mineralelement is predominant, whereas the lost Paradise is portrayed as a garden whichis mostly vegetable in composition. Guénon, in noting this, has posed the ques-tion of whether we should ‘say that the vegetation represents the proliferation ofthe seeds in the sphere of vital assimilation, whereas the minerals represent theresults definitively “fixed”—”crystallized” as it were—at the close of a cyclicprocess of growth’ (27). He links the twelve gates with the signs of the Zodiac,deducing that in this symbol a temporal cycle is transformed into a spatial one,upon the world’s ceasing to rotate (28). St. John’s apocalyptic vision, then, apart"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"JEWELS AND GEMS163from its prophetic value, is a description, in terms of symbolic logic, of the all-embracing, unifying, ‘saved’ character of the paradise-to-be, seen as a ‘new city’.Jester The jester is the symbolic inversion of the king, and hence, in certainrites of the period immediately preceding history, it appears in association withthe sacrificial victim. According to Schneider, he is the terrestrial counterpart ofthe Gemini, that is to say that the jester is an expression of duality and not acomic figure. The jester or clown says pleasant things harshly and terrible thingsjokingly (50). Certain deformed or abnormal beings, such as dwarfs, are closelyrelated to, and even identical with, the figure of the jester. Frazer relates of AsiaMinor in the 6th century B.C. how ‘when a city suffered from plague, famine, orother public calamity, an ugly or deformed person was chosen to take uponhimself all the evils which afflicted the community. He was brought to a suitableplace, where dried figs, a barley loaf and cheese were put into his hand. These heate. Then he was beaten seven times upon his genital organs with squills andbranches of the wild fig and other wild trees while the flutes played a particulartune. Afterwards he was burned on a pyre built of the wood of forest trees; andhis ashes were cast into the sea’ (21). This passage illustrates the ‘inverted’function of the victim and shows how, by way of suffering and sacrifice, theinferior creature could be sublimated into a superior being.Jewels and Gems In most symbolic traditions, jewels signify spiritualtruths (4); the precious stones in the garments of princesses, or in necklaces andbracelets, as well as gems shut away in hidden rooms, are symbols of superiorknowledge (38). In the case of jewels belonging to princesses or ladies-in-waiting,they are clearly a symbol closely connected with the Jungian ‘anima’. Treasuresguarded by dragons allude to the difficulties of the struggle for knowledge—knowledge not as science in the sense of an impersonal erudition, but as the sumof experiences, and inextricably bound up with living and with evolution. Gemshidden in caves refer to the intuitive knowledge harboured in the unconscious.Another interesting connotation sometimes appearing in mythic form and stillalive today in superstitions is that which associates the gem, symbolic of knowl-edge as such, with the snake, representing energy which tends towards a givenend. The best example is the legend of the ‘snake’s stone’. There are manyfolklore traditions which illustrate the belief that precious stones once fell fromthe head of snakes or dragons. This gave rise to the idea that the diamond ispoisonous and that it was once to be found in the jaws of serpents (according tothe Hindu, Hellenistic and Arabic belief), or that all precious stones originated intheir saliva (according to a belief widespread in primitive cultures from the FarEast to England). These myths express the maximum degree of proximity pos-"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"JOURNEY164sible between ‘protector’ and ‘adversary’—between, that is, the guarding ‘mon-ster’ and the guarded ‘treasure’. They constitute a synthesis of opposites, anamalgam in which the antitheses become all but identical within an ambivalentpsychological zone marking out a common fund of significance between theantithetical meanings. Eliade notes that metaphysical emblems, watched over byserpents or dragons, come to be represented by specific objects located in theforehead, the eyes or mouth of these ophidia (17). At the same time, preciousstones incorporate the general symbolism of lithophanies, sublimated in the per-fection and beauty of the gems. This is why Gougenot des Mousseaux, in hisDieu et les Dieux, emphasizes the important part always played by stones. Theaerolite, in particular, because of its connexion with the celestial sphere, repre-sents the mansion and the vestments of a god descended upon earth. Shootingstars are related to angels. There is another tradition which imparts an infernalshade of meaning to the precious stone, by reason of the ‘obscure’ nature of theknowledge which it connotes. Plainly, in this case it is the feeling of aversiontowards the material richness of the stone that prevails over—or is allied with—admiration for its hardness, colour and transparency. In this connexion, BaronGuiraud, in La Philosophie de l’histoire, comments that, when Lucifer fell, angeliclight was given corporeal form in the shining stars and glittering gems. Jewels havealso been equated with metals, as a kind of ‘subterranean astronomy’, and in fact,through the application of the theory of correspondences, with every other orderof existence. All kinds of glistening specks of colour, too, may contain some of thesymbolic sense of particular precious stones, but only as secondary meaningsand by association with the essential symbolism of the stone itself. The Hebrewswere well aware of the symbolic significance of jewels and made use of it in theirliturgy. Lévi, in Les Mystères du Rational d’Aaron, recalls that The Rational,consisting of twelve precious stones (representing the twelve months of the year,and the signs of the Zodiac), was arranged as four lines with three stones in each,and the type and colour of the stones, from left to right and from top to bottomwere: sardonyx (red), emerald (green), topaz (yellow), ruby (red tending to or-ange), jasper (deep green), sapphire (deep blue), jacinth (lilac), amethyst (violet),agate (milky), chrysolite (golden blue), beryl (darkish blue), and onyx (pink).Each one of these stones had a given magic ability. The order in which they appearis based upon their colour and luminosity, decreasing, as in a tongue of flame,from top to bottom and from the outside to the centre’ (59).Journey From the spiritual point of view, the journey is never merely apassage through space, but rather an expression of the urgent desire for discoveryand change that underlies the actual movement and experience of travelling. Hence,"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"JOURNEY INTO HELL165to study, to inquire, to seek or to live with intensity through new and profoundexperiences are all modes of travelling or, to put it another way, spiritual andsymbolic equivalents of the journey. Heroes are always travellers, in that they arerestless. Travelling, Jung observes, is an image of aspiration, of an unsatisfiedlonging that never finds its goal, seek where it may (31). He goes on to point outthat this goal is in fact the lost Mother; but this is a moot point, for we mightequally well say that, on the contrary, its journey is a flight from the Mother.Flying, swimming and running are other activities which may be equated withtravelling; and so also are dreaming, day-dreaming and imagining. Crossing a fordmarks the decisive stage in the passage from one state to another (56). There is aconnexion between the symbolism of the journey, in its cosmic sense, and thesymbolism of the essential landscape of megalithic cults (or that seen by theshamans in their visions). Travelling may also be related to the complete cycle ofthe year or to the attempt to escape from it, depending upon certain secondarycharacteristics of the journey. But the true Journey is neither acquiescence norescape—it is evolution. For this reason Guénon has suggested that ordeals ofinitiation frequently take the form of ‘symbolic journeys’ representing a questthat starts in the darkness of the profane world (or of the unconscious—themother) and gropes towards the light. Such ordeals or trials—like the stages in ajourney—are rites of purification (29). The archetype of the journey is the pil-grimage to the ‘Centre’ or the holy land—or the way out of the maze. The NightSea-Crossing, equivalent to the Journey into Hell, illustrates certain basic aspectsof journey-symbolism which still call for elucidation. Primarily, to travel is toseek. The Turkish Kalenderi sect require their initiates to travel ceaselessly, since,as we have suggested, travelling is often invested with a higher, sublimatorysignificance.Journey into Hell Dante’s descent into the inferno was anticipated by thatof Aeneas in the Aeneid of Virgil, as well as by the journey of Orpheus. AsínPalacios, in his Escatología musulmana de la Divina Comedia (Madrid, 1919)—quoted by Guénon—has suggested that the Florentine poet based the path whichhe traced, as well as the pattern of the three worlds that he draws, upon the twoworks of Mohiddin ibn Arabi (who preceded him by more than eighty years),entitled The Book of the Journey by Night and Revelations of Mecca (27). Fromthe symbolic point of view, and leaving aside the otherworldly implications of thetwo complementary universes—the ‘central level of manifestation’ and the ter-restrial—the Journey into Hell symbolizes the descent into the unconscious, orthe awareness of all the potentialities of being—cosmic and psychological—thatare needed in order to reach the Paradisiac heights, except, that is, the divinely"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"JOURNEY OF THE SOUL166chosen few who attain to these heights by the path of innocence. Hell fusestogether the ideas of ‘crime and punishment’, just as purgatory embraces thenotions of penitence and forgiveness.Journey of the Soul According to Hindu belief, the individual, upon freeinghimself from the shackles of the manifest world, follows a route which is theinverse of that path which he took when entering into it. Within this system ofthought there are two possible paths which he may take: either that of theliberated (dêva-yâna or the ‘way of the gods’) or else that followed by those whostill have further states of individuation to pass through (pitri-yâna or the ‘way ofthe ancestors’). As the Bhagavad-Gitâ observes: ‘At this juncture, those whotend towards union, without having actually achieved it, leave manifest existencebehind them, some to return to it later, others never to return. . . . Fire, light, day,the crescent moon, the half-year of the sun’s ascendence and its northerly course—these are the luminous signs which lead to Brahma those who acknowledge Brahma.Smoke, night, the waning moon, the half-year when the sun descends towards thesouth—such are the signs that lead to lunar light and immediately to the return tostates of manifestation’ (26).Judgement, The Day of The twentieth enigma of the Tarot pack, represent-ing the resurrection of the dead in the valley of Jehoshaphat, when the angel of theApocalypse sounds the last trump. This angel has a sun-symbol on his foreheadand his golden hair further emphasizes his sun-symbolism. Death, in the sym-bolic sense, is equivalent to the death of the soul—to ignoring the transcendentalaim of Man. The tomb is the body and fleshly desires. The angel, by means bothof his light and of his trumpet-call, ‘awakens’ the latent desire for resurrection inthe man who has fallen into iniquity. The constellation which shows the closestaffinity with this enigma is the Swan of Leda, the harbinger of the final ‘Conjunc-tion’. On the positive side, this card stands for illumination, regeneration, healingand resurrection. On the negative side, for hot-headedness and Dionysiac ecstasy(59).Juice Juice or sap represents life-giving liquid. It is a sacrificial symbolconnected with blood and also with light as the distillation of igniferous bodies,suns and stars.Jupiter Among the Graeco-Roman gods, he corresponds to the supremevirtues of the judgement and the will. As the lord of the sky, his infernal counter-parts are Pluto, the lord of the chthonian world, and Neptune as the lord of thedeeps (symbolizing the unconscious). Jupiter’s attributes are the thunderbolt,the crown, the eagle and the throne (8)."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"KEY167Justice The eighth enigma of the Tarot, this is an allegory of the idea ofjustice personified as an image rather like that of the Empress, depicted full-faceand symmetrical (this being symbolic of exact, bilateral equilibrium) with a redtunic and a blue cloak. In one hand, she holds up a pair of scales (symbolic of theequilibrium of good and evil), and in the other a sword (for psychic decisiveness,and the Word of God). Her throne is like the Emperor’s, massively stable. Acrown with fleurons shaped like iron lances surmounts the headdress of thisallegorical figure. The enigma is related to Libra, the sign of the Zodiac, and, likeit, represents not so much external justice or social legality as inner judgementsetting in motion the entire psychic (or psychosomatic) mechanism involved inthe process of determining guilt; the idea behind this is basically the same asWeininger’s concept of sin as intrinsically indistinct from punishment. Astro-nomically speaking, Justice is Astrea. In the positive sense, this enigma denotesharmony, a strict code of behaviour and firmness; in the negative sense, restric-tion, pettiness and craft (59).KKey As an attribute, it pertains to several mythic characters, including Hecate(31). It is symbolic of mystery or enigma, or of a task to be performed, and themeans of carrying it out. It sometimes refers to the threshold of the unconscious(32). The key to knowledge corresponds, within the cycle of the year, to themonth of June (healing). The conjunction of the symbols of the male dove and thekey signifies the spirit opening the gates of heaven (4). The emblem formed bytwo keys, sometimes placed over a heart, relates to Janus (4). In legend andfolklore, three keys are often used to symbolize a like number of secret chambersfull of precious objects. They are symbolic representations of initiation andknowledge. The first key, of silver, concerns what can be revealed by psychologi-cal understanding; the second is made of gold, and pertains to philosophicalwisdom; the third and last, of diamond, confers the power to act (38). The findingof a key signifies the stage prior to the actual discovery of the treasure, foundonly after great difficulties.

But it should perhapsbe pointed out that, in this case, it is the keys that derive from the anserated cross,the archetype of the key of Eternal Life that opens up the gates of death on toimmortality.King In the broadest and most abstract sense, the king symbolizes universaland archetypal Man. As such, according to animistic and astrobiological ways ofthought widespread from India to Ireland (21), he possesses magic and super-natural powers. He also expresses the ruling or governing principle, supremeconsciousness, and the virtues of sound judgement and self-control (56). At thesame time, a coronation is equivalent to achievement, victory and consummation(33). Hence any man may properly be called a king when he achieves the culmi-nating point in the unfolding of his individual life. Deriving from, and equatedwith the king-symbolism are the symbols for gold, the sun and Jupiter. Thesesymbols imply in essence the idea that the king is Man transposed to the solarplane, to the ideal or ‘golden’ situation—that is, ‘saved’ and made eternal. Theidea of immortality was passed from god to monarch, and only later was itvouchsafed to the hero and later still to ordinary mortals in so far as they meritedthe ‘crown’ of success, having overcome certain obstacles (usually of a moralorder). The king, quite apart from all this, may also symbolize the ‘royalty’—’orgrandeur—of Man. In this case, he may be subjected to a period of unfavourableor painful circumstances; when this is so, the particular symbol becomes that ofthe ‘sick king’ (like Amfortas in Parsifal), or of the ‘sea-king’ (signifying thenegative aspect of humanity) (32). Love also plays a highly important part in thesymbolism of royalty, since love is held to be one of the most obvious of culmi-nating points in the life of Man. This is why the bride and bridegroom in theGreek marriage-ceremony wear crowns made of some precious metal. The kingand queen together comprise the perfect image of the hieros gamos, of the unionof heaven and earth, sun and moon, gold and silver, sulphur and mercury; and—according to Jung—they also signify the spiritual ‘conjunction’ that takes placewhen the process of individuation is complete, with the harmonious union of theunconscious and consciousness. The title of king is bestowed upon the mostoutstanding specimen in every species or type: so, the lion is the king of beasts,as is the eagle of birds or gold among the metals (57). To come back to thesymbolism of the ‘sick king’, he—like such afflicted heroes as Philoctetes—signifies, on the one hand, the punishment which pursues sin as the shadowfollows the body (given the existence of the light of consciousness), and, on theother, sterility of spirit. A particularly significant instance of the symbolic pro-"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"KNIGHT169cess is implied by the king’s projecting his spiritual state on to nature around him,as happens with Amfortas in Parsifal, in the Waste Land of Eliot, and, to someextent, the Fall of the House of Usher by Poe. As for the ‘sea-king’, he is symbolicof the ocean (another version of Neptune) and therefore personifies the deeps ofthe unconscious in their regressive and evil form as opposed to the waters of the‘Upper Ocean’ (the clouds, rain or fresh water) which are fecund (32). The ‘agedking’—such as Dhritarashtra, the aged monarch of Vedic epics, or king Lear, or allthose aged kings of legends and folktales—is symbolic of the world-memory, orthe collective unconscious in its widest and most all-embracing sense (38). Theking often exhibits, in concentrated form, the characteristics of the father and thehero, and there is a touch of the Messianic about him; by inversion of the tempo-ral order of things, what is past becomes ‘what is to pass’ and the dead king issupposed by his subjects to be living a strange existence as a ghost, later to returnto his country when it is in great danger. This legend tends to accrue to the namesof historical monarchs,who have fallen in strange or unhappy circumstances, as inthe case of the Portuguese dom Sebastian or that of don Rodrigo, the last of theGothic kings. The supreme example is the mythic king Arthur, called by MaloryArthurus, rex quondam, rexque futurus (q.v.) (16).Knife A symbol which is the inversion of sword-symbolism. It is associatedwith vengeance and death, but also with sacrifice (8). The short blade of the kniferepresents, by analogy, the primacy of the instinctive forces in the man wieldingit, whereas the long blade of the sword illustrates the spiritual height of theswordsman.Knight A symbol which confirms what we have suggested concerning thesteed. He is the master, the logos, the spirit which prevails over the mount (thatis, over matter). But this is possible only after a lengthy period of apprentice-ship, which may be seen, historically speaking, as a real attempt to create in theknight a human type superior to all others. As a consequence, the education of theknight was directed in part to strengthening him physically, but in particular todeveloping his soul and spirit, his affections (that is, his morals) and his mind(that is, his reason) in order to prepare him adequately for the task of directingand controlling the real world, so that he might take his proper place in thehierarchies of the universe (that is, in the feudal hierarchy, ordered after thecelestial pattern, ranging from the baron up to the king). We also find mountedmonks, priests and laymen skilfully controlling their steed, thereby demonstrat-ing their allegiance to the spiritual (or symbolic) order of knighthood in deliberatecompetition with the historico-social order of knights. This is why in the bas-reliefs on the capitals in the cloister at Silos, knights are shown bestriding goats.Now, goats are symbolic of superiority, because of their association with highpeaks, and Rabanus Maurus points out that knights mounted on goats must"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"KNIGHT170therefore be interpreted as saints (46). Of course, the purpose of the assimilationof saint with knight is to magnify the symbolic worth of the knight, as in the caseof St. Ignatius Loyola.

This knight-symbolism isKnight Errant, after an early 16th-century engraving."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"KNIGHT171common in all symbolic traditions. Ananda Coomaraswamy observes that ‘the“horse” is a symbol of the bodily vehicle, and the “rider” is the Spirit: when thelatter has come to the end of its incarnations, the saddle is unoccupied, and thevehicle necessarily dies’ (60). By taking account of certain other orders of thingsanalogous with chivalry, including (particularly) alchemy (which was in fact amediaeval technique of spiritualization) and also certain aspects of colour-sym-bolism, we have been able to arrive at a system of analogies which we believe tobe very helpful in explaining some of the more recondite aspects of the symbol-ism of knighthood. Mediaeval tales and legends often refer to a green, white or redknight, but most frequently of all to a black knight. Should we regard this asmerely a matter of aesthetic appreciation of the colour in a literal and decorativesense? Or does the choice of colour proceed necessarily from a highly significantcause? The latter, we think. In alchemy, the rising scale of colours (the progres-sive, evolutive scale) is: black, white, red (corresponding to prime matter, mer-cury, sulphur), with gold representing the hypothetical, final stage. Conversely, itcan be said that the descending scale would be from blue to green, that is, descend-ing from heaven to earth. These two colours stand for the celestial, and the naturalor terrestrial factors. Furthermore, black is associated with sin, penitence, thewithdrawal of the recluse, the hidden, rebirth in seclusion, and sorrow; white withinnocence (natural as well as that regained through expiation), illumination,openheartedness, gladness; and red with passion (moral or material—love orpain), blood, wounds, sublimation and ecstasy. We may therefore surmise thatthe Green Knight is the pre-knight, the squire, the apprentice sworn to knight-hood; the Black Knight stands for him who undergoes the tribulations of sin,expiation and obscurity in order to attain to immortality by way of earthly gloryand heavenly beatitude; the White Knight (Sir Galahad) is the natural conqueror,the ‘chosen one’ of the Evangelists, or the ‘illuminated one’ reemerging from aperiod of nigredo; the Red Knight is the knight sublimated by every possibletrial, bloodied from every possible sacrifice, supremely virile, the conqueror of allthat is base, who, having completed his life’s work, is fully deserving of gold in itsultimate transmutation—glorification. Knighthood should be seen, then, as asuperior kind of pedagogy helping to bring about the transmutation of naturalman (steedless) into spiritual man. An important part was played in this sym-bolic tradition by prototypes such as the famous, mythical knights of the court ofKing Arthur or patron saints such as St. George, Santiago of Compostela, or thearchangel Michael. The practical means of achieving the knight’s ultimate goalconsisted of corporeal exertions, which were, in effect, not merely physical ormaterial since the knight practised with all kinds of arms, and these arms stoodfor symbolic potentialities; these practical exertions, then, led eventually to theinversion of the world of desire through the ascetic denial of physical pleasure—the very essence of knighthood—and the almost mystic cult of the beloved. The"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"KNOT172knight’s relative shortcomings while carrying out his sworn duties provide theexplanation of the colour black which we have just examined. Nevertheless, otherexplanations have also been advanced, as for example that the knight is the ‘guard-ian of the treasure’, supplanting the monster he has conquered (the serpent ordragon). Clearly this symbolism is not opposed to that which we have proposed,rather does it support it by emphasizing the essential mission of the knight’sservice. Another interesting aspect of knight-symbolism—though, in a way, anegative one—can be seen in the use of the epithets ‘wandering’ and ‘errant’ inmediaeval tales, legends and folklore. At times, the adjective has a precise mean-ing, at other times it is much more imprecise. In every case, the wandering (or‘errantry’) of the knight implies an intermediate position between the ‘saved’knight and the accursed hunter, with the difference that the knight errant, so farfrom being caught up in the pursuit of his desires, is of course striving to masterthem—and this is what we had in mind when we observed that this aspect ‘in away, is a negative one’. Needless to say, this symbolism of one who takes thedark and lonely path of expiation, verifies our observation that the Black Knightis a symbol of withdrawal, penitence and sacrifice.Knot A complex symbol embracing several important meanings all of whichare related to the central idea of a tightly closed link. It implies also the symbolismof the spiral and the sigmoid line (41). The sign for infinity—the horizontal figure8—as well as the number 8 itself, are at once interlacing and also knotted, and thisemphasizes the relationship of the knot with the idea of infinity—or, rather, withthe manifestation of the infinite. It is comparable with the net, the loop and theplait, in that it expresses the concept of binding and fettering—a concept whichis generally expressive of an unchanging psychic situation, however unaware ofhis predicament the individual may be: for example, that of the unliberated manwho is ‘tied down’ by the Uranian god. This is why the Flamen Dialis of theancient Romans could not wear knots in his habits; and this is also true of theMoslems on their pilgrimages to Mecca (21). These magic associations of bind-ing, which form part of the symbolism of the knot, are sometimes given literalexpression in magical practices, such as those of fishermen in the Shetland IslandsHeraldic knot."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"LABYRINTH173who still believe that they can control the winds by the magic use of knots (21).A knotted cord forms a kind of closed ring, or a circumference, and hence itpossesses the general significance of an enclosure, and of protection. The ‘slip-knot’ is a determinative sign in the Egyptian language, entering into the composi-tion of words such as calumny, oaths, or a journey. The meaning must haveoriginated in the idea of keeping in touch with someone who is far away, and thereis unquestionably some connexion with the enigma of the Hanged Man in theTarot pack (19). The ‘endless knot’ is one of the eight Emblems of Good Luck ofChinese Buddhism, representing longevity (5); the symbolism here has taken oneaspect of the concept of the knot—that of pure connexion—and applied it to thebiological and phenomenal planes. Finally, the famous ‘Gordian knot’ cut byAlexander the Great, by virtue of his determination and his sword, is a long-standing symbol of the labyrinth, arising out of the chaotic and inextricable tangleof the cords with which it was tied. To undo the knot was equivalent to findingthe ‘Centre’ which forms such an important part of all mystic thought. And to cutthe knot was to transfer the pure idea of achievement and victory to the plane ofwar and of existence.LLabyrinth An architectonic structure, apparently aimless, and of a patternso complex that, once inside, it is impossible or very difficult to escape. Or it maytake the form of a garden similarly patterned. Ancient writings mention five greatmazes: that of Egypt, which Pliny located in lake Moeris; the two Cretan laby-rinths of Cnossus (or Gnossus) and Gortyna; the Greek maze on the island ofLemnos; and the Etruscan at Clusium. It is likely that certain initiatory templeswere labyrinthine in construction for doctrinal reasons. Ground-plans, sketchesand emblems of mazes appear fairly frequently over a very wide area, but princi-pally in Asia and Europe. Some are believed to have been conceived with thepurpose of luring devils into them so that they might never escape. It is to besupposed, therefore, that, for the Primitive, the maze had a certain fascinationcomparable with the abyss, the whirlpool and other phenomena (8). Neverthe-less, Waldemar Fenn suggests that some circular or elliptical labyrinths in prehis-toric engravings—those at Peña de Mogor, for example—should be interpreted asdiagrams of heaven, that is, as images of the apparent motions of the astral bodies."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"LABYRINTH174This notion is not opposed to the previous one: it is independent of it and, up toa point, complementary, because the terrestrial maze, as a structure or a pattern,is capable of reproducing the celestial, and because both allude to the same basicidea—the loss of the spirit in the process of creation—that is, the ‘fall’ in theneoplatonic sense—and the consequent need to seek out the way through the‘Centre’, back to the spirit. There is an illustration in De Groene Leeuw, byGoosse van Wreeswyk (Amsterdam, 1672), which depicts the sanctuary of thealchemists’ lapis, encircled by the orbits of the planets, as walls, suggesting in thisway a cosmic labyrinth (32). The emblem of the labyrinth was widely used byLabyrinth—the clock implies juxtaposition of time and space. (After an old engraving.)"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"LAKE175mediaeval architects. To trace through the labyrinthic path of a mosaic patternedon the ground was once considered a symbolic substitute for a pilgrimage to theHoly Land (28). Some labyrinths shaped like a cross, known in Italy as ‘Solomon’sknot’, and featured in Celtic, Germanic and Romanesque decoration, are a synthe-sis of the dual symbolism of the cross and the labyrinth; they are known, for thisreason, as the ‘emblem of divine inscrutability’. It is not difficult to make out, inthe centre of the pattern, the figure of the swastika, which adds to the basicsymbolism a suggestion of rotating, generating and unifying motion (4). For Diel,the maze signifies the unconscious, and also error and remoteness from the fountof life (15). Eliade notes that the essential mission of the maze was to defend the‘Centre’—that it was, in fact, an initiation into sanctity, immortality and absolutereality and, as such, equivalent to other ‘trials’ such as the fight with the dragon.At the same time, the labyrinth may be interpreted as an apprenticeship for theneophyte who would learn to distinguish the proper path leading to the Land ofthe Dead (17).Lake In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, the schematic figure of a lakeexpresses the occult and the mysterious, probably by allusion to the undergroundlake which the sun has to pass over during its ‘night-crossing’ (but also simply byassociating it with the symbolism of level, given that water always alludes to the‘connexion between the superficial and the profound’; a lake becomes, then, afluid mass of transparency). In the temple of the god Amon, at Karnak, there wasan artificial lake symbolizing hyle—or the ‘lower waters’ of protomatter. And, atcertain times during the year, a procession of priests would cross the lake inboats, in this way re-enacting the ‘night-crossing’ of the sun mentioned above(19). The symbolism here is the same, broadly speaking, as that of the waterydeeps. The Irish and Breton belief that the Land of the Dead is at the bottom ofthe ocean or of lakes may be derived from watching the sun setting over the water;and the death of human beings, and therefore by analogy the setting of the sun,was interpreted as passing over into the nether world. But, as we have suggested,the structure of lake-symbolism may have arisen directly out of the symbolism oflevel; for this latter symbolism, so deeply rooted in the psyche of man, equates allthat is on a low level spatially with what is low in a spiritual, negative, destruc-tive, and hence fatal, sense. The fact that water-symbolism is closely connectedwith the symbolism of the abyss serves to corroborate the fatal implications ofthe lake-symbol, for the part played by the liquid Element is to provide thetransition between life and death, between the solid and the gaseous, the formaland the informal. At the same time, the lake—or, rather, its surface alone—holdsthe significance of a mirror, presenting an image of self-contemplation, conscious-ness and revelation."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"LAMB      176Lamb The origins of the symbolism of the lamb are to be found in the Bookof Enoch (32). It signifies purity, innocence, meekness (as well as unwarrantedsacrifice). In allegories, it lies at the root of representations of either pure thought,or a just man, or the Lamb of God (4). Pinedo, however, points to the interestingrelationship between the lamb and the lion, by inversion of their respectivesymbolic meanings. Examples of this are common in Christian symbolism, espe-cially during the Romanesque period; a good instance is that of a tympanum in thechurch at Armentia, where the Agnus Dei is shown inside a circle (symbolizingthe All, or perfection) accompanied by the epigraph: ‘Mors ego sum mortis.Vocor Agnus, sum Leo fortis’ (I am the death of death. I am called a lamb, I am astrong lion) (46) (Plate XX). Its etymology suggests other symbolic meanings:Alleau, in De la Nature des symboles (Paris, 1958), proposes that agnus is relatedto the Greek agnos and therefore symbolizes the unknown; and that it is alsorelated to agni (fire) and so is a sacrificial symbol of the periodic renovation of theworld.Lamia The mythic queen Lamia, celebrated for her beauty, was turned intoa wild beast because of her cruelty. Ancient writings refer to lamias, in the plural,as beings similar to sirens, found in the company of dragons in caves and deserts.In 1577, Johann Wier published an entire treatise upon these beings, entitled DeLamiis Liber. According to Caro Baroja, this belief in lamias still persists inGascony. Their attribute is the gold comb—a fish skeleton perhaps?—with whichthey comb their hair (10). Legend has it that lamias are devourers of children (8).Jung has pointed out that the fact that ‘lamia’ is also the word used for a huge andvery voracious fish (from ‘lamos’—an abyss) verifies the connexion between thedevouring lamias and the dragon-whale of the kind studied by Frobenius in Zeitalterdes Sonnengottes (31).Lamp A symbol of intelligence and the spirit (56). It appears in this sense inthe Greek myth of Psyche, in the legend of Diogenes and in the hermit (the ninthenigma) of the Tarot pack (40). The lamps of the ancients were shaped accordingto their function—profane, religious or funereal—and to suit the nature of the godto whom they were dedicated. There were lamps with twelve wicks, symbolizingthe Wheel of the Zodiac. And there were perpetually burning lamps such as thatkept alight by the vestal virgins, or that of the temple of Venus noted by St.Augustine (8).Lance A symbol of war, and also a phallic symbol (8). It is a weapon ofearthly character, in contrast to the celestial implications of the sword. It isconnected with the symbolism of the cup or chalice. Generally speaking, thelance is comparable from the symbological point of view with the branch, the"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"LANDSCAPE177tree, the cross, and all symbols pertaining to the valley-mountain axis. In theLibro del orden de caballería, Raymond Lull expresses the belief that the lance isgiven to a knight as a symbol of rectitude. The ‘bleeding lance’, which appears inthe legend of the Grail, has sometimes been interpreted as the lance of Longinus,relating it to that of the Passion. There are authors who reject this interpretationand see it rather as a general sacrificial symbol.Landscape Logically speaking it may be deduced that the countryside—landscapes of all kinds—is the mundane manifestation of a dynamic complexwhich in origin was non-spatial. Inner forces are liberated to unfold as formswhich disclose in themselves the qualitative and quantitative order of their innertensions. Thus a mountain crest becomes a graphic sign. Let us take, by way ofillustration, landscapes as they appear in dreams. Leaving aside the phenomenonof memory, reminiscence, or the complex association of various sense-data, thescenes and towns which figure in dreams are neither arbitrary and indeterminatenor objective: they are symbolic—that is, they well up in order to illuminatecertain momentary experiences called forth by varying combinations of influ-ences in varying degrees of intensity. Landscape-scenes arising in the imaginationin this way are sustained solely by the validity, duration and intensity of thefeelings which aroused them. Form—just as in physical morphology—is thediagram of force. Now, what we have said about landscapes in dreams can beapplied also to an actual landscape, seen and selected by an automatic response ofthe unconscious, which detects in it an affinity that gives us pause and makes usreturn to it again and again. This, then, is a question not of a projection of the mindbut of an analogy whereby the landscape is adopted by the spirit in consequenceof the inner bond linking the character of the scene with the spirit of the observerhimself. Subjectivism concerns only the act of choosing. The intellection of thesignificance of a landscape is, then, wholly objective, as is the grasping of thesymbolic values of colours and numbers. The Chinese saw this with the utmostclarity: as Luc Benoist has observed, Chinese art has always placed more empha-sis upon landscape than upon man (as a figure, that is to say), and upon themacrocosm rather than the microcosm. ‘If the superior man loves the country-side,’ to quote the words of Kuo Hsi, ‘why is this so? Hills and gardens willalways be the haunts of him who seeks to cultivate his original nature; fountainsand rocks are a constant joy to him who wanders whistling among them. . .’ (6).It is a well-established tradition of symbology that the different worlds (or zones)are strictly only different states of being. Hence the fact that the ‘chosen site’ isthe enshrining image which arises out of it. The ‘trysting place’, when it trulypossesses that character, and is not merely arbitrary or fortuitous, signifies ameeting or ‘conjoining’ in precisely this same sense—that is, transposed into"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"LANDSCAPE178topographical or spatial terms (26). However revolutionary these assertions mayseem, they are nevertheless confirmed by the findings of the psychology of formand by isomorphism, since it has been shown that it is not possible to distinguishbetween psychic and physical formal processes—other than externally. In sup-port of all this, there is the comment of Mircea Eliade that ‘In point of fact, mannever chooses a site, he simply “discovers it”. . . . One of the means of discoveringone’s situation is by orientation’ (17). Now, in order to grasp the symbolic senseof a landscape it is necessary to distinguish between the predominant elementsand the merely incidental, and between the character of the whole and the charac-ter of the component elements. When the predominant element is a cosmic one,its effect is to bind all the other components together, and it is this cosmicingredient which makes its influence felt over and above that of the individualfeatures of the landscape. Instances of such cosmic features are the sea, thedesert, the icy wastes, the mountain-peak, clouds and sky. It is when the ingredi-ents of landscape-symbolism are varied and evenly balanced that symbolic inter-pretation is most needed. The interpreter must, then, look for the following: (a)a spatial pattern organized within particular limits which endow it with a struc-ture after the manner of a building or a work of art. By spatial symbolism wemean, in the first place, the symbolism of level, that is, the disposition of thezones of the landscape according to the three levels of the normal, the lower andthe higher; and secondly the symbolism of orientation, that is, the position of theaccidental elements in relation to the north-south and the east-west axes. He mustthen bear in mind (b) the form—the pattern or the shape of the terrain, whetherit is undulating or broken, steeply sloped or flat, soft or hard; (c) the positionalrelationship of the particular area chosen to the region as a whole or to the zonesurrounding it—whether it is lower or higher, more open or more enclosed; andfinally (d) the natural and artificial elements which make up the organized pat-tern: trees, shrubs, plants, lakes, springs, wells, rocks, sandy shores, houses,steps, benches, grottoes, gardens, fences, doors and gates. Also important is thepredominating colour, or the clash of colours, or the general feeling of fecundity orbarrenness, of brightness or gloom, of order or disorder. Roads and cross-roadsare of great significance, and so are streams. About the objective meaning of eachof the factors we have listed above there is much that we could say; however,since the more important factors—such as the symbolism of level—are dealtwith under separate headings, we will here add no more than a few notes. Steep-ness indicates primitiveness and regression; flat country denotes the apocalypticend, the longing for power and for death. There is a Persian tradition that, whenthe end of the world has come—when Ahriman is vanquished for ever, the moun-tains will be levelled and all the earth will become one great plain. Ideas cognate"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"LANDSCAPE179with this are to be found in certain traditions of Israel and France (35). It wouldnot be hard to point to the history of architecture and town-planning as evidenceof the subconscious application of these principles. Furthermore, there are someaspects of landscapes which have a symbolic air about them that is very difficultto analyse intellectually. For instance, the following descriptive passage fromDante’s Commedia has always seemed to us to evoke an atmosphere of profoundmystery: ‘Around this little island, in its lowest reaches, there, where it is lashedby the waves, reeds grow in the soft mud’ (Purgatorio I, 100). Independent of thecosmic significance of landscape, there may also be a sexual implication. It is alsoessential to bear in mind that this is not strictly a matter of symbols as such butof complex, symbolic functions. For instance, in scenes depicting low-lying to-pographical features, the following factors may be at work: (a) depth in the senseof what is base, comparable therefore with the wicked and infernal; (b) depth inthe sense of what is symbolically profound; (c) depth as it pertains to the mate-rial earth itself, implying a chthonian and maternal symbolism. Only the contextcan help us to tell the essence from the accessory—as is true also of the vastmajority of symbols. Here we must bear in mind the primitive concept of thearchetypal ‘ideal countryside’. Schneider has observed that the fact of there beingso many identical names for rivers and mountains in different parts of the world,suggests that megalithic ways of thought must have led to the custom of namingthe topographical features of different regions after some ideal model. This model,it may be argued, could be the product of the lasting impression made upon themind of Primitive Man by a particular environment endowed with such unity andvariety as to prevent him from ever wishing to leave it; but it could also beexplained as the projection of a psychic order founded upon laws comparablewith those governing quaternary patterns, or the mandala, etc. Man’s attentionwas first drawn to the contraposition of heaven and earth by topographicalfeatures, and he gave expression to this in the struggle between gods and Titans,angels and demons, and in the opposition of mountain and valley. Next, he set outto explain the earth’s surface by means of the laws of orientation, taking the fourpoints of the compass from the apparent orbit of the sun as well as from thehuman anatomy, and identifying them as ambivalent forces—ambivalent becausethey are at once hostile to things external and the defenders of their limits. AsSchneider adds: ‘To preserve cosmic order, the gods fought with the giants andthe monsters which had from the very beginning of creation sought to devour thesun. They stationed the heroic lion on the celestial mountain. Four archers’—thetetramorphs—’are continuously on guard day and night against anyone whoattempts to disrupt the order of the cosmos’ (50).

They owe their origins to the same basic, primordialidea of the symbolism of landscape—its representation of cosmic order. Themountain with one peak is symbolic of the One—of transcendent purpose; thetwo-peaked Mountain of Mars stands for the Gemini, the world of appearancesand the dualism of all forms of life. Both these symbolic mountains find theirsymbolic complement in the general pattern of archetypal landscape—also, inci-dentally, an image of the year; this pattern is composed of the river of life (denot-ing the positive phase) and the river of oblivion (the negative phase) which flowthrough the sea of flames (expressing infirmity) and well up from a single source(birth or the Origin). According to this scheme, every landscape has a disastrousand a felicitous tendency, corresponding on the temporal plane with the self-evident distinction between ‘coming’ and ‘going’ which in turn is analogous to thetwo halves of human existence. But, quite apart from all this, the symbolicinterpretation of a landscape may be determined according to the laws governingdiverse and individual correspondences, as well as the overall significance derivedfrom the complex of meanings afforded by its separate features. By way of anillustration of the many possibilities of interpreting the significance of a land-scape, we will conclude with some comments on Vallcarca with its characteristiclow-lying features. The gardens are at a lower level than the city proper, andscreened from it by the vegetation, which has something of the archaic and orien-tal about it. The main street leads north towards an open plain, signifying theprocess of disintegration. On the other hand, those streets which lead towards themountain are on the favourable axis. In this case, the interpretation is obviousenough, as it is in all instances of scenes where it is possible to identify theessential features of archetypal landscape.Lantern Like all ‘lights’ that are independent of the Light—that which, inother words, is severed—the lantern symbolizes individual life in the face ofcosmic existence, transitory fact in the face of eternal truth, ‘distraction’ in theface of essence. This explains the magic use of lanterns. Because of its psycho-logical interest, we quote here a passage taken from a Chinese work of the Tangdynasty: ‘On the mid-Autumn feast-day, the devil turned himself into a man,ingratiated himself with women and children and led them off to secret placeswhence they could not escape (a death-symbol). Seeing that this demon wasgreatly persecuting the people, the jurisconsult Bao-Cong informed the king ofthe matter and persuaded him to issue a decree to the effect that paper lanterns,shaped like fishes, should be hung at the entrances of the houses. In this fashionwould the carp-demon, deceived by these images, leave the Hundred Families inpeace’ (13)."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"LEO181Laurel A tree sacred to Apollo and expressive of victory. Laurel leaves wereused to weave festive garlands and crowns. The crowning of the poet, the artist orconqueror with laurel leaves was meant to represent not the external and visibleconsecration of an act, but the recognition that that act, by its very existence,presupposes a series of inner victories over the negative and dissipative influenceof the base forces. There is no achievement without struggle and triumph. Hencethe laurel expresses, the progressive identification of the hero with the motivesand aims of his victory.

The alchemists employed the image ofa white dove contained in lead to express their central idea that matter was thereceptacle of the spirit (32). The specific symbolism of lead is the transference ofthe idea of weight and density on to the spiritual plane.Leaf One of the eight ‘common emblems’ of Chinese symbolism, it is anallegory of happiness.

The leg is also equivalent to the pedestal, andin Cabbalistic thought it denotes qualities of firmness and splendour.Lemures The Romans gave this name to disembodied spirits.

Enel, in La Langue sacrée, has subjected the Egyptianalphabet to a profound and scrupulous study, selecting those that have a phoneticvalue from the vast repertory of syllabic and ideographic signs. He recalls thatHorapollo Niliacus in antiquity, and Kircher and Valeriano in the Renaissance,tried unsuccessfully to analyse the meaning of these symbolic signs; it is only thework of Champollion, Maspero, Mariette, etc., which has made a true under-standing possible. The significance of many Egyptian signs can best be under-stood by grasping the import of the so-called ‘determinative’ signs, governinggroups of phonetic signs. We cannot here give any idea of this complex Egyptiansystem, which was a mixture of ideographic signs and phonetic signs, abstractallusions and concrete pictograms in the form of visual patterns, such as the signfor combat (two arms holding an axe and a shield) or figures denoting geographicalplaces (Lower Egypt was represented by plants characteristic of the Delta). Wemust limit ourselves, then, to the so-called Egyptian alphabet, which Enel seesclosely linked, in its development, with the idea of creation itself. Here is hisexplanation: ‘Thus the divine principle, the essence of life and the reason forcreation, is represented by the eagle, but, within the microcosm, this same signexpresses reason—the faculty which brings Man into proximity with the godhead,raising him above all other created beings.

But the development of thecreative forces of the macrocosmos, like that of human labour, is subject to thelaw of equilibrium (expressed by a semicircle based upon its diameter). There aretwo aspects to this equilibrium: (1) the swing of the needle of the scales through180 degrees, and (2) the daily trajectory of the sun across the sky from East toWest—the alpha and omega of St. John—represented by the bird of day (theeagle) and the night-bird (the owl), and corresponding respectively to life anddeath, dawn and sunset. . . . The connexion between the two opposite poles ofthese constant alternations is symbolized by the distinction between the “upperwaters” and the “lower waters”, and represented by a sign which is equivalent tothe Hebrew mem.

The forces which animate every manifes-tation of life are the dual streams of the evolutive/involutive principle, or descentand ascent, represented by the leg as a sign of upward movement.

For example, theletter aleph denotes will-power, man, the magician; beth, science, the mouth, thetemple door; ghimel, action, the grasping hand; etc. (48).

But this is really a case ofthe fusing of true symbolism with purely conventional connotations—althoughthe significance of the letter M is symbolic in the true sense.

The seven letters also corre-sponded to the seven Directions of space (that is, the six extremities of the three-dimensional cross plus the centre) (39).Among the Arabs, too, letters had a numerical value: the number of the lettersin the alphabet was twenty-eight, like the days of the lunar month. Given theimportance traditionally attached to the word—the Element of air—it is easy tounderstand why Man, in every system ever formulated, has always tried toprove the divine power of letters by making them dependent upon mystic andcosmic orders. Saint-Yves d’Alveydre, in L’Archéometre (1911), has made abroad study of letter-symbolism, although, in our opinion, he comes to some-what arbitrary conclusions concerning the relationship between the alphabet,colour, sound, planets, the signs of the Zodiac, virtue, the element of nature, andso on. As an example, here is what he says about the letter M: ‘It corresponds tothe natural Origin, which gives rise to all temporal forms of existence. Its numberis 40. Its colour, sea-green; its sign, Scorpio; its planet, Mars; its musical note,Re.’ Of greater symbolic authenticity is the summary which Bayley makes,drawing upon a variety of sources of information to arrive at a synthesis of theintrinsic significance of the letters which now comprise our Western alphabet.Clearly, there are some letter-symbols of more obvious meaning than others. Hereare some of the less obvious suggested by Bayley: A is related to the cone, themountain, the pyramid, the first cause; B, (?); C, the crescent moon, the sea, theMagna Mater; D, the brilliant, the diamond, the day; E is a solar letter; F signifiesthe fire of life; G, the Creator; H, Gemini, the threshold; I, number one, the axis ofthe universe; L, power; M and N, the waves of the sea and the undulations of thesnake; O is a solar disk, denoting perfection; P, R, the shepherd’s crook, the staff;S, the snake or serpent; T, the hammer, the double-headed axe, the cross; U, thechain of Jupiter; V, a receptacle, convergence, twin radii; X, the cross of light, theunion of the two worlds—the superior and the inferior; Y, three in one, the cross-"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"LEVEL185ways; and Z, the zigzag of lightning (4). As an interesting sidelight, here areBayley’s conclusions concerning the ideas—merely conventional in this instance—related to initials most commonly figuring in mediaeval and 16th-century em-blems: A (combined with V) signifies Ave; M is the initial letter of the VirginMary, and also a sign of the Millennium, that is, of the end of this world; R standsfor Regeneratio or Redemptio; Z for Zion; S for Spiritus; SS for Sanctus Spiritus;T for Theos, etc.Any study of letter-symbolism must be closely related to the examination ofwords. Loeffler recalls that, among the Aryans and also among the Semites, M hasalways been the initial letter of words related to water and to birth of beings andthe worlds (Mantras, Manu, Maya, Madhava, Mahat, etc.) (38). Concerning theconnexion between M and N, we believe that the latter is the antithesis of theformer, that is: if M corresponds to the regenerating aspect of water, N pertainsto its destructive side, or to the annihilation of forms. Letters, because of theirassociations, were one of the techniques used by the Cabbalists.We cannot here do more than mention the study of the ‘tifinars’; or prehis-toric symbolic signs, made by R. M. Gattefossé in Les Sages Ecritures (Lyon,1945). Also very interesting is the philosophy of letters—and of grammar—intheir symbolic context worked out by M. Court de Gebelin in his Du Génieallégorique et symbolique de l’antiquité (Paris, 1777). Basing his study upon aprimitive tongue, he draws conclusions concerning the mental attitudes whichinspired the symbolism of proper names, linguistic roots, sacred fables, cos-mogonies, symbolic pictures, escutcheons, hieroglyphs, etc., as well as of letters.For example, A, he suggests, can be: a cry, a verb, a preposition, an article, aninitial letter—apart from its character in oriental tongues, etc. For a profoundanalysis of the Cabbalistic significance of the symbolism of letters, the work ofKnorr de Rosenroth, Le Symbolisme des lettres hébraïques . . . selon la KabbalaDenudata (Paris, 1958), may be consulted. An important general review of thesymbolism of letters and graphic signs is given by Alfred Kallir in his book, Signand Design (London, 1961).Level This is a term which refers to that aspect of the symbolism of spacewhich is concerned with the simple moral pattern deriving from the notions ofheight and—ultimately—of centre. Hindu doctrine describes the three fundamen-tal states of the human spirit as sattva, which is ‘loftiness’ of spirit; rajas—manifestation, struggle and dynamism; and tamas, or obscurity and brute in-stinct; and these three states are located on three vertical levels. Strictly speaking,there are five zones or levels: the absolute low level and the absolute high level,plus the central area divided into three zones merging into each other and at the"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"LEVIATHAN186same time bringing the outer extremes into progressive relationship. When thebaser levels concern not the intellectual but the moral—which is in essence infi-nitely more complex and mysterious—then the precise significance of the sym-bolism is not nearly so hard-and-fast. There is always the possibility of symbolicInversion, in which case the two opposing directions have something in commonin that both partake of the idea of depth. Hence the saying: ‘Deep calls to deep.’The temptations endured by the chosen few find their counterpart in the abyssesof salvation which may be opened up for the reprobate. Dostoievski has spokeneloquently about this. Finally, here is a quotation from L’Art chinois by M.Paléologue, written in 1888: ‘Under the Chinese Chou dynasty (11th centuryB.C.), the dead of the lower classes were buried in the plains; princes, on hills ofmoderate height; and emperors in tombs built on a mountain-top. The head of thecorpse would be turned to face North.’ In virtually every work of art whosecomposition is of an ideological rather than a naturalistic character, the vertical-line locates the Three Worlds of the infernal, terrestrial (with its own, internalorders—the marine, the animal and the human) and celestial. Thus, in theMesopotamian stele (or Kudurru), the illustrations are arranged on several levels,divided off by lines to suggest their relative values: the most primitive beings areplaced at the lowest level (since they are closest to the ‘primordial monster’)while astral bodies and symbols of the godhead are situated on the highest plane.The same principles are true of Romanesque art.Leviathan A huge, fabulous fish which bears the weight of the waters uponits back and which the Rabbis claimed was destined for the Supper of the Mes-siah (8). In Scandinavian mythology, the oceans are the creation of a great serpentor dragon which swallows the waters only to regurgitate them; this being is calledMidgardorm (35). The Leviathan is an archetype of things inferior—of the pri-mordial monster connected with the cosmogonic sacrifice, such as theMesopotamian Tiamat (or Tiawath). Sometimes it is in all respects identical withthe world—or, rather, with the force which preserves and vitalizes the world.Liberation of the Damsel Of mythological origin (Siegfried waking Brunhild,the story of the Sleeping Beauty), it appears in pagan and Christian legends, andin books of knight-errantry. Perseus liberating Andromeda is possibly the arche-type, though we must not forget St. George and the princess. In the ‘matière deBretagne’, there are numerous instances of knights liberating damsels, and thiscould almost be regarded as their essential mission. As a symbol of the search forthe anima and its liberation from the subjugation in which it is held by malign andinferior powers, it seems to be of mystical origin."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"LIGHT187Libra The seventh sign of the Zodiac, Libra, is, like the cross and the sword,related to the symbolism of the number seven, and the sign for equilibrium, onboth the cosmic and the psychic planes, and concerning both social and inwardlegality and justice. It is said, therefore, that the balance or scales designates theequilibrium between the solar world and planetary manifestation, or between thespiritual ego of Man (the Selbst of Jungian psychology) and the external ego (orthe personality). It likewise indicates the equilibrium between good and evil; for,like Man, the scales has two tendencies, symbolized by the two symmetricallydisposed pans, one tending towards the Scorpion (denoting the world of desires)and the other towards the sign of Virgo (sublimation). Man must, after the modelof the scales, balance out his inner tendencies. According to traditional astrology,the sign of the balance rules the kidneys. The seventh sign pertains to humanrelations and to the union of the spirit within itself, that is to say, to spiritual andmental health. As an allegory of justice, it refers to the intimate and moderatinginfluence of self-chastisement (40). As a symbol of inner harmony and of inter-communication between the left side (the unconscious, or matter) and the right(the consciousness or spirit), it represents ‘Conjunction’ (Plate XXI).Life All things that flow and grow were regarded in early religions as a symbolof life: fire represented the vital craving for nourishment, water was chosen for itsfertilizing powers, plants because of their verdure in spring-time. Now, all—orvery nearly all—symbols of life are also symbolic of death. Media vita in mortesumus, observed the mediaeval monk, to which modern science has replied La viec’est la mort (Claude Bernard). Thus, fire is the destroyer, while water in itsvarious forms signifies dissolution, as suggested in the Psalms. In legend andfolklore, the Origin of life—or the source of the renewal of the life forces—takesthe form of caves and caverns where wondrous torrents and springs well up (38).Light Light, traditionally, is equated with the spirit (9). Ely Star asserts thatthe superiority of the spirit is immediately recognizable by its luminous inten-sity. Light is the manifestation of morality, of the intellect and the seven virtues(54). Its whiteness alludes to just such a synthesis of the All. Light of any givencolour possesses a symbolism corresponding to that colour, plus the significanceof emanation from the ‘Centre’, for light is also the creative force, cosmic energy,Zodiacal sign of Libra."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"LIGHTNESS188irradiation (57). Symbolically, illumination comes from the East. Psychologicallyspeaking, to become illuminated is to become aware of a source of light, and, inconsequence, of spiritual strength (32).Lightness The sonorous, the transparent and the mobile constitute a trilogywhich is related to the sensation of lightness within (3). Air is the Element whichcorresponds primarily to this sensation. From the oneirocritic and literary pointsof view, the desire for lightness is depicted by the symbol of the dance—as inNietzsche—rather than by flight. If the latter is in essence expressive of the willto rise above oneself and above others, the former concerns the urge to escape.Lilith Lilith, in Hebrew legend, was the first wife of Adam. She was a night-phantom and the enemy of childbirth and of the newborn. In mythic tradition shewas regarded as a satellite invisible from the earth (8). In Israelite tradition, shecorresponds to the Greek and Roman Lamia. She may also be equated withBrunhild in the saga of the Niebelungen, in opposition to Kriemhild (or Grimhild,or Eve). She is symbolic of the Terrible Mother. All these characteristics relate herclosely to the Greek figure of Hecate, with her demands for human sacrifice. Lilithpersonifies the maternal imago in so far as she denotes the vengeful mother whoreappears in order to harry the son and his wife (a theme which, in some respects,is transferred to the Stepmother and to the Mother-in-Law). Lilith is not to berelated literally to the Mother, but with the idea of the mother venerated (that is,loved and feared) during childhood. Sometimes she also takes the form of thedespised mistress, or the ‘long forgotten’ mistress, as in the case of Brunhildmentioned above, or of the temptress who, in the name of the maternal imago,seeks and brings about the destruction of the son and his wife. There is a certainquality of the virile about her, as there is about Hecate, the ‘accursed huntress’.The overcoming of the threat which Lilith constitutes finds its symbolic expres-sion in the trial of Hercules in which he triumphs over the Amazons.Lily An emblem of purity, used in Christian—and particularly mediaeval—iconography as a symbol and attribute of the Virgin Mary (46).

Félix de Rosnay, in Le Chrisme, les lys et le symbolisme de Paray(Lyon, 1900), points to the connexion between the fleur-de-lis, in respect of thesymbolism of its form, and the chrism or cross of St. Andrew intersected by therho, and the ancient cross of the Aeduan Gauls (a cross with a vertical line tracedthrough the centre), which is quite clearly a symbol of inversion; it was worn onthe sword-guard. The lily, in Byzantium and among the Christianized Franks,was a sign of royalty.Lingam The lingam is not just a sign for the phallus, but for the integrationof both sexes, symbolizing the generating power of the universe (8). It is verycommonly found in Hindu temples. A comparable symbol is that of the Tree ofLife of the Persians whose seeds when mixed with water preserve the fertility ofthe earth (31). All symbols of ‘conjunction’ of this kind allude to the hierosgamos, without which the continuous process of creation and preservation of theuniverse would be inconceivable; hence they find their way into fecundity andfertility rites. In China, the lingam is called Kuei; it is an oblong piece of jadeterminating in a triangle. The seven stars of the Great Bear are often engraved onthe Kuei (39), probably symbolizing space and time (that is, the Seven Directionsand the seven days of the week).Lion The lion corresponds principally to gold or the ‘subterranean sun’, andto the sun itself, and hence it is found as a symbol of sun-gods such as Mithras.In Egypt, it used to be believed that the lion presided over the annual floods of theNile, because they coincided with the entry of the sun into the zodiacal sign ofLeo during the dog-days.

Inalchemy, it corresponds to the ‘fixed’ element—to sulphur. When counter-bal-anced by three other animals, it represents earth (although elsewhere it has beensaid that it stands for ‘philosophical fire’) (57), while gold is given the name of‘lion of metals’; the red-coloured lion is more strictly applicable to the latter (56).But, apart from these considerations, which lie more in the province of the theoryof correspondences than in symbology proper, the lion, the ‘king of beasts’,symbolizes the earthly opponent of the eagle in the sky and the ‘natural lord andmaster’—or the possessor of strength and of the masculine principle. As Frobeniusnotes, the motif of the solar lion which tears out the throat of the lunar bull isrepeated interminably in Asiatic and African ornamentation (22). According toSchneider, the lion pertains to the Element of earth and the winged lion to theElement of fire. Both are symbolic of continual struggle, solar light, morning, regaldignity and victory. As a symbol of the Evangelists, the lion came to be associatedwith St. Mark in particular. Naturally, other meanings may be derived from thelocation or the context in which the lion appears. The young lion corresponds tothe rising sun, the old or infirm lion to the setting sun. The lion victorious repre-sents the exaltation of virility; the lion tamed carries, on the symbolic plane, theobvious significance which it has in real life (50). For Jung, the lion, in its wildstate, is broadly speaking an index of latent passions; it may also take the form ofa sign indicating the danger of being devoured by the unconscious (32). But thislatter sense goes beyond lion-symbolism as such, being related to the generalsymbolism of devouring (which in turn is related to the symbolism of time). Thewild lioness is a symbol of the Magna Mater (35).Loaves of Bread As with grains of corn, loaves are symbols of fecundity andperpetuation, which is why they sometimes take on forms that are sexual inimplication.Locusts In Christian symbolism, locusts represent the forces of destruction(20), a symbolism which can be traced back to the Hebrew tradition of the‘plagues of Pharaoh’. To quote the words of the Bible (Revelation ix, 1-10): ‘Andthe fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to himwas given the key of the bottomless pit. And he opened the bottomless pit; andthere arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun andthe air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. And there came out of thesmoke locusts upon the earth; and unto them was given power, as the scorpionsof the earth have power.

And in thosedays shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and deathshall flee from them. And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses preparedunto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faceswere as the faces of men. And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teethwere as the teeth of lions. And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates ofiron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horsesrunning to battle. And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings intheir tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.’Logos The Logos is the light and the life, at once spiritual and material, whichcombats both death and night (7). It is the antithesis of disorder and chaos, of eviland darkness. It is also cognate with the word and with thought.Loops and Bonds In mythology and iconography, the symbolism of loopsand knots has an endless number of variants, both as images of connexion and asforms of ornamental art, appearing as plaited links, rosettes, knots or ties, rib-bons, cords or string, ligaments, nets and whips. In the broadest sense, loops andknots represent the idea of binding. It would seem that, if modern man—accord-ing to the ‘existentialist’ approach—feels himself to be ‘thrown’ into the world,the primitive, oriental and astrobiological man perceived that he was ‘bound’ tothe world, to the creator, to the order and society of which he was part. JurgisBaltrusaitis, in his Etudes sur l’art mediéval en Géorgie et en Arménie, distin-guished the following types of rosette in Romanesque ornamentation: intersect-ing, intertwining, connecting and linking. He comments that intertwining plaitspertain to the most ancient of forms created by man, for they cannot be accounteda product of either barbarian art or of any particular Asiatic influence. Entangledin the knots, nets or cords, very commonly one finds monsters, animals or humanfigures. In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, the loop or tie was a sign corre-sponding to the letter T, and equivalent grammatically to the possessive (such as‘to bind’, ‘to dominate’ or ‘to possess’) (19). A related symbol is that of En-tanglement (q.v.). But there are particular aspects of this symbol which present itin a favourable light: the ‘golden thread’, for example, identical with the ‘silvercord’ in Hindu tradition, and with ‘Ariadne’s thread’, and symbolic of the pathleading to the creator. The mystic sense comes about by inversion: instead of thesymbol representing external bonds, it comes to stand for inner links. The cor-dons which are such a constant feature of heraldry also pertain to these ‘inner"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"LORELEI192links’, sometimes in the form of knots, or of ribbons bunched together to form theletter S or the number 8 (4), representing linkage or dependence in the feudalsystem of hierarchies (ratified in the oath of allegiance), or the sublimation of theidea of being ‘in bondage’ to one’s superior (36). On the other hand, the externalnet which envelops and immobilizes should be related in significance to the wordsof the Bible (quoted by Pinedo): ‘Upon the wicked he shall rain snares’ (Psalmsxi, 6) (46). Mircea Eliade has made a special study of the symbolism of knots andties as they concern the tangle of thread which has to be unravelled in order tosolve the essential basis of a problem. Some gods, such as Varuna or Uranus, areshown holding a length of rope, signifying their prerogative of supreme power.Eliade notes that there is a symbolic relationship between loops and bonds on theone hand and threads and labyrinths on the other. The labyrinth may be regardedas a knot to be untied, as in the mythic undertakings of Theseus and Alexander.The ultimate aim of mankind is to free himself from bonds. The same thing is tobe found in Greek philosophy: in Plato’s ‘cave’, men are fettered and unable tomove (Republic, VII). For Plotinus, the soul ‘after its fall, is imprisoned andfettered . . . but when it turns towards (the realm of) thought, it shakes off itsbonds’ (Enneads IV, 8). Eliade has also studied the morphology of bonds andknots in magic cults, distinguishing two broad divisions: (a) those which arebeneficent and a protection against wild animals, illness and sorcery, and againstdemons and death; (b) those which are employed as a form of ‘attack’ againsthuman enemies—symbolically the inverse of severing ropes or bonds (18). Thislatter practice is carried to the extent of tying up dead bodies to prevent themfrom performing the injurious acts which they were supposed to have indulged in(17, 18). Sometimes symbolic loops and ropes appear in vegetable form as foliagewhich inextricably envelops bodies that fall into it; this is a theme which is relatedto the symbolism of devouring, as well as to grotesques.Lorelei A siren in Germanic mythology who appears on a rock bearing hername in the Rhine, and whose song is the perdition of mariners, for when theyhear her singing they forget to watch out for the reefs and are dashed to pieces.The Lorelei is also related to the legend of the treasure of the Niebelungen.Loss On the one hand, the sense of loss is bound up with the feeling of guilttogether with a presentiment of ultimate purification or pilgrimage and journey-ing. On the other hand, the idea of losing and of rediscovering oneself, or thenotion of the ‘lost object’ that is missed very painfully, are concepts parallel tothat of death and resurrection (31). To feel lost or neglected is to feel dead, andhence, even though the blame for, or cause of, this feeling may be projected ontocircumstantial matters, the true cause always lies in forgetfulness of the Origin"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"LOVE193and severance of the individual’s attachment to it (as expressed in the thread ofAriadne). Within the twofold structure of the spirit (symbolized by the Geminitwins), loss corresponds to the equation of consciousness with the merely exis-tential aspect of life, ignoring the eternal aspect of the spirit; and it is this whichlies behind the ‘lost feeling’, or purposelessness, or the symbolic lost object.Lotus There is a certain parallel between the symbolism of the lotus and thatof the rose in Western culture. In Egypt, the lotus symbolizes nascent life, or firstappearance (19). Saunier regards it as a natural symbol for all forms of evolution(49). In the Middle Ages it was equated with the mystic ‘Centre’ and, conse-quently, with the heart (56, 14). As an artistic creation it is related to the mandala,its significance varying according to the number of its petals: the eight-petalledlotus-is considered in India as the Centre where Brahma dwells and as the visiblemanifestation of his occult activity (26). The figure eight is like the mandorla ofRomanesque art, signifying the intersection of the earth (four, or the square) withheaven (the circle). The ‘thousand-petalled’ lotus symbolizes the final revelation;in the centre there is usually a triangle and inside the triangle is the ‘great empti-ness’ symbolic of formlessness. René Guénon has examined lotus-symbolism atgreat length, observing that The potentialities of being are realized by means of anactivity which is always internal’ (this is the ‘growth’ of Father Gratry) ‘since itis exercised from the centre of each plane; furthermore, from the metaphysicalpoint of view, it is impossible for external action to be brought to bear upon thetotal being, for such action is possible only on a relative and a particular plane. .. . This realization of potentialities is depicted in various symbolisms as theunfolding of a flower on the surface of the “waters”; generally, in oriental tradi-tions, it is a lotus, and a rose or lis in the West. There is a further relationshipbetween these flowers and the circumference as a symbol of the manifest world,as well as with the cosmic Wheel. This symbol finds other forms of expression inmany different ways, but always related to the symbolism of numbers, that is,depending upon the number of petals’ (25). From the remotest days of antiquity,the lotus was the unanimous choice of the Chinese, the Japanese, the Hindus, theEgyptians and the Aryans. The lotus flower growing out of the navel of Vishnu,symbolizes the universe growing out of the central sun—the central point or the‘unmoved mover’. It is the attribute of many deities (9). In lotus symbolism, theidea of emanation and of realization predominated over that of the hidden Centre,which is a Western accretion.Love Traditional symbols of love always express a duality in which the twoantagonistic elements are, nevertheless, reconciled. Thus, the Indian lingam, the"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"LOVED ONE,THE                                                194Chinese Yang-Yin, or even the Cross, where the upright beam is the world-axis andthe cross-beam the world of phenomena. They are, in other words, symbols of aconjunction, or the expression of the ultimate goal of true love: the elimination ofdualism and separation, uniting them in the mystic ‘centre’, the ‘unvarying mean’of Far Eastern philosophy. The rose, the lotus flower, the heart, the irradiatingpoint—these are the most frequent symbols of this hidden centre; ‘hidden’ be-cause it does not exist in space, although it is imagined as doing so, but denotes thestate achieved through the elimination of separation. The biological act of loveitself expresses this desire to die in the object of the desire, to dissolve in thatwhich is already dissolved. According to the Book of Baruch: ‘Erotic desire andits satisfaction is the key to the origin of the world. Disappointment in love andthe revenge which follows in its wake are the root of all the evil and the selfishnessin this world. The whole of history is the work of love. Beings seek and find oneanother; separate and hurt one another; and in the end, comes acute sufferingwhich leads to renunciation.’ Or to put it another way: Maya as opposed toLilith, illusion balanced by the serpent.Loved One, The The woman loved, in the light of the Gnostic idea of thebeloved as a mediator personified in Sophia (q.v.) and the Catharist view ofhuman love as a form of mysticism, ceases to be a vessel for the perpetuation ofthe species and becomes a profoundly spiritual and spiritualizing entity, as inDante, the paintings of Rossetti, the most exalted of the romantics, or in AndréBreton (L’Amour fou). The earliest and purest expression of this conception ofthe beloved seems to have occurred in Persia.Lover, The The sixth enigma of the Tarot pack. It is related to the legend ofHercules which tells how he was given the choice of two women, the one personi-fying Virtue (or decisive activity, vocation, sense of purpose, and struggle) andthe other Vice (passiveness, surrender to base impulses and to external pres-sures). The Lover, faced like Hercules with these two opposite modes of con-duct, hesitates. He has parti-coloured clothes divided vertically: one half is red(for activity) and the other green (neutral—for indecision). On the positive side,this mystery-card implies the making of the right choice and represents moralbeauty or integrity; on the negative side it alludes to uncertainty and temptation(59).Lozenge One of the eight ‘common emblems’ of the Chinese, symbolic ofvictory. In graphics, the lozenge is simply a rhomb elongated along the verticalaxis (5). The rhomb is a dynamic sign, as in St. Andrew’s cross, and denotes theintercommunication between the inferior and the superior.194"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"MACE195Luz The Hebrew word luz has a number of meanings: city-centre, likeAgarttha; ‘mandorla’, or place of the apparition; and, according to Guénon (LeRoi du Monde), it also means ‘an indestructible corporeal particle, symbolized byan extremely hard bone to which a part of the soul remains attached from the timeof death to that of resurrection’. In Le Mystère de la vie et de la mort d’aprèsl’enseignement de l’ancienne Égypte, Enel agrees with this interpretation.Lycanthrope A legendary man whom the devil covers with a wolf’s skin andforces to roam howling over the countryside (8), and symbolic of the irrationalitylatent in the baser part of man and the possibility of his awakening. Hence, it issimilar in meaning to all evil monsters and fabulous beings.Lyre A symbol of the harmonious union of the cosmic forces, a union which,in its chaotic aspect, is represented by a flock of sheep (40). The seven strings ofthe lyre correspond to the seven planets. Timotheus of Miletus raised the num-ber of strings to twelve (corresponding to the signs of the Zodiac). A serialdevelopment of a similar kind is that effected by Arnold Schoenberg in our day bygiving the same value to chromatic notes as to the notes of the diatonic scale,creating in place of the old scale of seven notes, a new one of twelve. Schneiderdraws a parallel between the lyre and the fire, recalling that in the temple ofJerusalem (according to Exodus xxxviii, 2) there was an altar with horns ‘overlaidwith brass’ on either side, and the smoke of sacrifice rose up between them. Thelyre, similarly, produces its sounds through the horns forming the sides of itsstructure, and representing the relationship between earth and heaven (50).MMace A determinative sign in the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, governingthe ideas of the creative Word and achievement (19). It is related to the oar, thesceptre, the staff and the club, all of them symbolic instruments of one morpho-logical family. In Egypt the oar was also linked with the idea of creating. As aweapon, the mace denotes a crushing blow or utter destruction and not simplyvictory over the adversary; it is therefore used as the insignia denoting the anni-hilation of the subjective, assertive tendency in Man, and also of the monsterssymbolizing this tendency; for the same reason it is the attribute of Hercules (15)."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"MACHINES196Machines The symbolism of machines is founded upon the shape of theircomponents and the rhythm and direction of their movement. Broadly speaking,this symbolism finds its inspiration in the obvious analogy with the physiologi-cal functions of ingestion, digestion and reproduction.Macrocosm—Microcosm This relationship is symbolic of the situation inthe universe of man as the ‘measure of all things’. The basis of this relationship—which has occupied the minds of thinkers and mystics of all kinds in all ages—isthe symbolism of man himself, particularly as the ‘universal man’ together withhis ‘correspondences’ with the Zodiac, the planets and the Elements. As Origenobserved: ‘Understand that you are another world in miniature and that in you arethe sun, the moon and also the stars’ (33).Maize One of the eight ‘common emblems’ of China, maize is symbolic ofprosperity and is widely used in ornamental art (5). Almost all cereals have acommon meaning in that they are spermatic images. Peruvians represent fertilityby means of the figure of a woman made out of stalks of maize which they call‘the mother of the maize’ (17).Makara An Indian mythic monster, part-fish and part-crocodile. It is also tobe found in the ornamental art of the Indonesians.Man Man comes to see himself as a symbol in so far as he is conscious of hisbeing. Hallstatt art, in Austria, shows fine examples of animal-heads with humanfigures appearing above them. In India, in New Guinea, in the West as well, thebull’s or ox’s head with a human form drawn between the horns is a very commonmotif. Since the bull is a symbol for the father-heaven, man comes to be seen asboth his and the earth’s son (22), also, as a third possibility, the son of the sun andthe moon (49). The implications of Origen’s remark: ‘Understand that you areanother world in miniature and that in you are the sun, the moon and also thestars’, are to be found in all symbolic traditions. In Moslem esoteric thought, manis the symbol of universal existence (29), an idea which has found its way intocontemporary philosophy in the definition of man as ‘the messenger of being’;however, in symbolic theory, man is not defined by function alone (that ofappropriating the consciousness of the cosmos), but rather by analogy, wherebyhe is seen as an image of the universe. This analogical relationship is sometimesexpressed explicitly, as in some of the more ancient sections of the Upanishads—the Brihadaranyaka and the Chandogya for instance—where the analogy be-tween the human organism and the macrocosmos is drawn step by step by meansof correspondences with the organs of the body and the senses (7). So, forexample, the components of the nervous system are derived from fiery sub-stance, and blood from watery substance (26).

The five senses were given analogies in accordance with asystem which came to Europe, perhaps, from the Hebrews and the Greeks (14).Thus, Hildegard of Bingen, living in the same period, states that man is disposedaccording to the number five: he is of five equal parts in height and five in girth; hehas five senses, and five members, echoed in the hand as five fingers. Hence thepentagram is a sign of the microcosmos.

There is a relationship, too, between the organiclaws of Man and the Cistercian temple (14). Fabre d’Olivet, following the Cabala,maintains that another number closely associated with the human being is nine—the triple ternary. He divides human potentialities into three planes: those of thebody, of the soul or life and of the spirit. Each of these planes is characterized bythree modes: the active, the passive and the neutral (43). In the Far East, also,speculation about the symbolism of man began very early. The same kind oftriple ternary organization is to be seen in the ancient teachings of the Taoists(13). It is also interesting to note that there is a relationship between the humanbeing and the essential or archetypal animals (the turtle, the phoenix, the dragonand the unicorn) who appear to bear the same relation to man—who is central—as the tetramorphs do to the Pantokrator. Now, between man as a concreteindividual and the universe there is a medial term—a mesocosmos. And thismesocosmos is the ‘Universal Man’, the King (Wang) in Far Eastern tradition,and the Adam Kadmon of the Cabala. He symbolizes the whole pattern of theworld of manifestation, that is, the complete range of possibilities open to man-kind. In a way, the concept corresponds to Jung’s ‘collective unconscious’. Ac-cording to Guénon, Leibniz—perhaps influenced by Raymond Lull—concededthat every ‘individual substance’ must contain within itself an integral reproduc-tion of the universe, even if only as an image, just as the seed contains the totalityof the being into which it will develop (25). In Indian symbolism, Vaishvânara, orthe ‘Universal Man’, is divided into seven principal sections: (1) The superior,luminous spheres as a whole, or the supreme states of being; (2) the sun and themoon—or rather, the principles to which they pertain—as expressed in the rightand the left eye respectively; (3) the fire-principle—the mouth; (4) the directionsof space—the ears; (5) the atmosphere—the lungs; (6) the intermediary zonebetween earth and heaven—the stomach; (7) the earth—the natural functions orthe lower part of the body. The heart is not mentioned, because, being the ‘centre’or dwelling-place of Brahma, it is regarded as being beyond the ‘wheel’ of things(26). Now, this concept of the ‘Universal Man’ implies hermaphroditism, thoughnever specifically. For the concrete, existential human being, in so far as he iseither a man or a woman, represents the dissected ‘human’ whole, not only in thephysical sense but also spiritually. Thus, to quote the Upanishads: ‘He was, intruth, as big as a man and a woman embracing. He divided this atman into twoparts; from them sprang husband and wife.’ In Western iconography one some-times finds images which would seem to be echoes of this concept (32). A humancouple, by their very nature, must always symbolize the urge to unite what is infact discrete. Figures which are shown embracing one another, or joining hands, or"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"MANDALA199growing out of roots which bind them together, and so on, symbolize ‘conjunc-tion’, that is, coincidentia oppositorum. There is a Hindu image representing the‘joining of the unjoinable’ (analogous to the marriage of fire and water) by theinterlinking of Man and Woman, which may be taken to symbolize the joining ofall opposites: good and bad, high and low, cold and hot, wet and dry, and so on(32). In alchemy, Man and Woman symbolize sulphur and mercury (the metal).In psychology, level-symbolism is often brought to bear upon the members of thebody, so that the right side corresponds to the conscious level and the left to theunconscious. The shapes of the parts of the body, depending upon whether theyare positive or negative—whether they are protuberances or cavities—should beseen not only as sex-symbols but also in the light of the symbolism of levels. Thehead is almost universally regarded as a symbol of virility (56). The attitudeswhich the body may take up are of great symbolic importance, because they areboth the instrument and the expression of the human tendency towards ascendenceand evolution. A position with the arms wide open pertains to the symbolism ofthe cross. And a posture in the form of the letter ‘X’ refers to the union of the twoworlds, a symbol which is related to the hour-glass, the ‘X’ and all other symbolsof intersection (50). Another important posture is that of Buddha in the tradi-tional iconography of the Orient, a posture characteristic also of some Celtic godssuch as the so-called ‘Bouray god’ or the famous Roquepertuse figure. Thissquatting position expresses the renunciation of the ‘baser part’ and of ambula-tory movement and symbolizes identification with the mystic centre.Mandala This is a Hindu term for a circle. It is a kind of yantra (instrument,means or emblem), in the form of a ritual geometric diagram, sometimes corre-sponding to a specific, divine attribute or to some form of enchantment (mantra)which is thus given visual expression (6). Cammann suggests that mandalas werefirst brought to Tibet from India by the great guru Padma Sambhava in the 8thcentury A.D. They are to be found all over the Orient, and always as a meanstowards contemplation and concentration—as an aid in inducing certain mentalstates and in encouraging the spirit to move forward along its path of evolutionfrom the biological to the geometric, from the realm of corporeal forms to thespiritual. According to Heinrich Zimmer, mandalas are not only painted or drawn,but are also actually built in three dimensions for some festivals. One of themembers of the Lamaist convent of Bhutia Busty, Lingdam Gomchen, describedthe mandala to Carl Gustav Jung as ‘a mental image which may be built up in theimagination only by a trained lama’. He maintained that ‘no one mandala is thesame as another’: all are different because each is a projected image of thepsychic condition of its author, or in other words, an expression of the modifi-"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"MANDALA200cation brought by this psychic content to the traditional idea of the mandala.Thus, the mandala is a synthesis of a traditional structure plus free interpreta-tion. Its basic components are geometric figures, counterbalanced and concen-tric. Hence it has been said that ‘the mandala is always a squaring of the circle’..There are some works—the Shri-Chakra-Sambhara-Tantra is one—which pre-scribe rules for the better imagining of this image. Coinciding in essence with themandala are such figures as the Wheel of the Universe, the Mexican ‘Great Calen-dar Stone’, the lotus flower, the mythic flower of gold, the rose, and so on. In apurely psychological sense it is feasible to identify the mandala with all figuresThe expanding centre—a concept exemplified in the Shri-Yantra mandala"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"MANDALA201composed of various elements enclosed in a square or a circle—for instance, thehoroscope, the labyrinth, the zodiacal circle, figures representing ‘The Year’ andalso the clock. Groundplans of circular, square or octagonal buildings are alsomandalas. As for the three-dimensional form, there are temples built after thepattern of the mandala with its essential counterbalancing of elements, its geo-metric form and significant number of component elements. The stupa in India isthe most characteristic of these temples. Again, according to Cammann, there aresome Chinese shields and mirror-backs which are mandalas. In short, the mandalais, above all, an image and a synthesis of the dualistic aspects of differentiationand unification, of variety and unity, the external and the internal, the diffuse andthe concentrated (32). It excludes disorder and all related symbolisms, because,by its very nature, it must surmount disorder. It is, then, the visual, plasticexpression of the struggle to achieve order—even within diversity—and of thelonging to be reunited with the pristine, non-spatial and non-temporal ‘Centre’,as it is conceived in all symbolic traditions. However, since the preoccupationwith ornamentation—that is, with unconscious symbolism—is in effect a con-cern for ordering a certain area—that is, for bringing order into chaos—it followsthat this struggle has two aspects: firstly, the possibility that some would-bemandalas are the product of the simple (aesthetic or utilitarian) desire for order,and secondly, the consideration that the mandala proper takes its inspirationfrom the mystic longing for supreme integration. In Jung’s view, mandalas and allconcomitant images—prior, parallel or consequent—of the kind mentioned above,are derived from dreams and visions corresponding to the most basic of religioussymbols known to mankind—symbols which are known to have existed as farback as the Palaeolithic Age (as is proved, for example, by the Rhodesian rockengravings). Many cultural, artistic or allegorical works, and many of the imagesused in numismatics, must have sprung from this same primordial interest in thepsychic or inner structure (with its external counterpart to which so many ritespertaining to the founding of cities and temples, to the divisions of heavens, toorientation and the space-time relationship, bear eloquent testimony). The juxta-position of the circle, the triangle and the square (numerically the equivalents ofthe numbers one and ten; three; and four and seven) plays a fundamental rôle inthe most ‘classic’ and authentic of oriental mandalas. Even though the mandalaalways alludes to the concept of the Centre—never actually depicting it visuallybut suggesting it by means of the concentricity of the figures—at the same time itexemplifies the obstacles in the way of achieving and assimilating the Centre. Inthis way, the mandala fulfils its function as an aid to man in his efforts to regroupall that is dispersed around a single axis—the Jungian Selbst. It is of interest to"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"MANDALA202note that the same problem occupied the alchemists, except that a very differentaspect of being was under investigation. Jung suggests that the mandala repre-sents an autonomous psychic fact, or ‘a kind of nucleus about whose intimatestructure and ultimate meaning we have no direct knowledge’ (32). Mircea Eliade,speaking as an historian of religions and not as a psychologist, sees the mandalachiefly as an objective symbol, an imago mundi rather than a projection of themind, without, however, discrediting the latter interpretation. The structure of atemple—the Borobudur temple for instance—in the form of a mandala has as itsaim the creation of a monumental image of life and the ‘distortion’ of the world tomake it a suitable vehicle for the expression of the concept of supreme orderwhich man—the neophyte or initiate—might then enter as he would enter intohis own spirit. The same is true of the great mandalas traced on the ground withcoloured threads or coloured dust. Here, rather than serving the purposes ofcontemplation, they have a ritual function in which a man may move graduallytowards the inner area, identifying himself with each stage and each zone as hegoes. This rite is analogous to that of entering into the labyrinth (denoting thequest for the Centre) (18), and the psychological and spiritual implications areself-evident. There are some mandalas which counterbalance not enclosed figuresbut numbers arranged in geometric discontinuity (for instance: four points, thenfive, then three), and are then identified with the Cardinal Points, the Elements,colours, and so on, the significance of the mandala being wonderfully enriched bythese additional symbolisms. Mirrors of the Han dynasty depict the numbersfour and eight balancing each other and disposed round the centre in five zoneswhich correspond to the five Elements (that is, the four material Elements plusthe spirit or quintessence). In the West, alchemy made quite frequent use offigures having a definite affinity with the mandala, composed of counterpoisedcircles, triangles and squares. According to Heinrich Khunrath, the triangle withinthe square produces the circle. There are, as Jung has pointed out, ‘distorted’mandalas different in form from the above and based upon the numbers six, eightand twelve; but they are comparatively rare. In all mandalas in which numbers arethe predominant element, it is number-symbolism which can best plumb itsmeaning. The interpretation should be such that the superior (or the principal)elements are always those nearest the centre. Thus, the circle within the square isa more developed structure than the square within the circle. And the samerelationship to the square holds good for the triangle; the struggle between thenumber three and the number four seems to represent that between the centralelements of the spirit (corresponding to three) and the peripheral components,that is, the Cardinal Points as the image of ordered externality (corresponding to"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"MANDORLA203four). The outer circle, on the other hand, always fulfils the unifying function ofoverriding the contradictions and the irregularities of angles and sides by means ofits implicit movement. The characteristics of the ShriYantra, one of the finestmandala-instruments, have been explained by Luc Benoist. It is composed arounda central point which is the metaphysical and irradiating point of primordialenergy; however, this energy is not manifest and therefore the central point doesnot actually appear in the drawing, but has to be visualized. Surrounding it is acomplex pattern of nine triangles—an image of the transcendent worlds; four ofthese triangles have the apex pointing upwards and the other five downwards.The intermediate—or subtle—world is suggested by a triple aureole surroundingthe triangles. An eight-petalled lotus (signifying regeneration), together with oth-ers of sixteen petals, and a triple circle, complete this symbolic representation ofthe spiritual world. The fact that it exists within the material world is suggestedby a triple-lined serrated surround, signifying orientation in space (6).Mandorla Although the geometric symbol of the earth is the square (or thecube) and the symbol of heaven is the circle, two circles are sometimes used tosymbolize the Upper and the Lower worlds, that is, heaven and earth. The unionof the two worlds, or the zone of intersection and interpenetration (the world ofappearances), is represented by the mandorla, an almond-shaped figure formedby two intersecting circles. In order that, for the purposes of iconography, themandorla might be drawn vertically, the two circles have come to be regarded asthe left (matter) and the right (spirit). The zone of existence symbolized by themandorla, like the twin-peaked Mountain of Mars, embraces the opposing polesof all dualism (51). Hence it is a symbol also of the perpetual sacrifice thatregenerates creative force through the dual streams of ascent and descent (appear-ance and disappearance, life and death, evolution and involution). Morphologi-cally, it is cognate with the spindle of the Magna Mater and with the magicalspinners of thread (50).The mandorla symbolizes theintersection of the twospheres of heaven and earth."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"MANDRAGORA204Mandragora (or Mandrake) A plant which was supposed to have variousmagic properties, a belief arising out of the likeness of its roots to the humanform. Mandragora was also the name of the ghost of a devil, who appeared as atiny black man, beardless and with unkempt hair (8). For the primitive mind, themandrake represented the soul in its negative and its minimal aspects.Man-Eating Monster A monster, dragon or sea-serpent with a human beingin its jaws, symbolizes the danger of being devoured by the destructive forces ofthe unconscious, a fate to which only the most noble of man’s faculties, such ashis reason or his morals, are susceptible. In mediaeval iconography, this monster’shead is an allegory of the gates of hell.Manicora A fabulous being which figures in Romanesque decoration, aquadruped covered in scales and with the head of a woman wearing a kind ofPhrygian cap. Its significance may be compared with that of the siren; scalesalways allude to the ocean—to the primordial, Lower Waters.Marriage In alchemy, a symbol of ‘Conjunction’, represented symbolicallyalso by the union of sulphur and mercury—of the King and the Queen. Jung hasshown that there is a parallel between this alchemic significance and the intimateunion or inner conciliation—within the process of individuation—of the uncon-scious, feminine side of man with his spirit.Mars The primitive and astrobiological conception of creation is that it cantake place only through ‘primordial sacrifice’; similarly, what has been createdcan only be preserved through sacrifice and war. The image of Janus, or the twin-peaked mountain of Mars, are symbols of inversion, that is, of the intercommu-nication between the Upper, non-formed World of future potentialities, and theLower World of materialized forms. Schneider insists upon this principle ascharacteristic of the primordial order, commenting that ‘its rigid law demands adeath for each life, sublimates the criminal instinct to serve good and humanitarianends, and fuses love and hate in the interests of the renewal of life. In order topreserve the order of existence, the gods struggled with the giants and monsterswho from the beginning of creation sought to devour the sun’—the Logos (50).Mars is the perennial incarnation of this necessity for the shedding of blood,apparent in all orders of the cosmos. Hence, early cults of Mars embraced vegeta-tion: it was to Mars that the Roman farmer appealed for the prosperity of hisharvest (21). His attributes are weapons, and specially the sword.Marsh According to Schneider, marshlands are a symbol of the ‘decomposi-tion of the spirit’; that is, they are the place in which this occurs because of thelack of the two active elements (air and fire) and the fusion of the two passiveelements (water and earth). Therefore, in legends, novels of chivalry, etc., marshesappear with this meaning. In the story of Gawain, knight of the Round Table, the"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"MASK205protagonist finds himself in a marsh, and this implies his inability to bring hisenterprise to a successful conclusion, just as when he is unable to mend the‘broken sword’. In The Lovers, by Leslie Stevens, the protagonist finds himselfobliged to defend marshlands from a tower which has been profaned, premoni-tory signs of his downfall and death.Mask All transformations are invested with something at once of profoundmystery and of the shameful, since anything that is so modified as to become‘something else’ while still remaining the thing that it was, must inevitably beproductive of ambiguity and equivocation. Therefore, metamorphoses must behidden from view—and hence the need for the mask. Secrecy tends towardstransfiguration: it helps what-one-is to become what-one-would-like-to-be; andthis is what constitutes its magic character, present in both the Greek theatricalmask and in the religious masks of Africa or Oceania. The mask is equivalent tothe chrysalis. Frazer has noted some very peculiar types of masks used in theinitiation ceremonies of some Oceanian peoples: the youths keep their eyesclosed and cover their faces with a mask of paste or fuller’s earth, and pretend notto hear the orders shouted out by their elders. But they gradually recover, and onthe following day they wash themselves clean of the crust which had coveredtheir faces (as well as their bodies); and their initiation is then complete (21).Apart from this—the most essential—symbolic meaning, the mask also consti-tutes an image bearing another symbolic meaning which derives directly from it.The mask, simply as a face, comes to express the solar and energetic aspects ofthe life-process.

And when this creature demands ofhis creator a victim to devour, the god tells him to eat of his own body, which themonster does so that it is reduced to a mere mask itself (60). There is a Chinesesymbol, T’ao T’ieh—the ‘mask of the ogre’—which may well be similar in origin(5).Matron A form of personification very common in all symbolic imagesbearing upon the feminine principle; she appears not as spirit but as mother-protector: the Night, the Earth, the Church or the Synagogue, for example. Citiestoo are very often personified as matrons wearing a mural crown. Their attributesand features add the finishing touches to the symbolic content of the image (32).Psychologically speaking, the matron seems to express the domineering side ofthe mother.Matter According to Evola, matter is equivalent to the moon, and form to thesun.Maya ‘The lesson may be read psychologically, as applying to ourselves,who are not gods but limited beings. The constant projection and externalizationof our specific shakti (vital energy) is our “little universe”, our restricted sphereand immediate environment, whatever concerns and affects us. We people andcolour the indifferent, neutral screen with the movie-figures and dramas of theinward dream of our soul, and fall prey then to its dramatic events, delights, andcalamities. The world, not as it is in itself but as we perceive it and react upon it,is the product of our own maya or delusion. It can be described as our own moreor less blind life-energy, producing and projecting demonic or beneficent shapesand appearances. Thus we are the captives of our own Maya-Shakti and of themotion picture that it incessantly produces. . . . The Highest Being is the lord andmaster of Maya. All the rest of us . . . are the victims of our own individual Maya.. . . To liberate man from such a spell . . . is the principal aim of all the great Indianphilosophies.’ (60)Meadow Bachelard has pointed out that the meadow, being nourished by thewaters of a river, is in itself a subject of sadness and that, in the true meadow ofthe soul, only asphodels grow. The winds find no melodious trees in the meadow—only the silent waves of uniform grass. Bachelard also mentions Empedocles’description of ‘the meadow of ill fortune’ (2).Melusina A fairy occurring in legends, sometimes in the form of a siren. Jeand’Arras dealt specifically with this fabulous being in La Noble Hystoire de Luzignen(1393). When a great disaster was about to befall she would give voice to a screamthrice repeated. ‘Melusina it was who caused mysterious buildings to be set up ina single night by swarms of workers who would disappear without trace once the"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"MERCURY207work had been completed. When she marries, all her children have some physicalabnormality; in the same way, her magic buildings all have some defect, like thosebridges of the devil which always have one stone missing’ (16). Melusina seemsto be the archetype of intuitive genius, in so far as intuition is prophetic, con-structive and wondrous, and yet at the same time is infirm and malign.Menhir Like all stones, the menhir embraces the idea of lithophany. Inparticular, because it stands erect, it is symbolic of the masculine principle andvigilance. It is further related to the sacrificial stake and, in consequence, to theworld-axis (with all its related symbols: the cosmic tree, the steps, the cross, etc.)(50). There are also phallic as well as protective implications, as Eliade has noted(17).Mephistopheles He represents the negative, infernal aspect of the psychicfunction which has broken away from the All to acquire independence and anindividual character of its own (32).Mercury The planetary god and the metal bearing his name. In astronomy, heis the son of heaven and light; in mythology, he was engendered by Jupiter andMaia. In essence he is the messenger of heaven. His Greek name of Hermessignifies ‘interpreter’ or ‘mediator’. Hence it is his task to conduct the souls of thedead to the Lower World. Like Hecate, he is often triform, that is, representedwith three heads. He epitomizes the power of the spoken word—the emblem ofthe word; and for the Gnostics he was the logos spermatikos scattered about theuniverse, an idea which was taken up by the alchemists who equated Mercurywith related concepts of fluency and transmutation (9). At the same time, he wasseen as a god of roads (that is, of potentialities) (4). In astrology he is defined as‘intellectual energy’. The nervous system is controlled by him, for the nerves aremessengers on the biological plane (40). Probably it was the alchemists, withtheir lofty speculations, who penetrated farthest into the archetypal structure ofMercury. In many cases they identified their transmutation-substance with the‘lively planet’, that is, with the god whose metal is white and decidedly lunar.However, since Mercury is the planet nearest to the sun (related to gold), theresultant archetype has a double nature (of a chthonian god and a celestial god—a hermaphrodite) (32). Mercury (the metal) symbolizes the unconscious becauseof its fluid and dynamic character; it is essentially duplex for, in one way, it is aninferior being, a devil or monster, but in another sense it is the ‘philosophers’child’ (33). Hence, its unlimited capacity for transformation (as in the case of allliquids) came to be symbolic of the essential aim of the alchemist to transmutematter (and spirit) from the inferior to the superior, from the transitory to the"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"METALS208stable. Mercury was also credited with an unlimited aptitude for penetration(32). Its synonyms of Monstrum hermaphroditus and Rebis (‘something double’)reveal its close connexion with the Gemini myth (Atma and Buddhi); its repre-sentation as a feminine figure and Anima mundi (32) is more frequent and signifi-cant than its absorption by the masculine principle alone. In this connexion RenéAlleau recalls that the essential stages of the alchemic process were: prime matter,Mercury, Sulphur, Lapis. The first phase corresponds to indifferentiation; thesecond to the lunar and feminine principle; the third to the masculine and solar,the fourth to absolute synthesis (which Jung identifies with the process of indi-viduation). The attributes of Mercury are the winged hat and sandals, the cadu-ceus, the club, the turtle and the lyre (which he invented and gave to Apollo) (8).Metals In astrology they are called ‘terrestrial’ or ‘subterranean planets’,because of the analogous correspondences between the planets and the metals(57). For this reason astrologers consider that there are only seven metals (influ-enced by the same number of spheres), which does not mean that mankind duringthe astrobiological period did not recognize more. As Piobb has pointed out, someengineers have noted that the seven planetary metals make up a series which isapplicable to the system of the twelve polygons (48). But, apart from the theoryof correspondences, the metals symbolize cosmic energy in solidified form and,in consequence, the libido. On this basis, Jung has asserted that the base metalsare the desires and the lusts of the flesh. Extracting the quintessence from thesemetals, or transmuting them into higher metals, is equivalent to setting creativeenergy free from the fetters of the sense world (33), a process identical with whatesoteric tradition and astrology regard as liberation from the ‘planetary influ-ences’. The metals can be grouped within a progressive ‘series’ in which eachmetal displays its hierarchical superiority over the one preceding it, with gold asthe culminating point of the progression. This is why, in certain rites, the neo-phyte is required to divest himself of his ‘metals’—coins, keys, trinkets—be-cause they are symbolic of his habits, prejudices and characteristics, etc. (9). We,for our part, however, are inclined to believe that in each particular pairing ofplanet with metal (as Mars with iron) there is an essential element of theambitendent, in that its positive quality tends one way and its negative defecttends the other. Molten metal is an alchemic symbol expressing the coniunctiooppositorum (the conjunction of fire and water), related to mercury, Mercury andPlato’s primordial, androgynous being. And at the same time, the solid or ‘closed’properties of matter emphasize its symbolism as a liberator—hence the connexionwith Hermes the psychopomp mentioned under ‘Mercury’ above (32). The"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"MINOTAUR209correspondences between the planets and the metals, from inferior to superior,are: Saturn—lead, Jupiter—tin, Mars—iron, Venus—copper, Mercury—mer-cury, Moon—silver, Sun—gold.Metamorphosis The transformation of one being or of one species intoanother generally relates to the broad symbolism of Inversion, but also to theessential notion of the difference between primigenial, undifferentiated Onenessand the world of manifestation. Everything may be transformed into anythingelse, since nothing is really anything. Transmutation is quite another matter: it ismetamorphosis in an ascending direction, carrying all appearances away from themoving rim of the Wheel of Transformations along the radial path to the ‘Un-moved mover’—the non-spatial and timeless Centre. ‘The duplicity of Mercurius’,writes Jung, ‘his simultaneously metallic and pneumatic nature, is a parallel to thesymbolization of an extremely spiritual idea like the Anthropos by a corporeal,indeed metallic substance (gold). One can only conclude that the unconscioustends to regard spirit and matter not merely as equivalent but as actually identical,and this in flagrant contrast to the intellectual one-sidedness of consciousness,which would sometimes like to materialize matter and at other times to material-ize spirit. . . .’Minaret The minaret is a symbolic torch of spiritual illumination, since itembraces the symbols of the tower (on account of its height) and the belvedere orwatch-tower (signifying the consciousness). Hence it appears as a figure emblem-atic of the city of the Sun—or Camelot, where King Arthur held his court. Thesame symbolic sense is sometimes represented by a skyline with towers andpinnacles (4).Minotaur A fabulous monster the lower half of which was a man and theupper a bull. It was in order to contain the minotaur that the Cretan Labyrinthwas constructed. The monster was carnivorous, and the vanquished Athenianswere obliged every seven years to deliver up seven youths and seven maidens forit to eat. This tribute was paid three times, but on the fourth occasion Theseusslew the minotaur with the aid of Ariadne and her magic thread (8). Every mythand legend which alludes to tributes, monsters or victorious heroes illustrates atonce a cosmic situation (embracing the Gnostic ideas of the evil demiurge and ofredemption), a social implication (for example, of a state oppressed by a tyrant,or a plague, or by some other hostile force) and a psychological significancepertaining either to the collective or the individual (implying the predominance ofthe monster in man, and the tribute and sacrifice of his finer side: his ideas,sentiments and emotions). The minotaur all but represents the last degree in the"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"MINSTREL, THE210scale of relations between the spiritual and the animal sides in man. The predomi-nance of the spiritual is symbolized by the knight; the prevalence of the mon-strous is denoted by the centaur with the body of a horse or bull. The inversionof this, where the head is animal-like and the body human, implies the dominanceof base forces carried to its logical extreme. The symbolism of the number seven(as in seven-headed dragons, or a period of seven years, or the sacrifice of sevenyouths) always denotes a relationship with the essential series (namely: the daysof the week, the planetary gods, the planets, and the Vices and Cardinal Sinstogether with their corresponding Virtues). To vanquish a seven-headed monsteris to conquer the evil influences of the planets (in consequence of the equation ofthe planets with the instincts and the baser forces).Minstrel, The The first enigma of the Tarot pack, this figure of a minstrel isa symbol of the original activity and the creative power of Man. He is depicted onthe Tarot card wearing a hat in the form of a horizontal eight (the mathematicalsign for infinity); he holds up a magic wand (‘clubs’) in one hand, and the otherthree symbols of the card-pack are on the table facing him; these are the equiva-lent of diamonds, spades and hearts, which, together with the wand (‘clubs’),correspond to the four Elements (as well as the points of the compass). Theseattributes symbolize mastery over a given situation. The minstrel’s garb is multi-coloured, but the predominant colour is red—denoting activity. In its transcen-dental implications, the enigma is related to Mercury (59).Mirabilia During Antiquity and the Middle Ages, this name was given tostrange and amazing incidents (the hidden powers of animals, plants and stones,natural phenomena, ‘miracles’, and the sympathies or antipathies which unite orseparate such beings or incidents). The literature of the ‘Mirabilia’ obtained agreat success, especially in Hellenistic Egypt, whence it passed to the mediaevalWestern world via the Arabs. Strange or amazing incidents are frequently tradi-tional symbols and were sometimes connected with magic and alchemy. Accord-ing to the Rev. Fr. Festugière O.P. in La Révélation d’Hermès Trismégiste, Bolusthe Democritean (c. 200 B.C.), Pseudo-Manetho (2nd-1st centuries B.C.), NigidiusFigulus (1st century B.C.), Demetrius and Apollodorus (1st century A.D.) greatlycontributed to the upsurge of this literature. It continued to evolve, tinged withhermetism, and found its fullest expression in the Book of the Things of Nature,written in Syria at the beginning of the 7th century. The general symbolic meaningof the ‘Mirabilia’ doubtless corresponds to the equation orgy = chaos, estab-lished by Eliade. They express a nostalgia for the era of animist indifferentism,which, in part, can also be seen to take refuge in contemporary poetry, especially"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"MIRROR211that of the symbolist movement. On the other hand, the belief in ‘powers’ andeven in a personal psychology of all beings, their aspects and qualities, becamewell rooted in the Western world, down through the Lower Middle Ages, theRenaissance, and the baroque period. For example, Father J. E. Nieremberg’sbook, Oculta filosofía de la Sympatia y antipatía de las cosas, Artificio de laNaturaleza y noticia naturel del mundo, published in Barcelona in 1645, belongsto this ideological stream.Mirror As a symbol, it has the same characteristics as the mirror in fact; thetemporal and existential variety of its function provides the explanation of itssignificance and at the same time the diversity of its meaningful associations. Ithas been said that it is a symbol of the imagination—or of consciousness—in itscapacity to reflect the formal reality of the visible world. It has also been relatedto thought, in so far as thought—for Scheler and other philosophers—is theinstrument of self-contemplation as well as the reflection of the universe. Thislinks mirror-symbolism with water as a reflector and with the Narcissus myth:the cosmos appears as a huge Narcissus regarding his own reflections in thehuman consciousness. Now, the world, as a state of discontinuity affected by thelaws of change and substitution, is the agent which projects this quasinegative,kaleidoscopic image of appearance and disappearance reflected in the mirror.From the earliest times, the mirror has been thought of as ambivalent. It is asurface which reproduces images and in a way contains and absorbs them. Inlegend and folklore, it is frequently invested with a magic quality—a mere hyper-trophic version of its fundamental meaning. In this way it serves to invokeapparitions by conjuring up again the images which it has received at some timein the past, or by annihilating distances when it reflects what was once an objectfacing it and now is far removed. This fluctuation between the ‘absent’ mirror andthe ‘peopled’ mirror lends it a kind of phasing, feminine in implication, andhence—like the fan—it is related to moon-symbolism. Further evidence that themirror is lunar is afforded by its reflecting and passive characteristics, for itreceives images as the moon receives the light of the sun (8). Again, its closerelationship to the moon is demonstrated by the fact that among the primitives itwas seen as a symbol of the multiplicity of the soul: of its mobility and its abilityto adapt itself to those objects which ‘visit’ it and retain its ‘interest’. At times,it takes the mythic form of a door through which the soul may free itself ‘passing’to the other side: this is an idea reproduced by Lewis Carroll in Alice Through theLooking Glass.

All that we have said so far by no means exhauststhe complex symbolism of the mirror: like the echo, it stands for twins (thesis andantithesis), and specifically for the sea of flames (or life as an infirmity) (50, 51).For Loeffler, mirrors are magic symbols for unconscious memories (comparablewith crystal palaces) (38). Hand-mirrors, in particular, are emblems of truth (4),and in China they are supposed to have an allegorical function as aids to conjugalhappiness as well as a protection against diabolical influences (5). Some Chineselegends tell of ‘the animals in the mirror’.Mist Mist is symbolic of things indeterminate, or the fusing together of theElements of air and water, and the inevitable obscuring of the outlines of eachaspect and each particular phase of the evolutive process. The ‘mist of fire’ is thatstage of cosmic life which follows upon the state of chaos (9) and corresponds tothe three Elements which existed prior to the solid Element—earth.Mistletoe A parasitic plant associated with the oak. Celtic druids once usedto gather it to use in their fertility rites (8). It symbolizes regeneration and therestoration of family-life (49). Frazer has equated it with the ‘golden bough’, ofwhich Virgil wrote: ‘A wondrous tree shimmering with a golden light among thegreen foliage. Just as, throughout the cold winter, the mistletoe, guest of a treethat never engendered it, unfailingly displays its fresh greenery, flecking thesombre trunk with the yellow of its berries, just so do golden leaves show amongthe green foliage of the oak, and so would these golden leaves whisper to thegentle breeze’ (Aeneid, VI). The yellow colour of the withered mistletoe-branchwas thought—by a process of sympathetic magic—to be endowed with thepower to discover buried treasure (21).Monkey The simians generally symbolize the baser forces, darkness orunconscious activity, but this symbolism—like that of legendary fabulous be-ings—has two sides to it. If, on the one hand, this unconscious force may bedangerous, while it may degrade the individual, nevertheless it may also prove aboon—like all unconscious powers—when least expected. This is why, in China,the monkey is credited with the power of granting good health, success andprotection, being related in this way to sprites, sorcerers and fairies (5).Monolith In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, the monolith is a determi-native sign associated with the name of the god Osiris and signifying ‘to last’. Inthe myth, Osiris was slain by Set (or Typhon) and put together again by Isis. Theceremony performed in commemoration of this event included the erection of amonolith (a symbol of lithophanic unity) as a sign of resurrection and life eternal(19), or of unity counterbalancing multiplicity, fragmentation and disintegration"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"MONSTERS213(this, in turn, being a symbol of the world of phenomena ‘fallen’ into the multi-plicity of the diverse—space—and the transitory—time). The monolith, becauseof its shape and position, possesses other secondary meanings alluding—as inthe case of the menhir—to the masculine, the solar and the procreative principle.Monsters They are symbolic of the cosmic forces at a stage one stepremoved from chaos—from the ‘non-formal potentialities’. On the psychologicalplane, they allude to the base powers which constitute the deepest strata ofspiritual geology, seething as in a volcano until they erupt in the shape of somemonstrous apparition or activity. Diel suggests that they symbolize an unbal-anced psychic function: the affective whipping up of desire, paroxysms of theindulged imagination, or improper intentions (15). They are, then, par excellence,the antithesis—or the adversary—of the ‘hero’ and of ‘weapons’. For weaponsare the positive powers granted to man by the deity, and this is the explanation ofthe mysterious, miraculous or magical context of weapons wielded by heroes inmyth and legend. Weapons, then, are the symbolic antithesis to monsters. Dielhas pointed out that, paradoxically, the chimerical enemy—perversion, the fasci-nation of madness or of evil per se—is the fundamental adversary in the life ofMan. On the social plane, the motif of the monster ravaging a country is symbolicof the ill-fated reign of a wicked, tyrannical or impotent monarch (15). The fightagainst a monster signifies the struggle to free consciousness from the grip of theunconscious. The hero’s deliverance corresponds to the sunrise, the triumph oflight over darkness, of consciousness or the spirit over the affective strata of theunconscious (31). In a less negative sense, the monster may be equated with thelibido (56). Monsters are closely connected in symbolism with fabulous beings,which afford a wider range of meanings embracing some that are wholly favourableand positive such as Pegasus, the phoenix, etc. Some of the principal monstersknown to tradition and perpetuated by art are the following: the sphinx, thegriffin, the siren-fish, the siren-bird, the lamia, the bird with the head of a quadru-ped, the bird-serpent, the winged bull, the dragon, the giant fish, the giant sea-serpent, the chimaera, the Gorgon, the minotaur, the triton, the hydra, the sala-mander, the merman, the harpy, the hippogryph, the sea-demon and the Fury(36). The head of a monster, dragon or sea animal, with one or more human headsin its mouth, is a mediaeval symbol of hell. Psychologically it represents thedanger of being devoured by the destructive forces of some species, a dangerwhich may affect only the more noble parts of the human being, such as his moralsense or his reason. For Walter Abell, in The Collective Dream in Art (Cambridge,1957), monsters also symbolize the latent and dangerous forces, in a greater or"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"MONTSALVAT214lesser state of freedom, of the human unconscious in its aggressive and uglyaspect. He points out that monsters are the principal characters in the 7th-century Anglo-Saxon poem, Beowulf. He establishes an interesting comparisonand asserts that, in later prehistory (the Neolithic Age, the Age of Metals), themonsters dominated the gods; between Antiquity and the Romanesque period,the gods succeeded in counterbalancing the monsters, who, nevertheless, stillplayed an important rôle (as revealed, for example, in miniatures and capitals ofthe time); and in the Gothic period, the angelic spirits triumphed over the mon-sters. In more than one aspect, contemporary art, especially since Blake andGoya, might be taken as pointing to a certain ‘resurrection of the monsters’ and ofthe monstrous, as seen particularly in the surrealist movement.Montsalvat In the legend of the Grail, it is the mons salvationis, the peaksituated ‘on distant shores which no mortal may approach’, similar to the Hindumount Meru, the polar mountain. It is the symbol of supreme spiritual fulfilment.Montserrat There are some prehistoric paintings that depict a squatting manin such a way that his outline resembles the jagged or ‘serrated’ skyline of amountain. And—although it is mere coincidence—the significance of Montserrat(the ‘Serrated Mountain’ near Barcelona) is precisely that it presents Man asoccupying, through sacrifice, a marginal position at the point of intersection ofthe circles of heaven and earth (corresponding to the cross-symbolism). At thesame time, some mediaeval representations of the siren are entitled Serra.Moon The symbolism of the moon is wide in scope and very complex. Thepower of this satellite was noted by Cicero, when he observed that ‘Every monththe moon completes the same trajectory executed by the sun in a year. . . . Itcontributes in large measure to the maturation of shrubs and the growth of ani-mals.’ This helps to explain the important rôle of the lunar goddesses such asIshtar, Hathor, Anaitis, Artemis. Man, from the earliest times, has been aware ofthe relationship between the moon and the tides, and of the more mysteriousconnexion between the lunar cycle and the physiological cycle of woman. Krappebelieves—with Darwin—that this follows from the fact that animal life origi-nated in the watery deeps and that this origin imparted a rhythm to life which haslasted for millions of years. As he observes, the moon thus becomes the ‘Masterof women’. Another essential fact in the ‘psychology of the moon’ is the appar-ent changes in its surface that accompany its periodic phases. He postulates thatthese phases—especially in their negative sense of partial and gradual disappear-ance—may have been the source of inspiration for the Dismemberment myth(Zagreus, Pentheus, Orpheus, Actaeon, and Osiris for example). The same might"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"MOON215be said of the myths and legends of the ‘spinners’ (35). When patriarchy super-seded matriarchy, a feminine character came to be attributed to the moon and amasculine to the sun. The hieros gamos, generally understood as the marriage ofheaven and earth, may also be taken as the union of the sun and the moon. It isgenerally conceded nowadays that the lunar rhythms were utilized before thesolar rhythms as measures of time, and there is also a possible equation with theresurrection—spring follows upon winter, flowers appear after the frost, the sunrises again after the gloom of night, and the crescent moon grows out of the ‘newmoon’. Eliade points to the connexion between these cosmic events and the mythof the periodic creation and recreation of the universe (17). The regulating func-tion of the moon can also be seen in the distribution of the waters and the rains,and hence it made an early appearance as the mediator between earth and heaven.The moon not only measures and determines terrestrial phases but also unifiesthem through its activity: it unifies, that is, the waters and rain, the fecundity ofwomen and of animals, and the fertility of vegetation. But above all it is the beingwhich does not keep its identity but suffers ‘painful’ modifications to its shapeas a clear and entirely visible circle. These phases are analogous to the seasons ofthe year and to the ages in the span of man’s life, and are the reasons for theaffinity of the moon with the biological order of things, since it is also subject tothe laws of change, growth (from youth to maturity) and decline (from maturityto old age). This accounts for the mythic belief that the moon’s invisible phasecorresponds to death in man, and, in consequence, the idea that the dead go to themoon (and return from it—according to those traditions which accept reincarna-tion). ‘Death’, observes Eliade, ‘is not therefore an extinction, but a temporalmodification of the plan of life. For three nights the moon disappears fromheaven, but on the fourth day it is reborn. . . . The idea of the journey to the moonafter death is one which has been preserved in the more advanced cultures (inGreece, India and Iran). Pythagorean thought imparted a fresh impulse to astraltheology: the “Islands of the Blessed” and all mythic geography came to beprojected on to celestial planes—the sun, the moon, the Milky Way. It is notdifficult to find, in these later formulas, the traditional themes of the moon as theLand of the Dead or as the regenerating receptacle of souls. (But) . . . lunar spacewas no more than one stage in the ascension; there were others: the sun, theMilky Way, the “supreme circle”. This is the reason why the moon presides overthe formation of organisms, and also over their decomposition (as the colourgreen). Its destiny consists of reabsorbing forms and of recreating them. Onlythat which is beyond the moon, or above it, can transcend becoming. Hence, for"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"MOON216Plutarch, the souls of the just are purified in the moon, whilst their bodies returnto earth and their spirit to the sun.’ The lunar condition, then, is equivalent to thehuman condition. Our Lady is depicted above the moon, thereby denoting thateternity is above the mutable and transitory (17). René Guénon has confirmedthat, in ‘the sphere of the moon’, forms are dissolved, so that the superior statesare severed from the inferior; hence the dual rôle of the moon as Diana andHecate—the celestial and the infernal. Diana or Jana is the feminine form of Janus(26, 17). Within the cosmic order, the moon is regarded as a duplication of thesun, but in diminished form, for, if the latter brings life to the entire planetarysystem, the moon influences only our own planet. Because of its passive charac-ter—in that it receives its light from the sun—it is equated with the symbolism ofthe number two and with the passive or feminine principle. It is also related to theEgg of the World, the matrix and the casket (9). The metal corresponding to themoon is silver (57). It is regarded as the guide to the occult side of nature, asopposed to the sun which is responsible for the life of the manifest world and forfiery activity. In alchemy, the moon represents the volatile (or mutable) andfeminine principle, and also multiplicity because of the fragmentary nature of itsphases. These two ideas have sometimes been confused, giving rise to literalinterpretations which fall into the trap of superstition. The Greenlanders, forexample, believe that all celestial bodies were at one time human beings, but themoon in particular they accuse of inciting their women to orgies and for thisreason they are not permitted to contemplate it for long (8). In pre-IslamicArabia, as in other Semitic cultures, the cult of the moon prevailed over sun-worship. Mohammed forbade the use of any metal in amulets except silver (39).Another significant aspect of the moon concerns its close association with thenight (maternal, enveloping, unconscious and ambivalent because it is both pro-tective and dangerous) and the pale quality of its light only half-illuminatingobjects. Because of this, the moon is associated with the imagination and thefancy as the intermediary realm between the self-denial of the spiritual life andthe blazing sun of intuition. Schneider has drawn attention to a highly interestingmorphological point with his observation that the progressive change in theshape of the moon—from disk-shape to a thin thread of light—seems to havegiven birth to a mystic theory of forms which has influenced, for example, themanner of constructing musical instruments (51). At the same time, Stuchen,Hommel and Dornseif have demonstrated the influence of the lunar shapes uponthe characters of the Hebrew and Arabic alphabets, in addition to their profoundeffect upon the morphology of instruments.

Theupper world—the world of life and of the nascent sun—is symbolized by a tiger(the monster of darkness and of the new moon) with the human being, repre-sented by a child, emerging from its jaws’ (17). Animals regarded as lunar arethose which alternate between appearance and disappearance, like the amphib-ians; examples are the snail which leaves its shell and returns to it; or the bearwhich vanishes in winter and reappears in spring, and so on. Lunar objects maybe taken as those of a passive or reflecting character, like the mirror; or thosewhich can alter their surface-area, like the fan. An interesting point to note is thatboth objects are feminine in character.Moon, The The eighteenth enigma of the Tarot. It shows an image of themoon dimly lighting up the objects of the world with its uncertain light. Beneaththe moon there is a huge, red crab resting upon the mud. The allegory also showstwo watchdogs guarding the orbit of the sun and barking at the moon. Behindthem, to the left and right, are two castles in the form of square towers, flesh-coloured and edged in gold. The moon is represented by a silvered disk bearing theoutlines of a woman. Long, yellow rays stream out from this disk, intermixedwith other shorter, reddish rays. Inverted drops of water are floating in the air, asif attracted by the moon. It is a scene which illustrates the strength and thedangers of the world of appearances and the imagination. The visionary seesthings in a lunar light. The crab, like the Egyptian scarab, has as its function thatof devouring what is transitory—the volatile element in alchemy—and of con-tributing to moral and physical regeneration. The watchdogs are a warning to themoon to stay away from the realm of the sun (the logos); the towers, on the otherhand, rise up as a warning that the approach to the domain of the moon is besetby very real dangers (the ‘perils of the soul’ of primitive man). As Wirth describesit, behind the towers is a steppe-land, and behind that, a wood (the ‘forest’ as itappears in legends and folklore) full of ghosts. Beyond that there is a mountain(Schneider’s ‘twin-peaked mountain’) and a precipice bordering a stream of puri-fying water. This seems to suggest the route followed by the shamans on theirecstatic journeys. There is another ancient Tarot card depicting a harpist singing,in the moonlight, to a young girl loosening her hair at a window. The image herealludes to the mortal characteristics of the moon, for the harpist is a widespread"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"MOTHER218symbol of death (and of the death-wish), and the girl is unquestionably a symbolof the soul. This Tarot enigma, in sum, seeks to give instruction upon the ‘lunarway’ (of intuition, imagination and magic) as distinct from the ‘solar way’ (ofreason, reflection, objectivity); but at the same, time it is pregnant with negativeand fatal significance. In the negative sense, it alludes to error, arbitrary fantasy,imaginative sensitivity, etc. (59).Mother Mother-symbols are characterized by an interesting ambivalence:the mother sometimes appears as the image of nature, and vice-versa; but theTerrible Mother is a figure signifying death (31). For this reason, Hermetic doc-trine held that to ‘return to the mother’ was equivalent to dying. For the Egyp-tians, the vulture was a mother-symbol, probably because it devours corpses(19); it also stood for the means whereby Hammamit (the universal soul) wassplit up into separate parts to form individual souls (19). For the same reason, thematernal sentiment has been said to be closely bound up with the nostalgiclonging of the spirit for things material (18), or with the subjection of the spirit tothe unformulated but implacable law of destiny. Jung mentions that in JeanThenaud’s Traité de la Cabale (of the 16th century) there is a mother-figureactually represented in the form of a god of destiny (32). He mentions further thatthe Terrible Mother is the counterpart of the Pietà, representing not only deathbut also the cruel side of nature—its indifference towards human suffering (31).Jung also notes that the mother is symbolic of the collective unconscious, of theleft and nocturnal side of existence—the source of the Water of Life. It is themother, he argues, who is the first to bear that image of the anima which the manmust project upon Woman passing from the mother to the sister and finally to thebeloved (32). A predominantly maternal social pattern—a matriarchal society—is characterized, according to Bachofen, by special emphasis upon blood relation-ships, telluric allegiances, and the passive acceptance of natural phenomena.Patriarchies are distinguished by a respect for man-made laws, the favouring ofworks of art and craft, and obedience to the hierarchy (23). Even now thatmatriarchal societies, sociologically speaking, no longer exist in the West, psy-chologically man is nevertheless passing through a phase when he is in all essen-tials dominated by the feminine principle. To come triumphantly through thisstage and to reinstate the masculine principle as the guiding-rule of life—bringingto the fore the characteristically patriarchal qualities noted above—would signifyan achievement of the kind that was once symbolized by the transformation ofthe ‘lunar work’ into the solar, or by the transmutation of mercury into sulphur.To quote Evola: ‘Symbols of the earth-mother are: water, the mother of the"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"MOUNTAIN219waters, stone, the cave, the maternal home, night, the house of depth, and thehouse of strength or of wisdom.’Mound of Earth A sign in the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs in the form ofa rectangle with two sides incomplete. It symbolizes the intermediate stages ofmatter, and is related to the symbols of primordial waters and of slime (19).Mountain The different meanings which have been attached to the symbol-ism of the mountain stem not so much from any inherent multiplicity as from thevarious implications of each of its component elements: its height, verticality,mass and shape. Deriving from the first idea (height) are interpretations such asthat of Teillard, who equates the mountain with inner ‘loftiness’ of spirit (56),that is, transposing the notion of ascent to the realm of the spirit. In alchemy, onthe other hand, the reference is nearly always to the hollow mountain, the hollowbeing a cavern which is the ‘philosophers’ oven’. The vertical axis of the moun-tain drawn from its peak down to its base links it with the world-axis, and,anatomically, with the spinal column. Because of its grandiose proportions, themountain came to symbolize, for the Chinese, the greatness and generosity of theEmperor; it is the fourth of the twelve imperial emblems (5). But the profoundestsymbolism is one that imparts a sacred character by uniting the concept of mass,as an expression of being, with the idea of verticality. As in the case of the crossor the Cosmic Tree, the location of this mountain is at the ‘Centre’ of the world.This same profound significance is common to almost all traditions: suffice it torecall mount Meru of the Hindus, the Haraberezaiti of the Iranians, Tabor of theIsraelites, Himingbjör of the Germanic peoples, to mention only a few. Further-more, the temple-mountains such as Borobudur, the Mesopotamian ziggurats orthe pre-Columbian teocallis are all built after the pattern of this symbol. Seenfrom above, the mountain grows gradually wider, and in this respect it corre-sponds to the inverted tree whose roots grow up towards heaven while its foliagepoints downwards, thereby expressing multiplicity, the universe in expansion,involution and materialization. This is why Eliade says that ‘the peak of thecosmic mountain is not only the highest point on earth, it is also the earth’s navel,the point where creation had its beginning’—the root (18). The mystic sense ofthe peak also comes from the fact that it is the point of contact between heavenand earth, or the centre through which the world-axis passes, binding the threelevels together. It is, incidentally, also the focal point of Inversion—the point ofintersection of the immense St. Andrew’s cross, which expresses the relationshipbetween the different worlds. Other sacred mountains are Sumeru of the Ural-Altaic peoples (17) and Caf in Moslem mythology—a huge mountain the base of"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"MOUNTAIN220which is formed by a single emerald called Sakhrat (8). Mount Meru is said to beof gold and located at the North Pole (8), thus underlining the idea of the Centreand, in particular, linking it with the Pole Star—the ‘hole’ through which all thingstemporal and spatial must pass in order to divest themselves of their worldlycharacteristics. This polar mountain is also to be found in other symbolic tradi-tions, always bearing the same symbolism of the world-axis (25); its mythiccharacteristics were, in all probability, based upon the fixed position of the PoleStar. It is also called the ‘white mountain’, in which case it embraces both thebasic mountain-symbolism with all the implications outlined above and that ofthe colour white (intelligence and purity). This was the predominating character-istic of Mount Olympus (49), the supreme, celestial mountain which Schneidersees as corresponding to Jupiter and equivalent to the principle of the numberone. There is another mountain, relevant to the symbolism of the number two,and that is the mountain of Mars and Janus—that is, as the Gemini; basically,they represent two different aspects of the same mountain, but blending togetherthe symbolism of the ‘two worlds’ of Atma and Buddhi, or the two essential,rhythmic aspects of manifest creation—light and darkness, life and death, immor-tality and mortality. This mountain has two peaks, in order to give visual expres-sion to its dual or ambivalent meaning. It occurs constantly in traditional, mega-lithic culture, particularly in the form of a landscape, illustrating yet again theProtean myth of the Gemini, which bursts out in so many different forms inprimitive thought and art. This mountain is also a form of mandorla consisting ofthe intersection of the circle of the heavens with that of the earth, and thismandorla is, as it were, the crucible of life, containing the opposite poles of life(good and bad, love and hate, fidelity and treachery, affirmation and negation, thenumbers 2 and 11—both equal to one plus one—and finally construction anddestruction). Incidentally, the animals which correspond to this all-embracingsignificance of the mandorla are the whale and the shark (51). In Hindu legend, thecastle of Indra was built on this mountain; whereas in Roman legend it was thecastle of Mars, and the home of the thunderbolt, the two-headed eagle and theGemini. It has been called the ‘mountain of stone’ and is at once the abode of theliving (the exterior of the mountain) and of the dead (the hollow interior) (50).Krappe has borne this out with the observation that ‘The interior of a mountainhas frequently been taken as the location of the Land of the Dead: the derivationof the Celtic and Irish fairy-hills, and of the legend, widespread in Asia andEurope, of a demiurge or hero asleep inside a mountain, one day to emerge andrenew all things sublunar’ (35). This myth has obvious connexions with the mythof Entanglement—of the castle inextricably entangled in a wood and also with the"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"MOUTH221story of the ‘Sleeping Beauty’. All such myths are concerned with the mystery ofa disappearance between appearance and reappearance. Schneider lists the fol-lowing trades and professions as being associated with Mars: those of the king,physician, warrior and miner, as well as the martyr (51). In Western tradition, themountain-symbol appears in the legend of the Grail, as Montsalvat (the ‘moun-tain of salvation’ or ‘of health’)—just as much a ‘polar mountain’ as it is a ‘sacredisland’, according to Guénon; but always it is inaccessible or difficult to find (likethe ‘centre’ of the labyrinth) (28). In general, the mountain, the hill and themountain-top are all associated with the idea of meditation, spiritual elevationand the communion of the blessed. In mediaeval emblems, the symbolism of the‘mountain of salvation’ is further defined by a complementary figure surmount-ing it, such as the fleur-de-lis, the star, the lunar crescent, the cross, steps, thecrown, the circle, the triangle, or the number three. The letter Z sometimes occurs,standing for Zion; similarly, an R is short for Regeneratio (4). Some of thesesymbols have lent themselves to a poetic treatment that is well worth examina-tion. From the moment when the mountain, so to speak, divests itself of itsterrestrial and material character and becomes the image of an idea, the morenumerous the component elements pertaining to this idea, the greater will be itsclarity and force. Hence, mount Meru of India is considered to have the shape ofa pure, seven-sided pyramid (corresponding to the seven planetary spheres, theseven essential virtues and the seven Directions of space) and each face has one ofthe colours of the rainbow. Seen as a whole, the mountain is a shining white, bywhich token it may be equated with the ‘polar mountain’ and the all-embracingimage of totality (also symbolized by the pyramid-symbol), tending towardsOneness (symbolized by the peak)—to avail ourselves of the concepts of Nicho-las of Cusa.Mouth In the symbolism pertaining to the body, the most elementary asso-ciation is the one between the organ or member and its function. It is, then, self-evident that, in Egyptian hieroglyphs, the mouth should stand for the power ofspeech and hence for the creative word. In this sense it stands for the pristineemanation of creative power. Very closely connected with this hieroglyph isanother showing a mouth with a solar disk inside. This disk, primarily standingfor the sun, is connected, but not identical, with the eye. (In hieroglyphs whichare coloured, the eye is wholly blue, while the sign under discussion consists of ablue mouth with a little red circle inside) (19). Guénon supports this interpreta-tion of the sign (29), pointing to the example of the Mândûkya Upanishad where,apropos the state of deep sleep, the mouth is said to represent integral conscious-"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"MUD222ness (26). In the Old Testament, the concepts of mouth and fire are frequentlyassociated; epithets such as ‘devouring’ or ‘consuming’, frequently applied to thelatter, are descriptive of the functions of the former. Hence the fire-breathinganimals of legend. Jung explains these associations by synaesthesia and suggeststhat they are connected with Apollo, the sun-god who is depicted with a lyre ashis characteristic attribute. The common link between the symbolisms of sound-ing, speaking, shining and burning finds a physiological parallel in the phenom-enon known as ‘coloured hearing’ whereby some individuals experience soundsas colours. Furthermore, it is hardly a coincidence that the two main characteris-tics that set Man apart from all other beings are the power of speech and the useof fire. Both are, in fact, the product of mana (psychic energy) (31). In conse-quence, mouth-symbolism, like fire-symbolism, has two aspects: creative (as inspeech) and destructive (devouring). And, of course, the mouth is the point ofconvergence between the external and the inner worlds. This explains the frequentsymbol of the ‘monster’s mouth’, with sets of upper and lower teeth that areexpressive of the ‘interlocking’ of the two worlds: heaven and earth or, moreoften, hell and earth (50). There are, in mediaeval iconography, abundant ex-amples of the mouths of dragons or large fishes affording access to the inner worldor to the underworld.Mud Mud signifies the union of the purely receptive principle (earth) withthe power of transition and transformation (water). Mud is regarded as the typi-cal medium for the emergence of matter of all kinds (17). Plasticity is thereforeone of its essential characteristics, and it is related, by analogy, with biologicalprocesses and nascent states.Multiplicity Given the mystic and emanatistic character of the philosophyof symbolism whereby—as in Neoplatonism—the One is identified with theCreator, it follows that multiplicity must represent the farthest point from theSource of all things. If the image of the circle is taken to express the relationshipbetween unity and multiplicity, then the centre corresponds to unity and theouter circumference or rim relates to multiplicity (as in the Buddhist Wheel ofTransformations) (25). Jung has corroborated this principle from thepsychologist’s point of view, observing that multiplicity is always regressive incharacter, and recalling that when the protagonist of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphiliappears surrounded by a bevy of women, this is an indication of the nature of theunconscious—but of the unconscious revealed as in a state of fragmentation.Hence the Greek maenads, Erinyes, Bacchantes, harpies and sirens all express asituation in which man’s inner wholeness is torn to shreds (32). This is somethingwhich greatly concerned the alchemists, and one part of their work was directed"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"MUSIC223to transforming the volatile (or the transitory and multiple) into the fixed (thestable, or the unified). Another way in which multiplicity is induced is by thecreation of hierarchies. But, in addition to all this, we must note that multiplicity,and its consequence, diversity, may be products of division as well as of multipli-cation. For symbolic purposes, the essence of multiplication is division. As anexample, we might suggest that in contrast to a unitary fruit like the apple, thepomegranate is a perfect illustration of multiplicity because it is internally subdi-vided into a multitude of cells. Hence the negative character of multiplicity, andhence the symbolic doctrine that the totality of the individual has no value untilit has become transmuted—that is, until the individual has destroyed in himselfthe desire for dispersal in space (corresponding to multiplicity) and in time(corresponding to transitoriness) so that ultimately he may be transformed intoan image of the One and so be assimilated into the eternal principle. This is amystic tendency which does not fail to make its mark on the plane of existence,particularly where the moral issues of love are involved. Legends such as that ofthe Flying Dutchman afford a precise illustration of just such a pilgrimage of thespirit in its quest for the unique soul, searching through all those imperfect formsthat lie in its path. The ‘temptations’ of Parsifal likewise correspond to this samesymbolism. Symbolic jewels, when they come to lose their unitary significance as‘treasure’ conceived as an integrated whole, and fall into multiplicity, acquirenegative and distracting implications.Multiplicity of a Common Element A dream that occurs quite often amongcertain abnormal types of subjects involves a multitude—of objects or of people—all with the same characteristics, that is, the multitude comprises the multiplica-tion of one single phenomenon instead of a collection of many different ones.This is a symbol alluding to the secret and, at root, terrible unity of all things.Now, the anguish which nearly always attends this symbol is a psychologicalconsequence of ‘repetition’ (as studied by Kierkegaard) and of the fact that in thisworld it seems to be the law of diversification that prevails. Or, to put it anotherway, diversity justifies multiplicity. Multiple monsters imply the multiplicity oftheir own symbolism as images of disintegration, dissociation, dispersion andseparation. For this reason it is a characteristically pathological symbol.Music The symbolism of music is of the greatest complexity and we cannothere do more than sketch out some general ideas. It pervades all the componentelements of created sound: instruments, rhythm, tone or timbre, the notes of thenatural scale, serial patterns, expressive devices, melodies, harmonies and forms.The symbolism of music may be approached from two basic standpoints: eitherby regarding it as part of the ordered pattern of the cosmos as understood by the"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"MUSIC224ancient, megalithic and astrobiological cultures, or else by accepting it as a phe-nomenon of ‘correspondence’ linked with the business of expression and commu-nication. Another of the fundamental aspects of music-symbolism is its connexionwith metre and with number, arising out of the Pythagorean theory (27). Thecosmic significance of musical instruments—their allegiance to one particularElement—was first studied by Curt Sachs in Geist und Werden derMusikinstrumente (Berlin, 1929). In this symbolism, the characteristic shape ofan instrument must be distinguished from the timbre, and there are some common‘contradictions’ between these two aspects which might possibly be of signifi-cance as an expression of the mediating rôle of the musical instrument and ofmusic as a whole (for an instrument is a form of relationship or communication,substantially dynamic, as in the case of the voice or the spoken word). Forexample, the flute is phallic and masculine in shape and feminine in its shrill pitchand light, silvery (and therefore lunar) tone, while the drum is feminine by virtueof its receptacle-like shape, yet masculine in its deep tones (50). The connexionof music-symbolism with self-expression (and even with graphic art) is well inevidence in primitive music-making, which often amounted to almost literal imi-tations of the rhythms and movements, the features and even the shapes ofanimals. Schneider describes how, hearing some Senegalese singing the ‘Song ofthe Stork’, he began to ‘see as he was listening’, for the rhythm correspondedexactly to the movements of the bird. When he asked the singers about this, theirreply confirmed his observation. Given the laws of analogy, we can also findcases of the expressive transferred to the symbolic: that is, a melodic progressionas a whole expresses certain coherent emotions, and this progression correspondsto certain coherent, symbolic forms. On the other hand, alternating deep and high-pitched tones express a ‘leap’, anguish and the need for Inversion; Schneiderconcludes that this is an expression of the idea of conquering the space betweenthe valley and the mountain (corresponding to the earth and the sky). He ob-serves that in Europe the mystic designation of ‘high music’ (that is, high-pitched)and ‘low music’ (low-pitched) persisted right up to the Renaissance. The ques-tion of relating musical notes to colours or to planets is far from being as certainas other symbolic correspondences of music. Nevertheless, we cannot pass onwithout giving some idea of the profound, serial relationship which exists inphenomena: for instance, corresponding to the pentatonic scale we usually findpatterns grouped in fives; the diatonic and modal scale, since it has seven notes,is related to most of the astrobiological systems, and is unquestionably the mostimportant of all the series; the present-day tendency towards the twelve-noteseries could be compared to the signs of the Zodiac. But, so far, we have not"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"MUSICIAN225found sufficient evidence for this particular facet of musicsymbolism. All thesame, here are the correspondences as set down by Fabre d’Olivet, the Frenchoccultist: Mi—the Sun, fa—Mercury, sol—Venus, la—the Moon, ti—Saturn,do—Jupiter, re—Mars (26). A more valid series of relationships, at least in theexpressive aspect, is that which links the Greek modes with the planets and withparticular aspects of the ethos, as follows: the mi-mode (the Dorian)—Mars(who is severe or pathetic); the re-mode (the Phrygian)—Jupiter (ecstatic): thedo-mode (the Lydian)—Saturn (pained and sad); the ti-mode (the Hypodorian)—the Sun (enthusiastic); the la-mode (the Hypophrygian)—Mercury (active); thesol-mode (the Hypolydian)—Venus (erotic); the fa-mode (the Mixolydian)—theMoon (melancholy) (50). Schneider’s profound investigations into the symbol-ism of music seem to us well-founded. The tetrachord formed by the notes do, re,mi, fa, he considers, for instance, to be a mediator between heaven and earth, thefour notes corresponding respectively to the lion (signifying valour and strength),the ox (sacrifice and duty), man (faith and incarnation) and the eagle (elevationand prayer). Conversely, the tetrachord formed by sol, la, ti, do, could representa kind of divine duplicate of the previous tetrachord. Fa, do, sol, re are regarded asmasculine elements corresponding to the Elements of fire and air and to theinstruments of stone and metal, whereas la, mi, ti, are feminine, and pertain to theElements of water and earth. The interval fa-ti, known to musicologists as atritone (or augmented fourth), expresses with its dissonance the ‘painful’ clashbetween the Elements of fire and water—a clash occurring in death itself (50). Wehave been able to suggest here only a few outlines of the music-symbolismdeveloped by Schneider in his work The Musical Origin of Animal-Symbols, thescope of which is so wide that, as he has privately intimated to us, he believes allsymbolic meanings are at root musical or at least to do with sounds. This becomeseasier to understand when we recall that singing, as the harmonization of succes-sive, melodic elements, is an image of the natural connexion between all things,and, at the same time, the communication, the spreading and the exaltation of theinner relationship linking all things together. Hence Plato’s remark that the char-acter of a nation’s music cannot be altered without changing the customs andinstitutions of the State (26).Musician The musician is a common symbol of the fascination of death(personified by the Greeks as a youth). The Pied Piper of Hamelin in the well-known tale, the harpist and the citharist in legends and folktales, all allude to thisone symbol. Music represents an intermediate zone between the differentiated ormaterial world, and the undifferentiated realm of the ‘pure will’ of Schopenhauer.Hence its use in rites and liturgies (together with fire and smoke)."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"NAMES226NNames In esoteric thought, names are an integrating expression of the horo-scope (49). There has been a great deal of speculation about the symbolic ele-ments entering into the composition of names: letters in their graphic or phoneticaspects, similes, analogies, and so on. Piobb, for instance, has suggested that thename Napoleon is Apollo in the Corsican pronunciation of O’N’Apolio (48). Thequestion of why a given name should determine the destiny of one individual butnot of another is something which lies beyond the scope of this work. Here wemust limit ourselves to describing the rational basis of the symbolism of namesand its connexion with the Egyptian idea of the ‘power of words’ (as described ina poem by Edgar Allan Poe). Given the symbolic nature of the Egyptian language,it follows that a name could never be a product of chance but only of the study ofthe characteristics of a given thing, whether the name in question was common orproper. The name RN (signifying a mouth over the surface of water) representedthe action of the ‘word’ upon passivity. Concerning personal nomenclature, theEgyptians believed that their names were a reflection of their souls. This gave riseto the belief that a name could have a magical effect upon some other person. Theequation of name with character (and destiny) had its repercussions also in de-scriptive names, such as that of Osiris, which means ‘he who is at the top of thesteps’ (the steps, that is, of evolution); or that of Arabia, signifying ‘he whowalks in silence’. Onomatopoeia was another highly important source in thegenesis of language and its ideographic representation, whereby a given being ischaracterized by one of its essential aspects—as the lion by its roar, for example:or RW in Egyptian (19). Popular works on occultism which suggest symbolicimplications for certain proper names, as in other cases of vulgarized interpreta-tion, have some roots in authentic symbolism but they may also fall into the trapof being too hard-and-fast about the true scope of symbolism. Language has, inthe last century or two, reached such a complex stage of development that theapplied symbolism of etymology is subject to innumerable errors.Narcissus Joachim Gasquet sees the Narcissus-myth as a primordial illus-tration not on the sexual but on the cosmic level, commenting that ‘the world is animmense Narcissus in the act of contemplating itself’, so that Narcissus becomesa symbol of this, self-contemplative, introverted, and self-sufficient attitude (quotedby Bachelard, 2)."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"NEPTUNE227Nature The 12th-century writer Alan of Lille, in his De planctu naturae,describes Nature as an allegorical figure wearing a diadem set with jewels inimitation of the stars: twelve stones symbolize the signs of the Zodiac and sevenstand for the Sun, the Moon and the five planets (14). This concept is whollyastrobiological in character, since it partakes of the tendency to bring the disci-pline of numbers to bear upon living things, and to infuse the astral, the mineraland the abstract with the vital forces of plant and animal life.Necklace Broadly speaking, the threaded bead-necklace stands for the uni-fying of diversity, that is, it represents an intermediate state between the inherentdisintegration of all multiplicity—always a negative state—and the state of unityinherent in continuity. Regarded as a string, the necklace becomes a cosmic andsocial symbol of ties and bonds. Because it is usually worn on the neck or breast,it acquires a symbolic relation with those parts of the body and with the signs ofthe Zodiac pertaining to them. Since the neck has an astrological association withsex, the necklace also betokens an erotic link.Negro The image of the Negro always alludes to the baser part of man—tothe substrata of the passions. This psychological fact, empirically proven bypsychoanalysis, finds its parallel—or its origin—in traditional symbolic doc-trine, according to which coloured people are the children of darkness and thewhite man is the child of the sun or of the white, polar mountain (49).Neptune In primitive thought, he was the deity of heaven in its symbolicaspect of the ‘Upper Waters’, that is, the god of clouds and of rain. Later hebecame the god of fresh and fertilizing water. Finally, he was seen as the god of thesea. In this development we can trace not only a chronological and historical lineof progress but, more especially, a spiritual projection of the myth of the ‘fall’,which finally became absorbed into the character of Neptune. The trident, seenfrom this point of view of ‘descent’—of the ‘fall’—can be equated with thethunderbolt. Charles Ploix, in La Nature et les dieux, on the other hand, identifiesthe trident with the magic wand used in water-divining (2). For the alchemists,Neptune was quite simply a symbol for water. Apart from the trident, his at-tributes are sea-horses (8), signifying the cosmic forces and the swelling rhythmof the foamy waves. The discovery of psychoanalysts that the ocean is a symbolof the unconscious has, at the same time, proved beyond question the relation-ship of Neptune with the deepest layers of the individual, and the universal, soul.Diel, therefore, is able to conclude that Neptune, like Pluto, symbolizes thenegative aspect of the spirit. He is king of the deeps of the subconscious and ofthe turbulent waters of life; it is he who unleashes storms—representing thepassions of the soul—particularly in his extreme rôle as the destroyer. Diel"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"NET228regards the trident as an emblem of the threefold sin arising from the corruption ofthe three ‘vital impulses’ of the spirit (conservation, reproduction and evolution),adding that the trident is also an attribute of Satan (15).Net The net is the extreme form of expression of the symbolic bunch ofribbons, the bow and the bond, and hence it is closely bound up with the symbol-isms of Entanglement and Devouring. It is the weapon of the Uranian gods, suchas Varuna (18) and of those who fish in the waters of the unconscious. Ea, god ofwater and wisdom, did not fight the primordial monsters face to face but ensnaredthem by craft. The weapon of Marduk in his combat with Tiamat was again a net,a symbol of magic authority (17). The connexion between the net and heaven isexplained in the following passage taken from the Tao Te Ching: ‘The net ofheaven’, that is, the network of stars and constellations, ‘is wide-meshed but letsnothing through’ (58). The symbolism here strikingly illustrates the idea that it isnot possible for the individual, by his own efforts (nor, of course, by suicide), toescape from the universe. God has bound us with his power and it is beyond ourcapacity to withdraw or leave.Night Night is related to the passive principle, the feminine and the uncon-scious. Hesiod gave it the name of ‘mother of the gods’, for the Greeks believedthat night and darkness preceded the creation of all things (8). Hence, night—likewater—is expressive of fertility, potentiality and germination (17); for it is ananticipatory state in that, though not yet day, it is the promise of daylight. Withinthe tradition of symbology it has the same significance as death and the colourblack.Night-Sea Crossing This expression, frequent in works of symbology,originates in the ancient notion of the sun, in its nightly course through the lowerabyss where it suffers death (which is sometimes conceived as a real death fol-lowed by resurrection, and at other times as purely figurative). This abyss wasassociated with the watery deeps of the third—or infernal—level, either in thesense of a lower ocean or of a subterranean lake. According to Leo Frobenius, inDas Zeitalter des Sonnengottes, all the sea-faring gods are solar symbols. For theirpassage they are shut up in a chest, hamper or trunk (symbolizing the maternalbosom) and exposed to a variety of perils. The direction of their journey isalways contrary to the visible, daily course of the sun. Here is the account givenby Frobenius of the archetypal avatars of this essential journey: ‘A hero isswallowed by a-sea-monster in the West. The animal journeys with him in itsbelly to the East. During the journey, the hero lights a fire in the belly of themonster and, feeling hungry, cuts off a slice of its heart. Shortly afterwards heobserves that the fish has reached land; he then begins to cut away the flesh of the"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"NOTHINGNESS229animal until he can slip out. In the belly of the fish it was so hot that his hair fellout. Often the hero sets free those who have been swallowed before him and theyescape with him’ (31). This basic situation takes on a variety of forms in a greatmany legends and folktales, but the essential features of devouring, confinement,enchantment and escape are always present. For Jung, this symbol is a kind ofJourney into Hell comparable with the journeys described by Virgil and Dante,and also a sort of journey to the Land of Spirits, or, in other words, a plunge intothe unconscious (33). But he goes on to add that darkness and watery deeps, inaddition to being symbolic of the unconscious, also signify death—not in thesense of total negation but as the other side of life (or life in its latent state) and asthe mystery which exerts its fascination over the consciousness from its abode inthe abyss. The journey’s end is expressive of resurrection and the overcoming ofdeath (and the same applies to the end of a dream or of an illness). Related insymbolism to this is the story of Joseph cast into the pit by his brothers, andJonah in the belly of the whale (32) (Plate XXX).Nothingness The Upanishads laid down several different states of con-sciousness, ranging from wakefulness—peopled by objective forms—or day-dreams—ordered in accordance with profound, subjective impulses—to the deep-est state of consciousness experienced in dreams of the most intense character,devoid of images. This latter state is directly related to the mystic idea of nothing-ness. In order properly to grasp the notion of Nirvana, and to understand theecstasy of self-annihilation, it is very important to recognize that this oriental‘nothingness’ is not absolute negation—not the death of all things—butindifferentiation or, in other words, the absence of conflicts and contrasts andhence, the banishment of pain and dynamism. Guénon, in his explanation of thisHindu doctrine, comments: ‘In this state the different objects of manifestation,including those of individual manifestation, external as well as internal, are notdestroyed, but subsist in principal mode, being unified by the very fact that theyare no longer conceived under the secondary or contingent aspect of distinction;of necessity they find themselves among the possibilities of the Self and the latterremains conscious in itself of all these possibilities, as “non-distinctively” beheldin integral Knowledge’ (26). This concept of nothingness as ‘non-objective real-ity’—and hence ineffable—probably reached the Hebrew mystics by way of theMiddle East and Persia. According to Rabbi Joseph ben Shalom, living in Barcelonain the 13th century, more than to any other of the symbolic descriptions of therevelation of God, special attention should be devoted to that concerning themystic nothingness, which is apparent in every abysmal crevice of existence. Hesuggests that in each transformation of reality, in each crisis, or moment of suffer-"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"NUDITY230ing, each metamorphosis or change of form, or on every occasion when the stateof a thing is altered, then the abyss of Nothingness is spanned and made visiblefor a mystic instant, for nothing can change without making contact with thatregion of absolute being which the oriental mystics call Nothingness (the relevantpassage is quoted by G. G. Scholem in Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism). Thereis a Cabbalistic anagram which serves to corroborate this by demonstrating that‘nothing’ in Hebrew is Ain, and that the same letters form the word for ‘I’—Ani.Nudity The distinction between nuditas virtually (purity and innocence) andnuditas criminalis (lasciviousness and vain exhibition) was already clearly estab-lished by Christians in the Middle Ages. Hence every nude must always have anambivalent meaning and imply an ambiguous emotion: on the one hand, it liftsone’s thoughts towards the pure peaks of mere physical beauty and (in a Platonicsense) towards the understanding of, and identification with, moral and spiritualbeauty; but, on the other hand, it can never lose altogether its all too humanballast—its irrational attraction rooted in urges beyond the control of the con-scious mind. Clearly, the human form revealed, whether in nature or in art, in-duces either one attitude or the other in the contemplator.Numbers In symbolism, numbers are not merely the expressions of quanti-ties, but idea-forces, each with a particular character of its own. The actual digitsare, as it were, only the outer garments. All numbers are derived from the numberone (which is equivalent to the mystic, non-manifest point of no magnitude). Thefarther a number is from unity, the more deeply it is involved in matter, in theinvolutive process, in the ‘world’. The first ten numbers in the Greek system (ortwelve in the oriental tradition) pertain to the spirit: they are entities, archetypesand symbols. The rest are the product of combinations of these basic numbers(44). The Greeks were much preoccupied with the symbolism of numbers.Pythagoras, for example, observed that ‘Everything is disposed according to thenumbers’. Plato regarded number as the essence of harmony, and harmony as thebasis of the cosmos and of man, asserting that the movements of harmony ‘are ofthe same kind as the regular revolutions of our soul’ (24). The philosophy ofnumbers was further developed by the Hebrews, the Gnoptics and the Cabbalists,spreading to the alchemists as well. The same basic, universal notions are foundin oriental thought—Lao-tse, for example: ‘One becomes two; two becomesthree; and from the ternary comes one’—the new unity or new order—’as four’(Maria Prophetissa) (32). Modern symbolic logic and the theory of groupings goback to the idea of the quantitative as the basis for the qualitative. Pierce suggeststhat the laws of nature and of the human spirit are based on these same principles,and that they can be ordered along these same lines (24). Apart from the basic"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"NUMBERS231symbols of unity and multiplicity, there is another general symbolism attached tothe even numbers (expressing the negative and passive principle) and the unevennumbers (the positive and active). Furthermore, the numerical series possesses asymbolic dynamism which it is essential not to overlook. The idea that oneengenders two and two creates three is founded upon the premiss that everyentity tends to surpass its limits, or to confront itself with its opposite. Wherethere are two elements, the third appears as the union of the first two and then asthree, in turn giving rise to the fourth number as the link between the first three,and so on (32). Next to unity and duality (expressing conflict, echo and primor-dial duplication), the ternary and the quaternary are the principal groupings; fromtheir sum comes the septenary; and from their multiplication the dodecanary.Three is the more direct derivation of seven (since both are uneven) and four moreclosely related to twelve (both being even numbers). The usual symbolisms are asfollows: The ternary represents the intellectual or spiritual order; the quaternarythe terrestrial order; the septenary the planetary and moral order; the dodecanarythe universal order. Here now are the most generally accepted symbolic meaningsof each number, which will serve as a basis for a brief summary of the psychologi-cal theory of Paneth.Zero Non-being, mysteriously connected with unity as its opposite and itsreflection; it is symbolic of the latent and potential and is the ‘Orphic Egg’.

It is the active principle which, broken into fragments, gives rise tomultiplicity (43), and is to be equated with the mystic Centre (7), the IrradiatingPoint and the Supreme Power (44). It also stands for spiritual unity—the com-mon basis between all beings (55). Guénon draws a distinction between unity andone, after the Islamic mystic thinkers: unity differs from one in that it is absoluteand complete in itself, admitting neither two nor dualism. Hence, unity is thesymbol of divinity (26). One is also equated with light (49).Two Two stands for echo, reflection, conflict and counterpoise orcontraposition; or the momentary stillness of forces in equilibrium (43); it alsocorresponds to the passage of time—the line which goes from behind forward (7);it is expressed geometrically by two points, two lines or an angle (44). It is alsosymbolic of the first nucleus of matter, of nature in opposition to the creator, ofthe moon as opposed to the sun (55). In all esoteric thought, two is regarded asominous (9): it connotes shadow (49) and the bisexuality of all things, or dualism(represented by the basic myth of the Gemini) in the sense of the connecting-linkbetween the immortal and the mortal, or of the unvarying and the varying (49).Within the mystic symbolism of landscape in megalithic culture, two is associ-ated with the mandorla-shaped mountain, the focal point of symbolic Inversion,forming the crucible of life and comprising the two opposite poles of good andevil, life and death (51), Two, then, is the number associated with the MagnaMater (51).Three Three symbolizes spiritual synthesis, and is the formula for the cre-ation of each of the worlds. It represents the solution of the conflict posed bydualism (43). It forms a half-circle comprising: birth, zenith and descent (7).Geometrically it is expressed by three points and by the triangle (44).

The hieros gamos is signified by the numberfive, since it represents the union of the principle of heaven (three) with that ofthe Magna Mater (two). Geometrically, it is the pentagram, or the five-pointedstar (44). It corresponds to pentagonal symmetry, a common characteristic oforganic nature, to the golden section (as noted by the Pythagoreans) (24), and tothe five senses (55) representing the five ‘forms’ of matter.Six Symbolic of ambivalence and equilibrium, six comprises the union of thetwo triangles (of fire and water) and hence signifies the human soul. The Greeksregarded it as a symbol of the hermaphrodite (33). It corresponds to the sixDirections of Space (two for each dimension) (7), and to the cessation of move-ment (since the Creation took six days). Hence it is associated with trial and effort(37). It has also been shown to be related to virginity (50), and to the scales.Seven Symbolic of perfect order, a complete period or cycle. It comprises theunion of the ternary and the quaternary, and hence it is endowed with exceptionalvalue (43). It corresponds to the seven Directions of Space (that is, the sixexistential dimensions plus the centre) (7), to the seven-pointed star, to thereconciliation of the square with the triangle by superimposing the latter upon theformer (as the sky over the earth) or by inscribing it within. It is the numberforming the basic series of musical notes, of colours and of the planetary spheres(55), as well as of the gods corresponding to them; and also of the capital sins andtheir opposing virtues (41). It also corresponds to the three-dimensional cross(38), and, finally, it is the symbol of pain (50).Eight The octonary, related to two squares or the octagon (44), is the interme-diate form between the square (or the terrestrial order) and the circle (the eternalorder) and is, in consequence, a symbol of regeneration. By virtue of its shape, thenumeral is associated with the two interlacing serpents of the caduceus, signify-ing the balancing out of opposing forces or the equivalence of the spiritual powerto the natural (55). It also symbolizes—again because of its shape—the eternallyspiralling movement of the heavens (shown also by the double sigmoid line—thesign of the infinite) (9).

From ancientoriental thought through the Pythagorean school and right up to St. Jerome, it wasknown as the number of perfection (50).Eleven Symbolic of transition, excess and peril and of conflict and martyrdom(37). According to Schneider, there is an infernal character about it: since it is inexcess of the number of perfection—ten—it therefore stands for incontinence(50); but at the same time it corresponds, like two, to the mandorla-shapedmountain, to the focal point of symbolic Inversion and antithesis, because it ismade up of one plus one (comparable in a way with two) (51).Twelve Symbolic of cosmic order and salvation. It corresponds to the numberof the signs of the Zodiac, and is the basis of all dodecanary groups.

There are two ways inwhich this fusion may occur: either by mystic addition (for example,374=3+7+4=14=1+4=5) or by succession, in which case the right-hand digitexpresses the outcome of a situation denoted by the left-hand number (so 21expresses the reduction of a conflict—two—to its solution—unity). These num-bers also possess certain meanings drawn from traditional sources and remotefrom their intrinsic symbolism: 24, for example, is the sacred number in Sankhyaphilosophy, and 50 is very common in Greek mythology—there were fiftyDanaides, fifty Argonauts, fifty sons of Priam and of Aegyptus, for example—asa symbol, we would suggest, of that powerful quality of the erotic and humanwhich is so typical of Hellenic myths. The repetition of a given number stresses"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"NUMBERS235its quantitative power but detracts from its spiritual dignity. So, for example, 666was the number of the Beast because 6 was regarded as inferior to seven (37).When several kinds of symbolic meaning are contained within a multiple number,the symbolism of that number is accordingly enriched and strengthened. Thus,144 was considered very favourable because its sum was 9 (1+4+4) and becauseit comprises multiples of 10 and 4 plus the quaternary itself (37). Dante, in theDivine Comedy, has frequent recourse to the symbolism of numbers (27).The work of Ludwig Paneth upon numbers concerns not so much symbolismas such, but rather the normal interpretation of numbers from the psychologist’spoint of view as they appear in obsessions and dreams of average people. Hisconclusions are as follows:One rarely appears, but where it does occur it alludes to the paradisiac statewhich preceded good and evil—which preceded, that is to say, dualism.Two signifies counterpoise, or man’s experience of separate existence, withits concomitant problems, inevitable analysis, dividing up, inner disintegrationand struggle.Three stands for biological synthesis, childbirth and the solution of a conflict.Four, as a kind of double division (two and two), no longer signifies separa-tion (like the number two) but the orderly arrangement of what is separate.Hence, it is a symbol of order in space and, by analogy, of every other well-ordered structure. As Simonides, the Greek poet, observed: ‘It is difficult tobecome a superior man, tetragonal in hand, foot and spirit, forming a perfectwhole.’Five is a number which often occurs in animate nature, and hence its trium-phant growth corresponds to the burgeoning of spring. It signifies the organicfullness of life as opposed to the rigidity of death. There is an erotic sense to it aswell.Six is, like two, a particularly ambiguous number: it is expressive of dualism(2 × 3 or 3 × 2). However, it is like four in that it has a normative value as opposedto the liberating tendencies of five and the mystic (or conflicting) character ofseven.Seven is, like all the prime numbers, an irreducible datum, and an expressionof conflict or of a complex unity (the higher the prime number the greater thecomplexity). It is sometimes associated with the moon (since 7 × 4=the 28 daysof the month).Te n, in its graphic form as 10, is sometimes used to express marriage.Nought, as the decimal multiplier, raises the quantitative power of a numeri-cal symbol. A number of repeated noughts indicates a passion for grand things."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"NUMBERS236General Characteristics of Numbers Paneth draws a distinction between thearithmetical number and the symbolic number: the former defines an object by itsquantity but says nothing about its nature, whereas the latter expresses an innerlink with the object it defines by virtue of a mystic relationship between what isenumerated and the number itself. In arithmetic, the addition of 1 and 1 and 1gives 3, but not triunity; in symbolism the second and third of these ones areintrinsically different from the first because they always function within ternaryorders which establish the first term as an active element, the second as passiveand the third as neuter or consequent. Aristotle spoke of the ‘qualitative struc-ture’ of the numbers as opposed to the amorphous character of the arithmeticalunity. Concerning the higher numbers, Paneth has this to say: ‘The multiplicationof a number simply increases its power: thus, 25 and 15 are both symbols oferoticism. Numbers composed of two digits express a mutual relationship be-tween the individual digits (reading from left to right). For example, 23=2 (con-flict) and 3 (the outcome).’ Numbers made up of more than two digits may bebroken down and analysed in a number of different ways. For example, 338 mayequal 300 plus 2 × 19, or else 3 and 3 and 8. The dynamism and symbolic richnessof the number three is so exceptional that it cannot be over-emphasized. Thereconciling function of the third element of the ternary, we would add, mayappear in either a favourable or an adverse light. For instance, when in myths andlegends there are three brothers or sisters, three suitors, three trials, three wishes,and so on (42), the first and second elements correspond broadly to what isalready possessed, and the third element represents the magic or miraculoussolution desired and sought after; but this third element may—as we have said—also be negative. Thus, just as there are legends where the first and the second failand the third succeeds—sometimes it is the first six followed by the successfulseventh—so there are others where the inversion of the symbolism produces theopposite result: the first two are favourable (and the second usually more so thanthe first) but then comes the third which is destructive or negative. The ThreeKings, for example, offer the Infant Jesus gifts of gold, frankincense (both posi-tive) and myrrh (negative). In almost all those myths and tales about three chal-ices, three chests or three rooms, the third element corresponds to death, becauseof the asymmetrical division of the cycle of man’s life, composed of two partswhich are ascending (infancy-adolescence, youth-maturity) and the third and lastwhich is descending (old age-death). There is a Hebrew tale, called ‘True Happi-ness’, which exactly expresses the symbolic significance of this ‘third element’.Here it is in Loeffler’s exemplary version: ‘A peasant and his wife, dissatisfiedwith their lot, envied those who dwelt in palaces, imagining their existence to bean unending flow of delights. While he was working in the fields, the man came"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"NUMISMATIC SYMBOLS237across three iron chests. On the first was an inscription which said: “He whoopens me will become rich.” On the second he read: “If gold makes you happy,open me.” On the third: “He who opens me, loses all that he possesses.” The firstchest was at once opened up and with the silver it contained the couple gave asumptuous banquet, purchased splendid garments and slaves. The contents ofthe second chest enabled the couple to discover the luxury of refined living. Butwith the opening of the third, a terrible storm destroyed all their belongings’ (38).The symbolism bears a relationship to the asymmetrical cycle of the year (Spring—Summer—Autumn followed by Winter) and to all symbols of the ‘superior’—for superiority is always perilous.Finally, there are also visual interpretations of number-symbols, derived fromthe shape of the digits; but such interpretations are of a specialized nature and arenot always well-founded.Numismatic Symbols Coins have, from Antiquity, had a certain talismanicmeaning, gradually lost with the passing of time: the power of a city, of a king, ofa magistrate. Symbols, signa (ensigns), allegories and personifications have beenstamped on them, clearly reflecting the cultural ethos of the day. Swastikas,tripods, tridents, labyrinths, chariots, winged horses, roses, tortoises, eagles,griffins, shields, crowns, bulls, cornucopias, etc., are frequently found on Greekcoins. And on Roman coinage: military trophies, signa (standards) of the legions,ships’ prows, heads of gods (especially double-headed Janus), eagles, votivecrowns, chariots, temples, etc. It is worth noting that from the 4th to the 2ndcenturies B.C. in the coinage of Luceria (Apulia) there appear geometric symbolssuch as ovals, triangles and series of dots, alongside Jupiter’s thunderbolts, andalso the cross-potent as it was later to appear in the Christian escutcheon ofJerusalem. Strictly speaking, mediaeval coinage dates from Carolingian times anddisplays crosses, anagrams, triple enclosures and very schematic temples. Byz-antine coins are characterized above all by emperors’ heads and figures of Christ,the Virgin and saints, as well as crosses and schematic ladders or steps. Mediaevalcoinage in the West has a wide range of motifs, embracing various forms of cross,triple enclosures, roses, fleurs-delis, crowns, angels, armed knights, swords, handsraised in benediction, castles and shrines, lions, eagles, etc. On the reverse side ofsome coins there are veritable mandalas formed by the juxtaposition of lobularenclosures, circles and crosses. From Renaissance times onwards, money, bynow secularized, takes on the standardized characteristics of Imperial Rome,with the face of a monarch on the obverse and heraldic shields on the reverse. Butin many of the more imaginative stampings symbolic implications are still to befound in the form of ‘wild men’, solar symbols, religious or alchemical themes,etc. Islamic coins are usually based on calligraphy, but they sometimes portray"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"NYMPHS238stars, figures and conjunctions of the square and the circle. Another topic, alle-gorical rather than symbolic, but nevertheless of great beauty, is found on medi-aeval gold pieces and portrays the king standing, sword in hand, on a ship. Ahistory of numismatic motifs in geography and in chronology has yet, we believe,to be written.Nymphs The Greek word vun means ‘bride’ and also ‘doll’. The nymphsaccompanying some of the mythic deities are symbolic of the concomitant ideasof those deities (48). According to Mircea Eliade, nymphs correspond in essenceto running water, fountains, springs, torrents and waterfalls. The best known ofthe nymphs are the sisters of Thetis, the Nereides, who figure in the expedition ofthe Argonauts. By virtue of their association with the Element of water, theirsignificance is ambivalent and they may preside equally over birth and fertility ordissolution and death (17). Jung, from the psychological standpoint of his theoryof individuation, regards the nymph as an independent and fragmentary expres-sion of the feminine character of the unconscious. He concludes, therefore, thatwhat Paracelsus called the regio nymphidica corresponds to a relatively undevel-oped stage of the process of individuation, a stage which he relates to the notionsof temptation, transitoriness, multiplicity and dissolution (32).OOak A tree sacred to Jupiter and Cybele, standing for strength and long life.Hercules’ club, according to legend, was made of oak (8). Its consecration toJupiter may derive from the ancient belief that the oak tree attracts the lightningmore than any other. The oak had this symbolic and allegorical meaning through-out the Aryan cultures of Russia, Germany, Greece and Scandinavia (17). Like alltrees, it represents a world-axis.Oar In ancient rites connected with the founding of temples, the king wouldmake the round of the site, an oar in his hand. Virgil mentions this ceremony inconnexion with the rebuilding of Troy. It is a symbol of creative thought and theWord, the source of all action (19).Obelisk A symbol of the sun-ray, by virtue of its shape. Because of itssubstance, it is bound up with the general symbolism of stone. It is further related"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"OBJECT239to the myths of solar ascension and of light as the ‘penetrating spirit’, in conse-quence of its upright position and the pyramidal point in which it terminates.Object The symbolism of objects varies with the kind of object in question.But, broadly speaking, every object consists of a material structure with certainunconscious elements adhering to it (31). The fact that these forgotten or re-pressed constituents should reappear in a new medium—the object—enables thespirit to accept them in a form different from the original. Utensils in particularare possessed of a mystic force which helps to strengthen the intensity and therhythm of human volition. Thus, Schneider maintains that such instruments fulfila triple rôle: they are cultural instruments, instruments of labour and finallyreflections of the harmonious soul of the universe. The drinking-vessel, for in-stance, is a sacrificial vessel and also a drum. The blow-pipe is both a flute and amagic whistle, etc. (50). Such ideas as these, concerned with the primitive notionof an object, have lately been resuscitated by artistic movements such as Dadaismand surrealism. By depicting objects in common use as if they were works of art,Marcel Duchamp removed them from the context of their merely utilitarian func-tion (their only function according to Western ways of thinking) and showedthem in the light of their true essence, since that essence is revealed only in theiruselessness (freed from the necessity to serve some useful purpose). He showedthat it was possible to see in a bottle-stand, for instance, the very mystic struc-ture that governed the Gothic spires rising in the form of a cage, or the lamps inIslamic mosques with their multiple, descending hoops; and that all the foregoingare related to the hollow pyramid of the Primitives (a symbol of the ‘conjunction’of earth—or the mother—with fire—or the spirit), and also to the artificial moun-tain and the geometric temple. The form of the object, then, fulfils an essentialrôle in determining the symbolism; thus, all those symbols which take the form ofa twin bell, with the upper bell placed upside down on the lower—for example,the twin drum or the hour-glass—are closely related to the corresponding graphicsymbol: the letter X, or the cross of St. Andrew (symbolic of the intercommuni-cation between the Upper and the Lower Worlds). Objects that are simple in formand function usually correspond either to the active or to the passive groups; inother words, they represent either the contents or the receptacle. For instance:the lance (which is made to pierce) and the cup or chalice (whose sole function isto contain). The parallel between this classification and the division of the sexesis self-evident; but to limit the symbolic relevance of a given object to this sexualimplication is to mutilate seriously its true symbolism. The ‘conjunction’ of thefeminine and masculine principles within a complex object, specially if this objectis—as in the case of a machine—endowed with movement, enables us to carry the"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"OBJECT240sexual parallel a stage further and to characterize it as a kind of secularized lingam.The ‘objects of symbolic function’ of the surrealists were nothing but the practi-cal illustration of this allusive reality, strengthened by the fetishistic character ofthe objects illustrated in their compositions. It was Lautréamont in Les Chants deMaldoror who best described this shifting of the symbolic significance of objectstowards their generic grouping in his remark: ‘beautiful as the chance-finding of anumbrella and a sewing-machine on a dissecting table’. As always, a symbol ofintegration such as this can be taken either on the cosmic plane or at the existentialand sexual level. In the latter case, the umbrella would be a merely phallic repre-sentation, the machine would stand for the cteis, and the dissection-table wouldbe an illustration of the bed. On the cosmic plane, the umbrella is the cosmicserpent, the machine is the jaguar, and the table is the universe. At the same time,objects owe part of their significance to their origins: objects fallen from heaven,such as aerolites and meteorites for example, partake of the sacred character ofUranus and constitute a symbol of the power of the celestial deities (17). Subma-rine objects, on the other hand, possess a viscous and abysmal quality betokeningtheir irrational nature and their aptness for the expression of all that is base andunconscious. Sacred objects are so by virtue of their associations—as in the caseof attributes or emblems for instance, or their origins—such as the legendarypalladium of Troy, the Salian shields of Rome, the Hebrew Ark of the Covenant,etc. (28). To come back now to the broadest of generalizations, alongside theirspecific symbolism deriving from their form, function, character, origin, colourand so on, objects in themselves are always symbols of the world: that is, they areparticular expressions of a material order which expounds both the blind irratio-nal force of continuity and the structural pattern defining the object as opposedto the subject. Finally we would mention that an elaborate application of thetheory of correspondences would demonstrate the serial structure of objects andsuggest a way of reconciling their ‘character’ with the principles governing thetwo essential prototypes of the serial arrangement of the universe: that basedupon the number seven, or the planetary prototype; and twelve, or the zodiacalmodel. The incomplete character of such forms of symbolic expression has beenapparent to man since the earliest times, and for this reason the attempt was madeto discover objects which could be invested with great symbolic power by meansof the combination and juxtaposition of various ingredients, which were usually‘noble’ in character, but were occasionally bizarre or even base—as was the case,for example, with the alchemic preparation known as ‘prime matter’. The aimwas to endow the object with all the powers inherent in the several planes ofcosmic reality. An example of a ‘complete object’ of this kind is the sword in the"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"OCEAN241Grail legend: its pommel was a precious stone of many colours, each colourrepresenting a particular virtue; its haft was composed of the bones of strangebeasts.Objects, Marvellous Objects which are marvellous because of their rarity,beauty, splendour, or magical or miraculous qualities, frequently appear in myths,legends, folktales and books of knighterrantry. They are invincible weapons,talismans; on another plane, however, they are also purely and simply works ofart, giving pleasure to their owner. The ‘marvellous objects’ par excellence arerelics, or the ancestral symbols which sometimes become identified with them:the Grail, the bleeding lance, the Celtic cauldron, etc. Occasionally, the marvellousobject is the motive for a symbolic ‘test’, such as the Sphinx’s question toOedipus; this is the case with the broken sword, which, in the legends of theRound Table, is given to Gawain and Parsifal for mending, and which Siegfriedsuccessfully achieves in the Niebelungen.Ocean According to Piobb, the Graeco-Roman conception of the oceanencompassing the earth was a graphic representation of the current of energyinduced by the terrestrial globe (48). Setting aside its grandeur, the two mostessential aspects of the ocean are its ceaseless movement and the formlessness ofits waters. It is a symbol, therefore, of dynamic forces and of transitional statesbetween the stable (or solids) and the formless (air or gas). The ocean as a whole,as opposed to the concept of the drop of water, is a symbol of universal life asopposed to the particular (38). It is regarded traditionally as the source of thegeneration of all life (57), and science has confirmed that life did in fact begin in thesea (3). Zimmer observes that the ocean is ‘immense illogic’—a vast expansedreaming its own dreams and asleep in its own reality, yet containing within itselfthe seeds of its antitheses. The island is the opponent of the ocean and symbolicof the metaphysical point of irradiating force (60). In keeping with the generalsymbolism of water, both fresh and salt, the ocean stands for the sum of all thepossibilities of one plane of existence. Having regard to its characteristics, onemay deduce whether these potentialities are positive (or germinant) or negative(destructive) (26). The ocean, then, denotes an ambivalent situation. As the be-getter of monsters, it is the abysmal abode par excellence, the chaotic sourcewhich still brings forth base entities ill-fitted to life in its aerial and superiorforms. Consequently, aquatic monsters represent a cosmic or psychological situ-ation at a lower level than land-monsters; this is why sirens and tritons denote asub-animal order. The power of salt water to destroy the higher forms of land-lifemeans that it is also a symbol of sterility, so confirming the ambivalent nature of"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"OCTAGON242the ocean—its contradictory dynamism (32). The ocean is also to be found as asymbol of woman or the mother (in both her benevolent and her terrible aspects)(56). As Frobenius comments in Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes: ‘If the blood-redsunrise is interpreted as the “birth” of an astral body, then two questions arise:Who is the father? And how did the mother come to conceive? And since she, likethe fish, is a sea-symbol, and since our premiss is that the sun plunges into the seaand yet is born in it, the answer must be that the sea previously swallowed up theold sun and the appearance of a “new sun” confirms that she has been fecundated.The symbolism here coincides with that of Isis whose twin lunar horns embracethe sun.’ This appearance of the sun and its disappearance back into the deeps ofthe ocean confirm that the ‘Lower Waters’ signify the abyss out of which formsarise to unfold their potentialities within existence. Thus, the ocean is equatedalso with the collective unconscious, out of which arises the sun of the spirit (32).The stormy sea, as a poetic image or a dream, is a sign of an analogous state in thelower depths of the affective unconscious. A translucent calm, on the other hand,denotes a state of contemplative serenity.Octagon Embellishments, architectonic structures, and different disposi-tions based on the octagon (in ground-plan or elevation in the case of a building orstructure such as a baptistry, fountain, etc.) symbolize spiritual regeneration,because the eight-sided figure is connected with this idea as the intermediarybetween the square and the circle. It is not surprising, therefore, that the majorityof baptistries have a definite octagonal shape. However, twelve is sometimesused for baptismal fonts (the sum of the facets of the semi-polyhedron), becauseit symbolizes totality.Octopus It has the same significance as the dragon-whale myth (31). As adecorative motif it appears most frequently in Cretan art. It is related to thespider’s web and the spiral, both being symbolic of the mystic Centre and of theunfolding of creation. It has also been credited with a merely existential signifi-cance (41).Ogre The origins of the ogre, a common feature in legend and folklore, goback to Saturn, who would devour his children as soon as Cybele gave them birth(38). If the core of the Saturn-myth is the idea that destruction is the inevitableoutcome of creation (since creation takes place in time), then the ogre seems to bea personification of the ‘Terrible Father’. Henri Dontenville derives the word‘ogre’ from the definition of the Latin poet Ennius: Pluto latine est Dis Pater, aliiOrcum vacant. Orcus was the lord of the underworld, with his mother Orca, andboth are characterized by the Saturnian practice of eating little children (16).

According to Caro Baroja, the Ojancanu is regarded as a giant with red hair(and therefore Satanic), tall and stout, with one bright and evil-looking eye. If twoeyes are an expression of normality, and three denote the superhuman (as in thecase of Shiva), a single eye is a clear allusion to what is base. The Cyclops-mythappears in different versions throughout Europe and Asia Minor, but it is notknown in the Far East (10). The Ojancanu is, in sum, a symbol of the evil anddestructive forces behind the primary or regressive side of Man.Old Man In the Cabala, the Old Man is the symbol of the occult principle(like the holy or silver palace). In the modern study of symbols, the Old Man isregarded as the personification of the age-old wisdom of humanity, or of thecollective unconscious. The Old Men (Elders) of the Apocalypse are the twelveprophets and the twelve apostles. The ‘Ancient of Days’ is a similar symbol,sometimes identified with the creative principle, the Cabbalistic Ain-Soph and theAtum of Egyptian religion (19). According to Jung, the Old Man, particularlywhen invested with special powers or prestige, is the symbol of the ‘mana’personality, i.e. the spirituality of the personality which emerges when con-sciousness is overburdened with clarified, apprehended and assimilated matterwelling up from the unconscious (30).Olive Tree A symbol of peace, consecrated by the Romans to Jupiter andMinerva. It carries the same symbolic significance in many oriental and Europeancountries (8).Omphalos To quote Pausanias (X, 16, 2): ‘What the inhabitants of Delphicall omphalos is made of white stone and is considered to be at the centre of theearth’, and Pindar, in one of his odes, confirms this opinion. It is, then, one of themany symbols of the cosmic ‘Centre’ where intercommunication between thethree worlds of man, of the dead, and of the gods, is effected (17). W. H. Roscher(according to René Guénon) collected a number of documents in a work entitledOmphalos (1913) which prove that this symbol was in existence among the mostdiverse of races. By locating it in one particular spot, man made of it a sacred zonearound the ‘centre of the world’. The material image of the Omphalos (the ‘navel’in Greek) was known as the Bethel, which was made of stone and shaped like apilaster. It has been suggested that the menhir may have had a similar significance.Another image of the omphalos may have been the ovoid stone as it sometimesappears in Greek designs encircled by a snake or serpent.

More abstract and therefore spiritu-ally superior ways of depicting this ‘Centre’ (at once cosmic, temporal andspatial, physical and metaphysical) are to be found in China: the hole in themiddle of the disk of jade known as Pi, for instance, where the centre is identifiedas the non-being of mystic Nothingness, or the quadrangular pyramid rising up inthe centre of each feudal domain where each face of the pyramid corresponds toone of the cardinal points and the summit represents the centre. These pyramidswere also known in Ireland, according to J. Loth in his Brehon Laws (28).One The number one is equivalent to the ‘Centre’, to the non-manifest point,to the creative power or the ‘unmoved mover’. Plotinus equates one with moralpurpose, and multiplicity with evil—a distinction which is in complete accordwith symbolist doctrine.Orchestra Symbolic of the activity of a corporate whole. This is the ideabehind Schneider’s remark that when the high and the low orchestras (that is,heaven and earth) perform the counterpoint of the cosmos, these two antitheticalvoices are ‘descanting’. But when one of the voices imposes its own rhythmupon the other, then that voice is ‘enchanting’ its opponent (50).Orgy Orgies, characterized by drunkenness, sexual licence, excesses of allkinds and occasional transvestism, always correspond to a ‘call to chaos’ as aresult of a weakening of the will to accept the norm in the ordinary way. Hence,as Eliade has pointed out, the orgy is a cosmogonic equivalent of Chaos and ofsupreme, ultimate fulfilment, as well as of the eternal moment and of timeless-ness. The Roman Saturnalia—whose origins go back to prehistoric times—orCarnival were expressions of the orgiastic urge. In these uninhibited festivities thetendency is to ‘confuse forms’ by means of the inversion of the social pattern, thejuxtaposition of opposites and the unleashing of the passions—even in theirdestructive capacity. All this is a means not so much towards pleasure as to bringabout the dissolution of the world in a momentary disruption—although themoment seems definitive while the orgy lasts—of the reality-principle, alongsidethe corresponding restoration of the primigenial illud tempus (17).Orientation In Islamic thought, orientation is the materialization of intent.The Orient, since it is the point where the sun rises, symbolizes illumination andthe fount of life; to turn towards the east is to turn in spirit towards this spiritualfocal point of light. Orientation plays its due part in rites and ceremonies all overthe world, particularly in those to do with the founding of temples and cities. Theorientation of Graeco-Latin temples and mediaeval churches was inspired by the"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"ORNAMENTATION245same idea (28). However, not all mystic orientations take the east as their pointof reference: there is an alternative point in the geography of the sky, symbolic ofthe ‘hole’ in space-time and of the ‘unmoved mover’—and that is the North Star.The Etruscans located the abode of the gods in the north, and hence their sooth-sayers, when about to speak, would turn to face the south—that is, they wouldtake up a position which identified them, ideologically, with the gods (7). To facethe north is to pose a question. To turn westwards is to prepare to die, because itis in the watery deeps of the west that the sun ends its journey. The notion oforientation, taken in conjunction with the concept of space as a three-dimensionalwhole, plays a powerful part in the symbolic organization of space. The humananatomy itself, with its quasi-rectangular, symmetrical and bilateral pattern, indistinguishing between the front and the back thereby designates two corre-sponding points of orientation. The natural position of the arms and shoulderscompletes this quadrangular scheme—a symbolic pattern which, interpreted ac-cording to strictly anthropological and empirical criteria, would perhaps provideus with the key to the original conception of orientation as quaternary on thesurface but septenary three-dimensionally (embracing north, south, east and west,together with the zenith, the nadir and the centre). Also closely linked with thesymbolism of the cardinal points and orientation are the gestures and movementsof the body, as symbolic expressions of the will applying itself in one direction oranother. All attitudes of concentration denote the enshrining of the ‘Centre’ withinthe heart.Ornamentation This is a symbol of cosmic activity, of development inspace and of the ‘way out of chaos’ (chaos being denoted by blind matter) (13).Ornamentation by virtue of graduated motifs—its progressive reconciliation withorder—signifies the gradual stages in this evolutive development of the universe.The principal elements in ornamentation are the spiral, the sigma, the cross,waves, the zigzag; these are discussed in their appropriate place. Some of thebasic principles behind these ornamental motifs concern graphic and spatial sym-bolisms. Negatively speaking, the art of ornamentation is opposed to figurativeart, particularly when the ornaments are geometric forms or stylizations of plants.‘Beware of representation, whether it be of the Lord or of man, and paint nothingexcept trees, flowers and inanimate objects’; so spoke Mohammed according tothe oral traditions or Hadith. For Moslems, consequently, art is a kind of aid tomeditation, or a sort of mandala—indefinite and interminable and opening outonto the infinite, or a form of language composed of spiritual signs, or handwrit-ing; but it can never be a mere reflection of the world of existence.

Patterns such as these are blendedinto a vast symbolic network reminiscent of polyphonic music and the aspirationtowards the harmony of infinity (6). In figurative ornamentation—Romanesquefor instance—every item represented possesses its own symbolic sense, whilethe pattern as a whole constitutes a veritable symbolic syntax.Ouroboros This symbol appears principally among the Gnostics and isdepicted as a dragon, snake or serpent biting its own tail. In the broadest sense, itis symbolic of time and of the continuity of life (57). It sometimes bears thecaption Hen to pan—’The One, the All’, as in the Codex Marcianus, for instance,of the 2nd century A.D. It has also been explained as the union between thechthonian principle as represented by the serpent and the celestial principle assignified by the bird (a synthesis which can also be applied to the dragon). Rulandcontends that this proves that it is a variant of the symbol for Mercury—theduplex god. In some versions of the Ouroboros, the body is half light and halfdark, alluding in this way to the successive counterbalancing of opposing prin-ciples as illustrated in the Chinese Yang-Yin symbol for instance (32).

Poison, the viperand the universal solvent are all symbols of the undifferentiated—of the ‘un-changing law’ which moves through all things, linking them by a common bond.Both the dragon and the bull are symbolic antagonists of the solar hero. Theouroboros biting its own tail is symbolic of self-fecundation, or the primitive ideaof a self-sufficient Nature—a Nature, that is, which, à la Nietzsche, continuallyreturns, within a cyclic pattern, to its own beginning. There is a Venetian manu-script on alchemy which depicts the Ouroboros with its body half-black (sym-bolizing earth and night) and half-white (denoting heaven and light).Oven or Furnace A mother-symbol. The alchemists’ crucible is symbolic ofthe body, and the alembic is expressive of the vas Hermetis (31). But it has afurther significance as a symbol of pure, spiritual gestation; it is in this sense thatthe glowing furnace makes its appearance in so many alchemic treatises, such asMichael Maier and the Museum Hermeticum (1678).Oviparous Animals In India, birds, reptiles and all oviparous beings receivethe name of ‘twice born’. With this in mind we can conclude that the laying of theegg is equivalent to the birth of man, and the breaking out from the egg symbolizeshis second birth or initiation (18).Owl In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, the owl symbolizes death,night, cold and passivity. It also pertains to the realm of the dead sun, that is, ofthe sun which has set below the horizon and which is crossing the lake or sea ofdarkness (19).Ox Broadly speaking, the ox is a symbol of the cosmic forces (40). In Egyptand in India, a more specialized symbolism was evolved for the ox, contrasting itwith the lion on the one hand and with the bull on the other. For obvious reasonsit became a symbol of sacrifice, suffering, patience and labour. In Greece and inRome it was regarded as an attribute of agriculture and of foundation-laying (andso, by extension, was the yoke). Roman generals who had been granted thehonour of a triumph would sacrifice white oxen to the Capitoline Jupiter as partof the ceremony (8). In Herrad of Landsberg’s Hortus Deliciarum, the moon’schariot is drawn by oxen (14), which points to the emasculated character of theanimal (14). In mediaeval emblems, the ox is frequently found symbolizing pa-tience, submissiveness and the spirit of self-sacrifice (20). Very often the ox-head, without its body, is shown with one of the following signs between itshorns: a crown, a snake coiled round a staff, a chalice, a circle, a cross, a fleur-de-lis, a crescent moon or the Gothic ‘R’ (standing for Regeneratio) (4). The ox"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"PALACE248(because of its connexion with the moon) is also a symbol of darkness and nightin contrast to the lion, which is a solar animal (50).PPalace In Cabbalistic symbolism, the sacred palace, or the ‘inner palace’, islocated at the junction of the six Directions of Space which, together with thiscentre, form a septenary. It is, consequently, a symbol of the occult Centre—ofthe ‘unmoved mover’ (28). It is also known as the ‘silver palace’, the ‘silverthread’ being the hidden bond which joins man to his Origin and to his End (28).This concept of the Centre embraces the heart and the mind; hence, in legends andfolktales, the palace of the old king contains secret chambers (representing theunconscious) which hold treasure (or spiritual truths). Loeffler suggests thatpalaces made of glass or of mirrors, and also those which suddenly appear as if bymagic, are specially symbolic of the ancestral memories of mankind—of thebasic, primitive awareness of the Golden Age (38).Palafitte The architectural pillar and lintel owe their origin to the palafitte orlake-dwelling. Paul Sarrasin has shown that the classic Greek temple derivesdirectly from lacustrine structures (22). The palafitte came about not just becauseof topographical necessity but as a consequence of motives of a mystic order: theurge to raise one’s dwelling above the general level. Now, lake-dwellings acquiregreater symbolic interest still by virtue of their connexion with three of theElements: earth, since the lake-dwelling is a home—and the home is alwaysassociated in turn with the cave and the mountain; air, since it is elevated; andwater, because the piles which support it are immersed in this Element. Thepalafitte is, then, a symbol of the world: it is both the Tree of Life and a mysticvessel, for its ‘masts’ touch the water, and its roof, sickle-shaped, is representa-tive of the mandorla (q.v.)

She is also at times a representation of the irrational, wildtendencies of the imagination.Pansy In Spanish,(1) this flower is called ‘thought’ precisely because it isthought which it symbolizes by virtue of its clearly pentagonal pattern: five beingthe number that symbolizes man (48).Papyri In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, a rolled papyrus is a determi-native sign defining the concept of knowledge. The fact that the papyrus is rolledsignifies progress, efflorescence and omniscience. The unfolding of life itself isalso symbolized by a roll of papyrus, though more frequently by a mat or carpet;in the words of Themistocles to Artaxerxes: ‘Human life is like a rolled-up carpetslowly unfolding’, an idea which Stefan George incorporated in one of his poems.In every case the symbolic significance corresponds not so much to the object ormaterial in question as to the process of its manifestation (19).Paradise Lost Symbolic of the mystic ‘Centre’—or, rather, of its manifesta-tion in space. The Chinese locate it in central Asia, referring to it as a gardeninhabited by ‘dragons of wisdom’, with the four essential rivers of the world—the Oxus, Indus, Ganges and Nile—rising out of a common source which istermed the ‘lake of the dragons’ (9). Leaving aside the Christian dogma, there area host of Western and oriental legends dealing with the lost Paradise. It is found insymbolic traditions all over the world, and it is here that its true beginnings shouldbe looked for. As a symbol of the spirit, it corresponds to that state which isabove all queries and quibbles. The fall of man from the paradisiac state and hisreturn to it find varied manners of symbolic expression, the most characteristicbeing the labyrinth. As Saunier has observed: ‘When man comes to ponder thismysterious problem, he knows no more peace, for his mind, faced with a series ofinsurmountable obstacles, is shattered, filling his heart, his soul and his body withrage and despair. . . . Man, urged on by his desire . . . bent his mind to a rigorousinvestigation into the smallest particles of the cosmos, enshrined his intelligencein matter, and strove by hard and constant work to rediscover himself in the1Pensamiento in Spanish is the common name for ‘thought’ and the popular word for ‘pansy’.

Only once he had grasped the worlds of the infinitely smalland the infinitely large could man once again vibrate in sympathy with the cosmicharmonies and blend in ineffable communion with all the beings and things inearth and heaven’ (49). The ‘weekly day of rest’ is a temporal image of Paradise,comparable with the Islands of the Blessed and El Dorado, etc., in geographicalsymbolism. The ‘lost’ characteristic, which gives the symbol of Paradise itsparticular symbolic direction, is connected with the general symbolism of thefeeling of abandonment and fall, recognized by modern existentialism as an essen-tial part of human make-up.Parakeet Related to other members of the parrot family in its faculty forpronouncing words. Maurice Bouisson, in Le Secret de Schéhérazade (Paris,1961), comments on the Tuti nameh, a Persian translation of Nakchabi’s Book ofthe Parrot. He comes to the conclusion that it is a messenger-symbol, like thecrow, and also a symbol of the soul (the Egyptian ba), like other birds. In TheConference of the Birds, by the 13th-century Persian poet Farid Ud-Din Attar,the parrot seeks the water of immortality.Partridge The partridge is very common in Romanesque ornamentation—inthe southern gallery of the cloister at Silos, for instance. Pinedo has noted howAristotle, Theophrastus, Pliny and other ancient and mediaeval writers all havesomething to say about the characteristic habit of the partridge, succinctly ex-pressed by St. Jerome as follows: ‘Just as the partridge lays eggs and hatchesyoung birds who will never follow it, so the impious man possesses wealth towhich he is not entitled, and which he must leave behind when he is least inclined.’It is this idea that underlies the symbol of the partridge. Another symbolic func-tion comes from the bird’s capacity for deception. In the words of St. Ambrose:‘The partridge, taking its name from the word perdendo and in Hebrew calledkore (to call and shout), is Satan tempting the multitudes with his voice’ (46).Paste According to Bachelard, the notion of matter is very closely related tothat of paste. Water is here a predominant constituent, imparting cohesion. Henceit has been said that ‘matter is the unconscious of form’. Mud is the ‘dust’ ofwater, just as ash is the ‘dust’ of fire. Bachelard goes on to suggest that mud, dustand smoke afford images which, in a changed and shadowy form, imply thematter from which they arise—they are the residue of the four Elements (2).They correspond to a quasi-aquatic state, and hence come into the symbolisms ofdissolution and regeneration: ash and dust are expressive of an ending, but all endsare beginnings."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"PELICAN251Peacock On Roman coins, the peacock designates the apotheosis of prin-cesses, just as the eagle does of victors (8). The peacock’s tail, in particular,appears in the eighty-fourth emblem of the Ars Symbolica of Bosch as a symbolfor the blending together of all colours and for the idea of totality (32). Thisexplains why, in Christian art, it appears as a symbol of immortality (20) and ofthe incorruptible soul (6). The common motif of the two peacocks symmetricallydisposed on either side of the Cosmic Tree or hom—a feature which came toIslam from Persia and subsequently reached Spain and the West—denotes thepsychic duality of man (related to the myth of the Gemini) drawing its life-forcefrom the principle of unity (6). In the mystic horology, the peacock correspondsto dusk (50). In Hindu mythology, the patterns on its wings, resembling innumer-able eyes, are taken to represent the starry firmament (50).Pearl One of the eight ‘common emblems’ of Chinese tradition. It symbol-izes ‘genius in obscurity’ (5), doubtless after the rather less categorical observa-tion of Lao-tse that, ‘Hence, the chosen one wears coarse garments, but in hisbreast he hides a precious stone’—by allusion to the pearl hidden inside itsoyster. Because of all this, psychoanalysts have recognized that the function ofthe pearl is to represent the mystic Centre and sublimation (seen here as thetransfiguration of an infirmity, or of some abnormality) (56). The Moslems oftenhave recourse to the pearl as a symbol of heaven, since their belief is that theblessed are enclosed in a pearl, each one with his houri (46); there is an obviousconnexion here with Plato’s androgynous ‘spherical man’ who is both primordialand final. They also believe—and this confirms the parallel with the Platonicspherical man—that the pearl is the product of the ‘conjunction’ of fire and water.It has also been identified as the human soul (18). Pearls in large numbers take ona different character: despite their high value, they come to be mere beads: whenjoined they correspond to the symbol of the necklace, and when scattered theyrelate to the symbol of dismemberment, like all things that are dispersed.Pegasus A winged horse which sprang from the blood of Medusa, theGorgon, when Perseus cut off her head with the aid of the magic weapons givenhim by the gods.

Whereas the pure, cold airof mountain heights is associated with heroic and solitary thought—in St. John ofthe Cross quite as much as in Nietzsche—a scent-laden atmosphere is expressiveof the mind saturated with emotion and with nostalgia. The over-enthusiasticapplication of the laws of correspondences has led some people to lay downhard-and-fast symbolisms for every particular smell. It is feasible, however, topick out some of the basic and characteristic significances attaching to particularsmells and to arrange them in serial order so that they constitute a scale of valuesequivalent to those of colours, textures, shapes and all phenomena that are char-acterized by both continuity and discontinuity and that express the graduateddifferentiations of Oneness.Persephone A personification of earth and of spring. The myth tells how thegoddess was gathering flowers when the earth opened up and Pluto, the god of theunderworld, appeared and carried her off to be his queen in hell. Her mother,Demeter, obtained this concession—that Persephone should spend two-thirds ofthe year with her (spring to autumn) and only one-third with her ravisher (win-ter). Folklore in many European countries preserves the archetypes of Persephoneand Demeter in the figures of the ‘Harvest Maiden’ and the ‘Mother of the Corn’(21).Personification This may be defined as the attribution of human propertiesto an object, and as the embodying of an idea. The urge to personify objects orideas is a peculiar characteristic of mythic thought, but it played a particularlyimportant part during the period from the latter days of pre-history up to the riseof Christianity, which was the age of elaboration and crystallization of abstractideas. Personification results from a synthesis of animism and of the anthropo-morphic view of the world. The Ancients personified the great themes of destiny(life, death, good, evil), of the cosmic and elemental entities (heaven, earth, ocean,rivers, springs), man’s emotions and impulses (fear, laughter, love and desire), thevirtues (fortune, liberty, constancy, victory, fecundity), the collective entities(town or city) and the cultural fields (history and astronomy). These themescame to constitute allegories once certain symbolic elements and attributes hadaccrued to them, so giving formal expression to their inherent reality or adapting"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"PHOENIX253irrational nature to more intelligible forms in which human conversation—theoriginal form of analytic thought—was feasible. It hardly needs to be said thatmythological deities can be explained, in part, as products of personification—apart, that is to say, from the fact that they correspond to the basic truths, to thebasic ‘series’, and to the diversified meaning, of the universe.Petrifaction The myth of Deucalion, who made men out of stones, as wellas lithophany, find their inversion in legends about petrifaction. This is clearly aquestion of the antithetical tendencies of evolution and involution. To petrify isto detain or to enclose. The glance of Medusa the Gorgon, so it was said, wassufficient to turn men to stone. There are many folktales and mediaeval legendswhich tell of similar cases of petrifaction or enchantment. Fairies, sometimes,instead of sending people to sleep—although the symbol is the same—turn themto stone and leave them looking like statues. In Beauty and the Beast, the twowicked sisters of the heroine are turned into statues. The words the author putsinto the mouth of the good fairy illuminate the symbolic meaning: ‘Become twostatues, but retain your reason beneath the stone which envelops you. You shallstay by the door of your sister’s palace and I shall inflict no other punishmentupon you but to require you to witness her happiness. You may not return toyour original state until you recognize the error of your ways’ (38). Petrifaction,then, is the detention of moral progress—of the evolution of the soul. Sin forcesthis spiritual evolution from its proper course and, even if it does not plunge intothe abyss, at least it arrests (‘petrifies’) and stagnates it. This is what happens inthe case of Lot’s wife, and this is the peril which Ulysses resolutely surmounts inhis journey back to Ithaca (a symbol of the celestial homeland—of eternityassuming the aspect of temporal existence).Phallus A symbol for the perpetuation of life, of active power and of thepropagation of cosmic forces (57).Pheasant Similar in symbolism to the cock. In China, it was the allegoricalanimal of light and of day (17).Phoenix A mythical bird about the size of an eagle, graced with certainfeatures of the pheasant. Legend has it that when it saw death draw near, it wouldmake a nest of sweet-smelling wood and resins, which it would expose to the fullforce of the sun’s rays, until it burnt itself to ashes in the flames. Another phoenixwould then arise from the marrow of its bones (8). Turkish tradition gives it thename of Kerkés, and Persian Simurgh. In every respect it symbolizes periodicdestruction and re-creation (38). Wirth suggests a psychological interpretation ofthe fabulous bird as a symbol of the ‘phoenix’ which we all keep within ourselves,enabling us to live out every moment and to overcome each and every partialdeath which we call a ‘dream’ (59) or ‘change’. In China, the phoenix is the"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"PHONETICS254emperor of birds and a sun-symbol (5). In the Christian world, it signifies thetriumph of eternal life over death (20). In alchemy, it corresponds to the colourred, to the regeneration of universal life (57) and to the successful completion ofa process.Phonetics We quote the definition of phonetic symbolism as it appears inthe Rituale mitriaco, bearing the stamp of traditional Egyptian ideas mentioned inthe Book of the Dead: ‘And the word, which is fundamentally an acoustic phe-nomenon, has greater value as a sound than as an expression of an idea, since thesound contained in it, and emanating from it as certain given vibrations, is themodulation of the cosmic breath; to sound a word, tuning it in, as it were, to thevaried rhythms of the cosmos, is tantamount to restoring its elemental power’(11). Hindu tradition often alludes to the meaning, as sound, of letters, syllablesand words. So, for example, the sound of each letter of the words Makara andKumara is given a precise value as part of the general meaning of the word: thetrilled ‘r’ is onomatopoeic, alluding to thunder as the symbol of creative power (itis for this reason that most verbs in almost all languages contain the letter ‘r’), andthe syllable ‘Ma’ refers to matter, etc. (40). The tradition is that the entire essenceof the universe is contained in the syllable ‘Om’ (or Aum) of the Hindu or Tibetanlanguages: A = the beginning, U = transition, M = the end, or deep sleep. Thismystic belief in the power of phonetics per se led the Gnostics and the followersof Mithras to insert passages entirely devoid of any literal sense into parts oftheir ritual chants, as a kind of symbolic music effective only by virtue of thepower of their phonetic significance.Phrygian Cap In part it is a phallic symbol. The fact that, being an item ofheadgear, it corresponds in symbolism to the head, ensures that its significancewill embrace eroticism in its superior and sublimated—and at times obsessive—form. Hence, the Trojan Paris, being a pure type of Venusian man, who is des-tined in times of fortune and misfortune always to be at the mercy of Eros, isdepicted with a Phrygian cap. Its red colour may also imply a sacrificial signifi-cance—either of self-immolation (as in the case of Cybele’s priests) or of theimmolation of others (as in the case of the French revolutionaries in 1789). Inprinciple, every red bonnet has a similar meaning. The cap worn by the VenetianDoge (il corno) is a stylized version of the fisherman’s bonnet—for the dignitaryand the fisherman are symbolically alike—and, like the Phrygian cap, ends in apoint.Physical Processes Changes or transformations in matter may afford asymbolic significance comparable with the marks used by Rorschach in his tests.It was, in fact, upon the symbolism pertaining to processes of elaboration of‘prime matter’ that the alchemists founded their entire practice, since they as-"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"PINE-TREE255pired to pass beyond the stages of combination of mercury with sulphur in orderto produce, not the aurum vulgi, but the philosophers’ gold; all of which is a clearindication of the spiritual nature of alchemy or, in other words, of its affinity withsymbolism. As René Alleau has said, ‘the material technique was only an appren-ticeship, preparing the neophyte for the understanding of truths’. If we were totake works of art and ignore the material result, we would then see the genesis ofthe artist’s work as a long process of self-education and of groping towards theideals of truth and beauty.Pictorial Image Every pictorial creation gives rise to an image, either imi-tated or invented, figurative or non-figurative. In any such image, alongside thesymbolic significance attached to the subject or figure, there are also implicationsarising from the spatial distribution, the colours, the inclusion or absence ofgeometric shapes, the signs, predominant axes, rhythms, composition and tex-ture. In the most recent, so-called ‘informalist’ style of art, the expression andsymbolization is realized primarily by means of texture and line-rhythm, colourbeing of secondary significance. In order to grasp the ‘meaning’ of any particularwork, it is first necessary to classify its component elements and to estimate thesignificance of each class of such components according to their prominencewithin the pictorial whole. Exactly the same is true of architecture and sculpture.Pilgrim The concept of man as a pilgrim and of life as a pilgrimage is commonto a great many peoples and traditions (4), for it accords with the great myth ofthe celestial origin of man, of his ‘fall’ and his hopes of being restored to thecelestial realm, since the effect of all this is to make him something of a strangerduring his stay on earth and to imprint the mark of the transitory upon his everystep. Man leaves and returns to his place of origin—exitus and reditus. It isprecisely this view of life as a pilgrimage that lends the Christian pilgrimage itsspecial value (14). The following are the attributes associated with the symbol-ism of the pilgrim: the shell, the crook or staff, the well of the water-of-salvationwhich he finds in his path, the road, the cloak, etc. The idea is cognate with thatof the labyrinth: to go on a pilgrimage is to come to understand the nature of thelabyrinth, and to move towards the mastery of it as a means to the ‘Centre’.Pillar The solitary pillar is related to the world-axis, as are the post, the mastand the tree. The Egyptian hieroglyphic sign zed is interpreted both as a pillar andas the spinal column (there is no symbolic contradiction here) (39). Frobeniussays that Africans interpret pillars as caryatids shorn of their human likeness,that is, as indirect images of man (21). When there are two pillars, the symbolismcorresponds to that of the cabbalistic columns of Jachin and Boaz.Pine-tree Like other evergreen trees, the pine is a symbol of immortality.Conifers, by virtue of their shape, also partake of the symbolism corresponds to"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"PISCES256that of the Cabbalistic columns of Jachin sacred tree, associating it with the cultof Attis. Pine-cones were regarded as symbols of fertility (4, 21).Pisces The last sign of the Zodiac, closely bound up with the symbolism ofwater and of the ‘dissolution of forms’ which takes place in the Akasha. Neptunewhipping up the waves with his trident, and calling forth bulls and horses out ofthem, is a symbolic expression of the resurgence of cosmic energy from thewatery deeps of the primordial ocean. If Capricorn marks the beginning of theprocess of dissolution, Pisces denotes the final moment which, for this veryreason, contains within itself the beginning of the new cycle. Related to Pisces arethe avatar in the form of the fish of Vishnu in India, and the Chaldean myth ofOannes the man-fish. This twelfth house of the Zodiac, when transposed, byanalogy, to the existential and psychic plane, denotes defeat and failure, exile orseclusion, and also mysticism and the denial of the self and its passions (40). Thedual aspect of this symbol is well expressed by the zodiacal sign itself, composedof two fishes arranged parallel to one another but facing in different directions: theleft-hand fish indicates the direction of involution or the beginning of a new cyclein the world of manifestation, while the fish that faces the right points to thedirection of evolution—the way out of the cycle (52).Plait Like bunches of ribbons, rosettes, ties and knots, the plait is symbolicof intimate relationship, intermingling streams and interdependence (19).Planetary Gods They are personifications of idealized qualities of Man:‘modes’ of existence and the range of the essential possibilities in behaviour andknowledge. Since these gods are endowed with enviable powers and disportthemselves upon a delectable field of action, they have come to symbolize thetriumph of the particular principle pertaining to each one of them; hence theyfrequently appear in mythology in association with ideas of justice and theunderlying laws governing life (15). Through the process of catasterism, themajor gods were projected into the heavens and identified with the sun, the moonand the five nearest planets. This can be clearly seen in the beginnings of astrobio-logical thought (7) in Mesopotamia. For the Chaldeans, the astral bodies wereZodiacal signof Pisces."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"PLANETS257living but divine beings, an idea which persists in clear though fragmentary formin Aristotle and throughout the Middle Ages in the Western world, as Seznec hasshown (53). The respective names of the gods among the Chaldeans, the Greeksand the Romans were these: Shamash, the Sun, Helios, Apollo; Sin, the Moon,Artemis, Diana; Marduk, Zeus, Jupiter; Ishtar, Aphrodite, Venus; Nabu, Hermes,Mercury; Nergal, Ares, Mars; Ninib, Cronos, Saturn. By virtue of the theory ofcorrespondences, the relationships stemming from these gods embrace the whole—or almost the whole—of the pattern of the universe.Planets The planets constitute a particular order within the cosmos. It is thebusiness of the science of astronomy to study them from a naturalistic andmathematical point of view, upon the basis of the system which Copernicusestablished with his De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium of 1543, according towhich the sun is the centre around which are set the orbits of the planets: Mer-cury, the nearest, followed by Venus, Earth, Mars, the Asteroids, Jupiter, Saturn,Uranus, Neptune (and Pluto). But astrology and traditional symbolism owe theirinspiration not to the Copernican system but to that which had been accepted bythe Ancients. Since the validity of the symbolism here depends exclusively upona process of catasterism (that is, the projection of a given mental order into thecelestial order, or the interpretation of a ‘series’ capable of explaining phenomenain the psychological and spiritual world) it is unnecessary for us to examine thecomplex question of how far the Ptolemaic system (in part confirmed by theTheory of Relativity) can be reconciled with the Copernican. At the same time,the fact of there being seven planets responds to the idea of the seven planetaryheavens, which in turn tallies with that of the seven Directions or areas in space(which in turn, when transposed into terms of time, becomes the origin of theseven days of the week). The relationship of the planets to the seven points inspace is as follows: Sun—the zenith, Moon—the nadir, Mercury—the centre,Venus—the West, Mars—the South, Jupiter—the East, and Saturn—the North(54). The order in which astrology places the planets—counting the Sun and theMoon also as planets—is as follows, taking the Earth as the centre and thenproceeding from the nearest to the farthest: Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun,Mars, Jupiter, Saturn (Uranus and Neptune, although these two are not generallycounted). The sex of these entities is clearly established so far as Venus, Mars,Jupiter and Saturn are concerned. Mercury appears as both masculine and an-drogynous. The Sun and the Moon have interchanged their sex through the ages,according to the culture of the period. The mystic basis of the planetary myth isto be sought in the generalization of Varro to the effect that the planets arecelestial bodies and, at the same time, generators of life (7). Each of these gener-"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"PLANETS258ating powers has a characteristic sphere of action, which is its ‘heaven’, and theinfluence of this ‘heaven’ spreads out through the interpenetrating zones of space.Planetary symbolism reaches its highest degree of complexity in its relationshipto the Zodiac; whereas the Zodiac symbolizes the grades and phases of a givencycle of creation, the planetary ‘series’ expresses rather the pattern of the moralworld. The theory of ‘correspondences’, applied to the planets, educes a com-plex system wherein each planet is seen as a particular ‘mode’ endowed with aspecific characteristic, and related to one particular Sense, or a metal, a perfume,or a plant, for example. It is more important, however, to grasp the connexion ofeach planet with a given virtue or tendency: thus, the Sun is related to the will andto activity, the Moon to imagination and the world of forms, Mars to action anddestruction, Mercury to intuition and movement, Jupiter to good judgement anddirection, Venus to love and relationships, Saturn to endurance and reserve. How-ever, the fundamental tendencies of these qualities are sometimes negative andsometimes positive. Ely Star suggests the following arrangement, in accordancewith the principles of evolution and spiritualization: Sun—potential good, Moon—potential evil, Mercury—duality and, consequently, free will, Venus—objectivegood, Mars—objective evil, Jupiter—subjective good, Saturn—subjective evil.The planets are thus divided into two zones, one luminous and the other dark,both of them necessary to the cycle of existence; these zones correspond to theclear and dark sections respectively of the Chinese symbol of universal flux—theYang-Yin (54). Mertens-Stienon has studied the planetary powers in their theogonicaspect, proceeding from the outside inward, so that the most distant becomes theoldest and the most ‘primitive’ of the gods: Uranus engenders Saturn (celestialspace creates time), and the reign of Saturn is succeeded by the constructive orderof Jupiter; next comes the offspring of Jupiter—Mars (the active principle),Venus (the passive) and Mercury (the neutral) (40). From the symbolic point ofview, this evolutive series draws the inquirer inwards, concentrating itself withinthe human spirit, since the spirit is the microcosm which reflects the macrocosmicuniverse. The importance of the planetary archetypes is apparent in the persis-tent influence of Graeco-Roman mythology, for it was the classic myths thatmost clearly and forcibly expressed their inner meaning; as Jean Seznec (53) hasshown, these myths continued in popularity throughout the Christian culture ofthe Middle Ages and the Renaissance unopposed by the Church, since it per-ceived their symbolic and psychological truth. Waldemar Fenn maintains thatthere are certain prehistoric engravings which contain groups of four and of threecomponent elements and that these drawings correspond to planetary configura-tions. The popular art of the Nordic races, of course, keeps to this division of the"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"PLAYING-CARDS259spheres—essential from the psychological viewpoint—into two groups: an innergroup of three factors and an outer one of four. Given the equation of the planetswith the seven Directions of Space (as we have previously outlined), then theinner group (disposed along the vertical axis) would comprise the series of Sun-Mercury-Moon, while the outer, equivalent to the cardinal points, relates toVenus-Mars-Jupiter-Saturn. This suggests that, as components of the humanspirit, the three central ingredients have more importance and greater influencethan the outer four, since the latter concern the square and the symbolism ofsituation and limitation (as with the tetramorphs), whereas the former constitutethe very psychic dynamism of the ternary order, comprehending the active, thepassive and the neuter.Plants An image of life, expressive of the manifestation of the cosmos and ofthe birth of forms. Aquatic plants, in particular, are symbolic of the ‘nascent’character of life. In India, cosmic images are depicted as emerging from the lotusflower (17). At the same time, man, conscious that biologically he was related tothe animals, could not but be aware that his upright posture was more closelyrelated to that of the tree, the shrub and the very grass, than to the horizontalposture of all animals (other than the celestial birds). Thus, whereas totemismdrew up relationships between man and certain animals, the astrobiological erawas characterized by frequent connexions and equations between mythic beingsand plants. In particular, lives which had come to a violent end were supposed tocarry on a metamorphosed existence in vegetable form. Osiris, Attis, Adonis, toname only a few deities, are closely related to plants. Another aspect of plant-symbolism is the annual cycle, in consequence of which they sometimes symbol-ize the mystery of death and resurrection (17). The fertility of the fields affordsthe most powerful image of cosmic, material and spiritual fecundity.Playing-cards The entire pack of playing-cards is symbolic in origin. It findsits fullest expression in the twenty-two major enigmas of the Tarot pack (eachcard representing an integral allegory which is, up to a certain point, complete initself), followed by the fifty-six lesser enigmas. The latter comprise fourteenfigures in each of the four suits: gold—equivalent to diamonds (made up ofcircles, disks and wheels), clubs (truncheons and sceptres), spades (swords) andcups—equivalent to hearts. The gold symbolizes the material forces; the club orstaff the power of command; the cup or chalice varies somewhat in significancebut generally concerns the receptacle as such: the chalice or the chest, for in-stance; the sword is an emblem, in this particular instance, of discriminationbetween error and justice. The number inscribed on each card implies the symbol-ism pertaining to that particular number, see TAROT."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"PLEIADES260Pleiades The constellation of the Pleiades comprises the central group insidereal symbolism. Both Hebrew and Hindu traditions see in these stars theimage of the septenary as applied to space, to sound and to action (40).Plough Symbol of fertilization. In an Aryan legend, Rama, the hero, marriesSita (the furrow). Because the earth is female in nature, ploughing is a symbol ofthe union of the male and the female principle. The former Chinese custom ofceremonial ploughing by the emperor at the beginning of his reign is connectedwith this symbolism (33).Point The point signifies unity, the Origin and the Centre. It also representsthe principles of manifestation and emanation, and hence in some mandalas thecentre is not actually shown but must be imagined by the initiate. There are twokinds of point to be considered: that which has no magnitude and is symbolic ofcreative virtue, and that which—as suggested by Raymond Lull in his NovaGeometria—has the smallest conceivable or practicable magnitude and is a sym-bol of the principle of manifestation. Moses of Leon defined the nature of theoriginal Point as follows: ‘This degree is the sum total of all subsequent mirrors,that is, of all external aspects related to this one degree. They proceed therefrombecause of the mystery of the point, which is in itself an occult degree emanatingfrom the mystery of the pure and awe-inspiring ether. The first degree of all isabsolutely occult, that is, not manifest, and cannot be attained’ (25). This ex-plains why the Centre—identical with the mystic point of Moses of Leon—isusually represented as a hole.Pole The mystic ‘Centre’, or the ‘unvarying mean’, is the fixed point whichall symbolic traditions concur in designating as the ‘pole’, since the rotation of theearth takes place around it (28). On the other hand, the pole is also identified withthe zenith. In ancient China, it was represented by the hole in the centre of thejade disk known as Pi (7). The ‘unvarying mean’ is, nevertheless, the cause of allchange. The Chinese Book of Changes shows that the continuous metamorpho-ses of matter are generated by the great pole—a Oneness located far beyond allduality, beyond all occurence, and equated with the ‘unmoved mover’ of Aristotle(58). This contradiction between the immobile and the cause of all movement wasexpressed metaphorically by the alchemists in the saying: ‘At the pole lies theheart of Mercury, which is true fire’ (32).Pomegranate The Greeks believed that the pomegranate sprang from theblood of Dionysos. There are similar beliefs linking anemones with Adonis andviolets with Attis (21). But the predominating significance of the pomegranate,arising from its shape and internal structure rather than from its colour, is thereconciliation of the multiple and diverse within apparent unity. Hence, in the"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"POWER261Bible, for example, it appears as a symbol of the Oneness of the universe (37). Itis also symbolic of fecundity.Poplar In addition to the general symbolism attached to trees, wood andvegetable life, the poplar has a special allegorical significance connected with thefact that the two sides of the poplar leaf are of a different shade of green. Thus, itbecomes the tree of life, bright green on the side of water (moon) and a darkergreen on the side of fire (sun) (50). The poplar also has a place within the generalrange of bipolar symbols (positive-negative) (32).Potion Generally a love-potion, frequently mentioned in Roman antiquity,where it is said, for example, that the poet Lucretius’ madness was caused by apotion. It appears with still greater frequency in mediaeval legends and is relatedto the Celtic geis, according to Jean Marx (Nouvelles Recherches sur la littératureArthurienne). A potion symbolizes love’s ill-fortune. Whoever drinks it can nolonger observe the feudal laws, nor the duties incumbent on his position, and caneven be driven to death by this plight, as exemplified by Tristan.Potne Theron This is the name given by the Greeks to compositionsdepicting the figure of a man between two animals; they were much used inancient and mediaeval art (for example, the harp of Ur in Mesopotamia; thecapital at Estany; Cappadocian seals, or Sumerian ivories). Sometimes this fea-ture attached itself to legendary or historic figures: Gilgamesh in Mesopotamia,or Daniel and the lions in the Christian, Biblical tradition. But, for the Greeks, thiscomposition was a symbol of the union of man with nature, or of the equilibriumof forces necessary to bring this union about. Now, in the view of Shekotov, theRussian art critic, ‘the symmetrical disposition of figures around a single centredenotes, both in an artistic context and in religious or profane ceremonies, the ideaof triumph’.Power The symbolism of power has been subjected to an extensive study byPercy Ernst Schramm in his Herrschaftszeichen und Staatssymbolik (Stuttgart,1954). Power, as a symbol, represents irradiating force, but it is only latterly thatit has acquired this significance, for in totemistic and primitive times it wasgenerally understood more in the sense of an image of the forces of nature (and ofthe animal world in particular) than as an expression of abstract or temporaldominion. Hence, the principal attributes of a superior power are simply magni-fied versions of totemic emblems or of adornments derived from them, such asnecklaces of teeth and claws, hides, head-dresses, horns, and various kinds ofstandards exhibiting these objects. It was probably with the dawning of the solarcult that the diadem—the original form of the crown—came to be adopted asanother attribute of power. The immediate effect of the assumption of power"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"POWER262upon the body and the attitude of mind is to confer impassivity, indifference—either real or affected—and serenity and, equally, a tendency to ‘swell withpride’. Hence the fascination of the hieratic gesture and its use on solemn occa-sions. Dynamic movements such as stretching out the arms or nodding or turningthe head may also be executed in a rhythm suggestive of hieratic strength andcalm. Ancient art gave expression to a basically similar attitude towards thepowers of the world. Height above ground-level, and the situation of a particularsymbolic element at the centre of a symmetrical pattern—the Greek Potne Theronfor instance—are further illustrations of power-symbolism, deriving from thesymbolisms of level and of the ‘Centre’. Differentiated expressions of power giverise to the king, the priest and the military leader, each one characterized by hisrespective attributes. The synthesis of power is denoted by ternary symbolssuch as the triple crown. Certain other symbols embracing the threefold power,such as the trident, are generally reckoned to pertain to the infernal regions, butthis has come about rather through the influence of traditional, mythological ideasthan by true symbolic logic. Magic power—a corrupt form of religious power—is symbolized by the wand and sometimes by the sword. There are also certainother objects linked with the idea of power, but they are attributes or instrumentsrather than symbols proper.Of great interest is the complex symbolic system behind the emblems of theEgyptian pharaoh. The double crown denotes Upper and Lower Egypt, but italso expresses the ideas of the masculine and feminine principles, and of heavenand earth. Sceptres—straight (the lash) and curved (the crook)—are probablyattributes of cattle-raising and of agriculture respectively; yet at the same timethey denote the straight path (or the solar, diurnal, logical course) and the crookedpath (the lunar, nocturnal and intuitive). The Uraeus beyond doubt symbolizesthe sublimated serpent—raised, that is to say, in height (the kundalini), so as tobecome a symbol of strength transformed into spirit or an aspect of power. Initself, the idea of power embraces the notions of extreme self-awareness andintegrity, defensive concentration of forces, appropriation and domination of theenvironment, and effulgence. Hence, to take these ideas in turn, the symbols ofpower are names, seals, marks, standards and signs; masks, helmets, head-dresses,swords and shields; sceptres, crowns, pallia and palaces; and effulgence is ex-pressed by gold and precious stones. Domination also finds expression in suchforms of the quaternary as four-headed sceptres, hermae or thrones alluding tothe cardinal points. The crown, in its most highly developed form, embraces thediadem or circle and the hemisphere or image of the vault of heavens; and some-times it denotes the four points of the compass—or suggests them by means of"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"PRINCE263four bands which rise up from the diadem to meet higher up, in the middle,surmounted by another symbolic motif. The idea of royalty is, of course, linkedwith sun-symbolism, and therefore the animals associated with it are such as theeagle and the lion, and on occasion the dragon. Once Christianity had become theofficial religion of the Roman Empire, various Christian symbols of sublimationaccrue to the symbolism of power, notably the crucifix and the fleur-de-lis. Thelatter symbol is found in Byzantium, whence it reached Central Europe, Ger-many, France and the Western world by the 1st millennium A.D.Precinct All images to do with the precinct—an enclosure, a walled garden,a city, a square, a castle, a patio—correspond to the idea of the temenos, or asacred and circumscribed space which is guarded and defended because it consti-tutes a spiritual entity. Such images as this may also symbolize the life of theindividual and in particular the inner life of his thoughts (32). It will be recognizedthat a square or a circle is the tactical formation commonly adopted as a means ofdefence in a critical situation against a more powerful adversary. This in itselfwould suffice to explain the meaning of the mandala, or any one of the innumer-able symbols that are based upon the notion of the precinct or the protection ofa given space, identified with the self. Circular dances, such as the maypole dance,or the sardana of Catalonia; or the prehistoric stone-circles (sometimes known ascromlechs); or emblems featuring fences or people formed in a circle—all carrythis same symbolic meaning, this same notion of self-protection, as Adama vanScheltema has noted in Documents VII (Paris, 1930) in connexion with the Centreféminin sacré.Prester John The realm of the fabulous Prester John, like certain othermythic ‘lands’, is, in fact, a symbol of the supreme, spiritual ‘centre’ (28).Prime Matter This represents the basic stage out of which grew the alchemicprocess with its quest for the transmutation of gold, that is, for perfect anddefinitive sublimation, or the consolidation of the spirit itself. The alchemistsgave a host of names to this unidentified prime matter: quicksilver, lead, salt,sulphur, water, air, fire, earth, blood, lapis, poison, spirit, sky, dew, shade, mother,sea, moon, dragon, chaos, microcosm, etc. The Rosarium terms it ‘root of itself’,and elsewhere it is named ‘earth of paradise’. This explains why prime matterwas thought to come from the mountain where distinctions are still unknown andwhere all things are one, neither distinguished nor distinguishable (32).

Davy points out that it takes its meaningfrom the idea of a pilgrimage and indicates the need for constant progress unfet-tered by earthly things, although making progressive use of them. The idea of theprocession is also reminiscent of the Exodus of Israel and of the desert-crossing(14). As Schneider has noted, the movements of claustral processions imply asymbolism related to space-time: the hymns which are sung last the length of theprocession; the return to the cloister is equivalent to the passage of a year byvirtue of the correspondence of the four sides with the cardinal points and theseasons. But, speaking more generally, every procession is a rite which givessubstance to the concept of the cycle and passage of time, as is proved by the factof its returning to the point of departure. Various symbolic and allegorical figuresare attached to it: the Chinese dragons, for instance, or the Roman eagles (since amilitary march-past is a form of procession). Christianity has incorporated someearly aspects of the symbol into its rites; for example, there is a book upon St.Macarius that contains some allegorical chariots with all the principal symbolicanimals drawing them, from the bear and the rhinoceros to the unicorn and thephoenix. Those festivals which have incorporated elements of folklore have like-wise assimilated the symbolic implications of folk art. From prehistoric times,giants, carnival grotesques, dwarfs, dragons, vipers, lions, oxen, have all figured inprocessions. The famous tarasque(1) of Tarascon, has been seen as the GreatWhore of Babylon. The eagle may correspond to St. John; the viper and thedragon allude to the legend of St. George. According to esoteric thought, giants,dwarfs, salamanders and nymphs are elemental spirits pertaining respectively toair, earth, fire and water. To carry them in procession is to display man’s domin-ion over them, for although they are borne in triumph, they are really exhibited ascaptives; and it was in this sense that the Romans incorporated them into theirgrand march-past at the end of a campaign.Professions Schneider has noted the sober and artisan character of mysticthought, with its belief that an individual’s profession or calling is what basicallydetermines his mythic and cosmic situation. This is not to invalidate common-sense ways of thinking, but to substantiate them by rooting them firmly in theplane of transcendence. Were we to envisage an ideal landscape with a valley, amountain with its corresponding cave, and the sea, we would find that the sea isthe haunt of seamen and fishermen, the valley corresponds to labourers and1 The figure of a huge serpent or dragon carried in Corpus Christi processions.—Translator"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"PROFESSIONS265gardeners, the mountain-side to shepherds, the cave to blacksmiths and perhapsalso to potters, and the mountain-peak to the ascetic and the lofty-minded sages.Schneider suggests that, by analogy, the mountain is also the dwelling-place ofwarriors, miners, doctors and martyrs (50, 51). In order to determine the appro-priate grade of each profession it is necessary only to apply the laws of thesymbolism of level. If the symbolic significance of any profession lies in thetranslation of its practical aspects to the realm of the spiritual or the psychologi-cal, the sailor’s calling symbolizes the coming to grips with the unconscious andwith the passions, or the struggle at the level of the chaotic. The fisherman drawssymbolic tokens out of the deeps. The farmer is in close contact with fecundnature and contributes with his labours to the fertility of the soil. The gardenerfulfils the same function on a higher spiritual and intellectual plane, for the gardenis a symbol of the soul, and he works upon his garden in order to improve it.Blacksmiths and potters are creators of forms, masters of matter. The miners’work is analogous to that of fishermen, since they extract what is valuable fromone of the Elements. The ascetic and the sage direct the pattern of life, virtuallywithout action. Doctors purify existence and combat what is harmful. The mar-tyr suffers and triumphs over life by his sacrifice. Other callings related to thedemiurge are those of the weaver and the spinner (who spin and sever the threadsof existence). There were certain professions which, about the 4th millenniumbefore our era, characterized the period of the profoundest development in man.As Berthelot has observed, the devising of the calendar, the development ofmetallurgy and the production of the first of the alloys (bronze), seem to havebeen the causes of the change from primitive to civilized cultures (in Mesopotamiaand Egypt in the first place). Berthelot has also drawn an interesting parallelbetween the development of certain cults and the corresponding growth of theprofessions which determined and demanded them as the level of civilizationrose. The hunters, fishermen and weavers of the Palaeolithic Age limited theircults to the animals which provided them with their subsistence; the shepherdand seafarer of Neolithic and early historical times based their cults upon themoon and the stars, which were their means of orientation; the blacksmith, met-allurgist and early chemist, with whom the era of recorded history opens, exaltedfire in their cults, since it played a decisive part in their work. And finally, theagricultural worker, or the prevalence of his conception of the world, ensured thepredominance of the solar cult, since the sun is the creator of the cycle of the yearand of the seasons. In the above observations, then, we have attempted to showhow men’s callings are graduated from the most primitive to the most recent, withtheir corresponding symbolism (7). The caste-system may also be related to this."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"PROMETHEUS266Prometheus The Prometheus myth, according to Piobb, is an illustration ofsublimation—by virtue of the family resemblance between the vulture and theeagle—which confirms the alchemic relationship between the volatile and thefixed principles. At the same time, suffering (like that of Prometheus) corre-sponds to sublimation because of its association with the colour red—the thirdcolour in the alchemic Magnum Opus, coming after black and white. The rescue ofPrometheus by Hercules expresses the efficacy of the process of sublimation,and its outcome (48).Promised Land, The The Promised Land—the Holy Land—was, for thealchemists, with their concept of the three worlds as ‘states’ and of landscapes as‘expressions’, the ‘final stage of an experiment’. Where, within the order of time,peace and perfection is the goal, within the order of space it becomes the Prom-ised Land, whether it is Canaan for the Jews wandering in the desert, or Ithaca forUlysses sailing the seas (57). The Israelites identified their spiritual ‘Centre’ withMount Sion, known to them as the ‘heart of the world’. Dante described Jerusa-lem as the ‘pole of the spirit’ (28).Pumpkin or Gourd, Double A Chinese emblem of Li T’ieh-kuai, the secondof the Eight Immortals. Like the hour-glass, twin drums, St. Andrew’s cross or theletter X, it is a symbol of the link between the two worlds—the upper and thelower—and of the principle of inversion regulating the ordered pattern of eventsof cosmic phenomena, that is, night and day, life and death, infamy and sublimity,sorrow and joy. Li T’ieh-kuai was, in effect, a mythic figure whose essentialcharacteristic was his ability to leave his body and visit heaven. He was alsosymbolized by a column of smoke (5). But this symbol of the twin pumpkin isvery far from being limited to the Far East; it was also common in the West.Among other representations, the frontispiece of Book II of Maier’s work onalchemy, Symbola Aureae Mensae (1617) shows us the twin pumpkin in the formof two amphorae, with the top one up-ended. The surprising thing is that thisimage also incorporates the above-mentioned symbol of the column of smokejoining the interior of the lower amphora with the upper; in this case there is notjust a single column, but a ring of smoke circulating between the mouths of thetwo amphorae.Pun Schneider (50) has summed up one of the most profound of all symbolicquestions with his remark that ‘to create a poetic pun is to jump over or annihilatethe distance between two logical or spatial elements—to place under one yoketwo elements which are naturally discrete’. This is the explanation too of themystic sense of modern poetry derived from Rimbaud and Reverdy. In the wordsof the latter: ‘The image is a pure creation of the spirit. It is born not of a"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"PYRAMID267comparison, but of the reconciliation of two more or less distinct realities. Themore distant and apt the two realities so reconciled, the stronger will be the image,and the greater emotive force and poetic reality will it possess’—symbolic real-ity, we would rather say. In consequence, what is equivocal tends towards theorgiastic disruption of the ‘given order’ to make way for the ‘new order’. Hencethe fact that ‘the art of equivocal phrases’ always expresses, in a cultural sense,the need to invert one style in order to attain the opposite (as, for instance, fromthe Gothic to the Renaissance, or from 19th-century realism to the formalist styleof the 20th century).Putrefaction The alchemic symbolism of putrefactio, with its graphic repre-sentation as black crows, skeletons, skulls and other funereal signs, embraces theconcept of life renewed—like the zodiacal sign of Pisces. Hence it has been saidthat it signifies ‘rebirth of matter after death and the disintegration of the residue’(57). From the psychological point of view, putrefaction is the destruction of theintellectual impediments in the way of the evolution of the spirit. Certain ritesand folkloristic customs seem to be derived from the alchemic concept; at least,they appear in a similar symbolism. Thus in Corella (Navarre), the Good Fridayprocession is headed by a skeleton which, in ancient times, had bunches of grapeshanging from its back. This conveys the idea of the new life, which arises fromputrefactio, and which was in reality already present in the Orphic mysteries andin all beliefs in the value of sacrifice as the generator of new forces.Pyramid There is an apparent contradiction in the symbolism of the pyra-mid. In the first place, in megalithic culture and in European folklores which havepreserved its memory, it is symbolic of the earth in its maternal aspect. Pyramidswith Christmas decorations and lights, moreover, express the twofold idea ofdeath and immortality, both associated with the Great Mother. But this concernsthe pyramid only in so far as it is a hollow mountain, the dwelling of ancestorsand an earth-monument. The pyramid of stone, of regular geometrical shape,corresponds to fire, at any rate in the Far East (4). Marc Saunier has suggested theright approach to a more precise understanding of the problem. He regards thepyramid as a synthesis of different forms, each with its own significance. Thebase is square and represents the earth. The apex is the starting-point and thefinishing-point of all things—the mystic ‘Centre’ (Nicholas of Cusa, in his dis-quisitions, concurs with this interpretation). Joining the apex to the base are thetriangular-shaped faces of the pyramid, symbolizing fire, divine revelation andthe threefold principle of creation. In consequence, the pyramid is seen as asymbol expressing the whole of the work of creation in its three essential aspects(49)."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"QUADRIGA      268QQuadriga A variant of the square (q.v.). It carries the inherent symbolism ofthe quaternary, here implied in the four horses drawing the chariot. With this inmind, Dio Chrysostom worked out the following analogies: the charioteer corre-sponds to the Pantokrator and the chariot to the halo (indicating two differentlevels of the manifest world through the intersection of the circles of heaven andearth); and the four horses relate to the four Elements and the tetramorphs. Thesymbolic relationship of the horses with the Elements is the key to the followingpassage: ‘The first horse is very fleet. His coat is shining and bears the signs of theplanets and the constellations. The second horse is slower and is lit up on onlyone side. The third goes slower still and the fourth twists round and round. Butthere comes a time when the hot breath of the first sets fire to the mane of thesecond, and the third drowns the fourth with his sweat.’ The four horses corre-spond to fire, air, water and earth respectively, beginning with the most energeticof the Elements and ending with the most material or lento. The quadriga, then,becomes a symbol of the universe of space-time (31).Quaternary The quaternary bears the same relationship to the number-series as does the tetramorph on the mystic plane; if they are not identical theyare certainly related or analogous. It is based, of course, upon the number four. Inthe words of Plato: ‘The ternary is the number pertaining to the idea; the quater-nary is the number connected with the realization of the idea.’ Hence within theseptuple pattern of space, the ternary is situated on the vertical line because it isassociated with the vertical division into three worlds on three levels, whereas thequaternary is located on the surface, that is, on the intermediate of the threeplanes, or, in other words, it is situated in the world of phenomena. The quater-nary, then, corresponds to earth, to the material pattern of life; and the numberthree to moral and spiritual dynamism. The human anatomy confirms this con-cept of the number four. The spatial or surface-symbolism of the number four isdescribed by the Renaissance writer, Cartari, in Les Images des dieux des anciens:‘The square figures representing Mercury, possessing only a head and a phallus,signified that the sun is the lord of the world, the sower of all things; furthermore,the four sides of the square represented what the four-stringed sistrum portrayedas an attribute of Mercury, that is, the four regions of the world, or, in otherwords, the four seasons. . . .’ (32). There is a clear connexion between these"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"QUATERNARY269‘herms’ and the Indian figures of Brahma with four faces (60), corresponding tothe four Kumaras (who were four angels in Persian tradition), related to the fourso-called ‘royal’ stars (Aldebaran, Antares, Regulus and Fomalhaut) and repre-sented by the four fixed signs of the Zodiac, in turn related to the tetramorphs.Another obvious connexion is the symbol of the four rivers of paradise which riseat the foot of the Tree of Life (or the world-axis) (40). This fourfold orientationconforms with the cardinal points which, according to the Zohar, correspond tothe four Elements (9) and to all quaternary forms. The most interesting of thesecorrespondences are these: East corresponding to spring, air, infancy, dawn andthe crescent moon; South, to summer, fire, youth, midday and full moon; West, toautumn, water, middle-age, evening and the waning moon; North, to winter, earth,old age, night and the new moon. As is the case with symbols based upon seven(the week or the planets, for example) or upon twelve (the year or the Zodiac),analogies with the symbolism for four may extend to cover every possible pro-cess in life (55). The Elements correspond to the so-called elemental beings asfollows: Air—sylphs and giants; fire—salamanders; water—undines and mer-maids; earth—gnomes and dwarfs. Gaston Bachelard considers that the fourtemperaments are related to the Elements (1), in which case the pattern of corre-spondences might be seen as follows: Air linked with the sanguinary; fire with thenervous; water with the lymphatic; earth with the bilious (55). Bachelard, in hispsychoanalytic work upon the significance of the Elements, studies the signifi-cant way in which dynamic images are related with a particular Element, such asthe image of fire in Hoffmann, water in Edgar Allan Poe, air in Nietzsche. Toreturn to the question, of the cardinal points, there is not complete accord aboutwhich of them—West or North—is the most negative, but there is completeagreement that the East is the luminous source of the spirit (14, 31, 48). In China,the Emperor once used to perform a strange rite whereby he identified himselfwith the annual course of the sun, embracing also the points of the compass. Thishe did by living in one quarter of his square-shaped palace at a time, dependingupon the season and the compass-point corresponding to that season (in accor-dance with the pattern we have just mentioned) (7). The mystic animals corre-sponding to the cardinal points are: East, blue dragon; South, red bird; West,white tiger; North, black tortoise (6). But in the Western world, according toSchneider, these animals become: East (or the morning)—lion; South (or mid-day)—eagle; West (or the evening)—peacock; North (or the night)—ox (50). Theimportance of the number four is borne out statistically: the square is the shapemost frequently used by man, or, where necessary, the rectangle. According to a"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"QUINARY270Hindu belief—comparable with the Platonic—completeness has four angles andis supported on four feet (60). Jung has shown profound interest in the symbol-ism of the quaternary, and upon its basis he has built up the pattern of the humanpsyche as one endowed with four functions: sensing, intuiting, feeling and think-ing. These four functions he relates to the four ends of a cross, postulating thatthe three placed respectively at the left, the right and the top are conscious, whilethe fourth is unconscious (or repressed). But the placing of the functions variesaccording to the individual personality (34). These four functions cluster aroundthe essential component of volition or judgement, just as the tetramorphs areranged around the Pantokrator. Jung adds that the principal components—thearchetypes—of the human being are disposed similarly in quaternary order; theyare: the anima, shadow, ego and personality forming around the Selbst or ‘the Godwithin’ (32). The phases of the alchemic process may also be placed in quater-nary order, from lowest to highest: black, white, red, gold. Diel’s ‘life-urges’ maybe similarly ordered, for although Diel mentions only three (conservation, repro-duction and spiritualization or evolution) this is because the hidden function, inthis case, is thanatism.Quinary This is a group of five elements. It is represented formally by thepentagon and the five-pointed star, and also by the square together with itscentral point. Traditionally, the number five symbolizes man after the fall, but,once applied to this order of earthly things, it signifies health and love (44).Esoteric thinking sees this, not as the effect but, in fact, as the cause of man’s fiveextremities with the number five inscribed also on each hand and foot (54). Thisassociation of the number five with the human figure, common during the Ro-manesque period, is found all over the world, from England to the Far East.Agrippa of Nettesheim depicted the image of man with arms and legs apart andrelated to the pentagram. Many amulets and talismans are based upon the numberfive, not only because of the associated ideas of the human figure, health (orphysical integrity) and love, but because the quinary is symbolic of the whole ofthe material world (denoted by the quaternary) plus the centre or quintessence. InMorocco, for example, to protect oneself against the evil eye one repeats thephrase hamsa fi ainek (‘five in your eye’). Certain Islamic rites and conceptswere patterned after the quinary: there are five religious duties, five keys to secretknowledge, five daily prayers and a solemn oath is repeated five times (12). Forthe Chinese, five is the most important of all the numbers. The quinary, in sum,represents the natural rhythm of life, the order of the cosmos. The followinggroups (among others) are based upon the quinary ‘model’: the five planets"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"RATS271(Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn); the five elemental forms (metal, veg-etable, water, fire, earth); the five colours (white, black, blue, red, yellow); thefive musical timbres (of bronze, stone, silk, wood and clay); the five essentiallandscapes (of mountains and woods, rivers and lakes, hills, fertile plains, springsand swamps) (13). In the Near East and in the West the number five has been usedsolely as an expression of the human figure as a whole, and of eroticism; here thepredominant model-numbers have been four and seven, and it is according tothese numbers that the cosmic components of the universe and of man have beenordered.RRadiance Bachelard (3) has suggested that there is an interesting connexionbetween radiance, the human glance and starlight. In itself, a brightness or radi-ance is always felt to be supernatural, like a message standing out clearly againsta negative or neutral background. Brightness is, of course, related to fire and todaylight both in their positive and in their destructive aspects.Rags and Tatters They are symbolic of wounds and gashes in the soul. Moreprecise meanings are derived from the actual garment which is in tatters.Rahab This priestess symbolizes primordial chaos mastered by God in thebeginning of time, comparable with Tiamat vanquished by Marduk in Chaldeantradition (7). She represents the essential idea of all cosmogonies.Rain Rain has a primary and obvious symbolism as a fertilizing agent, and isrelated to the general symbolism of life (26) and water. Apart from this, but forthe same reason, it signifies purification, not only because of the value of water asthe ‘universal substance’—as the mediating agent between the non-formal orgaseous and the formal or solid, an aspect which is common to all symbolictraditions (29)—but also because of the fact that rainwater falls from heaven (7).Hence it is also cognate with light. This explains why, in many mythologies, rainis regarded as a symbol of the ‘spiritual influences’ of heaven descending uponearth (28). In alchemy, rain symbolizes condensation or albification—furtherproof that, for the alchemists, water and light were of the same symbolic family.Rats The rat occurs in association with infirmity and death. It was an evil-doing deity of the plague in Egypt and China (35). The mouse, in mediaevalsymbolism, is associated with the devil (20).

The square impliestense domination born of an abstract longing for power, whereas the circle avoidsall earthly associations by virtue of its celestial symbolism. Less regular shapesthan the rectangle, such as the trapezium or the trapezoid, are abnormal or dolor-ous forms, expressive of suffering and inner irregularity (42).Red Sea In alchemic symbolism ‘crossing the Red Sea’ is symbolic of themost dangerous part of an undertaking or of a stage in a man’s life. To leave Egyptfor the Promised Land implies the act of crossing this sea bloodied with woundsand sacrifice; hence the crossing is a symbol of spiritual evolution (57) and also ofdeath seen as the threshold between the worlds of matter and of the spirit. Theman who sacrifices himself, in a sense dies.Reefs Reefs and shoals were, in antiquity, the object of religious awe andwere personified as giants and aquatic monsters (8). Sandbanks and even islandswere looked upon in the same way. Here we can see the great myth of regressionor petrifaction (that is, stagnation of the spiritual flow of evolution) which theancient mind considered the worst of all crimes. Hence, in the Odyssey, reefs,islands, complete with their enchantress (Calypso or Circe), and quicksands, areall symbols of every kind of enchantment and obstruction of destiny.Regard or Glance To regard some object, or simply to see it, is traditionallyidentified with acquaintance or awareness (and also with the possession of knowl-edge or simply with possession) (26). On the other hand, the glance is symboli-cally comparable with the teeth in representing the defensive barrier put up bythe individual against the world round him—the towers and the city wall, respec-tively, of the ‘city within’.Reins Reins enter into the symbolism of the chariot and of horses. Since thechariot is symbolic of the body and horses signify the forces of life, the reinsbespeak the relationship between the soul and the body—the nerves and will-power. To cut the reins is equivalent, symbolically, to dying (38).Relief The depth of a relief, in general corresponding to the vividness of theforms depicted rather than to their intensity, is connected with the ideas of truthand material reality. A relief which is lacking in force symbolizes futility, falsity,equivocation and utter lack of persuasive power or of attractive ‘values’ of anykind. An intensely expressive relief, on the other hand, denotes the powerfulsurge of an emotion or of an idea in all its nascent power."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"RITE273Return The return home, or the return to the material home or to themotherland or birthplace, is symbolic of death, not in the sense of total destruc-tion but of reintegration of the spirit into the Spirit.

Eliade, 17), the rhomb is emblematic of thefemale sexual organ. This would seem to confirm the Greek definition of therhomb as an instrument of magic which, when brandished, was supposed toexcite and inflame the passions of men (8)—an analogous and related idea, fetish-ist in character.Ribbons Ribbons knotted together to form a circle (worn by Romans as akind of diadem in the same way as they wore garlands of flowers) are symbols ofimmortality by virtue of their circular shape. They also carry a heroic signifi-cance, like all crowns or garlands, for the very act of ‘crowning’ an undertakingfulfilled is so called because of the symbolic relationship between the crown andthe concept of absolute fulfilment.Ring Like every closed circle, the ring is a symbol of continuity and whole-ness. This is why (like the bracelet) it has been used both as a symbol of marriageand of the eternally repeated time-cycle. Sometimes it occurs in animal form, as asnake or an eel biting its tail (Ouroboros); sometimes as a pure geometrical form(8, 20, 32). It is interesting to note that, in some legends, the ring is regarded as theonly remaining link of a chain. Thus, it is told that when Jupiter allowed Herculesto rescue Prometheus, it was on condition that the latter should thereafter wear aniron ring, set with a piece of rock from the Caucasus, as a symbol of submissionto his punishment (8). Another type of ring is found in the circle of flamessurrounding the dancing Shiva as he performs the cosmic dance; this flame-ringcan be related to the Zodiac. Like the Zodiac and the Ouroboros of the Gnostics,it has an active and a passive half (evolution, involution), and stands for the life-cycle of both the universe and each individual being: the circular dance of naturein eternal process of creation and destruction. At the same time, the light radiatedby the ring of flames symbolizes eternal wisdom and transcendental illumination(60).Rite In essence, every rite symbolizes and reproduces creation (17). Hence,rites are connected with the symbolism of ornaments (38). The slow-movingritual, characteristic of all ceremonies, is closely bound up with the rhythm of theastral movements (3). At the same time, every rite is a meeting, that is, a confluence"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"RIVER    274of forces and patterns; the significance of rites stems from the accumulated powerof these forces when blended harmoniously one with the other.River An ambivalent symbol since it corresponds to the creative power bothof nature and of time. On the one hand it signifies fertility and the progressiveirrigation of the soil; and on the other hand it stands for the irreversible passage oftime and, in consequence, for a sense of loss and oblivion (8, 60).Rock The Chinese attribute to the rock a symbolism denoting permanence,solidity and integrity (5), and this may be taken as generally valid. Like the stone,it is held in many traditions to be the dwelling-place of a god. As a Caucasiantradition has it: ‘In the beginning, the world was covered with water. The greatcreator-god then dwelt inside a rock’ (35). It seems, then, that man intuitivelyregards stones (as in the myth of Deucalion) and rocks as the source of human life,while the soil (inferior because more disintegrated) is the mother of vegetable andanimal life. A mystic significance is attributed to this mineral, arising from thesound it makes when struck and because of its unity—that is, its solidity andcohesion.Room A symbol of individuality—of private thoughts. The windows sym-bolize the possibility of understanding and of passing through to the external andthe beyond, and are also an illustration of any idea of communication. Hence, aclosed room lacking windows may be symbolic of virginity, according to Frazer,and also of other kinds of non-communication. Many rites involving theenclosureimage are performed to mark the reaching of puberty, all over the world.The legend about Danae, shut up by her father in a bronze tower, pertains to thisparticular symbolism. There is a Siberian legend concerning a ‘dark house of iron’which is also relevant to it (21). We might also mention the ‘vase with a lid’, oneof the eight emblems of good luck in Chinese Buddhism, and a symbol of whole-ness, of the idea with no ‘exit’, or, in other words, of supreme intelligence trium-phant over birth and death (signified respectively by the doors and windows ofthe room) (5). This explains why the hermetically sealed room may possibly bea variant form of the ‘vase with a lid’.Rope Like the chain, it is a general symbol for binding and connexion.Knotted cord, in Egyptian hieroglyphics, signifies a man’s name. Since the knot isa symbol for the individual’s existence, there are various hieroglyphic signs re-lated to the name of a person in the shape of a knot or a bow or a belt or a crownand so on. The seal has the same significance (19).

Hence, accruing to it are all those ideas associatedwith these qualities: the mystic Centre, the heart (14), the garden of Eros, theparadise of Dante (4), the beloved (31), the emblem of Venus (8) and so on. Moreprecise symbolic meanings are derived from the colour and number of its petals.The relationship of the white rose to the red is in accordance with the relationshipbetween the two colours as defined in alchemy (q.v.). The blue rose is symbolicof the impossible. The golden rose is a symbol of absolute achievement. When therose is round in shape, it corresponds in significance to the mandala. The seven-petalled rose alludes to the septenary pattern (that is, the seven Directions ofSpace, the seven days of the week, the seven planets, the seven degrees ofperfection). It is in this sense that it appears in emblem DCCXXIII of the ArsSymbolica of Bosch and in the Summum Bonum of Robert Fludd (32). The eight-petalled rose symbolizes regeneration (46).Rotation For Roux, in Les Druides (Paris, 1961), rotation (the dynamicdetermining of circumference in rites or in art) generates a magic force, particu-larly of a defensive order, since it marks out a sacred precinct—the circle—whichcalls for the projection of the self. For Blavatsky, David’s dance round the Ark,like that of the Sabean star-worshippers, was a circular dance or at least a dancethat followed a closed curve.Round Table The Round Table is equated, by its shape, with the Chinesedisk of jade, Pi, which represents the sky. The appearance of the Grail in thecentre of the table completes the symbolism, for the concave shape of the sacredchalice corresponds to the central hole in the Chinese Pi. The twelve knights arerelated to—but not identical with—the signs of the Zodiac, expressing in particu-lar a parallel tendency, the struggle for the triumph and the establishment of‘paradise regained’, or, in other words, of the ‘unvarying mean’. The tasks allot-ted to the knights implied the perfection of the circle of the sun, and involvedsuccouring the weaker sex, the chastisement of tyrants, the liberation of thebewitched, the outwitting of giants, and the destruction of all evil men and nox-ious animals (4); and this programme was but the prelude to the establishment ofthe reign of the ‘Centre’. Similar institutions are the ‘round council’ of the DalaiLama (consisting of the twelve great Namshans) and the Twelve Peers of France.The model which is composed of twelve parts is the most important of all (thenext being the ternary division, and then the quaternary and septenary) since it is"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"RUDDER276equated with the circle and, in consequence, with the idea of totality (which is attimes also expressed by the number ten). It was for this reason that the Etruscanstate was divided into twelve parts and Romulus created twelve lictors (28). Theevil that afflicted the Round Table, through the love of Queen Guinevere forLancelot and the frailties of other knights, was sufficient cause for the failure ofthe community of knights to achieve their mystic ends; only Sir Galahad of thepure heart could come near to fulfilment once he had been granted the divine giftsof the shield and the sword.Rudder In ancient representations of ships, the rudder frequently plays animportant part as an allegory expressive of the ideas of safety and the steering ofa straight course. It figures with the same significance in mediaeval and Renais-sance emblems.Ruins The symbolic sense of ruins is self-evident and derived directly fromthe literal sense: they signify desolation and life defunct. They are tantamount tosentiments, ideas or bonds which are no longer animated by the breath of life butwhich nevertheless persist shorn of any use or function relevant to thought andexistence, but saturated with the past and redolent with a sense of the destructionof its reality wrought by the passage of time. Ruins are symbolically equivalentto biological mutilation.SSacrifice The central idea of cosmogonies is that of ‘the primordial sacri-fice’. Inverting the concept, we can deduce that there is no creation withoutsacrifice. To sacrifice what is esteemed is to sacrifice oneself, and the spiritualenergy thereby acquired is proportional to the importance of what is lost. Allforms of suffering can be sacrificial, if fully and wholeheartedly sought and ac-cepted. The physical and negative signs—of mutilation, chastisement, self-abase-ment and severe penalties or tribulations—are all symbolic of the obverse tenden-cies in the spiritual order.

(See illustration p. 103.)Sagittarius According to Subba Rao, this is a cosmic symbol expressive ofthe complete man—he who is at once animal, spiritual and worthy of his divineorigin. Man thus constitutes a link between heaven and earth, implying a state oftension which finds its symbolic expression in the arc (or rainbow). Sagittarius,the Centaur, or the Archer signify this triple nature of the symbol; the horsesymbolizes the instinctive organism, the human part denotes the three higherprinciples embracing the monad as expressed by the arrow. In the Babylonianepic of Gilgamesh, Sagittarius is represented by ‘scorpion-men’ who are ‘no morethan two-thirds divine’ (40).Sails In Egyptian hieroglyphs, a determinative sign symbolizing the wind,the creative breath and the spur to action (19). It corresponds to the Element ofair. In some mediaeval emblems it appears as an allegory of the Holy Spirit (4).Salamander A mythological fire-spirit, a kind of lizard which was supposedto inhabit the Element of fire (57, 8). In graphic symbolism, and also in alchemy,the salamander signifies fire—which in fact constitutes its general significance.Salvation In numerous legends and stories, and in many myths, situationsare recounted in which ‘salvation’ should occur and frequently does occur. Obvi-ously, this adventure is a profanation of the avatar of the soul on its returnjourney after its ‘fall’ from the paradisiac state. The salvation par excellence isthat occasioned by the Passion of the Lord. However, an association between theideas of sacrifice and salvation is found in many religions.Sandals, Winged An attribute of Mercury, and a symbol of ‘loftiness’ ofspirit in Greek mythology, with the same significance as Pegasus. Perseus put onwinged sandals in order to slay Medusa the Gorgon (15).Sarcophagus Symbolic of the feminine principle and, at the same time, ofthe earth as the beginning and end of material life. Its significance corresponds tothat of the receptacle, the amphora and the boat (9). Hence, in alchemy, it isknown as the ‘philosophical egg’ (or the vessel of transmutation).Zodiacal Signof Sagittarius."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"SATURN278Saturn Saturn symbolizes time which, with its ravenous appetite for life,devours all its creations, whether they are beings, things, ideas or sentiments. Heis also symbolic of the insufficiency, in the mystic sense, of any order of existencewithin the plane of the temporal, or the necessity for the ‘reign of Cronos’ to besucceeded by another cosmic mode of existence in which time has no place. Timebrings restlessness—the sense of duration lasting from the moment of stimulusup to the instant of satisfaction. Hence, Saturn is symbolic of activity, of slow,implacable dynamism, of realization and communication (15); and this is why heis said to have ‘devoured his children’ (32) and why he is related to the Ouroboros(or the serpent which bites its own tail). Other attributes of his are the oar(standing for navigation and progress in things temporal), the hour-glass and thescythe (8). In the scythe we can detect a double meaning: first, its function ofcutting, parallel to and corroborating the symbolism of devouring; and, secondly,its curved shape, which invariably corresponds to the feminine principle. This iswhy the alchemists, masters in the spiritual science of symbolism, named Saturn‘Mercurius senex’: given the androgynous character of Mercury, Saturn takes onSaturn (from Poeticon astronomicon, Venice, 1485)."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"SCALES279the same characteristic ambiguity of gender and sex, and is related to the earth, thesarcophagus and putrefaction, as well as to the colour black. Mertens Stienonsuggests that Saturn is, in every case, a symbol of the law of limitation whichgives shape to life, or the localised expression in time and space of the universallife (40).Saturnalia A characteristic of ancient mythology is the idea that each reignmust give way to another, even on the plane of the divine; it was an idea whichwas inextricably bound up with the notion of life as continuity and succession,and of sacrifice as the sole source of re-creation. The successive cosmic reigns ofUranus, Saturn and Jupiter provided a model for earthly government, for the‘ritual assassination of the king’ at certain astral conjunctions or at the end ofcertain periods, and later for the displacement of this bloody ceremony by itssimulacra. In Rome, the Saturnalia was the most outstanding example of suchsacrifice and simulacra. Frazer notes that it was a general practice in ancient Italyto elect a man to play the part of Saturn and enjoy all the prerogatives of the godfor a while before dying either by his own hand or by sacrifice. The principalfigure in the Carnival festival is a burlesque image and a direct successor of the oldking of the Saturnalia. The ‘King of the Bean’, the mediaeval ‘Bishop of Fools’,the ‘Abbot of Unreason’ and the ‘Lord of Misrule’ are all personifications of oneand the same thing and may well stem from a common source. In every case theyare symbolic of the ideas of duration and sacrifice, whereby, by means of inver-sion and transformation, the brevity and intensity of life may be contrasted withits vulgar mediocrity (21). The Carnival itself is, in its brevity, a symbol of thisdesire to concentrate into a given period of time all the possibilities of existence,apart from the fact that, in its orgiastic sense, it is an invocation of primordialchaos and a desperate quest for the ‘way out of time’.Scales This instrument, of Chaldaean origin (7), is the mystic symbol ofjustice, that is, of the equivalence and equation of guilt and punishment. In em-blems, marks and allegories it is often depicted inside a circle crowned by a fleur-de-lis, a star, a cross or a dove (4). In its most common form, that is, two equalscales balanced symmetrically on either side of a central pivot, it has a secondarymeaning—subservient to the above—which is, to a certain extent, similar to othersymbolic bilateral images, such as the double-bladed axe, the Tree of Life, trees ofthe Sephiroth, etc. The deepest significance of the balance derives from the zodia-cal archetype of Libra, related to ‘immanent justice’, or the idea that all guiltautomatically unleashes the very forces that bring self-destruction and punish-ment (40)."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"SCALES (OF THE FISH)280Scales (of the Fish) On the one hand, they signify protection and defence.On the other, water and the nether world.

The story of theApostles (Acts ix, 18) tells how, when Paul was called by the voice of God, therefell from his eyes ‘as it had been scales’ (50). The scaly pattern on the lower partsof some beings such as mermaids, mermen and Baphomet of the Knights Templarserves to emphasize their association with levelsymbolism, expressing in visualform the cosmic (or moral) inferiority of what, from the viewpoint of vertical‘height’, appears below.Scars Certain elements of reality which are not in themselves symbols, orwhich have not yet been analysed for symbolic significance, nevertheless evi-dently possess such significance. This is sometimes brought to light by theconjunction of several separate events. The author once dreamed of an unknowndamsel (anima) whose beautiful face was marked by scars and burns which in noway disfigured her features. Milton says that Satan’s face ‘deep scars of thunderhad intrenched’. Lacroix, in Rostros de la Fe, states that ‘it is certain that thestigmata of original damnation can sometimes be read in the beautiful faces ofthese coveted objects’. Moral imperfections, and sufferings (are they one and thesame?) are, therefore, symbolized by the wounds and scars caused by fire andsword.Sceptre Related to the magic wand, the club, the thunderbolt and the phallus,as well as to Thor’s hammer. The symbolism of all these falls within the generalgroup of signs and emblems of fertility (31), but it could be linked also to that ofthe ‘world-axis’. In allegories containing the sceptre, the form, colour and materialof the object all play their part in enriching the basic symbolism. One of the mostcommon representations of a sceptre terminates in a fleur-de-lis, which is asymbol of light and purification.Scissors Like the cross, a symbol of ‘conjunction’ (51); but it is also anattribute of the mystic spinners who cut the thread of life of mortal Man. It is,then, an ambivalent symbol expressive of both creation and destruction, birth anddeath.Scorpio The eighth sign of the Zodiac. It corresponds to that period of thespan of man’s life which lies under the threat of death (that is, the ‘fall’). It is alsorelated with the sexual function (40). In the Middle Ages the scorpion makes itsappearance in Christian art as an emblem of treachery and as a symbol for the Jew(20). In the symbolism of megaliths it is the antithesis of the bee whose honeysuccours Man. Finally, its symbolism is equivalent to that of the hangman (51)."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"SEAL OF SOLOMON281Scythe An attribute of Saturn and, in general, linked with allegories of death;it is also associated with Attis and the priests of Cybele, in which case theallusion is to self-mutilation (8). In some images of these deities it is not a largeagricultural scythe that is portrayed but a small dagger curved in shape and calledharpe. Broadly speaking, all curved weapons are lunar and feminine symbols,whereas straight ones are masculine and solar. Straightness signifies penetrationand forcefulness, curves suggest the means to an end and passivity. For thisreason, the harpe has been linked with the ‘indirect way’, that is, with the secretpath which leads to the beyond. According to Diel, the scythe is also symbolic ofthe harvest—of renewed hopes for rebirth. Hence, like Pisces in the Zodiac, thescythe-symbol incorporates the ambiguity of the beginning as the end, and viceversa (15). Both these senses—of mutilation and of hope—are, despite theircontradictory nature, related to the idea of sacrifice inherent in all images ofweapons.Sea The symbolic significance of the sea corresponds to that of the ‘LowerOcean’—the waters in flux, the transitional and mediating agent between the non-formal (air and gases) and the formal (earth and solids) and, by analogy, betweenlife and death. The waters of the oceans are thus seen not only as the source of lifebut also as its goal. ‘To return to the sea’ is ‘to return to the mother’, that is, to die.Seal Like other marks or brands, the seal is a sign of ownership and individu-ality—of differentiation. And, in the form of a seal of beeswax or sealing-wax, itis symbolic of virginity, of narrowmindedness and of repression.Seal of Solomon This consists of two triangles superimposed and inter-laced so as to form a six-pointed star. Wirth terms it the ‘star of the microcosm’,or a sign of the spiritual potential of the individual who can endlessly denyhimself. In reality it is a symbol of the human soul as a ‘conjunction’ of con-sciousness and the unconscious, signified by the intermingling of the triangle(denoting fire) and the inverted triangle (water) (59).

They have also been represented by the figures of animals:Spring as a sheep, Summer as a dragon, Autumn as a hare, Winter as a salamander(8). The four-part division of the seasons enables them to be related also to thepoints of the compass and to the tetramorphs.Sea-urchin Called ‘serpent’s egg’ in Celtic tradition, it is one of the symbolsfor the life-force (26) and the primordial seed.Secret All secrets symbolize the power of the supernatural, and this explainstheir disquieting effect upon most human beings. Jung is emphatic about this,pointing out that, for the same reason, it is very helpful for the individual soaffected to unburden himself of his secrets (31). On the other hand, the ability tomaster this state of tension within oneself confers an awareness of unfailingsuperiority—a sensation which is common in individuals who live outside thelaw and in spies and privy counsellors to kings and magnates. This same notionsupplies part of the basic attraction of esoteric thought and of all forms ofHermetic science in literature and art.Seed Symbolic of latent, non-manifest forces, or of the mysterious potenti-alities the presence of which, sometimes unsuspected, is the justification forhope. These potentialities also symbolize the mystic Centre—the non-apparentpoint which is the irradiating origin of every branch and shoot of the great Tree ofthe World (26).Sefiroth The sum of the ten sefirah, or emanations of God, according to theCabbala (which, in itself, constitutes a mystical and symbolic explanation of theCreation). The sefirah are: Crown, Wisdom, Understanding, Mercy, Justice, Beauty,Firmness, Splendour, Victory, and Kingdom or Shekhinah. There have been at-tempts to identify these aspects of the divine power with the mythologicaldeities which, even in the days of the Roman Empire, were already symbols forthe Stoics, the Neo-Pythagoreans and the Neoplatonists.

Scholem, Professor at the University of Jerusalem. Inanother sense, the syntheses of A.-D. Grad are interesting.Septenary This is an order composed of seven elements. Ultimately, it isfounded upon the seven Directions of Space: two opposite directions for eachdimension, plus the centre. This spatial order of six dynamic elements, plus onewhich is static, is projected into the week as a model of the septenary in thepassage of time. Three is, in many cultures, the number pertaining to heaven(since it constitutes the vertical order of the three-dimensional spatial cross) andfour is associated with the earth (because of the four directions—comparablewith the cardinal points—of the two horizontal dimensions). Hence, seven is thenumber expressing the sum of heaven and earth (as twelve is the expression oftheir multiplicative possibilities) (22). In religion, the septenary is expressed oralluded to by means of ternaries such as the three theological virtues plus thequaternary of the cardinal virtues; the septenary of the capital sins (59), inparticular, is seen in traditional symbolist theory as deriving from the influenceof—or analogy with—the spiritual principles of the seven planets, or the ancientmythological deities. In the heavens, seven finds particular expression in theconstellation of the Pleiades, the daughters of Atlas (six of whom are visible andone hidden) (9). Seven, with its characteristic quality of synthesis, is regarded asa symbol of the transformation and integration of all hierarchical orders as a whole(32); hence there are seven notes in the diatonic scale, seven colours in the rain-bow, and seven planetary spheres together with their seven planets. Sometimes itis taken as being split into—or alternatively as the union of—the numbers twoand five (the Sun and Moon; and Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn), orthree and four (the Sun, Moon and Mercury; and Venus, Mars, Jupiter andSaturn). Seven is represented graphically by the joining of the triangle and thesquare, the triangle being either superimposed upon or inscribed within the square.This septenary pattern is often employed in extensive architectural layouts, forit has a quality of the mandala about it, comparable with the notion of ‘squaringthe circle’. It would be impossible to name, even in brief or in sum, all theinnumerable applications of the septenary, or the ways in which this cosmic‘model’ figures in myths, legends, folktales and dreams, or in historical events,works of art, and so on. At times the seven-scheme takes on a complex symbol-ism—the planetary gods in their evil guise, or the days of the week conceived interms of spiritual peril (in the configuration of the seven-headed dragon); andsometimes it gives expression to the reigning celestial order (as with the seven-branched candelabra in the Temple of Solomon.

It wasfrom its use as a symbol for the complete musical scale (as in Orpheus’ lyre) thatthe number seven came to acquire such widespread application: there were sevenHesperides, seven kings who attacked Thebes and seven who defended it, sevensons and seven daughters of Niobe (38); and Plato conceived of a celestial sirensinging in each of the seven spheres, and these ‘seven Sirens of the Spheres’correspond to the seven virgins in Cinderella (4) and the seven fairies of legendand folklore (one each for each Direction of space and time). For Loeffler, thesefairies correspond to the seven Lipiki of Hindu esoteric thought, that is, thespirits relative to each plane of the human consciousness: sensation, emotion,reflective intelligence, intuition, spirituality, will and intimations of the divine(38). Hence the esoteric conclusion that the human being is composed of sevenspheres after the pattern of the heavens. The Jewish Cabbala provides a linkbetween the mythological deities, in so far as they are creative and beneficient,and the seven celestial hierarchies: the Sun—the angel of light—Michael; theMoon—the angel of hope and dreams—Gabriel; Mercury—the civilizing an-gel—Raphael; Venus—the angel of love—Anael; Mars—the angel of destruc-tion—Samael; Jupiter—the administering angel—Zachariel; Saturn—the angel ofsolicitude—Oriphiel. Lévi has drawn a number of parallels based on the septenary,exactly corresponding to certain elements on all planes of the cosmos. To quoteonly the emblems which he attributes to particular deities: the Sun—a serpentwith a lion’s head; the Moon—a globe divided into two half-moons; Mercury—the Hermetic caduceus; Venus—the lingam; Mars—a dragon biting the hilt of asword; Jupiter—a flaming pentagram in the claws of an eagle; Saturn—an agedman with a scythe (37). It is not too difficult to grasp the significance of numbersbased on the septenary. The vast majority of symbols containing seven elementsall over the world originate from the celestial prototype of the seven spheres.Cola Alberich refers to a number of examples of the number seven appearing as acharacteristic feature of tattoos and amulets. He quotes Hippocrates, for ex-ample: ‘The number seven, because of its occult virtues, tends to bring all thingsinto being: it is the dispenser of life and the source of all change—for the moonitself changes its phase every seven days. This number influences all sublimebeings.’ And Cola Alberich comments that ‘combs with seven points were magicsymbols in Susa; among the Chinese, the “fox with seven tails” is the evil genius;the saints and sages have “seven holes” in their heart; the animal spirits are sevenin number; there are seven fairies of seven colours; on the seventh day of theseventh month, great popular festivals were held all over China, and the mostfavoured of amulets is the lotus with seven leaves.

Serial orders are, then, composed of thedifferentiation of one entity, or the diversification of what is unitary or theunification of what is relatively diverse. Hence we should distinguish in any givenseries: (a) the limits or poles of the series; (b) a limited number of elementsincluded in the series by virtue of their ability to fall into place between the twopoles; (c) an inner graduation which obtains between two or more of theseelements. This graduated scale expresses the relationship between the qualitativeand the quantitative (that is, the potentiality of either to be transformed into theother) as exemplified by the vibratory phenomena of the notes of the musicalscale and the colours of the spectrum. The arrangement of a series in time isequivalent to defining or constituting a process, and this process will be evolutiveif it is ascending, and regressive if it is descending or recurring.Serpent (or Snake) If all symbols are really functions and signs of thingsimbued with energy, then the serpent or snake is, by analogy, symbolic of energyitself—of force pure and simple; hence its ambivalence and multivalencies. An-other reason for its great variety of symbolic meaning derives from the consider-ation that these meanings may relate either to the serpent as a whole or to any ofits major characteristics—for example, to its sinuous movements, its commonassociation with the tree and its formal analogy with the roots and branches of thetree, the way it sheds its skin, its threatening tongue, the undulating pattern of itsbody, its hiss, its resemblance to a ligament, its method of attacking its victims bycoiling itself round them, and so on. Still another explanation lies in its varyinghabitat: there are snakes which inhabit woods, others which thrive in the desert,aquatic serpents and those that lurk in lakes and ponds, wells and springs.

Snakes are guardians of the springs of life andof immortality, and also of those superior riches of the spirit that are symbolizedby hidden treasure (17). As regards the West, Bayley has suggested that thesnake, since its sinuous shape is similar to that of waves, may be a symbol of thewisdom of the deeps (4) and of the great mysteries. Yet, in their multiplicity andas creatures of the desert, snakes are forces of destruction, afflicting all those whohave succeeded in crossing the Red Sea and leaving Egypt (57); in this sense, theyare connected with the ‘temptations’ facing those who have overcome the limita-tions of matter and have entered into the realm of the ‘dryness’ of the spirit. Thisexplains why Blavatsky can say that, physically, the snake symbolizes the se-duction of strength by matter (as Jason by Medea, Hercules by Omphale, Adamby Eve), thereby providing us with a palpable illustration of the workings of theprocess of involution; and of how the inferior can lurk within the superior, or theprevious within the subsequent (9). This is borne out by Diel, for whom thesnake is symbolic not of personal sin but of the principle of evil inherent in allworldly things. The same idea is incorporated into the Nordic myth about theserpent of Midgard (15). There is a clear connexion between the snake and thefeminine principle. Eliade observes that Gresmann (Mytische Reste in derParadieserzahlung, in Archiv f. Rel. X, 345) regarded Eve as an archaic Phoeniciangoddess of the underworld who is personified in the serpent (although a betterinterpretation would be to identify it with the allegorical figure of Lilith, theenemy and temptress of Eve). In support of this, Eliade points to the numerousMediterranean deities who are represented carrying a snake in one or both of theirhands (for example, the Greek Artemis, Hecate, Persephone), and he relates theseto the finely sculpted Cretan priestesses in gold or ivory, and to mythic figureswith snakes for hair (Medusa the Gorgon, or the Erinyes). He goes on to mentionthat in Central Europe there is a belief that hairs pulled out from the head of awoman under the influence of the moon will be turned into snakes (17). Theserpent (or snake) was very common in Egypt; the hieroglyph which corre-sponds phonetically to the letter Z is a representation of the movement of thesnake. Like the sign of the slug, or horned snake (phonetically equivalent to F),this hieroglyph refers to primigenial and cosmic forces. Generally speaking, thenames of the goddesses are determined by signs representing the snake—which istantamount to saying that it is because of Woman that the spirit has fallen intomatter and evil. The snake is also used, as are other reptiles, to refer to theprimordial—the most primitive strata of life.

The demonic implications of the serpent areexemplified in Tuat, whose evil spirits are portrayed as snakes; however, these—like the vanquished dragon—may also take on a beneficent form as forces whichhave been mastered, controlled, sublimated and utilized for the superior purposesof the psyche and the development of mankind, and in this sense they correspondto the goddesses Nekhebit and Uadjit (or Buto). They also become an Uraeus—the same thing happens in the symbolism of the Kundalini—constituting themost precious ornament of the royal diadem (19).As we have said, it is the basic characteristics of the snake which havedetermined its symbolic significances. To quote Teillard’s definition of the snake,it is: ‘An animal endowed with magnetic force. Because it sheds its skin, itsymbolizes resurrection. Because of its sinuous movement’ (and also because itscoils are capable of strangling) ‘it signifies strength. Because of its viciousness, itrepresents the evil side of nature’ (56). Its ability to shed its skin greatly im-pressed ancient writers: Philo of Alexandria believed that when the snake shakesoff its skin it likewise shakes off its old age, that it can both kill and cure and thatit is therefore the symbol and attribute of the aggressive powers, positive andnegative, which rule the world. (This is a Gnostic and Manichean idea of Persianprovenance.) He decided finally that it is the ‘most spiritual of animals’. Jung haspointed out that the Gnostics related it to the spinal cord and the spinal marrow,an excellent image of the way the unconscious expresses itself suddenly andunexpectedly with its peremptory and terrible incursions (31). He adds that,psychologically, the snake is a symptom of anguish expressive of abnormal stirringsin the unconscious, that is, of a reactivation of its destructive potentiality. This isdirectly comparable to the significance of the serpent of Midgard in Norse my-thology. In the Völuspa it is proclaimed that the deluge will commence when theserpent awakens to destroy the universe (31). For Zimmer, the serpent is thelifeforce which determines birth and rebirth and hence it is connected with theWheel of Life. The legend of Buddha tells how the serpent wound itself round hisbody seven times (as in the effigies of the Mithraic Cronos), but, since it couldnot crush him, it turned into a youth bowing low before Gautama (60).The connexion of the snake with the wheel is expressed in graphic form in theGnostic symbol of the Ouroboros, or serpent biting its own tail; half of thismythic being is dark and the other half light (as in the Chinese Yang-Yin symbol),which clearly illustrates the essential ambivalence of the snake in that it pertainsto both aspects of the cycle (the active and the passive, the affirmative and thenegative, the constructive and the destructive). Wirth comments that the ‘ancientserpent is the prop of the world, providing it with both materials and energy,"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"SERPENT288unfolding as reason and imagination, and also as a force of the darkness’ (59). Thesnake was an important symbol for the Gnostics, and especially for the so-calledNaassene sect (from naas—snake). Hippolytus, criticizing this doctrine, as-serted that the snake was said to live in all objects and in all beings. This brings usto the Yoga concept of the Kundalini or the snake as an image of inner strength.Kundalini is represented symbolically as a snake coiled up upon itself in the formof a ring (kundala) (29), in that subtle part of the organism corresponding to thelower extremity of the spinal column; this, at any rate, is the case with theordinary man. But, as a result of exercises directed towards his spiritualization—Hatha Yoga, for instance—the snake uncoils and stretches up through wheels(chakras) corresponding to the various plexuses of the body until it reaches thearea of the forehead corresponding to the third eye of Shiva. It is then, accordingto Hindu belief, that man recovers his sense of the eternal (28). The symbolismhere probably relates to an ascending force, rising up, that is, from the areagoverned by the sexual organ up to the realm of thought—an interpretation whichit is also possible to justify by simple reference to the symbolism of level, takingthe heart as central. In other words, the symbol denotes ‘sublimation of thepersonality’ (Avalon, The Serpent Power). Jung has noted that the custom ofrepresenting transformation and renovation of figures of snakes constitutes awell-documented archetype; and he suggests that the Egyptian Uraeus is thevisible expression of the Kundalini on a higher plane (32). There are also variousrites which accord with this concept of progressive elevation. The progress throughthe six chakras—there is in fact a seventh, but it is unnamed and (like the centralpoint of certain mandala-like patterns) is not represented visually—may be re-garded as analogous to climbing up the terraces of the ziggurat or mounting thesteps pertaining to the seven metals in the Mithraic ritual (11). Apart from thecircular (and cosmic) position it tends to take up, and the quality of completenesswhich this implies, the snake is frequently related to other symbols. The mostcommon of these is the tree, which, being unitary, may be said to correspond tothe masculine principle, in which case the ophidian would represent the feminine.The tree and the serpent are, in mythology, prefigurations of Adam and Eve.Furthermore, by analogy, we also have here a situation of symbolic Entangle-ment—the snake curled round the tree (or round the staff of Aesculapius)—anda symbolic image of moral dualism. Diel, who tends to favour this kind of inter-pretation, suggests that the snake coiled round the staff or club of the god ofmedicine recalls the basic, Biblical symbol of the Tree of Life encircled by thesnake and signifying the principle of evil; the pattern here points to the closerelationship between life and corruption as the source of all evil. Diel goes on to"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"SERPENT289suggest that it is this subversion of the spirit that brings about the death of thesoul, and that this is what medicine must, in the first place, set out to combat (15).Now, the opposite to the encircling (or triumphant) snake is the crucifiedsnake, as it is to be found among the figures included in Abraham le Juif (Paris,Bibl. Nat. Ms. Fr. 14765, of the 16th century) (32). This figure of the reptilenailed to a cross—or the chthonian and feminine principle vanquished by thespirit—is also represented mythically by the victory of eagle over serpent. HeinrichZimmer recalls that, in the Iliad, an eagle appears to the Greeks, carrying awounded snake in its claws. The seer Calchas saw this as an omen portending thetriumph of the Greeks (the masculine and patriarchal order of the Aryans subdu-ing the predominantly feminine and matriarchal principle of Asia) (60). Since allstruggle is a form of ‘conjunction’ and therefore of love, it is hardly surprising thatman should have created a synthesis of opposing powers—heaven and earth—inthe image of the ‘plumed serpent’, the most notable symbol of pre-ColumbianAmerica. This serpent has feathers on its head, in its tail and sometimes on itsbody. Quetzalcoatl is another androgynous symbol of this kind (41). The sym-metrical placing of two serpents, as in the caduceus of Mercury, is indicative of anequilibrium of forces, of the counterbalancing of the cowed serpent (or subli-mated power) by the untamed serpent, so representing good balanced by evil,health by sickness. As Jung has shrewdly observed, this much-used image is anadumbration of homoeopathy—a cure effected by what caused the ailment. Theserpent therefore becomes the source of the healing of the wound caused by theserpent. This is why it could serve as a symbol of St. John the Evangelist (32) andappear in association with a chalice.The different forms which the serpent may take are not numerous. The sea-serpent seems simply to emphasize the integration of the symbolism of theunconscious with that of the abyss (9). If it has more than one head, this merelyserves to add to the basic symbolism, the extra significance corresponding to theparticular number of heads it is given. The dragon or the serpent with seven headsoccurs often in legends, myths and folktales simply because seven representsmultiplication of unity and locates the reptile among the essential orders of thecosmos. The seven-headed serpent partakes of the symbolism of the seven Di-rections of Space, the seven days of the week, and the seven planetary gods, andhas a bearing upon the seven sins (9). The three-headed serpent refers to the threeprinciples of the active, the passive and the neutral. In alchemy, the wingedserpent represents the volatile principle, and the wingless the fixed principle. Thecrucified serpent denotes the fixation of the volatile and also sublimation (as inthe Prometheus myth). Alchemists also saw in the serpent an illustration of ‘the"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"SEXES, THE290feminine in Man’ or his ‘humid essence’, relating the reptile to Mercury (57) asthe androgynous god who—like Shiva—was doubtless endowed with a tendencytowards both good and evil (an aspect also portrayed by the Gnostics in theirtwin serpents called Agathodaemon and Kakodaemon) (9). There are also ser-pents of unusual aspect—the snake with a sheep’s head, for instance, in reliefs oncertain Gallo-Roman sepulchres. In view of the favourable symbolic sense of thesheep (connected with Aries, spring, initiation and fire), this adaptation implies adegree of spiritualization (16). Finally, according to Schneider, the sacrificedserpent is the symbolic equivalent of the swan’s neck and of the swan itself (andit is by the swan that the hero is wafted heavenwards, plucking away upon hisharp) (50). That is to say, the sacrifice of the serpent (as a life-force) makes itpossible to accept death gratefully (like the swan) and to soar up to higherregions. Father Heras has suggested that the snake is symbolic of fertility anddestruction and that it is in this sense that it appears on the menhir of Kernuz(Finistère). It appears in opposition to the arrow in the effigy of the horned godof Cerdeña (with another head on top alluding to the symbolism of the Gemini).Sexes, The Plato, in Timaeus, speaks of the sexes as ‘living’, as if in someway they were independent of the beings to which they pertain. This is visuallysymbolized by the ventral faces given to some of the fabulous mediaeval figures,as well as by the paws added to the heads of the gryces, deriving from ancientCarthaginian and Gnostic images. Now, orthodox Freudians have reduced thegreat majority of objects, depending upon whether their predominant character-istic is that of the container or the contained, to either feminine or masculinesexual implications; but there is nothing new in this, for implicit in the ancientChinese Yang-Yin symbol is the notion of a classification whereby all things fallwithin a system which locates the genders at opposite poles, corresponding tothe duality of the sexes. We must not overlook that the sexes may symbolizespiritual principles; consciousness and the unconscious, heaven and earth, fireand water. The sexual conjunctio is the most graphic and impressive of all imagesexpressive of the idea of union, and hence alchemists used it to represent initia-tory truths which transcend the laws of biology, as Jung has demonstrated,particularly in Psychology of the Transference.Shadow As the Sun is the light of the spirit, so shadow is the negative‘double’ of the body, or the image of its evil and base side. Among primitivepeoples, the notion that the shadow is the àlter ego or soul is firmly established;it is also reflected in the folklore and literature of some advanced cultures (35). AsFrazer has noted, the primitive often regards his shadow, or his reflection in water"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"SHAPE291or in a mirror, as his soul or as a vital part of himself (21). ‘Shadow’ is the termgiven by Jung to the primitive and instinctive side of the individual.Shape (or Form) Certain branches of science, such as the Psychology ofForm, Isomorphism and Morphology, have arrived at conclusions which coincidewith those of traditional symbolism. The most comprehensive and valid defini-tion of the significance of form is that which appears in the legendary TabulaSmaragdina: ‘What is above is like what is below’, which Goethe confirmed andbettered by adding: ‘What is within’—the idea—’is also without’—form. Hence,Paul Guillaume has been able to declare that ‘the terms of shape, structure andorganization pertain not only to the language of biology (that is, forms) but alsoto psychology (that is, thought or ideas) . . .’ and that ‘isomorphism, propound-ing a theory of form which revives the ancient tradition of parallelism (or magicanalogy), refuses to draw a dividing line between spirit and tune’. This observa-tion is rounded off with the observation that ‘shapes correspond, in our percep-tion and thought, to comparable forms in the nervous processes’; hence, what iscircular is equivalent both to the circle and to the cyclic, and the square is identicalwith things quaternary and also with the number four (50), so that form takes itsplace as the ‘intermediary between spirit and matter’ (57). In the broadest sense,then, we may conclude that a preference for regular shapes indicates ‘regulated’ orwell-ordered sentiments, whereas irregular forms suggest ‘unregulated’ sentiments.Oval shapes are related to things biomorphic; cubes with the artificial and theconstructional; simple shapes with what is straightforward; and complex shapeswith what is complicated. The same applies to rhythms, structures and compo-sitions. There are other general principles too, such as that which equates sym-metry with equilibrium and with the static; asymmetry with dynamism; absoluteregularity and, likewise, absolute irregularity with chaos, in so far as they are.both expressions of the undifferentiated: differentiation is brought about by ritual,that is, by the organization of regularized irregularity. Examples of morphologicalanalyses may be taken over and applied to the symbolic; to take one example: in"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"SHAPE292the phenomenon of growth, the circular or irradiating form signifies, in symbolicterms, the regular force of diffusion, the existence of a centre as the ‘Origin’, anda uniform pattern of resistance. These laws are equally true of the spirit. Formswhich, within a given system or group, are different one from the other may beordered in a series or in a scale (or within orders of analogies and correspon-dences). So, the trapezium, the rectangle, the square, the circle represent a serieswhich progresses from irregularity to regularity, a series which could equally wellapply to moral evolution. Jung touches upon this question, commenting that thesquare, as the minimal composite number (symbolizing a situation), representsthe pluralist or inner state of the man who is not yet at one with himself. And yetthe square is superior to the trapezium, just as the trapezium is superior to thetrapezoid. The octagon is the ‘intervening figure’ (or the intermediary) betweenthe square and the circle. It is unnecessary to emphasize that the meaning of asymbol varies from plane to plane, notably on the psychological and cosmicplanes. So, for example, from the psychological point of view, the triangle, in itsnatural position with the apex uppermost, when placed between the square andthe circle, is expressive of communication. But, objectively speaking, these threefigures symbolize the relationship (represented by the triangle) between earth(the square) and heaven (the circle, the wheel, or rose-window); this explains whythese are the essential symbols of so many Cistercian and Gothic façades. An-other law to be taken into account is that forms explain objects, and objectsforms; that is to say, the symbolic meaning of a being or figure is usually con-firmed and emphasized by the significance of its shape, the converse also beingtrue. Gothic spires are related to the pyramid, therefore the pyramid is related toGothic spires. In India, geometric forms have the following cosmic implications:The sphere is associated with the ether or heaven; the crescent with air; thepyramid, fire; the cube, earth (4). The analysis of the symbolism of geometricshapes has been carried to excess by some writers—Piobb among them. Star, forexample, proposes the following correspondences: the sphere, intellectual life,pure thought, and abstraction; the cone, a synthesis of all other shapes and asymbol for psychic wholeness; the cylinder, material thoughts and the mechanis-tic intellect (55). In general, flat shapes have a more spiritual character thanshapes with bulk, but the latter are linked more closely with the macrocosmos. Itis unnecessary to emphasize that, in the symbolism of shape—even when three-dimensional—the diagrammatic cross-section or groundplan is of the essence.Thus, to take the cathedral as an example, the figure of the cross, that is, of theground-plan, takes precedence over the temple/mountain symbolism derivingfrom the irregularly ascending pyramid-shape without neutralizing its effect."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"SHELL293Another factor of importance is number-symbolism: for example, two towers,over and above the inherent symbolism of towers, of prisms and cylinders,embrace a meaning which springs from their duality. For this reason, most reli-gious edifices shun the number two (since it implies conflict) and turn to thenumber three (implying resolution, quite apart from the fact that it is the image ofthe Trinity), and the two bell-towers of the façade are completed by the cimborrioabove the transept. The circle and the square stand for limitlessness and limita-tion respectively.Sheaf In Egyptian hieroglyphics, a determinative sign defining the conceptof limitation (19).Sheaf (or Bundle) Eliade points out that the Latin fascis (sheaf or bundle)and fascia (band, sash, or bandage) are related to fascinum (fascination or evil-doing); they are words which fall within the vast symbolic group composed ofbindings, knots, bows, plaits, ropes and cords, all of which allude to ‘being tiedto’ existence (18). But this is to explain only the negative side of the symbol. Likemost symbols, it tends to ambivalence, and in the positive sense, the sheafsymbolizes unification, integration and strength.Shekhinah This is not a symbol but a Cabbalistic sefirah. It represents thefeminine aspect of the Supreme Being, i.e., to quote Jungian terminology, hisanima, of which all such souls as the young woman, the stranger, the beloved, aremirrors. The never-ending search for the ideal through a multiplicity of womenmust represent the search for the Shekhinah, either through the images of theanima or simply through women’s powers of carnal seduction which, accordingto the Book of Henoch, even tempted some of the angels themselves. The rejec-tion of the woman—as exemplified by Hamlet’s spurning of Ophelia—might, insuch a context, represent a longing to return to the angelic state, to escape fromthe merely human condition by an opposite route to that of conjunctio. GershomG. Scholem, in On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism (London, 1965), says that theShekhinah may contain aspects which are negative, occult and destructive, andthis leads one by another path to the Hindu trinity, in which Siva (or Shiva)symbolizes the destructive side of the deity. It should not be forgotten that, inthis case, destruction is only concerned with the phenomenic side of beings, and,in reality, it is transformation, renovation and rebirth.Shell One of the eight emblems of good luck in Chinese Buddhism, found inallegories about royalty, and also a sign for a prosperous journey (5). Thisfavourable implication is the result of the shell’s association with water, thesource of fertility. According to Eliade, shells are also related to the moon and toWoman. Pearl-symbolism also is very closely linked with the shell. The mythic"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"SHEPHERD294birth of Aphrodite from a shell is of obvious relevance (18). In Schneider’s view,the shell is the mystic symbol of the prosperity of one generation rising out of thedeath of the preceding generation (5). In all probability, its favourable meaningis—as in the case of the well and the bottle—a consequence of the thirsty travel-ler or pilgrim linking the shell in his mind with the presence of water; this wouldexplain its significance in mediaeval allegories.Shepherd The title given to the lunar god Tammuz (or Thammuz) as theshepherd of the ‘flocks’ of the stars. According to Krappe, this idea is closelybound up with the passion of Tammuz (as Adonis) for Aphrodite (or Ishtar),because of the relationship between the phases of the moon and dismemberment(35). The shepherd is also the conductor of souls to the Land of the Dead—thepsychopomp, and a symbol of supreme power, since flocks are representative ofthe cosmic forces.Shield The symbolic significance of the shield amounts to a simple transpo-sition of its defensive function to the spiritual plane. The fact that coats-of-armswere generally emblazoned upon shields yields an additional meaning which maybe interpreted as implying that the knight defends himself by displaying hisidentity and invoking it in the hour of peril.Ship On coins, a ship ploughing through the seas is emblematic of joy andhappiness (8). But the most profound significance of navigation is that impliedby Pompey the Great in his remark: ‘Living is not necessary, but navigation is.’By this he meant that existence is split up into two fundamental structures:living, which he understood as living for or in oneself, and sailing or navigating, bywhich he understood living in order to transcend—or what Nietzsche from hispessimistic angle called ‘living in order to disappear’. The Odyssey is, basically,nothing but a navigation-myth in the sense of victory over the two essential perilsof all sailing: destruction (or the triumph of the ocean—corresponding to theunconscious) and withdrawal (regression or stagnation). Yet Homer reserves theend of the periplus of Odysseus for a triumphant but affectionate ‘return’ to hiswife, his hearth and home. This is a mystic idea analogous to the mystery of the‘fall’ of the soul into the material plane of existence (by the process of involution)and to the necessity of its returning to the starting-point (evolution)—a mysterywhich has been expounded by Platonic idealism and by Plotinus in particular.This law of the returning soul corresponds to the belief in the concept of a‘closed’ universe (like that of the Eternal Return) or the conception of all phe-nomena as a cyclic organization. Navigation, as envisaged in any philosophy ofthe absolute, would deny even the hero his triumphant return to the homelandand would make of him a perpetual explorer of oceans, under endless skies. But"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"SHOES295to come back to the symbolism of the ship, every vessel corresponds to a constel-lation (48). The ship-symbol has been related to the holy island, in so far as bothare differentiated from the amorphous and hostile sea. If the waters of the oceansare symbolic of the unconscious, they also can allude to the dull roar of theoutside world. The notion that it is essential first to learn to sail the sea of thepassions in order to reach the Mountain of Salvation is the same as the ideamentioned earlier in connexion with the perils of exploring the oceans. For thisreason Guénon suggests that ‘the attainment of the Great Peace is depicted in theform of sailing the seas’; hence, in Christian symbolism, the ship represents theChurch (28). Some of the less clearly defined aspects of the symbolism of theship—comparable here with the small boat and the carriage—are related to sym-bols of the human body and of all physical bodies or vehicles; in addition to this,there is a cosmic implication deriving from the age-old comparison between thesun and the moon on the one hand, and, on the other, two ships floating upon thecelestial ocean. The solar ship frequently appears on Egyptian monuments. InAssyrian art, too, ships shaped like cups are clearly solar in character; this cup-shape narrows down still further the scope of the meaning (35). Another meaning,sometimes quite independent of the foregoing, derives not so much from the ideaof the ship as such but rather from the notion of sailing; this is the symbolism ofthe Ship-of-Death. Hence, many primitive peoples place ships on the end of apole or on the roof of a house. On occasion, it is the roof itself (of the temple orhouse) which is made to resemble a ship. Always the implication is the desire totranscend existence—to travel through space to the other worlds. All these forms,then, represent the axis valley-mountain, or the symbolism of verticality and theidea of height. An obvious association here is with all the symbols for the world-axis. The mast in the centre of the vessel gives expression to the idea of theCosmic Tree incorporated within the symbolism of the Ship-of-Death or ‘Ship ofTranscendence’ (50).Ship of Fools This symbol is fairly common in mediaeval iconography andis related to the Biblical ‘foolish virgins’. It expresses the idea of ‘sailing’ as an endin itself, as opposed to the true sense of ‘sailing’, which is transition, evolutionand salvation, or safe arrival at the haven. Hence, illustrations of stultifera navisusually showed a naked woman, a wine-glass and other allusions to terrestrialdesires. The Ship of Fools is, then, a parallel symbol to that of the AccursedHunter.Shoes According to Swedenborg, shoes symbolize the ‘lowly nature’, in thesense both of the humble and the despicable (4). Shoes are also a symbol of the"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"SIEVE296female sex organ and may have this implication in the story of Cinderella. For theancients, they were a sign denoting liberty.Sieve In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, the sign representing a cribbleor sieve symbolizes the means of selecting the particular forces needed to reach arequired synthesis. The deepest significance of this symbol alludes—like allalchemic experiments—to work carried out upon oneself. The concepts hereinvolved fall within the ambit of the Greek maxim ‘know thyself’, but the crite-rion is concerned more with action than with speculation (19). To sieve is topurify and to perfect, to garner the useful, and to discard the useless.Sigma The S-shape, both vertical and horizontal, together with all its derivedforms known generically in the art of ornamentation as scrolls, symbolize rela-tionship and movement or the underlying rhythm of apparently continuous mo-tion. As Ortiz has noted, sigmoid signs, like the spiral, have been utilized assymbols of the wind, but they are more properly related to the whirlwind orwhirlpool. The double, symmetrical spiral (like the Ionic volute) may, accordingto a suggestion of Breuil, be a stylized image of the bull’s horns. The curvedswastika is composed of two intersecting sigmas (41). A different, wider anddeeper implication of the sigma (closely connected, however, with the symbol-ism of the whirlwind and the hurricane as a synthesis of the Elements and as thesupreme cosmic ‘moment’) is afforded by Schneider’s suggestion that the sigma,especially in its vertical position, is a representation of the stream winding itsway down the mountain-side and so constituting a characteristic symbol of thevalley-mountain axis (or earth-heaven, or, in other words, the hieros gamos). Hefurther suggests that this S-shape seems to be formed by one waning moon plusanother waxing: the symbols for the two alternating phases of the evolutive andinvolutive processes which govern the sacrificial relationship of earth and heaven.He believes that this is the explanation of the frequency of the sigma in primitiveornamentation (50).Sign According to Raymond Lull, ‘meaning is the revelation of secretsthrough the sign’, a thesis which puts the emphasis upon the sign as a fact, as areality. On the other hand, for Stanislas de Guaita (Essais de Sciences maudites,II, Paris, 1915) the sign is the ‘point of reference needed by the will (or con-science) in projecting itself towards a predetermined goal’. The sign, then, is theconcrete form, the symptom, of an invisible, an inner reality and, at the sametime, the means whereby the mind is reminded of that reality. Determination andmeaning are immanent in the sign. The occult theory of ‘signatures’ conceiveseverything that exists as a sign and holds that everything has a feasible ‘reading’(the shape of a tree, the position of three or more rocks on a plain, the colour of"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"SIREN297some eyes, marks made by natural forces on a natural or artificial terrain, thestructure of a landscape, the pattern of a constellation, etc.). Auguste Rodin, arealist who was always hovering on the borders of symbolism, in his Conversa-tions collected by Paul Gsell, places all art within this realm of occult meaning,with the words: ‘lines and shades are for us nothing more than the signs of ahidden reality. Beyond the surface, our gaze plunges into the spirit’. The painterGustave Moreau expressed himself in similar terms when referring to ‘the evoca-tion of thought by line, arabesque and plastic means’. In the present century, MaxErnst and Dubuffet, among other artists, have explained their pictorial and graphicexperiments as an immersion in the psychic projected onto the material. At thesame time, C. G. Jung gives a similar explanation of the quest of the alchemists.Siren A symbolic figure which usually takes one of two main forms: as abird-woman or as a fish-woman. The sirens in Greek mythology were supposedto be daughters of the river Achelous by the nymph Calliope; and Ceres turnedthem into birds. They inhabited mountainous places. Legend attributed to them asong of such sweetness they could entice the wayfarer, only to devour him.Latterly, the myth arose of sirens with fish-tails whose haunts were rocky islandsand cliffs and who behaved in the same manner as did their sisters inhabiting theElement of air. The siren-myth is one of the most indestructible of all myths;among some marine peoples it has persisted even into the present day (8). Mate-rial concerning these sirens is to be found in Aristotle, Pliny, Ovid, Hyginus, thePhysiologus (2nd century A.D.) and mediaeval bestiaries. Dating from before the10th century are the two-tailed sirens on the tympanum of the chapel of St.Michael d’Aiguilhe at Le Puy, and the siren-birds at Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire. TheseTwin-tailed siren (15th century)."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"SKELETON298and the French viperfairies—as exemplified by Melusina in particular—are com-plex figures and we are not satisfied that a merely literal interpretation is the rightone. They may well be representations of the inferior forces in woman, or ofwoman as the inferior, as in the case of lamias; or they could also be symbolic ofthe corrupt imagination enticed towards base ends or towards the primitive strataof life; or of the torment of desire leading to self-destruction, for their abnormalbodies cannot satisfy the passions that are aroused by their enchanting music andby their beauty of face and bosom. It seems that they are largely symbols of the‘temptations’ scattered along the path of life (or of symbolic navigation) imped-ing the evolution of the spirit by bewitchment, beguiling it into remaining on themagic island; or, in other words, causing its premature death. The twin-tailedsiren (a fine example of which may be seen on a capital in the apse of San Cugatmonastery) can be explained psychologically as a simple amalgamation: the twolegs of woman applied to the single tail of the fish giving the twin-tail of thewomanfish; but it may also be interpreted symbolically by reference to theprofound significance of the Gemini. It seems to us that the twin tail is an infernalreplica of the classical attitude of adoration in which both arms are raised—anattitude characteristic, for example, of the Cretan statuettes of priestesses. Giventhat the sea is the lower abyss and an image of the unconscious, then the twinfish-tail, pertaining to the sea, must express a duality (or conflict) within thewatery deeps. Wirth maintains that the siren is quite simply a symbol of woman,and that woman is a true incarnation of the spirit of the earth, as opposed to theman, who is the son of heaven. He expresses his concept of transmigration asfollows: ‘Life entices the souls of those deprived of it. Why does the other worldnot retain once and for all those spiritual entities that aspire towards reincarna-tion? The daughters of men ensnare the sons of heaven with their beauty, draggingthem irresistibly down. The spell thus cast is attributed to the siren whose songso captivates the listener that he falls into the ocean’ (of the lower waters and ofnascent forms) ‘teeming with multitudinous life. This temptress owes her pow-ers to the changing forms governed by the moon, the crescent of which shinesupon her forehead’ (59) (Plates XXIII and XXIV).Skeleton In the majority of allegories and emblems it is the personificationof death. In alchemy it is a symbol of the colour black and of the putrefaction or‘disjunction’ of the component elements.Skin Skin is associated with the ideas of birth and rebirth. In the Egyptiansystem of hieroglyphs there is a determinative sign comprising three skins knot-ted together, signifying ‘to be born’; it comes into the composition of words suchas ‘to engender’, ‘to bring up’, ‘child’, ‘to form’. The amulet which the Egyptians"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"SMOKE299used to present to the newly-born comprised, like the hieroglyph, three animalpelts which were attached to a solar globe. The number of the skins here refers tothe essentially threefold nature of the human being—the body, the soul and thespirit—while the globe denotes his incorporation into the All. The symbolism ofskin is borne out by the rite known as ‘the passage through the skin’ whichpharaohs and priests used to carry out in order to rejuvenate themselves; this ritewas later replaced by a simulacrum, and then latterly it became just a panther’stail which kings wore knotted round their waist. This notion that an individualmay assume the characteristics of an animal, with its totemic implications, alsocomes into skin-symbolism (19). There is a basic analogy here with the sacrificialrite once practised by the priests of pre-Columbian Mexico in which humanvictims were clad in skins; similarly with the wearing of skins by the bearers ofthe signum in Roman legions.Skull Broadly speaking, it is an emblem of the mortality of man, as in theliterary examples of Hamlet and Faust. However, like the snail’s shell, it is intruth ‘what survives’ of the living being once its body has been destroyed. Ittherefore comes to acquire significance as a receptacle for life and for thought, itis with this symbolic meaning that it figures in books on alchemy, where it isrepresented as the receptacle used in the processes of transmutation (32). A greatmany forms of superstition, ritual and—indeed—of cannibalism, are derivedfrom this idea.Sleeping Beauty On the one hand she may be regarded as a symbol of theanima in the Jungian sense. On the other she symbolizes, rather than the uncon-scious proper, the ancestral images which lie dormant in the unconscious, waitingto be stimulated into action. As Loeffler points out, in fairy-tales and legendsprincesses lie dreaming in their palaces, like memories and intuitions deep downin our unconscious. The princesses in their palaces, though not always asleep, areinvariably outside the world of action, so that every sleeping, or otherwise se-cluded, princess stands for a passive potential (38).Slug The sign denoting the slug—sometimes also interpreted as a smallsnake—symbolizes the male seed, the Origin of life, the silent tendency of dark-ness to move towards light; this concept is well expressed in Chapter 17 of theBook of the Dead (19).Smoke The antithesis of mud, since mud combines the Elements of earth andwater, whereas smoke corresponds to air and fire. There are some folklore tradi-tions which attribute a beneficent power to smoke, which is supposed to possessthe magic ability to ward off the misfortunes that beset men, animals and plants(21). On the other hand, the column of smoke is a symbol of the valley-mountain"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"SNAIL300antithesis, that is, of the relationship between earth and heaven, pointing out thepath through fire to salvation (17). According to Geber, the alchemist, smokesymbolizes the soul leaving the body.Snail In Egyptian hieroglyphics the snail is associated with the action of themicrocosmic spiral upon matter (19). Modern scientific research in morphologytends to verify this intuition, not only in this particular case but also in all caseswhere the spiral scheme appears in nature.Sophia Woman as anima (the soul of man) and as spiritual guide. Accordingto the Gnostic Ptolemaeus, in his Letter to Flora, Sophia is the intermediarybetween the soul of the world (the demiurge) and ideas (pleroma) or plenitude, amass of aeons opposed to the world of phenomena. For the 17th-century mys-tics Jakob Böhme and Georg Gichtel, Sophia, the divine virgin, was originallyfound in ‘primordial man’ (see Eliade, Méphistophélès et l’androgyne, Paris, 1962).She abandoned him, and man cannot be saved until he finds her again. This idea,which is related to the Persian idea of the loved one (Daena), was taken up by theCatharists; it also colours romantic thought (as in Novalis, Hölderlin, Poe, Wagner).A brutally figurative allegory of the idea is furnished by the Greek myth ofAthene born from the head of Zeus (i.e. the virgin = thought).Sorcerer Like the giant and the magician, he is a personification of theTerrible Father, of the ‘evil demiurge’ of the Gnostics, prefigured in Saturn (31).Sound In India, the sound of Krishna’s flute is the magical cause of the birthof the world. The pre-Hellenic maternal goddesses are depicted holding lyres, andwith the same significance (56). There are other traditional doctrines which holdthat sound was the first of all things to be created, and that which gave rise to allothers, commencing with light, or, alternatively, with air and fire. An instance ofthis is the lament quoted in the Poimandres of Hermes Trismegistos (31).Space In a manner of speaking, space is an intermediate zone between thecosmos and chaos. Taken as the realm of all that is possible, it is chaotic; regardedas the region in which all forms and structures have their existence, it is cosmic.Space soon came to be associated with time, and this association proved one ofthe ways of coming to grips with the recalcitrant nature of space. Another—andthe most important—was the concept of space as a three-part organization basedupon its three dimensions. Each dimension has two possible directions of move-ment, implying the possibility of two poles or two contexts. To the six pointsachieved in this way, there was added a seventh: the centre; and space thusbecame a logical structure. The symbolisms of level and of orientation werefinally brought to bear in order to complete the exegesis. The three dimensions ofspace are illustrated by means of a three-dimensional cross, whose arms are"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"SPACE301oriented along these six spatial directions, made up of the four points of thecompass plus the two points of the zenith and the nadir. According to RenéGuénon, this symbolism—because of its structural character—is identical withthat of the Sacred Palace (or the inner palace) of the Cabala, located at the centre-point from which the six directions radiate. In the three-dimensional cross, thezenith and the nadir correspond to the top and the bottom, the front and back toEast and West, the right and left to the South and North. The upright axis is thepolar axis, the North-South axis is the solstitial line, the East-West the equinoc-tial. The significance of the vertical or level-symbolism concerns the analogybetween the high and the good, the low and the inferior. The Hindu doctrine of thethree gunas—sattva (height, superiority), rajas (intermediate zone of the worldof appearances, or ambivalence) and tamas (inferiority, or darkness)—is in itselfsufficient to explain the meaning of the symbolism of level up and down thevertical axis. It is, in consequence, the intermediate plane of the four-directionalcross (that which incorporates the cardinal points and which implies the square)which represents the world of appearances. Taking next the East-West axis,traditional orientation-symbolism associates the East—being the point of sun-rise—with spiritual illumination; and the West—the point where the sun sets—with death and darkness. Passing next to the North-South axis, there is no onedefinite interpretation. In many oriental cultures, the zenith coincides with themystic ‘Hole’ through which transition and transcendence are effected, that is,the path from the world of manifestation (spatial and temporal) to that of eter-nity. But it has also been identified with the centre of the three-dimensional cross,taken as the heart of space. Reduced to two dimensions—those of the contrastinghorizontal and vertical arms—the cross comes to represent harmony betweenextension (associated with width) and exaltation (with height). The horizontalarm concerns the implications of a given gradation or moment in an individual’sexistence, and the vertical pertains to moral elevation (25). William of Saint-Thierry, describing the seven gradations of the soul, observes that it ascends thesesteps in order to reach the celestial life (14). If we seek an interpretation whichwill justify the four points of the horizontal plane’s being reduced to two (the leftand right), we can find a basis for it in Jung’s assertion that the rear part coincideswith the unconscious and the front with the manifest or consciousness; and sincethe left also can be equated with the unconscious and the right with conscious-ness, the rear then becomes equivalent to the left and the front to the right (32).Other equivalents are: left side with the past, the sinister, the repressed, involu-tion, the abnormal and the illegitimate; the right side with the future, the felici-tous, openness, evolution, the normal and the legitimate (42). In all this, there is"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"SPACE302an apparent contradiction with the corresponding number-symbolisms: Panethobserves that, in most cultures, the uneven numbers are considered to be mascu-line and the even numbers to be feminine. Since the left side is the zone of originand the right that of the outcome, the corresponding number-symbolisms wouldseem to be one (the uneven or masculine number) for the left side (that is, thepast) and two (the even or feminine number) for the right side (the subsequent oroutcome). The solution is to be found in the fact that the number one (unity)never corresponds to the plane of the manifest world or to spatial reality: it is thesymbol of the centre, but not in the sense of occupying any situation in spacewhich might imply a sequel. Hence we must conclude that two is the numbercorresponding to the left side and three is that related to the right. Guénonexplains the way in which the cosmic order conforms with all this in a lucidexposition of the relevant Hindu doctrines to the effect that the right hand zone isthe solar region; the left-hand the lunar. ‘In the aspect of this symbolism whichrefers to the temporal condition, the Sun and the right eye correspond to thefuture, the Moon and the left eye to the past; the frontal eye corresponds to thepresent which, from the point of view of the manifested, is but an imperceptiblemoment, comparable to the geometrical point without dimensions in the spatialorder; that is why a single look from the third eye destroys all manifestation(which is expressed symbolically by saying that it reduces everything to ashes),and that is also why it is not represented by any bodily organ; but when one risesabove this contingent point of view, the present is seen to contain all reality (justas the point carries within itself all the possibilities of space), and when succes-sion is transmuted into simultaneity, all things abide in the “eternal present”, sothat the apparent destruction is truly a “transformation” ‘ (26). Now, the sevenaspects that define space have been regarded as the origin of all septenary groups,and in particular of the seven planets, the seven colours and the seven kinds oflandscape (50). Hence Luc Benoist can assert that the Christian Church, bybuilding on earth a mighty, three-dimensional cross of stone, has created for theentire world the co-ordinate lines of a supernatural geometry. Benoist then quotesClement of Alexandria as saying that the six directions of space symbolize—orare equivalent to—the simultaneous and eternal presence of the six days of theCreation, and that the seventh day (of rest) signifies the return to the centre andthe beginning (6). Once the cosmic sense of spatial symbolism has been demon-strated, it is simple to deduce its psychological applications. And once the staticlaws have been determined, it is easy to grasp the dynamic-implications, alwaysbearing in mind the symbolism of orientation. Here, we must point out that theswastika—a solar and polar symbol—implies a movement from right to left, like"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"SPHINX303the apparent movement of the sun; and that Clotho—one of the Parcae—spinsher ‘wheel of destiny’ in the same direction, that is, the opposite way to exist-ence, so destroying it. Right-handedness is characteristic of all symbols of naturallife (28); hence, in the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, to enter is to go towardsthe right and to go out is to go towards the left (19); orienting these hieroglyphs,we have the right corresponding with the rise and the left with the setting of thesun. Similarly, the right side takes on an extra implication of birth and life, whilethe left side acquires an association with death (17). Another consequence, appar-ent in allegories and emblems, is that the right side corresponds to the highervirtues—if one may put it that way—such as compassion, and the left side tojustice. All of the above conclusions are logical deductions drawn from the studyof oriental tradition, supported by the findings of experimental psychology. Butthey are conclusions which have also been verified by anthropologists and soci-ologists in their studies of the habits of diverse peoples. Ania Teillard, for ex-ample, has collated a mass of facts; she quotes J. J. Bachofen as asserting (in hisMutterrecht und Urreligion und Grabersymbolik der Alten) that, in the importantand very common equation ‘right hand=masculinity’, the left hand harboursmagic powers and the right hand the force of reason, and also that in matriarchalsocieties one always finds the idea of superiority attributed to the left side, andconversely. To turn to the left is to look back upon the past, the unconscious,implying introversion; to turn to the right is to look upon the outside world,implying action and extraversion. At the same time, ethnologists are agreed thatduring the first stage of any period of sun-worship, the right side becomes pre-eminent, whereas in lunar cults it is the left side which prevails (56). In paintings,reliefs and other artistic creations of man, the left side is characterized by a morevivid projection of the self (that is, by identification) and the right side is moreextravert.Spark An image of the spiritual principle which gives birth to each indi-vidual, related also to the Cabbalistic (emanatist) concept of souls scattering fromthe centre outwards into the world in the form of sparks (32). For Jung, it istherefore a symbol of the heavenly father.Sparrowhawk Like the eagle, this bird was consecrated to the sun by theEgyptians, the Greeks and Romans, who attributed to it all the powers associatedwith the sun (8).Sphinx A fabulous being composed of several parts of the human being andfour of various animals. The sphinx at Thebes had the head and breasts of awoman, the body of a bull or dog, the claws of a lion, the tail of a dragon and thewings of a bird (8). Being the supreme embodiment of the enigma, the sphinx"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"SPIDER304keeps watch over an ultimate meaning which must remain for ever beyond theunderstanding of man. Jung sees in it a synthesis of the ‘Terrible Mother’, asymbol which has left its mark on mythology as well (31). The mask of thesphinx pertains to the mother-image and also to nature-symbolism; but beneaththe mask lie the implications of the myth of multiplicity or of the enigmaticfragmentation of the cosmos. According to esoteric tradition, the Gizeh sphinx isa synthesis of all the science of the past. It is shown contemplating the rising sunand seems to embrace both heaven and earth in its meaning. It is, of course, asymbol which unites, in the midst of the heterogeneity of existence, the fourElements (corresponding to the tetramorphs) with the quintessence or the spirit(signified by the human part of the figure) (49) (Plate XXV).Spider The spider is a symbol with three distinct meanings; sometimes theymerge or overlap, sometimes one or the other predominates. The three meaningsare derived from: (i) the creative power of the spider, as exemplified in theweaving of its web; (ii) the spider’s aggressiveness; and (iii) the spider’s web as aspiral net converging towards a central point. The spider sitting in its web is asymbol of the centre of the world, and is hence regarded in India as Maya, theeternal weaver of the web of illusion (32). The spider’s destructive powers arealso connected with its significance as a symbol of the world of phenomena. AsSchneider points out, spiders, in their ceaseless weaving and killing—building anddestroying—symbolize the ceaseless alternation of forces on which the stabilityof the universe depends. For this reason, the symbolism of the spider goes deep,signifying, as it does, that ‘continuous sacrifice’ which is the means of man’scontinual transmutation throughout the course of his life. Even death itself merelywinds up the thread of an old life in order to spin a new one (51). The spider is alunar animal because the moon (owing to its passive character, in the sense that itmerely reflects light, and because of its waxing and waning phases, taking these inthe positive and negative sense) is related to the world of phenomena, and, on thepsychic level, to the imagination. Thus the moon, since it holds sway over thewhole phenomenal world (for all phenomenal forms are subject to growth anddeath), weaves the thread of each man’s destiny. Accordingly, the moon is de-picted as a gigantic spider in many myths (17).Spindle or Bobbin The spindle and the distaff, and likewise the act ofsewing, are symbols of life and the temporal; they are therefore related to themoon, a symbol expressing the transitoriness of life or all that goes in phases.Hence, deities incorporating the characteristics of the moon, the earth or vegeta-tion usually have the spindle or the distaff as attributes; this is the case withIshtar, Atargatis, etc. (17). Schneider supports this with his definition of the"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"SPIRAL305spindle as a symbol of the Magna Mater who is sewing with it inside a mountainof stone or on top of the Tree of the World. In shape, the spindle is a mandorla andso acquires the symbolism of two intersecting circles which stand for heaven andearth, that is, of the sacrifice which renews the generating force of the universe.All spindle-shaped symbols signify the broad idea of mutual sacrifice and thepower of inversion (50).Spinning Spinning—like singing—is equivalent to bringing forth and foster-ing life. Hence Schneider’s comment ‘unhappy is the poor spinner who leaves herskeins (that is, her offspring) to dry on the river-bank and finds them gone’ (51).The Parcae, like fairies, are spinners. Likewise, a host of figures of legend andfolklore.Spiral A schematic image of the evolution of the universe. It is also a classicalform symbolizing the orbit of the moon (50), and a symbol for growth, related tothe Golden Number (32), arising (so Housay maintains) out of the concept of therotation of the earth. In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs the spiral—corre-sponding to the Hebrew vau—denotes cosmic forms in motion, or the relation-ship between unity and multiplicity. Of especial importance in relation to thespiral are bonds and serpents. The spiral is essentially macrocosmic (19). Theabove ideas have been expressed in mythic form as follows: ‘From out of theunfathomable deeps there arose a circle shaped in spirals. . . . Coiled up within thespirals, lies a snake, a symbol of wisdom and eternity’ (9). Now, the spiral can befound in three main forms: expanding (as in the nebula), contracting (like thewhirlwind or whirlpool) or ossified (like the snail’s shell). In the first case it is anactive sun-symbol, in the second and third cases it is a negative moon-symbol(17). Nevertheless, most theorists, including Eliade, are agreed that the symbol-ism of the spiral is fairly complex and of doubtful origin. Its relationship withlunar animals and with water has been provisionally admitted (18). Going rightback to the most ancient traditions, we find the distinction being made betweenthe creative spiral (rising in a clockwise direction, and attributed to Pallas Athene)and the destructive spiral like a whirlwind (which twirls round to the left, and isan attribute of Poseidon) (51). As we have seen, the spiral (like the snake orserpent and the Kundalini force of Tantrist doctrine) can also represent the po-tential centre as in the example of the spider’s web. Be that as it may, the spiral iscertainly one of the essential motifs of the symbolism of ornamental art all overthe world, either in the simple form of a curve curling up from a given point, or inthe shape of scrolls, or sigmas, etc. Parkin observes in his Prehistoric Art that ‘noornamental motif seems to have been more attractive than the spiral’. Ortiz (41)suggests that, from a semantic point of view, the spiral is an emblem of atmo-"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"SPIRAL, DOUBLE306spheric phenomena and of the hurricane in particular; but the fact is that thehurricane in its turn is a symbol of secession from the creative (as well as destruc-tive) functions of the universe, that is, of the suspension of the provisional butpacific order of the universe. He also points to the connexion between breathingand the creative breath of life. He goes on to suggest that the volute in ancientcultures was a spiral form symbolizing the breath and the spirit. It is for thisreason that the Egyptian god Thoth is represented with a large spiral on his head.Finally, by virtue of its significance in connexion with creation, with movementand progressive development, the spiral is an attribute of power, found in thesceptre of the Egyptian pharaoh, in the lituus of Roman augurs and in the present-day walking-stick. In addition to the above, it is also possible that the spiral maysymbolize the relationship between the circle and the centre. For the spiral isassociated with the idea of the dance, and especially with primitive dances ofhealing and incantation, when the pattern of movement develops as a spiral curve.Such spiral movements (closely related to the pattern of the mandala and to thespiral form that appears so frequently in art from the Mesolithic Age onwards—particularly in France, Ireland and England) may be regarded as figures intendedto induce a state of ecstasy and to enable man to escape from the material worldand to enter the beyond, through the ‘hole’ symbolized by the mystic Centre.Striking examples of such spirals are those of Gravinias (Morbihan), New Grange(Leinster), Carnwath (Scotland) and Castle Archdall (Ulster).Spiral, Double The double spiral represents the completion of the sigmoidline, and the ability of the sigmoid line to express the intercommunication be-tween two opposing principles is clearly shown in the Chinese Yang-Yin symbol.Two double spirals intersecting form the swastika with curved arms, a motifwhich is fairly common although not so frequent as the arrangement of a series ofdouble spirals in a continuous rhythm. It has been suggested that this motif firstappeared in Danubian culture, whence it spread outwards to the north and southof Europe and across Asia to the Far East. Whereas the architectural meander ofstraight lines and right angles is a symbol of earth, the double spiral is closelylinked with water. Given that water is the Element of transition, transformationand regeneration, the double spiral is capable of fully representing its symbolicsignificance. Hence, it is of common occurrence in the Cretan and other markedlymarine cultures. From a cosmic point of view, the double spiral may be regardedas the flattened projection of the two halves of the egg of the world, or of theprimordial hermaphrodite separated into two halves, or of the Upper and LowerWaters (8). Hence, together with the St. Andrew’s cross, and the drum shaped"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"SQUARING THE CIRCLE307rather like an hour-glass, it constitutes a symbol of Inversion and of the relation-ship between opposites (6, 50).Spur The spur is a symbol of active force. It is attached to the heel like thewings of Mercury, and protects the legendary Achilles’ heel. The spur of gold,together with the belt, symbolized, in the Middle Ages, the ‘defensive’ (or moral)virtues of the knight.Square The square, as the expression of the quaternity, is a symbol of thecombination and regulation of four different elements. Hence, it corresponds tothe symbolism of the number four and to all four-part divisions of any processwhatsoever. Psychologically, its form gives the impression of firmness and stabil-ity, and this explains its frequent use in symbols of organization and construc-tion. For Jung, the four-part division of movements and forms is of greater valuethan the three-part. Whether or not this is so, what is certain is that, as against thedynamism of the odd numbers and their related geometric forms (such as: three,five, the triangle or the pentagon), the even numbers and forms (for example: four,six, eight, the square, the hexagon, the octagon) are characterized by the qualitiesof stability, firmness and definition. Hence, ternary symbolism tends to illustrateactivity and dynamism (or pure spirit), whereas the quaternary alludes predomi-nantly to things material (or the merely rational intellect). The four Elements, thefour seasons, the four stages of Man’s life, and specially the four points of thecompass, are all sources of the order and the stability of the world. This does notcontradict the feminine character which Chinese, Hindu and other traditions as-cribe to the square, since it corresponds to the earth, in contrast to the masculinecharacter of the circle (and the triangle) (32). In Egyptian hieroglyphs the squaresignifies achievement and the square-shaped spiral denotes constructive, materi-alized energy (19). However, the square resting upon one of its corners acquiresa dynamic sense which is quite new, implying a change in its fundamental sym-bolism: during the Romanesque period, it was used as a symbol of the sun,comparable with the circle (51).Squaring the Circle The ancient Mesopotamians used to place a circlebetween two squares in order to find out its area. And the idea of equating thecircle with the square also grew out of the concept of the rotating square. But ourconcern is not with the mathematical but the symbolic problem. ‘Squaring thecircle’, like the lapis or the aurum philosophicum, was one of the preoccupationsof the alchemists; but whereas the latter two were symbols of the quest for theevolutive goal of the spirit, the former problem concerned the equating of the twogreat cosmic symbols of heaven (or the circle) and earth (or the square). It is to do,then, with the union of two opposites; not juxtaposition as in the coniunctio of"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"STAFF308the two arms of the cross, for example, but the equation and cancelling out of twocomponents in a higher synthesis. The square was seen to correspond to the fourElements. The aim of ‘squaring the circle’, then (which strictly ought to be called‘circling the square’), was to obtain unity in the material world (as well as in thespiritual life) over and above the differences and obstacles (the static order) of thenumber four and the four-cornered square. We have already suggested that therotated square was reckoned an important part of this project, and HeinrichKhunrath comments in his Von hylealischen Chaos: ‘By means of circumrotationor circulatory revolution, the quaternary is restored to purest simplicity andinnocence’ (32). Another means of getting an ersatz ‘squaring’ was to superim-pose two squares, inscribing a circle within them, in such a way as to form anoctagon. The octagon can indeed be considered, in both a geometric and a sym-bolic sense, as the intermediary form between the square and the circle. For thisreason it never symbolized the opus itself (that is, the mystic consummation ofthe synthesis of opposites), but it did stand for the path indicated by thingsquaternary (such as the earth, the feminine element, matter or reason) towards thecircle (representing perfection, eternity and spirit). That is why many mediaevalbaptisteries, fonts and cupolas are octagonal in shape.Staff The staff has a double symbolism, as a support and as an instrument ofpunishment. As regards the first, Frazer notes that the ancient Egyptians held afestival after the Autumn Solstice which they called the ‘Nativity of the Sun-Stick’, because they supposed that, as the day grew shorter and the sunlightweaker, the sun needed a stick for support (21). Dalí has revived the mythic staffin the form of crutches, which are a recurrent theme in his paintings. The use ofstaff-symbolism, both among the ancient Egyptians and in a modern artist suchas Dalí, exemplifies an elementary principle of symbolism: the correlation andinterchangeability of the material and spiritual aspects of a given situation. As aweapon it is symbolically identical with the club, the royal weapon (15) (Oedi-pus kills Laius, whom he does not know to be his father, with a blow of his staff).Stag Its symbolic meaning is linked with that of the Tree of Life, because ofthe resemblance of its antlers to branches. It is also a symbol of the cycles ofregeneration and growth, as Henri-Charles Puech has observed. The stag, in sev-eral cultures of Asia and pre-Columbian America, came to be thought of as asymbol of regeneration because of the way its antlers are renewed. Like the eagleand the lion, it is the secular enemy of the serpent, which shows that, symboli-cally, it was viewed favourably; it is closely related to heaven and light, whereasthe serpent is associated with night and subterranean life (18). Hence, in theMilky Way, on both sides of the Bridge of Death and Resurrection are figures of"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"STAR309eagles, stags and horses acting as mediators between heaven and earth (50). In theWest, during the Middle Ages, the way of solitude and purity was often symbol-ized by the stag, which actually appears in some emblems with a crucifix betweenits horns (thus providing the last link in the chain of relationships: tree/cross/horns) (4). It has also been considered as a symbol of elevation (20). The Greeksand Romans perceived certain ‘mystical’ gifts in the stag, which they exaggeratedthrough psychic projection. One of these supposed gifts was the ability instinc-tively to recognize medicinal plants, which is what lies behind the assertion inancient bestiaries that ‘the stag can recognize the dictamnus plant’. His prestigeis in part a consequence of his appearance: his beauty, grace, agility (46). Becauseof his rôle as messenger of the gods, the stag may be considered as the antithesisof the he-goat.Stains The symbolism of blots or stains—like that of the wall-flakingswhich so impressed Piero de Cosimo and Leonardo da Vinci—is a combination ofthe symbolisms pertaining to the shapes of these stains and their texture ormaterial. A related symbol is that of clouds, in so far as both clouds and blotssuggest imaginary shapes which, by analogy, may be identified with other shapes.Proof of this has been afforded by the Rorschach test. These blots or stains areoften associated with the passage of time, in which case they allude to ideas of thetransitory and death. At the same time, stains and areas of discoloration or imper-fection of all kinds may also be explained by reference to the symbolism of theabnormal, for, according to the alchemists, such ‘infirmities’ in objects or materi-als actually constitute ‘prime matter’, the basis for the creation of philosophicalgold (equated with spiritual evolution). As the Rosarium Philosophorum says:‘Our gold is not common gold. You, nevertheless, have asked about the greenassuming that the mineral is a leprous body because of the green which grows init. It is for this reason that I tell you that what is perfect in the mineral is solelythis green, because very soon it will be transformed by our craft into the truestgold.’ Relevant to this is Nietzsche’s remark, in Thus Spake Zarathustra, that‘Out of the lowest the highest reaches its peak’ (32).Star As a light shining in the darkness, the star is a symbol of the spirit.Bayley has pointed out, however, that the star very rarely carries a single mean-ing—it nearly always alludes to multiplicity. In which case it stands for the forcesof the spirit struggling against the forces of darkness. This is a meaning which hasbeen incorporated into emblematic art all over the world (4). For this reason,‘identification with the star’ is possible only to the chosen few. Jung recalls theMithraic saying: ‘I am a star which goes with thee and shines out of the depths’(31). Now, individual stars are often seen in graphic symbolism. Their meaning"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"STARS310frequently depends upon their shape, the number of points, the manner of theirarrangement, and their colour (if any). The ‘flaming star’ is a symbol of the mysticCentre—of the force of the universe in expansion (4). The five-pointed star is themost common. As far back as in the days of Egyptian hieroglyphics it signified‘rising upwards towards the point of origin’, and formed part of such words as‘to bring up’, ‘to educate’, ‘the teacher’, etc. (19). The inverted five-pointed staris a symbol of the infernal as used in black magic (37).Stars Being nocturnal, their symbolism is associated with that of night; theyare also linked with the idea of multiplicity (or with disintegration) because theyappear in clusters, and with order and destiny because of their disposition andlocation (according to Horapollo Niliacus).Stars, The The seventeenth enigma of the Tarot, depicting an allegoricalimage of a naked girl kneeling down beside a pool, as, from a golden jar, she poursa life-giving liquid into the still waters. In her left hand she holds a silver jar fromwhich she pours fresh water on to the dry earth, encouraging the growth of thevegetation—signified most often by a sprig of acacia and a rose in full bloom, anemblem of immortality and of love. Above this figure are a bright star and severallesser ones. The ultimate meaning of this symbol seems to be expressive ofintercommunication of the different worlds, or the vitalization by the celestialluminaries of liquids contained in certain vessels, and implying, furthermore, thetransference of these celestial characteristics to the purely material Elements ofearth and water. For this reason, Oswald Wirth concludes that this enigma repre-sents the soul uniting spirit with matter (59).State of Mind The symbolist idea that the different worlds are so manydifferent states of being (crystallized into different orders of matter and formwith their corresponding, expressive characteristics), and that they can be sys-tematized, in their diversity, within a scale or series, after the manner of theregular figures of geometry, colours or sounds, can equally well be taken the otherway round. In which case, the states of being, which, from the psychological"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"STEEL311point of view, are represented as corresponding emotional states, that is, asvarying ‘states of mind’ (comparable with the emotional expressions peculiar toeach one of the musical modes: severe, ecstatic, anguished, enthusiastic, active,erotic, melancholic)—these states of being, then, come to be represented as cer-tain definite kinds of landscape, in which the additional symbolisms of level, ofsymmetry, of light and colour, all play a definite part.State of Preservation A symbol whose meaning is almost literal, or analo-gous to the physical, by simple transference of the physical characteristics of athing on to the spiritual and psychological plane. So, for example, fracture sym-bolizes fragmentation, disintegration and mutilation on the spiritual level; wearstands for weariness of spirit, poor health and a worn-out sentiment or idea;corrosion for destruction, infirmity and suffering. We have here the age-old con-cept of the parallel between the physical and the psychic worlds, an idea whichgave rise to the alchemists’ postulate that a series of operations upon matter musthave repercussions upon the spirit—and indeed this was true by virtue of theforce of their intention. Nevertheless, one must guard against accepting the abovesymbological interpretation as the only possible one, for it is a very generalizedconclusion; there are, in fact, other symbolic meanings, sometimes, in particularcases, of greater importance than this, deriving from the agent which is bringing itabout. The action of each of the Elements, for instance, always imparts a strongflavour of its own symbolic character. Fire, water or earth, if they burn or soak anobject, or cause it to putrefy, in addition to altering its physical identity andchanging its state also inject into it some part of their own mode of behaviour.Steed A symbol of the animal in man, that is, of the force of the instincts. Asa riding-mount, it is also a symbol of the body. That is why most mythologicalfigures, quite apart from their other attributes, are linked with one particularmount (Wotan mounted on Sleipnir, Ahuramazda on Angramainyu, Mithras onthe bull, Men on a horse with human feet, Freyr on the boar with bristles of gold)(31). The arrangement of the symbol is like that of the centaur, but the hierarchi-cal order is reversed: whereas the centaur stands for the superior force of theinstincts (or even for intuition, a gift attributed by some primitive peoples toanimals in general and to the horse in particular), the steed in itself symbolizescontrol of baser forces. In India, the mount is seen as vahana (materialization).The pedestal plays a similar rôle, its shape always being symbolic. In this way,the goddess Padmâ, for example, is associated with the lotus (60).Steel According to Evola in La tradizione ermetica, steel denotes the tran-scendent toughness of the principle of the all-conquering spirit."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"STEPS312Steps This is a symbol which is very common in iconography all over theworld. It embraces the following essential ideas: ascension, gradation, and com-munication between different, vertical levels. In the Egyptian system ofhieroglyphs, steps constitute a determinative sign which defines the act of as-cending; it forms part of one of the appellations of Osiris, who is invoked as ‘hewho stands at the top of the steps’. Ascending, then, can be understood both ina material and in an evolutive and spiritual sense. Usually, the actual number ofsteps involved in the symbol is of symbolic significance. In Egyptian images, thenumber tends to be nine: the triple ternary which symbolizes the gods of theennead who, together with Osiris, make up the symbolic number ten whichstands for the completed cycle or the return to unity (19). A great many Egyptiantombs have yielded up amulets in the shape of ladders. The Book of the Deadsays: ‘My steps are now in position so that I may see the gods.’ Eliade haspointed out parallel images, such as the following: Among many primitive peoples,mythic ascension is indicated by means of a rope, a stake, a tree or a mountain(symbolizing the world-axis). Or, according to an Oceanian myth, the hero reachesheaven by means of the fantastic hyperbole of a chain of arrows. And in Islamictradition, Mohammed saw a ladder which the just climbed up to reach God (17).To refer again to primitive belief, Schneider observes that in order to ‘reach’ themountain of Mars and reap its benefits, one must ascend the ladder of one’sforebears—suggesting a biological and historical source for the mystic symbol ofthe ladder. Hence steps are also one of the most notable symbols in ancestral rites(50). Images specifically connected with the steps are the mountain, and architec-tural structures incorporating steps, such as the Egyptian pyramid of Sakkara,the Mesopotamian ziggurats, or the teocallis of America of pre-Columbian days;we have then a synthesis of two symbols—that of the ‘temple-mountain’ andthat of the steps—signifying that the entire cosmos is the path of ascensiontowards the spirit. In Mithraism, the ceremonial steps were seven in number,each step being made of a different metal (as was each different plane of theziggurat in a figurative sense). According to Celsus, the first step was of lead(corresponding to Saturn). The general correspondence with the planets is self-evident. Now, this idea of gradual ascent was taken up particularly by the alche-mists from the latter part of the Middle Ages onwards; they identified it some-times with the phases of the transmutation process. In Stephan Michelspacher’swork Die Cabala, Spiegel der Kunst und Natur (1654), the following graded scaleis given: Calcination, Sublimation, Solution, Putrefaction, Distillation, Coagula-tion, Tincture, leading to a kind of shrine inside a mountain (32). According to the"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"STONE313Zohar, the ladder which Jacob is said to have seen in his dreams had seventy-tworungs and its top disappeared into the clouds (39). Broadly speaking, in emblemsand allegories throughout the Middle Ages, it is the ascending (affirmative) aspectof the steps which predominates, emphasized by the signs and symbols cluster-ing round the ladder. Bayley points out that many steps are surmounted by across, the figure of an angel, a star or a fleur-de-lis (4) located on the border itself.In Romanesque art, and generally in the thought characteristic of the period, thesteps are the symbol of the ‘relationship between the worlds’ (14, 20), but itmust not be forgotten that, within the spatial symbolism of level, there are nottwo grades indicating two different worlds (the terrestrial or intermediary and thecelestial or upper) but three (through the addition of a third: the infernal or lowerworld). This is why Eliade (for reasons of psychology as well) states that thesteps are a vivid image of ‘breaking through’ the levels of existence in order toopen up the way from one world to another, establishing a relationship betweenheaven, earth and hell (or between virtue, passivity and sin). Hence, steps locatedbeneath the level of the earth are always a symbol for an opening into the infernalregions. In Bettini’s Libro del monte santo di Dio (Florence, 1477), steps areshown superimposed upon a mountain; to emphasize the parallel—and indeedidentical—symbolism of the mountain and the ladder, the former is portrayed asif it were terraced and the terraces are shown to be the rungs of the ladder. Onthese rungs are the names of the virtues: Humility, Prudence, Temperance, Forti-tude, Justice, Awe, Mercy, Science, Counsel, Understanding and Wisdom. Thesteps are portrayed as if chained to the mountainside. On the peak of the moun-tain is a mandorla formed of angels with Christ in the centre. (Plate XXVI).Stick A material symbol of the valley-mountain axis, comparable with steps,the cross and the artificial stake. The post has the same symbolic sense, largelybecause it stands erect. A burnt stick represents death and wisdom (50).Stone Stone is a symbol of being, of cohesion and harmonious reconciliationwith self. The hardness and durability of stone have always impressed men,suggesting to them the antithesis to biological things subject to the laws of change,decay and death, as well as the antithesis to dust, sand and stone splinters, asaspects of disintegration. The stone when whole symbolized unity and strength;when shattered it signified dismemberment, psychic disintegration, infirmity,death and annihilation. Stones fallen from heaven served to explain the origin oflife. In volcanic eruptions, air turned to fire, fire became ‘water’ and ‘water’changed to stone; hence stone constitutes the first solid form of the creativerhythm (51)—the sculpture of essential movement, and the petrified music of"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"STONE-CIRCLE314creation (50). The mythic and religious significance is only one step removedfrom this basic symbolic sense, a step which was taken by the immense majorityof peoples during the animistic era. Meteorites, in particular, came in for wor-ship; the most celebrated are the Kaaba meteorite in Mecca and the Black Stoneof Pessinus, an aniconic image of the Phrygian Great Mother taken to Romeduring the last of the Punic Wars (17). Here is a description of the Mohammed-ans’ stone, taken from Marques-Rivière: ‘Inside the Kaaba, which is nothingmore than a dark hall, there are three columns holding up the roof which has anumber of silver and gold lamps hanging down from it. The floor is of marble tiles.In the eastern corner, some five feet above floor-level, not far from the door, is thefamous black stone (al hadjar alaswad) sealed off, composed of three greatsections. . . . In colour it is reddish black with red and yellow patches; in appear-ance it recalls lava or basalt’ (39). Among the stones venerated by the ancients, wemust not overlook the Greek omphaloi; Guénon maintains that they are reallybethels, a word derived from the Hebrew Beith-El (or the House of God), relatedto the biblical ‘And this stone which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s House’(Genesis xxviii, 22), even though its sense is magic and not architectonic (28).There are numerous legends dealing with stones: the so-called Abadir whichSaturn devoured, mistaking it for Jupiter; or the stones of Deucalion and Pyrrha;or those in the myth of Medusa the Gorgon (6); or that which contained Mithrasuntil his birth (11). There are other stones in folktales, but these seem to beinvested with rather more modest powers: the Lapis lineus, for example, as it wascalled by the Romans, which was supposed to be able to prophesy by changingits colour; or the Irish stone Lia-Fail, associated with coronations (8). As for thephilosophers’ stone in alchemy, it represents the ‘conjunction’ of opposites, orthe integration of the conscious self with the feminine or unconscious side (or inother words, the fixing of volatile elements); it is, then, a symbol of the All (33).As Jung rightly says, the alchemists approached their task obliquely—they didnot seek the divine in matter but tried to ‘produce’ it by means of a lengthyprocess of purification and transmutation (32). According to Evola, the touch-stone is symbolic of the body, since it is ‘fixed’, as opposed to the ‘wandering’characteristic of thought, the spirits and desires. But only the resuscitated body—in which ‘two will be one’—can correspond to the philosophers’ stone. Evolapoints out that, for the alchemist, ‘between eternal birth, reintegration, and thediscovery of the philosophers’ stone, there is no difference whatsoever’.Stone-Circle Often called a ‘cromlech’, and popularly known as ‘the giant’scircle’. Diodorus Siculus had in mind the great stone-circle of Stonehenge when he"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"STRENGTH315referred to the existence, on an island off Gaul ‘as big as Sicily’, of ‘the circulartemple of Apollo’ where the Hyperboreans sang the praises of god-the-sun. Thesun-symbolism connected with the stone-circle is obvious (16). It also partakesof circle-symbolism (that is, of the cyclic process, Oneness and perfection), ofdisk-symbolism (representing the sun), and of stone-symbolism (or, in the eyesof most primitive peoples, theophany—a manifestation of the divine which theyassociated with fertility-cults). Often standing in the midst of the circle of mono-liths is the ‘hyrmensul’ or sun-stone.Stork This bird, dedicated to Juno by the Romans, was a symbol of filialpiety. It is also an emblem of the traveller (8). In the allegory of ‘Great Wisdom’,two storks are shown facing each other and flying within a circle formed by thefigure of a snake (4).Storm The myth of the creative storm (or creative intercourse between theElements) is universal: among the Nordic peoples it appears in connexion withThor, in Assyrio-Babylonian mythology with Bel, in the Germanic with Donar,in the Greek with Zeus, among the Slavs with Peroun, and so on (38). The storm,like everything else that occurs in heaven or descends therefrom, has a sacredquality about it.Stranger In myths, legends, folktales and in literature as a whole, the ‘stranger’is frequently ‘the one destined to replace’ the reigning power in a country orlocality. He stands for the possibility of unseen change, for the future madepresent, or for mutation in general. Frazer tells us how Lityerses, a son of KingMidas, was wont to challenge people to a reaping match, and if he vanquishedthem he used to thrash them; but one day he met with a stranger who, provinghimself to be a stronger reaper, slew him (21).Strength The eleventh enigma of the Tarot pack. The image shows a queenwho, without apparent effort, overcomes a lion, holding his jaws wide open. Theallusion to the Zodiac is clear enough—Leo vanquished by Virgo—and the sub-ject finds its mythological counterpart in Hercules overcome by Omphale. Wirthpoints to a highly interesting detail in the allegory: the queen does not slay thelion, but clasps it to her bosom having stunned it with her club, signifying that onemust not despise the inferior, but master it and put it to good use. There is an echohere of the alchemists’ belief that what is base must not—and indeed cannot—bedestroyed, it must be transmuted into what is superior. In the affirmative sense,this enigma symbolizes the triumph of intelligence over brutality; in the negative,it denotes insensibility and fury (59)."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"STRING316String (or Cord) All types of string, cord or rope are forms of binding, andthis forms the basis of their symbolic meaning. It is what lies behind the sacredcord worn by all high-caste Hindus. The Jâbâla-Upanishad makes it clear thatthe sacred cord is the external symbol of the Sûtrâtma, or the spiritual threadbinding together all things in existence, as the thread of a necklace binds togetherall the pearls (60). This is an idea of such clarity that expressions of it are to befound everywhere. The cords worn by soldiers and by officials, sashes and bows,braid and stripes, are all nothing but emblems of cohesion and binding, although ina form referring to a particular social status. In our view, this and no other is thesignificance of the neck-tie, despite the Freudian tendency to interpret it as aphallic symbol.Struggles between Animals Animals symbolize different stages of instinctand can therefore be placed along an ideal vertical axis (for example, in ascendingorder: bear, lion, eagle). Accordingly, a struggle between different animals—be-tween a lion and a griffin, a serpent and an eagle, an eagle and a lion, etc.—represents the struggle between widely-differing instinctive inclinations. Thevictory of a winged animal over a wingless one is always a positive symbol,comparable to sublimation. The struggle of an eagle with a lion involves a vectorof lesser intensity than that between an eagle and a serpent, because the distanceseparating the latter pair is greater. The struggle between real and fabulous ani-mals may represent the conflict between realistic instincts or tendencies andfanciful or misleading ones. But this must be decided by the context, for it mayalso represent a reduction in the power of the imagination (that is, in the creativefantasy), to the benefit of material, direct and realistic activity.Styx, The A subterranean spring or lake in Greek mythology—correspond-ing to the underground sea in Egyptian belief—which the sun crosses every night.By analogy, therefore, the lower waters of the Styx pertain to death, just as everysunrise points to resurrection (8).Subterranean Chambers Symbolic of the body’s inside, the viscera.

Inthe complex symbolism of alchemy, sulphur represents one of the stages of theevolution of matter (and of the psyche). According to René Alleau, the variousstages, from the lowest to the highest, can be classified as follows: prior elements,denoting the inherent possibilities of the cosmos, or of man; prime matter, or theelementary organization of inherent possibilities, equivalent perhaps to the un-"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"SUN317conscious, or the instincts; mercury, or the first purification, feelings, imagina-tion, the dominant female principle; sulphur, or more profound purification,reason and intuition, the male principle; and the Great Work, or transcendence.Sun In theogony, the Sun represents the moment (surpassing all others in thesuccession of celestial dynasties) when the heroic principle shines at its brightest.Thus, after Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter, comes Helios Apollo. On occasion, theSun appears as the direct son and heir of the god of heaven, and Krappe notes thathe inherits one of the most notable and moral of the attributes of this deity: hesees all and, in consequence, knows all. In India, as Sûrya, it is the eye of Varuna;in Persia, it is the eye of Ahuramazda; in Greece, as Helios, the eye of Zeus (or ofUranus); in Egypt it is the eye of Ra, and in Islam, of Allah (35). With his‘youthful’ and filial characteristic, the Sun is associated with the hero, as opposedto the father, who connotes the heavens, although the two (sun and sky) aresometimes equated. Hence, the weapon of heaven is the net (the pattern of thestars) or the power of binding; while the hero is armed with the sword (symboli-cally associated with fire). And it is for this reason that heroes are promoted tosolar eminence and even identified with the Sun itself. In a given period of historyand at a certain cultural level, the solar cult is the predominant if not the only one.Frazer, however, as Eliade has noted, brought out the divergencies of the solarelements in the sacred rites of Africa, of Australia and Oceania as a whole, and ofNorth and South America. The cult of the Sun reached an advanced stage ofdevelopment only in the New World, and—most advanced of all—in Mexico andPeru. Eliade concludes that, since these were the only countries in pre-ColumbianAmerica to evolve a viable political system, it may be concluded that there is aparallel between predominantly solar cults and ‘historical’ forms of human exist-ence. We must not overlook the fact that Rome, the most powerful political forceof Antiquity, and the originator of the historical sense, upheld solar hierophany,which, during the Empire, dominated all other cults in the form of Mithraic ritual(17). An heroic and courageous force, creative and guiding—this is the core ofsolar symbolism; it may actually come to constitute a religion complete in itself,as is shown by the ‘heresy’ of Ikhnaton in the 18th dynasty of Egypt; here thehymns to the sun are, setting aside their profound lyrical interest, expressions oftheories about the beneficent activity of the king of astral bodies. The sun on thehorizon had long served the Egyptians of the Ancient Empire as a means ofdefining ‘brightness’ or ‘splendour’. They were also forcibly struck by the anal-ogy between the daily disappearance of the Sun and the winter solstice (19). At"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"SUN318same time, there was, for the primitive, astrobiological mind, an essential connexionbetween the Sun and Moon, analogous to that between heaven and earth. It is wellknown that, for the vast majority of peoples, the sky is symbolic of the activeprinciple (related to the masculine sex and to the spirit), while the earth symbol-izes the passive principle (cognate with the feminine sex and with matter); theseequations, nevertheless, are occasionally transposed. And the same thing hap-pens with the Sun and Moon: solar ‘passion’, so to speak, with its heroic andfierce character, clearly had to be assimilated to the masculine principle, and thepale and delicate nature of lunar light, with its connexion with the waters of theThe Sun and the Moon, symbols of the active and the passive principles of theuniverse as ‘Intellectus angelicus’ and ‘Humanus intellectus’ respectively.(Engraving from Bovillus, De Intellectu, Paris, 1510.)"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"SUN319ocean (and the rhythm of woman), obviously had to be classified as feminine.These equations are certainly not constant; but the exceptions do not invalidatethe essential truth of this symbolism. Even physically speaking, the Moon merelyfulfils the passive rôle of reflecting the light which the Sun actively diffuses.Many primitive tribes hold that the eyes of heaven are the Sun and the Moonlocated on either side of the ‘world-axis’, and there are prehistoric drawings andengravings which may be interpreted after this fashion. Eliade notes that, for thePigmies and Bushmen, the sun is the eye of the supreme god. The Samoyeds seethe Sun and the Moon as the eyes of heaven, the Sun being the good eye, and theMoon the evil eye (one can see here an unequivocal instance of the symbolism ofdualism expanded by the assimilation of that of moral polarity). The idea of theinvincible character of the sun is reinforced by the belief that whereas the Moonmust suffer fragmentation (since it wanes) before it can reach its monthly stage ofthree-day disappearance, the Sun does not need to die in order to descend intohell; it can reach the ocean or the lake of the Lower Waters and cross it withoutbeing dissolved. Hence, the death of the Sun necessarily implies the idea ofresurrection and actually comes to be regarded as a death which is not a true death.For this reason, too, ancestor-worship is associated with the cult of the sun, inorder to offer the symbolic promise of protection and salvation. Megalithic monu-ments are based upon the amalgamation of these two cults (17). Thus, the broad-est and most authentic interpretation sees the sun as the cosmic reductio of themasculine force, and the Moon of the feminine (49). This implies that the activefaculties (of reflexion, good judgement or will power) are solar, while the passivequalities (imagination, sentiment and perception) are feminine, with intuitionpossibly androgynous (26). The ‘correspondences’ of the Sun are chiefly gold,among the metals, and, of the colours, yellow.Alchemists regarded it as ‘gold prepared for the work’ or ‘philosophicalsulphur’, as opposed to the Moon and mercury (the metal), which is lunar (57).Another alchemic concept, that of the Sol in homine (or the invisible essence ofthe celestial Sun which nourishes the inborn fire of Man) (57), is an early pointerto the way the astral body has latterly been interpreted by psychoanalysts,narrowing its meaning down to that of heat or energy, equivalent to the fire of lifeand the libido. Hence Jung’s point that the Sun is, in truth, a symbol of the sourceof life and of the ultimate wholeness of man (32). But here there is probably someinexactitude, for totality is in fact uniquely symbolized by the ‘conjunction’ ofthe Sun and the Moon, as king and queen, brother and sister (32). In somefolklore-traditions, the urge to allude in some way to the supreme good, which,"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"SUN, THE320by definition, is incapable of definition, is met by the saying ‘to join the Sun andthe Moon’.Now, having established the principal terms of solar symbolism—as an he-roic image (Sol invictus, Sol salutis, Sol iustitiae) (14), as the divine eye, the activeprinciple and the source of life and energy—let us come back to the dualism of theSun as regards its hidden passage—its ‘Night Sea-Crossing’—symbolic of imma-nence (like the colour black) and also of sin, occultation and expiation. In theRigveda—Eliade reminds us—the Sun is ambivalent: on the one hand it is ‘re-splendent’ and on the other it is ‘black’ or invisible, in which case it is associatedwith chthonian and funereal animals such as the horse and the serpent (17).Alchemists took up this image of the Sol niger to symbolize ‘prime matter’, orthe unconscious in its base, ‘unworked’ state. In other words, the Sun is then atthe nadir, in the depths out of which it must, slowly and painfully, ascendtowards its zenith. This inevitable ascent does not relate to its daily journey,although this is used as an image, and hence it is symbolized by the transmutationof prime matter into gold, passing through the white and red stages, like the Sunitself in its orbit. Of undoubted interest, as an indication of the intensity of man’sattitude towards the Sun, is the reference by Tacitus and Strabo to the ‘sound’made by the Sun as it rises in the East and drowns in the oceans of the West. Thesudden disappearance of the Sun below the horizon is related to the sudden deathof heroes such as Samson, Hercules and Siegfried (35).Sun, The The nineteenth enigma of the Tarot pack. The allegory shows thedisk of the astral king surrounded by alternating straight and flamelike rays,golden and red, symbolizing the twofold activity of the Sun in giving out warmthand light. Beneath the Sun, from which a golden spray is falling, are a youngcouple in a green field, and in the background there is a wall. This couple symbol-ize the Gemini under the beneficial influence of spiritual light. The Sun is theastral body of immutable constancy, and hence it reveals the reality of things—not their changing aspects as the Moon does. It is related to purification andtribulation, the sole purpose of which is to render transparent the opaque crust ofthe senses so that they may perceive the higher truths. But the Sun, apart fromproviding light and heat, is the source of supreme riches, and this is symbolized,in the allegory, by the golden drops which, as in the myth of Danae, rain downupon the human couple. On the positive side, this enigma symbolizes glory,spirituality and illumination. On the negative side, it stands for vanity or anidealism incompatible with reality (59)."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"SUPPORTERS321Sun-shade A solar symbol, an emblem of authority and dignity, and one ofthe eight allegories of good fortune in Chinese Buddhism (5). It incorporates thesymbolic concepts of irradiation and protection.Superiority In certain Babylonian rites, the hieros gamos was representedby an act of erotic consummation between a priestess of Ishtar and a slave, whowas afterwards put to death. This was not an act of cruelty, but the inevitableconsequence which attended the act of the slave, as the shadow pursues the body.For if he had been left alive, the remainder of his existence would have been aliving death, since he had experienced contact with the Superior. The same may besaid of Lazarus; and this is the meaning of the myth of Semele, consumed by thefiery radiance of Jupiter whom she sought to see in all his true and essential glory.The superior destroys—burns up—the inferior. But, for this very reason, therecipient of any such token of the supra-normal who is not destroyed by the giftbut proves himself capable of retaining it, establishes thereby his own (compa-rable) superiority. Hence, anything of value surpassing the ordinary and thecommonplace is a sign of special favour and a symbol of absolute transcendence.He who dares to desire the superior, thereby invites comparison with it; if hesucceeds in entering into the domain of this superiority and withstands it, then heis invested with it, but should he prove unworthy then he must needs be de-stroyed. Every limiting situation, every extreme trial—such as placing one’s handin boiling water, for instance—denotes this same idea. The knight conquered anddevoured by the dragon is thereby proved inferior. Only the knight capable ofvanquishing the dragon is worthy to confront it. Aspiring to the hand of the‘princess’ is another expression of the same idea.

Thepoet Bécquer makes use of this symbol to convey the pathos and the inexorablenature of time, drawing analogies with other symbols.Swan A symbol of great complexity. The dedication of the swan to Apollo,as the god of music, arose out of the mythic belief that it would sing sweetly whenon the point of death (8). The red swan is a symbol of the sun (2). But almost allmeanings are concerned with the white swan, sacred to Venus, which is whyBachelard suggests that in poetry and literature it is an image of naked woman, ofchaste nudity and immaculate whiteness. But Bachelard finds an even deepersignificance: hermaphroditism, since in its movement and certainly in its longphallic neck it is masculine yet in its rounded, silky body it is feminine. In sum,then, the swan always points to the complete satisfaction of a desire, the swan-song being a particular allusion to desire which brings about its own death (2).This ambivalent significance of the swan was also well known to the alchemists,who compared it with ‘philosophical Mercury’ (57), the mystic Centre and theunion of opposites, an interpretation entirely in accord with its archetypal impli-cations (56). Now, in Schneider’s view, the swan, by virtue of its relationshipwith the harp and the sacrificial serpent, also pertains to the funeral-pyre, be-cause the essential symbols of the mystic journey to the other world (apart fromthe death-ship) are the swan and the harp. This would afford another explanationof the mysterious song of the dying swan. The swan also has a bearing upon thepeacock, although the situation is reversed. The swan/harp relationship, corre-sponding to the axis water/fire, denotes melancholy and passion, self-sacrifice,and the way of tragic art and martyrdom. Conversely the peacock/lute relation-ship, linked with earth/air, is possibly a representation of logical thought (50). AsJacques de Morgan has shown in L’Humanité préhistorique, if it was the horsethat pulled the Sun-god’s chariot by day, it was the swan that hauled his bark overthe waters by night. The relevance to this myth of the Lohengrin legend is self-evident.Swastika This graphic symbol is to be found in almost every ancient andprimitive cult all over the world—in Christian catacombs, in Britain, Ireland,Mycenae and Gascony; among the Etruscans, the Hindus, the Celts and theGermanic peoples; in central Asia as well as in pre-Columbian America. Theimplications of the swastika are very wide, for it is a synthesis of two symbols ofindependent force: the (Greek) cross with arms of equal length and the cross with"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"SWORD323four arms appearing to rotate in the same direction. The tetraskelion, or swastikawith four arms at right angles, is also called the gammadion because it can beformed by joining up four gamma letters. According to Ludwig Müller, the swas-tika, during the Iron Age, represented the supreme deity (39). For Mackenzie, itis associated with agriculture and with the points of the compass. Colley Marchsees the swastika as a specific sign denoting rotation about an axis. There are infact two swastikas: the right-handed Swastika and the left-handed Swavastika(41). The shape of the swastika has been interpreted as a solar wheel with raysand feet sketched in at the extremities (56). By the Middle Ages, the most generalinterpretation was that it symbolized movement and the power of the sun (14);but, at the same time, it was seen as an obvious symbol of the quaternary, in theparticular sense of the ‘configuration of a movement split up into four parts’,related to the poles and the four cardinal directions (16). The latter view is oneheld by René Guénon, for whom the swastika is the ‘sign of the pole’. Since it iswidely accepted that the pole and the zenith coincide with the mystic Centre, itfollows, then, that the swastika would signify the action of the Origin upon theuniverse (25). Schneider has suggested a very different meaning: that the swastikais the symbol of the succession of the generations, and that the hooks on the endsof its arms are the ships of life, or, put another way, the different stages of life(51).Sword The sword is in essence composed of a blade and a guard; it istherefore a symbol of ‘conjunction’, especially when, in the Middle Ages, it takeson the form of a cross. Among many primitive peoples it was the object of muchveneration. The Scythians used to make an annual sacrifice of several horses tothe blade of a sword, which they conceived as a god of war. Similarly, the Romansbelieved that iron, because of its association with Mars, was capable of wardingoff evil spirits (8). The belief still persists in Scotland (21). Founders of cities, inthe ancient Che-King tales of China, wear swords (7). As a religious symbol, it isstill in use as part of the ceremonial dress of oriental bishops. Its primary sym-bolic meaning, however, is of a wound and the power to wound, and hence ofliberty and strength. Schneider has shown that, in megalithic culture, the sword isthe counterpart of the distaff, which is the feminine symbol of the continuity oflife. The sword and the distaff symbolize, respectively, death and fertility—thetwo opposites which constitute the basic symbolism of the mountain (Schneidersuggests that in the animal world the equivalents are the phallic fish and the frog)(50). Furthermore, given the cosmic sense of sacrifice (that is, the inversion of theimplied realities of the terrestrial and the celestial orders), the sword is then seenas a symbol of physical extermination and psychic decision (60), as well as of the"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"SWORD324spirit and the word of God, the latter being a particularly common symbol duringthe Middle Ages (4). In this connexion, Bayley draws attention to the interestingrelationship between the English words sword and word. There can be no doubtthat there is a sociological factor in sword-symbolism, since the sword is aninstrument proper to the knight, who is the defender of the forces of light againstthe forces of darkness. But the fact is that in rites at the dawning of history andin folklore even today, the sword plays a similar spiritual rôle, with the magicpower to fight off the dark powers personified in the ‘malevolent dead’, which iswhy it always figures in apotropaic dances. When it appears in association withfire and flames—which correspond to it in shape and resplendence—it symbol-izes purification. Schneider bears this out with his comment that whereas purifi-cation goes with fire and the sword, punishment goes with the lash and the club(51). In alchemy, the sword is a symbol for purifying fire. The golden sword—Chrysaor in Greek mythology—is a symbol for supreme spiritualization (15).The Western type of sword, with its straight blade, is, by virtue of its shape, asolar and masculine symbol. The Oriental sword, being curved, is lunar andfeminine. Here one must recall the general meaning of weapons, which is theantithesis of the monster. The sword, because of its implication of ‘physicalextermination’, must be a symbol of spiritual evolution, just as the tree is ofinvolution; that is, the tree stands for the development of life within matter andactivity. This dualism between the spirit on the one hand and life on the other wasresolved by Ludwig Klages, for his part, by opting for life, but Novalis has wellexpressed the contrary opinion with his observation that ‘life is an infirmity ofthe spirit’. It is a duality which is well illustrated by the opposing characteristicsof wood (which is feminine) and metal. If the tree corresponds to the process ofproliferation, then the sword represents the inverse. At least Conrad Dinckmut’sSeelen Wurzgarten (Ulm, 1483), like many other similar works, has a 15th-century illustration of Christ with a branch or a tree on the left side of his face,whereas symmetrically opposite there is a sword. This association of the swordwith the tree is of great antiquity: we ourselves have seen a prehistoric Germanicrelief depicting two figures, one being feminine and bearing a branch, the othermasculine, with a sword. One may also see here an allegory of War and Peace;certainly the mediaeval illustration may allude to the olive branch, but there isnothing of this in the Germanic relief. Evola maintains that the sword is related toMars, but with additional vertical—and horizontal—symbolisms, alluding, thatis, to life and death. It is also linked with steel as a symbol of the transcendenttoughness of the all-conquering spirit. To quote from Emilio Sobejano, Swords ofSpain, in Arte Español, XXI (1956): ‘Among the Germanic races, as Livy ob-"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM, PHONETIC325served, the sword was at no time very common; on the contrary, it served as asymbol befitting high command and the loftiest rank; one only has to think of thedignity and pomp which characterized the institution of the Comes Spatharius,created by the Emperor Gordian the Younger around the year 247. . . . The swordis almost exclusively the prerogative of high dignitaries. There is an Arabic tradi-tion to the effect that it was the Hebrews who invented the sword, and that theplace where it was first made—a tragic sign of how the idea first came into theworld—was mount Casium, on the outskirts of Damascus, which was to becomefamous throughout Islam on account of its steel, and where, according to theancient belief, Cain slew his brother. There, by an accident of fate, settled the firstartificers of the newly invented weapon.’ The sword of fire bears testimony tothe intrinsic relationship between the symbols of the sword, steel (or iron), Marsand fire, all of which have a ‘common rhythm’. On the other hand, it emphasizesthe heat of the flame and the coldness of the bare metal; hence, the sword of fireis a symbol implying an ambivalent synthesis, like the volcano (gelat et ardet),and also a symbol of the weapon which severs Paradise (the realm of the fire oflove) from earth (the world of affliction).Sword, Broken Because the sword symbolizes spiritual aggression or ahero’s courage, the broken sword is a symbol of those qualities being in a state ofdestruction. Nevertheless, like the ‘buried sword’, it is more likely to appear inmediaeval legends as an inheritance which has to be reconquered by personalvalour. Thus, as a youth, Siegfried discovers the pieces of the sword Balmunga,which Odin was said to have given to his father Siegmund. Mime, the blacksmith,was unable to reforge it, but Siegfried succeeds in doing so. In the epic entitled‘Gawain-poems’ in the Arthurian cycle (Jean Marx, Nouvelles Recherches sur lalittérature Arthurienne, Paris, 1965), Gawain is given a broken sword which he isunable to repair completely, symbolizing his inability to penetrate to the ‘centre’of his undertaking.Sybil A figure of antiquity, which reappears in mediaeval literature andiconography, symbolizing the intuiting of higher truths and prophetic powers.Symbolism, Phonetic When, about 1870, Rimbaud wrote his famous son-net on the vowels, assimilating each one to a colour, he doubtless yielded to apresentiment rather than to a true intuition and formulated a possibility ratherthan a certitude: A (black), E (white), I (red), U (green), O (blue). The idea ofplacing vowels into correspondence with colours is essential to the penetration ofthe symbolism of phonemes (syllables), but the identifications proposed byRimbaud do not appear correct to us. Also, as the critics have pointed out, hedefines, for example, the U by a line in which the I predominates. But there is"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM, PHONETIC326another feat in the sonnet in question, and that is its boldness in altering theapparently sacred order of the vowels: A, E, I, O, U.Anybody who has penetrated the world of symbolism will, know that thetheory of ‘correspondences’ is one of its corner-stones. This theory postulatesthat one phenomenon alone takes place and that its appearances are resonances ofthe same thing on different planes of reality (sounds, colours, letters, planets inthe solar system, mythological gods, prime metals, etc.). In Marius Schneider’sbooks—especially in El origen musical de los animales-símbolos en la mitologíay escultura antiguas, as the very title indicates—he based his entire symbolicsystem on sounds. He proposes correspondences which may appear strange,arbitrary and fantastic to one who has not delved deeply into the analyses of thiseminent ethnologist, professor at Cologne University and student in situ of Afri-can symbolic thought. He goes so far as to identify musical intervals with typesof landscape (a major fifth = fountain, pool, marsh, etc.). He suggests a symbol-ism of the vowels which seems correct. In general, he classifies them in twogroups: A, O (affirmative vowels) and U, I (negative, dissolvent vowels). The Ewould seem to occupy an intermediate position. Taking into account the fact thatthe scales of many systems have seven elements (for example, the directions ofspace, the days of the week, the planetary gods, the colours, the notes of thediatonic scale, etc.), one must form a group of seven vowels (which, indeed, doexist in many languages) in order to establish exact correspondences. But beforeindicating what these relationships might be, let us transcribe the definition of theterm ‘symbolic correspondence’ as found in Schneider’s work. For him, ‘suchcorrespondences are based on the idea of the indissoluble unity of the universe inwhich each phenomenon has its own particular cosmic position and receives itsmystical meaning through the plane which it occupies in the world and throughthe analogous relationship which it maintains with a specific “corresponding”element, which may be a heavenly body, a colour, a substance, an element ofnature, an animal, a part of the human body, an era in human life, etc.’ Accordingto Schneider, this symbolist philosophy flourished during the Megalithic periodand then spread throughout most of the world, even including Indonesia. It ap-pears that in many languages which do not belong to the same ‘family’, there arestill to be found phonemes which have exactly the same or a similar meaning, andwhich must be derived from the language-universal concept of both that periodand the one immediately preceding it. Gustav Zollinger, in Tau oder Tau-t-an,explains this point and makes some interesting connexions. Working from theopposite side, that of the symbolism of letters as signs, Alfred Kallir, in Sign andDesign, also reaches similar conclusions."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM, PHONETIC327If we arranged a series of seven vowels according to the logic of symbolism,we would have the scale: A, O, OE, E, I, Ü, and U, which corresponds perfectlyto the series of colours: Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet; and tothe diatonic scale of C minor: C, D, E flat, F, G, A flat, B. The reason why thisscale has to be minor and not major is that in this way the distances between theintervals correspond better to the ‘distances’ separating the colours and the sounds.The meaning of each vowel is easy to find in accordance with the meaning of thecorresponding colour and musical sound. From the very start, we may see theperfect correspondence between the warm colours (red, orange and yellow) andthe affirmative sounds (A, O, and OE, or AE), while the correspondence of the E,as the intermediate sound between the affirmative and the dissolutive groups,with green, the transitional tone between the warm and cold colours, is unques-tionable.The organization of consonants within a similar system is difficult. Apartfrom the lucubrations of the Cabbala, and the definitions of the symbolism ofletters to be found within it, it is extremely difficult to find other sources fromwhich to derive such a system. But there are a few facts which have been provedas certain: for example, Schneider and other authors of treatises on symbolismpoint out the opposition between the M and the N (fecundating, maternal waters,and the dissolvent waters of the Nothingness), the contrast between the F and theT (affirmation and sacrifice), and between the B and the Z (body or house andlightning). This last contrast appears in the sixteenth enigma of the Tarot (TheTower Struck by Lightning). Thus, it may be seen that, if one eliminates from theconsonants all those which repeat sounds, and arranges them in two scales (eachone of them is the middle of the whole series inverted), one meets these corre-spondences of opposites face to face. Thus the first half is: B, D, F, G, K, L, M,and the second half: N, P, R, S, T, X, Z, each scale consisting of seven consonants,which give the following symbolic oppositions: B-Z, D-X, F-T, G-S, K-R, L-P,and M-N. Provisionally, as the symbolism of the letter as a sign has already beenstudied (by Kallir and other authors), this knowledge should be applied and then,when one knows the symbolism of one consonant, one knows that of its oppo-site number (its antithesis). Then, one only has to confirm this symbolism by thesound impression in order to attribute it to the letter as a phoneme. Once thesymbolism of the vowels and consonants has been established, they can beplaced in relation in order to analyse the meaning of different syllables or words.The consonants to be omitted are the following: W ( = U), Y ( = I), J ( = G), Q( = K) and H."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"SYMMETRY328All this may seem superficial, artificial, or, worse still, useless. But nothing ininvestigation is useless, and even the most superficial is important in a field whichno one has explored in detail as yet. We only wish that this type of linguistic andliterary analysis might have the necessary repercussion so that one day we mayestablish a basis of authentic phonetic symbolism—in which many linguistsbelieve, but without passing judgement on the substance.Symmetry This is equivalent to achievement, crowning triumph and su-preme equipoise (as in the caduceus, the reliefs of Naksh-i-rustam, and in heraldicshields).TTarot Pack, The Present-day psychology has confirmed the conclusions ofEliphas Lévi, Marc Haven and Oswald Wirth that the Tarot cards comprise animage (comparable to that encountered in dreams) of the path of initiation (56).At the same time, Jung’s view, coinciding with the secular, intuitive approach tothe Tarot enigmas, recognizes the portrayal of two different, but complementary,struggles in the life of man: (a) the struggle against others (the solar way) whichhe pursues through his social position and calling; and (b) against himself (thelunar way), involving the process of individuation. These two ways correspondto reflexion and intuition—to practical reason and pure reason. A person of lunartemperament first creates, then studies and verifies what he already knew; theman of solar temperament studies first and then produces. These two approachesalso correspond, up to a point, to the concepts of introversion (which is lunar)and extraversion (which is solar)—or to contemplation and action (34). Thecomplete pack of cards, known by the name of Tarocco, is made up of 22 majorenigmas, with images that together comprise a synthesis and, up to a point, anentity; and 56 minor images, incorporating 14 figures in four series: gold—corre-sponding to the English ‘diamonds’—bearing figures of circles, disks and wheels;clubs (maces and sceptres); swords (‘spades’) and goblets (‘hearts’). The goldsuit symbolizes the material forces, the club the power of command, the gobletsacrifice, and the sword, discernment and the meting out of justice. The 22 majorcards correspond to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Included in each of the"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"TAROT PACK, THE329suits of the minor cards are the King, the Dame (Queen), the Knight (Horse) andthe Knave (Jack) (48). These suits have been equated with the powers that reignon earth and, in consequence, with the controlling or higher professions, as fol-lows: government with clubs; the military career with spades (swords); the priest-hood with goblets; intellectual activity with gold—for all forms of treasure arealways symbolic of the riches of the spirit and the mind (54). According toSaunier, the images of the major enigmas derive from the symbolic paintings in theEgyptian Books of Thoth-Hermes, representing the knowledge of the universe(49). However, Oswald Wirth, whose interpretations of the symbolism of theTarot we shall, in the main, follow, points out that archaeology has never un-earthed the least trace of anything that might conceivably be an Egyptian, Arabicor Graeco-Arabic Tarot pack. But he indicates that the Cabala must have beenwell known to the authors of the Tarot, because they fixed the number of majorenigmas at 22, which is the same as the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet,every one of them pregnant with symbolism, and the same, also, as the number ofthe teraphim, the hieroglyphs used by the Hebrews in divination. Wirth, arguingfrom the fact that Italy was undeniably the first country to develop playing-cards, maintains that these allegorical images grew up in that country. The earliestrepresentation known to us of the major enigmas dates from 1392. To quoteEliphas Lévi: ‘The Tarot is a monumental and singular work, simple and strong asthe architecture of the pyramids, and, in consequence, as durable; it is a bookwhich is the sum of all the sciences and whose infinite permutations are capableof solving all problems; a book which informs by making one think; it is perhapsthe greatest masterpiece of the human mind, and certainly one of the most beau-tiful things handed down by Antiquity.’ The 22 mysteries are: I, The Minstrel; II,The Archpriestess; III, The Empress; IV, The Emperor; V, The Archpriest; VI,The Lover; VII, The Chariot; VIII, Justice; IX, The Hermit; X, The Wheel ofFortune; XI, Strength; XII, The Hanged Man; XIII, Death; XIV, Temperance; XV,The Devil; XVI, The Tower Struck by Lightning; XVII, The Stars; XVIII, TheMoon; XIX, The Sun; XX, The Judgement; XXI, The World; XXII or 0, TheFool. The cards from I to XI comprise the solar way—active, conscious, reflec-tive and autonomous. Cards XII to XXII denote the lunar way—passive, uncon-scious, intuitive and ‘possessed’. We cannot here explain the relationships whichcan be drawn, or the patterns of meanings which can be derived from theserelationships, without going beyond the bounds of strict symbolism; an examina-tion of the particular meaning of each card will be found under its appropriateheading.

Each of these images comprisesa fusion of certain ideas relative to the outer and inner worlds, disposed accordingto the forms and patterns of the mind. The intention is to create, by means ofthese images, an order more comprehensive even than that comprising the twelvedivisions of the Zodiac, and to design a wheel which would embody all thearchetypal potentialities of the existence and evolution of mankind.Our aim has been simply to sketch in an idea of how the Tarot pack functionsas a symbolic instrument. In order to grasp the full range of its significance, it isnecessary to study not only the basic commentaries written upon it but also thecards themselves, observing all the combinations and implications—a field sovast as to constitute a special branch of symbolism as wide-ranging as that ofdreams.Tattooing Tattooing and ornamentation may be regarded as falling within onegeneric symbolic group, for both are expressions of cosmic activity. But sincetattoos are applied to the body, other important meanings accrue to it—sacrifice,the mystical and magical. E. Gobert, in Notes sur les tatouages des indigènesTunisiens, suggests that tattooing is connected with the Arabic proverb ‘bloodhas flowed, the danger has passed’. Since sacrifice has the power to store uplatent forces which later may be made use of, each sacrifice tends to invert a givensituation. A mystic purpose lies at the root of the mark or sign of identification:he who brands himself seeks to display his allegiance to that which is signified bythe mark. (Lovers’ marks carved on tree-trunks, and initials and heart-shapespricked out on the skin, are clear illustrations of this.) In the last analysis, theattitude of allegiance is reversed: the sign is expected to ‘reciprocate’ this display"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"TAURUS331of sacrifice and subservience on the part of the individual who has so markedhimself; and this is the magic property of the tattoo as a defensive talisman. Apartfrom these three meanings of the tattoo, ethnologists have noted two others: itmay serve as a sign designating sex, tribe and social status (v. Robert Lowie’sCultural Anthropology), in which case it is simply a profane version of the mysticsymbolism; and, also, as a personal adornment. This latter purpose seems to usover-simplified, but we cannot go into the matter here. In particular, tattooing isa ‘rite of entry’ or of initiation which alludes to the turning-points in the span ofa man’s life and in the development of his personality. Cola has pointed out thatsome of the most ancient monuments of pre-history, in particular those of Egypt,suggest that tattooing was practised in ancient times, for the priestess of thegoddess Hathor displayed three lines on her lower belly. He also enumerates theprincipal techniques of tattooing: incision, stitching, wounding by cutting orburning, and pseudo-tattoos or paintings on the face or body (in which case themotives are the same although the effect is transitory). Among primitive races,the principal forms of tattoos are as follows: stripes, dots, combinations of both,or numbers expressed through either, chains, knots and rosettes, crosses, stars,triangles, rhombs, circles, combinations of any two or more of these, and also,highly stylized anthropomorphic figures either complete or fragmentary (just thelimbs), etc. Cola also notes that tattoos have been used in imitative magic. Forinstance: the tattooed figure of a scorpion is credited with the power of wardingoff the actual scorpion’s sting; and the image of a bull is a guarantee of numerousprogeny (12).Taurus The second sign of the Zodiac expresses the evolutionary force ofAries—that is, the spring-time pugnacity of the ram—in an intensified form. Italso denotes the functions of fecundation and creation in both aspects, victoriousand sacrificial—related, that is, to the primordial sacrifice; an example of this isthe myth of Mithras, ‘for out of his body grow all the plants and herbs that adornthe earth with verdure, and from his seed spring all the animal species’ (Cumont,Les Mystères de Mithra). This basic idea of the bull as the force which animatesZodiacal signof Taurus."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"TEETH332forms of all kinds is deeply rooted in a great many myths. At the same time, thefact that the sign of Taurus corresponds to the number two relates it to theprinciple of duality composed of the masculine (Viraj, or Yang) and the feminine(Va c, or Yin). There is also a morphological relationship between the bull, onaccount of its head and horns, and the waxing and waning aspects of the moon,which is further evidence of the bull’s symbolic function of invigoration, at leastin the sublunary sphere. The sign of Taurus governs the throat and voice, and isin turn dominated by Venus (40).Teeth According to Allendy, teeth are the primigenial weapons of attack, andan expression of activity. Loss of one’s teeth, then, signifies fear of castration orof complete failure in life, or inhibition (56); it represents an attitude which is theinversion of that of the Primitive, who, according to the findings of anthropology,commonly adorned himself with the teeth and claws of conquered animals. Someinterpretations underline the significance of teeth in respect of the sexual aspectof energy. But of greater importance is the Gnostic concept—for which we areindebted to Leisegang’s Die Gnosis—in which the teeth constitute the battle-ments, the wall and the fortifications of the inner man, from the material orenergetic point of view, just as the eyes and the glance are the defence of the spirit.This explains the negative symbolism of the loss or fracture of the teeth.Temperance The fourteenth enigma of the Tarot pack, this card contains theimage of a winged being, clad in a red tunic and a cloak with a lining of greenish-blue, who is pouring water out of a silver vessel into a golden one. In itself, thishermaphroditic—or gynandrous—figure has a favourable significance, since it isexpressive of the coniunctio oppositorum. The act of pouring denotes the trans-formation of water as it passes from the lunar order (of silver) to the solar order(of gold), that is, from the world of transient forms and of feeling to the world offixed forms and of reason; the water here is that of the ‘Upper Ocean’—or vitalfluid. This enigma suggests universal life, and ceaseless circulation through forma-tion, regeneration and purification (59).Temple The word ‘temple’ derives from the root tem—’to divide’. Etruscansoothsayers made a division of the heavens by means of two straight lines inter-secting at a point directly above the head, the point of intersection being a projec-tion of the notion of the ‘Centre’, and the lines representing the two ‘directions’of the plane; the north-south line was called cardo and the east-west decumanus.Phenomena were interpreted according to their situation within this division ofspace. Hence, the earthly temple is seen as an image of the celestial temple and itsbasic structure is determined by considerations of order and orientation (7). Thetemple affords a particular and additional meaning to the generic symbolism of"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"TEMPLE333architectonic structures. Broadly speaking, it is the mystic significance of the‘Centre’ which prevails; the temple and, in particular, the altar, being identifiedwith the symbol of the mountain-top as the focal point of the intersection of thetwo worlds of heaven and earth. Solomon’s temple, according to Philo and FlaviusJosephus, was a figurative representation of the cosmos, and its interior wasdisposed accordingly: the incense table signified thanksgiving; the seven-branchedcandelabra stood for the seven planetary heavens; the holy table represented theterrestrial order. In addition to this, the twelve loaves of bread corresponded tothe twelve months of the year. The Ark of the Covenant symbolizes the intelligibles(14). Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance architects, each in their own way,sought to imitate this superior archetype. For example, between 1596 and 1604,imaginary reconstructions of the Temple of Solomon appeared in various workspublished in Rome and based upon holy writ, and the illustrations they containeddeeply influenced the architects of the period. Another fundamental significanceof the temple derives from its being a synthesis of the various symbols for theworld-axis, such as the hollow mountain, steps and the sacrificial mountain-peakmentioned above. In certain astrobiological cultures the temple or altar is in factbuilt upon an artificial mountain—the teocalli of Mexico is an example. A moreadvanced concept can be seen in the architectural portrayal of those essentialelements of the inner pattern of the universe founded upon the numbers three,seven, ten and twelve in particular. Seven is basic to the representation of theplanets and their derived symbolisms, and hence the Mesopotamian temple-mountains—or ziggurats—were constructed after the fashion of a seven-terracedpyramid. Each of the terraces was dedicate to a particular planet. The Babylonianziggurat known as Etemenanki (‘the house of the seven directions of heaven andearth’) was built of crude bricks overlaid with others that had been fired. A tabletin the Louvre records that in plan it measured 2,200 feet long by 1,200 wide. Thefirst level was black in colour and dedicated to Saturn, the second orange-colouredand sacred to Jupiter, the third red and consecrated to Mars, the fourth golden andsacred to the Sun, the fifth yellow (to Venus), the sixth blue (to Mercury), theseventh silver (to the Moon) (39). This order is not always observed, for some-times the Moon is situated in the sixth heaven and the Sun in the seventh (17).Berthelot, however, suggests that the ziggurat not only embraces the mysticaspects of the Mountain and the Centre (by virtue of its mass and situation) andof Steps (because of its shape), but also constitutes an image of paradise, sincevegetation appears to flourish on its terraces (7). The origins of this type ofstructure are Sumerian (7), and examples are to be found in Egypt, India, Chinaand pre-Columbian America. Eliade, in confirming this, adds that the climb to the"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"TEMPLE334Borobudur temple.Elevation and ground-plan, illustrating the mandala pattern."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"TEMPLE335top of the Mesopotamian or of the Hindu temple-mountain was equivalent to anecstatic journey to the ‘Centre’ of the world; once the traveller has reached thetopmost terrace, he breaks free from the laws of level, transcends profane spaceand enters a region of purity (18). It is hardly necessary to observe that climbingmountains implies ultimately the same mystic tendency, as can be seen in the factthat mountain heights are the chosen abode of the recluse. And the favourablesymbolic significance of the goat derives solely from his predilection for heights.Another important example of the temple-mountain, a product of Hindu culture,comes from Indo-China—the temple of Borobudur built in the centre of theisland of Java in the 8th century of our era. Basically it consists of four levels ofsquare-shaped galleries, with four more circular platforms on top surmounted byan enclosed belvedere. In form, then, it is similar to the Egyptian ziggurat, or, inthe Khmer language, a Phnom, signifying a temple-mountain comparable withMeru, the Hindu Olympus. Four flights of steps up the centre of each pyramidface lead directly from the base to the top. It would appear that the profoundestmeaning attached to this temple is of a supernatural character. Its name—Borobudur—signifies ‘the seat of secret revelation’. All graduated edifices suchas steps concern the symbolism of discontinuous spiritual evolution, that is, theseparate but progressive stages of evolution (6). At the same time, the ground-plan of the Borobudur temple is diagrammatically a true yantra, and its varioussquare and round-shaped levels constitute a mandala related to the symbolism of‘squaring the circle’ (6). The symbolic structure of the Greek temple is fundamen-tally the same as that of the lake-dwelling: that is, it symbolizes the intercommu-nication between the Three Worlds—the Lower (represented by the water andthe piles on the one hand and earth and the subterranean part on the other), theTerrestrial (the base and columns) and the Upper (suggested by the pediment).Christian cathedrals are related less to the macrocosm than to the microcosm, thehuman figure being depicted in terms of the apse (representing the head), thecross and transepts (the arms), the nave and side aisles (the body) and the altar(the heart). In the Gothic temple, the upward sweep, the vital rôle of the verticalaxis—and indeed the structure as a whole—embrace the idea of the temple-mountain with its implied synthesis of the symbolism of both macrocosm andmicrocosm. According to Schneider, the two towers usually placed at the westernface correspond to the twin-peaked ‘mountain of Mars’ in primitive megalithiccultures (and linked with the Gemini myth), while the cimborrio over the transeptis expressive of a higher synthesis, an image of heaven. Both the synthesis and thecrux of the matter are established by Gershom G. Scholem, in Les Origines de laKabbale (Paris, 1966). He recalls that God lives in his reason or that God is the"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"TENT336absolute Reason and logos of the world, and that the temple ‘is the house’ orabode of God, and thus identifies temple with reason.Tent In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs this is a determinative signrelating to that division of the soul which is known as ‘body of glory’ and whichsurrounds the spirit like a tent (19). Deriving from this hieroglyph is the broadsymbolic meaning of the tent as something which ‘envelops’. In our view, thissymbolism is closely connected with the symbolisms of weaving and of clothes.For the Greeks, the physical world—and space itself—were ‘the vestments ofthe gods’, or, in other words, comparable with the tent as something whichenvelops and hides them from sight. To tear aside the temple-veil, or to rend one’sgarments, represents a desperate attempt to achieve, by force of analogy, thetearing aside of the veil that enshrouds the mystery of the other world. Berthelotsuggests two other symbolic meanings of the tent: one related to its function as anomadic dwelling, and the other arising from the mystic significance of the desert(7).Ternary The ternary system is created by the emergence of a third (latent)element which so modifies the binary situation as to impart to it a dynamicequilibrium. As Jung has observed, Plotinus with his characteristic combinationof philosophical precision and poetic allusiveness compared Oneness (the cre-ative principle) with light, intellect with the sun, and the world-soul with themoon. Unity is split internally into three ‘moments’—the active, the passive andthe union or outcome of these two (31). Undoubtedly, the vital, human signifi-cance of the number three and the ternary embraces the multi-secular origins ofbiological evolution. The existence of two (father and mother) must almost inevi-tably be followed by three (the son) (42). As Lao-Tse says: ‘One engenders two,two engenders three, three engenders all things’ (58). Hence three has the powerto resolve the conflict posed by dualism; it is also the harmonic resolution of theimpact of unity upon duality. It symbolizes the creation of spirit out of matter,of the active out of the passive (55). Besides the triangle, there are a number ofsymbols relevant to the ternary, since, in a sense, it may be said to be the ‘innerstructure of unity’. Hence, many infernal beings that are base counterparts of theternary are three-headed like Cerberus or Hecate, or else wield three-prongedweapons such as the trident. The notion of the ‘three suns’—the East, the zenithand the West—is related to this symbolism and, according to Dontenville, theform of the tripod is derived from it. If the number four has been found the mostfitting ‘model’ to symbolize exterior or situational quantitative values, three hasproved itself the number attached to the interior or vertical order of things. Hence,disposed in accordance with the essential points pertaining to the symbolism of"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"TETRAMORPHS337level—the high, the middle and the low—it comes to be related to the ‘ThreeWorlds’ (the celestial, terrestrial and infernal), in turn closely connected with thethree-part division of man into spirit (the impalpable or the mind), the soul(sentiments) and body (the instincts), and with the moral categories of the good,the indifferent and the bad. There are some writers who analyse the ternarystructure of man in terms of intuition (or moral light), thought (intellectual light)and instinct (animal light) (54). Also corresponding to this division, modified bythe influence of a particular ruling force, are the well-known stages of mysticperfection: the unitive, illuminative and purgative; in alchemy these stages aresymbolized by the colours red, white and black. In Hindu thought the three levelsare termed sattva (the highest state or that of the predominance of the spirit),rajas (the intermediate, dynamic and transforming state) and tamas (the instinc-tive or inferior state). Eliade suggests that the image of the three levels as threecosmic divisions carved out by moral precepts and diffused by human thought isvery ancient, for it is present among the pigmies of the Semang tribe in Malayaand among other races at the very earliest stage of cultural development (18). InIreland this idea is symbolized by a three-storied tower (4). For Diel, the essentialfunctions of man are three in number: conservation, reproduction and spiritual-ization, and the deformation or perversion of these three functions is representedby the three traditional ‘enemies’ of the soul—the world, the flesh and the devil,in turn representing the inversion of the three theological Virtues. Guénon, dealingwith the ‘three worlds’ described by Dante in the Commedia, suggests the fol-lowing interesting ternary correspondences: Sattva, rajas and tamas related re-spectively to the sky, the atmosphere and the earth’s surface or interior; to thefuture, the present and the past; and to the superconscious, the conscious and theunconscious (27).Tetrachord According to Schneider, the tetrachord do, re, mi, fa may beregarded in the mystic sense as the mediator between heaven and earth; while thetetrachord sol, la, ti, do could be taken to represent the divine order. The commonnote—do—relates the symbol to the eagle (of the tetramorphs) (50).Tetramorphs This is an illustration of the quaternary principle, linked withthe concept of situation (just as the ternary is connected with that of activity) andwith the intuitive sense of spatial order. It is to the Christian tetramorphs, withtheir synthesis of the four symbols of the Evangelists, that we are bound to lookfor the purest and truest expression of this ancient and universal idea. Megalithicculture, possibly reflecting some obscure tradition of remote antiquity, was givento expressing the struggle of the gods against the monsters that, from the begin-nings of creation, sought to devour the sun. When they formed the cosmos out of"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"TETRAMORPHS338chaos, the gods, in order to safeguard what they had created, placed the lion on thecelestial mountain and posted four archers (at the Cardinal Points) to ensure thatnone might disrupt the cosmic order (50). This proves that the four CardinalPoints, besides representing the extremities of the four horizontal Directions ofSpace (which, since they pertain to the earth as the zone of manifestation, denotethe superficial and the tangible, whereas the nadir and the zenith relate to heaven),may also denote autonomous, spatial zones, as worlds in themselves. This idea isexpressed in graphic symbolism by those forms of crosses whose four limbs arerounded (to imply circular motion) or hammer-headed. These personified, au-tonomous zones may take on a beneficent or a malign character. As a defenceagainst the latter influence stand the four archers already mentioned. In thetetramorphs, the beneficent aspects of the spatial ‘order’ are all equidistant fromthe ‘Centre’. Schneider relates the animals of the tetramorph to the notes of thetetrachord. The relatively common habit of dividing a country into four provincesimplies the same basic idea. Ireland used to be called the ‘Island of the FourKings’, these Kings corresponding to four regions, with a fifth in the centre wherethe High King reigned, like the Pantokrator among the four symbols. This analogyvividly expresses the strength and cohesion of a spatial order derived intuitively,according to Jung, from spiritual and psychological principles and modelled ei-ther upon three or upon four depending upon whether those principles pertain tothe notions of activity and inner structure or to passivity and situation. Thispattern is completed by the number five: four plus the central point, sometimesdenoted by a circle or almond-shaped mandorla; or else by the number seven: fouroutside and three inside. This scheme finds expression in a great many monu-ments designed upon the basis of a square, walled-in space with three towers inthe centre—the Escorial, for instance. Before coming back to the Christiantetramorphs, let us consider some comments of Schneider about the quaternaryorder in China: ‘In the Ta-tai-li, the philosopher Tsêng-tse distinguished, as wasthe custom, four animals destined for the service of a saint; two of these animals(those covered with hair and feathers) proceed from Yin (the feminine and passiveprinciple) and two others are depicted bearing a hide, a cuirass or scales.’ In thisway they clearly reflect the four Elements (with the ‘Centre’ corresponding tothe quintessence, or the spirit)—air, fire, water and earth. Another four-partgrouping of animals is to be found in Sumerian art, composed of a lion, an eagleand a peacock mounted on the back of an ox. The Book of the Dead, on the otherhand, mentions a group of three beings with the heads of animals and a fourthbeing with a long-eared human head (like the heads in some Romanesque paint-ings). Likewise, Ezekiel’s vision contains the lion, the eagle, the ox and man.Oriental iconography must have had a great influence upon Ezekiel’s vision—and"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"TEXTURE339Egyptian images must have been specially influential. The four mystic beings inChristian tradition are usually the lion, the eagle, the ox and the (winged) man. A4th-century mosaic in the apse of Santa Pudenziana in Rome groups them in pairson either side of the crucifix. Biblical illustrations do not always follow the orderlaid down in the holy writ. St. Jerome suggested the following correspondences:the lion corresponding to resurrection, the eagle to ascension, the man to incarna-tion, the ox to passion. By comparing the four-part grouping of ancientMesopotamia (of the lion, the eagle, the ox and the peacock) with that of Ezekiel(the lion, eagle, ox and man), we arrive at the equation peacock=Man’ (50).According to Chochod, the equivalent Chinese animals afford the following cor-respondences: the dragon corresponding to the lion, the unicorn to the bull, theturtle to Man, the phoenix to the eagle (13). The spatial arrangement set out inEzekiel (i, 10) is: the lion on the right with the man above him, the ox on the leftand, above him, the eagle (50). Applying the principles of spatial symbolism,whereby, psychologically speaking, the superior is always a sublimation of theinferior, and the right side invariably appertains to the consciousness while theleft side concerns the unconscious, we arrive at the conclusion that the wingedman is the sublimation of the lion and the eagle of the ox. In esoteric thought thefour beings can be interpreted symbologically as follows: the eagle is air, intelli-gence and action; the lion is fire, strength and movement; the ox is earth, labour,forbearance and sacrifice; and the winged man is an angel symbolizing the intui-tive knowledge of truth. According to Lévi, certain ‘disciples of Socrates’ substi-tuted the cock for the eagle; the horse for the lion; the sheep for the ox (the lattersubstitution being explained by the proximity of the two zodiacal signs of Ariesand Taurus, while that of the cock for the eagle would follow from the aerialcharacter of both animals) (37, 59). Correspondences such as these, we repeat,are not identical relationships but analogies—that is, close affinities, or relation-ships between component elements of separate ‘series’, resulting from theiranalogous situation within the series. Consequently, all the various meaningsattributed to the tetramorphs help to suggest the range of their allusions, as wellas the complex mechanism governing the pattern of their properties. In Christiansymbolism, the symbolic associations of the four Evangelists (as the archersdefending truth and the order of Christ—the ‘Centre’) are: Matthew, the wingedman; Mark, the lion; Luke, the ox; John, the eagle (49) (Plate XXVIII).Texture The symbolism of texture has received scant attention nor has iteven been recognized as a problem. But certain trends of contemporary art indi-cate that the material quality of a work of art, or the relationship between theapparent surface—space—and the surface proper—the inter-relationship of points"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"THEATRE340in space—is once again being accorded that recognition it formerly enjoyed inornamental and even in figurative art. We may see in texture two essential compo-nent elements: one that produces a pattern of lateral concurrences and one which,so to speak, thrusts upwards. The first—the lateral—factor gives rise to featureswhich are sometimes pre-formal—nascent, symbolic forms only to be glimpsedafter careful study, related to the paradoxical ‘informal forms’ (symbolic blots,klexographies, paper-transfers, and so on), to the so-called ‘buried symbolism’ ofsome works of art—which has been seen as a kind of infra-configuration pro-duced by the play of light and shade, by the brush-strokes or by the backgroundpatterns—and associated also with the symbolism of composition in so far asthis creates an effect of perspective. But texture proper is determined by thequality and thickness of the impasto, of the material, and by the structure of thismaterial as it is understood in mineralogy, producing textures which are caked orfibrillar or pearlitic or porous or cellular, and so on. Broadly speaking, texturesmay be divided into the hard and smooth and the soft and porous. Since theimpression of smoothness (or continuity) is increased in proportion to the dis-tance from which it is viewed, all smooth textures may be regarded as symbolic ofremoteness and, by analogy, of cold colours. Conversely, porous textures sym-bolize nearness and warm colours, expressing a greater degree of inner dynamismin the material and in the corresponding tactile sensation. More detailed conclu-sions than the above could be educed only after a closer study of the problem oftexture.Theatre An image of the world of phenomena, for both the theatre and theworld are ‘stages’. Guénon has noted that the theatre is not limited to represent-ing the terrestrial world alone: in the Middle Ages it stood for both this world andthe next. The author symbolizes the demiurge; the actors stand in relation to theirparts as the Jungian Selbst stands to the personality (29).Theogony According to Diel, the successive reigns of Uranus, Saturn andJupiter express the progressive stages of the mind, equivalent to unconscious,conscious and superconscious (15). Primeval Neptune, as the ancient Uraniangod (associated with the Upper Waters), also symbolized the unconscious, likeall aged kings and like the sea-king himself, standing, that is, both for the historicalaspect of the unconscious—man’s ancestral memory—and for its cosmic aspect,or the latent seeds of thought which did not burgeon until the reign of Saturn(signifying time and, consequently, man as an existential being). Bysuperconsciousness is meant intuition of the supernatural and recognition of thecelestial sphere.Thighs In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs they express strength (19), asignificance which corresponds exactly to their function as the dynamic support"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"THULE341of the body. This symbolism was preserved by the Cabala, laying special empha-sis upon the firmness and majesty of the thighs.Thirst Symbolized by the dragon, and denoting the blind appetite for life,according to Evola.Thorn The thorn of the acacia, in particular, was regarded by the Egyptiansas an emblem of the mother-goddess Neith. It is also related to the world-axis, andtherefore to the cross (4). The thorn on the rose-bush helps to emphasize thecounterpoise or ‘conjunction’ between thesis and antithesis, that is, between theideas of existence and non-existence, ecstasy and anguish, pleasure and pain; thisagain is related to the symbolism of the cross. The crown of thorns adds to thebasic symbolism of the thorn the evil characteristics of all things multiple and alsothe cosmic symbolism of the circle (by virtue of the shape of the crown).Thread According to the Zohar, thread is one of the most ancient of symbols(like hair). It denotes the essential connexion between any of the different planes—the spiritual, the biological, social, etc. (38).Threshold A symbol of transition and transcendence. In architectural sym-bolism, the threshold is always given a special significance by the elaboration andenrichment of its structure by means of porches, perrons, porticoes, triumphalarches, battlements, etc., or by symbolic ornamentation of the kind which, in theWest, finds its finest expression in the Christian cathedral with its sculptedmullions, jambs, archivolts, lintels and tympana. Hence the function of the thresh-old is clearly to symbolize both the reconciliation and the separation of the twoworlds of the profane and the sacred. In the East, the function of protecting andwarning is effected by the ‘keepers of the threshold’—dragons and effigies ofgods or spirits. The Roman god Janus also denoted this dualism characteristic ofthe threshold, which can be related analogically to all other forms of duality (6).Hence the tendency to speak of the threshold between waking and sleeping.Throne In Asiatic symbolism, the throne stands midway between the moun-tain and palace on the one hand and the head-dress on the other, for they are allrhythmic variants of one and the same morphological family that symbolize—or,rather, allude to—the ‘Centre’. They are also signs expressive of synthesis,stability and unity (37). In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, the throne is adeterminative sign embracing the concepts of support, exaltation, equilibrium andsecurity (19).Thule This mythic realm derives its name from Tula—or the ‘PeerlessLand’-—which Guénon considers more ancient than Paradêsha. It is found inmany languages from Russia to Central America. In Sanskrit, Tulâ signifies ‘scales’and is related to the zodiacal sign of Libra. But there is an ancient Chinese"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"THUNDERBOLT342tradition which suggests that the antique ‘scales’ were related to the Great Bear.This would seem to point to the conclusion that Thule is identical with the polarregion, that is, with the ‘Centre’ par excellence. Thule has also been called the‘white island’—identical with the ‘white mountain’—or the symbol for the world,as well as with the Blessed Islands of Western tradition. Guénon has also men-tioned that whiteness, in relation to topographical features, is always an allusionto these paradisiac isles which man has lost and to which he returns again andagain in his legends and folktales. Guénon adds that Latin albus (white) corre-sponds to the Hebrew Lebanah, signifying the moon, and points to the examplesof Albania, Albion and Alba Longa as places signifying ‘whiteness’. The equationof island with mountain is explained by him by the fact that both express ideas ofstability, superiority and of refuge from prevailing mediocrity. The island, risingunscathed in the midst of the swirling ocean (representing the outer world—the‘sea of the passions’), corresponds to the biological symbol of the mountain, asthe ‘mount of salvation’ which towers above the transient ‘stream of forms’ (28).Thunderbolt The thunderbolt (or lightning) is celestial fire as an active force,terrible and dynamic. The thunderbolt of Parabrahman, the fire-ether of the Greeks,is a symbol of the supreme, creative power. Jupiter possesses this attribute byway of emphasizing his demiurgic nature. At the same time, the flash of lightningis related to dawn and illumination. Because of these parallels, lightning is con-nected with the first sign of the Zodiac, symbolic of the spring-principle and ofthe initial stage of every cycle (40). The thunderbolt is held to be an emblem ofsovereignty. The winged thunderbolt expresses the ideas of power and speed (8).Jupiter’s three thunderbolts symbolize chance, destiny and providence—the forcesthat mould the future (8). In the majority of religions we find that the godhead ishidden from man’s gaze, and then suddenly the lightning-flash reveals him mo-mentarily in all his active might. This image of the Logos piercing the darkness isuniversal (9). The vajra, the Tibetan symbol for both ‘thunderbolt’ and ‘dia-mond’, is also connected with the world-axis (22); but, if the cross or crucifix, thesteps and the sacrificial stake, are all symbols of man’s longing for the higherworld, the thunderbolt expresses the inverse: the action of the higher upon thelower, It is also related to the glance from the third eye of Shiva (or Siva), thedestroyer of all material forms.Tiger Two interpretations of the tiger have been offered which are easilyreconciled: ‘It is associated with Dionysos, and is a symbol of wrath and cruelty’(8); ‘In China, it is symbolic of darkness and of the new moon’ (17). For darknessis always identical with the darkness of the soul, and corresponds to that statewhich the Hindus term tamas and which falls within the general symbolism of"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"TIME343level, and also denotes the unbridled expression of the base powers of the in-stincts. Now, in China the tiger seems to play a rôle comparable with that of thelion in African and Western cultures: both animals—like the dragon—take on twodifferent characters—as the wild beast and as the tamed animal. This is what liesbehind the tiger as an allegorical expression of strength and valour in the service ofrighteousness. Five mythic tigers together constitute a symbol which is investedwith the same meaning as the tetramorphs in Christian tradition, in so far as theyare the defenders of the spatial order against the forces of chaos. The Red Tigerreigns in the south, his season being summer and his Element fire; the Black Tigerreigns in the north—winter is his season, and his Element water; the Blue Tigerreigns in the East, in the spring and amidst vegetation; the White Tiger predomi-nates in the west, in autumn and among the metals; and, finally, the Yellow Tiger(solar in colour) inhabits the earth and reigns supreme over all the other tigers.This Yellow Tiger is located in the ‘Centre’, as the Emperor was situated in theheart of China and as China lies at the centre of the world (13). This quaternarydivision plus the centre as the fifth Element is, as Jung has shown, of archetypalsignificance in the symbolism of situation. When the tiger appears in associationwith other animals, his symbolic significance varies according to the relativestatus of the animals within the hierarchy: for instance, the tiger struggling with areptile stands for the superior principle, but the converse applies if it is locked incombat with a lion or a winged being.Time Berthelot has noted that the time-pattern usually follows from thedivision of space, and this applies most particularly to the week (7). It wasindeed the awareness of the seven Directions of Space (that is, two for each of thethree dimensions plus the centre) that gave rise to the projection of the septenaryorder into time. Sunday—the Day of Rest—corresponds to the centre and, sinceall centres are linked with the ‘Centre’ or the Divine Source, it is therefore sacredin character. The idea of rest is expressive of the notion of the immobility of the‘Centre’, whereas the other six Directions are dynamic in character. At the sametime, the ‘Centre’ of space and time also retains a spiritual significance. As Elkinhas said, ‘It must not be thought that the mythic era is now past: it is also thepresent and the future, as much a state as a period.’ Corresponding, in the strict-est sense, to this zone within the circle, the ‘Centre’, is spacelessness and time-lessness, or the non-formal, or, in short, the ‘mystic nothingness’ which, inoriental thought, is the hole in the Chinese disk of jade called Pi, representingheaven. As Eliade notes, in illo tempore everything was possible—species andforms were not fixed but ‘fluid’. He goes on to point out that a return to this stateimplies the cessation of time (17). The idea that time—the week—derives from"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"TITANS344the space-pattern ought strictly to be discarded in favour of the notion that bothtime and space are the outcome of one and the same principle.Titans They signify the wild and untamable forces of primeval Nature (15).The astrobiological and mythic mind—rightly—found it impossible to accept theidea that there was no intermediate stage between the state of chaos and thecreation of a cosmic order by man-the-conqueror-of-darkness. Antediluvian mon-sters and pre-Cromagnon Man were intuited as fabulous animals, Titans, giantsand Cyclops; who struggled initially with the gods, and eventually suffered de-feat at the hands of the hero—the representative of the ‘true man’, not, that is, ofthe ‘mass man’ but of the individual who stands out as the mark of the progressiveevolution of the species and of the spirit. In the psychology of the individual thismyth still persists in the shape of monsters and of certain other base beings thatallude to the ‘shadows’—the ‘dark’ or inferior side. The beginning of Calderón’splay Life is a Dream is symbolic in this way: the cave stands for the unconscious;the imprisoned Cyprian lamenting his loss of liberty represents the ‘dark side’ ofthe dramatist—his baser part—mastered and rendered powerless by the soundjudgement and will-power of his ‘conscious side’ schooled in intellectual andmoral disciplines.Toad The inverse and infernal aspect of the frog-symbol; that is to say, thesymbolic significance is the same though in a negative sense. Or, as the traditionallanguage of esoteric thought puts it: ‘There are also certain animals whose mis-sion it is to break up the astral light by a process of absorption peculiar to them.There is something fascinating about their gaze: they are the toad and the basil-isk.’Tomb Symbolic of the body as matter (57), of transformation and of theunconscious (56). It is also sometimes a maternal and feminine symbol of ageneric kind.Torch Identified with the sun (14), it is the symbol of purification throughillumination. It was the weapon wielded by Hercules against the hydra of Lerna;its fire cauterizes wounds. It occurs in many allegories as the emblem of truth(15).Tower In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, the tower is a determinativesign denoting height or the act of rising above the common level in life or society(19). Basically, then, the tower is symbolic of ascent. During the Middle Ages,towers and belfries held the significance of watch-towers, but also, by the simpleapplication of the symbolism of level (whereby material height implies spiritualelevation), they expressed the same symbolism as the ladder—linking earth andheaven. The tower-symbol, given that it is enclosed and walled-in, is emblematic"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"TOYS345of the Virgin Mary, as can be seen in a great many allegorical designs and litanies(14). Since the idea of elevation or ascent, implicit in the tower, connotes trans-formation and evolution, the athanor (the alchemists’ furnace) was given theshape of a tower to signify inversely that the metamorphosis of matter implied aprocess of ascension. Another symbol usually mentioned in this connexion is thebronze tower in which Danae, the mother of Perseus, was imprisoned (48).Finally we would point to the analogy between the tower and man: for just as thetree is closer to the human figure than are the horizontal forms of animals, so, too,is the tower the only structural form distinguished by vertically: windows at thetopmost level, almost always large in size, correspond to the eyes and the mindof man. It is in this sense that the Tower of Babel acquired special symbolic pointas a wild enterprise bringing disaster and mental disorder (31). And, for the samereason, the sixteenth enigma of the Tarot denotes catastrophe by the image of atower struck by lightning. However, it is possible to discover a dual tendency inthe symbolism of the tower. Its upward impulse may be accompanied by adeepening movement; the greater the height, the deeper the foundations. Nietzschetalked of descent during ascent. Nerval (in Aurélia, to be precise) refers to thesymbolism of the tower and says: ‘I found myself in a tower, whose foundationswere sunk so deep into the earth and whose top was so lofty, reaching up like aspire into the sky, that my whole existence already seemed bound to be consumedin climbing up and down it.’Tower Struck by Lightning The sixteenth enigma of the Tarot pack, thiscard is an allegory showing a tower half-destroyed by a flash of lightning whichstrikes the top (symbolically equivalent to the head). This tower should beidentified with the first of the two columns known as Jachin and Boaz, that is, asa symbol of individual power and life. To emphasize that the structure is an imageof the living human being, the bricks are flesh-coloured. Pieces of the tower thathave fallen away are shown to have struck, first, a king and, secondly, the archi-tect of the tower. The evil implications of the allegory are connected with Scor-pio, and allude to the dangerous consequences of over-confidence—or the sin ofpride, with its related symbolism of the Tower of Babel. Megalomania, the wildpursuit of fanciful ideas, and small-mindedness form the context of this symbol(59).Toys Toys are symbols of temptation. According to Diel, this is the meaningwhen, in Greek mythology, the Titans offer toys to the infant Dionysos (15). Asimilar trial confronted Achilles when he was given a choice of jewels and valu-ables, among them a sword, which the hero chose without hesitation."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"TRAPEZIUM346Trapezium This geometric form unites the shape of the ox’s head with thatof the primitive stone axe. It is a symbol of sacrifice (50), and also of irregularityor abnormality since geometric figures must, by analogy, express notions ofdegrees of perfection depending upon how regular are their shapes. The scale ofregularity would run as follows: circle, square, trapezium, trapezoid.Treasure Treasure represents a sublimated form of the symbolism of thecolour gold, a solar attribute, as opposed to gold as coins, which signifies exalta-tion of and corruption by earthly desires (15). In myths, legends and folktales,the treasure is usually found in a cave; there is a double image here embracing theidea of the cave, as the mother-image or the unconscious, containing ‘the elusivetreasure’. This is an allusion to one of the fundamental mysteries of life (31)—tonothing less than the mystic ‘Centre’ within the spirit of man, which Jung hasdubbed the Selbst, to distinguish it from the mere ‘ego’. The trials and tribulationsthat attend the quest for treasure may, up to a point, be equated with the experi-ments of the alchemists in their pursuit of transmutation (32). Jung maintainsthat the treasure which the hero wins only after painful effort is nothing less thanhimself reborn in the cave in which introversion or regression has confined him.The hero, in so far as he remains bound to the mother-principle, is himself thedragon, but in so far as he is reborn of the mother, he is the conqueror of thedragon (and therefore of his former self) (31). In truth, all striving and all sufferingare steps along the path of moral progress. And it is possible to equate the onewith the other, for as Eliphas Lévi—rightly, in our view—asserts, ‘to suffer is tostrive’. The truth of his remark is borne out by Rorschach’s discovery that colourand movement are expressions respectively of feeling and of activity, denotingquantities that are analogous and yet opposed, as it were the two ‘balance-pans’of the psyche. But it is only when born of conscious choice that work andsuffering contribute to progress in its profoundest sense of self-awareness, virtueand superiority.The dragon in the cave may also represent the sevenfold malignity of theseven planets (as the seven deadly sins), whereas the hero’s weapons are the god-given powers which make victory possible. Gold coins, however, and all otherderived concepts such as, for example, a bulging wallet, symbolize ‘treasureeasily come by’ (that is, earthly desires, the sensual pleasures, love in so far as itis selfish love) and in consequence ‘easily lost’.Tree The tree is one of the most essential of traditional symbols. Very oftenthe symbolic tree is of no particular genus, although some peoples have singledout one species as exemplifying par excellence the generic qualities. Thus, the oakwas sacred to the Celts; the ash to the Scandinavian peoples; the lime-tree in"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"TREE347Germany; the fig-tree in India. Mythological associations between gods and treesare extremely frequent: so, Attis and the pine; Osiris and the cedar; Jupiter andthe oak; Apollo and the laurel, etc. They express a kind of ‘elective correspon-dence’ (26, 17). In its most general sense, the symbolism of the tree denotes thelife of the cosmos: its consistence, growth, proliferation, generative and regenera-tive processes. It stands for inexhaustible life, and is therefore equivalent to asymbol of immortality. According to Eliade, the concept of ‘life without death’stands, ontologically speaking, for ‘absolute reality’ and, consequently, the treebecomes a symbol of this absolute reality, that is, of the centre of the world.Because a tree has a long, vertical shape, the centre-of-the-world symbolism isexpressed in terms of a world-axis (17). The tree, with its roots underground andits branches rising to the sky, symbolizes an upward trend (3) and is thereforerelated to other symbols, such as the ladder and the mountain, which stand for thegeneral relationship between the ‘three worlds’ (the lower world: the underworld,hell; the middle world: earth; the upper world: heaven). Christian symbolism—and especially Romanesque art—is fully aware of the primary significance of thetree as an axis linking different worlds (14). According to Rabanus Maurus,however, in his Allegoriae in Sacram Scripturam (46), it also symbolizes humannature (which follows from the equation of the macrocosm with the microcosm).The tree also corresponds to the Cross of Redemption and the Cross is oftendepicted, in Christian iconography, as the Tree of Life (17). It is, of course, thevertical arm of the Cross which is identified with the tree, and hence with the‘world-axis’. The world-axis symbolism (which goes back to pre-Neolithic times)has a further symbolic implication: that of the central point in the cosmos. Clearly,the tree (or the cross) can only be the axis linking the three worlds if it stands inthe centre of the cosmos they constitute. It is interesting to note that the threeworlds of tree-symbolism reflect the three main portions of the structure of thetree: roots, trunk and foliage. Within the general significance of the tree as world-axis and as a symbol of the inexhaustible life-process (growth and development),different mythologies and folklores distinguish three or four different shades ofmeaning. Some of these are merely aspects of the basic symbolism, but others areof a subtlety which gives further enrichment to the symbol. At the most primitivelevel, there are the ‘Tree of Life’ and the ‘Tree of Death’ (35), rather than, as inlater stages, the cosmic tree and the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil; butthe two trees are merely two different representations of the same idea. Thearbor vitae is found frequently, in a variety of forms, in Eastern art. The—apparently purely decorative—motif of hom (the central tree), placed betweentwo fabulous beings or two animals facing each other, is a theme of Mesopotamian"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"TREE348origin, brought both to the West and to the Far East by Persians, Arabs andByzantines (6). In Romanesque decoration it is the labyrinthine foliage of theTree of Life which receives most emphasis (the symbolic meaning remainingunchanged, but with the addition of the theme of Entanglement) (46). An impor-tant point in connexion with the ‘cosmic tree’ symbol is that it often appearsupside down, with its roots in heaven and its foliage on earth; here, the naturalsymbolism based on the analogy with actual trees has been displaced by a mean-ing expressing the idea of involution, as derived from the doctrines of emanation:namely, that every process of physical growth is a spiritual opus in reverse.Thus, Blavatsky says: ‘In the beginning, its roots were generated in Heaven, andgrew out of the Rootless Root of all-being. . . . Its trunk grew and developed,crossing the plains of Pleroma, it shot out crossways its luxuriant branches, firston the plane of hardly differentiated matter, and then downward till they touchedthe terrestrial plane. Thus . . . (it) is said to grow with its roots above and itsbranches below’ (9). This concept is already found in the Upanishads, where it issaid that the branches of the tree are: ether, air, fire, water and earth. In the Zoharof Hebrew tradition it is also stated that ‘the Tree of Life spreads downwardsfrom above, and is entirely bathed in the light of the sun’. Dante, too, portrays thepattern of the celestial spheres as the foliage of a tree whose roots (i.e. origin)spread upwards (Uranus). In other traditions, on the other hand, no such inver-sion occurs, and this symbolic aspect gives way to the symbolism of verticalupward growth. In Nordic mythology, the cosmic tree, called Yggdrasil, sends itsroots down into the very core of the earth, where hell lies (Völuspâ, 19;Grimnismâl, 31) (17).We can next consider the two-tree symbolism in the Bible. In Paradise therewere the Tree of Life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Both werecentrally placed in the Garden of Eden. In this connexion, Schneider says (50):‘Why does God not mention the Tree of Life to Adam? Is it because it was asecond tree of knowledge or is it because it was hidden from the sight of Adamuntil he came to recognize it with his new-found knowledge of good and evil—ofwisdom? We prefer the latter hypothesis. The Tree of Life, once discovered, canconfer immortality; but to discover it is not easy. It is “hidden”, like the herb ofimmortality which Gilgamesh seeks at the bottom of the sea, or is guarded bymonsters, like the golden apples of the Hesperides. The two trees occur morefrequently than might be expected. At the East gate of the Babylonian heaven, forinstance, there grew the Tree of Truth and the Tree of Life.’ The doubling of thetree does not modify the symbol’s fundamental significance, but it does addfurther symbolic implications connected with the dual nature of the Gemini: the"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"TREE349tree, under the influence of the symbolism of the number two, then reflects theparallel worlds of living and knowing (the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowl-edge). As is often the case with symbols, many more specialized meanings havebeen developed on the basis of the general tree-symbolism already outlined. Hereare a few: firstly, the triple tree. According to Schneider, the Tree of Life, when itrises no higher than the mountain of Mars (the world of phenomena) is regardedas a pillar supporting heaven. It is made up of three roots and three trunks—orrather one central trunk with two large boughs corresponding to the two peaks ofthe mountain of Mars (the two faces of Janus). Here the central trunk or axisunifies the dualism expressed in the two-tree symbolism. In its lunar aspect, it isthe Tree of Life and emphasizes the moon’s identification with the realm ofphenomena; in its solar aspect it relates to knowledge and death (which, in sym-bolism, are often associated). In iconography, the Tree of Life (or the lunar side ofa double or triple tree) is depicted in bloom; the tree of death or knowledge (or thesolar side of a double or triple tree) is dry, and shows signs of fire (50). Psychol-ogy has interpreted this symbolic duality in sexual terms, Jung affirming that thetree has a symbolic, bisexual nature, as can also be seen in the fact that, in Latin,the endings of the names of trees are masculine even though their gender isfeminine (31). This conjunctio confirms the unifying significance of the cosmictree. Other symbols are often brought into association with the tree, sometimesby analogy with real situations, sometimes through the juxtaposition of psychicimages and projections. The resulting composite symbolism is, of course, richerand more complex, but also more specific, and consequently less spontaneousand of less scope. The tree is frequently related to the rock or the mountain onwhich it grows. On the other hand, the Tree of Life, as found in the celestialJerusalem, bears twelve fruits, or sun-shapes (symbols of the Zodiac, perhaps).In many images, the sun, the moon and the stars are associated with the tree, thusstressing its cosmic and astral character. In India we find a triple tree, with threesuns, the image of the Trimurti; and in China a tree with the twelve suns of theZodiac (25). In alchemy, a tree with moons denotes the lunar opus (the LesserWork) and the tree with suns the solar opus (the Great Work). The tree with thesigns of the seven planets (or metals) stands for prime matter (protohyle), fromwhich all differentiations emerge. Again, in alchemy, the Tree of Knowledge iscalled arbor philosophica (a symbol of evolution, or of the growth of an idea, avocation or a force). ‘To plant the philosophers’ tree’ is tantamount to stimulat-ing the creative imagination (32). Another interesting symbol is that of the ‘sea-tree’ or coral, related to the mythic sea king. The fountain, the dragon and thesnake are also frequently related to the tree. Symbol LVII of Bosch’s Ars Symbolica"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"TREES AND FLOWERS350shows the dragon beside the tree of the Hesperides. As regards the symbolism oflevels, it is possible to establish a vertical scale of analogies: dragons and snakes(primal forces) are associated with the roots; the lion, the unicorn, the stag andother animals expressing the ideas of elevation, aggression and penetration, corre-spond to the trunk; and birds and heavenly bodies are brought into relation withthe foliage. Colour correspondences, are: roots/black; trunk/white; foliage/red.The snake coiled round the tree introduces another symbol, that of the spiral. Thetree as world-axis is surrounded by the sequence of cycles which characterizesthe revealed world. This is an interpretation applicable to the serpent watching atthe foot of the tree on which the Golden Fleece is suspended (25). Endlessinstances could be quoted of such associations of symbols, full of psychologicalimplications. Another typical combination of symbols, extremely frequent infolktales, is that of the ‘singing tree’. In the Passio S. Perpetuae XI (Cambridge,1891) we read that St. Saturius, a martyr alongside St. Perpetua, dreamed on theeve of his martyrdom ‘that, having shed his mortal flesh, he was carried eastwardby four angels. Going up a gentle slope, they reached a spot bathed in the mostbeautiful light: it was Paradise opening before us’, he adds, ‘like a garden, withtrees bearing roses and many other flower-blooms; trees tall as cypresses, singingthe while’ (46). The sacrificial stake, the harp-lyre, the ship-of-death and thedrum are all symbols derived from the tree seen as the path leading to the otherworld (50) (Plate XXIX). Gershom G. Scholem, in Les Origines de la Kabbale,speaks of the symbolism of the tree in connexion with hierarchical, vertical struc-tures (such as the ‘sefirothic tree’ of the Cabbala, a theme that we cannot develophere). He asks himself whether the ‘tree of Porphyry’, which was a widespreadsymbol during the Middle Ages, was of a similar nature. In any case, it is reminis-cent of the Arbor elementalis of Raymond Lull (1295), whose trunk symbolizesthe primordial substance of Creation, or hyle, and whose branches and leavesrepresent its nine accidents. The figure ten has the same connotation as in thesefiroth, the ‘sum of all the real which can be determined by numbers’.Trees and Flowers In Chinese symbology, they usually symbolize longev-ity and fertility. Predominantly popular are the bamboo, the cherry-tree and thepine, called ‘the three friends’ because all three are evergreen. In painting theyfrequently appear together (2).Triangle The geometric image of the ternary and, in the symbolism ofnumbers, equivalent to the number three. In its highest sense it concerns theTrinity. In its normal position with the apex uppermost it also symbolizes fireand the aspiration of all things towards the higher unity—the urge to escape fromextension (signified by the base) into non-extension (the apex) or towards the"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"TRIDENT351Origin or the Irradiating Point. Nicholas of Cusa said of the triangle that, trun-cated (without its apex), it served the alchemists as a symbol of air; inverted (withapex pointing downwards) it symbolizes water; and inverted but with the tip cutoff, it symbolizes earth. Two complete triangles, one in the normal position andone inverted—representing, respectively, fire and water—superimposed so as toform a six-pointed star (called Solomon’s seal), constitute a symbol of the humansoul. A triangle surmounted by horns was the Carthaginian symbol for Tanit (orTanith) (12).Trident Various interpretations of the trident or three-pointed spear havebeen advanced, ranging from Eliade’s suggestion that originally it was a represen-tation of the teeth of sea-monsters (17), to Diel’s explanation which we willdiscuss below. It is an attribute of Neptune and of Satan. According to Bayley, itis a corrupt form of the cross (4), adapted, that is, in such a way as to suggest avicious character. More precisely, every instrument, object or being having threemembers or parts where one would normally suffice realizes a trebling of itssymbolic force or potentiality (8). This is born out by Zimmer’s comment thatthe trident denotes threefold hostility. The third point might well correspond tothe third eye of Shiva (or Siva) the Destroyer, since the trident is also an attributeof this god. The fact that the trident was the weapon of the Roman retiarius ishighly significant, for the net which he also used relates him to the Uranian deity,whereas the sword wielded by the mirmillo gladiator suggests the heroic, solarson. Hence, the trident, in the hands of the retiarius, would seem to be an at-tribute of archaic, paternal power opposed to the unique heroism of the solar son.Diel, with his moralist approach, carries the negative implication of the trident toits logical conclusion, suggesting that it symbolizes triple sin, corresponding tothe perversion of the three ‘vital urges’ of nutrition or preservation (transformedinto possession, property and authority); reproduction (lust); and spiritualiza-tion or evolution (which, in its negative aspect, becomes vanity). Hence it is anattribute of the god of the unconscious and of sin—Neptune, whose realm is thehaunt of monsters and base forms of life. The triple character of the trident is an‘infernal replica of the Trinity’, comparable with the three heads of Cerberus orof triform Hecate (17). On the other hand, a favourable interpretation has alsobeen ascribed to the trident; Charles Ploix, in La Nature et les dieux, associates itwith the wand used in water-divining (2), although this interpretation seems torest on somewhat dubious grounds. According to Father Heras, the trident was, inthe proto-Indian era, an attribute of god.Triform A second name of Hecate, who, with her three heads, presided,according to Servius, over birth, life and death (representing the past, the present"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"TRIFORM352and the future). This is a teratological application of the principle of triplicity ortriunity (8). Similar in significance is the Trimurti (embracing creation, preserva-tion and destruction) formed by Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva (60). Triform symbol-ism conforms to the general symbolism of ternary forms, in its depiction ofpower as holiness, science and armed might, in turn clearly corresponding to thespirit, the intellect and vitality (28).Triple Enclosure A schematic pattern of various forms (three squares orconcentric circles, combinations of both or combinations with polygons) which,according to Louis Charbonneau-Lassay in L’Ésotérisme de quelques symbolesgéométriques chrétiens, symbolizes the ternary or triple make-up of man: body,soul, spirit; or of the world: physical universe, intelligible or intellectual universe,spiritual or transcendental universe. This symbol, in the form of squares, hasbeen found engraved on some stelae such as that of Suèvres (Orléannais, France),dating back roughly to the Druidic or Gallo-Roman period. Similar symbols havebeen found engraved in bone, attributed to the Merovingian period, and in thegraffiti of the Knights Templars in the castle of Chinon (1308). The reverse ofEnglish coins in the 14th and 15th centuries and the obverse of Castilian ‘ana-gram’ coins are triple enclosures in pattern and perhaps in significance.Tripod Dontenville regards this as a solar symbol, not because it has a circulartop but because of the three supports which can be said to correspond to thethree solar ‘moments’—the rising, the zenith and the setting (16). The symbolicfigure of the triskeles—three legs joined together to form a kind of swastika—issimilar in meaning according to Dontenville (16), but Ortiz holds that it is expres-sive of ‘swift movement’ (41).Triumph The symbols of triumph are related to those of power. In addition,there are elements of exhibition and exaltation; and thereby they become con-nected with the symbols of verticality, ascension and radiance, and with the solarsymbols (crown, palm, gold, purple, chariot, white horses, stepped temples). Itwas probably the Romans who created the most perfect form of triumphal sym-bolism for the glorification of their imperatores and Caesars. The standards of thelegions and cohorts, with an eagle or a phoenix on the point of a lance, arethemselves another example of triumphal symbols.Triple enclosure"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"TURTLE353Trumpet Since it is a metal instrument, it corresponds to the Elements of fireand water and also to the twin-peaked Mountain of Mars. Metallic instrumentspertain to nobles and warriors, whereas wooden instruments, from their associa-tions with the valley, are more properly related to the common folk and toshepherds (50). The trumpet symbolizes the yearning for fame and glory (8). Onthe other hand, the horn, because of its shape, is connected with the symbolismof the animal-horn (50).Tunic Whereas the cloak symbolizes the outer bounds of the personality orthe ‘mask’ which envelops the Jungian Selbst, the tunic may denote the self or thesoul, that is, the zone in most direct contact with the spirit. An individual clothedin an orange-coloured tunic is ‘afire’, since orange is the colour symbolizing fireand passion. The tunic of Nessus, which was the cause of Hercules’ death byburning, was of this same colour. Holes in the tunic (or a suit), or tatters, areequivalent to scars and symbolic of the wounds in the soul. Concerning theorange-coloured tunic, Zimmer relates that in India this was the garment in whichcriminals were clothed when condemned to death for terrible crimes (60).Turtle The turtle has a variety of meanings, all of which are organicallyrelated. In the Far East its significance is cosmic in implication. As Chochod hasobserved: ‘The primordial turtle has a shell that is rounded on the top to repre-sent heaven, and square underneath to represent the earth’ (13). To the Negroes ofNigeria it suggests the female sex organ (12) and it is in fact taken as an emblem oflubricity. In alchemy it was symbolic of the ‘massa confusa’ (32). These dispar-ate senses have, nevertheless, one thing in common: in every case, the turtle is asymbol of material existence and not of any aspect of transcendence, for evenwhere it is a combination of square and circle it alludes to the forms of themanifest world and not to the creative forces, nor to the Origin, still less to theirradiating Centre. In view of its slowness, it might be said to symbolize naturalevolution as opposed to spiritual evolution which is rapid or discontinuous to adegree. The turtle is also an emblem of longevity. An engraving in theHypnerotomachia Poliphili (p. 79) depicts a woman holding a pair of outspreadwings in one hand and a turtle in the other. The counterbalancing of one with theOriental imageof the turtle."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"TURTLE DOVE354other would suggest that the turtle is the inversion of the wings; that is, that sincethe wings signify elevation of the spirit, the turtle would denote the fixed elementof alchemy although only in its negative aspect. In short, then, it would stand forturgidity, involution, obscurity, slowness, stagnation and highly concentratedmaterialism, etc. Perhaps this is the explanation of the turtles in Moreau’s paint-ing of Orpheus with their disquieting negativeness.Turtle Dove A symbol of fidelity and of affection among human beings (8).It is to be found in many allegories and is sometimes confused with the dove.Twelve Strictly, of all the numbers, twelve is the broadest in scope, for theTarot formulas are such that they contain two groups of eleven and four offourteen, but the components of these numbers have no archetypal significance.Given that the two essential prototypes of quantity are the numbers three andfour (signifying respectively dynamism or inner spirituality, and stability orouter activity), it can be argued that their sum and their multiplication give thetwo numbers which are next in importance: seven and twelve. The latter corre-sponds to the geometrical dodecagon; but it may also be associated with thecircle, since their symbolic meaning is practically identical. For this reason, sys-tems or patterns based upon the circle or the cycle tend to have twelve as the end-limit. Even when structures are made up of less than twelve elements at first, theylater tend towards the superior number of twelve, as, for example, in music,where the seven-note modal scale has developed into the twelve-note system ofthe Arnold Schoenberg school. Other examples are: the twelve hours on the clock-face; the twelve months of the year; the twelve major gods of many mythologies,as a kind of amplification of the seven planets; and the markings of the wind-rose(corresponding to Eurus, Solanus, Notus, Auster, Africus, Euroauster, Zephyrus,Stannus, Ireieus, Boreas, Aquilo, Volturnus). All these examples, then, prove theexistence of an order founded upon patterns of twelve, which can be split upeither into the ‘inner’ three-part division of the ‘outer’ or circumstantial patternof four, or else into the ‘outer’ four-part division of the ‘inner’ and actual patternof three. For the Vedic Indians, the twelve middle days of winter (from Christmasto Epiphany) were an image and a replica of the entire year; and a similar traditionexists in China (17). In our view, the symbolism of the Zodiac lies at the root ofall these systems based upon the number twelve, that is, the idea that the fourElements may appear in three different ways (levels or grades), giving twelvedivisions. It is for these reasons that Saint-Yves draws the sociological conclusionthat, among groups of human beings in the line of symbolic tradition, ‘the circlewhich comes highest and nearest to the mysterious centre, consists of twelvedivisions representing the supreme initiation (the faculties, the virtues and knowl-"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"TWINS355edge) and corresponding, among other things, to the Zodiac’. Guénon (who quotesthe above) adds that the twelve-formula is to be found in the ‘circular council’ ofthe Dalai Lama, and (quite apart from the twelve apostles) in the legendaryknights of the Round Table and the historical Twelve Peers of France. Similarly,the Etruscan state was subdivided into twelve minor states; and Romulus createdtwelve lictors (28).Twilight (or Half-light) The half-light of morning or evening is a symbol ofdichotomy, representing the dividing-line which at once joins and separates a pairof opposites. Frazer relates an Indian legend which embodies a curious mythicstratagem: ‘Indra swore to the demon Namuci that he would slay him neither byday nor by night. . . . But he killed him in the morning-twilight’ (21). Half-light ischaracterized by lack of definition and ambivalence, and is therefore closelyrelated to the space-symbolism of the Hanged Man or of any object suspendedbetween heaven and earth. Evening-light is associated with the West, symbolizingthe location of death. Dontenville suggests that it is, therefore, not by chance thatPerseus goes westward in his quest for the Gorgon’s head. And the same may besaid of Hercules in his journey to the garden of the Hesperides, since the place andthe time of sunset imply the end of one cycle (corresponding to the zodiacal signof Pisces) and the beginning of another. According to legend, Merlin buried thesun in Mount Tombe. King Arthur fell mortally wounded in the West, and therehe was healed by Morgana the Fairy (a name deriving from Morgen—morning)(16).Twins In representations of the sacrificium mithriacum, the two dadophori,Cautes and Cautopates, are very frequently shown, one with his torch pointingupwards and the other with his turned downwards: the one is alight, the otherextinguished. Cumont considers that they symbolize life and death. Sometimesone dadophorus has the head of a bull and the other that of a scorpion, confirmingCumont’s conclusion. They also signify the two essential aspects of the sun: itsalternate appearance and disappearance—day and night (31). A careful study ofPrimitive traditions and of the mythologies of the more advanced cultures hasenabled us to draw the conclusion that most of them incorporate the symbol ofthe twins, such as the Vedic Asvins (or Ashwins), Mitra and Varuna, Liber andLibera, Romulus and Remus, Isis and Osiris, Apollo and Artemis, Castor andPollux, Amphion and Zethus, or Arion and Orion. On some occasions the addi-tion of a third figure (brother or sister) permits of further associations, as, forexample, Castor and Helen, or Osiris and Set. They are always mythic beingsborn of an immortal father and a mortal mother. The respective characteristics oftheir parents—expressed in landscape-symbolism by the dualism of the moun-"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"TWISTED SHAPES356tain (representing heaven) and the valley or water (representing earth)—are notfused in their offspring, but discrete. Thus, one brother may be a fierce hunter,another a peaceful shepherd (50). In sum, these beings are usually beneficentdeities (17). Through the influence of totemism or of animalistic symbolism, theyappear fairly often in the symbolic guise of animals: as birds (35)—the myth ofoviparous human birth is a parallel manifestation of this; or as lions (that is, thewild lion and the tame lion, or day and night) (4); or as horses, one white orchestnut, the other black. The twin Indian Ashwins (or Asvins) are depicted inthis latter form, one in light and the other in darkness, as if the chariot they drawis ever running along the borderline of dusk. But most commonly one of the twinssignifies the eternal side of man, his inheritance from his celestial father (as areflection of the hieros gamos), or, in short, his soul, and the other twin indicatesthe mortal side (40). However, they also symbolize the counterbalancing prin-ciples of good and evil, and hence the twins are portrayed as mortal enemies. Thisis what lies behind the Egyptian myth of Osiris and Set and the Persian myth ofAhuramazda and Angramainyu (or Ahriman) as well as the Iroquois myth ofHawneyn and Hanegoasegeh and the Slav myth of Bielbog and Chernobog (orZcernoboch) (the ‘white god’ and the ‘black god’) (35). Since the life-principle isusually allied with evil, the principle of good has to fall back upon ascetic spiri-tuality; it follows then, that, in order to achieve immortality, it is essential toaccept the maxim ‘Deny thyself’. In India, such duality is precisely exemplifiedin the two names of Atman (or individual soul) and Brahman (world-soul); up toa point, they are pantheistic in tendency. Friedrich Nietzsche exactly describedthe mystic message implied in this partial negation necessary for the salvation ofthe spiritual essence of Man, with his advice: ‘Cast into the abyss that which liesmost heavily upon you. Let man forget. . . . Divine is the art of forgetting. If youwould raise yourself—if you yourself would dwell among the heights, cast intothe sea that which lies most heavily upon you’; yet Nietzsche, as a Westerner,does not succeed in escaping from self.Twisted Shapes These fall within the broad group of symbolic abnormali-ties, in so far as they deviate from the norm in shape and significance (where, forexample, the normal shape is straight or curved)."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"UNICORN357UUmbrella This symbol is invariably related to the sun-shade, which is a solaremblem of the monarchs of certain peoples. But its mechanism has tended to lendit a phallic significance. It is a father-symbol for this reason and because of itsimplications of protection and of mourning (42).Undines Water-nymphs, or undines, are symbolically the inverse of sirens:in the latter, the fishy part of their body refers to the relationship between thewaters (and the moon) and woman; with undines, it is the feminine—or peril-ous—nature of the waters which is symbolized. Krappe notes that these nymphsare usually wicked in so far as they represent the treacherousness of rivers, lakesand torrents.Unicorn Symbolic of chastity and also an emblem of the sword or of theword of God (20, 4). Tradition commonly presents it as a white horse with asingle horn sprouting from its forehead, but according to esoteric belief it has awhite body, a red head and blue eyes. Legend has it that it is tireless when pursuedyet falls meekly to the ground when it is approached by a virgin (59). This seemsto suggest that it is symbolic of sublimated sex. In China, the animal known asCh’i-lin is identified by some writers with the unicorn, whereas there are otherswho dispute this because it has two horns. It is an attribute of high-ranking armyofficers and an emblem of uprightness and high birth. Its skin is of five colours—red, yellow, blue, white and black; its cry is like the sound of bells. In legend it isreputed to live for a thousand years and to be the noblest of animals (5). Jung, inhis work on the relationships between psychology and alchemy, has studied agreat many aspects of this fabulous animal, concluding that, broadly speaking, ithas no one definite symbolic character but rather many different variants embrac-ing single-horned animals, both real and fabulous, such as the sword-fish orcertain types of dragon. He notes that the unicorn is at times transmuted into awhite dove, offering the explanation that on the one hand it is related to primor-dial monsters while on the other it represents the virile, pure and penetratingforce of the spiritus mercurialis. He quotes the remark of Honorius of Autun inhis Speculum de Mysteriis Ecclesiae, as follows: ‘The very fierce animal withonly one horn is called unicorn. In order to catch it, a virgin is put in a field; theanimal then comes to her and is caught, because it lies down in her lap. Christ isrepresented by this animal, and his invincible strength by its horn. He, who lay"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"URN358down in the womb of the Virgin, has been caught by the hunters; that is to say, hewas found in human shape by those who loved him.’ However, in Antiquity theunicorn appears on occasion with certain evil characteristics. The PhysiologusGraecus comments that it is ‘an animal fleet of foot, single-horned and harbouringill will towards men’. As Jung has observed, the Church does not recognize thisnegative side of the unicorn. On the other hand, the alchemists made use of itsambivalent implications in order to symbolize the Monstrum Hermaphroditum.The universality of this symbolic being, non-existent in nature, is indeed surpris-ing; it is, for instance, in the Vedas. Regarding its iconography, of special interestare the 15th-century tapestries in the Cluny Museum in Paris, with their illustra-tions of La Dame à la Licorne (32).Urn A symbol of containment which, like all such symbols, corresponds tothe world of things feminine. The urn of gold or silver, associated with a whitelily, is the favourite emblem of the Virgin in religious iconography. The urn witha lid is one of the eight emblems of good luck in Chinese Buddhism, and signifiesOneness, or that state of supreme intelligence which triumphs over birth anddeath (5).Utensils Generally speaking, their symbolic significance amounts to a simpletransference to the spiritual plane of their practical and utilitarian function (56).Secondary implications are prompted by the particular shape, material and colourof the utensil.VValley Within the symbolism of landscapes, the valley, which, because it islow-lying, is considered to lie at the level of the sea, represents a neutral zone aptfor the development of all creation and for all material progress in the world ofmanifestation. Its characteristic fertility stands in contrast to the nature of thedesert (symbolically a place of purification), of the ocean (which represents theOrigin of life but which, in relation to man’s existence, is sterile), and of themountain (the region characterized by snows and the ascetic, contemplative life,or by intellectual illumination). In short, the valley is symbolic of life itself and isthe mystic abode of shepherd and priest (51)."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"VENUS359Vase In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, this is a determinative signcorresponding to Nu (or Nun or Nou), the god of repose, immanence and accep-tance (19), The ‘full vase’ is associated with the Plant of Life and is an emblem offertility (17). The golden vase or pot filled with white lilies is the commonemblem of the Virgin Mary.Vault According to Leo Frobenius, in prehistoric and protohistoric thinking,every vault represents the union of the sky-god with the earth-goddess. Theseparation of the two deities created the void (22).Vegetation Vegetation, in all its forms, has two main implications: firstly,pertaining to its annual cycle, whence its symbolism of death and resurrectionfollowing the pattern of winter and spring; and, secondly, that of its abundance,giving rise to its significance in connexion with fertility and fecundity. Vegetationrites are celebrated in many different regions, and on dates ranging from Carnival(Shrove-tide) to the feast of St. John (24th June) (17). In every case, the aim is toencourage the cosmic forces to continue to bring about the annual regeneration oflife.Vehicles The various ancient and modern vehicles are corruptions of theessential symbol of the chariot. Those that possess some individual characteris-tics are connected with existence itself; those that are generic in character pertainto the collective life (56). According to Jung, the particular type of vehicle thatappears relates to the individual’s characteristic movement—whether lively orslow, regular or irregular—or the character of his inner life or his mind, or whetherhis ideas are his own or borrowed, and so on (32). Every vehicle is an expressionof the body (including the mind and thought) or, in other words, of the spirit in itsexistential aspect. Thus, from the symbolic point of view, to see in the imagina-tion, or in dreams, a chariot or a car on fire has the same significance as the visionof a man in an orange-coloured tunic (since orange is the colour of fire).Veil In addition to partaking of the generic symbolism of fabrics, the veilsignifies the concealment of certain aspects of truth or of the deity. Guénon drawsattention to the double meaning of the verb ‘to reveal’ (‘re-veil’), which may meaneither to pull back the veil or to cover again with a veil. The Bible tells us thatwhen Moses came down from mount Sinai ‘the skin of his face shone’ so that hehad to cover his face with a veil while he spoke with the people because they wereunable to look upon his shining face (Exodus xxxiv, 29-35) (28).Venus The planet Venus is, in alchemy, related to the goddess of love and alsoto copper. In astrology, it is associated with the Moon in particular and withMars. Its spiritual significance has two aspects: that of spiritual love and that ofmere sexual attraction, so that some writers have come to regard its true symbolicsignificance as physical and mechanical in character."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"VERBS360Verbs Every verb denotes an action, a passion or an operation, and itssymbolism is a direct consequence of the transference of this material sense to thespiritual plane. For example, to take food is symbolic of receiving spiritual orintellectual nourishment; to kill is to eradicate a given being from the mind; totravel is to move, by exercise of the imagination and awareness, away from oneworld and towards another; and so on.Verticality Since all symbolism is, in essence, dynamic, the idea of vertical-ity is closely related to upward movement, which, by analogy with the symbol-ism of space and with moral concepts, corresponds symbolically to the tendencytowards spiritualization (dealt with in connexion with the symbolism of Lev-els—q.v.). Symbolic theory attaches such importance to the level or height of agiven figure (in relation to the norm) that it can even define the significance of thisform or being solely by reference to its vertical ‘height’. Bachelard corroboratesthis and even goes so far as to say that ‘it is impossible to ignore the vertical axisin expressing moral values’ (3).Vessel In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, a determinative sign corre-sponding to the idea of receptacles in general. It is a symbol whose immediatesignificance is that of the context in which the intermingling of forces takes place,giving rise to the material world. From this sense arises a secondary symbolism—that of the female matrix (19).Victory The crown as an expression of fulfilment, and the palm in the senseof elevation and exaltation, are the two outward attributes of victory. WhenVictory is personified as a winged figure, the allusion is to its spiritual worth.Whether, as in the Mithraic mysteries, the victory is over the bull, or whether itis over the dragon or some other such monster, as in the exploits of Hercules,Perseus, Bellerophon and St. George, the significance of the act of conquering liesin the disarming of the adversary and his subjugation to the will of the victor. Inaddition to the objective and cosmic sense of victory, there is also a psychologicalimplication: confrontation with another force presupposes resemblance, and there-fore the conquered force is the very inferiority of the conqueror himself.Vine Just as the grape has an ambivalent symbolism, pertaining to sacrificeand to fecundity, so wine frequently appears as a symbol both of youth and ofeternal life. In the earliest times, the supreme ideogram of life was a vine-leaf.According to Eliade, the Mother-Goddess was known by the Primitives as ‘TheGoddess of the Vines’, representing the unfailing source of natural creation (17).Virgo The sixth sign of the Zodiac. For the Egyptians it was identical withIsis. Since it is governed by Mercury and corresponds to the number six, it issymbolic of hermaphroditism, or that state which is characterized by dual—positive and negative—forces. Hence Virgo is sometimes depicted with the sym-"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"VULCAN361bol of the soul or the Seal of Solomon (two triangles, representing fire and water,superimposed and intersecting to form a six-pointed star) (40). In mythology andin religions generally, this symbol is always associated with the birth of a god ora demigod, as the supreme expression of the dynamic consciousness (52) (PlateXXX).Volcano In mythology, the volcano is invested with antithetical powers: onthe one hand there is the extraordinary fertility of the volcanic earth in suchregions as Naples, California or Japan; but on the other hand the destructive fireof the volcano is linked with the idea of evil. This accounts for the variety of ideasassociated with the volcano. For the Persians, for instance, it was quite simplythe Great Adversary, Ahriman, who, in the form of a huge dragon or serpent, wasshackled (as in the comparable myth of Prometheus) to mount Demâvand, thevolcano of Elburz, there to await the Day of Judgement (35). The volcano issymbolic not only of the primary force of nature and of the fire of life (represent-ing creation and destruction) (4), but also of the original ‘site’ of the ‘descent’ ofthe Elements—involution, that is to say; here, in the bowels of the volcano, theElements of air, fire, water and earth are intermingled and transformed (50).Hence it becomes feasible to relate the volcano to Shiva, the god of creation anddestruction. As a psychological symbol, the volcano represents the passionswhich, according to Beaudoin, become the sole source of our spiritual energy oncewe have managed to master and transform them. An examination of the 30thsymbol of the Ars Symbolica of Bosch in relation to the legendary motto Gelat etardet, points to the conclusion that there is a profound significance of the volcanotouching upon the coincidentia oppositorum. Another important sense of thevolcano arises from its peculiar characteristic whereby a long period of latent,enclosed and occult labour is followed by a sudden and terrible eruption. Byanalogy between this process and many other similar processes in the lives ofindividuals and social groups, the word ‘volcano’ has come to be used as an imageof this dual tendency of tension and distension (31).Vulcan Vulcan, as a symbol, is related to the smith who has his forge in themountain-cave, and hence to the demiurge.

According to Diel, he bears a family rela-tionship to the Christian devil. His deformity was a consequence of his defianceof Jupiter—the spirit—who punished him by hurling him down from mountOlympus. Diel also suggests that Vulcan, Icarus and Prometheus are symbolic ofthe intellect—understood almost in its technical and ‘merely human’ sense—inopen rebellion against the spirit (15).Vulture In Egyptian hieroglyphs, the sign of the vulture—like the wavy linewhich is the sign for water—stands for the idea of the Mother (19). According toJung, the ‘mother’-symbolism of the Egyptian vulture is probably derived fromits necrophagous habits (31). It was believed that the vulture, because it fed uponcorpses, was related to Mother Nature (and to death). The Parsees place theirdead in specially built towers so that vultures will consume them, believing thatthis facilitates rebirth (56). A sublimation of this meaning—mythic rather thansymbolic in nature—is found in India, where the vulture is the symbol of thetutelary spirits which watch over the individual in lieu of the parents, denotingabnegation and spiritual counsel (38).WWall Its significance is diverse, depending upon which of its different char-acteristics is taken as fundamental. In the Egyptian system of hieroglyphs, thewall is a determinative sign conveying the idea of ‘rising above the common level’(19); clearly the predominant sense here is that of its height. A wall enclosing aspace is the ‘wall of lamentations’, symbolic of the sensation of the world as a‘cavern’—of the doctrine of immanentism or the metaphysical notion of theimpossibility of reaching the outside. It expresses the ideas of impotence, delay,resistance, or a limiting situation. Now, the wall seen from within as an enclosurehas a secondary implication of protection which, according to its function and theattitude of the individual, may even be taken as its principal meaning. Psychoana-lysts frequently regard it in this light and hence have classified it as a mother-symbol, comparable with the town and the house or home (56). Bayley sums up"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"WA R363the two essential features of the wall as follows: Like the house, it is a mysticsymbol representing the feminine element of mankind. This enables us to under-stand the (otherwise absurd) assertion of the Shulamite in the Song of Songs: ‘Iam a wall’. At the same time, this image has another term of comparison, that ofmatter as opposed to spirit (4). It should be noted that the symbolism in the lattercase remains unchanged, since matter corresponds to the passive or feminineprinciple, and spirit to the active or masculine.Wallowing Rolling on the ground, and especially wallowing in mud orswamp, form part of primitive therapy all over the world. The custom alsofigures in some rites involving rain or fertility, and is also to be found in magicpractices where a man is required to roll on the ground in order to rise up againtransformed into a wolf (51). The myth of Antaeus is connected with this belief.In all this, the supposition is that contact with the earth instigates certain latentpossibilities either in the cosmos or in the individual or his spirit. The desire to becured, or for metamorphosis or rain, corresponds to the general longing for ‘Inver-sion’—the upsetting of a given order so that it may be replaced by its opposite.To roll on the ground is, then, one of those sacrificial acts that are supposed toencourage or facilitate inversion, a change in circumstances or in the broad streamof life.Wand, Magic Alongside the ‘technical’ symbolism implied by its material orits colour, its significance derives from the magic power attributed to it, which inturn derives from the concept of every stick or wand as a straight line, embodyingimplications of direction and intensity. Derived, or related, forms are the royalsceptre, the marshal’s baton, the battle-club, the mayor’s staff and the conductor’sbaton (48).Wandering Jew The legend of Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew, is believed tobe of Western origin. Underlying it is the symbolic idea of the man who cannotdie, or who, after his apparent death (King don Rodrigo, or don Sebastian, or KingArthur, for example) appears again. The tradition can be related also to that of theEternal Youth—the oriental Jadir. In Jung’s opinion they are but one symbolalluding to the imperishable side of Man, such as in the myth of the Dioscuri orthe Gemini (31).War In a cosmic sense, every war concerns the struggle of light againstdarkness—of good against evil. In mythology, there are copious examples of suchstruggles between the powers of light and the forces of darkness: Jupiter’s com-bat with the Titans, Thor versus the giants, Gilgamesh and other heroes versusmonsters (4). The particular field of action is symbolic of the plane of reality onwhich the action takes place. In Islamic tradition, material war is merely the ‘little"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"WARRIORS364holy war’, whereas the ‘great Holy War’ is that which liberates man from theenemies within. The more just the war, the more faithful the image of it. Guénonspecifically states that the only justification for war is the reducing of multiplic-ity to unity—disorder to order. In this way, war can be seen as the means ofreinstating the original order, or as a kind of ‘sacrifice’ which echoes the cosmog-onic sacrifice. Exactly the same applies to the psychic plane: Man must seek toachieve inner unity in his actions, in his thoughts, and also between his actionsand his thoughts. Unity of purpose is symbolized by ritual orientation, in whichthe terrestrial ‘centres’ (the North star, or the East) become visual images of theone true ‘Centre’ (25).Warriors They symbolize forebears, or the latent forces within the person-ality ready to come to the aid of the consciousness. If the warriors are hostile,then they signify antagonistic forces, but still within the framework of the per-sonality. This symbolism is similar to that of the four archers who defend thecardinal points; the ‘spaces’ rendered independent of the ‘centre’ are illustrationsof the forces which may rise up, as it were, against the integrity of the individual.Defenders and attackers then become, respectively, forces for and against thepersonality.Water In Egyptian hieroglyphs, the symbol for water is a wavy line withsmall sharp crests, representing the water’s surface. The same sign, when tripled,symbolizes a volume of water, that is, the primaeval ocean and prime matter.According to hermetic tradition, the god Nu was the substance from which thegods of the first ennead emerged (19). The Chinese consider water as the specificabode of the dragon, because all life comes from the waters (13). In the Vedas,water is referred to as mâtritamâh (the most maternal) because, in the beginning,everything was like a sea without light. In India, this element is generally regardedas the preserver of life, circulating throughout the whole of nature, in the form ofrain, sap, milk and blood. Limitless and immortal, the waters are the beginning andthe end of all things on earth (60). Although water is, in appearance, formless,ancient cultures made a distinction between ‘upper waters’ and ‘lower waters’.The former correspond to the potential or what is still possible, the latter to whatis actual or already created (26). In a general sense, the concept of ‘water’ stands,of course, for all liquid matter. Moreover, the primaeval waters, the image ofprime matter, also contained all solid bodies before they acquired form and rigid-ity. For this reason, the alchemists gave the name of ‘water’ to quicksilver in itsfirst stage of transmutation and, by analogy, also to the ‘fluid body’ of Man (57).This ‘fluid body’ is interpreted by modern psychology as a symbol of the uncon-scious, that is, of the non-formal, dynamic, motivating, female side of the person-"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"WAT E R365ality. The projection of the mother-imago into the waters endows them withvarious numinous properties characteristic of the mother (31). A secondary mean-ing of this symbolism is found in the identification of water with intuitive wis-dom. In the cosmogony of the Mesopotamian peoples, the abyss of water wasregarded as a symbol of the unfathomable, impersonal Wisdom. An ancient Irishgod was called Domnu, which means ‘marine depth’. In prehistoric times theword for abyss seems to have been used exclusively to denote that which wasunfathomable and mysterious (4). The waters, in short, symbolize the universalcongress of potentialities, the fons et origo, which precedes all form and allcreation. Immersion in water signifies a return to the preformal state, with a senseof death and annihilation on the one hand, but of rebirth and regeneration on theother, since immersion intensifies the life-force. The symbolism of baptism,which is closely linked to that of water, has been expounded by St. JohnChrysostom (Homil. in Joh., XXV, 2): ‘It represents death and interment, life andresurrection. . . . When we plunge our head beneath water, as in a sepulchre, theold man becomes completely immersed and buried. When we leave the water, thenew man suddenly appears’ (18). The ambiguity of this quotation is only on thesurface: in this particular aspect of the general symbolism of water, death affectsonly Man-in-nature while the rebirth is that of spiritual man. On the cosmic level,the equivalent of immersion is the flood, which causes all forms to dissolve andreturn to a fluid state, thus liberating the elements which will later be recombinedin new cosmic patterns. The qualities of transparency and depth, often associ-ated with water, go far towards explaining the veneration of the ancients for thiselement which, like earth, was a female principle. The Babylonians called it ‘thehome of wisdom’. Oannes, the mythical being who brings culture to mankind, isportrayed as half man and half fish (17). Moreover, in dreams, birth is usuallyexpressed through water-imagery (v. Freud, Introduction to Psycho-Analysis).The expressions ‘risen from the waves’ and ‘saved from the waters’ symbolizefertility, and are metaphorical images of childbirth. On the other hand, water is, ofall the elements, the most clearly transitional, between fire and air (the etherealelements) and earth (the solid element). By analogy, water stands as a mediatorbetween life and death, with a two-way positive and negative flow of creation anddestruction. The Charon and Ophelia myths symbolize the last voyage. Deathwas the first mariner. ‘Transparent depth’, apart from other meanings, stands inparticular for the communicating link between the surface and the abyss. It cantherefore be said that water conjoins these two images (2). Gaston Bachelardpoints to many different characteristics of water, and derives from them manysecondary symbolic meanings which enrich the fundamental meaning we have"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"WAT E R366described. These secondary meanings are not so much a set of strict symbols, asa kind of language expressing the transmutations of this ever-flowing element.Bachelard enumerates clear water, spring water, running water, stagnant water,dead water, fresh and salt water, reflecting water, purifying water, deep water,stormy water. Whether we take water as a symbol of the collective or of thepersonal unconscious, or else as an element of mediation and dissolution, it isobvious that this symbolism is an expression of the vital potential of the psyche,of the struggles of the psychic depths to find a way of formulating a clear messagecomprehensible to the consciousness. On the other hand, secondary symbolismsare derived from associated objects such as water-containers, and also from theways in which water is used: ablutions, baths, holy water, etc. There is also avery important spatial symbolism connected with the ‘level’ of the waters, de-noting a correlation between actual physical level and absolute moral level. It isfor this reason that the Buddha, in his Assapuram sermon, was able to regard themountain-lake—whose transparent waters reveal, at the bottom, sand, shells,snails and fishes—as the path of redemption. This lake obviously corresponds toa fundamental aspect of the ‘Upper Waters’. Clouds are another aspect of the‘Upper Waters’. In Le Transformationi of Ludovico Dolce, we find a mysticfigure looking into the unruffled surface of a pond, in contrast with the accursedhunter, always in restless pursuit of his prey, implying the symbolic contrastbetween contemplative activity—the sattva state of Yoga—and blind outwardactivity—the rajas state. Finally, the upper and lower waters communicate re-ciprocally through the process of rain (involution) and evaporation (evolution).Here, fire intervenes to modify water: the sun (spirit) causes sea water to evapo-rate (i.e. it sublimates life). Water is condensed in clouds and returns to earth inthe form of life-giving rain, which is invested with twofold virtues: it is water, andit comes from heaven (15). Lao-Tse paid considerable attention to this cyclicprocess of meteorology, which is at one and the same time physical and spiritual,observing that: ‘Water never rests, neither by day nor by night. When flowingabove, it causes rain and dew. When flowing below, it forms streams and rivers.Water is outstanding in doing good. If a dam is raised against it, it stops. If way ismade for it, it flows along that path. Hence it is said that it does not struggle. Andyet it has no equal in destroying that which is strong and hard’ (13). When waterstands revealed in its destructive aspects, in the course of cataclysmic events, itssymbolism does not change, but is merely subordinated to the dominant symbol-ism of the storm. Similarly, in those contexts where the flowing nature of water isemphasized, as in the contention of Heraclitus that ‘You cannot step twice intothe same river; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.’ Here the reference"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"WEAPONS367is not to water-symbolism as such, but to the idea of the irreversible flow along agiven path. To quote Evola, in La tradizione ermetica: ‘Without divine water,nothing exists, according to Zosimus. On the other hand, among the symbols ofthe female principle are included those which figure as origins of the waters(mother, life), such as: Mother Earth, Mother of the Waters, Stone, Cave, Houseof the Mother, Night, House of Depth, House of Force, House of Wisdom,Forest, etc. One should not be misled by the word “divine”. Water symbolizesterrestrial and natural life, never metaphysical life.’Water-Maidens These are mythic beings in Hispanic folklore, diminutivefigures with a star in their forehead, shimmering, straw-coloured bodies and goldenlocks. On the fingers of their right hand they wear white rings and on the left wrista gold band with black stripes. Legend has it that yellow flowers spring up in theirfootprints, bringing happiness to the person who finds them (10). These endear-ing creatures exactly illustrate the functioning of symbolic mechanism: the antith-esis of black and white reflects the theme of symbolic inversion; and gold is anemblem of power. In short, these water-maidens are endowed with the power tostir up and invert the order of things, bringing happiness to the wretched—that is,to everyone.Waves There is a Chinese tradition that the waves are the abode of dragons,and that they are also symbolic of purity (5). The apparent contradiction herearises from the fact that the ocean swell offers two different aspects: because oftheir rhythmic undulations they are reminiscent of dragons, and by virtue of theirwhite foam they suggest purity. There is thus no question of dual tendencieshere—only juxtaposition.Weapons Within the general symbolism of the hero’s struggle, his weaponsare, in a way, the counterpart of the monsters he has to fight. Just as there aredifferent kinds of monsters, so there are different kinds of weapons. Hence, theweapon used in mythic combat has a deep and specific significance: it definesboth the hero and the enemy whom he is trying to destroy. Since, in a purelypsychological interpretation of the symbol, the enemy is simply the forces threat-ening the hero from within, the weapon becomes a genuine representation of astate of conflict. (The wings of Icarus, the sword of Perseus, the club of Hercules,the staff of Oedipus, Neptune’s trident, Hades and Satan) (15). Jung summarizesthis by saying that ‘weapons are an expression of the will directed towards acertain end’ (56). Paul, giving advice on how the Christian should meet the enemy,says, in the Epistle to the Ephesians (vi, 10-17): ‘Finally, my brethren, be strongin the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, thatye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"WEAPONS368flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers ofthe darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Whereforetake unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in theevil day, and, having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girtabout with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; and your feetshod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield offaith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. Andtake the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word ofGod’ (46). According to St. Ephraem, the allegorical interpretation of Paul’ssymbolism is as follows: the helmet—hope; the girding of the loins—charity;shoes—humility; the shield—cross; the bow—prayer; the sword—the word ofGod (46). Diel’s interpretation of the symbolism of weapons also stresses theirmoral significance; he observes that, with ‘the weapons lent by the deity’—it willbe recalled that in myths, mediaeval legends and folklore weapons are oftenmiraculously given to the hero—man must struggle against the urge of his irratio-nal desires, against the beguiling monster, thus serving the higher aims of the spiritand of the species. Arms therefore symbolize the powers and functions of subli-mation and spiritualization, in contrast to monsters, which stand for the baserforces (15). This is why myths and legends stress the almost autonomous powerof the weapons, attributes and objects belonging to heroes, saints and demigods,such as Roland’s oliphant, Thor’s hammer and the rod of Moses (4). In additionto this general significance, the symbolism of some arms is enriched by theassociations of the Element to which they pertain. Thus, the bolas of SouthAmerican Indians and gauchos, and the sling, have associations with the air; thespear, with earth; the sword, with fire; the trident, with the watery deeps (41).Further connotations follow on from certain groupings of arms in connexion withstatus or character: the sceptre, the mace, the staff and the whip are attributes ofroyalty; the spear, the dagger and the sword are the weapons of the knight; theknife and the poniard are secret weapons and, to a certain extent, base; thethunderbolt and the net are the arms of the Uranian gods, and so on. A comparisonbetween the different symbolic grades of arms and the Jungian archetypes wouldgive the following correlations: Shadow (knife, dagger), Anima (spear), Mana(mace or club, net, whip), Self (sword). On the basis of this correlation, Schneiderstates (50) that the combat of spear against sword is that of earth against heaven.On the other hand, a further specific meaning pertains to the sword as the ‘weaponof salvation’, in connexion with medicinal rites (51) and with ceremonies more"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"WEST369exalted in implication. Crushing weapons, such as the club, stand for destructionrather than victory (15).Weaving The act of weaving represents, basically, creation and life, andparticularly the latter in so far as it denotes accumulation and multiplication orgrowth. In this sense it was known, and put to magic and religious use, in Egyptand the pre-Columbian cultures of Peru (40). Beigbeder recalls that weaving wasan attribute of the Parcae, and also of the Virgin in Byzantine iconography. Theweaving symbol is universal, and of prehistoric origin.Week The pattern of the week is related to that of the seven Directions ofSpace: two days are associated with each of the three dimensions, while thecentre, as the ‘unvarying mean’ or the image of the Aristotelian ‘unmoved mover’,corresponds to the day of rest. The fact that this space-time prototype, foundedupon the number seven, embraced also the planetary spheres and the principaldeities of each pantheon, can be seen in the way each of the planets (including thesun and the moon) gave its name to one of the weekdays. As a consequence of thisinfluence of the planetary gods (comparable in their negative aspect with theseven deadly sins), the seven-headed monster of myth, legend and folklore alsorefers to the dangers of temptation growing day by day as the week progresses.Well In Christian symbolism the well falls within the group of ideas associ-ated with the concept of life as a pilgrimage, and signifies salvation (4). The wellof refreshing and purifying water is symbolic of sublime aspirations, or of the‘silver cord’ which attaches man to the function of the Centre. Demeter and otherdeities were shown standing beside a well (15). But this symbol is found not onlyin the higher cultures of Antiquity but also among the primitives. Schneider hasnoted that, in the medicinal rites of peoples at the animistic level, the centre of thescene is taken up by a lake or well in whose water the sick wash their hands,breast and head. At the water’s edge, reeds grow and shells are to be found, andboth are signs of the waters of salvation (51). In particular, the act of drawingwater from a well is—like fishing—symbolic of drawing out and upwards thenuminous contents of the deeps (31). To look into the waters of a lake or well istantamount to the mystic attitude of contemplation. Finally, the well is also asymbol of the soul, and an attribute of things feminine (32).West For the Egyptians and the Greeks, the West—where the sun sets—iswhere the kingdom of the spirits is to be. St. Jerome sites the devil here. The Eastsymbolizes the kingdom of Christ and the West the kingdom of the devil (thedeath of the sun). In the High Middle Ages, the Nordic peoples located thepoisoned sea of destruction and the abyss in the West."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"WETNESS370Wetness Although its value may be positive on the plane of natural life, it hasan entirely negative effect on spiritual life. Dryness and heat correspond to thepredominance of fire, the active element; but wetness corresponds to that ofwater, the element of passivity and dissolution.Whale Symbolic of the world, the body and the grave (20), and also regardedas an essential symbol of containing (and concealing). Rabanus Maurus (Operum,III, Allegoriae in Sacram Scripturam) lays particular stress on this aspect (46).Nowadays, however, the whale seems to have acquired more independence as asymbolic equivalent of the mystic mandorla, or the area of intersection of thecircles of heaven and earth, comprising and embracing the opposites of existence(51).Wheel This is a symbol, wide in scope, much used in the ornamental arts andin architecture, complex and enclosing several layers of meaning. Some of thedisagreement about its symbolic sense may be due to confusion of the disk(which is immobile) with the wheel (which rotates). There is, however, no objec-tion to the fusion of the two symbols with a view to reconciling the two ideas ofthe disk and the wheel. One of the elementary forms of wheel-symbolism con-sists of the sun as a wheel, and of ornamental wheels as solar emblems (14). AsKrappe has pointed out, the concept of the sun as a wheel was one of the mostwidespread notions of antiquity. The idea of the sun as a two-wheeled chariot isonly at one remove from this. These same ideas can be found among the Aryansand also among the Semites (35). Given the symbolic significance of the sun as asource of light (standing for intelligence) and of spiritual illumination, it is easy tounderstand why the Buddhist doctrine of the solar wheel has been so widelyadmired (31). ‘Catherine-wheels’, and the ‘wheel of fire’ rolled down the hillsidein popular festivals of the summer-solstice; and the mediaeval processions inwhich wheels were mounted on boats or carts, as well as the torture-on-the-wheel; and such traditions as the ‘Wheel of Fortune’ or the ‘Wheel of the Year’, allpoint to a deeply rooted solar or zodiacal symbolism. The function of the wheel-of-fire was, in essence, to ‘stimulate’ the sun in its activity and to ward off winterand death (17). It is, therefore, a symbolic synthesis of the activity of cosmicforces and the passage of time (57). There is, it must be admitted, a discrepancybetween the interpretation of those who see the wheel particularly as a solarsymbol, and those who relate it to the symbolism of the pole (although basicallyboth allude to the mystery of the rotational tendency of all cyclic processes). Theswastika, being an intermediate sign between the cross and the wheel, is similarlyregarded by some as a solar and by others as a polar sign. Guénon tends towardsthe latter hypothesis (28). But, in any case, the allusion is, in the last resort, to the"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"WHEEL371splitting up of the world-order into two essentially different factors: rotarymovement and immobility—or the perimeter of the wheel and its still centre, animage of the Aristotelian ‘unmoved mover’. This becomes an obsessive theme inmythic thinking, and in alchemy it takes the form of the contrast between thevolatile (moving and therefore transitory) and the fixed. The dual structure of thewheel is usually indicated by characteristic patterns which tend to confine geo-metric ornamentation—either stylized or figurative—to the periphery, while theround, empty space in the middle is either left vacant, or a single symbol isinscribed therein—a triangle, for instance, or a sacred figure. Guénon notes thatthe Celtic wheel-symbol persisted into the Middle Ages, and adds that the orna-mental oculi of Romanesque churches and the rose-windows of Gothic architec-ture are versions of this wheel. He also shows that there is an indubitable connexionbetween the wheel and such emblematic flowers as the rose (in the West) and thelotus (in the East) (28)—in other words, figures patterned after the mandala. Therim of the wheel is divided into sectors illustrating phases in the passage of time.In alchemy, there are numerous symbolic representations of the wheel, denotingthe circulatory process: the ascending period is shown on one side, the descend-ing on the other. These alchemic stages are also represented as birds soaringheavenwards or swooping down to earth, denoting sublimation and condensa-tion, in turn corresponding to evolution and involution, or spiritual progress andregression (32). The ‘Wheel of Law, Truth and Life’ is one of the eight emblemsof good luck in Chinese Buddhism. It illustrates the way of escape from theillusory world (of rotation) and from illusions, and the way towards the ‘Centre’(5). The wheel which is divided up into sectors by radii drawn from its outerperimeter to the circumference of an inner circle, is a graphic symbol sometimesseen in water-marks of mediaeval times over a plant-stem located between thehorns of an ox (symbolizing sacrifice); Bayley opines that this wheel representsthe ‘communion of saints’, or the reunion of the faithful in the mystic Centre (4).René Guénon says, in relation to Taoist doctrine, that the chosen one, the sage,invisible at the centre of the wheel, moves it without himself participating in themovement and without having to bestir himself in any way. He quotes, amongothers, the following Taoist passages: ‘The sage is he who has attained the centralpoint of the Wheel and remains bound to the “Unvarying Mean”, in indissolubleunion with the Origin, partaking of its immutability and imitating its non-actingactivity’; ‘He who has reached the highest degree of emptiness, will be secure inrepose. To return to the root is to enter into the state of repose’, that is, to throwoff the bonds of things transitory and contingent (25)."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"WHEEL OF FORTUNE, THE372Wheel of Fortune, The The tenth enigma of the Tarot pack. It is an allegorywhich turns upon the general symbolism of the wheel. Based upon the symbol-ism of the number two, it expresses the equilibrium of the contrary forces ofcontraction and expansion—the principle of polarity. The wheel is set in motionby a handle—fateful because it is irreversible—and it is floating on a figurativerepresentation of the ocean of chaos, supported by the masts of two boats whichare joined one to the other; in each boat there is a snake, symbolizing the twoprinciples of the active and the passive. The ascending half of this wheel has aneffigy of Hermanubis and his caduceus, while the descending portion displays aTyphon-like monster with its trident; the two halves symbolize respectively theconstructive and destructive forces of existence, the first figure being related tothe constellation of Canis, and the second to Capricorn (denoting, within thesymbolism of the Zodiac, the principle of dissolution initiated in Pisces). Abovethe wheel, this allegorical card has a motionless sphinx, alluding to the mystery ofall things and the intermingling of the disparate (59).Whip The symbolism of the whip is a mixture of that of the knot or bow andthat of the sceptre, both of them signs for domination, mastery and superiority.It expresses the idea of punishment, like the truncheon and the club—counterbal-anced by the sword as a symbol of purification—and also the power to encircleand overwhelm (51). In Egypt, the lash, because of its morphological associationwith lightning, was the attribute of Min, the god of the wind, and, in general, ofcertain deities reigning over storms (41). The Dioscuri carried whips; and bronzewhips figured in the cult of Zeus in Dodona (35). The Egyptian Pharaohs usedthe whip as an emblem of power. The Romans used to hang their whips in theirtriumphal chariots (8). Logically, the whip ought also to be related to rites offlagellation (or fecundity) (8). It is, furthermore, an attribute of the ‘TerribleMother’ (31).Whirlwind Characterized by spiral or helicoid movement, this symbolexpresses the dynamism of the three-dimensional cross—that is, of space itself.It is, therefore, symbolic of universal evolution.Whistling Whistling is, to follow Jung, like clacking the tongue in so far asboth are archaic ways of calling to and attracting the attention of theriomorphicdeities—or totemic or deified animals (31). This explains the social taboo uponwhistling.Wild Man The image of the Wild Man or savage, covered only with a loin-cloth, or a garment of leaves or skins, is a common one in the folklore of almostevery country. It is related to, but not identical with, such mythic beings as the‘snowman’, the ogre, giants, etc. In heraldry, the image takes the form of the"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"WINDOW373supporter of an escutcheon, when its significance becomes analogous to that ofthe animals that normally fulfil this function—that is, they express, by virtue oftheir bilateral symmetry, the counterbalancing of base forces, while sustainingcertain spiritual and sublimating elements (the heraldic symbols themselves).Sometimes one finds Wild Women of similar aspect and similar significance.Frazer has described some folklore customs which are unquestionably related tothis fabulous woman. Some regions of Germany, during Whitsuntide, hold afestival called ‘the Expulsion of the Wild Man’, in which the part of the savage isplayed by a youth, covered in leaves and moss, who hides in the woods. Theothers then begin a chase which ends with his figurative death. Next day theymake a stretcher and place on it a straw puppet resembling the Wild Man. Thisthey carry in procession to a lake where the executioner throws it into the water(21). In Bohemia, the ‘king’ makes his appearance clothed in grass and flowers.The Wild Man seems to coincide with the ‘Scapegoat’ in the ritual assassinationof the king. Jung suggests that this myth symbolizes the primitive or baser partof the personality, or the unconscious in its perilous and regressive aspect, whichhe has termed the ‘shadow’ (56). It is also connected with fabulous islands suchas the island of St. Brendan or the land of Prester John.Wind The wind is air in its active and violent aspects, and is held to be theprimary Element by virtue of its connexion with the creative breath or exhalation.Jung recalls that in Arabic (and paralleled by the Hebrew) the word ruh signifiesboth ‘breath’ and ‘spirit’ (31). At the height of its activity, the wind gives rise tothe hurricane (a synthesis and ‘conjunction’ of the four Elements), which iscredited with the power of fecundation and regeneration. It was taken up in thissense by the alchemists, as can be seen for example in Jamsthaler’s ViatoriumSpagyricum (Frankfort, 1625) (31). The winds were numbered and brought intocorrespondence with the cardinal points and the signs of the Zodiac, so as to bringout their cosmic significance. In Egypt and Greece the wind was reckoned topossess certain evil powers; but for the Greeks, this menacing implication, whichthey associated with Typhon, was reversed from that moment when the fleet ofXerxes was destroyed by a tempest (41).Window Since it consists of an aperture, the window expresses the ideas ofpenetration, of possibility and of distance, and because it is square in shape, itsimplications are rational and terrestrial. It is also symbolic of consciousness (32),especially when it is located at the top of a tower, by analogy with the head of thehuman figure. Divided windows carry a secondary significance, which may attimes even be the predominant sense, deriving from the number of openings or"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"WINE374lights and from the inter-relationships between the relevant number-symbolismand the general symbolism of the window (Plate XXXI).Wine An ambivalent symbol like the god Dionysos himself. On the one handwine, and red wine in particular, symbolizes blood and sacrifice; on the other, itsignifies youth and eternal life, like that divine intoxication of the soul hymned byGreek and Persian poets which enables man to partake, for a fleeting moment, ofthe mode of being attributed to the gods (17).Wine-skin An attribute of the satyr and of Silenus. In Greek, the phrase ‘tountie the wine-skin’ meant to indulge in Venusian delights (8). The phrase itself issuggestive of the lingam in the conjunction of a masculine, phallic element (thefeet of the goat) and a feminine element (the skin as a receptacle). This idea wastaken up by Christians who linked it with the idea of sin, and the wine-skinthereby came to symbolize evil-mindedness or a heavy conscience. Pinedo haspointed out that the wine-skin carried by various figures in Romanesque de-signs—such as that on the Porta Speciosa of the sanctuary at Estibaliz—bearsprecisely this meaning, and he quotes the Psalms in support: ‘He gathereth thewaters of the sea together as in a wine-skin(1): he layeth up the depth in store-houses’ (Psalms xxxiii, 7) (46). Analogous in significance are the haversack, theshepherd’s pouch, and also the horn-pipe and the bladder of the buffoon (though,because of his sacrificial character, the buffoon alludes to the sins of others).Wings In the more general sense, wings symbolize spirituality, imagination,thought. The Greeks portrayed love and victory as winged figures, and somedeities, such as Athena, Artemis and Aphrodite were at first—though not later—also depicted with wings. According to Plato, wings are a symbol of intelligence,which is why some fabulous animals are winged, depicting the sublimation ofthose symbolic qualities usually ascribed to each animal. Pelops’ horses, andPegasus, as well as Ceres’ snakes, have this attribute. Wings are also found oncertain objects such as heroes’ helmets, the caduceus and the thunderbolt in thecult of Jupiter (8). It follows that the form and nature of the wings express thespiritual qualities of the symbol. Thus, the wings of night-animals express aperverted imagination, and Icarus’ wax wings stand for functional insufficiency(15). In Christian symbolism it is said that wings are simply the light of the sunof justice, which always illuminates the mind of the righteous. Since wings alsosignify mobility, this meaning combines with that of enlightenment to express thepossibility of ‘progress in enlightenment’ or spiritual evolution (46). In alchemy,wings are always associated with the higher, active, male principle; animals with-1The English Authorised version reads: ‘He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap. . .’ The Septuagint gives ‘wine-skin’.—Translator."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"WOMAN375out wings are related to the passive female principle (33). It should also berecalled that, since the foot is regarded as a symbol of the soul (15), the wings onthe heels of some deities, especially Mercury, stand for the power of spiritualelevation comparable in essence with cosmic evolution. Jules Duhem, in histhesis on the history of flight, remarks that, in Tibet, ‘Buddhist saints travelthrough the air wearing a special kind of shoes known as “light feet” ‘(3).Withdrawal Every withdrawal, retreat or concealment—like the moon andlike sleep—symbolizes that period of life before and after its involution as mat-ter, that is, before and after the manifest life of appearances.Wolf Symbolic of valour among the Romans and the Egyptians. It alsoappears as a guardian in a great many monuments (8). In Nordic mythology weare told of a monstrous wolf, Fenris, that would destroy iron chains and shacklesand was eventually shut up in the bowels of the earth. It was also said that, withthe twilight of the gods—the end of the world—the monster would break out ofthis prison too, and would devour the sun. Here, then, the wolf appears as asymbol of the principle of evil, within a pattern of ideas which is unquestionablyrelated to the Gnostic cosmogony. Nordic mythology presupposes that cosmicorder is possible only through the temporary shackling of the chaotic and de-structive potential of the universe—a potential which (through the process ofSymbolic Inversion—q.v.) must triumph in the end. The myth is also connectedwith all other concepts of the final annihilation of the world, whether by water orby fire.Woman In anthropology, woman corresponds to the passive principle ofnature. She has three basic aspects: first, as a siren, lamia or monstrous being whoenchants, diverts and entices men away from the path of evolution; second, as themother, or Magna mater (the motherland, the city or mother-nature) related inturn to the formless aspect of the waters and of the unconscious; and third, as theunknown damsel, the beloved or the anima in Jungian psychology. In his Symbolsof Transformation, Jung maintains that the ancients saw Woman as either Eve,Helen, Sophia or Mary (corresponding to the impulsive, the emotional, the intel-lectual, and the moral) (33). One of the purest and all-embracing archetypes ofWoman as anima is Beatrice in Dante’s Commedia (32). All allegories based uponthe personification of Woman invariably retain all the implications of the threebasic aspects mentioned above. Of great interest are those symbols in which theWoman appears in association with the figure of an animal—for example, theswan-woman in Celtic and Germanic mythology, related to the woman with thehoof of a goat in Hispanic folklore. In both cases the woman disappears once hermaternal mission has been completed and, similarly, the virgin qua virgin ‘dies’ in"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"WOMAN, DEAD376order to give way to the matron (31). In iconography it is common to find partsof the female figure combined with that of a lion. The Egyptian goddess Sekhmet,characterized by her destructiveness, had the body of a woman and the head (andtherefore the mind) of a lion. Conversely, a figure with a lion’s body and awoman’s head appears in the Hieroglyphica of Valeriano as an emblem of thehetaira (39). The inclusion of feminine, morphological elements in the composi-tion of traditional symbols such as the sphinx always alludes to a background ofnature overlaid with the projection of a concept or of an entire complex of cosmicintuitions. In consequence, the Woman is an archetypal image of great complexityin which the decisive factor may be the superimposed symbolic aspects—forexample, the superior aspects of Woman as Sophia or Mary determine her func-tion as a personification of science or of supreme virtue; and when presented asan image of the anima, she is superior to the man because she is a reflection of theloftiest and purest qualities of the man. In her baser forms as Eve or as Helen—the instinctive and emotional aspects—Woman is on a lower level than the man.It is here, perhaps, that she appears at her most characteristic—a temptress, theEwig Weibliche, who drags everything down with her, and a symbol comparablewith the volatile principle in alchemy, signifying all that is transitory, inconsis-tent, unfaithful and dissembling. See also The Loved One and Sophia.Woman, Dead The image, vision or dream of a dead young woman in hertomb, is a direct symbol of the death of the anima. The French legend of QueenBlanche, quoted by Gérard de Sède in Les Templiers sont parmi nous (Paris,1962), tells of this. Sède, in this context, links the names of Isis, a legendary Yseof the Knights Templars, and Yseult or Isolde. Georg Gichtel, a disciple of JakobBöhme, refers to this symbol of the dead maiden or queen (dead in fact or inappearance, that is to say, sleeping, as in the well-known fairy tale) as one thatrelates ‘to the corruption of the shining Paradisiac body’ (cf. Evola, La Tradizioneermetica, Bari, 1948).Wood A mother-symbol (31). Burnt wood signifies wisdom and death (50).The magic and fertilizing propensities of the wood burnt in sacrificial rites aresupposed to be transmitted to the ashes and the charcoal. Cremation is regardedas a return to the ‘seed’-state; this has given rise to many rites and folklorecustoms, related in turn to fire-symbolism (17).World Symbolically, the world is the realm in which a state of existence isunfolded (25), comprising many component parts adhering together. Used in theplural, the term pertains, in a sense, to space-symbolism, but the ‘worlds’ arereally only different modes of the spirit (26). The explanation of the cosmic andmoral significance of the three worlds (the infernal, the terrestrial and the celes-"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"WORLD-IMAGE377tial) is to be sought in the symbolism of level. The inferior must not always beequated with the subterranean, for, in megalithic cultures, the latter was usuallylocated high up, or in the hollow interior of mountains (conceived as the dwelling-place of the dead). Guénon has pointed out that references to the ‘subterraneanworld’ are found in a large number of cultural traditions, in which the ‘cult of thecavern’ or cave is linked with that of the ‘centre’. One must also bear in mind theequation of the cavern with the cave of the heart, the latter being considered as theCentre of being or the Egg of the World (28).World, The The twenty-first enigma of the Tarot pack. The fact that theseries consists of ternaries and septenaries is further proof that the number 21implies a synthesis, or the totality of the manifest world, that is, the world ofspace as a reflection of permanent creative activity. This idea is represented in theallegorical image of this playing-card by a young girl running with two smallsticks inside a garland which is surrounded by the cosmic quaternary ortetramorphs. The sticks are symbolic of polarization inducing the rotationalmotion of all things in the entire cosmos. According to Wirth, this girl also repre-sents major Fortune, whereas minor Fortune corresponds to the tenth card of theTarot. The quaternary is connected with the Elements, and the garland with thecosmic process (59).World-image The host of possibilities opened up by the very word ‘world’,points to the great number of symbolic images capable of reflecting its multipleaspects. All the great symbols are really images of the world: The septenary, forexample, in the form of candelabra with seven branches, reflecting the arrange-ment of the planets; and bilateral symmetry as, for example, in the caduceus ofMercury, is the image of the world in so far as it is an equilibrium of hostile forces;and all forms of wheel symbols, such as the Zodiac, mandalas, or the Tarot pack,correspond to the world in so far as it appears as a cycle or succession of changes.But the essence of the world is the conflict between time and eternity, matter andspirit, or the conjunction of opposites which yet remain separate on the plane ofexistence—a conflict, that is, between continuity and discontinuity, usually con-veyed by means of images reconciling the square with the circle, sometimessimply by ‘squaring the circle’ as in alchemic practice, and sometimes by multi-plying one of the component elements by four, as in the oriental pentacle of Laos.The arrangement of the tetramorphs as a spiritual quaternary, keeping the centreas an image of the Origin (that is, heaven) which is counterbalanced by the worldof manifestation, is sometimes represented as a city with four towers and fourgates, always with an image of paramount significance in the centre (32). Frobeniusrecounts the history of a group of interesting symbols of this kind bearing upon"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"WORLD SOUL378the ritual cups or chalices of Ethiopia (inspired in the ceramics of Susa) in thefourth millenary before our era. In the middle of these cups there is a cross orsome other symbol either of the swastika or of the damero type; this may be arepresentation of earth, for on the edges there is a motif sketched in, which mightbe an image of water. An African cup from Benin has a sea-serpent in the sameposition; here the symbol may be related to the dragon biting his own tail as in theGnostic Ouroboros. A wooden disc from Morka shows an image of the sun in thecentre, then a double chain suggesting the ocean, and finally an outer coronadivided into four parts to accord with the four cardinal points (corresponding inturn with the seasons and the four Elements). But Frobenius also speaks of three-dimensional images of the world. He relates how, in 1910, he happened to be inthe Yoruba (West Africa), where he made his way to the holy city of Ife, andthere, in a place sacred to the god Ejar, he found an object like a kind of platformwith a cone at each of its four corners and another larger one in the centre,surmounted by a cup or chalice. The central cone is the Mountain of the World(the mystic mandorla); and the four others correspond to the cardinal points. Henotes the relationship between this image and certain thrones with five supports(22). Quite apart from the pictorial images of the Pantokrator and the tetramorphs,which are comparable to the above, Christianity too has an example of the samekind of pattern, depicted three-dimensionally, in the baptismal font at Estibaliz.Pinedo describes it as follows: The base is a heavy column, with four smaller onesclose to it (analogous with the Centre and the four cardinal points); above it, alotus flower is shown opening its corolla (a symbol of the world made manifest,and of nativity). Above this corolla, there is a colonnade with arches on which areinscribed other smaller, trefoiled arches. In the spaces there are diverse symbolicbeings (connoting the plane of cosmic life, that is, of existence). Above the arches,there is a pattern representing the battlements of the celestial Jerusalem—para-dise regained (46). As a symbol of the world, then, in all its fundamental aspects,this image is the most artistic, the most exact and complete known to us.World Soul This concept is related ideologically to that of the Great Motherand to that of the moon as a source of change and transmutation. It has certainnegative characteristics, e.g. a tendency to divide and multiply—which is theessential prerequisite for all creative and reproductive processes (31). Only inliterature is the World Soul a single whole, and it is then equivalent to the ‘mysticvoid’ of Hindu and Hebrew traditions.Worm Jung defines the worm as a libidinal figure which kills instead of givinglife (31). This comes from its underground associations, its base characteristics,its connexion with death and with the biological stages of dissolution and the"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"WOVEN FABRIC379primary. Thus, it is death which the worm symbolizes—but death which isrelative from the point of view of what is superior or organized; basically, like thesnake, it denotes crawling, knotted energy.Woven Fabric The phrase ‘the web of life’ is an eloquent expression of thesymbolism of woven fabric which is not only concerned with ideas of binding andincrease through the blending of two elements (the warp and the woof—thepassive and the active), nor is it merely equivalent to creation; rather does itdenote the mystic apprehension of the world of phenomena as a kind of veilwhich hides the true and the profound from sight. As Porphyry observed: ‘Theancients called the heavens “a veil” because, in a sense, they are the garments ofthe gods.’ And as Plato said: ‘The one and only Demiurge commands the second-ary demiurges’—that is, the mythological gods—’to bind the immortal to themortal in a symbolic fabric’. In addition to the symbolism of weaving, this ideaembraces that of the Gemini (signifying the dual composition of all things inexistence, one part being immortal and the other mortal). Plutarch observed thatweaving was invented by Isis with the assistance of her sister Nephthys (40).The legend of the ‘Web of Penelope’ is related to this. Guénon sees the warp andwoof as equivalent to the horizontal and vertical limbs of the cosmic cross, wherethe upright represents the various states of being and the horizontal the degree ofdevelopment reached by these states. He also mentions that the two lines of theloom can be identified with the masculine and the feminine principles, and thatthis is why, in the Upanishads, the Supreme Brahma is designated ‘He uponwhom the worlds are woven as warp and woof’. At the same time, the alternationof life and death, condensation and dissolution, the predominance of Yang or ofYin, are, for the Taoists, like the alternating ‘waves’ of thread in the weave of thefabric (25). Apart from this essential symbolism, a fabric has further symbolicmeanings deriving from its colour, form and function (where applicable). Piobb,with particular reference to Scotch tartans, has pointed out that certain types offabric are characterized by patterns with an esoteric purport (48). Ornamentaldesigns have the same symbolic significance whether they appear in a fabric, orare engraved on a stone or painted in a miniature (see Graphics). The veil, as anelemental form of weaving and as clothing, is symbolic of ‘wrapping’, that is, ofmatter. The seven veils in Salome’s dance, or in the myth of Ishtar, correspond tothe seven planetary spheres and their respective influences."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"YANG-YIN380YYang-Yin A Chinese symbol of the dual distribution of forces, comprisingthe active or masculine principle (Yang) and the passive or feminine principle(Yin). It takes the form of a circle bisected by a sigmoid line, and the two parts soformed are invested with a dynamic tendency which would be wanting if thedivision were by a diameter. The light half represents the Yang force and the darkhalf denotes Yin; however, each half includes an arc cut out of the middle of theopposing half, to symbolize that every mode must contain within it the germ ofits antithesis. Guénon considers that the Yang-Yin is a helicoidal symbol, that is,that it is a section of the universal whirlwind which brings opposites together andengenders perpetual motion, metamorphosis and continuity in situations charac-terized by contradiction. The entrance to and exit from this movement lie outsidethe movement itself, in the same way that birth and death stand apart from the lifeof the individual in so far as it is conscious and self-determined. The vertical axisthrough the centre of the Yang-Yin constitutes the ‘unvarying mean’ or, in otherwords, the mystic ‘Centre’ where there is no rotation, no restlessness, no im-pulse, nor any suffering of any kind. It corresponds to the central zone of theWheel of Transformations in Hindu symbolism, and the centre or the way out ofthe labyrinth in Egyptian and western symbolism. It is also expressive of the twocounterbalancing tendencies of evolution and involution (25).Year More than a symbol, the year is, as it were, the prototype of all cyclicprocesses (the day, the span of human life, the rise and fall of a culture, the cosmiccycle, etc.). All cycles are composed of an ascending and a descending phase, i.e.evolution and involution; sometimes, cycles are also subdivided into three or,more frequently, four phases (seasons of the year, ages of man). The overalldivision of the cyclic process, however, need not necessarily be symmetrical.Thus, in a cycle composed of twelve units, such as the year (or the wheel of theZodiac), the ascending and descending phases can be taken either as 6 plus 6(symmetrical division) or 8 plus 4 (asymmetrical division). The former is a moregeometrical, the latter a more empirical division. The year is usually representedby the figure of an old man in a circle, with two or three outer rings containingsuch items as: the names of the months, the cycle of work appropriate to eachmonth, the signs of the Zodiac and so on. Often the circle of the year is, in its turn,enclosed in a square the corners of which are occupied by four figures personify-"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"ZODIAC381ing the four seasons. The tapestry of the Creation, in Gerona cathedral, is afamous example. Two interesting points in connexion with the annual cycle are:(i) in Chinese tradition, the cycle is divided into two equal parts, correspondingrespectively to darkness/death, and light/life; (ii) there was a primitive belief thatevery man undergoes a process of regeneration every year, from December toJune, symbolizing death and resurrection (51) (Plate XXXII).Yoke Like the sheaf or bunch, the yoke is a symbol of union and discipline;but by virtue of its association with the ox, it is also symbolic of sacrifice (50).Yoni Like the mandorla, the Yoni is the gateway, or the zone of interpenetra-tion wherein two circles intersect. Indians, in order to ensure regeneration, makean image of the Yoni in gold, and pass through it (21).Youth and Old Man These two figures personify the rising and the settingsun. Another similar idea is that which considers each sun as the offspring of itspredecessor; this provides us with an explanation of the great number of solargods born of other sun-gods (35). In addition to this system of ‘continuousconnexion’, or of circular links, the Old Man is always the father (the master,tradition, contemplation, the celestial sovereign, justice), while the Youth is theson (the governed, subversion, intuition, the hero, boldness). The counterbalanc-ing formula of Youth-Old Man loses its equipoise once the Youth is a mature manand the Old Man decrepit, because the latter then becomes infantile and asexual.ZZenith The zenith is a symbol which can be synonymous with that of thecentral hole in the Chinese heaven known as Pi, as well as with that of the peak ofthe mountain-temple, or the pyramid, or the sacrificial stake, or the pillar of theworld (18). It is the point through which mystics believe their thoughts may passout of space into non-space, out of time into timelessness. Hence, the importanceof the formal likeness of this symbol with that of the hole.Zodiac One of the most widespread of symbols, despite its complexity. Inalmost every land and age its characteristics are the same—the circular form, thetwelve subdivisions with their corre spending signs and their relationship withthe seven planets. The Mesopotamian cultures, Egypt, Judea, Persia, India, Ti-"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"ZONE382bet, China, America, Islam, Greece and Northern Europe—all were acquaintedwith zodiacal symbolism. The name of this circular ‘form’ comes from zoe (life)and diakos (wheel); and the basic element of this ‘wheel of life’ is found in theOuroboros (the snake biting its own tail), symbolizing the Aion (duration). Thegeneral significance of the Zodiac concerns the process by which ‘primordialenergy, once fecundated, passes from the potential to the virtual, from unity tomultiplicity, from spirit to matter, from the non-formal world to the world offorms’, and then returns along the same path (52). This accords with the teachingof oriental ontology, which holds that the life of the universe is split into twoopposing yet complementary phases: involution (or materialization) and evolu-tion (or spiritualization). Applying this belief to the Zodiac, the first six signs(from Aries to Virgo) come to represent involution, while the other six (from Librato Pisces) relate to evolution. This pattern refers not only to the evolution of thecosmos in the broadest sense, but also to specific phases of this process as wellas to any given period in the development of the manifest world as such (forexample, a period in history, the lifetime of a race or of an individual, the periodof the world’s existence, the time taken in carrying out a task) (52). As evidenceof the great antiquity of this symbol, we would point to the zodiacal signs in therock-paintings in the Cueva de Arce (at the Laguna de la Janda, Cadiz), thecelestial maps in the stone-engravings at Eira d’os Mouros (in Galicia), and thesculpting of the cromlech at Alvão (in Portugal), not to speak of the numerousother examples of the same kind of thing: but there is no conclusive evidence ofthe existence of a truly systematic understanding of Zodiacal symbolism beforethe time of king Sargon of Agade (2750 B.C.), who was known to possess a workof astrology containing forecasts of the eclipses of the sun. From the time ofHammurabi (2000 B.C.) man’s study of the heavens began to assume a morescientific character. But the Zodiac, and the characteristic signs as we know themtoday, cannot, in the opinion of Berthelot, be traced back farther than the tablet ofCambyses (6th century B.C.); this, however, does not invalidate the theory thatthe separate elements that contributed to the symbolic pattern of the Zodiac as awhole were of much greater antiquity than this. For example, the mystic twelvefoldvision of the world; and the symbol of the ram associated with the mythic Ramand with the Primitive cult of the sun; and also the Gemini. Marc Saunier hascommented, in connexion with the twelve-part division of the Zodiac, that spread-ing into our solar world from an unknowable unknown, through the twelve lumi-nous doors of the Zodiac, it becomes concentrated into the form of the sunwhence it radiates outwards to the seven planetary spheres which refract itsunity in the gamut of sounds, rhythms and colours (49). As Jung notes, according"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"ZONE383to Manichean belief the demiurge builds a cosmic wheel, related to the rota andthe opus circulatorium of alchemy and identical in that it signifies sublimation(31). It is almost unnecessary to point out that this form of motion, rotation onthe vertical plane—descending and ascending—echoes the Platonic theories ofthe soul’s ‘fall’ into material existence and its need to find salvation by returningalong the same path. The most important and definitive adaptations of the zodia-cal cycle—for other variants arise by analogy—are, first, that which equates thetwelve signs with monthly periods, and the complete cycle with the year (com-mencing with March—with the spring), and, secondly, that corresponding to thegreat cycle (lasting 25,920 years) of the precession of the equinoxes, whereby,every 2160 years, the equinox withdraws by the space of one sign (thirty de-grees). The fact that the figures which make up the zodiacal pattern are mostlyanimals has prompted Schneider to suggest that the constellations may owe theircurious names to an earlier religion of totemistic origin, whose basic features weresubsequently applied to the heavens through the process of catasterism (50).Piobb has observed that the Zodiac, besides being a process, may also be under-stood as a circuit and that its twelve-part division springs from the way in whichthe quantitative becomes qualitative (in vibrations, sounds or colours) and hencethe ecliptic is a zone of energy differing in potential between its entrance (Aries)and its exit (Pisces). He also notes that, if one wishes to grasp the ancient concep-tions, one must regard the Zodiac as a totality comprising twelve ideographswhich, in sum, epitomize the dodecagon (48). It is clear that every twelve-partscheme alludes to the zodiacal pattern. The signs (q.v. under separate headings)are as follows: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagit-tarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces (40). According to Senard, these twelve signsare derived from the four Elements combined with the three modes or gunas(levels) known as sattva, rajas and tamas (corresponding, firstly, to a situation—or level—of superiority or of essence; secondly, to an intermediate or transitionalsituation: and, thirdly, to the level of the inferior and material). But we cannothere go into Senard’s theory of the signs of the Zodiac, beyond noting, briefly, themeanings that he attributes to each of them: Aries he interprets as the urge tocreate and transform: Taurus as undifferentiated magnetism; the Gemini as cre-ative synthesis, or imagination; Cancer as gestation and birth; Leo as individua-tion, will; Virgo as intelligence; Libra as equilibrium; Scorpio as histolysis; Sagit-tarius as coordination and synthesis; Capricorn as ascesis; Aquarius as illumina-tion; and Pisces as mystic fusion (52). Mertens-Stienon founds his study of theZodiac upon an article by the Hindu T. Subba Rao, published in October 1881and translated into French for Le Lotus bleu in 1937, drawing also upon the work"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"ZONE384of Blavatsky and Dupuis (the latter favouring an almost exclusively astronomicalinterpretation of the myths). Mertens Stienon, then, divides the zodiacal signsinto three quaternaries, although in our view a better division would be the inverseof this—four ternaries, forming a triunity for each of the seasons of the year (aswell as for the cardinal points). He supports the view that the Zodiac may serveto symbolize and analyse the phases of each and every cycle, together with theevolutive stages which it embraces. He distinguishes between the astronomicalZodiac (the constellations) and the intellectual Zodiac (symbols), affirming that itwas the constellations that took their names from the symbols. For instance,since, in Egyptian times, so much importance was attached to the symbolic bulland ram, this was why, astronomically speaking, these figures came to mark thevernal equinoxes which, in our era, coincide with Pisces. He shows that theapparent orbit of the sun through the twelve divisions corresponds to twelvedegrees or stages in the action of the active principle upon the passive. Thesestages are denoted in mythology by the avatars of the creator-god—by his meta-morphoses and manifestations. The precise symbolism of each sign springs from:(a) the number it bears in the series of twelve signs: (b) its situation within theseries as a whole; (c) its situation within each of the four ternaries; (d) its sym-bolic figure; (e) the ideas related to this figure; and (f) the concomitant planetarysymbolism. In the symbolism of the Zodiac one can sense the resolve to create, asin the Tarot pack, an all-embracing archetypal pattern—a kind of figurative modelto serve as a comprehensive definition of each and every existential possibility inthe macrocosm and the microcosm. As is the case with other symbolic forms,zodiacal symbolism is the product of the serial intellection of the universe,arising out of the belief that all things occupy positions and situations in space-time which are limited and typical, and implying, not determinism, but belief inthe ‘system of destinies’, that is to say, the theory that certain antecedents mustcause certain consequences and that any given situation must have ramificationsthat are neither replaceable nor arbitrary. Regarding the application of the Zodiacto the cycle of human existence in the concrete sense, there are certain obviousaffinities with symbols pertaining to medicinal rites, as Schneider has shown. It isto Jorge Quintana, and his El gobierno teocrático de Mohenjo-Daro (Ampurias,IV), that we owe our knowledge of an octonary zodiac dating from the proto-Indian period of the third millennium before our era. This zodiac is composed ofthe following signs: edu (the ram), yal (the harp), nand (the crab), amma (themother), tuk (the scales), kani (the dart), kuda (the pitcher) and min (the fish).There are obvious parallels between most of these signs and those of thedodecanarian Zodiac.
