It is obvious he was not Sallustius Crispus (86-34 B.C.), whose tempestuous public career which finally subsided into historical labors hardly qualified him for philosophical endeavors. It is generally assumed that the Sallust with whom we are at present concerned was a N eoplatonic philosopher who flourished in the fourth cen- tury A.D., and prepared his work, On the Gods and the World, for the benefit of the Emperor julian. Taylor, however, con- siders it doubtful, and recommends that the reader should concern himself entirely with the content of the treatise, which he regards as an important contribution to the field of N eoplatonic philosophy. The Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that Sallust belonged to the Theurgic School of Pergamum, an offshoot of the School of Iamblichus. Apparently the Emperor julian also belonged to this School. Because this Emperor, who ruled 361-363 A.D., turned from Christianity to Neoplatonism he is often refer- red to by Christian writers as julian, the Apostate. Those who appreciate the philosophical labors of Mr. Thomas Taylor may be especially interested in the five hymns which he composed and appended to the present volume. They are written in the style of the Orphic hyms and honor the deities Ceres, jupiter, Minerva, Vesta, and Mercury. In the six years following the issue of his Sallust, Taylor was hard at work completing his translation of the Dialogues of Plato which Dr. Sydenham, who began the orig- inal translation, did not live to finish. He was also at work on his mon umen tal translation of the Complete Works of Aristotle in ten volumes. He contributed to several periodi- cals and in 1799, became Assistant Secretary to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Com- merce., but was forced to relinquish this position due to iII health. As a result of his translation of Pausanias, the Descrip-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"tion of Greece, he lost the use of the forefinger of his right hand, which he never regained. Thomas Taylor died on the 1st day of November, 1835. He wrote his own epitaph in the following appropriate lines: \"Health, strength and ease, and manhood's active age, freely I gave to Plato's sacred page. \"With truth's pure joys, with Fame my days were crown'd, Tho' Fortune adverse on my labors frown'd.\" Taylor was a profound mathematician as is indicated by his original work, The Theoretic Arithmetic of the Pythagoreans. He carefully avoided any affectation of scholarship and living as he did in a conservative atmosphere, thick with religious prejudice, he was referred to as \"The Great English Pagan.\" Early in their marriage, he taught his wife the Greek language and used this exten- sively in his home. I have heard that he lived in Grecian fashion, even in matters of food and clothing. The interest in the works of Thomas Taylor has increased through the years, and recently his books are much sought after and are difficult to secure because they were issued in extremely limited editions. The present demand more than justifies the re-issue of this volume. The neglect which Taylor suffered during his lifetime and the obscurity in which his writings have languished for more than 150 years, is due largely to the mystical overtones which ornament all his publications. A new era of philosophical idealism has finally brought lustre to his name. The present publication is a photolithographic facsimile of the original edition, slightly enlarged for the convenience of the reader. Manly P.
