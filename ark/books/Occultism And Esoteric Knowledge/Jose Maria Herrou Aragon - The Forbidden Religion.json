PRIMORDIAL GNOSIS Primordial Gnosis is knowledge, wisdom. That is the meaning of the word Gnosis: knowledge. But we are not just referring to any knowledge here. Gnosis is very special knowledge. It is knowledge that causes a great transformation in those who receive it. Knowledge capable of nothing less than waking up and Spiritually liberating those who acquire it. That is its purpose: to throw light on the status of human beings and to try to wake up man and help him escape from the prison in which he finds himself. That is the reason why this knowledge has been repeatedly under attack throughout the course of history, because it is knowledge considered dangerous for the religious and political authorities who govern mankind from the shadows. For that reason Gnosis has always remained occult. Gnosis is secret knowledge, only accessible to those who deserve to have it. Different religions throughout history have tried to keep man ignorant of this knowledge, of this type of knowledge called Gnosis. Now we will find out why. What I am calling Primordial Gnosis is the pure form of Gnosis. It is always the same and will never change as long as the Spiritual situation in which man finds himself and all that we call “creation” or “world” don’t change. On the few occasions in the past in which Primordial Gnosis was openly exposed, it was not in its pure form but was adapted 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"to the cultural and historical particularities of the time and place. However, Primordial Gnosis has always been behind almost every theological and philosophical system which has been branded heretic, forbidden, persecuted and forced to become occult. By examining this forbidden knowledge it is possible to recover the pieces necessary to reconstruct the whole of that which is Primordial Gnosis. And if that knowledge were to be discovered and written down, it would be a very powerful and disturbing book. It would be the most dangerous text in the world, capable of waking up and liberating those who read and study it. Such a book would be a strange object in this created world, something not fabricated here, but coming from somewhere else, from another world completely different to this one. It would also be capable of surviving flames as well as time. Throughout this book I will try to keep as close as possible to that which was and is Primordial Gnosis, Gnostic knowledge in its pure form. 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"2. MATTER IS EVIL All religions maintain that “matter is good”, “the world is good”, “it was created by God”. And “God is just, God is good and created something good for man”. That is why the bible says “And God said ‘Let there be light’, and there was light. And God saw that light was good”. Primordial Gnosis, which we can from now on just call Gnosis, with capital letters to differentiate it from other false gnosis which has appeared throughout the course of history, maintains the opposite: matter is evil and impure; matter is the prison of the Spirit. This material world is hell. Matter is evil, and if matter is evil it follows that its creator must also be evil. For Gnostics, the material world, this world, was created not by a good or just god but by a creator satan. Matter is something satanic, therefore whoever created it must also be a satanic being. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"3. TIME IS EVIL The bible doesn’t say so but time started with the Big Bang. At the very start of creation when god said “Let there be light”, these four words could not have been spoken if time hadn’t existed. Time was created by the creator god when he created light. The first great explosion and expansion could not have existed without time. Time and space were created together and are thus inseparable. Time is the breath of the creator god. And all his creation, the expansion of the universe, the evolution of species, the gradual development of his plan, could not occur without time. According to the Gnostics, the time-breath of the creator god is as satanic as matter and as satanic as the creator god himself. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"4. THE CREATOR GOD In the first centuries of our era many of the Gnostic sects viewed the creator god not as a good or just being, but as a satanic one. Many of them likened him to satan. Gustavo Adolfo Becquer relates in one of his accounts how the creator god Brahma created worlds, like bubbles, and how he experimented with them, as sometimes they turned out good and sometimes not. The creator god is not a completely perfect god but apparently quite inept. There are worlds which turn out badly and he has to destroy them. There are worlds that turn out better. He tries, practices, creates through trial and error. The bible says “God said: Let there be light. And there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good”. How! Didn’t he know? Didn’t he know it was something good? That is why Gnostics say “we are in the presence of a creator ignorant of the effects of his creation”. Likewise, the creator god always maintains that he is the only one. He doesn’t just say it once, he says it all the time, he is constantly saying “I am the only God”, “there is no other God”, “I, your God, am the only one”, etc. We all know that when someone repeats the same thing over and over again it is because they are not sure of what they are saying, which is why they have to repeat it so often. The Gnostics’ interpretation of this is that the creator suspects, since he is not altogether sure, that there is another God higher than him. A God infinitely more superior to him, 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"much bigger, much more important than him, and that is what he is trying to hide by incessantly repeating “I am the only one”, “there is no other God”. Without a doubt, this creator god is the creator of the world, of all the worlds, the planets, the universe, matter and time. He is responsible for what physicists today call the Big Bang. Everything maintained by modern physics, that everything started with a huge explosion, a flash of light, coincides with most of the myths of all religions concerning the creation of the world. First god created light, then he created various other things until he managed to create animals and then finally, man. All these myths in the bible and other religious books agree with the modern- day conclusions of physicists and biologists concerning the creation of the world and man. Of course this creation is full of mistakes and is imperfect. And if this world is imperfect, if matter is imperfect or if everything that exists in the universe is imperfect, it is because the creator of all this is an imperfect being. Today a Gnostic would say for example “dinosaurs were a stupid idea; it was a mistake, the creator had to wipe them out, eliminate them all and start again with another experiment, until he managed to do something with which he was satisfied”. Because the creator god has plans. We will be looking later at what these are about. Physicists also maintain, Albert Einstein for one, that the universe is not something infinite, but is like a kind of bubble, in which all creation is contained. The universe is finite, claimed Einstein. This creation is limited, it is like a huge bubble in which everything created by the creator god is contained, and we do not know what exists outside of this. Gnosis claims to know, as we shall now see. 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"In sacred books of various religions, which are said to be inspired by the creator god of the universe, we are related facts, details, which show the creator god to be an imperfect being and not entirely good. He is sometimes portrayed as being vindictive, bad-tempered, arrogant, insecure and indecisive. A god who loves sacrifices in his name, genocide, and who orders people to kill others, and their belongings, land, people and livestock to be taken away. He gives orders to kill not only his enemies but also women, children and animals. A god who commits genocide. This god demands sacrifices in his name, since he loves the smell of the burnt flesh of the victims sacrificed at the altar. This is the god who caused the Flood. How many hundreds of thousands of men drowned in the Flood! This is how it is related in the bible and other pre- biblical texts, like that of the Babylonian Flood for example. He has a taste for sacrificing people and animals and for the spilt blood of his enemies. He likes to be admired, adored, served, feared and obeyed. He likes the temples built in his honour, the rituals, the commandments, the accomplishment of his orders, the prayers sent up to him. He likes the pain suffered by all his living beings, the torture, the suffering. Ancient Gnostics used to call him Ialdabaoth which means “son of chaos”; sometimes he was called Sabaot: “god of exertion”. They also used to call him Kosmocrator or the Great Arconte, the creator and arranger of matter. But the name most commonly given to him by Gnostics is the demiurge, Greek for creator. Without a doubt, this “superior being” cannot be good and throughout history those who maintained this, (these ideas that I am relating), were naturally persecuted or paid with their lives for daring to say that which for them was the truth. A superior being who loves wars, filicide, and 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"who orders the genital mutilation of boys cannot possibly be a good god. That is why Gnostics likened him to satan. They considered him to be a creator satan. We now know what the destiny of Gnostics, their doctrines and books was to be: they were set on fire, destroyed. Such is the destiny of those called “heretics”, as they have been dubbed throughout the course of history. This world, created by the creator god, belongs only to him. All the physical things in this world respond to him, adore him, admire him. Of course the doctrines of which we are giving accounts are condemned to be persecuted forever and are not going to have much influence or enjoy great success. Only a brave minority can study, interpret or maintain these ancient and eternal Gnostic ideas and they are, unquestionably, in enemy territory. But Gnosis is always present in this strange world in which it does not belong. And this Gnostic thought, opposed to all conventionally established ideas is the most persecuted and rejected of all. There are subjects which “should not” be touched, things which “should not” be said, books which “ought to” disappear, since we live in a world in which we only have the freedom to say “two plus two is four”. This world is an enemy ground for a Gnostic. A Gnostic will be able to appear, speak and quickly disappear since all creation will automatically turn against him. How many years ahead could Jesus Christ predict according to the christian myth? Only three. But in these three years a successful religion was formed which has now been known on Earth for 2000 years! We were saying that this world is an enemy ground for a Gnostic, because the whole of this material world and all the beings that populate it are made from matter and are devotees of matter. They belong to and defend matter and 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"its creator and cannot conceive of anything different. All those opposed to the material world and the creator god are dangerous and must be destroyed. Gnosis is therefore perceived as something unthinkable and horrific which must be eliminated. Gnostics have represented the creator god as something horrific, taking the form of an octopus or reptile, sometimes with the head of a pig, a wild boar or a donkey. That is why certain religions forbid the consumption of these animals. He has also been represented as something similar to the demiurgic baphomet of the templars and the followers of certain masonic sects. Some Gnostics have also represented the creator god as a huge multiple-eyed wild boar, half asleep, which exhales breath of time, since as we have said, time is the breath of this creator god. Unquestionably, this world is not good. Animals have to rip each other apart and destroy each other in order to eat and survive. Human beings need to cheat on each other in all ranks of life to better themselves, to compete and to survive better. Herbivores need to destroy plants which are also living beings. Everything is constantly destroying itself and others. And there are those which call this “perfection” or “perfect balance”. Incredible! This is hell. It is not a perfect system or even a good one. It is a system in which everyone has to destroy something else in order to survive. This is the system created, this is the world created by a “superior being”: the creator god or demiurge. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"5. THE CREATION OF THE WORLD We have already seen that Gnostics maintain that the demiurge or creator god is quite an inept and ignorant being, that he ignores the effects that each of his creations will have. He tries things out, progressing in his creations through trial and error. We have also compared the myths regarding the creation of the world with the Big Bang of modern physics. There is an extraordinary book written by Oscar Kiss Maerth, called “The Beginning Was the End” in which is clearly stated the parallel between the Genesis of the bible and modern physics, both positions in perfect agreement. Gnostics used to say for example that this god is a god who gets tired, who needs to rest on the seventh day and that because of this he cannot be an absolutely perfect god. Gnostics always maintained that the universe was created by a demiurge, by a perverse and wicked creator. They were always wondering why the universe is so imperfect. It is like this because it was created by an equally imperfect being. It was made in his image and resemblance. Another interesting thing about the myths of various religions is that the creator isn’t creating alone, he says “let us make”, as if there were many creators working together. “Let us make this”, “Let us make that”. The bible says: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness”. Us, 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"our. Why? Who are the others? Who else is he creating with? Saint Augustine in his book “On the Trinity”, skilfully and wittily, says it once very clearly. The creator says “let us make”, in the plural because he is speaking of the three divine persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, who are three and yet one at the same time. That is why god speaks in the plural. Augustine never returns to this issue. He settles the matter like this once and for all. For Gnosis, the demiurge is not alone in his task of material creation, forming different worlds, evolutionary processes, beings and entities. In India for example, they call them devas , constructing devas . They are the angels who help with the creation. They are inferior to the creator god but they are with him, helping him. The creator god has delegated many tasks to the creating angels. This was believed in ancient Babylon and the religions of the ancient east. Innumerable creating angels help the creator to develop his plan in the material world or as the Gnostics would say, in the hellish world of matter, which he creates and gives form to. The creator god is the one in charge, but he relies on an army of helpers, of constructing angel-demons who support him in his creation and carry out his orders. That is why in Genesis the creator is called elohim . The bible story begins in this way: Bereshit bará elohim (“In the beginning the gods created...”), because elohim in Hebrew is plural and means “gods”, “lords”. Gnostics point out that these gods are the demiurge and his constructing angel-demons which in great numbers, millions of them, help him in his task of creation. Even in systems of thought that oppose Gnosis, those which see the creation of the world as something good, we 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"hear mention of these constructing helpers and their hierarchies, into which they are divided according to their functions. There are modern theosophical texts, like those of Blavatsky and Bailey amongst others, in which we can find out more about their names and duties. The regent of the Earth for example is Sanat Kumara. Changing around two letters gives us his real name: Satan Kumara. A name that is hardly hidden, since human beings still must not know the truth, or the future that the creator has in store for them. It is better then that this character’s name is not widely known...for now. Mankind is still not ready for the news that the planet Earth has a regent who is a satan. A satan inferior to the other one, the big one, the main one, the most important one in this created material system, this finite universe which is limited and full of imperfections, which he has managed to create. In Gnostic myths, these satanic constructors who help the demiurge are represented as monsters. 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"6. THE CREATION OF MAN Almost all the religious myths relate that man “was created by God from dust of the ground”. The bible clearly says: “And the Lord God formed man of dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul”. It is saying here that god created the body and the soul of man. A physical material part, the body of dust, and an animic part, the breath of the creator, which we call soul. Now then, if man were only a body and a soul he would be like any other animal. Slightly more intelligent than the others maybe, but inside he would be more or less the same as an animal. Later we will see that after his so-called “fall”, man such as we know him today is more than a body and a soul. Although god created the body and the soul there is something else. There is an uncreated Spirit, not created by god, which has been imprisoned, enclosed, in the soul of man. The bible doesn’t say so because the bible speaks of that created by god, and god created the body and soul. But Gnostics maintain that man has a body, a soul and a Spirit. Where did this Spirit, not created by the creator god, come from? Why is It there? This is one of the next issues we will be looking into. The man in Eden, this “paradise” in which god placed him, didn’t know who he was, he was only carrying out orders. He was naming the animals for example, being a 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"sort of administrator, or representative of the creator god. There, in this “paradise” which god had prepared for him, it was like he was asleep, he did not know who he was or where he had come from. Man became aware of who he was, found himself, only after what was called “the sin”, the Disobedience, when he ate the forbidden fruit and was thrown out of paradise. We will also be looking at this later on. We have said that god created the body and the soul. For Gnostics, all creation is satanic, evil and originates from a satan creator, a satanic demiurge. So not only the body but also the soul of man is something evil and satanic. 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"7. THE UNKNOWABLE GOD For Gnostics, there exists another God higher than the one who created the world and man. The creator god is not the only god. There is above him another God, infinitely superior and perfect. This God, unknowable to man, is outside of this hellish and impure creation. It is impossible for man to find this God via his body and soul, imperfect and created as they are. Only the man who has completely freed himself from this can have the slightest idea or inkling of intuition of what this God, who is outside this finite and limited universe, is about. The ancient Greeks called him Agnostos Theos, the Unknown God. This God is, for the Gnostics, not only unknown but rather impossible to know, unknowable, at the very least with our ordinary form of being in this world. With a body and soul we cannot have the slightest idea of what this God, who is outside all this whole system and infinitely superior to the creator god, is. A God impossible to recognise with this body and soul, from this universe created from matter and time. This God does not belong to a material plane but to an antimatter one. He is an antimatter God, who abhors the hell of the created matter, who with our current state of being we are not able to recognise, nor even imagine. He is a mystery to us. This Unknowable God is like an inconceivable and indescribable fire. He is the True God. 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"But this True God, normally out of our reach, cannot manifest himself or act in this impure and imperfect universe, in these hellish dimensions of created matter and time. Only in exceptional cases can the Unknowable God penetrate these dimensions, through one of his Messengers, in order to make a generally small change, and with great sacrifice. This only happens on very rare occasions, given the conditions here, in this material hell. 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"8. BODY, SOUL AND SPIRIT Gnosis maintains that man is formed from three substances, three elements: the body, the soul and the Spirit. We have seen that the body and soul were created by the creator god. He created the body from the dust of the earth and gave it a soul by breathing his breath into man’s nose. The body, as much as the soul, was created by the demiurge or creator god. But there is another element in man which is uncreated, which the creator god did not create. An element which comes from another world, another kingdom, from the unknowable kingdom of antimatter which in our normal state we cannot even imagine. This spark of antimatter without which no human being would have evolved to become what he is today, is the Spirit. Without It, no human being would ever have differentiated himself from a common animal. This special spark, uncreated, divine, coming from the unknowable kingdom, is called Spirit by Gnostics. According to Gnosis, this Spirit, which doesn’t belong to this world, has been lured into and tied to the hellish matter, in order to make use of It, to use It as a driving force of the material evolution. An uncreated spark has been trapped in each man to start off this evolutionary process which figures in the plans of the creator god. Divine Spirits are used to advance evolution on this plane of impure 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"matter. The Spirit, formed completely from antimatter is trapped, chained up, imprisoned in this hell, and suffering torment that is impossible for us to imagine. It is one of the cruellest forms of torture there is, being bound to this abominable world of matter, to this created monstrosity which we call the body-soul of man. The Spirit is shackled against Its will and is used in each human being to advance his evolution, so that the creator god’s plans can be carried out. It is unbearable agony for the Spirit: imprisoned against Its will in a world which for It is strange and impure, being used as a disposable object so that an insane plan can be accomplished. Later we will be looking into this in more detail. In other words, the Spirit, the uncreated antimatter spark, originating from the unknowable kingdom, is enclosed, we can say, within a bubble of created matter and is chained up there, crucified in the matter. Gnostics maintain that if it had not been for the use of the Spirit, man would never have stopped being a hominid. He would never have evolved like he has. We can see how quickly he has evolved over just a few thousand years, as opposed to the millions of years he lived being little more than a monkey. Such is the power that the Spirit provides to this created monstrosity called body-soul. This Spirit is tied to the soul; if man died, the soul would leave the body and take with it the Spirit which is tied to it. The Spirit is not tied to the body, It communicates with the body through the soul, and Its bond is with the soul. The soul is the breath of the creator god on man, which turned him into “a living soul”. The soul is the animic aspect in a human being, it is not something immensely superior like the uncreated Spirit. 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"There is much confusion regarding these issues; that is why throughout this description of Gnostic ideas we are expressing a somewhat different viewpoint to the usual one, so that everyone can at least have the option of being able to choose something which is really quite different to the rest. The Spirit is in this world but It doesn’t belong to it. It does not belong to this illusory world of matter and time. We can infer that if this spark of antimatter fire, the Spirit, could free Itself from the prison, Its behaviour in this world would be extremely aggressive. Firstly, since It is antimatter It abhors matter. Secondly, because It has been skilfully trapped and shackled against Its will for thousands of years. Naturally then, on an abstract level of reasoning, if this Spirit could free Itself, the first thing It would do would be to destroy. Destroy everything that surrounded It in this impure world, the created world, the material universe of the creator god. This Spirit is not an evil being, but it would be the normal behaviour of someone who had been confined in a prison unfairly and against their will. Tricked and against their will as Gnostics say. Imprisoned in a world to which It does not belong, in a satanic world of matter and time. An interesting fact is that, at the beginning of christianity, the existence of these three entities in man - body, soul and Spirit - was upheld. Saint Paul, for example, accepted this, Saint Augustine as well. Later it was lost through the councils and decisions of the pope and the roman church. It remained as it is known to us now: body and soul. Now it would appear that the soul is the only divine thing within man and that there is nothing else. What happened to the Spirit? It has disappeared. It is striking that it has happened this way. Later we will be coming back to 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 this issue."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"9. THREE KINDS OF MAN We have stated that human beings are composed of body, soul and Spirit. We will therefore have three different kinds of man according to which aspect he is most influenced by, the body, soul or Spirit. Since ancient times, man has been categorized by Gnostics in this way: in terms of the physical, psychic and the Spiritual. These categories were also used by Saint Peter. The cathars, for example, also divided man into three different types: terrestrial (hyletics), if ruled by the body; psychic, if ruled by the soul and spiritual (pneumatic) if ruled by the Spirit. In one of the Gnostic Works found in Nag Hammadi, called “The Tripartite Tractate”, we find the same differentiation of man into the material, psychic and spiritual. Julius Evola, in his book on tantric yoga based on ancient Indian traditions, classifies men into three types, having the same characteristics as we see here: pasu, vira and divya. Pasu means animal and refers to the man-animal in which the body and its instincts dominate. Vira is the warrior who is striving to wake up. He is somewhat confused but fights to free himself from this material world and fulfil his Spirit. Finally divya, the third type of man, whose Spirit has already been liberated and rules absolutely. Perfect man is found in this group. 33"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"10. SATAN, THE OPPRESSOR Man in his normal state is lost in confusion, sleepy, not knowing who he is, where he came from or where he is going. He does not know what he should be doing and is in a state of confusion, as if in a mist or half-asleep. When we were talking about the creator of the world, we said that for Gnostics, the creator, the demiurge, the creator of matter, the universe and man can be likened to satan, since matter is satanic, all creation is satanic and the creator is a satanic being. This creator oppresses man. Since the creation of man, he has forced him to carry out his orders and obey his precepts and commands. This creator wants to be obeyed by man, admired, feared and adored by him by means of sacrifices and rituals. He wants to impose his oppressive rules on man. He wants man to obey him and renounce his own wishes, which are very often the desires of his Spirit, of this Spiritual Self that, although ignored by man is carried within him. The creator, according to Gnosis, has a plan for his creation, which is why he created the universe and placed man in it. He has a plan he wants to press ahead with and he needs man in order to do this. However he needs man to act in agreement with his orders, those of the creator, and not according to the desires of the Spirit. The demiurge does not allow the Spirit, shackled in the soul of man, to manifest Itself. He wants man to act through his soul and not his Spirit. For 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36 this reason it is necessary to oppress man, frighten and worry him.

We had said that this God, the greatest one, unreachable and unknowable, is unable to penetrate this limited universe of impure and satanic matter. But according to these myths, he can send someone, Lucifer. Only with a supreme sacrifice can an incredibly Spiritual and pure being of antimatter fire break through into the infernal world of this universe. According to Gnostic legends and myths, the great Unknowable God sent Lucifer, angel of indescribable fire and light, to show man the light and to help him wake up and see his true origin, the origin of his Spirit, which has been perversely imprisoned in this impure matter called body-soul. He is an uncreated being, who came to the created world to bring Light: Liberating Gnosis. The saving knowledge which can wake man up and help him free his imprisoned Spirit. The knowledge which allows him to know who he truly is, why he is here in this world and what he has to do to liberate himself and fulfil his Spirit, which belongs to another uncreated and unknowable plane. We have said that Lucifer came to the world to wake man up, to help him remember his divine origin, the divine origin of his Spirit, and to help him free himself from the body-soul in which he is trapped, and from created time and matter. 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Gnostics consider that the biblical myth of creation can be explained as follows: the creator satan of the world trapped Adam and Eve in his miserable world, and Lucifer, in the form of a serpent, offered them the forbidden fruit of saving Gnosis, and showed them that the creator was deceiving them. In other words, the creator said to man “but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.” On the other hand, the Serpent said “You will not surely die. For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” The bible continued: “And the eyes of both of them were opened”. It doesn’t say “they both died”, it says “the eyes of both of them were opened”, like the Serpent had said. Later, the creator says “And now man has become as one of us, to know good and evil”. The creator lied. He said that man would die if he ate the fruit, but man did not die. The Serpent was telling the truth. The creator himself ended up agreeing that the Serpent was right. More precisely, Gnostics called the demiurge a liar as well as a plagiarizer. For them, the entire creation is a failed attempt by the demiurge to imitate the unknowable world. In this way, they think that the bible itself is a complete plagiarism, based principally on pre-biblical Babylonian and Egyptian texts. Gnostics believe that this Serpent Lucifer is the liberator of man and the world. It is wisdom, the liberating Gnosis that wakes man up and saves him. Of course, this Messenger of the Unknowable God, Lucifer, is an opponent and an enemy of the creator of the world.

But Lucifer, the Angel of Light, made a great sacrifice and descended into this satanic hell to give the forbidden fruit of Gnosis to man, and opened his eyes so that he would be able to remember his divine origin and his superiority in relation to the creator. Gnostics consider that before the arrival of the Serpent in paradise, man was in a state of ignorance and was blind to his true situation. They maintain that Adam and Eve were in a state of servitude until the Serpent Lucifer opened their eyes and fed them the fruit of knowledge, which made them remember their divine origin and become aware of the situation in which they found themselves. Of course, the creator threw Adam and Eve out of this paradise in which he had placed them since he wanted them (and still does) to reflect him and be similar to him after his image and resemblance, and to carry out his precepts so as to be like him and not like the Unknowable God. He wants the Spirit to stay asleep so he can take advantage of Its energy, preventing It from manifesting Itself in man and the world. Lucifer, liberator of man and the world, has also been called Abaddon, the Exterminator. But...exterminator of what? Exterminator of matter, because he abhors this created world of matter and time. He would behave like a hostile antimatter force, extremely aggressive, because he hates all that has been created as he also hates the body and soul of man, since he belongs to the uncreated plane of the unknowable. He is an exterminator, but an exterminator of matter, of the impure. Such is the Gnostic legend of Lucifer. Now we can go on to describe what uncreated entities exist in this created world. 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Firstly, the Unknowable God, who is not in this world but who can infiltrate it with a tiny particle of Himself, a Messenger. This Messenger is also uncreated, not having been created by the creator. Secondly, the imprisoned Spirits of men, which also belong to the unknowable World of the uncreated and the eternal. According to Gnosis all living beings have an uncreated Spiritual element enchained in their souls: the Spirit. The Spirit locked within man is totally superior to that of animals, plants and other living beings. The difference between man and the other living beings is very great, as is the difference between the Spirits imprisoned inside of them. The Spirits of human beings are in an elevated Spiritual category. Thirdly, another uncreated entity placed on this created plane is the saving and divine knowledge of Gnosis. Knowledge that has come from outside, which has not been produced inside of this world. 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"12. THE SERPENT OF SALVATION We have said that, according to the Gnostic interpretation of Genesis, the creator god imprisoned Adam and Eve in a world of misery and gave them a subservient soul. The bible says that after eating the forbidden fruit Adam and Eve hid themselves, ashamed by the mistake they had made. God arrived in paradise and called Adam with these words: “Where are you?” He appeared to be acting like a master calling his servant. When he didn’t find him, he seemed to be saying: “Where are you? Where have you hidden yourself? What have you done? Why are you not here working?” This creator god created Adam and Eve incapable of distinguishing between good and evil, between the uncreated kingdom and the created one. He also created them ignorant of their origin and their destiny. Why did he create them like this? According to Gnosis, the creator didn’t want man to know his true origin. This world was created against the will of the Unknowable God and this was something the creator did not want man to know. He didn’t want them (and still doesn’t) to know the Spiritual situation in which they were living, who they were or why they had been created. He wanted them to remain ignorant and still does so to this day. This is why he forbade them to eat from the tree of knowledge. Because it would “open their eyes”, wake them up and make them 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"notice who they were and where they came from, the situation they were in and what they had to do. It would make them aware that Eden wasn’t paradise, but just the opposite. In his book “La franc-maçonnerie”, Father Leon Meurin describes the Gnostic interpretations of the earthly paradise and the Serpent of Genesis, and the following ideas come up: Jehovah does not want man to know his origin or his great destiny. He forbids all contact with the higher world. He wants man to be a reflection of him, the creator, and not a reflection of the Supreme God . But man did wake up, and he did become aware of good and evil. How did he manage to do this? The Serpent of temptation in Eden fed him the forbidden fruit which opened his eyes. According to Gnostics this Serpent is Lucifer, the Messenger of Light. This is the meaning of the word Lucifer: Bearer of Light. Lucifer took the form of a serpent to wake man up. He is a Messenger of the Supreme God, the Unknowable God. He is a Messenger of the True God who came into this imperfect, inadequate and wretched world to wake up and liberate man, to show him his true situation and what his great destiny could be like. For this reason, those who follow the orders of the creator god consider the serpent to be something malicious and satanic and in all this confusion liken it with satan. On the other hand, Gnostics see the Serpent Lucifer as a saviour, someone who came to save man, a Messenger of the True God. This Serpent of Enlightenment which brought Gnosis, Gnostic truth which allows the authentic and true nature of things to be seen in this world of confusion, came to liberate man. Lucifer is the true liberator of man. He came to liberate man from the tyranny 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"of Yahve, from the tyranny of the creator god. He brought the real knowledge that in itself can free man and help him to escape from this satanic world and return to the world from which he came. This Serpent is, for Gnostics, the Serpent of Salvation, the Serpent which opened the eyes of man, which offered him the apple of emancipation to help him wake up and free himself from this world of misery and impure matter. The creator wanted to create man like the other living beings, incapable of distinguishing between good and evil but the Serpent’s actions woke them up and liberated them. According to Gnostics, this knowledge, this Gnosis which the Serpent Lucifer brought to man, undoubtedly caused a great cosmic disturbance in the creation. This is how powerful this knowledge is. Gnosis causes changes in those who receive it, in those who listen to it because it is not common or current knowledge, it is liberating knowledge. There is an interesting book written by Ernst Bloch called “Atheism in Christianity”, which gives a good synthesis of this whole aspect of Gnostic thought, the aspect related to the Serpent of Liberation as a Messenger of the True God. Gnostics of later times, at the beginning of Christianity, who came to be known as Christian Gnostics or Gnostic Christians, regarded Christ as the Serpent of Genesis. This was because Christ, much later than the events in the earthly paradise, came carrying a liberating message, just like the Serpent. A message which frees man from this impure world. These Christian Gnostics believe that it was this knowledge which allowed man to make contact with the other world, the one opposed to the demiurge: the unknowable world of the True God. Christ, the bearer of this message, this Gnosis, has been 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"likened to the Serpent of Genesis, who returns to Earth for a second time to help humanity. The first coming was Serpent Lucifer and the second was Christ Lucifer. According to christian Gnosis, when Christ came to the world, it was his second time, since the first time was in the earthly paradise. In both cases it was, actually, Lucifer, the Messenger of the Unknowable. In both cases, the message was the same: Gnosis that disturbs, causes changes, wakes up and liberates those who listen to it. For Christian Gnostics, the Serpent is Christ, the Saviour who came to this world twice. There is a Gnostic diagram of a crucified serpent, hammered onto a cross, which further shows the Gnostic identity between the Serpent of Genesis and Christ. There are myths which state that the cross on which Christ was crucified was made of wood from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. There was a time when all this knowledge was written down and passed on. But this period lasted until the “conversion” of Constantine and the reinforcement of the roman church as the official religion of the Roman Empire. Since then, books and documents about Gnosis have been forbidden, persecuted and destroyed. Very few of these texts remain. Origen, for example, described a Gnostic diagram in which you can clearly see a serpent dividing the two worlds, the created world and the uncreated world. Although no-one likes this dualism, this is how reality is and has to be accepted. Gnostics know that another extremely perfect world exits, which has nothing to do with this one. Origen was able to have access to these Gnostic diagrams and books, to all this information, in order to later criticize it, as did Saint Augustine, Tertullian, Hippolytus, 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Irenaeus of Lyons, Epiphanius and many others. But now, most of the original Gnostic texts no longer exist and have been destroyed. These critics of Gnosis distorted all the information from the original Gnostic texts, taking sentences out of context to make them look ridiculous, among other cunning strategies. But none of this matters now. Primordial Gnosis is always present, although there are many who are not aware of it. In the different circumstances in which it has appeared openly in the world, it has always been the same Gnosis, although with different historical and cultural connotations. Although forbidden and persecuted, Gnosis never disappeared and never will disappear. It will always stay within the reach of those who deserve it. The more it is persecuted, the more it gathers strength. As well as Bloch’s book, there are other interesting books which describe these aspects of ancient Gnosis, in which Eden’s Serpent of Salvation is referred to. One such book is “Adan, le dieu rouge”, by Robert Ambelain; another is “Gnostics and their Remains” by C. W. King, the latter having been written in the nineteenth century. There is one interesting piece of information about the Serpent of Genesis in the book “The Refutation of All Heresies”, written by Hippolytus, a great persecutor of the Gnostics. In this book, Hippolytus comments on and criticizes some of the words of Celsus, which to him are horrifying. It is about the part of Celsus in which he states, referring to the events in the earthly paradise, that just as the creator cursed the serpent when it destroyed his plans and ruined his work, so must the creator be cursed by every man who has woken up. Just as the creator cursed the Serpent of Salvation, so the creator himself will be cursed as long as he exists, by every 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Spirit liberated from his clutches . Hippolytus, horrified, observed that even though he knew that Gnostics likened the creator god with satan, had never imagined that they would also curse him. In fact, in the few Gnostic books rescued from the flames, we see that the creator god is sometimes called satan. Gnostic tradition refers to the demiurge as “satan, the creator of the world and man”, “satan and his demons, creators of the world”, and other such things. 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"13. CAIN, THE IMMORTAL Everybody knows what happened after the “fall” of man, according to Genesis. Adam and Eve were thrown out of paradise and had children. First Cain and then Abel. Everybody knows that “God did not accept the sacrifices which Cain offered him but did accept Abel’s”. So Cain, consumed by jealousy, threw himself on his brother and killed him. Everybody knows this; we have always thought “how bad Cain was”, “he killed his brother, how terrible”. Cain was the bad one and Abel the good; this is the interpretation given to us in judaism, christianity and islam. Even Saint Augustine in his interpretation of the myth of Cain and Abel compares Cain with the Jews and Abel with Christ. He says that the Jews killed Christ in the same way that Cain killed Abel. Saint Augustine then, like everyone else, carried on the tradition that Abel was good and Cain was bad. It is very clear in the bible; Cain is punished by God, banished. This is seen as something logical and normal: Cain is bad and Abel is good. The Gnostic interpretation is completely different as we will now see. First of all, Gnosis maintains that Cain was not the son of Adam and that Eve conceived her first son Cain with the Serpent, Lucifer. The Serpent Lucifer impregnated Eve with his breath. In other words, Cain was not completely human, born from flesh. His Spiritual nature was great 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"because his father was Lucifer, coming from the unknowable world of the Spirit. On the other hand, Abel was the son of Adam and Eve, in other words Abel was indeed born from flesh. We can now see the first difference between the two brothers: Cain is superior to Abel. Cain is the son of Eve and Lucifer, the initiatory Serpent of Eden. Cain is the son of the Spirit and of flesh. Abel, on the contrary, is born only from flesh. Therefore we can see first of all that Cain is not someone evil but that in fact he is superior, important, and much more so than Abel. Secondly, Cain as much as Abel made sacrifices to the creator god to please him, offering him things that he liked. Cain offered vegetables and Abel animals, lambs for example. According to the bible the creator god preferred the latter: the blood from the dead animals and the smell of burnt flesh of the corpse. The bible says that the creator was pleased by Abel’s sacrifices but not by Cain’s. It appeared that Cain had little desire to please the creator since he only offered him a few seeds and with little devotion, as if he wasn’t entirely convinced of the usefulness of making sacrifices. Naturally then, Abel’s sacrifices were accepted by the creator and Cain’s weren’t. Cain didn’t like to offer sacrifices to the creator because of his roots, because he was the son of Lucifer and had the divine spark of the Angel of Light within him. That is why he did not make suitable sacrifices to the creator and why it disgusted him to do so since he did not belong to this created world. Abel, on the other hand, whose nature was not of the Spirit but of an animal, did make suitable sacrifices and these were the ones which most pleased the creator. An ancient legend relates what Abel said to his brother Cain on one particular occasion: “my sacrifice, my 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"offering, was accepted by God because I love him, your offering was on the other hand rejected because you hate him”. Now it is quite clear, Cain hates the creator because he is born from the Spirit, his true nature is Spiritual! Put this way it is quite clear. All these legends and myths surrounding Genesis tell us many things. Through them we realise that much information has been distorted and hidden from us. There are other interesting things which Cain said to his brother. One small sentence sums up his position. These words are key: “There is no law, no judge” Palestinian Targum, Gen., 4:8). Cain is denying the authority of the creator god and the fact of paying homage to and obeying him. Later on we see that Cain murdered his brother Abel. This is something very profound as it signifies that the Spirit rejects, destroys and murders the soul. Abel, presented as pure love and devotion in the bible, represents the soul of man according to Gnostics. Cain, on the contrary, represents the Spirit, which explains his hostility and hatred. Hostility and hatred typical of the Spirit, since the Spirit really hates this impure world, full of unfair and absurd rules. This explains Cain’s resistance to making sacrifices and his disobedience as regards the creator’s commandments. Cain and Abel are as opposed and irreconcilable as are the Spirit and the soul. The soul is pure love, not True Love but that which we know as love, that which we believe is love, that which we have been told is love, which in actual fact is hatred. The Spirit is the opposite; It is perceived as pure hatred, hostility and revenge. Due to being shackled in this satanic creation the only thing the Spirit can feel is hostility and hatred, that which ordinary men know as hatred. The Spirit, 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"which is Pure Love, can only feel aversion and disgust before this thing that is, in fact, pure garbage. That is why the Spirit wants to destroy this satanic creation, because for It, creation is a deformed monstrosity which should never have come into existence. This is what Cain’s murder of Abel symbolises. Cain, through his actions, freed himself completely from the creator and from his own body and soul. Through these acts against the creator god and his half-brother Abel he freed himself once and for all from the inferior god and his impure and flawed creation. With these acts he transformed himself into an opponent, an eternal enemy of the demiurge and his work. This whole episode of Cain and Abel, such as it is in Genesis in the bible and in legends such as the jewish midrash amongst others, has been interpreted by Gnostics in a way that totally opposes the generally accepted version. After committing his Supreme Act, the bible says that Cain was cursed by god and banished from that place. “Cursed and banished”, the same destiny as the Serpent of paradise. It was logical that this should happen, as Cain had turned himself into an absolute opponent of the creator god, but as well as that, many more interesting things happened which we are going to be highlighting here: First of all, we saw that Cain was cursed and banished by the creator god. This, which could have appeared to be punishment, is just the opposite for a Gnostic. To be cursed and banished by the creator is an honour for a Gnostic. It is the natural reaction of the demiurge faced with someone who has defied him and slapped him in the face, faced with someone who has made himself equal or superior to him. Cain is in exile because he completely transformed himself, 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"successfully exiled himself and now no longer belongs to this world, although he carries on living in it. The bible says that the creator banished him, but Cain is free, liberated in life and through his acts he cursed the creator and exiled himself from this abominable creation. Secondly, several jewish legends relate that the creator punished Cain forever with insomnia, condemning him never to sleep again, with eternal wakefulness. To a Gnostic, this is not punishment but a triumph. Being condemned to eternal wakefulness is an advantage, a virtue, an important achievement. Cain woke himself up disobeying the creator’s commandments and “murdered” his soul. Thirdly, the bible says that the creator protected Cain, not allowing anyone to harm or kill him. This is another interesting fact. Gnostics say that a man who has transformed himself into pure Spirit, although he continues to inhabit his physical body, is immortal, untouchable. Absolutely no-one can harm or attack him now and he has no fear since he is beyond everything and will never die. He is in this world but outside of it as well. He is outside of matter and time and now does not form part of creation. He exiled himself from this world by his own will. The creator god can’t harm him anymore, because Cain is now superior to him. Fourthly, the bible says that the creator put a mark on Cain, a sign, so that everyone would recognise him and would not hurt him. Some ancient jewish legends say that this sign was a horn on his forehead. A horn on the forehead signifies power, power that comes from the Spirit, power that distinguishes him from other men. This callous on his forehead signifies that the Spirit has freed Itself and has taken possession of the body, hardening it, Spiritualising it. 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"No-one put a mark on Cain. Cain put it there himself. When this happens, it is noticed by other men and the whole of creation. Every Spirit freed from the prison of matter will have this mark for all eternity. Now the Spirit will never be what It was before being shackled to matter. That characteristic mark is the body transformed, as hard as a diamond. The Spirit has transmuted the body and is now immortal and eternal. This will be Its eternal reminder, the everlasting proof of Its path through hell and Its triumph over it. We can find several syntheses in the Gnostic explanation of the myth of Cain in Mgr. Meurin’s book on masonry which we quoted earlier. Also in “Le dieu rouge” by Robert Ambelain and also in “Atheism in Christianity”, by Ernst Bloch. Likewise, there are also several interesting facts in “The Hebrew Myths” by Graves and Patai. There is also a very profound Gnostic interpretation of this myth in a strange novel I found on the Internet called “El Misterio de Belicena Villca”. 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"14. THE PLANS OF THE CREATOR GOD According to Gnostics, the creator god has many plans, which together make up his “grand plan”. This was the reason why he created the universe and man. To achieve his objectives he is going ahead with an evolutionary experiment in which the body, soul and the Spirit of man are taking part. He goes on practicing, trying things out, and if he succeeds he will extend the results to his entire created universe. If he fails, he will have to do away with this project and start again from scratch, as he has done so many times, to try something else again and again. The fact is that he will never be able to make a perfect copy of what he imagined is the unknowable world, which he tries to imitate in vain. Without a doubt, in this last experiment he achieved success which, although imperfect, has some value. After millions of years of fruitless practicing, he has within a few thousand years made a notable step in the evolution of his greatest work: man. After millions of years of evolutionary suspension in which the hominid man lived like just another animal, he has advanced more in the last 30,000 years than throughout all of history. Gnostics associate this mutation or “creation”, this great evolutionary jump, with the use of Spirits of the greatest purity coming from the uncreated world. The creator god modelled a body from the dust of the 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"earth and, with his breath, gave it an animic element, the soul. To this soul, this breath of the creator, he affixed a Spirit, which was trapped through trickery and imprisoned against Its will in this satanic monstrosity of dust and breath: the body and soul of man. It is the divine energy of the imprisoned Spirit which impelled and continues to impel the evolution of the man-animal! And why does the creator want this being to evolve? So that it will transform itself gradually into him. That is why he made his precepts and commands. He wants man to transform into himself, the creator, to become the same as him. The body and soul would be very happy if this happened because they are part of the creator god. But the Spirit is not part of him; It has another origin and another destiny. As long as the Spirit is chained up, everything goes well, It impels evolution. But if even one Spirit frees Itself It disturbs the whole plan. That is why it is so important that the tyranny of the demiurge is absolute, and that all knowledge which could wake man up and make him remember who he really is, remains forbidden because it would be dangerous knowledge, so dangerous that it would be able to destabilise the plan of the creator god. According to Gnosis, only one Spirit which can free Itself would be able to weaken the whole creation and also weaken the creator god, preventing him from continuing with his plans. This Spirit would be a saviour, a saviour of the world and the other Spirits. It would favour the liberation not only of other men but of the entire universe, of the innumerable divine sparks coming from the uncreated and eternal world which find themselves imprisoned here, in this great blind machine, in order to make it work and evolve. This system, created by the demiurge, cannot function 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"unless it possesses these particles of the Spiritual world enslaved, imprisoned here. Gnostics say that of all these Spiritual particles, those imprisoned in human beings are the most important in Spiritual hierarchy and purity. The demiurge created and assembled all this and encourages it to evolve. So that it evolves towards him, with the human being ahead. If the experiment with man fails, he will lay his hands on another of his creatures and try again. We have said that the demiurge wants man to evolve until he turns into him and becomes the same as him, so that every soul, or in other words his own breath, and everyone made of dust can return to him, transforming themselves into him. This is the final objective that the demiurge has for man. Because of all this, it is fundamental to the demiurge to keep the Spirit imprisoned so that he can use Its energy. This is why the demiurge needs man to remain half-asleep and confused so that man keeps on blindly approaching him, the creator, who lures him with tricks and punishment. For this whole system to work, man has to keep on believing that the creator is the only god that exists and that he is a good god. Gnostics maintain that if man evolves to the point where he merges with his creator, at that moment his Spirit will lose all possibility of freeing itself while this universe lasts. 55"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"15. DEATH AND REINCARNATION In the whole of this evolutionary process which the creator god has come up with and is encouraging, the death and reincarnation of man is very important. When a human being dies, the physical body at that point dies; the soul separates from the body and takes the enchained Spirit with it, because the Spirit is shackled to the soul and not to the body. The Spirit is connected to the body through the soul. After physical death the soul retreats, taking this Spirit with it. The soul takes the Spirit to other planes and there it continues to be punished. For Gnostics, this world is hell; it is full of punishment and suffering from birth until death. But after death the suffering continues and, what‘s more, can become even more intense. The soul is punished for all the behaviour it indulged in on Earth while it was in the physical body. The suffering continues. The soul is beaten, punished, “cleansed” as some would say, until it is moved to a new body in order for the suffering to continue. Nobody can be saved from hell, not even through death. Once the soul has separated from the body it continues to suffer, and sometimes more so than before. The beatings and punishment continue. And in this way through subsequent deaths and reincarnations, the behaviour of human beings is shaped. Men are deceived, as they are told this punishment is for their own good, that through it they will “improve”, 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"“evolve”, “become better”, “purer”, “holier”, “more like their creator”. More like their creator satan . Ask this creator satan, who is called “Righteous Judge” and “God of Love”, why children die. Also ask him why he invented so many viruses and diseases. He will not reply because as well as being unfair he is also deaf and blind. Gnostics maintain that the creator feeds on the outpouring of pain and weeping produced by man. By means of punishment, the demiurge pretends that man is gradually being “perfected”. “Perfecting himself” means resembling the demiurge, the creator, more and more, The punishment will end when man surrenders to the creator and accepts being like him, renouncing his Spirit. This last thing is what happens when a man or community decides to form a “covenant” or blood pact with the demiurge in order to reduce the suffering a little. In these cases, the man or group of men involved in the pact promise to renounce the Spirit in exchange for power or material riches. Those men renounce Everything, in exchange for very little. You have to be insane or very desperate to make a pact or covenant with the evil demiurge. They have signed their Spiritual death warrant and will be disintegrated when everything that has been created disappears. What should we do then to be like the creator? This has been written about in all the “sacred books” which he inspired. Contained in them is everything that should be done: “adore the creator”, “love your neighbour”, “and do not eat such and such”, “turn the other cheek”, etc. It does not matter that some precepts do not make sense; it is enough to obey them. It is very clear what man has to do to please the creator. The point is that some things are difficult to do, because 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"every man has a Spirit chained up inside of him shouting at him to oppose the demiurge and not to obey him. Of course some men listen to the voice of their Spirit more than others. That is why there is punishment. That is why there is death and subsequent reincarnation. Some men need to be punished more than others in order to be broken. During the suffering, there comes a moment in which man gives himself up, surrenders himself and accepts being like the creator of matter. He does it so that the torture will stop, not for any other reason. In order to surrender himself he has to renounce his Spirit to show the creator that his conviction is absolute, that his conversion is not feigned. In doing this, his Spiritual Self remains absolutely nullified; this is Spiritual death. Now he will no longer listen to the voice inside which shouted at him to oppose, never to surrender himself, to always fight for his freedom; that voice which he hardly heard. The soul has triumphed; the demiurge has triumphed. This man has converted himself into a “saint”, into “an example worthy of being imitated”. For the creator, the point when nothing in man can any longer be a reflection of the Spirit is reason for great jubilation and happiness. Now, there is emptiness inside of that man which is subsequently filled by god. That man has transformed himself into “a representative of God on Earth”, a “living God”, in an equal to his creator. That is one of the most important aspects of the creator god’s “Grand Plan”. That is why he created matter and time, the whole universe and man and why he imprisoned the Eternal Spirits. Once man has merged with god, or has “lost himself in God”, as some religions say, that Spirit has finished his work here. But, far from being liberated, the demiurge will 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"tie up the Spirit again to the soul of another man who is on a lower evolutionary level, in order to keep using It to advance evolution and accomplish the aim of creation: the fusion of man with his creator. The Spirits will only be freed when the creator decides to finish his creation, possibly in thousands of millions of years. Maybe some Spirits can liberate themselves beforehand via their own means, but this is very difficult. The demiurge, knowing that the escape of even one of his prisoners would be catastrophic for him and for his creation, has taken many precautions to avoid this happening. First of all, in order for this plan to work, it is necessary for man to remain asleep. It is necessary that no Spiritual Self can manifest Itself and say “I do not agree”, “this is not my world”, “this is not my life”, “this is not my destiny”, “this world is hell”. We have said that no-one can escape from the suffering. Not even through suicide can the punishment that the creator satan puts his creatures through be avoided. Bodies and souls belong to the creator throughout their whole life and even after death. The only solution is through the liberation of the Spirit. This is the most difficult and important task a man who is only half awake can undertake. We were saying that the creator needs man to remain asleep in order to make his plan concrete. Therefore whichever man or book that helps him to wake up and free his Spirit must be destroyed. That is why all this knowledge, this Gnosis, has been so persecuted and silenced. For the demiurge, it is essential that man does not wake up so that he can lead him, like a sleepwalker, through 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"successive reincarnations, to the highest point in evolution in which, tired of so much suffering, he agrees to surrender his Divine Self, his Eternal Spirit, in order to merge with the creator. 61"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"16. MANVANTARAS AND PRALAYAS Gnosis has an answer to the question of whether creation is eternal or will one day disappear: everything that has been created will have to disappear. The demiurge creates universes and then after a while destroys them. Rabbis say: “The Lord, blessed as he is, creates worlds and destroys them”. In the teachings of the Shankara we find: “Like bubbles in water, the world arise from, exist in, and dissolve into the supreme Lord”. (Atmabodha, 8). Hindus call this “breathing of Brahma”. Brahma is the Hindu creator god. It is another name for the demiurge. The creator god begins a new creation with every Big Bang. This is exhalation, his breath, being exhaled to the outside. This creation expands until he decides to put an end to it, taking it back to the beginning, reabsorbing it. This is inhalation, the absorption of his breath. When creation comes to its end and is destroyed, involution starts; time starts to go backwards until it disappears and there is a long period in which the demiurge does not create anything. In India this phase is called “the night of Brahma”. Each period of creation is followed by a period of cosmic silence in which everything created is taken back, contracting until it disappears. After everything is destroyed and reduced to nothing, another Big Bang starts a new creation and so on and so forth. Each attempt by the demiurge is followed by another, constantly pursuing the 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"perfection that he will never attain. In India, the cycles of creation are called manvantaras and those of destruction pralayas . There is a very common song in Israel called “Adon Olam” (“Master of the World”), in which there is a paragraph that makes us think of the creator’s period of rest after he destroys his work. It goes like this: “And after all is gone, He, the Awesome One, will reign alone”. It is referring to the creator’s period of silence, when nothing created remains. When all creation falls apart, the uncreated continues to exist as always because it is eternal; it has no beginning or end. It belongs to the unknowable plane of eternity. Only that which has been created disappears into the pralaya. Only that which has been created can be destroyed. When the demiurge decides to destroy everything he created, that is to say, when a manvantara has ended, only then are the uncreated Spirits, which remained imprisoned in matter, freed. All matter, every body and every soul will be destroyed. Only the Uncreated, the Non-created, will not be touched by this destruction, returning to the unknowable world from which It came. Gnostics do not want to wait thousands of millions of years. They want to liberate themselves now, as soon as possible. And not only liberate themselves. They also want to put an end to this whole satanic system, the breathing of the demiurge and his insane plans, the torment of the imprisoned Spirits, the successive creations and destructions, death and reincarnation, everything created, everything that is impure and the demiurge as well . 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"17. THE GREAT CONSPIRACY All throughout history, religious and political institutions of the demiurge on Earth have deliberately conspired to eliminate, or at least distort, the Gnostic vision wherever it appears. Any systems of thought in which any trace of Primordial Gnosis can be found is forbidden or misconstrued. This is how dangerous Gnostic knowledge is for the demiurge’s plans. Hiding the Truth is part of the orchestrated plan so that man cannot wake up, let alone rebel. This is about man remaining confused, misled and half-asleep, so that he never comes to realise who he really is and what situation he is in. That he never knows the truth about what has happened, what his present reality is about nor what his future will be. It is hoped that man never finds out the right answers to these three fundamental questions: Who am I? Why am I here? What am I supposed to be doing? But the Truth never disappears. Oppressed and hidden, it will always struggle to be exposed. The worst thing that can be done to the Truth is to forbid it. The opposite effect will be produced: it will emerge with more strength and violence . What is the first thing that would have to be hidden? Firstly, it would be necessary to eliminate the idea that beyond the inefficient demiurge, another God exists, superior to him and infinitely perfect. 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"In order to hide this part of Gnostic Truth, the idea that the creator god and the Unknowable God are the same thing has been invented, that together they form the only existing god: the demiurge, creator of heaven and earth. At the beginning of christianity, the great Gnostic Master Marcion stated it very clearly: “the god of the old testament is not the God of the new testament. They are two different gods. The first is a god who applies the law and punishes, whereas the other is a God of love who always forgives. The two are irreconcilable”. What can be done to conceal this? It was Origen who came up with the following brilliant idea: “There are not two different gods, one fair and the other good. It is the same God, and he is fair and good”. This is how the demiurge came to be good and perfect. Secondly, this is how the difference between the unknowable world and the created world has in this way been eliminated as well. Anyone who refers to the existence of the two irreconcilable kingdoms will be derogatorily labelled as “dualist”; as if describing reality just as it is were a bad thing. The conspirators reduced everything to only one kingdom: the kingdom of the demiurge. Thirdly, if the demiurge is good and perfect, who can we blame for all the bad things that exist in the world? If the divine attributes of the Unknowable God have been transferred to the demiurge, what about the demiurgic attributes of evil and ineptitude, plagiarism and lying? This is why the idea that the demiurge is not satan and that satan is someone else has been invented. The demiurge has become good and perfect, stripped of his satanic features. All the evil now comes from this new satan who is outside of him. The evil of the demiurge has been taken 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"outside, to a satan different to the creator. Now it is this new satan who likes blood, the smell of burnt flesh, the slaves, wars, rituals, sacrifices, conspiracies and genocide. Now it is this new satan who enjoys the fact that men bow down before him in adoration and make covenants or blood pacts with him, in exchange for power or earthly wealth. It is easy to discover that all the characteristics which satan now has were taken from the creator god of the bible. So this is what we have: the Unknowable God does not exist, his attributes have been transferred to the demiurge, and the attributes of the demiurge have been transferred to a satan outside of him. What does this great conspiracy, this big scam, now need? What is lacking is someone who we can transform this satan into. It has to be someone who we very much hate, since satan is the most wretched figure that we can conceive of. Fourthly, this is how the brilliant idea of this conspiracy emerged: it occurred to someone that the most appropriate way would be to disclose the fact that this evil satan is no other than Lucifer. In this way, not only is the demiurge “cleansed” of his satanic nature, but the figure of Lucifer is also completely distorted. The Angel of Light, sent by the Unknowable God to save mankind, was transformed into a monster whose function is to keep man enslaved. A great idea by the demiurge’s Earthly representatives and timely revenge against Lucifer, the eternal enemy of the true satan: the demiurge. From two opposing and irreconcilable entities, the creator god and the Unknowable God, one has been formed: the demiurge “good and unique”. From two opposing and irreconcilable worlds, one has been formed, which is “good”: that of the demiurge. The same process has occurred with the other two opposing and 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"irreconcilable entities: Lucifer and satan, the Messenger of the True God and the creator satan of matter and time. They have been transformed into one entity: The “satanic Lucifer”. This is how the demiurge’s charlatans conspire against the truth. The belief that satan and Lucifer are one and the same thing, what they call the devil, has remained up to this day. In the New Testament, it is already established that Lucifer and satan are the same (Luke, X.18) (2 Corinthians, XI.14). Even in Mgr. Meurin’s work, which we quoted earlier, we find the same confusion: he calls the demiurge “Jehovah- Lucifer” and not “Jehovah-Satan”, which for him would have been correct. And if Meurin, a very well known theologian in the Roman Catholic world, made this mistake, what can we expect from the average man? Fifthly, what can be done to distort the Gnostic idea that this created world is hell and that heaven is the plane of the Unknowable God? The conspirators have conceived of the following idea: they state that this world is not hell, that hell is outside, far from here. Hell would be a place of punishment for those who disobey the demiurge during their lives here on Earth. And what characteristics would this hell have? It occurred to someone that the typical characteristics of the unknowable world could serve very well as a setting for this new hell. If Lucifer, Bearer of Light, a being of fire who is represented ablaze with fire, is satan, we could then say that this hell would be a place full of flames. A place where “sinners” are burnt. As far as Gnostics are concerned, the unknowable kingdom is precisely an antimatter fire which loathes this impure creation and if possible would annihilate it. For Gnostics however, that same fire is something good and desirable and not something satanic. 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The sixth point is that the Spirit was another of the things they considered it important to eliminate or at least render unrecognisable. The representatives of the demiurge on Earth could not allow that, after all the doctoring, the belief that there is something uncreated and divine inside of man still persisted. The Spirit had to be eliminated as well. We have already seen that for Gnostics man is composed of three parts: body, soul and Spirit. The body and soul were created by the demiurge, whereas the Spirit has been captured in the plane of the uncreated and eternal and does not belong to this sphere of creation. The soul and the Spirit, the two entities invisible to the average human eye, are the complete opposite and are irreconcilable. The soul was created by the demiurge; it is that which gives life to the body, the animic aspect. Only the soul longs to be united with its creator, to be merged with him. The Spirit, on the other hand, is a prisoner in this strange world in which It doesn’t belong and which for It is hell. It only wants to liberate Itself and return to the unknowable world from which It came. For the Spirit, the body and the soul are as dreadful as matter and time. For the demiurge and his creation, it is necessary, fundamental even, that the Spirit remains tied to the soul of man. His evolutionary plan cannot do without the Spirits that are enchained to matter. However one thing is important: the demiurge wants this to remain a secret, for man never to realise that inside of him is an uncreated spark stolen from another world. So, in order to eliminate Gnostic thought about the Spirit, the agents of the demiurge on Earth came up with this ingenious idea: from the two entities, opposed and irreconcilable, they would make only one. They would take all the divine characteristics of perfection and purity from 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"the Spirit. They would only leave out Its uncreated aspect, since if man discovered he had something uncreated inside of him he would begin to ask questions, and that is no good. All the virtues of the Spirit would be transferred to the soul, which in this way would turn it from a satanic entity into a perfect one. Now there would be no more talk of the uncreated Spirit. Now only one entity within the human body would remain: “the divine and perfect soul created by God”. We have said that at the beginning of christianity, the first christian theologians, Saint Augustine amongst others, always referred to the body, soul and Spirit of man. But, as the years passed, this began to disappear. The Spirit was being transformed, firstly in “intellect”, then as one with the soul, until one fine day it was decided to remove It completely as a constituent part of the human being, leaving behind only body and soul. The conspiracy was a success: man forgot about the Spirit. And not only in christianity but in all the religions of the demiurge, body and soul are seen as the only constituent parts of man. Not only has the idea of something uncreated inside of man managed to be eliminated, but the idea that there is a prisoner unfairly locked up inside of him has been eliminated as well. It is better that no-one knows why the Spirit has been imprisoned, since men would start to ask questions and some could even wake up. It is better that they remain blind, discussing less dangerous issues such as football or sex. The seventh point is that, in order to falsify the Gnostic affirmation that this creation is imperfect, because the creator is an imperfect being, the conspirators had to sharpen their satanic wit even more. The imperfection of 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"everything in this world is something so obvious and noticeable that it cannot be denied. No matter how stupefied men become, they will never admit that this world is a paradise. So what is the solution? How can we justify that “a perfect demiurge” created such a monstrosity? Furthermore, Gnostics opposed the erroneous creation, created by a plagiarizing and inefficient demiurge, against the uncreated and eternal kingdom of the True God. What can be done to get rid of these dangerous ideas? A solution occurred to the conspirators which would abolish the idea of the uncreated and perfect world and at the same time give grounds to these suspicions of an inexperienced demiurge who created the world. This solution would also be useful to justify that which cannot be hidden: the impurity and imperfection of the created world. What deception did they sketch out this time? We will examine this issue now. The conspirators stated that all the features which characterize the kingdom of the Unknowable God were transferred to the creation of the demiurge, not to this creation however, but a previous one. To a so-called creation of the demiurge which was indeed perfect and pure. In other words the demiurge, who had become perfect, was also capable of creating a perfect and pure world. Now, we find that there is no longer a place for the Unknowable God and his kingdom, whilst the demiurge, having become perfect, is accomplishing perfect work. But, how did all that perfect creation come to be transformed into something as imperfect as it is today? Here lies the brilliance of the apostles in the deception: it was man’s fault that creation became impure and imperfect. The creator, a perfect being, created the world perfect, but man 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"ruined it. Paradise was perfect but man and the Serpent Lucifer destroyed this perfection, “falling” with it. So, we have a good and perfect creator who accomplished good and perfect work. All his creation, matter, time, man, were good. Paradise was a perfect place and man lived there happily. All this went wrong and deteriorated due to the disobedience of man. To state that man is to blame for the “original sin” and for the “fall” has been one of the crudest ideas conceived against the Spirit and the True God. Man has been held responsible for the incompetence of the creator and the shortcomings of his work! We have already seen that man was nothing more than an ignorant servant in paradise. He ignored everything concerning himself and his creator, as it appears he still is doing. He did not know that another God existed who was immensely superior to the creator god. He did not know that beyond his body and soul he had a Spirit imprisoned. He did not even know until he woke up and was able to rebel. For Gnosis, the only “original sin” that existed was that committed by the demiurge on binding the Eternal Spirits to the mortal soul of man. For Gnosis, the only “fall” that existed, and helped along by the demiurge, was the fall of the Spirits in the hellish world of matter. We have reviewed the seven principle hidden issues and misrepresentations carried out against Gnosis by the servants of the demiurge on Earth. Now we will take a look at the means used by these conspirators to better impose their falsifications. The aim is to eliminate all knowledge which refers to the uncreated, the awakening of man, the liberation of the Spirits and the rebellion against the demiurge. This 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"uncreated knowledge is Gnosis, extremely dangerous for the Universal Satanic Dictatorship. Gnostic knowledge should be eliminated because it represents the biggest threat to the demiurge and his work. Its motto is the following: everything that opposes the system created by the demiurge must be destroyed, and that which cannot be eliminated must be distorted and corrupted until it becomes unrecognisable. Stalin, agent of the demiurge, said: “If you cannot strangle your enemy, embrace him”. This is how the reforming agents of the demiurge operate against Gnosis. If something cannot be forbidden it is embraced, surrounded, in order to suffocate it, transforming it into something harmless. And not only harmless, knowledge thus neutralised and transformed is very often put to work to serve the demiurge himself. This is the case with religions which in the beginning were revolutionary and opposed to the demiurge, and after being infiltrated and distorted were placed in his service, each one being converted into another demiurgic religion. This is the case for example with christianity, buddhism and tantrism, amongst others. They were converted into religions perfectly opposed to that which they were in the beginning. It is about trying to ensure that no knowledge can remain outside the dictatorial control of the demiurge and that no element coming from the uncreated world can put the demiurge’s work or plans in danger. Something that continues to happen is the burning of dangerous books. Of course this is done in secret these days. Times have changed and in modern “democratic” dictatorships the destruction of books is carried out surreptitiously. Books are not burnt in public nowadays but are bought 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"individually and delivered to some agent or religious authority who then destroys them. Whenever possible, entire editions are bought for that purpose and the same happens with the copyrights. There are other methods, but I am only describing what I have been reliably able to prove. I have a long list of books and authors who have suffered this fate, whose books do not figure in the “official” lists of condemned or missing books. The authors of these books are usually persecuted or punished as well. It is very common for them to be threatened, intimidated or persecuted in different ways. Theft of manuscripts occurs frequently, sabotage during printing, etc. Many authors have had their reputations tarnished, been imprisoned or taken to mental institutions for having written books opposed to the demiurgic system, and not only in communist countries, since the same thing happens in “democratic” dictatorships. Many recalcitrant authors have died mysteriously of strange illnesses or accidents, never fully investigated. Nowadays the killing squads of the demiurge have extremely efficient means at their disposal for covering up their murders. Such has generally been the destiny of the great rebels and opponents of the demiurge and his work. In this created world the demiurge and his agents have everything to gain, since this is his kingdom: the kingdom of the demiurge. This kingdom is quite the opposite for a Gnostic: the enemy ground where he must act. Absolutely everything created will be against him. The war of a Gnostic will therefore have to be the same way: total. Let us take the case of Mani, the great Gnostic master who founded the Manichean religion, to which Saint Augustine belonged for nine years. Mani really existed; he is not a mythical character from another demiurgic religion. 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Fearing that his teachings were being distorted, Mani wrote several books which for centuries were persecuted, destroyed and hidden. When they were thought to be lost forever, a whole Manichean library was found in China in the 20th century. It was a miracle just like that of Nag Hammadi. They had been hidden for almost one thousand five hundred years. Mani, who never gave up on his preaching, was persecuted, imprisoned and tortured to death by priests of the demiurge in ancient Persia. One version says that Mani was skinned alive. They tore off his skin and filled it with straw in order to exhibit it at the city gates as a warning to the enemies of the creator god. Another version states that Mani was skinned after death. Tightly bound in chains, he survived twenty-six days of intense suffering and then died. It is because of all this that people talk about “the crucifixion of Mani”. But Mani was not an average man; he freed himself while he was alive. Torture and death cannot affect those who have fulfilled their Spirit; on the contrary, it makes them laugh. Let us take another case, of which there are many, that of Zeno of Elea. Imprisoned and tied up, Zeno, whilst being tortured, said to his torturer: “Come close and I will whisper everything you want to know”. When the torturer came closer Zeno bit off his ear. The torturer, in a fit of rage, told Zeno that he would torture him even more until he forced him to give up his ideas. Zeno replied in the following way: he bit off his own tongue and threw it at the torturer’s feet. How could it come to be believed that it would matter to a man like Zeno, Spiritually fulfilled, what could happen to his body and soul! Zeno’s torturer could only have been a poor clown. This is how the Warriors of the Spirit are; 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"they would rather endure torture and death than give up their ideas. In the great dictatorship of the demiurge and his conmen, there is another type of threat: punishment given by the demiurge himself. Sacred books of the demiurge’s religions are full of these warnings: the punishment of Adam and Eve, the Great Flood, Sodom and Gomorrah, the tower of Babel, the plagues of Egypt and many more. What use is punishment, apart from to eliminate opponents? Why so many threats and warnings? The answer is simple: to instil fear. Fear of punishment makes slaves work harder and give up trying to escape. A slave who is afraid is more obedient and submissive. Fear of punishment is the means used by the demiurge to make man live subject to him, obeying his commandments all his life. For the demiurge, the best slave is the one who is afraid of him and obeys him most dutifully. He wants his slaves to waste their lives working for his cause, thinking “when I die I will go to heaven”. This is the perfect slave for the demiurge. He wants man to grow old without rebelling, without waking up, without liberating his Spirit. That is the reason for the fear and that is the reason for the Conspiracy: so that nobody can ever find the Path of Liberation and Return . In the dictatorship of the demiurge, man only has freedom to choose between several things which are the same. The same, but with different disguises. There is always freedom of thought as long as it does not contradict the “politically correct way of thinking”, imposed by the representatives of the demiurge. Let us take the case of religions. They all appear to be different but they are not. They are the same thing, only their appearance is different. Their god is the same: the 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"creator of the world. They call him Brahma, Baal, Yahve, Jehovah, Moloch, the Lord God or Allah, but it is always the same: the demiurge. They try to give a false impression of diversity, so that the sleeping man thinks there are a variety of paths, with different destinies and freedom to choose between them. There are even men who change from one religion to the other, believing that by doing so they are making a great change. It took Rene Guenon, for example, years of study and meditation to make the decision to abandon christianity and join masonry and martinism, only to give it all up at a later date and convert to islam. He thought he had made great leaps with these changes, but the only thing he did was to go round in circles inside his labyrinth. His search was in vain. And if Guenon, well-learned in these subjects, experienced such confusion, one can imagine the mistakes the average man will make. The case of Saint Augustine is even more pathetic. He was a follower of Mani, an auditor or hearer, and on the point of meeting Mani in person, he resolved to abandon everything and convert to christianity. With his apostasy, Augustine rejected the Unknowable and the Spirit, opting for the demiurge and the soul. He resisted the radical asceticism of Manichaeism to immerse himself in the new popular and imperial religion of Constantine: christianity. There are people who are half-awake who, afraid of spending their lives sleeping, are desperately looking for a way out of the labyrinth in which they are trapped. Unfortunately, most of them ignore that the options appearing in front of them are all the same thing, only with different disguises. The aim of all this is for them never to find the way out or realise that religions, like political parties, are the same thing with different faces, all under the 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"demiurge’s control. A few years ago the Dalai Lama said that there should not be only one religion, but a “supermarket of religions”. This is the best way of making man believe he is surrounded by a diversity of options and that when he makes a choice he will get something different to the rest. The aim of these religions is to keep man asleep, leading him blindly to the final slaughterhouse: his fusion with the demiurge . 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"18. LIGHT AND DARKNESS For thousands of years Hindus have maintained that all creation, everything created, is maya , pure illusion, a trick. Seen through the eyes of the Spirit, all the work of the demiurge does not really exist and is nothing more than a big lie. The created world, as perceived by the senses, is the great obstacle which separates man from the real world. Man is not only misled by delusions of matter. The delusion of matter, created by the demiurge, has to be joined to the delusion of culture, created by man but at the service of the demiurge. All cultural stimuli, with which man is continuously bombarded, tend to keep him in a state of confusion and meekness. Books, newspapers, magazines, cinema and television are some of the means used by the representatives of the demiurge to keep man hypnotized and obedient and to make sure he carries on acting like a sleepwalker, working, sleeping, wasting time and missing opportunities; never to wake up, just like perfect zombies or golems of the demiurge, serving a purpose which is not that of the Spirit. All this mass confusion, this great maya which comes from creation and which is carried on by means of culture, is passed on in turn by fathers to their young children and later by teachers in schools. In this way, the slightest hint of the Spirit is annihilated from the day man is born. All rebellion, disobedience, opposition and all that comes from 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80 the Spirit is annihilated through punishment, threats and brainwashing. By transforming their children into machines of blind obedience, the satanic parents are forming the future slaves of the demiurge. In the middle of all this mass confusion, man thinks he knows what is good and what is evil. He also thinks that by doing what is called “good” and avoiding what is called “evil” he is completely fulfilling his duty. He does not know how confused he is, that he is living a lie, that he is continually deceiving himself and others. He does not know because he is asleep, because he has been brainwashed and because his Spirit has been nullified since birth. Most men call light that which is true darkness, and they perceive True Light as darkness. They call everything satanic originating from the demiurge “good” and everything which originates from the Unknowable God “evil”. There are two opposing forces at work within and outside of man: the creator and the Unknowable, the created and the uncreated, the soul and the Spirit. One of these represents evil and darkness and the other Good and Light. It is easy to imagine what the stance of a Gnostic and that of a sleeping man would be. It is said that the whole history of mankind can be explained as the fight between light and darkness but what light and what darkness? Most people are not aware that they are spending their lives struggling in favour of true evil. What man calls light is the light created by the demiurge, since man does not know any light superior to it. It is the light which comes from the created world and which, for the Spirit, is unfathomable darkness. Darkness, which comes from the demiurge and his demonic creation, is what man calls light. Man calls Truth the Great Lie, the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Great Deception, that which we can call the Great Mockery. There is another Light, superior, inconceivable, unknowable: the Uncreated Light which comes from the kingdom of the True and Unknown God. What would happen if this Light burst into this impure universe? Man would go almost blind. What would he see? Would he see a light? No, he would see the night. His eyes are not ready to see this infinitely pure and perfect Light. He would be frightened, fearing, and rightly so, that he would be destroyed by the Light. So he would call this Light “evil”, “darkness”, which happens with everything seen through the eyes of the impure, the body and soul of man, and not through the eyes of the Spirit. This is the confusion between darkness and Light, the same confusion that exists between the creator god and the Unknowable God, between the created and the Uncreated, between the soul and the Spirit. That is why man unwittingly calls true darkness light and True Light darkness. True Light would blind and destroy him. If man could withstand the vision of True Light without dying, he would only see unfathomable darkness, because he would be seeing the True Light . 81"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"19. THE BLACK AND WHITE LODGES Much has been said lately about the white lodge and the black lodge. The beings that form these lodges work in other dimensional planes, which are invisible to the common man. It is said that the white lodge is formed from supposedly highly evolved beings, who try to help man evolve, in agreement with the Grand Plan which the creator god set aside for his material creation and his creatures. As this lodge is trying to help man, so he can satisfactorily fulfil his function within the plan of creation, it is called “white lodge” or “white brotherhood”. It would be something like “the good lodge of good beings of light”. On the other hand, we can already imagine who the members of the black lodge are: those who are opposed to the plan of the creator god, those who are trying to prevent this plan from being carried out. This is the black lodge, the “bad guys of the film”. We should make it clear that we are using the term “black lodge” to avoid confusion, because that is how it is commonly known, having been given that name by the agents of the demiurge. The representatives of the Spirit would never form a “lodge”. Its true name is the Black Order. The white lodge works in favour of the creator god and his plan, whereas the black lodge works against it. For that reason, members of the black lodge are called “the mistaken brothers”, because “being able to help with 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"construction they decided to destroy” and “being able to do good, they opted for evil”. When it is stated that the members of the black lodge are opposed to the “perfect plan of a good demiurge”, the effect is a rejection and a natural aversion to these “enemies of the good”. That which has deliberately been hidden for centuries is that these “enemies of the only god” do not oppose the work of this creator just for the sake of it. The fact that they have another god, who is not the devil but the Superior and True God, has been hidden. The struggle to make the demiurge’s plans fail is the sacred task of these warriors of the True Good and this has been hidden. It has been hidden that the Unknowable God also has a plan, infinitely brilliant and perfect. And all this has been concealed from us to better deceive us and to better discredit and slander the Warriors of the Spirit, so that we cannot wake up and so that we cannot be “like god, knowing good and evil”. There is a war which started with the Big Bang, thousands of millions of years ago, between these two forces of darkness and Light, between the creator god and the Unknowable God. The white and black lodges are their respective armies. Since this is the world of the demiurge, he is the one who decides who to call white and who to call black. The world of the demiurge is also the battlefield where this war is fought. How are these “masters of wisdom” of the white lodge commonly represented? They are represented as angelic and kind, bearded and wearing white, as if they were pure and immaculate. They are represented like this in order to better deceive the gullible. So that no-one suspects that these are the real demons, in charge of carrying out the satanic plan of the demiurge. So that no-one suspects that these deceivers of man are the ones trying to make sure that 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"mankind carries on blindly, advancing towards Spiritual death. So that no-one ever finds out that these executioners of the Spirit are those who desire that each man were one more cog in the wheel, one more machine, one more link. One more ant in the Universal Communist Anthill which the satan-demiurge has set aside as the final destiny of mankind. It is said that at the end of each man’s evolution, if he has lost the battle of the Spirit and cannot fight any more, that is when he will see the true faces of these false “masters” of the white lodge. In the last hundred and fifty years, these members of the white lodge have started to be described, each time with more clarity. Their names, appearances and characteristics can be found in books by Helena Blavatsky and in books by those who followed her, Alice Bailey being the one who stands out. We have spoken about one of the members of the white lodge: Satan Kumara. What a name! It was just too much and had to be disguised later on, changing it to Sanat Kumara. Each one of them, like the demiurge, has many names, many disguises to better deceive. Some of them have the real names of demons, like Maitreya, who is said to be “the real Christ”, or the “masters” Morya and Dwall Khul. Others have noble titles such as “Prince” Rakotzy, a true “Prince” of the darkness. There are many more, all similar. All these demons, empty eggshells of the demiurge, will be disintegrated in the pralaya along with everything created. On the other hand, members of the black lodge are represented as terrible monstrous beings. In what other way could they be represented in the world of the demiurge? They are called “messengers of Satan” or “agents of the Malign”. They are represented as destructive monsters, 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 usually dressed in black to better confuse the gullible. Leaving aside the lies which have been invented to better discredit them, let us now analyze some characteristics of the warriors of the black lodge. Firstly, what appearance could a divine being, a Being of Light who enters this hell, have? Certainly not a happy face but one full of pain, disfigured by all the suffering. The sacrifice of Beings of Light, who invade the world of the demiurge to help men who have lost their way, involves the worst suffering imaginable. Secondly, what colour did we say a sleeping man perceives the Uncreated Light? The darkest black of course, because True Light blinds the impure man. To be represented in black is an honour for a Warrior of the Spirit, because black signifies pure Light, blinding Light, True Light. Thirdly, how do these Beings of Light behave when they burst into the demiurge’s universe? When the warriors of the black lodge infiltrate this created hell, they do so for a limited time, to carry out a precise mission and then to get out as quickly as possible. They have no time to waste, since this impure world is an inconceivable torment for them. On reaching the great demented monstrosity of the demiurge, the right thing to do is to hit the exact spot where it hurts and escape. For those coming from the unknowable world, the war against the created is a Total War. For them, nothing created deserves to be saved. If a common man could see these beings, he would be scared by their aggressiveness and destructiveness. He would perceive them as dangerous enemies, like the beings imagined by Lovecraft, or those in films such as “Hellraiser” or “Predator”. Viewing reality through his body and soul, the common man sees the pure as impure"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"and his saviours as enemies. Warriors of the Spirit loathe matter. They are indeed destroyers, but destroyers of the impure . If a common man came face to face with these beings, all that was impure within him, his body and soul would be disintegrated. These beings are formed from the antimatter fire of the other world; therefore not a single created atom can collide with them without disappearing. If these warriors were to approach a common man, they would destroy his body and soul, although not his Spirit, which is made from pure fire, just like them. Only the absurd aspects would be destroyed, the sick part, that which imprisons the Spirit, the coffin which encases It: the body and soul of the animal wrongly called man . On the other hand, men transmuted into pure Spirit will never be afraid of anything. They can indeed see reality such as it is. They can indeed discriminate correctly between Good and evil. They can indeed see the members of the black lodge as they really are. They know that the antimatter fire only destroys the created, not the uncreated. The Spirit is not afraid of death, simply because as far as the Spirit is concerned, death does not exist, because the Spirit is eternal. And the day everything that is garbage is destroyed, that is to say, the day on which all creation and its creator are disintegrated, when nothing remains, not even a single atom, body or soul, only the Spirits will remain, freed forever. Now there will be no more duality and the world will go back to being one and only one: the Unknowable Eternal Fire . 87"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"20. REBELLIOUSNESS AND OPPOSITION Gnostics, having outlined the absolute and irreconcilable differences between the creator god and the Unknowable God, consider the god who created the world as something completely inferior to the True and Unknown God. It is natural therefore that they maintain that all the laws and orders of the god who created the universe and man must be disobeyed, because that is not the word of the True God but that of the other, the imposter, the inferior and inept one. For Gnostics, all that exists in sacred religious books is not the word of the True and Unknowable God, but that of the creator god or demiurge. His commandments, which he wants man to obey, such as how they should interact and how they should worship and serve him, appear in those books. Gnostics conclude then that if those laws are those of the demiurge, they can and must be disobeyed . Gnostics oppose in advance everything that comes from the demiurge on principle. All that the creator says, orders and demands must be disobeyed, because he is not the True God but an imposter who considers himself to be “the Only One” . Seen from the outside and on a superficial level by an average man, this Gnostic position appears to be an abominable rebelliousness. The common man imagines that a good god created man, loves him, wants to help him, 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"has high hopes for him and needs him in order to perfect and complete his work. The common man would view this Gnostic position against “the good father who brought him into the world” with horror. Man, the best of all the creatures that god created, would be rebelling against him, opposing and renouncing him. How awful! But what the common man does not know is everything that we have said up to now concerning the “good father” and his works and plans. For Gnosis, the rebellion against the demiurge does not only free man from his slavery and servitude, it also weakens and takes away power from the demiurge. Through his constant opposition, the Gnostic gradually acquires a power equal then later superior to that of the creator god . If man were only a body and a soul, if those two entities created by the demiurge were the only things that man were made from, of course there would never be any rebellion at all. Nothing created rebels against its creator. What happens is that there is something in man which was not created by the creator god: the Eternal Spirit . The Spirit has been brought from outside and does not belong to this world. It has been added to the monstrosity which is body- soul, to make it function and evolve. But It was put there against Its will and finds Itself imprisoned in matter. It is the Spirit which rebels. It is not rebelling against Its creator but against the one who imprisoned It. Take note: this rebellion comes from the Spirit. It is the uncreated in man which loathes and opposes the creator satan and his work . A Gnostic man, one who has transformed himself into his own Spirit, one whose Spirit has freed Itself and takes possession of his body and soul to use them as instruments, 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"will be a great rebel and adversary of the demiurge and his work. His actions will be imposing and devastating, just like every liberated Spirit. And as in the case of Cain, the demiurge will have no power over him. On the other hand, a man who is half-asleep will be semi-rebellious. He will blindly search for a way out. He will almost unconsciously be opposed to the created world which surrounds and suffocates his Spirit. His semi- conscious attitude will not allow a rebellion or opposition capable of putting the demiurge or his work in danger. We have said that during the process of liberating the Spirit, man acquires a power equal and then superior to that of the creator god. We have also said that rebellion and opposition, powerful and sustained, weaken the demiurge and take away his power. This takes us to the four possible positions regarding the idea man can have of the creator god. The first position is: the demiurge exists. The god who created heaven and earth exists. The second position is: the demiurge does not exist. This is atheism. The creator god does not exist. All that exists is a product of the blind evolution of matter. These first two positions, god exists/god does not exist are the traditional positions in the history of mankind. It was always thought that there could not be a third position but along came Nietzsche and declared that “god has died”. This is the third idea that a man can have of the creator god: god used to exist, but now he is dead. This idea appears to be somewhere in the middle of the god exists/god does not exist position. The fourth position is my Gnostic position: the creator god exists, but he must be eliminated by man . This last position appears to be the one which has 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"caused the most horror, judging by the way it has been persecuted and hidden. Gnostics maintain that the creator must be trapped and weakened, in such a way that he cannot create anything else and finally disappears. The duality of worlds must be eliminated by man so there will be only one kingdom: that of the Unknowable God . Gnostics maintain that the attacks must be aimed at the creator god, to break the endless return of manvantaras and pralayas, of experimental trial and error in this Great Plagiarism which will never attain perfection. If an atomic chain reaction destroyed everything created, the demiurge would create it all again. That is why for Gnosis it is the creator god who must be defeated and eliminated. In an interesting film called “Warlock”, a witch, who is the “bad guy”, tries to find the exact words with which the demiurge created the world. Pronouncing this formula backwards would make all creation disappear. This is not a bad idea but rather a possible waste of time: if it happened like this the demiurge would create it all again. Another important theme is suicide. Suicide would appear to be a rebellion against the creator, but it is not. Those who think that suicide is a means of escaping from the clutches of the demiurge are wrong. When a man begins to wake up and starts to see things as they really are, he fears he has gone mad. He realizes that everything he has been taught is lies, that he is surrounded by madmen and sleepwalkers and that he is stuck in a giant concentration camp inhabited by the insane. If this man does not quickly find other men who are awake like him, it is likely he will think about committing suicide in an effort to escape from this prison. That is why most men prefer to remain asleep. Most of them do not want to know the truth: that they are living in a huge mental 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"institution invented and controlled by the Supreme Madman . Only a minority of very brave men will seek out this Special Knowledge capable of waking them up. We have seen that attempting to destroy the work of the demiurge is useless, since he will only create it again. In the same way then, suicide is also a mistake, a useless rebellion, and in this case the complete opposite of liberation. When the common man commits suicide, his soul is separated from his body and delivered to the demiurge, taking the Spirit with it, as the Spirit is tied to the soul. Next comes judgment, punishment and karma. This is what happens every time a man dies, and suicide is no exception. In the case of suicide, the punishment inflicted by the demiurge will be greater: a prisoner has tried to escape and has been trapped again. Double punishment. The prisoner who has committed suicide, has not escaped from anything and has liberated himself from nothing. Here he is, in the hands of the demiurge once again. For the common man, suicide is neither a way out nor liberation. On the contrary, it is a worsening of his situation. But in the case of a man who has fulfilled his Spirit, everything is different, since he is not a common man anymore. He is a man who has escaped from the prison of the demiurge. The demiurge and his punishment cannot reach him now. The laws of karma do not exist for him now. He has transformed himself by his own free will, into something uncreated within the created world and he can do whatever he wants, including committing suicide. His impure body and soul have been deified by the Spirit and no longer belong to the demiurge. His body, soul and Spirit have been converted into only one thing: something indestructible, immortal and eternal . For this 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94 type of man, suicide is simply a way of moving from one point in the universe to another, or from one dimension to another. This type of man is the one who is described in the christian myth. It is said that when they went to look for the body of Christ they could not find it, the tomb was empty. Of course, since the Spirit had taken the body and soul with It! After “death”, the Spiritualized body and soul, transformed into one inseparable unit with the Spirit, leave along with It. Let us look at an example of a famous suicide now that we are talking about christianity. That of Judas, the man who betrayed Jesus Christ. A common man, uninformed and confused, would say that Judas is a monster, that it was his fault Jesus Christ was crucified. Judas is the bad guy of this story. Who could like Judas? However for Gnostics, Judas is a hero, a benefactor of mankind, who, through his betrayal, helped Jesus Christ’s mission to be carried out. A “Gospel of Judas” even existed, which narrated all these events from his point of view. You can already imagine what happened to this gospel. According to Gnostics, Judas came to help Christ with his mission. Judas’s betrayal is what led directly to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The death of the Messiah redeemed the world. The redeeming death of the Saviour would not have occurred without Judas. Without Judas, christianity would not have succeeded as a religion. How different the history of man would have been if Judas, “the best of the Lord’s disciples”, had not existed. What could it have mattered to Judas the fact that future generations would say that he was a monster? Such is the destiny of heroes, of great men, here in the hell of the demiurge! Judas knew without a doubt that he would later"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"be spoken about badly, that he would be mercilessly discredited and hated and despised by everyone. But what could this have mattered to someone who came to carry out an essential mission, and together with no less than one of the saviours of the world? That is why Christ said to Judas: “Judas, what you have to do, do it quickly”. His “betrayal” was fundamental for the future of christianity. What could Judas do after successfully carrying out his mission? He had to abandon the world of the demiurge, since he had no business being here any more. Having completed his mission, he had to return to his home in the unknowable world. Judas committed suicide. Traditionally we are told that Judas made his way to a tree and hanged himself. Having completed his mission, a Warrior of the Spirit can resort to suicide as a way of quickly leaving the hell of the demiurge. He can do it because he does not belong to this world and, as we have said, neither the creator nor his laws have any power over him. The suicide of a warrior, a superman of the Spirit, is one thing and the suicide of a sleeping man is something else. This is why Judas’ suicide is not the same as that of a common man, who despairs over the slightest thing in the world of matter and then one fine day kills himself. Gnostics state that the tree on which Judas hanged himself, was no other than the tree of Eden. 95"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"21. GNOSTIC INITIATION Initiation is a ceremony, usually a group action, in which secret knowledge is transmitted to an aspirant which will produce great changes in him. Once initiated, the aspirant will never be the same again. When an initiation is real, is true, it is a turning point in the aspirant’s life. There is a before and after as regards the initiation, because something has occurred in this ceremony which has changed his life in a spectacular way, something he will never be able to forget. I have known people who received initiations in different places, but on no occasion did they notice anything special. Without a doubt, these were not true initiations. But when someone receives a true initiation, his experience is in fact very striking and he will never forget it. Some compare this experience to that of having been struck by a kind of lightning flash in the middle of the ceremony. This “lightning flash” is what produces the terrible change which will mark the aspirant’s life forever. Now he will never again go back to being what he had been before. For the rest of his life he will remain focused on the goal, the specific objective of the initiation received. Every man, sooner or later will have to choose one of the only two paths, opposing and irreconcilable, open to him: fulfilment of his soul or fulfilment of his Spirit. There is no third possibility. The path of the right hand towards 97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"the demiurge by means of perfection of the soul, or the Path of the Left Hand, towards the Unknowable God, by means of liberation of the Spirit . The latter is what makes up the particular goal or objective of an initiation, and that is why there are only initiations of the soul or initiations of the Spirit. The purpose of both is to facilitate the candidate’s access towards the destiny he has chosen. It is important to know the main characteristics of both kinds of initiations, in order to differentiate accurately between one and the other. Many people who are unaware of these details fall into traps which will lead them directly into the jaws of the demiurge. It is easy to make a mistake since there are disguises and falsifications to consider as well as lack of books and information. Let us have a look at those things it is necessary to take into account to be able to reject the poisoned fruit offered to us by the servants of the demiurge. Firstly, the objective of the initiations of the soul is the final merging with the demiurge. This is of prime importance. If someone talks to us about “the union with God”, “losing oneself in God”, “the fusion of the individual conscience with the One Conscience”, samadhi (dissolution in the demiurge), etc., we will know that we are dealing with a religion, sect or esoteric movement which the demiurge is behind. Of course the initiations that can be granted there will be initiations of the soul and not of the Spirit. On the other hand, in initiations of the Spirit, the aim will never be a fusion with any god. At the end of the path, when the total confrontation with the demiurge occurs, the initiate will have to resist and reject him, exclude him and exclude himself forever. In these cases, it is not about samadhi, but kaivalya : absolute separation. But special 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"kaivalya, not only total separation with respect to everything created by the demiurge. No. Real kaivalya inevitably includes total and absolute separation from the demiurge himself . Secondly, in initiations which lead to the demiurge, the aim is to weaken the self of the aspirant, and to push him to renounce to it. Every religious movement which works in favour of the demiurge will give great importance to the need to destroy the self of the aspirants. For fusion with the demiurge to be successful, it is fundamental that the aspirant renounces his self. Once the self has been disintegrated, the empty shell into which the initiate has been converted will be quickly filled by the demiurge. This man has surrendered himself to the demiurge like a sacrificial animal, has attained nothingness and the nothingness has been filled by the demiurge. The goal of the demiurge has been achieved; this man has come a long way to end up by dissolving himself in the one who created him. On the other hand, in initiations of the Spirit, the aim is always the enlargement of the self and the accumulation of power. Enlarging the self is to get close to the Spirit. If the self does not exist, the Spirit cannot manifest Itself. Renouncing the self is to renounce the Spirit. Thirdly, in initiations of the soul there are talks about evolution, the future and progress. “The soul has to evolve until it is fused with God”. “All creation evolves towards God”. “Mankind will continue to evolve until it becomes a universal communion of souls”. “The world gets better every day.” On the contrary, in initiations of the Spirit there are talks about return and the past. The world is heading towards its deterioration and destruction. There is nothing 99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"good to look forward to in the future. The restoration of Something that there was in the past is essential. In order to repair the Great Injustice carried out by the demiurge and his conmen, it is necessary to go back to that past to deactivate everything, to liberate that which has to be liberated and to destroy that which has to be destroyed. Fourthly, in initiations of the soul one will hear talk of compassion, devotion, love, generosity and service. Compassion for all beings created by the demiurge. Love for the demiurge and for other men. “Love of everything that the Breath of Divine Life has brought into existence” (this “Breath of Divine Life” is no other than the breath of the demiurge). Service is about serving other men and the “masters” of the white lodge and the demiurge, “to restore the Plan on Earth”. Also emphasised are blame and regret. On the other hand, in initiations of the Spirit, the candidate is like a warrior who has declared total war on the forces of matter. One does not hear talk of peace but swords, the fight for freedom and taking the Heavens by assault. It is not about love, devotion, blame nor regret but duty, honour and revenge. One has to take into account that as the aspirant is Spiritualising, aggressiveness and repulsion for all that is anti-Spiritual and impure, material and created, increase within him. This is the natural hostility of the Spirit towards the demiurge and his work. If the Spirit felt love for the demiurge and his creation, it would not be a Spirit, it would be a soul. The soul is pure love (for the demiurge and his work). The Spirit is pure hate (for the demiurge and his work) . The details which we have stated here allow us to better identify which side these people or religious groups which pretend to help others are on. When we listen to them or read their books we will know straight away if they are 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"with God or with the devil. In this era of darkness in which one only hears talk of the “fulfilment of the soul”, of “the powers of the soul”, of the “perfection of the soul”, it is good to remember that, although persecuted and denied, liberation and fulfilment of the Spirit also exist . Once the two possible kinds of initiation have been identified we will go on to take a look at its other characteristics. In Gnostic initiations, the person receives certain secret knowledge. This is not any knowledge but that which produces noticeable changes in the aspirant. It is about special knowledge which has the power to transform the one who listens to it. This type of knowledge is of the utmost importance for a Gnostic (we have already seen that this is the meaning of Gnosis: knowledge). For every Gnostic, salvation is not achieved through faith but through knowledge. This secret knowledge, transmitted during initiation, is not the end of the path but the start. This knowledge has the power to wake up and urge the candidate on to his final goal: liberation of the Spirit. Once received and studied, this knowledge gradually transforms the initiate, in stages. To attain the radical change desired, the final transmutation by the Spirit, the initiate will have to fight constantly and tirelessly. The memory and impact of the initiation will give him strength so that he never gives up or forgets his goal. In an old Gnostic work, recovered recently and given the title “Trimorphic Protennoia”, it is said that initiation is an experience of knowledge which brings spiritual fulfilment. It is also said that it is a process of ascension which is defeat of the cosmos and consolidation of that which is true (the cosmos is the work of the demiurge and that which is true is the Spirit). It speaks of knowledge 101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"which liberates and purifies, men who seek the world of the Spirit, and of men who walk in matter. It speaks of initiations in stages which gradually purify and smooth the path of ascent towards the Spirit. In this book, the demiurge is called “the great demon”. There are usually three initiations. After the changes produced by the first initiation and when he is considered to be prepared, the initiate will receive the second initiation which will produce other kinds of changes in him. Then the third initiation will be carried out which will completely smooth the path to his final transmutation. Another characteristic of initiations is that they can be individual or group. Up to now we have spoken about individual initiations, when a man decides to pass through the threshold and be initiated. In the second case it is now a people or an entire community whose members seek out this transformation as one. These cases are even more rare but there have been several throughout the course of history. Another situation is self-initiation when the candidate feels he is ready and decides to initiate himself. There is also the case of initiations received during sleep. We will be looking at these last two cases in more detail later on. How would a Gnostic initiation have been carried out in former times? All the Gnostic books which described the process have been destroyed. Let us have a look amongst the enemies of Gnosticism, who on the other hand were able to read these books. Irenaeus of Lyons was one of them. He wrote a book of five volumes called “Adversus Haereses” (against heresy). Only the first volume, which is quite easy to get hold of and in which Irenaeus mocks 102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Gnostic ideas, has been translated. The other volumes are in Greek and Latin, hidden in some library which is difficult to access. This is understandable since the second volume refers to the ideas of the great Gnostic Marcion and it is not desirable that people get to know about his ideas or read his immortal work “Antithesis” for example. The enemies of Gnosis tried to make sure that no man could be enlightened by Marcion’s work, or awakened by it; it wouldn’t be the case that one of the religions of the demiurge falls down! But the third volume, the most well-hidden, is the one which describes Gnostic initiation ceremonies. If these books against Gnosis, written by no less than Saint Irenaeus, full of slander and irony against Gnosticism, are so jealously guarded...What can we expect in the case of an authentically Gnostic book! The great scholar in Gnosticism, Elaine Pagels, had access to the third volume by Irenaeus of Lyons and in her book “The Gnostic Gospels” she describes several details of Gnostic initiation. Pagels tells us that the aspirant is aware now that before he adored and served the demiurge who up to that moment he had confused with the true God. During the initiation ceremony, the aspirant addresses the demiurge declaring his independence from him and from his creation, telling him that he now no longer belongs to his sphere of authority and that he has transcended all that. The initiate recognizes the Unknowable God, rejects the authority of the creator god and his commands, and declares that he has been forever liberated from the power of the demiurge . From this point on his relationship with the demiurge will be completely different. By means of the initiation, the initiate has radically changed his relation with the creator god. He has 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"separated himself from the demiurge and all creation. He has separated himself from his body and soul. He is now outside the laws which govern the world of matter and time. He is now outside everything, except his Spirit . Let us now return to the theme of self-initiation. There are men who have woken up a little and are desperately searching for the path of liberation of their Spirits. Those men can initiate themselves and produce the transcendental change which can lead them to the Spirit. Next I will relate the formula of self-initiation which I developed and applied to myself. At night, in bed and ready to sleep, whoever so wishes can mentally repeat the following until they fall asleep: “I want to separate myself from the creator god and his creation, I want to separate myself from matter and time, I want to separate myself from my body and soul, I want to unite myself with my Spirit, I want my Spirit to be liberated, I want to be my Spirit, I am my Spirit” . This formula of self-initiation produces incredibly striking results; however it must be applied with care. At least at the start, it is better not to practice it every night. This type of nocturnal self-initiation leads us onto the cases in which initiations are received during sleep. In these cases the aspirant moves out of his physical body and the ceremony is carried out in other dimensions of the created universe. There are initiates who have received one, two, even three initiations during sleep. Others have received the first on the physical plane and the rest outside of it. Each case is unique; there are no two the same. During the initiation ceremonies carried out during sleep, the aspirant, although far away from his physical body, is fully conscious of what is happening. 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Not only initiations of the Spirit, but also those of the soul can be received in other dimensions. In my case, I searched the world over and for many years for someone who could give me the true Gnostic initiation. In the end, I found out that person had been living all those years less then a hundred metres from my house! I had been searching distant countries for that which was within arm’s reach. When I went and knocked on his door I was told that he had left this world a short time ago. My disappointment was so great that I thought the only way to get the authentic Gnostic initiation would be to initiate myself during sleep, in other dimensions of the created world. Next I am going to relate some of the experiences that have happened to me. One night, during which I had been reading “The Green Face”, a book by Gustav Meyrink, before going to sleep I mentally repeated “I want the liberation of my Spirit” many times and then I fell asleep. Half an hour had passed when a bright light woke me up. I kept my eyes closed but could see a bright light; everything around me was light. I slowly opened my eyes and realized that this intense light filled the whole room. I thought that someone had got into my house and put the lights on. But no, the lights were out; this was a different light, a strange light that I had never seen before. Without moving, I looked around the whole room and found that the light was coming from one of the corners. A beam of light was flowing out from the corner and had already filled the room, gushing forth like a bright mist which engulfed everything. Faced with phenomena such as these we must try not to be afraid and remember that fear does not exist for the Spirit. The Spirit is not afraid of anything because It is indestructible, immortal and eternal. 105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106 Another night, after reading a few pages of the book “The Theory of Eternal Life” by Rodney Collin, I resolved to mentally repeat the words “I want to receive the initiation of the Spirit” until I fell asleep. Forty minutes later, the same light as before woke me up but now there were also two people in the room. I kept my eyes closed, but “sensed” that there were two men there, next to my bed. I thought “How could they have got in, if the doors and windows are locked and only I have the keys to the house?” I was afraid to open my eyes, afraid to look at them and afraid they would notice I had woken up. I heard a strange and powerful voice: “You called us and we have come, and now you are afraid!” I kept my eyes shut and did not reply. I wanted to escape, but I was afraid they would attack me if I tried. Next, I heard “You weren’t fully prepared” and then “There is no other way”. They immediately nailed into my head a kind of needle, without giving me time to react or defend myself. I felt that they were injecting a kind of liquid into my brain, using what appeared to me to be a kind of metal syringe or something similar. Then I fell asleep. From that day on I felt within me a sort of distance with respect to the world and I knew without a doubt exactly what the goal was to which I had to dedicate all my efforts for the rest of my life. I also noticed that my doubts and uncertainties about the most direct path to the Spirit had disappeared. Fear in a man is a sign that he is still identifying with the created world and its laws. A sign that he still loves matter, his body and soul, and does not want to lose them. For that reason his separation from everything created must be gradual. As he progresses with his Spiritualization his fear diminishes, at the same time as, as we have already said, his hostility towards the impure and the ephemeral"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"increases. This is the proof that a man is becoming close to his Spirit. Years later, I had a similar experience after mental repetitions prior to sleep. The same light and the same men appeared. This time the same voice said: “Now there is no fear”. And next they leant a strange instrument against my head which emitted some sort of laser beam. A strange rhomboid-shaped symbol was then engraved on my head by the beam. After that second experience, less invasive than the first, I noticed that I was getting closer to my Spirit without looking back or around me. The path had been completely smoothed, transformed into a direct path and now I only had to walk down it. The third initiation aims to ease and help with the final transmutation, the True Salvation. 107"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"22. TRUE LIBERATION OF THE SPIRIT With what we have said up to now, we are in a position to reply to the three fundamental questions that man rarely ever asks himself in life. These three questions are: Who am I? Why am I here? What must I do in this life? Who am I? I am an uncreated and eternal Spirit, chained up in the created and ephemeral body-soul, imprisoned in matter. Why am I here? I am here to be used as a lab animal, in a crazy insane experiment conceived by an inferior god. This plan requires an Eternal Spirit to be imprisoned, in order to use Its antimatter power to impel the evolution of this impure and mortal monstrosity called body-soul. The power of a Spirit is essential so that man can at some point achieve the final objective for which he has been created: his transformation into the demiurge. This antimatter energy, capable by itself of putting all creation in danger, is partly deactivated and diminished so as to be used safely. This is why the Spirit must be chained up and confused, so that It contributes only an extremely small part of Its potential to the sinister work of the demiurge. What must I do in this life? I must wake up. I must become aware of my real situation and find a way out. Then I must liberate myself and escape from this prison. Now that we have replied to the three questions we will take a look at what Gustav Meyrink, the great initiated 109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Gnostic who successfully went through this experience, has to say on the matter. Meyrink, in his most profound and extraordinary book “The Green Face”, gives us the key to the process of liberation of the Spirit: Let us review these issues here, because they are a perfect answer to the third question we asked regarding what we must do. Afterwards we will add various other points. Meyrink says: “The second birth is spiritual”, “the second birth is when the spirit liberates itself”, “the second spiritual birth leads us to eternal life”. Meyrink gives us a technique and recommends a practice which we should adopt: “You must ask the spirit, because the only one who can hear you is the spirit”, “you must talk to it, ask only it”. Here, Meyrink is of course relating that the Unknowable God is very far from the common man, and the demiurge, who could maybe hear him, is a judge who would never change his karmic sentences to consent to an insignificant request by an insignificant man. All that remains is to ask the Spirit. In the case of a man who has woken up and liberated himself, things are different; he indeed will be able to change wills, laws and destinies. But if a common man wants to be heard, he will have to talk to his Spirit. Meyrink says: “If you want to pray, pray to your invisible self, it is the only God who will listen to your prayers”. He also adds: “If you want to speed things up, ask your spirit to lead you to the great goal via the shortest path, and it will do so”. So, to progress towards this “great goal”, you don’t have to look back, or around you or get distracted; the attention must not be swayed by the many temptations in the world. You must keep your eyes and will fixed on that great goal. Meyrink has given us some good ideas which we can 110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"put into practice at night. Once in bed and ready to sleep we can mentally repeat sentences similar to the following: “I want to unite myself with you, Eternal Spirit”, “I want to wake up”, “lead me to the Great Goal”. Without fail, the following morning we will notice changes. But very few men speak to their Spirit! Yet most of them sleep like a log! For Meyrink, “the liberation of the spirit is the only worthwhile thing a man can do in life, it is the only task that he should perform, there is no other single which justifies spending time on, all the rest are useless, this is the only task, indeed the most important one, to which a man can dedicate his life”. As the Spirit is liberated, the body and soul of man are Spiritualized by It. This is Meyrink’s “great goal”, that the Spirit transforms the body, that the body is Spiritualized and is transmuted by the Spirit. How awful it would be for the demiurge if this happened! He created the body and soul of man for another purpose: for them to resemble him, to transform into him. And now man ends up transforming into Spirit! Not only has the prisoner freed himself but furthermore he is taking possession of a piece of the demiurge’s work! The demiurge created man so that he would evolve until he is transformed into a manifestation channel of himself, his creator! And suddenly man is transforming into a manifestation instrument of the Spirit! The liberated Spirit is snatching away his most important work and spoiling his plans. The demiurge created man so that he would admire and adore him, and the opposite has happened: the body and soul of man have been transformed by the Spirit into terrible opponents of the creator and his work. Meyrink says that as man is being transformed, he becomes aware of the absurdity of everything. He 111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"gradually notices that other men are nothing more than spectres and ghosts, and that he himself has always been one too. A man transformed in this way feels the most awful solitude imaginable. But slowly he will adapt himself to this new state, he will overcome all the inferior qualities and the solitude he felt at the start, and will arrive in a new kingdom: wakefulness. Meyrink says that “wakefulness is the awakening of the immortal and eternal self”. Man has woken up and now there is no sleep for him. He is in a state of permanent wakefulness, like Cain, the Immortal. Only the man who has woken up and is Spiritualized becomes immortal and eternal, and not even the pralaya will be able to destroy him. But all this does not happen on its own; it is only a remote possibility. A supreme effort will have to be made to achieve it. Meyrink adds that when a Spirit is liberated, all creation is liberated a little. When a body and soul are Spiritualized and transmuted by the Spirit, all creation is Spiritualized to some extent. We say that the Supreme Gnostic Work affects the cosmos. Meyrink says the following: “if one man is profoundly transformed, his work will never die; he will have opened a hole which will never be closed again. Although the others do not realize it, he will have ripped apart the net which keeps mankind a prisoner. According to Meyrink, when the Spirit takes control, the man thus transformed can live in various dimensions at the same time, since he has altered space and time. He is a king in these worlds, he has made himself a king of all this creation, he can transport himself from one place to another or he can be in various different places at the same time. Such is the power of the Spirit. This is where our review of Meyrink’s main Gnostic 112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"ideas ends. Now we will take a look at what Primordial Gnosis tells us about this process of liberation of the Spirit. In order to start the process, man must choose one of his selves, the strongest one, the one most similar to his Spirit. The other selves do not matter, only that one matters, the self of the Spirit. There are many selves in every man, but only one corresponds to the Spirit. The rest are selves of the soul. These latter ones encourage man to “love God” “love his neighbour”, “turn the other cheek”, “share everything with others”, “cooperate in the work of God”, etc. On the contrary, the self of the Spirit is the greatest opponent of the creator and his creation. It is essential to distinguish between the self that corresponds to the Spirit and the Unknowable God, on one hand, and the other selves, the true legions of the devils, on the other. Saint Thomas said “distinguish to unite” and a Gnostic would say “distinguish to disconnect”. Distinguish in order to better discriminate, to put everything in its place, accept the good and reject evil. Accept that which wakes us up and liberates us, and reject that which enchains and imprisons us. Distinguish to disconnect and separate the two irreconcilable sides engaged in a struggle within man. Distinguish and separate to end the confusion, to put everything where it belongs. The Spirit in man represents the Unknowable God. The body and soul of man represent the creator god. This is what we must distinguish between: the good and the evil within man. We have already said that man has two paths ahead of him and must choose one of them: the path of the Spirit or the path of the soul, enlarge the self or renounce it, be a reflection of the Unknowable God or of the demiurge. 113"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Whoever chooses the path of the soul will be dissolved in the demiurge. Whoever chooses the path of the Spirit will have to face the demiurge and fight him face to face, the only way to liberate the Spirit. In this final battle, the demiurge will be the great solvent force, also called kundalini, the demiurge in man. If the warrior fails there will be no second chance in that manvantara. His self will probably be disintegrated into a thousand pieces. The warrior will die or go crazy. There are many such cases in mental hospitals: warriors beaten by the kundalini force of the demiurge. In the best cases, he will be converted into a permanent worshipper of the creator, or a “master” of the white lodge. On the other hand, if the self of the Spirit is strong enough, it will be able to defeat the demiurge-kundalini and liberate the Spirit forever. The warrior will lose conscience for a short time and will resurrect later as Spirit. Furthermore, the warrior will be able to seize the kundalini force and use it against the demiurge himself. There have also been cases in which the warrior has been so imbued with Spiritual power that the demiurge-kundalini refuses to fight against him, and the warrior, by various means, makes him appear and fight. In this final battle, so essential and definitive, the warrior could lose everything during that manvantara or win everything for all eternity. Which warrior would not be anxious about getting involved in this battle? If the warrior is successful, if he manages to build a bridge to the Spirit and liberate It from Its prison in matter, attaining True Salvation, two paths appear in front of him again. He has defeated the demiurge, he has caused an upheaval in the whole universe and he again finds himself in possession of the inherent powers of the Spirit, infinitely superior to those of the creator god. But he will once again 114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"have to choose between two possibilities. One of these paths is to return to the kingdom of the Unknowable God from which he came and never return to the hell of the demiurge. In that case, he will go back to what he was before his imprisonment in matter. The other path, which most of the liberated Spirits opt for, is to stay in this world to fight for the liberation of the other captive Spirits. Therefore, the successful warrior either abandons his body and soul forever and returns to the world from which he came, or decides to stay here and carry on the fight for the liberation of the prisoners of the demiurge. If he decides to stay he will have converted himself into a saviour of mankind and the world, an immortal and eternal divya, a new member of the Black Order of the Warriors of the Spirit. When a liberated Spirit chooses to stay in the hell of the demiurge to continue the fight, until the last of the enchained Spirits have been liberated, he will have to use his body and soul as instruments. But his old body and soul, created by the demiurge, are not suitable to contain a Spirit which has broken out of the chains and regained Its powers. They would immediately be disintegrated. First, the Spirit will have to transform his body and soul. Originally impure, made from mortal demiurgic matter, the body and soul will be transmuted into divine and eternal matter by the Spirit: the indestructible vajra . The mud and breath of the demiurge will thus become pure and glorious. They will form only one entity with the Spirit, inseparable and indissoluble for the whole of eternity . The Spirit will in this way be covered with vajra, the divine matter, which will allow It to act and to travel through space and time in the plane of the demiurge, and at the 115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"same time produce synchronistic phenomena almost constantly. Vajra, resulting from the transformation of impure matter by a liberated Spirit, is as red as blood and harder than a diamond. The vajra is indestructible and eternal; it cannot be destroyed by the demiurge when a manvatara ends. The triumphant Spirit has seized from the demiurge part of his creation, a body and a soul, and has transformed them into divine matter over which the demiurge has no control. The created has been transmuted into the uncreated by the power of the Spirit! The demiurge created the body and soul of man to be used as a prison cell for the Spirit and the liberated Spirit now ends up using them as tools to oppose the demiurge’s work and plans! The time for the Spirit’s revenge has arrived . We have said that the Spirit has become only one divine entity with his body and soul. Now it will always be a Spirit-Soul-Body, for all eternity. This entity will have the same physical features as did the warrior at the time of his transformation. Young, old, blonde, dark, the same physical features that he had at the time of his transmutation into divine matter of indestructible vajra. In this process of liberation and triumph of the Spirit, it is said that the body and soul have died and been subsequently resurrected. The Spirit has saved them and has integrated them into Itself. The Spirit, now covered by the body-soul of vajra, has also become different to the other Spirits. It will never again be the same as It was before Its imprisonment by the demiurge: a free Spirit of the unknowable plane. It has decided to stay in the demiurgic hell and be invested with indestructible vajra for all eternity. From now on, Vajra will always be the 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"117 distinguishing mark and characteristic feature of the Spirit, the perfect proof of Its triumph over the satanic demiurge and the distinctive sign of Its transformation into Saviour of Mankind and the World. The body and soul, deified and incorporated by the Spirit, will be the trophy which the Spirit will flaunt eternally as a souvenir of Its triumphant passage through the perverse world of created matter . There is an ancient Gnostic text in which Genesis is narrated from the point of view of the Serpent Lucifer, which disappeared one thousand six hundred years ago and was miraculously recovered in the twentieth century in Nag Hammadi, Egypt. In this text, called “The Testimony of Truth”, there is mention of the influence of the liberated Spirit on the kingdom of the demiurge. In some of the Nag Hammadi texts we are told about the resurrection of the body after death. Only a liberated and victorious Spirit can provide true resurrection and salvation. In the Christian myth there are clear references to the work of the Spirit, proof of the Gnostic origin of this religion. When we are told that they went to look for the body of Christ in the tomb and did not find it, they are clearly saying that his body was of vajra and that it had left with the Spirit. In other words, it was about a true Saviour of Man and of the World. This is the best proof. If we want to know if a guide for mankind is an authentic Messenger or Saviour, the best thing we can do is go and look for the body in the tomb. If we cannot find it, it is because the body was of vajra, and has left with the Spirit in perfect union. Furthermore, it has never been stated in christianity that Christ was “merged with God” or “united with God”. On the contrary, it was always maintained that “Christ is with his body, seated at the right hand of God”. When they say"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"118 “with his body”, we can add “of vajra”. These references are clear: Christ is a separate entity, and the God to which they are referring cannot be the creator god, the demiurge. If the liberated and triumphant Spirit enters the unknowable plane, It will always do so with Its new body of red vajra, from which the Spirit will not be able to separate Itself for the whole of eternity. A man reborn in this way is “born twice”, “without death”, immortal and eternal. Such a man, who has liberated himself from the demiurge and his chain of reincarnations, who has definitively broken away from everything created and impure, will always cause an immense upheaval in the created universe. When a Spirit liberates Itself, all creation is liberated a little. When a Spirit manages to liberate Itself and defeat the demiurge in a face to face confrontation, the latter loses power and the ties that imprison the other Spirits become weaker as well. When a Spirit has decided to stay in the hell of the demiurge, It will fight tirelessly until all the Spirits have been liberated and will continue to fight until the demiurge, weakened, ends his perverse breaths of manvantaras and pralayas, until he can no longer create anything and ends up disappearing. In this way, all duality will have disappeared and the world will go back to being only one: the Eternal Kingdom of the True and Unknowable God."}]
