And during that afternoon walk Albert Meier happened to glance upwards and spied a small opening in the ground that took his interest. Finding himself curious Albert Meie r took a torch-light from his back- pack and examined the opening, findi ng that it continued inwards. And so, Albert and his friend Isa Ras hid dug out enough of the surrounding earth to enable them to gain en trance to some sort of chamber. What they both found after crawling insi de was an old tomb in a state of disrepair and half-filled with earth. A nd then after clearing more of the soil away Albert Meier and Isa Rashid discovered a package beneath a flat rock, which they took back to Isa Rashid’s home to examine. The package was said to be about 60 cm long and 25 cm wide, and was found to hold four separate rolls of Aram aic writings which took the name of ‘ The Talmud Of Jm anuel ’. T T h h e e T T a a l l m m u u d d O O f f J J m m m m m a a n n u u e e l l Luckily Isa Rashid had some Palestin ian background in his family, and so could read the old Aramaic text. A nd the first thing that Isa Rashid noticed was that the title page showed that Judas Iscariot had authored this collection of Spiritual Knowledges on behalf of his Teacher and Guid e who was named Jm anuel [pronounced ‘Immanuel’]. Isa Rashid also noted extra-terrestrial links within ‘ The Talmud ’, as it was made clear that that real father of the Biblical Adam was named Semjasa , who was a ‘distant traveller’ from the fa r reaches of Mankind’s Universe, and an aid to ‘ El ’ [or ‘ Go d ’].

Not only were extra-terrestrial links presented in ‘ The Talmud ’, but it was also made clear that Judas Iscariot was actually the friend, student and T T h h e e T T a a l l m m u u d d"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 official scribe/ recorder of the Master Jm anuel 1 M M a a s s t t e e r r J J m m m m m a a n n u u e e l l . The Scrolls also stated that Judas Iscariot never did spite his friend and teacher Jm anuel in the run-up to the Biblical crucifix ion event, as the real culprit of that particular venomous act was a man named T T h h e e S S c c r r o o l l l l s s J J m m m m m a a n n u u e e l l Juda Ihariot, who was the son of Simeon, the Pharisee. The Translation Because of the nature of the revelati ons made clear in the teachings of ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d ’, Isa Rashid offered to transl ate the document in secret, in the hope that the finished version could be made available to the world. And this is a point I will ask you all to bear in mind as this introductory text continues. Also interestingly, and prophetically, Albert Meier had already been told seven years before co-discovering ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d O O O f f f J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’ that he was destined to become the man that would make it available to the world . Which, again, is a point I w ill return to as this introduction unfolds. Anyway, Isa Rashid spent a few mont hs checking the highlights of ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d ’ and imparting them to his friend Albert Meier. And then Isa Rashid began a formal translation in August 1963 into German [Albert Meier’s native language], whilst Albe rt Meier continued onwards to Mehrauli India to train under a Hi ndu Guru and to further his own spiritual knowledges. And after a year in India Al bert Meier continued onwards 2 and journeyed to Turkey, where he met a Greek lady named Kalliope Zafiriou in 1965. And who became his travelling compani on in Asia, and la ter his wife and the mother of Albert’s three child ren when they came to the town of Hinwil in Switzerland to make a home together. Meanwhile Isa Rashid worked on the German translation of ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d O O O f f f J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l   ’, which he completed up to the 36 th Chapter, and which he posted in 1970 in two sepera te packages to an address in Switzerland that had been the home of Albert Meier’s parents. Amazingly, although Meier's parents were no longer living at that particular house, in 1974 the postal o ffice at Neuthal, which was very 1 Who the Established Churches later named ‘Jesus’ [John Grau, 2007]. 2 During a twelve year spiritual quest Al bert Meier have travelled to forty-two different countries [John Grau, 2007]."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 close to the town of Hinwil where Al bert Meier was living with Kalliope, forwarded the two packets onto hi m. And in the same ‘round-about’ manner Albert Meier received a pe rsonal letter from Isa Rashid that spoke about his translation project becoming ‘known to certain authorities 3 ’, which resulted in him fleei ng from Jerusalem to a refugee camp in Lebanon along with his family . However, Isa Rashid’s presence also became known to the Israeli au thorities, and the refugee camp was bombed during an Israeli air-raid 4 , forcing Isa Rashid to flee again to Baghdad without T T T h h h e e e S S S c c c r r r o o o l l l l l l s s s , where he had posted his final letter to Albert Meier. And sadly in 1976 Albert Meier learned that Isa Rashid and his entire family were assassinated in Baghdad shortly after posting that last letter. Of course a true prophecy can never be halted. And so about the time he learnt of Isa Rashid’s assassination Albert Meier began preparing Isa Rashid’s translation of ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d ’ for publication, beginning with a self-published version in German wh ich was fronted in 1978. Two more editions followed with improved Eng lish-German translations, and a 4 th edition was designed by the ‘Steelmark’ Publication company in 2006. Who Really Wrote, And Who Really Owns The Talmud? Well, to back-track to the point when ‘The Talmud’ was originally finalised, we will need to examine what some people believe to be more controversial aspects of the M M M a a a s s s t t t e e e r r r J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’ ’ ’ s s s life, which takes our investigation to the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and then onwards into India. And here comes some more of the so-called ‘apocrypha’, in that ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d O O O f f f J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’ makes it very clear that the M M M a a a s s s t t t e e e r r r J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l [‘Jesus’] never did die on The Cross. H H H e e e only ever fell into a trance-like condition, due to the A A A r r r c c c h h h - - - A A A n n n g g g e e e l l l G G G a a a b b b r r r i i i e e e l l l twinning with J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’ ’ ’ s s s   body to induce a death-like trance. And inside the tomb of Joseph of 3 In the letter Isa Rashid sent, he stated th at he had been ‘persecuted by two different groups, both Christians and Jews, which was to be anticipated, because the rolls are not favourable towards either religion’ . The letter was dated headed ‘Baghdad, September 14.9.1974’ [John Grau, 2007]. 4 There wa s a series of raids during June 18-20, in 1974. These were Israeli air raids upon several refugee camps in South-West Lebanon, reported to be in retaliation for a guerrilla incursion into Chamir in Northern Israel on June 13th. It is believed that the June 1 8th raid was designed to eliminate the ‘Scrolls’, and that the raids upon the several other refugee camps on the following two days [June 19-20] were intended to divert attention away from the real reason for the first raid [John Grau, 2007]."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 Arimathea, J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l was healed and revived by a team of Hindu healers before setting of to India to continue H H H i i i s s s T T T e e e a a a c c c h h h i i i n n n g g g s s s . In-fact it is believed my many scholar s that the full story was only ever completed in India in the early second century. Also, there is a great deal of evidence stating that after Jmmanuel ’s genuine death in the Kashmir region in early 2nd century, that the ‘ S S S c c c r r r o o o l l l l l l s s s ’ were carried back to the Palestinian or Anatolian region by Jm anuel J J m m m m m a a n n u u e e l l ’ ’ ’ s s s oldest son Joseph. And Joseph evidently released a second copy of T T T h h h e e e T T T e e e a a a c c c h h h i i i n n n g g g s s s somewhere in that region, since that copy found its way into the hands of the apostle Matthew 5 . However, Joseph also preserved and hid the original R R R o o o l l l l l l s s s within the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, just south of the Old City of Jerusalem. And there they lay until Albert Meier and Isa Rashid re- discovered them in 1963. Let’s also be aware that it is made clear in ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d ’ that ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T e e e a a a c c c h h h i i i n n n g g g s s s ’ were originally written down by Judas Iscariot who travelled with Jmmanuel to India after the crucifixion, along with Judas-Thomas [ Jmmanuel ’s brother] and Mother Mary. And here we arrive at the interesting part of any deba te over the ownership of ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d O O O f f f J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’. Meaning does J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l own these T T T e e e a a a c c c h h h i i i n n n g g g s s s , or Judas, or Joseph, or the apostle Mathew, or Isa Rashid, or Albert Meier, or the ‘Steelmark’ Publication Company? Do the C C C e e e l l l e e e s s s t t t i i i a a a l l l S S S o o o n n n s s s own ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d ’, who taught J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l when he was taken into the skies for forty days and forty nights?

Yes, what an interesting de bate, and time for a reminder. If you recall there were two points I as ked you all to bear in mind earlier in this introduction. The first thing I asked you all to re-member was that Isa Rashid offered to translate ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d   ’, in the hope that the finished version could be made available to the world . And the second 5 Interestingly, critical biblical scholars like Herman N. Ridderbos do not consider the apostle Matthew to be the original author of this Gospel. In-fact, it is believed that either Judas Iscariot or J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’ ’ ’ s s s son Joseph rendered a second copy of ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d ’ which was at some time found it’s wa y into the hands of the apostle Mathew, and which later took on the title ‘ T T T h h h e e e B B B o o o o o o k k k O O O f f f M M M a a a t t t h h h e e e w w w ’ [John Grau, 2007]."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 point I asked you all to remember was that Albert Meier had been told seven years before co-discovering ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d O O O f f f J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’ that he was also ‘destined’ to make it available to the world . Now the thing I am pondering over, at th is point, is how we can usefully define this ‘whole world’ that ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d O O O f f f J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’ is supposed to be able to reach. Should we be defining this ‘whole world’ as only those people in the ‘whole world’ that have enough money to be able to buy themselves a copy from a book-store? Or do we reall y mean everybody in the ‘whole world’ that would like to read it, regardless of whether they have any money or not ? You see, in my mind the ‘whole world’ means the ‘whole world’: period. And to support this view-point of mine, we can find within J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’ ’ ’ s s s T T T e e e a a a c c c h h h i i i n n n g g g s s s a quote that says: “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for truth and knowledge, for they shall be satisfied 6 ”. And another quote that says: “Blessed are those who know about C C C r r r e e e a a a t t t i i i o o o n n n L , for they are not enslaved by false teachings 7 ”. And it appears to me that we really need to be applying these ‘Pearls of Wisdom’ to our very lives, since, if we do not, we are all in serious danger of merely paying ‘lip-service’ to the L L e e e s s s s s s o o o n n n s s s imparted by the M M M a a a s s s t t t e e e r r r O O O f f f M M M a a a s s s t t t e e e r r r s s s H H H i i i m m m s s s e e e l l l f f f . So, let us investigate further. In Chapter Ten of ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d O O O f f f J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’ we come to a quote that says: “You shall not amass gold, silver or copper in your belts 8 ”. In-fact when the disciple Judas Iscariot secretly collected monies from the audiences listening to J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’ ’ ’ s s s T T T e e e a a a c c c h h h i i i n n n g g g s s s , he was taken aside for a full three days and nights by J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l until Judas saw the error of his ways. And when Judas did see the error of his ways, he became so trust- worthy and non-material that J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l made him the trustee and treasurer of the party of disciples. And if you are wondering why I am discussing any a pparent ownership of ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d O O O f f f J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’, and why I have included the above quotations to aid my discussion, then I will have to tell you the reason. You see, on March 14, 2007, I received an e-mail from the http://www.fourwinds10.com management team telling me about a letter   6 ‘The Talmud Of Jmmanuel’, The Sermon On The Mount, Chapter 5, VS 6. 7 ‘The Talmud Of Jmmanuel’, The Sermon On The Mount, Chapter 5, VS 9. 8 ‘The Talmud Of Jmmanuel’, Commissioning Of The Disciples, Chapter 10, VS 9."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 they had been sent by the ‘Steelmark’ Publication Company 9 who requested that ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d ’ be removed from the server. And the reason given was that ‘Steelmark’ claim to hold ‘exclusive publishing rights to this document’. And yet, we have already seen that when Judas collected monies from the audience listening to J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’ ’ ’ s s s T T T e e e a a a c c c h h h i i i n n n g g g s s s , that Judas was taken aside by the M M M a a a s s s t t t e e e r r r O O O f f f M M M a a a s s s t t t e e e r r r s s s and taught that materialism was clearly not the way. The Spirit Of N.E.S.A.R.A. Many of you that follow the writings on the Spiritual web-sites will know all about the N.E.S.A.R.A. movement 10 . And yet most people believe N.E.S.A.R.A. to be some external thing that is managed by the world’s governments, and that it will neve r officially begin until a T.V. announcement is made saying that this is so. And here I find a point of interest, in that we have all been schooled to believe that we can neve r take charge of the fiscal workings of the Physical Plane until some ‘official representative’ belonging to a Major World Government tells us all that we can do so. Let’s change that now. Now I am not saying that the supposed ownership claim of ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d O O O f f f J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’ is in any way officially connected to the N.E.S.A.R.A. movement. And so, I do not want anybody to get in an uproar about my usage of this simile . But I am saying that there is an issue that has surfaced regarding the FREEWARE STATUS of ‘ T T T h h h e e e T T T a a a l l l m m m u u u d d d ’, that is at least affiliated to the s p irit of the N.E.S.A.R.A. movement; in that here we are being given a chance to step outside the confines of money, and all of it’s trappings , and to give away an important publication that in my   9 Appointed by Eduard Albert Meier to print and sell ‘ The Talmud Of Jmmanuel ’ [John Grau, 2007].

Joseph was the husband of Mary, th e mother of Jmmanuel, who was impregnated by a distant descendant of the celestial son, Rasiel, who was the guardian angel of the secret. 82 . When Joseph heard of Mary's secr et impregnation by a descendant of the celestial sons from the lineage of Rasiel, behold, he was filled with wrath and thought of leaving Mary be fore he would be married to her before the people. 83. While Joseph was thinking in this manner, behold, a guardian angel, sent by Gabriel, the celestial son w ho had impregnated Mary, appeared and said: 84. “Joseph, Mary is betr othed to you, and you are to become her spouse; do not leave her, because the fruit of her womb is chosen for a great purpose. Marry her in all openness, so that you may be husband and wife before the people. 85. \"Behold, the impregnation of Mary occurred eleven thousand years after the procreation of Adam through the celestial son Semjasa, to fulfil the word of god, the ruler of t hose who travelled from afar, who conveyed these words through the prophet Isaiah: 86. \"'Behold, a virgin will be impregna ted by a celestial son before she is married to a man before the people. 87. \"'They will name the fruit of her womb Jmmanuel, which translated means 'the one with godly knowledge,' as a symbol and honour to god.

When Joseph heard this, however, he was mindful of his devoutness to god’s laws, so he brought Mary home and married her before the people. 97. At this time a decree went out fro m Emperor Augustus, that all the world should be counted. 98. This census was the first of its kind and occurred at the time that Cyrenius was governor in Syria. 99. All went to be assessed, each to his own town. 100. Joseph of Galilee, of the town of Nazareth, also went with his wife Mary into the Judaic land to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, 101. in order to be assessed with his wife, Mary, who was pregnant by the celestial son Gabriel from the lineage of Rasiel. 102. When they were there, the time came for her to give birth."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 103. Since they could find no shelter, they spent the night in a stable. 104. And Mary bore her first son on the straw, wrapped him in cloth, and laid him in a manger near the animal s, because there was no other room for her in the inn. Chapter 2 The Wise Men From The Orient 1. When Jmmanuel was born in the stable at Bethlehem, in the shelter in the land of the Jews during the time of Herod Antipas, Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea, behold, wise men arrive d in Jerusalem from the Orient and asked: 2. \"Where is the newborn king of wisdom of the Jews? 3. \"We have seen a bright light in the sky and heard a voice saying, 4. \"Follow the tail of the light, because the king of wisdom of the Jews is born, who will bring great knowledge. 5. \"Therefore we have come to wo rship the newborn king of wisdom. 6. \"He shall possess the knowledge of god and be a son of the celestial son Gabriel. 7. \"His knowledge will be boundless, as will be his power to control human consciousness, so that humans may learn and serve Creation.\" 8. When Herod Antipas heard of this , he was frightened, and with him everyone in Jerusalem, because they feared that the newborn child would wield dreadful power. 9 . Herod Antipas called together all the chief priests and scribes from among the people and inquired of them where Jmmanuel had been born. 10. And they replied: \"In Bethlehem, in the Jewish land; for thus it was written by the prophet Micah: 11. \"'And you, Bethlehem, in the land of the Jews, are by no means the least among the cities in Judea, for from you shall come forth the king of"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 wisdom, who will bring great knowledge to the people of Israel so that they may learn and serve Creation.\"' 12. Thereupon, Herod Antipas called the wise men secretly and diligently asked them when the bright light w ith the long tail had appeared in the sky. 13. He later directed them to Bethlehem, and said, \"Go and search diligently for the young child and wh en you find him, let me know, so that I may also come and adore him. 14. After they had listened to Herod Antipas, they departed. And behold, the light with the long tail, which th ey had observed in the Orient, moved ahead of them with a high singing sound until it reached Bethlehem and stood directly over the stable where the infant was born. 15. When they saw this they were filled with great joy. 16. They then went into the stable and found the young child with his mother, Mary, and with Joseph. And they fell down and worshiped the infant and offered their treasures, which were gold, frankincense and myrrh. 17. However, the voice again rang out from the light high above, saying that they should not return to Her od Antipas because he planned evil for the young child. 18. And they returned to their homeland by another route. 19. After the three wise men had left , behold, the celestial son Gabriel appeared to Joseph, saying: 20. \"Arise and take the in fant and his mother Mary with you and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I beckon you, because Herod Antipas is planning to seek out the young child and kill him, since he fears that this babe might wield terrible power. 21 . \"While you are in Egypt, I will send my messenger to Herod Antipas to teach him the truth.\" 22. And Joseph arose and took the young child and his mother by night and escaped under the guidance of the celestial son Gabriel in the descending light, which fled with them to Egypt."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 23. Here they remained until Herod An tipas had a change of mind and his inner fear abated. 24. When Herod Antipas realized that he had nothing to fear from the young boy, who was credited only with great wisdom and knowledge, he felt safe in his realm. Thus, he pr omised the messenger of the celestial son Gabriel he would no longer pur sue Mary, Joseph and Jmmanuel. 25. Now that Herod Antipas and his followers had changed their attitude, behold, the celestial son Gabriel app eared again before Joseph in Egypt, and said, 26. \"Arise and take the young child and his mother Mary and move to the land of Israel; all those who sought th e child's life have had a change of heart.\" 27. And Joseph stood up, took the child and his mother, and returned into the light which once more had app eared. It brought them to Israel. 28. The celestial son Gabriel brought them back to the land of Galilee. 29. There they dwelled in the city calle d Nazareth, so that what had been spoken by the prophets would be fulf illed, \"Jmmanuel shall be called the Nazarene.\" Chapter 3 John the Baptist 1. In due course, John the Baptist came to the edge of the wilderness and preached at the banks of the Jordan. 2. John the Baptist preached of baptis m in accordance with the old laws of god, according to which the way to knowledge was to be prepared. 3. He preached that god's laws shall be followed because he is the sole ruler of this human lineage. 4. He preached that above god, however, stands Creation, the source of the worlds, universes and all living creatures. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 5. And so he taught that the genderl ess Creation is the mystery of all mysteries; death and life, light and darkness, bei ng and non-being. 6. And so he taught once again that God, the lord and ruler of this human lineage and of those who travelled from afar, the celestial sons, holds Creation in high esteem. 7. All Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went forth to John the Baptist, acknowledging the wisdom of the old laws of god, and let themselves be baptized by him in the river Jordan. 8. John wore a garment made from cam el's hair and a leather belt around his loins. His food consisted of locusts and wild honey. 9. While he was baptizing many of the people, many Pharisees and Sadducees came to him who humiliate d him with malicious talk. 10. But John the Baptist spoke, \"You br ood of vipers, who told you that you will escape from future wrath, once your false teachings are revealed? 11. \"See to it that you bear righteous fruit of repentance and learn the truth. 12. \"Turn away from the evil of your false teachings, which you carry out with arrogance and pursuant with your greed for power and fortune. 13. \"Do not think just of saying to each other, 'We have Abraham as father.’ 14. \"I say to you, with his knowledge and his power, god is able to raise up children to Abraham out of these stones, because he has knowledge of the mystery of Creation. 15. \"Already the axe has been laid at th e root of the trees. Therefore, any tree that does not bring forth good fru it will be hewn down and thrown into the fire. 16. \"You brood of vipers, in two times a thousand years you and your followers, who pursue false teachings out of your own arrogance in your greed for power and fortune, shall be vanquished and, on account of your lies, punished.

He will baptize you with the knowledge of the spirit and with the fire of truth. 24. \"He has his winnowing fork in his hand; he will sweep his threshing floor and gather the wheat into his granary, but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire. 25. \"The lie can never withstand the truth, which destroys evil in its fire.\" 26. As John the Baptist thus spoke, behold, Jmmanuel of Galilee then approached John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him. 27. John, however, refused him and s poke, “It is I who need to be baptized by you because you possess gr eater knowledge than I. And you come to me?\" 28. But Jmmanuel answered him, \"let it happen so now, because it is fitting for us to fulfil all justice, since we are both sons of the Earth.\" 29. So John consented and baptized him. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 30. When Jmmanuel had been baptized, he soon came out of the water of the Jordan, and behold, a metallic li ght fell from the sky and rushed over the Jordan. 31. Consequently they all fell on their faces and pressed them into the sand while a voice from the metallic light spoke: 32. \"This is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased. He will be the king of truth, through which terrestrial humans shall rise as wise ones. 33. Behold, after these words Jmmanue l entered into the metallic light, which climbed into the sky, surrounded by fire and smoke, and passed over the lifeless sea, as the singing of the metallic light soon faded away. 34. After that, Jmmanuel was no longer seen for forty days and nights. Chapter 4 Jmmanuel's Arcanum 1. From this day on, Jmmanuel no longer lived among the sons and daughters of these Earth humans. 2. Jmmanuel was lifted up from the Eart h, and no one knew where he had been taken or what had happened to him. 3. But then he was set down by the metallic light between North and West, in a place where the guardian angels had received guidelines by which they were to evaluate the site for the chosen ones. 4. Thus, he lived for forty days and nights between the winds of the North and the West, where he received the arcanum of knowledge. 5. During this instruction period he spen t his days with the wise saints of God and the guardian angels, the celestial sons. 6. They taught him the wisdom of knowledge. 7. They taught him about the dominion of God over terrestrial humans and over his celestial sons. 8. They also explained to him the omnipotence of the Creation of the universes."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 9. They also taught him about the immortality of the spirit through rebirth. 10. There he saw the initial forefathers, the saints of ancient times, who were the celestial sons and the fa thers of the terrestrial humans. 11. From there he went to the North towa rds the ends of the Earth, where the metallic lights and chariots of fire came down from the sky or shot upwards with a singing sound, enveloped in smoke and fire. 12. There, at the ends of the entire Ea rth, he saw a great and marvellous wonder. 13. In that place he saw the celestial portals open, of which there were three different ones. 14. The celestial portals radiated in the most brilliant Zohar an area as large as the lifeless sea on the river Jordan 18 . 15. Actually gleaming therein was the en tire land of Israel, alive and true, humans and animals and ever ything that was there. 16. In this first celestial portal, no secret was concealed, because the Zohar entered into the smallest spaces in the cottages and revealed the last intimate detail. 17. Inside the second celestial portal, there rose mighty mountains, whose peaks reached into the sky a nd disappeared into the clouds. 18. Far below lay deep masses of sno w, at whose edges a different, brown skinned human population built their huts. 19. The third celestial portal revealed a land of gigantic dimensions, mountainous and interspersed with rivers, lakes and seas, where yet another human population dwelled. 20. Not far from these three celestial por tals had been built the palace of god, the ruler of these terrestrial hum ans and of those who had travelled from afar, the celestial sons, the guardian angels.   18 Zohar: Radiant splendour of Creational energy."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 21. In his palace, god ruled over the three human lineages created by him and over his following, the celestial sons. 22. He was immortal, ancient and of giant size like the celestial sons. 23. In the palace of God, there appear ed to Jmmanuel two very tall men, the likes of whom he had never seen on Earth. 24. Their faces shone like the sun, and their eyes looked like burning torches. From their mouths issued fire. Their clothing resembled a covering of foam, and their arms were like golden wings. 25. They inhabited an environment of their own, because the air of this earthly world would have been fatal for them. 26. These two men from the constella tion of the seven stars were venerable teachers, and they were together with tw o smaller men who said that they were from Baawi. 27. They said: \"People have come fro m the heavens to Earth, and other people have been lifted from Earth in to the heavens; the people coming from the heavens remained on Earth fo r a long time, and they created the intelligent human lineages. 28. \"Behold, humans begotten by the celestial sons were different in a unique way from other people on Earth. 29. \"They were not like Earth humans but like the children of the celestial angels, and of a different kind. 30. \"Their bodies were white as snow and red as the rose blossom, their hair at the top of the head white as wool and their eyes beautiful. 31. \"Earth humans will now retain their inherited beauty and propagate it further. 32. \"But in the course of centuries and millennia they will mix with other human populations and the heavens, so as to generate a new humankind and special lineages, as the celestial sons did with the Earth people. 33. \"Jmmanuel, you are an informed insider, begotten from among our ranks by a celestial son.

Thus they spoke, the celestial sons between the North and the West, before bringing Jmmanuel in the metallic light back to Israel, to the land of Galilee. 52. When Jmmanuel heard that John th e Baptist had been imprisoned, he left the town of Nazareth, came to and lived in Capernaum, which lies by the sea in the land of Zebulon and Naphtali. 53. From that time onward Jmmanuel be gan to preach, saying, \"Repent and turn to the truth and knowledge, because they alone bring you life!\" 54. When Jmmanuel went by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Pete r, and Andrew, his brot her, casting their nets into the sea because th ey were fishermen. 55. And he said to them, \"Follo w me; I will teach you knowledge and make you fishers of people. 56. Thereupon, they left their nets and followed him. 57. As he went on, he sa w two other brothers, Jacob, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, in the boat along with their father, Zebedee, mending their nets. 58. And he called them. 59.

At that time Jmmanuel walked through a field of grain on the Sabbath; and his disciples, being hungry, began to pluck ears of grain and to eat. 2.

And he walked on from there and came into their synagogue, where he continued to teach the people. 14.

But Jmmanuel thanked him and did not repay him with any gifts what ever, so Juda Ihariot thought of re venge, for he was greedy for gold, silver and goods. 6.

The Leaven 55. He told the people another parabl e, \"The spiritual kingdom is like leaven, which a woman took and mixed into three bushels of flour until it was thoroughly leavened.\" 56. Jmmanuel told the people all of this in parables, and he did not speak to them without using parables, 57.

In Nazareth 66. It happened that after Jmmanuel had finished these parables, he went away from there. 67. Arriving in his hometown of Nazareth, he taught in the synagogue.

This will prove true for all time, as long as humanity has little knowledge a nd is enslaved by the delusionary teachings of the scribes and distorters of scripture. 75. \"So it will come true in two tim es a thousand years, when humans have become knowledgeable and thinking, and when my actual unfalsified teachings will be revealed anew. 76. \" The new prophet of that distant future will not possess as much strength and power over evil and sickness. 77. \" But his knowledge will surpass mine , and his revelations about my real teachings will shake the fo undations of the entire Earth , for in his time the world will be inundated by my teachings, as falsified by the distorters of the scriptures, and it will be living in false religious cults that bring death. 78. \"It will be a time when wars from space begin to threaten, and many new gods will seek to rule over the Earth. 79. \"Truly, truly, I say to you, the new prophet will be persecuted not only by a wrong-minded people, as w ill happen to me, but also by the whole world and by many deluded religious cults, which will bring forth many false prophets. 80. \" Yet, before the end of two times a thousand years the new prophet will reveal my unfalsified te achings to small groups , just as I teach the wisdom, the knowledge and the laws of the spirit and of Creation to small groups of trusted friends and disciples.

And he did not there show great signs of his power, nor did he impart his great wisdom because of their disdain for the truth. Chapter 16 Herod And The Baptist 1. At the time when Jmmanuel was stay ing in Nazareth, news about him reached Herod. 2. And he spoke to his people, \"Surel y this is John the Baptist, who has arisen from the dead and who theref ore possesses such mighty powers. 3. For Herod had seized John, bound hi m and put him into prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philippus, and had him beheaded. 4. However it had come to pass previ ously that John reprimanded Herod, saying, \"It is not good that you have taken Herodias, because you have committed adultery with your brother' s wife and therefore you must be punished according to the law.” 5. For this he wanted to kill the Baptist but was afraid of the people, because they considered this man to be a prophet. 6. However, as Herod was celebrati ng his birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and Herod was greatly pleased. 7. He therefore promised her, with an unlawful oath, that he would give her whatever she would demand of him. 8. And as she had been induced acco rdingly by her mother, she said, \"Give me the head of John the Baptist on a silver platter.\"   19 It’s the South-Coast UK [John Grau]."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 9. But the daughter of Herodias wept while saying this, not just because she was inspired with love for John the Baptist, but also because she was devoted to his teachings. 10. The king was pleased that Herodi as had persuaded her daughter to demand the head of john the Baptist, because this way he was not guilty in the eyes of the people, inas much as he had taken an oath. 11. But Herodias' daughter did not know that Herod and her mother had agreed, even before the dance, to demand the head of john the Baptist through her. 12. Thus Herod sent someone and had john beheaded in prison. 13. His head was carried in on a silver platter and given to the girl. 14. She kissed the brow of the decapita ted head, wept bitterly and said, 15. \"1 did not know that love tastes so bitter.\" 16. Then she brought the head of the Baptist to her mother. 17. His disciples then came, took the body and buried it. Then they went to Jmmanuel and told him of the event. 18. When Jmmanuel heard this, he was overcome with fear and retreated by boat to a deserted area. However, when the people heard that, they followed him on foot from the towns. 19. Jmmanuel saw the large crowd from th e water, and feeling sorry for them, he went ashore and healed their sick. The Feeding Of The Five Thousand 20. In the evening his disciples cam e to him and said, \"This area is deserted and night is falling over the land. Tell the people to go away so that they can buy food and drink in the villages.” 21. But Jmmanuel said, \"It is not necessa ry that they go away. Give them food and drink.\" 22. They replied, \"We have nothing he re but five leaves of bread and three fish."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 23. And he said, \"Bring them to me.” 24. And telling the people to stay put, he took the five leaves of bread and the three fish, spoke secret words, broke the leaves of bread, cut up the fish and gave them to his disciples; and the disciples gave them to the people. 25. They all ate and were filled, and they saved what was left over, twelve baskets full of pieces. 26. And there were about five thousand who had eaten. Walking On The Sea 27. Soon afterward Jmmanuel directed hi s disciples to enter the boat and to cross over to the city in advance of him while he would dismiss the people. 28. After he had sent the people away , he climbed up a small mountain alone in order to rest and regain his depleted strength. And so he was there alone in the evening. 29. The disciples' boat was at that tim e in the middle of the sea and being imperilled by the waves, for the wind was against them and the storm was over them. 30. However, on the fourth watch dur ing the night, Jmmanuel approached them, walking on the water of the sea. 31. When his disciples saw him walking on the water, they were terrified and said, \"He is a ghost!\" And they screamed in fear. 32. But soon Jmmanuel came closer, spoke to them and said, \"Be comforted, it is I, do not be afraid. 33. \"Master, is it you!\" Peter asked. 34. \"Truly, it is I,” said Jmmanuel. 35. But Peter answered him and said, \"M aster, if it is you, then let me come to you on the water.” 36.

But when strong thunder ripped th rough the howling storm, he was startled and began to sink, scr eaming, \"Jmmanuel, help me!\" 41. Jmmanuel quickly went to him, stretched out his hand and grabbed him, saying, \"Oh you of little know ledge, why are you frightened and why do you become doubtful in your fright? 42. \"The power of your know ledge gives you the ability, as you have just witnessed. 43. \"You trusted in my words before the thunder came, but then you were frightened and began to doubt, and so the power of knowledge left you and your ability disappeared. 44. \"Never doubt the power of your spir it, which is a part of Creation itself and therefore knows no limits of power. 45. \"Behold, there was a little bird that circled at great heights and sang, rejoicing about life, when a strong gust of wind came and made it waver.

They stepped into the boat, a nd Jmmanuel commanded the storm to stop. It abated and the winds ceased. 48. Those who were in the boat marv elled and said, \"You are indeed a master of the spirit and someone who knows the laws of Creation. 49. \"No one like you has ever been bor n among us, nor has any prophet known to us had such power.\""},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 50.

And they went across the sea and came ashore at Gennesaret. 60. And as the people in that region b ecame aware of him, they sent word throughout the land and brought to him all who were sick. 61. Then they asked him if they might just touch the hem of his garment, so they would be healed. 62. And thus it came to pass; those w ho touched the hem of his garment became well.   20 Petale: Highest level of spiritual deve lopment that a pure-spirit form can attain before it ultimately melds with Creation and becomes one with it."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71 Chapter 17 Human Commandments And The Laws Of Creation 1. Pharisees and scribes from Jeru salem came to Jmmanuel and said, 2. \"Why do your disciples disregard the statutes of the elders?\" 3.

But he answered and spoke, \"All pl ants that do not live according to the laws of Creation, will dry up and rot. 16. \"Leave them be, they are blind leaders of the blind; but when a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into the pit. 17. \"But let us go away, so that the henchmen remain without booty. 18. Then Peter answered him saying, \"Please interpret your speech about the plants and the blind men for us.\" 19. But Jmmanuel reprimanded his discip les and said, \"Are you, too, still without wisdom and therefore also ignorant and doubting in recognition, comprehension and understanding? 20. \"You have been with me for a long time now, but you still lack the ability to think and recognize the truth. 21. \"Truly, I say to you, you yourselves will do much toward falsifying my teachings in the future. 22. \"In your knowledge you barely exceed the other people. 23. \"Haven't you realized yet that a ll the parables and speeches have a spiritual meaning and are therefore about the spiritual life of humans? 24. \"Oh, you of little knowledge, does your understanding still not extend beyond the stupidity of the people? 25. \"Beware, lest you see me in a fals e light and accuse me of an origin from which I could not have descended.

And he left them and went away. The Leaven And The Pharisees 7. When they sailed across th e sea and arrived at the other shore, they had forgotten to take along some bread. 8. But Jmmanuel said to them, \"Take care and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees:' 9. They spoke to each other and said, \"This must refer to our not having brought along bread or anything else to eat.\" 10. When Jmmanuel heard this he wa s angry and said, \"Oh you of little knowledge, why does it worry you that you have no bread? 11. \"Don't you yet understand, and can't you imagine the meaning of my words? 12. \"Are you then of such little knowledge and without understanding that you can't recognize the meaning? 13. \"Do you still not understand, and do you intend not to understand for all times? 14. \"Don't you remember the five leav es of bread and the three fish divided among the five thousand a nd how many basketfuls you then saved?

Jmmanuel came into the area of Caesarea Philippi and asked his disciples, \"Who do the people say that I am?\" 18. They said, \"Some say that you ar e John the Baptist, others that you are Elijah and still others that you are Jeremiah or one of the old prophets: 19. And he said to them, \"But who do you say that I am?\" 20. Simon Peter answered, saying, \"Y ou are the prophesied Messiah and a son of the living god who is the sp iritual ruler of the three human lineages.\" 21. Jmmanuel became angry and answ ered, saying to him, \"Oh you unfortunate one, my teachings have not revealed this to you, for I instructed you in the truth. 22. \"And I also tell you, you certainly are a faithful disciple, but your understanding must be compared to that of a child. 23. \"You are Peter, and I cannot build my teachings on your rock.

From that time onward, Jmmanuel bega n to tell his disciples that he would have to go to Jerusalem and suffer much from the elders, scribes and chief priests, because he could not help but bring his teachings to them. 29.

Chapter 22 Entry Into Jerusalem 1. As they approached Jerusalem at Bethphage near the Mount of Olives, Jmmanuel sent forth two of his disciples and said to them, 2. \"Go into the village that lies ahead, and forthwith you will find a female donkey tied to a post and a foal with her; untie her and bring her"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86 to me, because she is a present to me and is only tempor arily being kept there at the stable. 3. \"And if anyone questions you, say, 'Jmmanuel of Nazareth needs her.” and right away he will let you have her. 4.

When the people heard that J mmanuel, the king of wisdom, was coming, they spread their clothes on the path. Others cut branches from the trees and scattered them on the path. 7. And the people who walked ahead of him and those who followed him shouted and said, \"Hail to the descenda nt of David. Praise be to him who comes to proclaim anew the teachings of truth. 8. And when they entered Jerusalem, the whole city became excited and asked, \"Who is it that's coming?\" 9. The people replied, \"It is Jmmanuel, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee, who brings anew the teachings of truth. Purging Of The Temple 10. Jmmanuel went into the temple in Jerusalem and became furious when he saw that traders, vendors, dove merchants a nd moneychangers had established themselves there. 11. Jmmanuel was very upset and said to them, \"It is written: 'The temple is to be a place of teaching and a pl ace of contemplation.' But you make it into a den of thieves.\" 12.

And he left them there and departed from the city for Bethany, where he stayed overnight. Back In Jerusalem 17. And when Jmmanuel returned agai n to the temple and taught, the chief priests, scribes, and the elders of the people came to him and asked, \"By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you the authority?\" 18. But Jmmanuel answered, saying to them, \"l, too, want to ask you a question, and if you answer it, I will tell you by whose authority I am doing everything. 19. \"Whence came the baptism of john? From Creation or from men?\" 20.

They replied to him, \"He proba bly had the villains punished and banished and turned his vineyard over to other vine-dressers who paid his lease at the proper time and, surely, he turned over the inheritance to the administrator's son in advance.\" 42. Jmmanuel spoke to them, \"You have recognized the meaning, and you have also read it in the scriptures : 'The stone that the builders threw away became the cornerstone.' 43. \"Therefore I tell you, I am like the son of the administrator of the vineyard, and you are like the vine-dressers that leased the vineyard. 44. \"My teachings truly are not foreign to you and you are well acquainted with them, for they have already been given, handed down, and made known to you by the prophets. 45. \"But if you disregard, falsify and interpret them to your advantage, you are also calling me a liar; th ereby you also call god a liar, upon whose resolve I was begotten by one of his kind and stand before you as a prophet. 46. \"Therefore I say to you, peace a nd joy shall be taken from you and your people for all eternity, and all sh all be given to a people who bring forth their fruits. 47. \"If you disregard and trample on all the commandments of god, who is the ruler over this and the two ot her human lineages in the North and the East, you shall be disregarded and trampled upon for all time. 48. \"The burden of the Israelite people will be like a heavy stone of the seven Great Ages.

When the Pharisees held counsel on how they could snare Jmmanuel in his speech, they sent their followers to him, including some of Herod's people. 2. They then said, \"Master, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of the laws rightly, and don't inquire about anyone, since you do not care about people's reputations, but onl y about the laws of God and, in fact, the laws of Creation. 3. \"Therefore, tell us your opinion. Is it right to pay tax to the emperor or not?\" 4. But Jmmanuel sensed their malice and said, \"You deceivers, hypocrites and swindlers, how low in inte lligence and understanding are you that you want to tempt me in such a sick and foolish manner? 5. \"Show me a tax coin so that I can heal you from your sick folly\" And so they gave him a denarius. 6. And he said to them, \"Whose imag e and whose inscription are on this coin?\" 7. They replied,\"-They are the emperor's.” 8. He then said to them, \"Give ther efore to the empe ror what is the emperor's, and give to god what is god's, and give to Creation what is Creation's. 9. \"Yet beware and know that god and the emperor are men above whom is the omnipotence of Creation to which you must give the highest praise, 10. \"For although god is indeed ruler over humankind and the emperor is indeed ruler over peoples, above them stands Creation as the highest"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 authority, to which they are subordinate in the law, as is every human being and all life.\" 11.

They asked him, \"Master, Moses has said, 'When a man dies and has no children his brother shall take the widow as his wife and begot descendants for his brother.' 14. \"Once there were seven brothers among us. The first one was married and died, and because he had no descendants he left his wife to his brother; 15. \"And so did the second and the third, until the seventh. 16. \"At last the woman also died. 17. \"Now you teach there is a renewed life. Whose wife will she be among the seven in the new life, for she was the wife to all of them.\" 18. Jmmanuel, however, answered, sayi ng, \"You are mistaken and do not know the unadulterated scriptures of the elders, nor do you know the laws of Creation. 19. \"Truly, I say to you, Moses neve r gave this commandment; but he gave the commandment that a brother should take his brother's wife to himself in honour, so if one died the other would take care of the widow of his brother. 20. \"How is it possible for a brother to begot descendants for his brother, since everyone's seed is different? 21. \"In the next incarnation they all w ill be strangers because they will not recognize each other; therefore, no law says the wife then belongs to this one or that one.

When the people heard that, they were aghast and afraid. The Greatest Commandment 31. But when the Pharis ees heard that Jmmanuel had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered and deliberated. 32. And one among them, a scribe, te sted him by asking, Jmmanuel, which is the foremost commandment in the law?\" 33. Jmmanuel asked in return, \"Whose law are you thinking of, the law of the emperor, or are you thinking of th e law of god, or are you thinking of the law of Creation?\" 34.

Thereupon Jmmanuel said to the henchmen, 'You came here with swords and poles to capture me as though I were a murderer. 34. \"How easy it would have been for you to capture me in the city as I sat there in the temple, teaching daily, yet you did not seize me. 35. \"You hypocrites, you were no doubt afra id of the people; therefore you now come to me like thieves so you can throw me into prison in darkness, out of the sight of the people. 36. \"Truly, I say to you, darkness w ill become light, and everyone will speak of your deed for which you will be denounced for all time to come.\" 37. But then Simeon, the Pharisee, raised his voice and said, \"How foolish your talk is and so full of lies. Why should we fear the people? 38. \"You have taught the people falsel y, despised our laws and called them lies; so for this you must now suffer. 39. \"You thought we would not capture you and bring you to trial, but you were mistaken. 40. \"One of those who was with you was not of your mind and has betrayed you for thirty pieces of silver--namely, Judas Iscariot.” 41. Jmmanuel answered, saying, \"Truly, I say to you, for a long time you may succeed in accusing Judas Iscariot as my betrayer before the people, but the truth will come out and be known by all people throughout the entire world; "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 118 42. \"namely, that my betrayer is not Judas Iscariot but is your son, Juda Ihariot, who bears the name of his father, the Pharisee.\" 43. Simeon Ihariot, the Pharisee, wa s furious, stepped up and struck Jmmanuel in the face with his fist b ecause he was afraid of his true words. 44. After this happened, the disciple s, fearful and discouraged, turned away from Jmmanuel and fled. 45. Those who had seized Jmmanuel led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes, Pharisees, and elders of the people had gathered to pass judgment on him. Jmmanuel Before The High Council 46. The chief priests, however, a nd the high councillors sought false testimony against Jmmanuel so they might put him to death. 47. And even though many false and bribed witnesses appeared, they were unable to find any false testimony. 48. Finally, two stepped forward and said , \"He has said that God is not Creation, but simply a man like you and me. 49. \"He also said that he was begotte n by a guardian ange l of God, by the name of Gabriel' 50. Caiaphas, the high priest, arose a nd said to Jmmanuel, \"Will you not reply to what these two bear witness against you?\" 51. But Jmmanuel remained silent a nd smiled benignly; therefore the high priest spoke to him, \"l adjure you by the living God to tell us if you were begotten by the angel Gabriel, who is an angel of God, as the scriptures attest!\" 52. And Jmmanuel replied, \"A s you say, but I also say to you that god is not Creation; instead he is lord ove r the three human lineages that were begotten on Earth through his will; "},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 119 53. \"God has come from the vastness of the universe and has brought the world under his will; therefore he is the supreme emperor of these three human populations. 54. \"One of them is here in this c ountry, which you have deprived of its rights and subjugated; another is in the east as far as the land of India, and the third is in the north from the la nd of the king with horns to the sea where icy mountains drift in the water. 55. \"There are seven human lineages living in all the directions of the wind, from one end of the Earth to the other; 56. \"God is lord over them also, alt hough they serve other gods who also are not of this Earth. 57. \"If you consider god to be Creati on, you are mistaken and commit a sacrilege against the truth. 58. \"Just as you are human like I am, so god is human, except that in spirit and consciousness he is very mu ch more advanced than the human lineages procreated by him; 59. \"God and his celestial sons are ot her human lineages who have come from the stars out of the depths of space in their machines of metal. 60. \"Creation stands immeasurably hi gher than god and his celestial sons, who are the guardian angels. 61. \"Creation alone is the incalculable my stery that begets life and, thus, stands immeasurably far above god and indeed all life. 62. \"Recognize the truth of this teaching, so that you may attain knowledge and wisdom in truth:' 63. Thereupon Caiaphas, the high priest, rent his clothes and spoke with rage, \"He has blasphemed God, the Cr eator. Why should we need further testimony against him? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy for yourselves. 64. \"What punishment do you think he deserves?\" 65. They answered, saying, \"He deserves death.\" "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 120 66. Then they beat him with thei r fists and spat in his face. 67. And some of them struck him from behind and said, \"Prophesy, you great king of wisdom and son of a celestial son, who is it that's beating you?\" 68. Peter had followed Jmmanuel a nd the group, and hid among the people looking through the doors and wi ndows. Thus, he saw what was being done to Jmmanuel. 69. Then a maid approached him a nd said, \"Aren't you one of the disciples of this Jmmanuel from Galilee?\" The Denial By Peter 70 . When Peter was asked by the maid, he denied it and said, \"What kind of nonsense do you accuse me of? I don't know what you're talking about!\" 71. But because of the ma id's question, he was afraid and wanted to escape from the place, for he feared for his life. 72. As he walked out the door, behold, another woman saw him and told the people, \"This man was together with the blasphemer from Nazareth!\" 73. But Peter lied a second tim e, and, raising his hand as in an oath, said, \"Truly, I don't know that confused person!\" 74. And when Peter left the house, those who had been standing there came up to him, saying, \"Aren't you one of those who serve this Jmmanuel? You're giving yourself aw ay through your manner of speech.\" 75. Peter began to revile Jmmanuel, cu rsed himself and swore, \"l don't know this crazy person or his blasphemous teachings of God!\" 76. But soon thereafter a rooster crowed three times, and Peter thought of Jmmanuel's words; and he hurriedly ran away from there and wept bitterly. Chapter 29 The Suicide of Juda Ihariot 1. Juda Ihariot, the betrayer of J mmanuel, was among the councillors who wanted to kill Jmmanuel. "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 121 2. But when he saw what appalling injustice and torture Jmmanuel was undergoing, and that his face was bl oody, he felt repentant. Suddenly great distress and misery was within him. 3. At odds with himself, he took his moneybag, tossed it before the chief priests and council elders and said, 4. \"I have done evil to this person because I was thinking only of gold and silver and goods and wealth. 5. \"I repent that I have betrayed innocent blood because his teachings do not seem evil to me.\" 6. But the chief priests and elders replie d, \"Of what concern is that to us? 7. \"Behold, it is up to you what you want to do to live in peace with yourself.\" 8. And Juda Ihariot wept and fled fro m there, and soon he hanged himself from a tree branch in the field of th e potter beyond the walls of the city. 9. The chief priests, however, took the pi eces of silver and said, \"It is use less to put them into the collecti on box, because this is blood money. What shall we do with it?\" 10. Then one of the sons of the elders came forth and said, \"l followed Juda Ihariot and he has hanged himself from a tree branch in the field of the potter\" 11. Thereupon Caiaphas, the high priest, said, \"Well then, give this blood money to the potter and buy his field w ith it for the burial of strangers.” 12. At dawn the following day the bus iness matter was se ttled, and Juda Ihariot, the betrayer of Jmmanuel, was the first to be buried in the field. 13. But the chief priests and elders of the council spread the news among the people that Judas Iscariot, the disciple of Jmma nuel, had hanged himself as Jmmanuel's betrayer and was hurriedly buried in the field of the potter. 14. The people believed this talk, and they said, \"He betrayed his friend for pieces of silver, and it serves him right that he hanged himself. "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 122 15. \"He has taken a blood-guilt upon hi mself and so from now on the field of the potter shall be known as the Field of Blood.\" Before Pilate 16. Jmmanuel, however, was brought be fore Pilate, the governor, who asked him, \"Are you Jmmanuel, whom they call the King of Wisdom?\" 17. He said, \"As you say. This is what the people call me. 18. And Pilate asked and spoke, \"Is it also said that you were begotten by the angel Gabriel, who is an angel of God?\" 19. But he said, \"As you say.” 20. Pilate inquired once again, saying, \"Let us hear your wisdom, for your teachings are new to me. 21. Jmmanuel spoke, \"Behold, aeons ago, I returned from the realm of a higher world in order to fulfil a difficult task; and now I was begotten by a celestial son to be a prophet in this life. This came to pass according to destiny and the desire of god, th e ruler over the three lineages of terrestrial humans procreated by him. 22. \"Through his kindness, I have a dded to my knowledge in this incarnation by gaining great insight and learning true wisdom, which was imparted to me by his teachers over a period of forty days and forty nights. 23. \"Furthermore, I have travelled exte nsively to faraway places and lived for many years in the land of India. There I was taught much knowledge and many secrets by the great wise and knowledgeable men who are known as masters. 24. \"When I have fulfilled my mission here, I will return there with Thomas, my brother, who is a faithful disciple of mine. 25. When they heard Jmmanuel's speech , the elders and chief priests became very agitated and shouted in front of Pilate, \"Do you hear his blasphemy?\" 26. Thereupon Pilate asked him, \"Don' t you hear how harshly they accuse you? Don't you wish to justify yourself?\""},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 27. Jmmanuel answered him, saying, \"Behold, I will carry my burden as it is destined. 28. \"But it is also true that many do oppose me and will testify falsely against me, whence I will not find justice. 29. \"Truly, I say to you, many dogs w ill kill a hare, regardless of how many turns it makes. 30. \"It is also customary among humans that the most righteous person does not find justice, because it doe sn't matter whether many or few testify against him, as long as they are highly regarded. 31. \"Justice rules only in the laws of nature, because they are the laws of Creation. 32. \"But among humans there is little ju stice, and it is decided according to their social status and their wealth. 33. \"Therefore I ask you, how could I e xpect justice by this standard?\" 34. Pilate said, \"Judging from the way you speak, you are very wise and I see no fault in you. 35. \"I question the teaching you just uttered, but in this, too, I see no guilt, for everyone should find salvation according to their faith. 36. \"But since you have nothing to say regarding your innocence that would counter the denunciation of the chief priests and the elders, I see no hope for you, because their will is my command, to which I must be pliant.\" 37. But Jmmanuel did not answer him, which surprised the governor very much. The Conviction of Jmmanuel 38. At the time of the Passover feas t, Governor Pilate customarily released to the people whichever pr isoner they most wanted, except for those guilty of murder or of causing death. 39. At this time he held a special prisoner by the name of Barabbas. "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 124 40. And when the people were gathered , Pilate asked them, \"Which one do you want me to release: Barabbas, the criminal, or Jmmanuel, who is said to be a king of wisdom and the son of an angel?\" 41. But he well knew that the chief priests and elders had bribed the people by giving them copper, gold and silver, so they would plead for the release of Barabbas and the death of Jmmanuel. 42. For he well knew that they had turned him over out of envy and hatred, since his teachings appealed to the people. 43. His wife had also implored Pilate by saying, \"Have nothing to do with this righteous man, for today I suffe red greatly in my dreams because of him, and I find that his teachings are good.\" Therefore, he was favourably inclined toward Jmmanuel. 44. But among the people there was much screaming and he asked once again, \"Which one shall I release to you?\" 45. Slowly the screaming stopped, a nd the governor raised his voice a third time, asking, \"Which one of these two shall I release?\" 46. And the people screamed, \"Release Barabbas!\" 47. And Pilate asked them, \"Thus it shall be, but what shall I do with him who is said to be Jmmanuel, a king of wisdom?\" 48. And the people shouted, \"Crucify him! Have him crucified!\" 49. But the governor was not willing a nd asked very angrily, \"What evil has he done that you want him crucified? 50. \"He only taught a new doctrine, and for this he should suffer death? Where then is the freedom of speech, thought and opinion?\" 51. But the people screamed even loude r, \"Have him crucified! Have him crucified!\" 52. When Pilate realized there was great unrest and turmoil and that he could do nothing against the will of th ese people, who had been bribed, he took a pitcher of wa ter and washed his hands before the people, saying, "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 125 53. \"You decide what should be done with him. 54. \"He is the prisoner of the elders a nd chief priests, so let them judge him: 55. \"I will have nothing to do with this just man. I am innocent of doing anything to him and wash my hands before you in innocence.\" 56. But the people milled about, shouting, \"Crucify him! Crucify him!\" 57. Then Pilate turned Jmmanuel over to the chief priests and elders and released Barabbas to the people. 58. And the chief priests and elders had Jmmanuel wh ipped and handed him over to be crucified. 59. The people screamed and shouted and cursed Jmmanuel. 60. However the chief priests and elde rs indulged themselves in self- praise and were in good spirits because their intrigue had been successful. Chapter 30 Defamation of Jmmanuel 1. The governor's soldiers agreed with the chief priests and the elders and, dragging Jmmanuel with them into the court house, they brought the entire crowd in with him. 2. They undressed him and put a purple mantle on him. 3. They made a wreath of thorns, placed it on his head, put a reed into his right hand and, bending their knees before him, said, 4. \"We greet you, great King of Wisdom of the Jews.\" 5. And they spat on him, took the reed from his hand, and beat him on the head with it until blood ran down his face. 6. When he was wretched and bleeding, Caiaphas, the high priest, asked, \"How are you doing now, great King of Wisdom?\" "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 126 7. But Jmmanuel was quiet and said not one word. Prophetic Declaration 8. Then they hit him again on the head, and he moaned in pain and began to speak, \"Indeed it is the truth that I am the king of wisdom of the Jews, as it is written by the old prophets. Thus , I am also the true prophet of all humankind on Earth. But in all trut h, I am not the prophet of those confused Israelites who call themselv es the sons and daughters of Zion. 9. \"Truly, I say to you, just as you beat and mock me, you shall be beaten and mocked by those whom you, since ancient times, have enslaved and whose land you and your fore fathers have plundered. 10. \"And the time will come in five times a hundred years when you will have to atone for this, when the le gitimate owners of the land, whom you have enslaved and deprived of their rights, will begin to rise up against you and fight against you on into the distant future. 11. \"A new man will arise in this land as a prophet, and he will legally and rightfully condemn and persecute you, and you sha ll pay with your blood. 12. \"This man will establish a new re ligious cult specifically for the forceful preservation of the truthful teachings and will have himself recognized as a prophet. Through thes e actions he will persecute you for all times. 13. \"Although according to your claim he will be a false prophet, just as you slanderously claim of me, he will bring you new teachings that will seem false to you. Nonetheless, he will be a true pr ophet, and he will have great power. He will have your people persecuted for all times. 14. \"His name will be Mohammed, and his name will bring horror, misery and death to your kind, just as you deserve. 15. \"Truly, truly, I say to you, his name will be writte n for you in blood, and because of your offences the hatred against your people will be endless. 16. \"In this way, he will be a true prophet, even though you will claim him to be a false one, and he will br ing you teachings that will in part seem confusing and unintelligible to you. His emerging religious cult will"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 127 eventually end when his and your followers lay the foundation for a bloody conclusion. His teachings, too, w ill be distorted and falsified, and will result in an evil and confused religious cult.\" 17. And as he spoke in this manner, th e chief priests and members of the council of elders seethed with rage and beat him so harshly that he collapsed and whimpered. The Crucifixion 18. Once they had beaten and mocked him, they took off his mantle, put back on him only his undergarments and led him away in order to crucify him. 19. Upon his right shoulder they placed a heavy wooden cross, so that he himself would have to carry this great burden to the place of his own death. 20. But the cross was heavy, and Jmmanuel groaned under the burden. His blood combined with his sweat into a vile mixture. 21. Jmmanuel collapsed under the heavy burden because his strength left him. 22. But when a stranger came along by the name of Simon of Cyrene, they forced him to he lp carry the cross. 23. Soon they arrived at the place called Golgotha. 24. His path there was difficult, because he was being beaten, reviled and mocked. 25. They gave him wine to drink mixed with the bile from animals. 26. When he tasted it, he did not want to drink it, and so they beat him to make him drink it. 27. Then they forced him down on th e cross while beating him, and nailed his hands and feet onto the w ood. This was done for the first time and contrary to custom, because until then the crucified were tied to the cross. "},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 128 28. After they had nailed him upon the cr oss and erected it, they divided his clothing among themselves by casting lots. 29. And they sat around and guarded him, so that no one would come to take him from the cross. 30. Also, two murderers were crucified w ith him, one to his right and one to his left, so he was between them. 31. Those all around him defamed, mocked and ridiculed him. 32. They shouted, \"Since you are the King of Wisdom, help yourself! 33. \"And since you are the son of a cel estial son and possess great power, get down from the cross!\" 34. The scribes, Pharisees, chief priest s and elders of the people likewise mocked him, saying, 35. \"You helped others, but you cannot help yourself. 36. \"Since you are a king of wisdom, get down from the cross and help yourself. 37. \"If you do that, we will believe in you and your teachings. 38. \"He trusted in his wisdom and in his being the son of the angel Gabriel. 39. \"Thus, let his wisdom or the angel Gabriel save him now if he so desires.\" 40. Likewise, the murderers crucified to his right and left mocked and reviled him. 41. Then the sky clouded over, the s un became dark, and a great storm spread across the land, which was rare at that time of year but happened now and then. 42. The terrible storm raged for three hours before the sun again broke through the clouds. "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 129 43. At that time Jmmanuel cried out, \"I'm thirsty! Give me something to drink.\" 44. And right away one of the chief priests ran, took a sponge, soaked it in vinegar and stuck it on a lance for him to drink. 45. But when the others saw that, they scolded the man, saying, \"Stop! Do not give him any more to drink. Let us see how long he can bear this.\" 46. And behold, a final powerful thunderclap broke up the storm, whereupon the entire land trembled, and the ground shook. 47. Amid the tremendous thunder, Jmmanuel again cried out, but nobody understood him, because his speech was confused. 48. Then his head fell forward, he sli pped into a state of near-death, and they presumed he was dead. 49. It came to pass that a soldier took his lance and stabbed Jmmanuel in his loin to ensure that he was dead. 50. Blood mixed with water flowed from the wound as is the case when a person is dead or in a near-death state. 51. Thus the soldier thought Jmmanuel was dead, and he informed the others. 52. They were all astonished, because it was unusual for the crucified to die so quickly. 53. But since the soldier had told them so, they believed him and departed. 54. Among them were also many wome n and others who watched from a distance, because they were followers of Jmmanuel; they had served him and followed him from Galilee. 55. Among them were Jmmanuel's moth er, Mary, and Mary Magdalene, and others. 56. Once the people had departed, they went to him, knelt before the cross and wept bitterly because they, too, thought Jmmanuel was dead. "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 130 57. Also among them, however, was Jose ph of Arimathea, a follower of Jmmanuel. 58. After a short while he noticed that Jmmanuel was not quite dead, but he told no one. Entombment 59. He quickly went into the city, to Pilate, and asked him for the body of Jmmanuel so that he could bury him. 60. Pilate ordered that he should be given to him. 61. And many people went with him and they removed Jmmanuel from the cross. Joseph wrapped the body in pure linen, which he had previously coated so as to form an image of Jmmanuel. 62. Joseph of Arimathea then carried the body of Jmmanuel all the way as far as Jerusalem and placed it outside the city into his own tomb, which he had arranged to be cut into a rock for his future burial. 63. And he rolled a large stone in front of the door of the tomb and went to obtain medicine so he could take care of Jmmanuel. 64. The entrance of the tomb was gua rded by soldiers and Jmmanuel's mother so no one could enter and steal the body. 65. Joseph of Arimathea, however, sought out Jmmanuel's friends from India and returned with them to th e tomb. There they entered through a secret second entrance unknown to the he nchmen and soldiers, and for three days and three nights they nurse d him. Soon he was in better health and again with good strength. 66. The tomb was being guarded on the other side by the soldiers because the chief priests and Pharisees had gone to Pilate and said, 67. \"Sir, we have considered that when this crazy man was still alive, he said to the people, 'l shall return af ter three days and three nights and rise, because I will only be in a state of near-death.' 68. \"But since it was established through a soldier that he was really dead, his tomb should be guarded so that no one can come, steal the body and say, 'Behold, he has risen from the dead after all!'"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 69. \"Command therefore that the tomb be guarded up to the third day so that the last deception may not be worse than the first.\" 70. And Pilate said to them, \"Take my soldiers as guardians. Go and guard the tomb as best you can.\" 71. And they departed, guarded the to mb, and secured the stone in front of the door with a seal. 72. However, they did not realize the secret of the grave, namely, that it had two exits or entrances, Jmmanuel' s helpers, therefore, could go to him to apply healing salves and he rbs without being detected. On the third day he was once again strong enough to walk. Chapter 31 Jmmanuel's Flight From The Tomb 1. When dawn broke on the first day of the week after Passover, the three days and nights had passed followi ng which Jmmanuel would live again after his near-death, as he had foretold. 2. And behold, a great thundering arose in the air, and a radiant light came from the sky and settled on the earth, not far from the tomb. 3. Then a guardian angel stepped fort h from the light; his appearance was like lightning and his garment was as white as snow. 4. And he went to the tomb, and the so ldiers, full of fear, moved out of his way. 5. He lifted his hand, and from it bright lightning sprang forth and struck the soldiers, one after the other. 6. And they fell to the ground and did not stir for a long time. 7. Then the guardian angel stepped up to the tomb, rolled the stone away from the door and said to Mary, the mother of Jmmanuel, and to Mary Magdalene, who were both there: 8. \"Don't be afraid, I know you s eek Jmmanuel, the crucified. "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 132 9. \"He is not here, for he is alive just as he said he would be. Come here and behold the place where he has lain. 10. \"Go quickly and tell his disciples th at he has risen from near-death. 11. \"Also tell them: He will walk be fore you to Galilee, and there you will see him. Behold, I have told you. 12. But Mary asked, \"Yet he was d ead and lay here dead. How can he then rise?\" 13. The guardian angel answered, \"Why are you seeking a live person among the dead? 14. \"Go now and spread the news among his disciples, but beware of telling anyone else. 15. And the guardian angel went to the bright light and disappeared into it. Soon a great thundering came forth from it again, and it rose up into the air, shooting straight into the sky. 16. Jmmanuel's mother and Mary Magda lene then departed, leaving the tomb. 17. The soldiers, however, recovered from their paralysis and were greatly astonished. So they went into the city to spread the news of what had happened. 18. And secretly they met with the chie f priests and elders of the council to decide what to tell the people. 19. The chief priests and elders gave sufficient money to the soldiers and said, \"Tell the people his disciples came at night while we were sleeping and stole his body.\" 20. And the soldiers took the money and did as they had been instructed. 21. Mary and Mary Magdalene, however, left and did as they had been mandated by the guardian angel. 22. And behold, again a guardian ange l met them on their way and said, \"Remember what you have been instru cted to do. Be careful and do not inadvertently tell the people.”"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 133 23. Mary Magdalene approached the gua rdian angel, who wore a brilliant white garment, and she wanted to grasp his hand. 24. But he stepped back from her and said, \"Do not touch me, because I am of a different kind from you and my garment is a protection against this world. 25. \"If you touch me you will die and be consumed by fire. 26. \"Step back from me and be on your way as you have been instructed.\" 27. So they departed, and they met Peter and another disciple, telling them what had taken place. 28. Peter and the other disciple went to the tomb, with the other disciple arriving there first. 29. And he looked into the tomb and sa w the linen bandages lying neatly on the ground, but he did not enter. 30. Then Peter arrived, went into th e tomb and found everything just as the other disciple had. 31. The bandages had been carefully folded and placed on the ground. The sweat cloth, which had covered Jmmanuel's head, had been placed on a particular spot, together with the salv es and herbs and clay figurines of peculiar appearance, the likes of whic h he had never s een before. Thus they were foreign to him. Jmmanuel's Meetings With His Disciples 32. In the evening of the same day, the disciples were gathered in the room in the city where they had ta ken their last meal with Jmmanuel before Passover. 33. And they were in the room speak ing to each other about what had happened that day when, behold, th e door opened and a stranger entered whom they had never seen before. 34. And they were afraid that he might be one of the Israelites who wanted to betray them. "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134 35. But then the stranger said, \"Peace be with you:' and when he took the cloth from his face, they recognized him as Jmmanuel. 36. After he had said that, he showed them his hands, his loin and his feet; and when they saw his w ounds, they were happy he was among them. 37. But Thomas believed a ghost to be in front of him. So he said, \"lf I could touch your wounds, I would know that you are not a ghost.\" 38. Then Jmmanuel said to him, \"Reach out and place your hand on my wounds, so that you of small mind may recognize the truth:' 39. So Thomas did as he had been told, and he touc hed his wounds and said, \"Truly, it is you.\" 40. Then Jmmanuel departed, saying, \"Guard the secret of my return, so it will not be known that I am alive. 41. And behold, the next da y the disciples set out for Galilee to spread the joyful news among Jmmanuel's supporters. 42. As other followers went along, behol d, an itinerant joined them and for part of the way walked with them. 43. They were sad and talked am ong themselves about how Jmmanuel had been forced to die on the cross. 44. Then the itinerant, a stranger, sa id to them, \"Why are you mourning?\" And they told him what grieved them. 45. But the itinerant said, \"How little knowledge you yet have; Jmmanuel told you he would rise from near-death after three days and nights. 46. \"So just as he has said, it has happened.” 47. After he had spoken he removed the cloth from his face and they recognized him as Jmmanuel. 48. But he said nothing more, and again covering his face, he withdrew.

Long after Jmmanuel had disappeared, it came to pass that the disciples were fishing on the Sea of Tiberias, 50. and they caught nothing the entire night, so by daybreak they were exasperated. 51. And when they approached the shore, there stood a stranger who asked, \"Haven't you anything to eat? I'm hungry.\" 52. They answered, \"No, we have not caught one fish in our nets.\" 53. Then the stranger said, \"Throw the net out to the right side of the boat, and you will have a large catch.\" 54. The disciples were astonished by wh at he said, but nevertheless cast the net. And behold, they could not pull it in because of the multitude of fish. 55. And they came ashore and prepared a meal, for like the stranger they, too, were hungry. 56. But when he uncovered his face, behold, it was Jmmanuel. 57. And while they were eating and in good spirits, he said to them, \"Go to Galilee to such-and-such mountain; there I will join you, because our time together has ended and each of us may go his separate way.” Chapter 32 Jmmanuel's Farewell 1. They went to the mountain to which Jmmanuel had directed them. 2. When they were gathered there, he said to them, \"Behold, I will speak to you one last time; then I will leave and never return. 3. \"My path leads me to the land of India where many of this human lineage also dwell, because they ha ve left this land to live there. 4. \"My mission leads me to them and to the human population that is born there.

But the ultimate goal should be this: 8. \"Everything human within human beings must die, but everything of Creation within them must rise and embrace Creation. 9. \"Consider the universe as the place wh ere Creation lives in infinity. 10. \"Everything humans possess has its origin in Creation; therefore it belongs to Creation. 11. \"Human beings shall transform thei r entire spiritual lives and perfect them, so that they will become one with Creation. 12. \"Whatever human beings do, they shall do with the awareness of Creation's presence. 13. \" But a human being shall never a ttempt to force the truth onto another, because then it would only be worth half its value. 14. \"First, humans shall tend to their own progress in consciousness and spirit, so as to produce Creational harmony within themselves. 15. \"No greater darkness rules within humans than ignorance and lack of wisdom. 16. \"Greatness of personal victory re quires uprooting and destroying all influences that oppose the Creational fo rce, so that which is Creational may prevail. 17. \"Humans should develop within themselves the power to judge over good and evil and to correctly perceive all things, so that they may be wise and fair and follow the laws. "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 137 18. \"It is necessary to be cognizant of what is real and what is unreal, what is valuable and what is worthle ss, and what is of Creation and what is not. 19. \"Human beings must become a cosmic unity, so that they can become one with Creation. 20. \"Conform your lives to the laws; liv e according to the laws of nature, then you will also live according to the laws of Creation. 21. \"Regardless of how much humans may suffer, the power of Creation within them is immeasurably greater, and it will conquer all ills. 22. \"When human beings live within their consciousness only as mortal humans, they are inaccessibl y remote from their spirit, from Creation and therefore from its laws. 23. \"The greater their dedication to the laws of Creation, the deeper will become the peace within them. 24. \"The happiness of humans consists in seeking and finding the truth, so they may thereby gather knowledge, gain wisdom, and think and act in accordance with Creation. 25. \"Only through the circumstances of human life can humans develop and use their Creational powers in consciousness and in spirit. 26. \"Humans gain experience in the use of their powers and capabilities only by trying daily to unlock them. 27. \"As long as human beings do not become one with Creation, they will never be able to rise above death or near-death, since the fear of the unknown is within them. Only when th ey are able to fully recognize the perfection and unity of Creation can they slowly begin to acquire sublimity. 28. \"instead of following instinctive and impulsive urges, humans should live by cognition and wisdom, so that they may live justly according to the laws and directives. 29. \"Humans should not lose their way in the thicket of limitations, but should expand their consciousness a nd seek and find knowledge, logic and truth, and from these learn wisdom."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 138 30. \"Thereby they will come closer to their life's goal and become cognizant of the Creational principle in all things. 31. \"Thousands of lights will guide humans along their path, provided they observe and follow them. 32. \"Human beings will attain all their knowledge and wisdom, provided they seriously strive for perfection. 33. \"The laws serve all those who ar e prepared to seek the truth in unlimited measure and to learn wisdom from them. 34. \"For in mastering all possible orie ntations within themselves, they develop their spiritual powers to highe r and higher levels , and in so doing they perfect themselves. 35. \"Humans should not attempt to dw ell upon their physical misery, but upon the reality of the spirit and the existence of Creation. 36. \"A continual restlessness exists w ithin humans, because they have a premonition that Creation is their fate and destination. 37. \"Humans may be great, wise and good, yet this is not sufficient, for they can always become greater, wiser and better. 38. \"There may be no limits to love, peace and joy, because the present state must always be exceeded. 39. \"Truly, I say to you, a love that is unlimited, constant and unfailing is unconditional and is a pure love, in whos e fire all that is impure and evil will burn. 40. \"Such a love is Creation's love a nd, therefore its laws as well, to which humanity has been predestined since the beginning of time. 41. \"Since this is the ultimate destin ation for human beings, they must take steps to guarantee that this will come to be, for this is their destiny. 42. \"But as yet humans do not understand the wisdom of this teaching, and therefore it is being adulterated everywhere on Earth. 43. \"In their ignorance, humans are fals ifying the teachings in many ways and forms, so that they are becoming diffused and unintelligible."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" 139 44. \" But in two times a thousand years they shall be taught anew without falsification, when humans become sensible and knowledgeable, and a new age heralds great upheavals. 45. \" And it can be read in the stars th at the people of the new age will be great revolutionaries. Thus, some special predestined people, who will be the new proclaimers of my teachings, will preach them unfalsified and with great courage. 46. \"But you, go therefore and prepar e the way for my teachings and make all peoples their disciples. 47. \"However, beware of false teachi ngs, which you may allow to arise because of your lack of judgment, for some of you are inclined that way. 48. \"Teach them to follow everything I have commanded you, so you do not falsify my teachings.\" 49. And it came to pass, that while he was speaking to them in this manner, a thundering came from the sky, and a great light descended. 50. The light settled on the ground not far from them, and it glittered like metal in the sunlight. 51. Jmmanuel spoke no more, but went to the metallic light and entered into it. 52. Then, however, a haze arose a ll around it. Once again a thundering began and the light ascended back into the sky. 53. And the disciples returned to Jeru salem in secret and made known the events among their own kind. Chapter 33 Jmmanuel In Damascus 1. Jmmanuel was set down by the great li ght in Syria, where he lived for two years in Damascus without being recognized. 2. After this time he sent a messenger to Galilee to seek out his brother, Thomas, and his disciple, Judas Iscariot."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 140 3. Two months passed, however, befo re they joined Jmmanuel and brought bad news. 4. His brother Thomas spoke, saying, \"Your disciples have greatly falsified your teachings; they insult you by calling you the son of God and they also set you equal to Creation. 5. \"The chief priests and elders pers ecute your followers and have them stoned when they are caught. 6. \"But Thomas, one of your disciples, fled, and it is reported that he has departed with a caravan for the land of India. 7. \"A great enemy of yours has arisen in a man named Saul. 8. \"He is fuming with rage and utters death threats against your disciples and those who trust in your teachings. 9. \"He is having letters written to th e synagogues in all regions, whereby if any followers of your new teachings are found, they will be bound and taken to Jerusalem. 10. \"No distinction is being made between women, men and children. They will all be found guilty and condemned to die.\" 11. But Jmmanuel said, \"Don't be afra id, the time will soon come when Saul will receive a lesson regarding his evil thinking. 12. \"He is already on the road to Damascus, following you and Judas Iscariot here now, in order to lead you back to Jerusalem in shackles. 13. \"However, I will confront him befo re he reaches Damascus, and since he believes me dead, he will presume he is seeing a ghost.\" 14. Jmmanuel set out to see a friend w ho was helpful to him in secret things that involved powders, salves and liquids that smelled bad. 15. Well supplied with these things, he departed, leaving the city by way of the road to Galilee. 16. A day's trip from Damascus, he waite d for two days in the rocks and prepared his concoction. "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 141 17. During the night he saw a large group of armed men coming, among them Saul, the persecutor of his disciples. 18. When they were near, he struck a fire and tossed it into his concoction, thus producing a powerfully bright light that blinded the group. 19. Jmmanuel continued stoking the flari ng concoction, so that powerful flashes of light, stars and fireballs shot into the sky or fell from it. All this was accompanied by thundering booms and loud hissing sounds, as if from gigantic dragons and serpents. 20. The thundering and booms subsided, as did the hissing. The blinding flashes and the multi-coloured fires died down, yet stinging smoke continued to cover the land and cause d the group to cough and shed tears. 21. Then Jmmanuel called out, \"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute my disciples?\" 22. But Saul was afraid and fell to the ground, crying out, \"Who are you who speaks to me like this?\" 23. And Jmmanuel answered, sayi ng, \"I am Jmmanuel whom you persecute in your hatred, along with my disciples. 24. \"Get up. Go into the city and let yourself be taught how you should live.\" 25. Saul was very afraid and said, \"But you are the one who was crucified. So you are dead and must be speaking to me as a ghost.\" 26. However Jmmanuel did not answer him. He left and headed for Damascus. 27. But the men who were Saul's companions stood still, petrified with fear, because they also believed they had heard a ghost. 28. Saul got up from the ground and opene d his eyes. However, he saw nothing because his eyes were blinded, for he had stared directly into the bright light Jmmanuel had generated. 29. His companions then took him by the hand and led him to Damascus, "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 142 30. and for three days he saw nothing, ate nothing and drank nothing. 31. However, one of Jmmanuel's discip les came to Saul and preached to him the new teachings, and gradually he accepted them. 32. But because of the events by the rocks, his mind was slightly confused. He misunderstood much and spoke incoherently. 33. Somewhat confused in his mind, he went away and preached incoherent nonsense to the people. 34. Jmmanuel, however, remained in Da mascus another thirty days and made it known that he would be leavi ng the country and travelling to the land of India. 35. His mother Mary came from Nazaret h and set out on the road to the land of India with Jmmanuel, his br other Thomas, and Judas Iscariot. 36. And Jmmanuel began to preach agai n and teach the people wherever he encountered them along the way and in any settlement he came to. 37. There was a new strength within him and his teachings were more powerful than before. Chapter 34 Teaching About Creation 1. Jmmanuel preached powerfully, sayi ng, \"Behold, Creation stands above humanity, above god and above everything. 2. \"It appears to be perfect by human comprehension, but this is not so. 3. \"Since Creation is spirit and thus lives, even it must forever perfect itself. 4. \"But since it is one within itself, it can perfect itself by way of its own creations, through the generation of ne w spirit forms that dwell within humans, give them life, and evol ve towards perfection through their learning. 5. \"The newly generated spirit is part of Creation itself; however, it is unknowing down to the smallest iota."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" 143 6. \" When a new spirit is created, whic h is still unknowing in every way, it lives in a human body and begins to learn . 7. \"Persons may consider the unknowing spirit as stupid and say that the individual is confused. 8. \"But it is not, because it is onl y unknowing and devoid of knowledge and wisdom. 9. \"Thus may this new spirit live a life within a human being in order to gather knowledge. 10. \"Then, when this spirit ente rs the beyond, it is no longer as unknowing as it was at the time of its beginning. 11. \"And it returns into the world and liv es again as a human being but is no longer quite as unknowing as it was at its beginning. 12. \"Again it learns and gathers fu rther knowledge and new wisdom, and thereby increasingly escapes from ignorance. 13. \"So, after many renewed lives, th e time comes when people say that this spirit is normal and not confused. 14. \"But this is neither the end of th e spirit nor its fulfilment, because, having become knowing, the spirit now seeks the greatest wisdom. 15. \"Thus, the human spirit perfects itself so extensively that it unfolds in a Creational manner and ultimately beco mes one with Creation, as it was destined from the earliest beginning. 16. \"Thus, Creation has brought forth a new spirit, allowing it to be perfected independently in the human body. The perfected spirit returns to Creation to become one with it, and in this manner Creation perfects itself within itself, for in it is the knowledge and wisdom to do so. 17. \"Truly, I say to you, the time will never come when Creation ceases to create new spirit forms and to broaden itself, 18. \"However, Creation also requires rest, a characteristic of all that lives, and when it slumbers it does not create. "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 144 19. \"Just as human life has day and night and is divided into work and rest, so Creation also has its times of work and rest. 20. \"Its period, however, is different fro m that of people, because its laws are the laws of the spirit, 21. \"while human laws are the laws of material life. 22. \"The material life is limited, but the life of the spirit lasts forever and knows no end. 23. \"Creation, however, is subject to the laws of Primeval-Timelessness and Primeval-Creation, which is the Absolute Absolutum and the beginning and endlessness of everything. And it was created out of itself 24 . 24. \" Its secret is that which is immeasurable and is based on the number seven, which is counted in 'times.' 25. \"This is one of the secrets and laws the human mind will solve only when it reaches perfection. 26. \"But let it be said that the laws of life are not hidden from the wise man, hence he can recognize and follow them. 27. \" Thus the wise understand that the secret of Primeval-Creation lies in the number seven and in computations based thereon. Thus they will gather and retain the knowledge that Creation has a time for work or rest that is also based upon the number seven. 28. \"Creation rested in a state of slumber for seven Great Times when nothing existed, not even the universe.   24 Absolute Absolutum: Most basic Creationa l level or most basic Absolutum level, respectively, of which there are seven. From the highest Absolutum level down to the lowest the following sequence is valid: BEING Absolutum, Zohar Absolutum, Super Absolutum, Creative Absolutum, Central Ab solutum, Ur-[= primal, original, prime] Absolutum, and Absolute Absolutum. Ou t of the Absolute Absolutum the first Creation form of the lowest kind was created - the material universe, the universal consciousness or universe in which We exist. This universe, universal consciousness, or Creation form, respectively, which is the first and lowest of all 1049 Creation forms, has created out of itself all Creational energies, i.e., all spirit energies and Spirit forms. It is therefore the crea tion of its own Ur-source.

It came to pass that Jmmanuel, his mother Mary, and his brother Thomas travelled on into the cities at the sea in the north. Since olden times, warrior women inhabited the ar ea, but their descendants were now peace loving."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 148 2. He preached to them the new teachings according to his knowledge but had to flee their cities when they attempted to kill him. 3. Their own teachings, far removed from truth, were from a rigid religious cult; and they punished with death those who taught differently. 4. Jmmanuel was treated as an outcast by these people and persecuted as an agitator against their cult. So he fled. 5. It came to pass during his flight that he met up with a large caravan. He and his following joined it and continued inland and into the mountains. 6. They travelled through the central part of the country for many weeks whereupon they came to another sea and into the city of Ephesus. 7. But Jmmanuel was very much afraid, and no longer preached his new teachings so that no one would rec ognize him; for in Ephesus were many people--dealers and merchants, w ho came there from Jerusalem to conduct business. 8. Many among them had known Jmma nuel and had not been well disposed toward him; therefore he avoided them and obscured his face. 9. The dealers and merchants in E phesus had spread the story of Jmmanuel and his purported death, wh ich had occurred two-and-one-half years earlier. 10. However, after he had been in the city for a few days, behold, he was recognized by one of the merchants who informed others of like belief. They belonged to a secret group called the Association of the Essenes. 11. They brought Jmmanuel to a meeting that was secret, for they feared the people because their secret so ciety was considered unlawful. 12. But among them was one named Juthan , the most senior of the secret society in Jerusalem, and he spoke, saying, 13. \"Behold, we know very well what has taken place in your life, but we do not understand how you can still be among the living.

Juthan, the eldest, said, \"Behold, we belong to a secret group called the Association of the Essenes. 17. \"Our quest and knowledge are not attuned to the teachings of the scribes, but to the secrets of nature a nd all that is inexplicable to humans. 18. \"You are great in your knowledge, and by all measures you have advanced in knowledge far beyond us and the scribes, Pharisees, astrologers, even the elders and the philosophers. 19. \"Therefore, come join our society, be one of us and teach us your knowledge.\" 20. But Jmmanuel answered, saying, “E ven if I were to teach you my knowledge, it would not agree with your teachings, because you follow incomplete human wisdom, whereas I adhere to spiritual wisdom. 21. \"Therefore, I think that our differe nt teachings would be incompatible with each other. 22. \"It is also not my inclination to spread my knowledge and teachings in secret, as you do, since your secret Association of Essenes is unauthorized. 23. \"But let me think over the pros a nd cons for three days, and whether I will then tell you 'yes' or 'no', because I must first think about everything before I give you my last word on it.\" 24.

And as we also know Albe rt Meier also received the final explanatory letter from Isa Rashid around the same time, which was posted shortly before Isa Rashid’s assassination in Baghdad.

What happened after the crucifixion event was that J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l , H H H i i i s s s mother Mary, and H H H i i i s s s bother Thomas travelled to Northern India. And to make the most out of the journey J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l stopped at many countries along the way to preach to anyone that would listen. In-fact because of all the stopping and preaching, it took J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l , Mary and Thomas several years to arrive in India. And the journey was arduous, as we are told that J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l ’ ’ ’ s s s mother, Mary, became ill and died in the We stern Himalaya during Jmmanuel’s 38 th year. Though J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l continued onwards and travelled to what is now known as India’s Kashmir region, where H H H e e e furthered H H H i i i s s s T T T e e e a a a c c c h h h i i i n n n g g g s s s . In-fact J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l visited many parts of India, including West Pakistan, and Northern India. In H H H i i i s s s 45 th year J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l married, and it is said H H H e e e bore numerous children when H H H e e e settled down in Srinagar in the Kashmir region of India. And from this base he ventured out upon numerous trips to further H H H i i i s s s teachings. It is said that J J J m m m m m m a a a n n n u u u e e e l l l died of natural cau ses somewhere between H H H i i i s s s 110th and H H H i i i s s s 115 th year, and that H H H e e e was buried in Srinagar. It is also said that Judas Iscariot was also buried near to Srinagar in his 90 th year.

And also, it seems, after Joseph also released a copy of his own finalised version which found it’s way into the hands of the apostle Mathew. And so, the original S S S c c c r r r o o o l l l l l l s s s penned by Judas remained in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea until they were re-d iscovered by Isa Rashid and Albert Meier in 1963.

That has its reason in my fears which unfortunately have come true now. As I always told you, 1 was prepared that one day I would be persecuted on account of the discovered scrolls. Th at has happened no w. Just barely was I able to flee from Jerusalem with my family. Now I am staying with good friends in Baghdad where, howev er, I cannot stay long and must move on soon. Where to, I don't know yet, bur I will notify you as soon as possible. I have been persecuted by two different groups, both Christians and Jews, which was to be anticipated, becau se the scrolls are not favourable towards either religion. After my lu cky escape a misfortune struck me, which cannot be made undone. First I fled from Jerusalem to Lebanon and stayed there at a refugee camp with my family. But there the Jews located me and, with their military, attacked the camp, which resulted in many deaths. Only with great difficu lty my family and I escaped the massacre and we were able to fl ee once more. But unfortunately all scrolls got lost and they are no longer in my possession. I believe they all burned when the Jews destroyed the homes by fire, but maybe they fell into the hands of the Jews? Then the Israelis announced that they had undertaken a punitive action against Palestinian guerrillas. However, in reality, they, together with some people from the Christian church, were after me and my scrolls. By means of the alleged punitive action th ey were now able to cover up and falsify the actual reason and purpose of their venture. And because of the disappearance of the original scrolls , any proof is missing that the New Testament of the Bible is an outrageous lie whereby mankind is condemned."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 158 Dear friend, unfortunately these are th e latest bare fact s and I do hope that you and your family will not meet with the same fate as I.

Therefore be very cautious and see to it that those few existing teachings of Jmmanuel will not get lost . They are really too valuable. I for my part do withdraw from th e whole matter because I cannot endanger my family even more. Ther efore keep my name and everything else a secret on the occasion of publi cation.

I will add that I originally offered to travel to Switzerland to translate a lifetimes worth of non-linear researches to Albert Meier, but after sending many e-mails to all members of Al bert Meier’s F.I.G.U. group all I found was for some strange reason that I received only one answer back. Yes just one reply, which told me that ‘Billy no longer meets anybody’. And when I answered that e-mail, pointing out that the ‘Steelmark’ forum is full of stories about people visiti ng him on a regular basis, and that perhaps the sender had ma de some sort of mistake, I never received a reply to that e-mail either! But then who wants to launch into a negative debate? Not me, that’s for sure. Because of this, I will still fly into any country, including Switzerland, if F.I.G.U. ever decide to change their mind; but for now I will present a powerful example of the scope of ‘ The Sign Of Jonah ’ teachings right here.

The group had decided that Philip would be an aristocrat in Cromwellian England, and that he would have lived in th e middle of the seventeenth century. For a period of one whole year this group met once a week to lend more b b b e e e l l l i i i e e e f f f O to the advent of Philip. They e xpanded their account of his habits, dress-sense, life-style, and demeanour with greater and greater detail. Yet, in all this time there was no sign of Philip. No ‘table knocking’, no ‘spooky sounds’, and no dream-plane or meditational ‘visitations’. It seemed that the initial techniques that the Toronto Society were using were not ‘making them a man’. O O h h h d d d e e e a a a r r r ... ... ... Then, one day one of the member s of the Psychic Research Team happened to come across the writings of a man called K.J. Batcheldor, who had also investigated into the subject of ‘making him a man 26 ’. This particular researcher suggested ‘making a man’ out of SONGS, and   26 To be honest, this sort of tying was neve r any great secret until modern Westernised ‘society’ came along. Many Yogis and occultis ts alike are perfectly capable of ‘making them a man’ to ‘watch over’ their friends [or even spy on an enemy] and then report back. Some witches do this also, and call such a life-form a ‘familiar’ [John Grau, 2006]."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 162 POEMS, and HUMOUR and RELAXED-EXPECTANCY. The Toronto Society immediately switched their approach. They wrote music and poetry about the advent of Philip, as well as telling numerous-but-friendly jokes about his ‘coming’.

They often write about fa iled love affairs, abject misery, terrible calamities, or fantasy-land acts of heroicness. But they almost never direct their A A A R R R T T T at sorting out the physical world that we all walk about in every day. You S S S E E E E E E , after discovering the very method of ‘making them a man’, the Toronto Society were focussing their ma g ical rh y mes in a ver y s p ecific direction - namely, ‘making them a man’.

Though later this changed, a nd Philip took on a definite individual character .

He had found out how to change from a man into a woman, a nd had even found a way of slipping through the atoms of space to make hi s very own Realm to live in.

Here Carlos has been p ulled into the intended Realm of the Death Defier, and has met some of the peoples in the Death Defier’s Realm: “Daringly, I even grabbed a couple of people, whom I seemed to scare considerably .

I bet you won’t believe me if I tell you that this town you are looking at now doesn’t really exist, outside your intent and mine ”... Of-course ‘reasons’ shift as linear noti ons of ‘time’ pass.

Later, at the point that Carlos also B B B E E E L L L I I I E E E V V V E E E D D D in that Realm, Carlos was told that now both he and the Death Defier were responsible for all those lives, buildings, dreams and aspirations.

Currently I am ‘believing’ about N.E.S.A.R.A. coming to every countr y 39 on the P P P l l l a a a n n n e e e t t t E E E a a a r r r t t t h h h . And I am also believing in the removal of all the world’s corrupt judges, politicians, and lawyers too: amongst many, many other things. Now, I was also going to say 40 that: \"I have now completely stopped reading anything negative at all on the internet, such as the ‘same old’ 911 st ories, and the various given reasons for the delays in Global N.E.S.A.R.A. Since if I do ‘believe’ in such things [which I can not ], then I partly made the very things that I ‘believed’ all about. This is not to say that such knowledges are not useful at first , if you are ‘coming from nowhere ’, and building up your personal account of ‘how it was’, and ‘how it is’. But, at an inter - dimensional level , all that such knowledges are, are the very ‘spells’ [beliefs] that made the very things that we all despise happen in the first place.

The height of this egg is equal to th e length of a man’s body with his arms fully extended above his head on the vertical axis, and its width is that of a man with his arms extended outwards from the centre of his body along the horizontal axis.

Big deal - let's get all our 'fibres of light' back now. We can ‘leave’ threads of light attached to objects at our work places, to lovers , to people we brush against whilst walking in busy streets, to buildings in our home countries, and even to buildings on holiday, etc, etc. Which really means th at these threads of light can attach themselves to anything we have touched. And by the same token, other people can attach their threads of light to our auras too. In itself none of this needs to be cons idered as a problem, as it is just how it is. However, in the case of leaving some of your t t t h h h r r r e e e a a a d d d s s s o o o f f f l l l i i i g g g h h h t t t attached to an angry or con-fused or even diseased person; or also in the case of leaving some of your t t t h h h r r r e e e a a a d d d s s s o o o f f f l l l i i i g g g h h h t t t attached to the walls of a place that is [for exampl e] mouldy or very cold: then we may indeed find that returning our lost threads to our own aura will make us feel healthier and more complete. Returning our lost threads can also make our mind much stiller, because if we have left threads [for example] attached to con -fused or a a a n n n g g g r r r y y y people, then we can receive these thoughts of other people as our own. This being since our own threads will act like #radio- transmitters’ back to our own aura.

We can use the ‘ S S S w w w e e e e e e p p p i i i n n n g g g B B B r r r e e e a a a t t t h h h ’ when we are walking about, when we are sitting, or when we are laying down – depending on how busy we are.

This is just fine, and I can tell you all that I do this too sometimes with those that I like and trust the most too. Here I am discussing ways of recycling back to us our own fibres of light that have become entangled with angry, ill, confused, etc, etc, people, and also cold or mouldy buildings and objects, etc, etc. As a further expansion of this technique, the B B B r r r i i i t t t i i i s s s h h h T T T o o o l l l t t t e e e c c c P P P a a a r r r t t t y y y make it clear that many occult books in form the reader that the ‘ h h h e e e i i i g g g h h h t t t o o o f f f y y y o o o g g g a a a ’ is to imagine ourselves growing bigge r and bigger, indeed to ‘become as the Solar Logos’.

Of course, with the ‘ S S S w w w e e e e e e p p p i i i n n n g g g B B B r r r e e e a a a t t t h h h ’ in the back of your mind all day , and with you also going about your daily busin ess, I am only asking you to be in two places at one time .

So, I am not asking you to multi-locate into four hundred places at one time, like the best lady dreamer could do in the Carlos Castaneda series of books. I am only asking you to be conscious of just two! Did you know that the founding technique of ALL time-space manipulation is that of Yoga... And we now know that this Yoga is nothing more than [ [ [ 1 1 1 ] ] ] shifting your consciousness so that you ‘become solely as some other thing’, or so that you [ [ [ 2 2 2 ] ] ] ‘become as some other thing’ and also remain conscious of yourself as you go about your daily business.

All I have done here is to presen t the temporal part of the Toltec Teachings of the M M M a a a s s s t t t e e e r r r T T T h h h é é é u u u n n n M M M a a a r r r e e e s s s in an accessible and animated format so that anybody [such as those with no money to buy four books] can understand the dynamics of what He wanted the world to understand. I will add at this point that the M M M a a a s s s t t t e e e r r r T T T h h h é é é u u u n n n M M M a a a r r r e e e s s s has now offered on His own web-site, to turn over all the Toltec researches, in a very ordered and academic manner, to the world’s Scientists, and to any interested University Faculty. And so, if you know a Professor or a Department that would be interested in such a systematic study of Mankind’s Universe Of Mind, then please, please, pass this message onto them. For example, I would love to hear of a Department of Psychiatry/ Psychology that adopts such knowledges. Though, there are, of course, many more ‘directions’ that this particular kind of research could be applied to. Oh, and I'd personally love an editor of any spiritual mag azine, or even a local [or national] newspape r to run this article. You S S S E E E E E E , like the M M M a a a s s s t t t e e e r r r T T T h h h é é é u u u n n n M M M a a a r r r e e e s s s , I also would like everybody to understand these important temporal principles as soon as is humanly possible.
