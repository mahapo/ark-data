I learned independently to translate and study the prophetic writings and judicial astrology of Dr. M i- chel de Nostradamus, and to harvest astrologically - relevant content from the psychic readings of Ed gar Cayce — all with ardent enthu siasm. I studied classic al Greco - Roman m y thol ogy, which, in light of my bi ble studies and my practice of Nosty’ s and Cayce’s judicial astrology, ki n dled my in terest in Tarot, and among other enterprises encouraged me to write this book . I was fortunate eno ugh to have a musical and mathematical upbringing. My mother a n a c- complished p i anist , and my father an engineer. Thus m ath, music , and pattern - recognition in general has al ways come easily for me. There’ s a fundamental correlation between as tro n omy and ast rology, mythology and tarot. And t his is to recognize that music and mathematics co n- nects the whole to gether. N ot only in theory, but verily in the real - world , through personal exper i ence and increasing psychic awareness . At the end of this book, I’ve incl uded all 78 of my original tarot cards, which can be cut to size on any standard paper cutter. These cards can be used as “flash cards” for instru c tional purposes, and can be used as a true set of tarot cards for professional - quality tarot rea d ings. Enjoy !

The seasoned practitioner of tarot may use this ma r velous and powerful tool to communicate with spirits of the dead , or to predict future events, else for more traditional rea d- ings of the present, past and f u ture — by its revelation in the cards. You may ask questions of the spirits of the tarot, and receive answers by shuffling and drawing cards from the deck , or ask your client to do the same. Really, the only limit for how you can use the tarot is the limit you have imposed on it, not it on you. Be creative, spontan e- ous, above all be yourself. Be confident in your innate God - given abilities. Find the method that works best for you and use it, develop it, learn to master your techniques. The usefulness of tarot can be st be appreciated by laying down some ground rules first, so that a s you gain familiarity with tarot, you can build your ps y chic house of knowledge on a firm foundation of scientific facts & astronomical truths, beginning with the universal princ i- ples of c ause and effect, action and reaction. These form the basis of life itself, of all exi s tence. For example, consider light and darkness, as in contrast to itself, as with white against black. How do we know that something has light, if not by noticing the ab sence of light, i.e. darkness? This is commonly symbolized by the yin and yang, the feminine and masculine a s- pects or forces of the universe, energies which both contrast with and complement each other simply and profoundly, passively and actively, “ weakly ” and “ strongly ” . The keyword here is completely. Yin or yang, by themselves, are incomplete thus are i n- separable since the universe is complete as everything in the universe is part of itself, all part of One. Do you know your right hand from your left ha nd? Of course you do. Clasp your hands together and see how they naturally interlock as if one fist. The wife and husband are joined together as one, as the circle which holds the yin & yang is one, even as the planets of our solar system are one. Ten plan ets, heavens and spheres, as one sy s tem. And so we ’ ve established this first ground rule for learning and using tarot: Interconnecti v- ity! Synchronicity! Our primary rule states that all existence in the universe is interco n nected, in some way or another — ways we can ’ t even ima g ine, but also in ways that we can study & understand. Let us rejoice that we ’ re all a part of the One. We ’ ll call this our LAW OF ONE like Edgar Cayce used to talk about in his psychic readings. For contrast against the One, we ’ ll ca ll it BABYLON, also in honor of Edgar Cayce as he used to call children of fragmented philosophy the “ children of Belial ” , or as this ancient word “ lbb ” means ben Babel, “ the children of co n- fusion by mixing ” . It ’ s all in the bible. You can look it up later . T"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ground Rules 2 As our first ground rule, we ’ ll acknowledge our at - one - ment with the un i verse, giving thanks to its Creator and the Gods who are altogether One. This is fundamental to unde r- standing how to use the tarot, since every one of the seventy - eight cards in the deck has a d e- finitive relationship with the other, each b e ing precisely defined by astronomical truths and astrological deductions, by the divine Law singing the quintessential music of the spheres. This makes a good invocation before beginning a session o f tarot readings, e.g., the Muses who sing and are of One mind and One voice as One divine symphony praising the i m mortal Gods & Goddesses, lead us in thy modes of truth and songs of love. You may even want to sing it, or chant a mantra in the language of your choice ... it ’ s up to you. It can be any words or songs of your choosing said aloud or in silence as long as you say som e thing kind in the presence of God who is everywhere always. Give thanks in whatever way you are comfortable with. Remember you must as k for divine guidance. Ask and ye shall r e ceive. Knock, and the door opens. Have faith that the divine power will guide you. Say a prayer for your clients in their presence. It doesn ’ t have to be religious, just heartfelt and d e- liberate . Practice tarot in good faith and you ’ ll succeed. If you doubt that T arot can help, then it ’s likely that you’ ll fail to get any helpful or veracious reading from the cards. Show faith by works and be confident the Gods can help you. Keep this in mind while reading the cards . In the next lesson, we ’ ll practice the ten - card spread by using the ancient tree of life la y out. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 3 Chapter 2 Tree of Life T HE TEN - CARD ancient “ tree of life ” layout is among the easiest to learn and most effe c tive procedure for casting a tarot reading, but is by no means the only layout you should try using . I prefer the ten - card layout , since it’ s generally in keeping with the traditional kabalah, the ten “ ineffable sephiroth ” to quote the Sepher Yetzirah , an ancient scrip ture reportedly based on the wo rk of the sovereign astrologue Abraham — which it most likely is, considering its highly pr o found and astrologically - accurate context. The ten positions of the cards in the tree of life layout are clearly defined, and are also d i- rectly associated with the ten planets, the ten, heavenly spheres of d i vine consciousness called the ten sephiroth, as previously noted. While the pla n ets are examined in more detail in later chapters, this chapter will help you to get started with laying out a tarot spread using th e tree of life as our layout template. There are some excellent graphical depictions of the tree of life available on the internet and in books, but unfortunately, none of them are completely accurate regarding the planetary positions. The following chart is entirely correct, and is depicted using simple ASCII text:"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Tree of Life 4  8  A {Kether}  Uranus STAR / Aeolian \\ / Infinity \\ / \\ 2 ------------------- 9 B B {Binah} {Hochma} Mercury Neptune MAGICIAN HERMIT Locrian Locrian In tellect Wisdom | | 7 ------------------- 6 G F {Gevurah} {Chesed} Saturn Jupiter (JUDGMENT,west) (EMPEROR,north) Mix olydian Lydian Judgment Charity | \\ / | | \\ 3 / | | \\ C / | | {Tipharet} | | Venus | | EMPRE SS | | Ionian | | /Beauty \\ | | / \\ | | / \\ | 4 ------------------- 5 D E {Hod} {Netzach} Sun Mars (SUN,east) (TOWER,south) Dorian Phrygian Majesty Victory \\ 1 / \\ A / \\ {Yesod} / Moon  MOON Aeolian Foundation  | 10  C {Malchut} Pluton  FOOL  Ionian Center"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Min’s Compleat Tarot Manual 5 The cards are shuffled. Whether or not you want to include inverted or “ reversed ” cards in your tarot is simply a matter of personal preference. I reco m mend placing all cards upright no matter if they ’ re initially deal t inverted or not. You will find it easier to learn what you are d o- ing. Later, as you gain experience in tarot readings, you may wish to accommodate card reve r- sals, and read them as you see fit. By not using them you will find it less confusing, and easier to read, and certainly less intimidating to your clients. Personally, I ’ m not convinced that it makes any difference if a card is dealt reversed, just as any astrological chart has only an upright view. Some tarot rea d ers associate the inverted cards with planets in retrograde, but only ten of the seventy - eight cards in the tarot deck re p resent planets in the first place and more importantly, the ten planets refer to its sidereal pos i tions, but not synodic position as would - be retrograde planets. This prin ciple is thoroughly e x- plained in later chapters. For now, try casting a chart using the above tree of life layout. You should shuffle your cards at least once before dealing them. Be aware that some tarot readers use only the major arcana, while others pre fer the minor arcana, and may use an ordinary deck of playing cards in place of the 56 - card minor arcana (the “ pages ” of the elements a c- count for extra cards). I recommend using the entire 78 - card tarot deck at all times for doing rea d ings since each card has a very specific astrological meaning, which the major or minor arcana alone can not account for. Again, this is explained in later chapters. Also, if you ’ re reading for someone else, it is customary to allow your client to cut the cards into three smal ler piles then select the middle pile of cards and set all the other cards aside (i.e. assuming at least ten cards in the middle pile or else you must borrow from another pile). Once you have the cards in hand, deal ten cards in the following order. Do not , I repeat do NOT deviate from this order, or your reading may be in error. How do we know this? B e cause the tree of life is made by paths from one heaven to the next, and in a very specific o r der at its fundamental roots. You can change the order of the p aths, but then you must change the co r- responding planetary positions accordingly . E.g., you place the first card in the position of the Moon if you like, then place the second card in the position of Mercury, etc. Just make sure that the position of the pl anets does NOT deviate from the charts on the preceding and follo w- ing page. In any case, I recommend laying out only one card at a time, and always read it a c- cording to its planetary position, then proceed to the next . NOTE: the planets shown in parenthese s correspond to the planetary position of that card, not the card i t self .

One by one as you deal them out in the above “ tree of life ” layout, you ’ ll learn the basic meanings from reading the follo w- ing chapters on the planets and signs, the houses and horoscopes, since that ’ s exa ctly what the T arot represents. As in the above layout, the first planet is Uranus who is associated with “ new beginnings ” , and the card that conjuncts Uranus indicates a planet, or caelestial sign, or a house of the horoscope, or other meaning depending o n the card that you ’ ve placed here. For example, you may have placed the “ Empress ” in this first position, meaning V e nus, sphere of hope, beauty, justice and equilibrium, she is adding hope & beauty to this new beginning for Uranus, playing her major Ionia n modality to Uranus ’ natural minor Aeolian. Try playing these modes on a piano or other keyboard, and you can immediately hear how these compl e- ment each other by switching between minor & major. Much, much more c ould be said of Venus conjunct Uranus, but I ’ ll say it simply for now. You ’ ll should study the following cha p- ters if you want to learn judicial “tarot - astrology” basics. Armed with this knowledge, then you’ll be read ing the se cards faster and more meaning fully for your family, friends and clients . The following three chart s are provided for convenient reference to a common piano ke y- board, since these list their precise correspondence s using classic “ tarot - astrology” nomencl a- ture in the seven diatonic modes of the sidereal planetary orbits about the Sun (solars) and the twelve chromatic tones of the synodic planetary orbits or phases to the Earth (lunaires). Just remember that the seven, fixed diatonic modes are trans posable across the twelve fixed chr o- matic tones in each o c tave, thereby producing the eighty - four unique key signatures of the Gods ( ref. complete “ 84 key sign a tures ” chart s and associated charts in chapter 9 ):"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Tree of Life 8  _ _ | | _ _ _ _ __ _(_)_ _ ___ ___ | |_| || | ‘ \\ / _` | | ‘_/ -

The orbits of the planets are called the “ Solars ” , meaning sidereal orbits, the orbital period with respect to distant stars.

Mercury ’ s high density (5.44) is second only to Earth (5.50), and has an equatorial diam e- ter of about 3,031 miles (4,878km; cf. Earth at 12,756km or 7,926 miles). The element Me r- cury, aka quicksilver, is alchemically associated with quick - mindedness and inco n stancy like Mercury ’ s untamed locrian modality whose taming comes by Neptune on Mercury ’ s di a tonic octave. From Mercury, the apparent size of the Sun ’ s fiery disc varies, 1.1 to 1.6 degrees due to Mercury ’ s eccentric orbit — that is, two to three times larger than the Sun appears to Earth. O what a fearful sight that would be to behold. Mercur y, Hermes, the cleverest and oft - most deceptive of the Olympian Gods with winged sandals and caduceus in hand. Hermes son of Zeus and the most beautiful of the Pleiades, Maia (04Tau53 ’ 25 ” +4:23 ’ 25 ” J2000), who is clustered together with her sisters near 5 degrees Taurus. Hermes, the God of boundaries, landmarks, and guideposts; the God of trade, co m- merce, and metro l ogy. Mercury ’ s persuasive often deceptive speech is common to political and business acumen, the home and social life, thus Hermes is the God of thieves and deception, cunning, conni v- ing, popularly known as the “ Trickster ” or Magician of the Major Arcana. Hermes is deemed God of epic literature and oratory, also God of athletics. In ancient times, statues of Hermes were often placed at crossroads to bestow blessings and guidance on tra - velers. It was the duty of travelers to place a stone at roadsigns, to help i m- prove the roads and make them more passable for future travelers. Thereby the Greek word for the built - up stone landmarks became he r maion , in honor of Hermes. As with each new undertaking, the ancient Greeks would seek the counsel from Hermes and doctors of med i- cine have prayed to Mercury ever since.

In Greek, Kallio peia means “ fine - voiced ” , since Hermes i n- vented the kithara(lyre), syrinx from reeds (pan - flute), and some say fire perhaps due to his proximity to the Sun.  #III THE EMPRESS ________________________ Trump: THE EMPRESS Planet: Venus Roman: VENERIS Greek: Aphrodite Sphere: Beauty Synodic: 583.9 Sidereal: 224.70/0.615 Heaven: Third Arc ana: III Pitch: C > C Species: greater natural Order: W - W - H - W - W - W (7) Mode: Treble Ionian Muse: Terpsichore Goddess: Dance ___________________ _____ The tarot card of The Empress symbolizes the third sidereal heaven of V e nus, the sphere of beauty, perfection & balance. Her muse is Terpsichore, or greater natural Ionian modality (a n- cient Lydian), who begins the third order of the heavens which is Venus, Sun, Mars, Jup i ter, Saturn, Moon, & Mercury, in that order. Souls incarnate from the Venus souljourn are nat u- rally loving, patient, kind, me r ciful, and appreciative. Venusians love love, love all that is beautiful and refined, as gestalt or synergy in the arts, symmetry, natural - beauty. Terpsichore is muse of “ the dance ” , or one who participates to the music of the spheres. Venus transceives her graceful, beautiful and well - balanced particip a tion upon the resonant octave of her greater perfect Ionia n mode with Pluton - Hades. Venus is the second planet out from the Sun at a mean (semi - major axis) orbital distance of 0.723332 AU (108,208,930km). Notably, where Venus is suff i ciently elongated from the Sun and the sky is crystal - clear, Venus can barely b e seen with the naked eye in broad da y- light in drier or desert climates and lower air pollution as in pre - modern times. At 12,103.6 km in equatorial diameter, Venus is nearly the same size as Earth (12,756.3 km). Venus r o-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Min’s Compleat Tarot Manual 15 tates clockwise along her axis (loo king south), instead of counterclockwise like Earth and the other planets. Venus rotates very slowly, and spins “ up - sidedown ” on her slight axial inclin a- tion tilted 2.64* (i.e. nearly perpendicular to her heliocentric orbital plane), so is in perpetual re trograde rotation at approximately 177.4*. One 360* sidereal - day of Venus equals - 243.0187 (retrograde) solar earth - days, longer than her sidereal - year @ 225 earth - days, so one solar - day on Venus equals about 117 earth - days. With respect to Venus, the mor ning Sun would appear to rise in the west instead of the east, but only under her ambient light, never by d i rect sunlight, since Venus is perpetually covered by heavy clouds — clouds so thick it ’ s impossible to see her surface from above. This dense overca st is co m posed mainly of sulfuric acid reaching 35 miles above her surface (the highest clouds on Earth reach 10 miles for comparison). These clouds are fast moving, circling the entire planet in about four earth days. The composition of Venus ’ incredibly dense atmo s- phere is about 96% carbon dioxide, & 3% nitrogen, and n o tably with only trace amounts (0.003%) of water vapor. Venus appears as a pale sulphur - yellowish disc, beautifully photographed in mosaic by the Mariner 10 spacecraft back in 1974. Then the images returned from the Magellan spac e craft in 1990 revealed deep reddish, orangish, and yellowish high - lights on the planet ’ s su r face, where her daily temperature averages about 870*F (452*C) because of the clouds trapping solar heat, creating a highly - efficient Venusian greenhouse effect with intense atmo s pheric pressure at the surface 90+ Earth - atmospheres — that ’ s over 1300 psi! Although the cloud layers spin around above the surface like a hurricane there is little wind velocity down at the surface itself, with no rainfall or oceans whatsoever since the pressure repels the su l phuric rain droplets cycling among the clouds like virga — a far cry from what orthodox academia e x- pected to find up there. For example, in his book, ‘ Asimov on Astronomy ’ (pub. in 1974 Do u- bleday; cf. ‘ Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus ’ first published in 1954 ibid), Asimov acknowledges the unex - pectedly hot atmosphere of Venus as follows: “ We [now] know that it is dreadfully hot (hot enough to melt lead!), dread - fully dry wi th an unbreathable a t mosphere of carbon dioxide that is dreadfully thick ” . Decades earlier in 1950 Immanuel Velikovsky a n- ticipated that Venus would reveal surprisingly greater surface temperature than anyone prev i- ously expected. Greek Aphrodite translates as “ foam - born ” , raised up out of a handful of dust and se a- foam ... as Kronus castrated Ouranos and cast his cosmic testicles into Earth ’ s ocean, combi n- ing stardust and spittle (cf. Aphrodisias, sexual); see chapter one of Genesis in the old testament, the sixt h and last day of creation is Venus ’ Day, the mode of humankind ’ s creating. Aphrodite was worshipped as “ Goddess of the Sea ” by ancient seafarers who relied heavily on stars for navigation. Homer refers to Venus as daughter of Zeus & Dione, and the fickle spouse of the lame blacksmith God, Hephaistos (Lat. Vulcan)."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Ten Heavens 16 Aphrodite ’ s most powerful lover is Ares, and so she is said to be mother of Anteros, Eros, Harmonia, Phobos, and Deimos by their father Mars (see Lesson #V The Tower) Aphrodite is also said to be mother of Aeneas and Lyrus by Anchises, and Hermaphroditus by Hermes, Eryx by Poseidon, also Priapus by Dionysus. V e nus is the most beautiful promoter of fertility, and patron goddess of prost i tutes (in the vulgar sense when you stop and think about it). Her numerous epithets i n clude Anadyomene, sea - born; Genetrix, creator; Eupoloios, meaning fair voyage; and Pandemos of all people. Her Empress traits are shared by middle - eastern, & eas t- ern fertility Goddesses, particularly Astarte, & Ishtar (cognate to I ’ star for which Easter is named, cf. the bright morning star ... of Bethlehem). Hence, the ankh, astrological symbol for Venus, is engraved in the garden tombe of Joseph of Aramaethea located outside the ancient gates of Damascus (just north of old Jer u salem). Ishtar is the one great Goddess of the heaven in Babylonian mythology — verily the E m- press. The Greek myths of Aphrodite similarly reflect life ’ s cyclic nature, that the Gods often engage in divine “ conflict ” out of which the Gods i n carnate to live and die again and again throughout the grand cycles of life accor d ing to the divine purpose of creation. Greeks were powerfully attracted to Aphrodite as the goddess whose love & hope resurrects her lover out of the depths of Hades.  #IV THE SU N ________________________ Trump: THE SUN Planet: Sun Roman: SOLIS/Apollo Greek: Apollon/Helios Sphere: Majesty Synodic: n/a Sid ereal: 365.26/1.000 Heaven: Fourth Arcana: IV Pitch: D > C Species: lesser melodic Order: W - H - W - W - W - H (7) Mode: Dorian Muse: Melpomene Goddess: Tragedy ________________________ The tarot card of The Sun symbolizes the fourth sidereal heaven of Sol, the sphere of strength, power and majesty.

The Sun is average as middle - aged yellow stars go but is near e nough to the Earth to pr o- ject a magnitude of minus 26.8. At 886k miles mean equatorial d i ameter, the Sun is half - way between the largest and the smallest observable stars, so is classified common yellow spectrum class G2V. The sidereal rotation period of t he Sun is slower at the poles than it is at the equ a- tor, variable between thirty - six days down to twenty - five days respectively above the conve c- tive zones, with 25.38 days clear down to the core. In synodic terms, this breaks down to about 26.8 days at th e solar equator, 28.2 days at 30* solar latitude, 30.8 days at 60* latitude, 31.8 days at 75*. The mean synodic rotation number of the Sun (Carrin g ton) is ~27.2753 days. At the solar core, temperatures are believed to reach up to fifteen million degrees Ke lvin; cooler on the surface at 5800 K, sunspot umbra 4240 K, penumbra 5680 K, chromo - sphere between 4300 to 50,000 K & corona between 800,000 to 3,000,000 K. All this energy creates immense pressure at the core estimated at 340,000,000,000 (billion) Earth - atmospheres i.e. nearly 5,000,000,000,000 (tri l lion) psi. When viewed through filters, the Sun appears to glow red - orange with a fiery, flaming edge, but is far too hot to maintain permanent surface features — its luminous sphere in a perpetually energe tic gaseous state composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. The energy of the Sun comes from nuclear fission, or its conversion of hydrogen to helium which energy migrates up to the surface and rad i ates out into space as extra - radioactive solar wind. Solar f lares occur without warning, sending billions of particles out into space. This solar radiation is what prevents manned missions into outer space beyond the Van Allen Belt. See? At birth, Zeus presented Apollon with a cap, a lyre, and a chariot drawn by sa cred swans, who circled seven times around the island of Delos whence Apollo was born on the seventh day of the month Bysios, var.

Notably Moses ’ souljourn was the Sun. Likewise, Apollo was regarded as the powerfu l God of law and order. Moses & Apollo are competing for the same God. Thus the number seven and seven swans are held sacred by Apollo, who is depicted as wearing a crown of seven rays. But rather than being fed mother ’ s milk he was nou r ished with sweet ne ctar and quickly threw off his baby clothes to assume his manly form. The myth co n- tinues that Apollo set forth with his bow and arrow, in search of sanctuary. He settles in a mountain gorge where awaits the terrible dragon Python who ’ d been summoned there in o r- der to kill Apollo ’ s mother, Leto. Instead, Apollo kills Python with one of his powerful a r rows (reminiscent of “ coronal mass ejection ” and intensely - powerful, radioa c tive solar wind). After patting himself on the back and setting a crown of laurel le aves upon his own head, Apollon establishes his sanctuary in the valley of Phokis (cognate focus) at the center of Greece on the southern slopes of Mt. Parnassus, at the or a cle of Pytho which was renamed Delphi (delphis, dolphin) in honor of this powerful God ’ s first mammalian inca r nation. It was at this shrine, the presiding oracle Pythia whose predecessors had similarly conjured visions and dreams of the past, present and future (since remote antiquity, a c cording to some they would speak in tongues) willi ngly devoted her talent to the excee d ingly - powerful, youthful and radiant God. Apollo ’ s attributions match up well with his classic mythology, his radiant strength in Leo, his youthful joy, & his children of the fifth house. Apollo ’ s victory over Python wa s celebrated every eighth year during the Delphic festivals of Stepterion. Notably, there were many other oracles such as those operating in Delos, Ten e- dos and elsewhere, and not only in Greece but all over the world. But the most important or a- cle in the w orld would become the Oracle at Delphi. Because Apollon had slain Python, Pythia became personal or a cle. Thus it was that Apollon acquired the world ’ s most famous oracle and place of sanctuary, along with the Delphic Tripod of Plataia (Constantine the 1st would later remove the last of these Delphic tripods and take it to his “ Hippodrome ” in then Constanti n- ople). The tripod originally served as a chair for the presiding or a cle. Its saddle was a large golden bowl solidly affixed to three long elegant golden slats for its legs — though ancient depictions show three heavier vertical golden columns as the tripod ’ s supports, as depicted on the most ancient Greek coins and works of art — often shown topped with three golden rings or hoops called omphalos, which in the Greek means “ world ’ s navel ” or umbilical chord, the center of whose navel (Pluton at the center of Earth) is shown as a smooth white stone or pe b- ble. The white stone is said to represent the Earth ’ s divine energies which is centered as gra v- ity is cent ered about her sphere. The ring on the chair ’ s back served as back support or lumbar terminal, with two rings in front for the priestess to grip tightly with her hands, as the se c ond and third conductive terminals to amplify Pythias connection with the Ear th ’ s energy centers as if raising Kundulini through the seven major chakras ... root, sacral, solar, heart,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Min’s Compleat Tarot Manual 19 throat, brow, & crown. It seems the tripod enhanced the oracle ’ s psychic senses by “ connec t- ing ” her with Mother Earth. According to some, the famous Del phic oracle made utterances in divinely - inspired verses which only the temple priest could interpret, but the oracle ’ s proph e- cies were usually equivocal, or just too ambig u ous to be understood at the time, its meanings undiscernible until those events came to pass: then her prophecy could clearly be understood. Is it any wonder that Nostradamus ’ prophecies predictably frustrate gentile audiences until after the fact — confounding them all the more! Better to recognize that prophecy & fulfil l- ment share commo n roots. In order that Apollo could enjoy the brilliance of skies throughout the year, he would leave Delphi at the autumn - al equinox and travel to the land of the h y perboreans on the northern shores of the river Ocean, which flowed all around the Earth. At the vernal equ i nox, Apollo returned to Delphi where nightingales would sing in welcoming him back home. The Hype r- boreans enjoyed eternal lives before banishment, chastisement, pain, suffering and death came upon the world. Apollo is the vanquisher of al l darkness. Just as Artemis (see Lesson #I The Moon) launched arrows causing the death of females for whom the cause of death was undetermined, so her twin brother Apollo sent arrows which brought death upon males whence the cause of death was undetermined . Thus Apollo and Artemis work in tandem, astronomically balancing the masculine & feminine traits. Recall that Apollo and Artemis killed seven sons & seven daughters of Queen Niobe, since she ’ d co m- pared them with the Sun & Moon in Leto ’ s presence ... fatal mi scalculation! “ The Sun, that is Apollo, is Leader of the Muses, and inasmuch as He co m- pletes our life with good order, He produces in the world Aesculapius; for even before the world was He had the latter by his side. ” — Emp. Julian ‘ Upon the Sovereign Sun ’ Aesculapius (Asklepios), god of medicine, was the mortal son of Apollo by Coronis, hence Homer refers to Apollo ’ s son in the human sense as a “ skillful physician ” who was so skillful at healing that he could even raise the dead. This made Hades feel threat ened, and so he co m- plained to Zeus, who in turn struck Asklepios down with a lightning bolt — on a c count of his healing practices threa t ening to void Hades ’ underworld, by raising all men from the dead. We can view this in the temporal sense as raising a d ead person back to life only to have them i n- exorably die all over again at some later date. However, to rise from the dead in the eternal sense insists that soul - body be made Christ - indivisible. This is healing on the hig h est order. To paraphrase the great historian Josephus, don ’ t be too su r prised that our human body is created to live forever."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Ten Heavens 20 Notably the skilled physician personified by Aesculapius had special talents in surgery and made use of medicinal plants, crystals, and all manner of homeopathic re medies remini s cent of the shaman or tribal witchdoctors, verily of the Mercurian souljourn (see Lesson #II The Magician). Among Aesculapius ’ children, are his two daughters named Hygeia (hygieinos, h y- giene, healthful) and also, Panacea (panakeia, cure - all for every illness, fix - all for every pro b- lem such as the mythical fountain of youth).

At 6,794 km equatorial diameter (0.5326 ER), Mars is over half the size of Earth. Mars appears red to the naked eye, and when viewed through a telescope the feared Red Planet r eveals his dark markings, his reddish, ferrug i nous, even pinkish colorings. Mars is covered by iron - rich dust with many basaltic(igneous) rocks — owing to the composition of its crust. White ic e- caps at the poles are composed mainly of frozen H2O (water) an d carbon dioxide (dry ice). These features respond to Mars ’ tropical seasonal changes which result from its ~25.19* rot a- tional obliquity to its helio - centric orbit (i.e., Mars ’ equatorial tilt to the Martian ecliptic i.e. some 1.8506 degrees inclined to t he Earth ’ s ecliptic). Thus for astrological charts on Mars, we ’ d use the Martian ecliptic (not Earth ’ s). Mars takes almost two tropical Earth - years (present long - term average 1.8808476) to complete one, 360* sidereal orbit; averaging 24.622962 earth - hours (1.02595675 solar earth - days) to complete one, 360* sidereal rotation. On the long - term ave r age, a solar day of Mars is equal to about 24 hours, 39 minutes & 35.2 seconds — or less than forty minutes longer than one solar day on Earth. This daily period va ries si g- nificantly, due to Mars ’ moderate orbital eccentricity of 0.09341233(FK5). There ’ s evidence that Mars was once a lot warmer, and had plenty of flowing liquid w a ter, indicative of climate and seasons similar to those of Earth — in view of the myriad s of dried - out river canals apparent on the Martian surface; e.g. the deep line of green named the Mar i- ner Rift Valley. It must ’ ve rained or snowed in the Martian mountains then ran down cutting channels and forming riverbeds. Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, at 17 miles (27 km, 90,000 ’ ) elevation and 320 miles(520 km) across! Most believe this “ missing ” water was frozen into the Martian permafrost although a planet - wide catastrophe would also account for this now - parched a t mo sphere. There are cratered spots on Mars believed to be extinct volcano vents. These craters fill up temporarily with dust during windstorms then empty out again after each tempest passes. (cf. anger which a l most instantly “ fills up ” then empties just as q uickly; cf. starry cup concerning soul ’ s descent into matter, ref. Macrobius, Bk. I. Ch. 12). These planet - wide dust storms can last several weeks and coincide with Mars ’ winter solstice in the northern hemisphere which in turn coincides with Martian peri helion (i.e., the nearest approach to the Sun). Mars exhibits somewhat “ Earth - like ” seasons, but more extreme with greater daily and se a sonal variation in pressure and temperature etc. than any other planet in the solar system — but it wasn ’ t always the ca se. Mars ’ thin atmosphere rises sixty miles above the surface, and is composed primarily of carbon dioxide (95.32%) with 2.7% nitrogen, 1.6% argon, 0.13% ox y gen, 0.03% water, and 0.00025% neon.

Mars has no ozone layer and has no oceans. Like its dried - up channels and riverbeds, whole ancient floodplains bear testimony to the abundance of water which used to sustain life on Mars. At present there is little or no protection from intense solar radiation, a l though Mars receives only about half the solar energy as what continuously bombards the Ea rth & Moon. At the Martian equator, the temperature ranges from 80 degrees Fahrenheit in broad daylight, then plunges rapidly to an arctic - like - 150 degrees F at night. Many astronomers have reported a controversial phenomenon called the blue haze also see n as a violet layer apparent in photographs taken with red and blue filters. Ratio n ale for this phenomenon abounds, but explanations are dubious. Mars ’ pronounced red color stands in contrast to its dark markings. Mars ’ two companion satellites, Phobos & D eimos, are so named for fear and terror, stifling and paraly z ing effects against our initiative by terror and dread. These twin fearmongers accompany Ares, the amb i- tious God of war, son of Zeus & Hera, brother of Aphrodite, Arge, Eileityia, Eris and Hebe. By Aphrodite, he was the f a ther to Anteros, Enyo, Deimos, Harmonia, Pallor and Phobos. Ares generally is less popular and less successful in his endeavors than other Olympian Gods. Athena personified nobler aspects of warfare, glory, honor and victory, whi le Ares personified more brutal aspects of warfare, and so was often depicted as wearing military armor. Ares is the “ bully ” of Gods, a brute inclined to commit vi o lence, shed blood and plunder. The dog and vulture are Ares ’ escutcheons, being first to bra ve the battlefields. Also, the wolf and the woodpecker are held sacred by Ares. To be an of f shoot of Mars refers to Ares ’ souljourners, heroes who demonstrate great valor and formidability via fighting against worthy adversaries. As the myth goes, Ares was caught in a “ love affair ” with Aphrodite. Her husband Hephae s- tus caught him then exposed him to ridicule, revealing that Ares had behaved di s honor - ably. In contrast, the Roman Mars is named after Ares who became honored above Jupiter as chief God of the conquest, and so The Tower is symbolic of an unconquerable co n quest."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Min’s Compleat Tarot Manual 23 #VI THE EMPEROR ________________________ Trump: THE EMPEROR Planet: Jupiter Roman: IOVIS/Deus Greek: Zeus Sphere: Charity Synodic: 399.9 Sidereal: 4332.2/11.86 Heaven: Sixth Arcana: VI Pitch: F > C Species: greater w/#4 Order: W - W - W - H - W - W (7) Mode: Lydian Muse: Euterpe Goddess: Melody ________________________ The tarot card of the Emperor symbolizes the sixth sidereal heaven of the “ king planet ” Jupite r, sphere of augmentation, enlargement, expansiveness, jov i ality, nobility, excellency, affluence, privilege, dignity, charitableness, universality, universalism, benevolence, exube r- ance, immunity, leadership, governance, farsightedness, travel far and abr oad, holistic, broadminded, compr e hensiveness, inclusiveness, “ eagle - eyed ” .

Jupiter has an int ense radiation belt in its magnetic field or ma g- net o sphere, a source of very powerful radio emissions. Jupiter is surrounded by no less than 28 natural satellites, including the well - known Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Galileo viewed Jupiter ’ s four b righ t est moons using a crude telescope hence these were dubbed the “ Galilean ” sate l lites. Speaking of which, quoting from an article dated 11/30/2001, surprising observations were made for Jupiter ’ s moon Europa: “‘ This extra thick layer of ice near the pol es wants to spin out toward the equator ’... But because the ice is locked into a global crust, it cannot simply spin out in all directions. Instead, the entire shell of the moon wanders.

Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun at a mean distan ce of 1,426,731,900 km or about 886,530,100 miles (9.53707032 AU J2000). Saturn measures 120,540km (74,900 miles) at its equator and has a mean sidereal day of 10 hours 39 minutes 22 seconds i.e. rotating 22,000 mph at the equator — nearly as fast as Jupit er ’ s sidereal day (see Lesson #VI Emperor). One sidereal orbit of Saturn takes about 29.44750 tropical Earth - years to co m plete (synodic year equals ~1.035 years). Although nearly 75,000 miles across at the equator, Saturn measures significantly less, about 67,500 miles, along the poles and so is the most oblate planet in our solar system.

Saturn ’ s appearance is similar to Jupiter but is fainter with soft yellow and gold atmospheric bands, thus ancient mythological associations of Saturn with gold. Saturn ’ s breathtaking system of rings turn edge - on as seen from Earth on average every 14.75 tropical Earth - years. As classical mythology recounts “ Saturn swallows his children ” when the rings are invisible. Hubble space telescope shows that these rings are never co m- pletely invisible but almost. Briefly, the rings are design ated by the letters A through G, with a couple of significant gaps in between. These are, in order of their discovery, rings ‘ A ’ 122,200km, B 92,200, C 73,200, D 67,000, E 230,000, F 140,600, & G 170,000; the significant gaps are named the Cassini Division at 119,000, and Keeler (Encke) Gap at 133,500. Each ring & gap has its own orbital period ranging from 4.9 hours for the ‘ D ’ ring, to 31.3 for ring ‘ E ’ . Of these major ring divisions, rings A, B & C are wide, and plainly visible through a telescope. The o ther ring d i- visions are much fainter and difficult to see. Each ring is subdivided into 1000s of “ ringlets ” that are, for the greatest part, only two to three dozen meters thick and are made of ice crystals and assorted impurities. When Galileo first viewe d Saturn ’ s rings, they were nearly at maximum angle to Earth. At other times the rings seemed to disappear prompting Galileo to ask Has Saturn swallowed his children? ... in reference to Saturn ’ s ancient mythology. The most common photographs of Saturn are tak en with rings at their greatest angularity to the Earth. However, due to Saturn ’ s orbital eccentricity (0.054151 J2000), the Sun is seen to illuminate Saturn ’ s northern hemisphere for nearly 15.75 tropical Earth - years whereas the southern hemisphere sees l ess than 13.75 years of sunlight, so these intervals average 14.75 years. Notably, Nostradamus referred to this maximum angle of the rings as “ Saturne fenera ” , translated verbatim “ Saturn turned and Sun - dried ” . That ’ s interesting, since Gal i leo was born ba rely two years before Nostradamus died in the summer of 1566. Understand? A little over half of the ring - disappearing acts are described as osci l lating triple passages by astronomers, lasting 8.5 to 9 months as Saturn crosses back and forth, south - north - so uth and north - south - north, as viewed along the plane of Earth ’ s ecliptic.

Taurus is the advocate for temporal living, passionate for life in the body. Taurus opposes death of the self, opposing the sting of death. Taurus, the conste l lation, begins near Gorgona Tertia (rhPer J2000 00Tau07 ’ 15.522 ” +20:34 ’ 34 ” ) and Algol (bePer 01Tau22 ’ 40.423 ” +22:25 ’ 48 ” ), centered on Aldebaran (alTau 15Tau00 ’ 00.000 ” - 5:28 ’ 03 ” ), notably ending on the Great Pyramid star Alnitak (zeOri 29Tau53 ’ 35.804 ” - 25:17 ’ 38 ” ) and Alhecka (zeTau mag 3.00 29Tau59 ’ 45.675 ” - 2:11 ’ 45 ” ). The Great Alnitak Pyramid, which was built nearly 12,500 tropical years ago, is the long - since withering altar in the midst of Egypt, & where the oracle took commencement; hence the ankh adorns the empty tomb, just as the empty vault in the king ’ s chamber symbolizes his life - eternal (Edgar Cayce talks about this via the psychic readings). Hence Taurus is the universal symbol for temporal living, temporal exper i ence in the body, our temporal life which ends in death of the body — the wages of sin. Understand? As the bright morning star, Venus was known to the Greeks as Phosphoros, Latins as Lucifer, Lucif i- cus, light - bearer, son of morning who “ dies ” as he is overpowered by the Sun. On average some 220 days past superior conjuncti on, Venus reaches maximum elong a tion from the Sun, leaving about 72 days until the next inferior conjunction (292 days total). V e- nus retrogrades on average for about 42 days, centered on inferior conjunction. Note 157 mean - synodic periods of Venus equals ~ 251 tropical years, as 1871 sidereal years of Venus equals ~720 mean - synodic years of Venus — which equals about 1151 tropical Earth - years. These are well - known e x amples of synodic multiples, such as Venus ’ almost exactly 8 tropical Earth - year multiple at maximum synodic elongation (next on June 8, 2004, again 8 years later, on June 6, 2012, etc.). Most synodic multiples of the planets are very predictable, recurring over long periods of time with subtle variations due to the dynamics of their orbits, which variations are also pr e- dictable. The ancients were adept at making these long - term predictions based on the synodic multiples, just as Nostradamus did to predict superior & inferior conjoins for his quatrins, as his epistle toward Henry II of France. In a pproaching her superior conjunction with the Sun, Venus is “ lost ” under the satur a tion of sunlight, remaining hidden from view for an interval that lasts about ninety earth - days, with superior conjunction occurring near the 45th day of the interval. Venus orbits the Sun about 1.626 times faster than the Earth does (note here that the Sun appears to orbit Earth hence the relative sidereal orbital period of the Sun equals exactly one sid e real year of the Earth). Venus and Earth both have relatively low orbita l eccentricities i.e. near - circular sider - eal orbits, Venus about 0.0068 (J2000), & Earth 0.0167."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Min’s Compleat Tarot Manual 35 Venus emerges as the bright evening star (i.e. visible after sunset) approximately 45 days after her superior conjunction (to the Sun; see Lesson #7 Justice). Venus continues to move closer to Earth until about the time of inferior conjun c tion (Sun - Venus - Earth syzygy), very near to her closest approach to Earth. Starting about 4 days before inferior conjunction, Venus disappears from view as she is o b scured onc e again by the sunlight where she remains hidden for about 8 earth - days (cf. 90 earth - days, centered on Venus ’ superior conjunction). Near inferior conjunction Venus approaches within 25 million miles of Earth, then about 4 days after inferior conjunction, Venus emerges at heliacal rising — just barely vis i ble before sunrise, becoming progressively more prominent as the bright morning star as her rising o c- curs earlier and earlier before sunrise — as V e nus recedes from Earth. This period is malefic for souls incarnated from Venus, as this inferior separation, most brightly portrayed by the planet Venus, exemplifies our second death, that “ cut - off ” point of soul from its heavenly sou l- journ and s i multaneous incarnation as a mortal being, or “ son of man ” in the ancient tongue (son in the neuter gender). Is it any wonder then, that Venus ’ day, that venerated sixth and last day of creation, is the day of humankind ’ s creating? This is true in the profoundest sense, as a planet needn ’ t be receding for a souljourn to o c- cur, but is in the active - tense of *separation*: the distancing of soul ’ s heavenly realm away from its earthly experience ... much reminiscent of a lost love as our recently dise m bodied souls were cast down to the Earth: “ How you are cut off from the heaven s, O Lucifer son ofmorning! You are cast down to the earth, making sinfulhumans vulnerable. ” — Isaiah 14:12, li t- eral translation The sacred letters are thus recounted as Lucifer & his angels fall into mortal living — vi r- tually identical to ancient Mayan myth s of Quetzalcoatl, for whom the Mayans reckoned a 584 - day cycle between superior conjunctions, or inferior conjunctions. The Mayans referred to soul ’ s incarnating as “ Quetzalcoatl ’ s descent to earth ” , with Venus ’ emergence as the mor n- ing star symbolizing h is (i.e. his/her) first arrival, Quetz ’ birth or incarnation as a sinful h u- man.

Helios] nu m bers fourth in orbit). The Sun shines perpetually upon the Earth which revolves sidereal - daily, while she orbits the Sun sidereal - yearly, resulting in her solar - daily rotation; i.e. with respect to the Sun. The slowly - precessing obliquity of the Earth on her axis of rotation to the Sun results in a tropical - yearly orbit which is Earth ’ s tropical year in the angle of sunlight irrespective of her daily rot a- tion i.e. only with r e spect to the gyrating axis of her daily rotations but without regar d to the periodi c ity of daily rotations. The Sun gives the greater light, and is the power - giving heart of our solar system. The Sun is by far the largest body herein. The Sun verily is the nearest star to Earth, averaging pr e cisely one astronomical unit ( AU) in radial distance (149,597,870.7km; 92,955,807.2 mi) in the short - term and slowly closing this di s tance over the long - term. The most radiant of the Gods is the central orchestrator who holds the divine i n struments of consciousness in the orbits to wh ich they formed and continue to evolve.

It is more likely that the Sphinx was quarried out during the prio r age of Leo which began approximately ~36,100 BC, or perhaps an even older age of Leo, beginning ~61,700 BC.

This should make it easier for you to recognize and remember the fif ty - six cards of the minor arcana, by associating them with the more familiar cards of hoyle — and no wonder since playing cards are known to be rooted in the minor arcana, thus associations are perfectly justified. You ’ ll surely recognize the first twelve cards of the minor arcana as the face cards: King, Queen & Jack each of the four suits Clubs, Hearts, Spades and Di a monds. That ’ s the easy part. The hard part is learning what these “ face ” cards mean in tarot, since they correspond with astrological houses of ones horoscope, meaning that predominantly ruling planets revealed in a tarot spread point to which houses are the most active, and which planets are the most effe c- tive or i n fluential for the reading. This aspect of the tarot pertains to daily living o r the more temporal influences of the pla n- ets to the Earth and to our body, the corporeal energies of the planets in the houses, act i vating channels or pathways in the horoscope. If it sounds to you like this is difficult to learn, you ’ re right. It depends on your mathematical and musical aptitude as much as anything else. And if you ’ re intuitive, that helps too, but intuition alone is not nearly as certain as the sy n ergy of mind, heart and soul. Some come by this naturally, while others have to work at it a bit. If I could give but one word of advice over all others, learn pattern reco g nition. Learn to recognize the limits of uncertainty. The order can not help but to emerge out of the chaos. It ’ s like “ finding ” familiar images in the clouds. Our co l lective unconscious “ helps ” us to see this empirically like a biofeedback mechanism of sorts. Some call it anthropomo r- phism, but basically it ’ s just you and it — and everything that that entails. How else can I e x- plain this? It just comes to you with practice. You look at the cards and see what they reveal. You can listen to the cards and hear their key signature “ singing ” in a dominant voice. Granted, that probably sounds crazy to the novice, but believe me with practice you ’ ll see the light. As with the major arca na, all of the cards in the minor arcana include a brief summary of important features or aspects thereof.

These cards are generally self - explanatory as stand - alone cards, but for this cha p ter we ’ l l concentrate on those divinatory meanings implied by the conjun c tions of sidereal planetary positions with cards that are drawn from the center pile, as described in chapter two. Anywhere cards of the major arcana appear, these d e note the conjunction of p lanets or caelestial ensigns as the case may be, while minor arcana cards denote the houses or planets in the houses mainly dete r mined by the position of the card or else the sidereal number thereof. For example, Mercury the “ Magician ” is sidereal number I I. Let ’ s say you were to draw the II of Pentacles and place it in the third position of the “ tree of life ” as shown in chapter 2, which is the root position of Mercury. This indicates a significant ruling Mercury in the sixth house of the horoscope, which house is represented by the Knight of Pentacles a.k.a. Jack of Diamonds. As shown in the previous chapter, the Knight of Pentacles card indicates the mut a- ble quality of the element Earth, the color Green, and the key of F, in Mercury ’ s theoretical Locrian modality as indicated on the trump card of the “ Magician ” .

As concert pitch this is commonly refe r enced to the A over middle C, given at 440 or 442 cycles per second. Students of sacred geometry have compared a few slightly d i f ferent tunings achieving remarkable results. J.S. Bach considered C# above middle C as our center pitch, while others find detuning their instruments slightly gives a deeper sound to the music. The center is rel a tive to hearing, and human hearing is cent ered on about middle C, give or take a few cents sharp or flat of pitch. More importantly, is the matter of steps & half - steps, white keys and black keys, the pri n- ciple of keyboard design forever centered on middle C, finding half - steps from E to F, and f rom B to C, all on white keys. Notice the pentatonic scales on all black keys, all of which is based on the mathematical principles of music & all of which is centered on the middle C. So you see, middle C is verily the ce n ter, and so Pluton is verily the center of the Stars and center of the Tarot, the ce n ter of the human ear, the center of Gaea. Next, let ’ s say you draw a VI of Cups and place it in the tree of life position of the Moon. VI is the sidereal number of Jupiter, and the Moon rules over the cou rt of King of Cups. Therefore Jupiter is exalted in the fourth house, that of Parents. As one more example, you draw the VIII of Swords, and place it in the position of Mars. As you ’ ll discover Mars doesn ’ t rule any of the houses listed on the VIII of Swor ds card, which are the houses of Marriage, Friends or Brothers, seventh, eleventh and third houses respe c tively. You ’ ll have to look at the rest of the tree for clues as to which house Uranus is conjunct Mars in. If Venus is the dom i- nant planet, then it is likely that Mars is fallen in the seventh house, since Venus rules over the seventh house. While a strong Mercury would more likely find Mars in the third house, but if no planet appears to be dominating the chart, then Uranus might rule in the eleventh h ouse over Mars therein. It ’ s easy once you get the hang of it. It is very similar to adjudicating an astrological horoscope, that is “ reading ” the horoscope for the most telling scenario, as dete r- mined by the planet hierarchy. The strongest planets in a ch art are those that are ruling or fallen, benefic or malefic as the case may be. Determine these and you ’ ll get the ove r view of the houses and planetary rulerships in no time. It ’ ll start coming together for you. If you draw the King of Pentacles, and place it in the position of Pluto, this would mean Pluto is in the tenth house, in the service of Saturn, in the service of Society. See how easy that is? Also, if you were to draw the Queen of Cups and place it in the position of Saturn, then Saturn and Pluto would be in mutual reception which is good for both planets and their infl u- ence which is brought to bear in the eighth & tenth houses. Because there are more than twice as many cards in the minor arcana than the major a r- cana, it ’ s not uncommon to draw only minor arcana cards in a ten - card reading.

7 Solar System C ONSIDER THE NICHE filled by each planet in their sidereal orbits around the Sun and the Sun & Moon around the Earth. Relatively speaking the planets are orbi t ing Earth epicyclically much as the Moon orb its the Sun in similar fashion the obvious dif - ference being that the Sun is by far the dominant gravitational focus for the entire “ solar system ” . The pertinence here, is that man exists solely on the Earth, and has never stood on the Sun nor any other p lanet in the solar system apart from Earth: at least not for many long millennia they haven ’ t. We d e- duce that the planets orbit the Sun based on what we see from Earth and from data sent back to Earth from un - manned vehicles launched into space. His instr u ments are in space, but man is on Earth. It ’ s amazing how such easy observational concepts escape any comprehension or acknow l- edgment by the orthodox astronomers, who instead create a “ straw - man ” argument of geoce n- tricity vs heliocentricity, as if ancient astron o mers around the planet never understood this distinction! That ’ s merely absurd, as the explicit sidereal numbering of the planets and sidereal fifths - numbering for the days of the week by ancient astronomers proves that they knew full - well the diffe rence between heliocentric and geocentric planetary motion. Ancients had amassed libraries of knowledge beyond such basic concepts as these, most of which are lost to antiquity and what little remains does so in exiguous fragments. Most if not all of what ’ s written in this book is my feeble attempt to resu r rect some of these lost principles of astronomy & astrology — as I am able. By applying these ancient pri n ciples to the tarot, the pages thereof are “ resuscitated ” back to life, since the basis for all th is is as old as man him - self, even hundreds of millions of sidereal years since the evening and morning of his/her creating. Which brings us to the main point of this chapter, to draw your attention to the togethe r- ness of the planets, the Gods who congreg ate in the pantheion. In their diatonic sidereal modalities the planets were formed and have co n tinued to evolve for long aeons of time in space, providing the environment and sustenance for all forms of life herein. This is the foundation of the world by the elements of creation, and is the en a bling force of the psyche, the breath of life and its astrological processes upon which the tarot is d e- pendent for its meaning and interpretation. That is why we begin with the seven planets and their seven di a tonic modalities, the seven unique styles of heavenly consciousness each of whose uniqueness depends on all the other planets for its very existence. Each planet makes a unique modal signature because it does so among its peers, meaning all eighty - four key sign a- tures have an equally vital role in the symphony of the planets or what we call the “ music of the spheres ” since it combines the sidereal modes with synodic ensigns. You see it ’ s helioce n-"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Min’s Compleat Tarot Manual 61 tric AND geocentric, di a tonic AND chromatic, white keys AND black key s, Solaires AND Lunaires. As the cornerstone of life itself, the cycles of life and death, the radiant “ wheel ” of the eighty - four, these Solars & Lunars are the essential ingredients for maste r ing tarot. Take note how the planets works together, and the ca rds of the tarot layout work together to reveal their portent. Read every tarot spread in context, each card in position one by one then the gestalt which they mutually inspire, our Jovian “ overview ” . This brings a sense of completion to your reading of th e cards, a conclusion to every tarot session where the spirit of divination prevails over mind. Not supplanting thought, rather governing over it. In the next chapter, we ’ ll complete the tarot pak with its last four cards or pages of the elements. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" Chapte r 8 Trinity N OW WE ’ VE REACHED the last four cards in tarot, the four “ Pages ” . The Page cards repr e sent the four elemental triplicities of the court cards in composite, where the creator, su s tainer and destroyer splay out from a single element, one divine t rinity or elemental triad as one force, thereby symbolized by the Page of each element. The four elements of creation are 1) Fire, the strong nuclear force; 2) Water or weak n u- clear force; 3) Air, electromagnetic force; 4) Earth, the force of gravit a tion. 1&2 micro, 3&4 macro. Together, the Pages quintessentially synergize the fifth element, called the kether or aether, the spirit “ fluttering ” upon the face of exi s tence. The four primordial elements extend to no less than ten dimensions or planes of co n- scio usness to which the planets co - formed in their orbits from the begi n ning. The spirit is ever - present in all dimensions, as spirit is slightly above the creation just as will is slightly above it. Each of the four page cards point to its triad of tones, col ors, houses, etc and their ruling planets. Understanding the elemental trinities is tantamount to u n derstanding Sepher Yetzirah, as I ’ ve previously mentioned back in chapter 2. For example, I suggest that you play the triad as it appears on each Page card begi n ning with the Page of Wands, whose tones are C, E and G#; consider also its co l ors, Red, Yellow and Blue - Indigo; its fiery houses of Ego, Sons & Spirit; its rulers Mars - receding, Sun, Jupiter - closing; refer also to chapter 5, the three court cards Ki ng of Wands, Queen of Wands, Knight of Wands, who together form the trinity of Page of Wands. This is the actual basis of the divine trinity, Father, Son, Spirit; King, Queen, Knight. This is the basis for all ancient wisdom, the triad of Life (death), Dea th (life), and the Resu r rect ion forever in the balance thereof ... eternally. We may read the Page card in a tarot layout in the same way, by considering first the el e- ment it represents, its elemental triplicity. Let ’ s say you draw the Page of Swords, pla c ing it in the position of Saturn. Therefore the eleventh house is actively ruled by Saturn - receding and his father Uranus, in the astrological element of Air, and which is the Ele c tromagnetic force of Consciousness: whose King is Venus - superior. Quetzalcoatl - t he - lesser is lost behind the Sun to become the greater or immortal Quetzalcoatl, who is the force of Venus closing to the Earth (cf major arcana trump of “ Justice ” chapter 4), and means Venus is ruling in the se v enth house. The Page of Swords under Saturn also points to Mercury - inferior, ruling in the third house of Brothers. Play the triad D, F#, & A#. It ’ s the same interval as other Pages, but each is in a different key a wholestep up from the previous. Try playing the second then third inve r- sion of the s ame notes F#, A# and D, then A#, D and F#. The first, second and third inve r- sions of each triad help you to recognize its triune essence, and all four Pages cover the complete spectrum of twelve chr o matic tones in Earth ’ s houses of her synodic zodiac - meani ng numbered by planets accor d ing to their synodic phases to the Earth."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Min’s Compleat Tarot Manual 63 Below are the four Pages in the tarot pak, and are the last cards listed in this book.
