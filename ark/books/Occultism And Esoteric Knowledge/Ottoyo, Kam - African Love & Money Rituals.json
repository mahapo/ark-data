The old chief (that is, traditional ruler) of the village has just emerged from the old but large, thatched, mud building that serves as his palace. He pauses briefly at the door in reflection, and then slowly returns into the inner room. There, he dons his big, heavy and beautifully-decorated ceremonial cloth and smiles to himself. He has reason to be happy, for in about an hour's time the durbar will begin, the durbar he has organized for the \"big\" government official who, shortly, will declare open the small post office which has been built with government financial assistance plus local labor help. He walks slowly into the large courtyard, where his senior linguist and two young attendants await him. Together, they leave the palace to walk the short distance to the durbar grounds, where virtually all the villagers are assembled. They pause midway on the short trip and simultaneously turn their eyes to look at the tropical sky, which has almost suddenly become overcast by black, rain-carrying clouds. The old chief whispers into the ears of his linguist, who in turn issues a command to one of the young attendants. As the latter trots off to run the errand, the small group turns to walk back toward the palace. Meanwhile, at the durbar grounds the villagers have begun to cast nervous glances at the sky and to fidget with"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"their clothes and stools. Soon the attendant joins the chief and his group at the palace, but this time followed by an old, emaciated and half clad man tightly clutching a small, animal-skin bag to his chest and leaning on a walking stick. After consulting with the chief, the newcomer movies to the middle of the courtyard, removes two tiny sticks from his bag and crosses them on the floor, this time watched not only by the chief and his group but by several other attendants and some of the chief's numerous wives. The old man removes some of the leaves from his bag and places them on the crossed sticks, adds a whitish powder, and sets a match to the sticks, herbs and powder. He gazes briefly at the flame, mutters an incantation, and proceeds to dance slowly around the fire intermittently, and this time, heavy drops of rain have begun to fall intermittently, and the villagers gathered at the durbar grounds start getting ready to leave. Meanwhile, the old man continues his dance round the fire, occasionally throwing his head toward the skies and muttering some words. About five minutes after he commenced his dance, the rain drops cease altogether; in twenty minutes the rain clouds completely clear away and the sky becomes clear again. Soon, the sun shows its pleasant face again, as the villagers slowly return to the durbar grounds. The chief gives the old man three kola nuts (payment for his services),shakes his bony hand, and with his group proceeds to the durbar grounds where villagers have gathered again. At the specified time, the \"big\" government official declares the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"post office open, and there is subsequent jubilation and entertainment for the rest of the day and well into the night. What has the funny dance of an old, illiterate, half-naked man around a small fire got to do with the stoppage of imminent rainfall? Sheer coincidence? Well, it IS magic! Real magick!! A couple of months later, a group of young men, with the secret encouragement of an ambitious sub-chief, meets at the village marketplace to address the mostly female traders and gather support for their contention that the chief should be destooled on account of his age. Through his seer, however, the chief has been warned of this and future meetings of the dissidents, and the \"rain man\" goes to work again. No sooner had the young men begun to address the market woman than sudden rain compels them to abandon the exercise and run for shelter. It rains all day (and it isn't even the rainy season yet!) They decide on another \"market day\" but again that too is rained off. Again and again, and yet again, heavy rainfall prevents them from making their inflammatory speeches, until the market woman, having got wise to what was happening, forcibly prohibit the young men from entering the market place again. Next market-day, no young men, no rainfall-and buying and selling continues as usual. MAGICK WORKS! "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Traditional African magickal practices are of various categories and could variously be described as sorcery, witchcraft, animism or, more accurately, a combination of these. Chapter two tdjfodf!boe!nbhjdl! ! A basic difference between African (and other Third World) magickal practices is that the former tends to use items obtained from the person or persons involved in the magickal ritual; thus, one finds that items like a person's hair (from the head and/or private parts particularly),finger-nail filings or cuttings, urine, blood, old clothes, etc, can easily be used to compel the individual concerned to obey the magician's instructions. Western magickal rituals, on the other hand, mainly entail calling on cosmic beings for assistance. Both work. Magick works all the time for those who know how to use its secrets. Over the years, magick has been used for all kinds of purposes- to acquire wealth, to kill or maim others, to run a person crazy, to compel anyone to love you, to compel an unwanted lover or partner (spouse) to leave you alone - and a host of other things (both evil and good). For example, did you know that with only a small amount of your"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"hair, any evil magician who knows his job can within 7 days cause you to die? You don't believe that? If you don't, well, all I can say is that you know very, very little about the tremendous forces that rule this world. In most parts of Africa , most people who are of any social or financial consequence would not have a haircut in a public place: for they know very well the untold harm that could be done to them if an enemy lay hands on even a single strand of their hair. Science has undoubtedly brought humankind several benefits, from the color TV to the micro-computer and beyond, but science has been unable to penetrate the remarkable arena of magic. So many things go on in this world that defy scientific explanation. In scientific circles, the fashionable thing is to condemn anything associated with supernatural as \"absolute nonsense\", \"primitive\" and/or \"ridiculous\". But as the Wise Ones all over the world know, magick works, has worked unfailingly for centuries in the past, and WILL continue to work for as long as the sun and moon shine on this planet! In the following pages, you will be shown how to use certain easy- to-obtain items or ingredients to make certain magickal preparations that enable you to assuredly obtain your love and money requirements or needs. No, no you will NOT be shown how you can use these items to KILL, maim or otherwise DESTROY that person or persons you so much love to HATE. Of course, you could, if you knew how, cause your enemy to suddenly throw himself in front of a passing car, jump through his office window to his death or simply go crazy. And you could do that from the privacy of your own home! However, if we want to use magick we want to use it for good,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"don't we? Thus, we shall use it to acquire and retain love and wealth. Chapter 3 BGSJDBO!MPWF!BOE!NPOFZ!NBHJDL! ! Magick has been successfully practiced in the “Dark Continent” (Africa) for a long time and continues to be practiced diligently by people of all levels of African society. Witchcraft is rife (although, sadly, it is mostly used in Africa for evil), and the worship of various gods and goddesses is rampant, as are several animistic or paganistic practices. However, it is often used for good also. If you are a medical person then you possibly have heard of the common, traditional method used by African witchdoctors to heal or mend human bone fractures? The witchdoctor catches a rooster, recites an incantation and breaks its leg (if the human patient has a broken left leg for example, the witchdoctor breaks the roosters left leg), applies some herbs to the broken parts, and ties the leg together with two flat sticks and a string after muttering some incantations over it. You know what happens? As the rooster’s leg heals, as it invariably does after a few days, the human patient’s leg commences to heal, too. Impossible? Well, I have seen it happen time and time again, and it has actually saved the legs of several people who, after being told by medical staff at hospitals that the only solution was to amputate their legs, have found salvation from witch doctors. There are a number of shrines in secluded parts of the thick tropical forests and to these troop all kinds of people-doctors, government ministers, businessmen, barren woman seeking to be"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"fertile, important men, woman seeking love magic formulae to control their husbands, job-seekers, the second-in-command seeking the death of his boss so he can take over the top job, etc. The educated and highly-placed individuals come and leave these shrines under the cover of darkness; the advent of Christianity has led to a situation whereby many people are “Christians” in name only, and they would swear to you that they knew nothing about magic, but they know that magic works, and thus they continue to utilize its powers to win desired jobs, eliminate enemies and competition, win and hold the love of anyone they desire, acquire wealth, and so on. I KNOW, because for several years I have used, and assisted others to use these self same powers to great advantage. YOU can also use these self-same powers to attain your love and money desires. For several years, ever since I was a child, I lives with my grandmother, who, until her demise, was a well known magician and medicine-woman, and who operated from her shrine deep in the forest. Her magical powers were well-known and night-after- night, day after day, ever since I could read and write, I would sit down with her, listening to and recording (as her unpaid “secretary”) the complaints of clients and the antidotes given them, helping to pick herbs endowed with magical properties, and so on. One day she called me into the inner chamber of the shrine and before the clay figure of the Goddess, warned me not to make noise or cry out, and then pricked the middle finger of my left hand with a needle. She squeezed three drops of blood from my finger"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"into a plate, mixed it with some herbs and powders and into a paste. She the marked my forehead in three places with some of the paste, muttered some incantations, and then made seven marks on the forehead of the clay figure of the Goddess, and proceeded to dance in a trance-like fashion. She stopped suddenly, gave a low whistle, and an amazing thing happened: a large, snake like animal crawled slowly from somewhere behind the clay figure, moved toward the plate containing the remnants of the paste, licked it clean, and vanished behind the figure once more. I was eleven old then, and was too scared to shout or cry out. In subsequent months and years, she gave me much more detailed information on what ingredients to use for what magical purpose, what spell to use and when, and gradually I built up power and knowledge. Condensed in this book are some of the most potent magical preparations I learnt from my grandmother and from a few pagan and “spiritualist” shrines. They ALL work for any person who uses them according to the instructions. Not only have I personally used them, but I have seen and assisted other people use these magical formulae to achieve love and money wishes. They are here for YOUR benefit, so use them! Chapter 4 Uif!hsfbu!qpufodz!pg!usbejujpobm!"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Bgsjdbo!nbhjd! ! The great potency of traditional African magical rituals stem principally from the fact that the practioner uses items connected with themselves and/or the target persons of their magical rituals. Voodooism, which developed from the African magical system, uses similar methods. Among the items commonly used in traditional African magical rituals are the following: 1. Hair clippings - from the head and/or underarms, private parts and beard. 2. Fingernail or toenail clippings, cuttings or fillings. 3. Items of clothing previously worn by the target person; clothes worn to the skin are of particular significance. 4. Flows from the human body. These are of three main types, urine, menstrual flow and semen. These items, when used in addition to certain other ingredients in the right magical way, provide a most powerful link between the magickal practioner and the target human being (s) so that the former can command and control the latter at will - for good or for evil. We are in these pages, concerned only with good, however. Your name, your fingernails and toenails, your semen, your menstrual flow - all these contain power, and in essence they are YOU! Any single one of them can, under the right magical conditions and with the right ingredients, be used to kill or harm you in any way desired or to COMPEL you to do anything the user requires of you.

And you can easily attract wealth and prosperity toward you by using the very simple magical preparations disclosed here. Using them, and sooner than you think possible, you will be gloating over your good fortune. Part 2 Chapter Five USBEJUJPOBM!BGSJDBO!MPWF!NBHJDL! ! Africa is largely a polygamous society, and a common measure of a man’s social success is the number of wives he has; consequently as a man becomes richer he usually marries more woman to reflect his improved financial status. As you can imagine, the presence of two or more woman competing for the love, attention and money of one man inevitably brings about a lot of envy , jealously and bitterness among the competing woman. Consequently, witchcraft and other forms of magic are extensively used to effectively capture the love and attention of the men involved and to oust rivals from the marital home. Thus, one commonly finds a man with, say , three wives but who pays"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"virtually no attention at all to two of them whilst being completely besotted with the last one who usually is not even the prettiest of the three nor the best cook! What commonly happens is the husband is magically compelled to either divorce the other woman or to mistreat them so much that they leave the matrimonial home or the marriage on their own volition. The men have been able to, with the aid of the magical preparations described below, win the hearts of the ladies they desire and to control them completely. Is there someone out there that you love and desire with your whole being but are unable to have them either because you are too shy, too ugly and/or too poor? Well, you can have them. Yes, you can compel them to notice you, to love you, and to have love and sexual interest in you alone. And you command the person from the privacy and comfort of your own room or house! These magical preparations can be used both by men and by woman. Believe it or not, the majority of the unending daily competition among men and/or woman for the love and affections of members of the opposite sex is won in the privacy of rooms: with magick ,that is! Have you ever wondered how that unattractive woman ever won the heart of, and married, that dashing, rich man you had always fancied? How come he passed over all those beauties (probably including you) and settled for that plain lass? Or haven’t you often wondered how on earth that man ever won the heart of that woman who is so obviously his social, financial and mental superior? Well, the fact is a few people in this world do know what"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"they want, and after identifying what or who they want they go out and get them - magically! You are about to join these go-getters. The influence of good looks, money ,fine manners, good clothes, and so on, pale into insignificance compared with the powers of magic in winning or retaining love. The love magic detailed out below will enable you to: 1. Compel any man or woman to love you. 2. Compel an existing lover or partner to love you, Stick to you and never to leave you. 3. Compel a lover or partner who has left you to come back to you. 4. Break up the love affair between a person who ‘stole’ your lover or spouse from you and the ex-lover/spouse. 5. Kill the sexual interest your lover or spouse may Have for any other person but you. 6. Control your lover or partner so that he/she obeys your Commands - to put him or her right under your thumb! Haven’t you often wondered why an otherwise aggressive, intelligent and “sensible” man could be so controlled by his wife, so much so that he becomes meek and mellow in her presence? Well, don’t you know any man or woman who thus ‘inexplicably’ succumbs to a partner’s bullying? Magick WORKS for those who know how to use it. Finally, have you ever wondered, after a long, Intense, love-affair or marriage has ended, how on earth you could have loved, and continued to love, that man or woman all that time? How could"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"that have happened to YOU: practical, ’sensible’ you? What could you have seen in him/her in the first place anyway, you wonder.

You will soon be shown how you too can “bottle up” any man or woman and thus compel them to obey your love and other commands without fail, and for as long as you wish! Chapter six IPX!UP!NBHJDLBMM!XJO!OFX!MPWF! Underneath the shade of a tall mango tree, two young men sit chatting away on a bench on a hot Sunday afternoon in a small, African town. Suddenly, one of them stops in mid-sentence and looks fixedly into the distance; his companion follows his gaze. Coming along the dusty footpath which passes close to where they sit is a tall, very beautiful girl apparently in here late teens. Even at a distance it is obvious that she is a beauty, her plaited hair adorned with shiny beads. “There she comes!”, says the first man. “Who?” asks his partner absent mindedly. “Oh. The girl I told you about two days ago. She is a beauty, isn’t she? But she’s so arrogant and rude! I have tried chatting her up on several occasions but each time she stares at me as if I have two heads and simply walks away without uttering a word. What does she think she is, anyway?”, the first man adds hotly. “Ha, ha, haa, so you are in love!”, says the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"second man as he bursts out laughing. Well, it’s not funny. That girl is so rude. You’ll see that she’ll pass without even a simple greeting to us”, says the first man. (In many parts of Africa it is considered most rude to walk pass seated persons without saying ‘hello’). The girl approaches along the path, and walks straight past where the men sit, only about one yard from the path, without uttering greetings. “There I told you!” says the first man heatedly as the girl turns the corner. “Well, let’s teach her a lesson”, says the second man as he gets up and pulls his companion toward the path. “What are you staring at?”, the first man enquires as his partner examines the footprints the girl has left in the dust. “This is her footprint”, says the second man. “Pick-up some of the dust from here with your left hand”, the second man reiterates as he points at a footprint. His partner collects the dust as directed and wraps it in a piece of paper. As they walk home, the second man tells his now very surprised friend what to do with the dust. So as to compulsorily"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"win that girls love. Two days later, the first man meets the girl and mutters a greeting, stealing himself for her usual rebuff. But to his amazement, she stops, smiles and returns the greeting; for the next hour or so they stand chatting away. They arrange a meeting for the next day, and in a few weeks they had become deeply attached to each other and get married a few months subsequently. Coincidence or magic? Well, it is magic, and I should know for I am the “second man” described above: for yet another time, I had shown another human being how he or she can use a simple item as dust from the left footprint of the person whose love is desired to compel the love one to obey love commands. Cfmpx!jt!uif!tjnqmf!mpwf!sjuvbm/! If there is any person (man or woman) you love, fancy, desire sexually, are attracted to (call it what you will) but for one reason or another you are unable to make any headway in your efforts, do the following: 1. Go to the place where you are likely to see this person whose love and affection you so very much desire. 2. Follow him/her at a discreet distance without arousing suspicion. Walk with them, if you are already acquainted. 3. Collect a little dust from a place your are sure the person’s left Foot (whether naked or clad in a shoe) has stepped; wrap this Dust or sand up in a piece of paper or handkerchief. 4. Anytime that night, sit alone in a room, with the dust spread in a"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Paper and placed in front of you on the table. Have a light on. 5. With a pin or needle, prick any part of the middle finger of your left hand and allow 1 or 3 drops of your blood to fall on the dust. 6. Look at the mixture (dust and blood) and slowly repeat the following spell 3 times: “You who dwell in my mind, you who trod on this sand/dust, with My blood I begin and seal a bond of love between you and I; and you are powerless, powerless are you, to break this bond”. 7.Wrap up the mixture and, using a black thread, tie or sew it up In a small, neat cloth or in thick paper. 8. Carry this on your person when going to where you expect to See the person in question. Either of two things WILL Happen: (I) either the target person will make the first move by starting a conversation, introducing themselves or any other such thing calculated to attract your attention (they won’t know Why they are doing that but they will), OR (II) if you are courageous enough to make the first move, the Target person will feel compelled to accede to your Suggestions for a date, etc. 9. In either case, the person concerned will be most susceptible to your amorous advances and you must not hold back. Keep The item secretly on your person each time you to are Meeting, until you become inseparable. 10. After you have won the person’s heart, keep the item Somewhere in your bedroom - unknown to the person. 11. If sometime in the future you desire to break the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"relationship, sit at a table as described above on the night of any day.

This equally powerful love magical ritual involves the use of the person’s names and an egg. Your name is a powerful part of you, and a person who knows how can use your names to compel you to obey their wishes. Here are the details: 1. Get yourself one chicken egg; any ordinary egg will be okay but it is more powerful in this case to use the egg of a white hen. A friendly poultry farmer can easily get you one. 2. Using a piece of charcoal or black felt pen, write the names of the target person (whose love you seek) 9 times in different directions all over the egg. 3. Carry the egg into your garden or into the field or woods, dig up the earth/ground and put the egg into the hole. 4.Before you cover up the hole, repeat the person’s name 9 times"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"and then say (once), “As the hen loves her egg so do I command you to love me”. 5. Cover the hole with earth and go home. Obviously, if the object of your love is a total stranger whose name you don’t know, you will have to discreetly ask around for his or her name. 6. As soon as possible, place yourself in a situation where you and the other person will meet. The person will surprisingly show (romantic) interest in you and you must respond accordingly. 7. If you wish to hold or retain that person, then repeat the ritual once every 6 months. However, if you seek only a short affair, do nothing for when the egg rots completely the lover will leave on his or her accord. Uif!spptufs 5 t dspx!sjuvbm! ! This is a very powerful but simple love magic ritual that involves a live rooster (cock).

Stand at the junction of the two forks (that is, where the two arms of the fork meet) facing the fork. Wet the hankie with all the cold water from the small bottle. 4. Gaze at the wet handkerchief and mention the name of the person 9 times, then say, “The road/path (choose whichever applies) leads left, the road/path leads right. The road/path comes from behind I call on the spirit of (mention the name of the person) to obey my command. Come to me and (here state your love commands regarding the person)”. Repeat until you have said it 3 times in all. 5. Then clean your face with the wet handkerchief and go home, allowing the water to dry on your face. 6. Do not wash or clean your face again that day until after you have seen or met that person. The latter will take a keen amorous interest in you in response to the commands you gave to his/her spirit at the fork in the road or path. The following ritual is powerful and very simple to perform, but like the proceeding one you need to know the name of the person whose love you desire. Proceed as follows: 1. At 9am or 9pm on any Friday when the moon is waxing (that is, moving from new to the full moon), take a tablespoon of granulated sugar from a new packet of sugar and put it in your right palm. 2. Slowly pour the sugar in your palm onto a clean, dry saucer, saying (once only) as you do so, “sugar, sugar, you sweetner of all"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"things, sweeten the mind and heart of (state name) towards me”. 3. Wash and dry your hand thoroughly. Then empty a tablespoon of salt (taken from a new packet of salt) into your right palm and pour into the same saucer, this time saying (once only). “salt, salt, you preserver of all things, bring me the love of (state name) from this day. 4. Mix the salt and sugar and carry the mixture into the kitchen. Turn the stove on, and when red-hot, take a pinch (with either hand) of the mixture and drop in onto the fire. Repeat this until you have dropped 9 pinches altogether into the fire. 5. Throw the remainder of the mixture away. In the following days, strive to be present where the person concerned can see you. 6. Repeat as often as required. It is much easier to compel a person to love you if you have frequent contact with, and easy access to, them and their belongings. In situations where the person is already quite familiar to you and you can gain access to their hair (collected from their combs), photographs, fingernails, etc, you can most easily make the person your love slave, compelling him or her to obey your every love command. Now, let us begin with food. Endeavour to invite the person over to your place for a meal you will prepare yourself. Then perform this magical ritual. Uif!gjohfs.objm!sjuvbm! ! 1.

Stir these browned fingernail filings into a stew, soup, gravy, etc, and give this to the person to eat. 4. You may partake of the food, and this will in no way affect the magical effect. 5. As you stir the fingernail filings into the food, say 3 times, “(name of person) with my fingers, I hold your love, with my fingers, I hold your heart”. 6. The person’s love and attention irresistibly begin to focus on you soon after consuming the food. 7. Note that this ritual can also be used to retain the love of an existing love, or spouse.

Chapter Fourteen Usbejujpobm!Bgsjdbo!npofz!nbhjd!boe! efwjm!xpstijq! ! Yes, some types of traditional Arican magic entail selling one’s soul to the devil for money. Let me hasten to assure you, however, that such methods are excluded from this book. Suffice to say that they DO exist and WORK, and there are individuals who have risen from absolute poverty to unbelievable wealth and prosperity in a span of a few months. U ntrue Well, I have seen it happen time and time again. However, the methods are horrific and sometime involve the use of certain parts of the human body (the heart, the sex organs, etc - and note that ritual murder is quite common in"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"many parts of the THIRD WORLD). Mysterious snakes which vomit vomit bank notes, wallets that can never go empty for the simple reason that any money you spend simply vanishes back into the wallet. All these types of evil money magic do exist and are used to this day. But the price to pay is almost always very high. Money magic involving the sale of your soul and the sacrifice of toher souls exists and is practiced to this day, but usually only the most stout-hearted persons seek out the money magicians fro such magic preparations. The magical rituals involved are varied, and a common type involves the following: 1. The wealth-seeker discreetly asks for information and guidance from knowledgable persons (usually those who have themselves used such magic) regarding where to locate the “money-maker”, and usually has to travel for long distances through the forest with the guide to the shrine concerned. 2. There, he is kept for between 3 and 7 days while he undergoes a series of tests to ascertain how determined he or she is to go through the money ritual. 3. Convinced of his or her determination, the money-making magician (usually an old man) revelas to the seeker whose soul or life is acceptable in payment fro the wealth. The choice is always between two people, the soul/life of the seeker himself or the soul life of the person dearest to him or her - a wife or husband, a parent, a child, a brother or sister. Certainly, your favorite enemy’s life cannot be accepted in payment. 4. The client returns home, and a few days alter returns as specified to the shrine with a few items belonging to himself or the person to be sacrificed - items such as photographs, a pice of used clothing, etc. 5. If it is the seeker himself whose life is required, he is told how long he will live to enjoy the wealth. The numbers of years he"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"would spend a (after the ritual) is often determined in a rather bizarre way: a rooster which had been starved for sometime without food or water is freed from under the basket and given several grains of maize. The number of grains it is bale to eat withing a specified time period constitutes the numbers of years the seeker would enjoy his or her wealth. You think the rooster eats up all the grains? Hardly! Usually it is so weakened by starvation that it eats only a few grains. 6. The money magical ritual is then performed and the client returns home, after being told what to do. If someone else had been sacrificed, the person dies suddenly - there are several regulations regarding such a death, such as that the money seeker must not weep at the funeral. 7. Soon after, wealth begins flooding to the seeker; he literally acquires the Midas Touch and every business venture (suggested at the ritual) he undertakes booms and he becomes very, very rich in a matter of months. However, if his own life was required, he would unfailingly die at the stipulated time and date. 8. Besides, if the seeker breaks any of the several tough rules governing the ritual, he could suddenly lose all his wealth, go crazy, etc, but would still die at the stipulated date. These horrendous magical activities DO occur and exist, and their horrific nature is evident in the numerous modern mansions built with such blood money and which remain unoccupied because they are haunted by the angry spirits/ghosts of spouses, children and other realtives sacrified for money. However, we are not interested in blood money,are we? I have only mentioned the foregoing in order to draw your attention to: 1.
