EXTRACTS FROM FIRST NOTICES. “Not everyone will care for Mr. Neuburg's tone in all the pieces, but he is undoubtedly a poet to be reckoned with, and a volume so original as this is should create no small stir. It is superbly produced by the publishers.” — Sussex Daily News . “When one comes to the poems . . . it is evident that they are written in English. . . . In a certain oblique and sub - sensible sense, eloquent and musical. . . .Distinctly Wagnerian in their effects. . . .” — Scotsman . “It is full of ‘the murmurous monotones of whispering lust,’ ‘the song of young desire,’ and that kind of poppycock.” — London Opinion . “A competent master of words and rhythms. . . . His esoteric st yle is unreasonably obscure from an intelligent plain poetry - lover's standpoint.” — Morning Leader . “A charming volume of poems . . . Pagan glamour . . . passion and vigour. . . . ‘Sigurd's Songs’ are commendable for dealing with the all too largely neglect ed Scandinavian Theology. . . . A scholarly disciple. . . . The entire volume is eminently recommendable.” — Jewish Chronicle. “A gorgeous rhapsody. . . . Fortunately, there are the police. . . . On the whole, we cannot help regretting that such splendid po wers of imagination and expression are flung away in such literary rioting.” — Light . “Sometimes of much beauty of rhythm and phrase. . . .” — Times . “Poets who have any originality deserve to be judged by their own standard. . . . A Neo - mystic or semi - astro logical pantheist. . . .” — Liverpool Echo . “Love - making appears to have an added halo in his eyes if it is associated with delirium or blood - shed. . . . Mr. Neuburg has a '’careless rapture’ all his own; the carelessness, indeed, is just the trouble. Hi s versification is remarkable, and there is something impressive in its mere fluency. . . . So luxurious, so rampant, a decadence quickly palls. . . . On the whole, this book must be pronounced a quite grievous exhibition of recklessness and folly.” — Manc hester Guardian . “. . .We began to be suspicious of him. . . . Hardly the sort of person we should care to meet on a dark night with a knobby stick in his hand. . . . This clever book.” — Academy . “A vivid imagination fostered by a keen and loving insight of nature, and this allied to a command of richly adorned language . . . have already assured for the author a prominent place amongst present - day poets. . . . An enthusiastic devotion to classic song . . . sustained metrical charm. From the first to last t he poet's work is an important contribution to the century's literature.” — Publishers' Circular . “This [book] contains the answer to a very well - known riddle propounded by the late Elizabeth Barrett Browning. You remember she asked in one of her poems, ‘Wh at was he doing to Great God Pan: Down in the reeds by the River?’ Well, Mr. Victor Neuburg has discovered the answer, for he was obviously wandering near the river if he was not hidden in the reeds. . . .” — R OBERT R OSS in The Bystander . “There is no quest ion about the poetic quality of much of Mr. Neuburg's verse. . . . We are given visions of love which open new amorous possibilities.” — Daily Chronicle .

Such as been the response to the appeal in our last number th at we have been able to put in hand the task of translating the Official In - structions of A ∴ A ∴ into French, and, if it continues, we shall be able to publish them in every important language of the world within the next two years. Your overworked Editor, t oo, have been able to take the longest and happiest holiday of his life. River and forest have given him all that nature can; and this was the least part of his contentment. Moreover, he has been able to prepare, under sublime guidance, a dozen Official Instructions of A ∴ A ∴ , to conclude the great Qabalistic Dictionary of Gematria, and to begin the almost equally important Greek Dic - tionary on similar lines. He has had leisure to produce more play, sketches, poems, and stories in this last year than he has done in any prev ious five years of his life. For all this his gratitude is due, and must be expressed, to the self - sacrificing devotion of our sworn sub - editor, Mr. Victor J. I. Neuburg. Rarely in all history has so unpleasing an exterior concealed such sterling qualities of heart and brain, such indomitable courage, such inflexibility of will, such loyalty and truth. We are glad to hear that he is about to accept a highly paid post on the staff of our bright little contemporary The Looking - Glass , and that he who himself s ings so musically may be in his turn the means of making others sing.

The North and the Mi dlands are already making London look to its laurels; the West has surpassed all hope; America, South Africa, Burma, India, the Malay Peninsula, West Africa, all thrive. Australia has received an important addition to its strength; we have excellent accoun ts from British Columbia, Paraguay, and Brazil. France is being specially nursed at present, but Holland, Switzerland, and Germany need no such aid. The work in Spain is still hampered by political conditions, and we are sorry to hear little from Italy. In Algeria and Egypt work has got somewhat into arrear, but we hope that the winter will see the fundamental task fairly accomplished. As we go to press, we are overjoyed to receive the most excellent accounts from the Caucasus, where the good work done b y Monsieur Nelidoff twenty years ago has come to marvellous fruition. With regard to personal progress of Probationers, nothing can be more satisfactory. The process of sifting, subtle but severe, initiated by V.V.V.V.V., and carried out so thoroughly by the Præmonstrator of A ∴ A ∴ , has been perfectly successful. Every day brings a report illustrative of the fact that people who do not do the practices, but gossip about the A ∴ A ∴ , find themselves mysteriously outside, without word spoken; and the correlative fact, that people wh o do the practices find that results do happen. It is most astonishing, even to us; under the old empirical, dogmatic methods people could work really hard for years, and get absolutely nothing; in our three years' experience with the A ∴ A ∴ , we have not fo und one man in whom three months' work has not produced at least one notable result.

This is the nature of the Work. 11. First, there are many and diverse c onditions of life upon this earth. In all of these is some seed of sorrow. Who can escape from sickness and from old age and from death? 12. We are come to save our fellows from these things. For there is a life intense with knowledge and extreme bliss which is untouched by any of them. 13. To this life we attain even here and now. The adepts, the servants of V.V.V.V.V., have attained thereunto. 14. It is impossible to tell you of the splendours to which they have attained. Little by little, as your eyes grow stronger , will we unveil to you the ineffable glory of the Path of the Adepts, and its nameless goal. 15. Even as a man ascending a steep mountain is lost to sight of his friends in the valley, so must the adept seem. They shall say: He is lost in the clouds. But he s hall rejoice in the sunlight above them, and come to the eternal snows. 16. Or as a scholar may learn some secret language of the ancients, his friends shall say: “Look! he pretends to read this book.

Many adepts throughout the ages have sought to do this; but their words have been perverted by their successors, and again and aga in the Veil has fallen upon the Holy of Holies. 19. To you who yet wander in the Court of the Profane we cannot reveal all; but you will easily understand that the religions of the world are but symbols and veils of the Absolute Truth. So also are the philosop hies. To the adepts, seeing all things from above, there seems nothing to choose between Buddha and Mohammed, between Atheism and Theism. 20. The many change and pass; the one remains. Even as wood and coal and iron burn up together in one great flame, if only that furnace be of transcendent heat; so in the alembic of this spiritual alchemy, if only the zelator blow sufficiently upon his furnace all the systems of earth are consumd in the One Knowledge. 21. Nevertheless, as a fire cannot be started with iron alone, in the beginning one system may be suited for one seeker, another for another. 22.

The student cannot hope for much success unless he have thoroughly mastered Asana , and obtained much definite succes s in the meditation - practices of Liber E and Liber HHH. On the other hand, any success in this practice is of an exceedingly high character, and the student is less liable to illusion and self - deception in this than in almost any other that We make known. [The meditation - practice in Liber E consisted in the restraint of the mind to a single predetermined imagined object exterior to the student, simple or complex, at rest or in motion: those of Liber HHH in causing the mind to pass through a predetermined series of states: the Raja - Yoga of the Hindus is mainly an extension of the methods of Liber E to interior objects: the Mahasatipatthana of the Buddhists is primarily an observation and analysis of bodily movements.

I WAITED for news that my heart beat. The severing night was between me and my love. There was no god of sleep; sleep were traitor. I sought to praise my love, and to lament the hours that divided us; and I could not. Therefore I wrote down the story of my life. And it is this: * * * * * Gilded and painted to hide its worm - eaten planks, my pleasure - boat was foundering. I cursed the treachery of the workmen, and resolved to trust myself to my own arms rather than to abide any longer therein. No sooner had I taken off my clothes and p lunged into the river than I perceived that it was now become dark. On the one hand glowed a star, curious indeed, but of no great brightness, and promising but little; while on the other was a sombre and fantastic lamp, whose fascination was its horro r. If I swam lazily towards either of these, it was because their light, confused and difficult on the one part, and tenebrous on the other, was yet light in comparison with that aimless and abiding gloom which had now settled upon the bosom of"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 56 the river. And these lamps were above the river, children of a nobler element. And in the river is the great Leviathan that devours men. But before I had come within the sphere of attraction of either of these, suddenly mine eyes were gladdened with a marvellous vision. Infinitely far off, as it seemed, a ray of sunlight shot through the Saturnine gloom of the skies, and lit the surface of the water. And then I perceived that upon the river there floated, within that small circle of light, an ark, or as it might be, a coffin. Then looking up into that pierced cloud I saw within the light a certain house surrounded by a grove. Within, all was dark; yet from it proceeded a ray as silvery as the first ray was golden. And I desired ardently to enter that house. Ye t, having no wings, the task appeared beyond my human force. Then the heavens closed as suddenly as they had opened, and I was left darkling. Yet I had this candle of hope, that within the ark, could I reach it, might be some help of knowledge or power w hereby that house might be attained. So I swam steadily toward, though with some fear, for the eddies in that great stream were numerous, and my sole guide was a slender snake of light that moved upon the water. Or so it appeared; for I have since disco vered that I had an interior sense of direction as trusty as the mariner's compass; so that, though I knew it not, it was never possible for me to go astray. Now as I swam I came upon one floundering and spluttering in the stream, who with mighty puffings urged me to continue."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE ELECTRIC SILENCE 57 For but a little way beyond us (quoth he) is a mighty swimmer and a dexterous. So with a mighty effort my comrade put forth all his strength, and we gained upon this one, and greeted him. Thereupon he (and he was a goodly man, and fai r) did most heartily welcome me as a fellow - traveller to that house, and confirmed me in my belief that the ark did indeed hold the secret of the way thereto. And as for the guide that might convey us through the darkness and the tumult of the stream, he spoke (something darkly) of one appointed, and more clearly that he was aware of divers marks upon the way; for, said he, to them that view it from above this trackless waste of water is mapped out and charted with a perfect science. Behold! quoth he. And at that moment was there a glimmer just before me of a white shining triangle, and what was most strange, rather an impression than a vision of a man that hung upon a gibbet by one heel. This, said the fair man, is a most notable sign that we travel the right road. Now by the light of the triangle I perceived another wonder; for my friend was not swimming as I was in the stream, but was borne by a boat, frail indeed, yet sufficient. Within this shallop or cockleshell he pulled me, and set me at the bench . Then (still by the light of the triangle) I saw a dark man at the thwart, rowing a strong stroke. We pulled on almost in silence; for when I asked of the fair man his name he answered me only “I wish to know,” and of the dark man “I wish it were light, ” the first clearly a confession of ignorance, the second a patent evasion; which things discomforted me much.

I cried out joyfully, “The bow of promise,” but they answered nothing. And at that I understood that they had trav elled further already, and were but returned for an hour to succour me who had no boat. Seven days then we remained in the tower, eating and drinking. Also in my sleep I had many marvellous dreams, of greater sustenance than sleep itself. And there was given unto me by my fair brother (for so I may now call him) a little book, wherein it was written how a man might build himself a shallop, and have for steersman one appointed thereunto. This then I laboured to build, and the toil was great. Moreover, ce rtain vile fish rose from the water, and with their fins beat upon the planks of my boat, that I might not end it. However, at last I had it perfect, and was about to set sail at dawn. But first the dark man my brother departed from us, and went his way . And then the old man of the tower took me aside and offered me a seat at the funeral feast of his master.

For the gentlest perfume was"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE ELECTRIC SILENCE 59 borne upon the breeze, and the air was lit with faint electric flames that gathered themselves into a hill of light. So I, being lifted up, and my heart overflowing, came into the funeral chamber that was exceeding bright, and there was the table for the feast, and beneath it the coffin wherein lay the body of the master. There too I saw barren wood bear roses, and I heard the voice of the master. After that I was shewn all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and many o ther things of great use and beauty. Then I took my leave of the old man of the tower, and boarded the shallop that I had made, when he cried out piteously that he feared earthquake, and asked me for my aid. So with a heart both heavy and light I abandoned my shallop and the dreadful labour of its fashioning, and came back to him. Then came earthquake as he had foreseen; and he and the boats also were swallowed up. In the tidal wave of the earthquake I was borne far away, even from the fair man my brother; and in the darkness he was lost to me. I knew not even whether he had perished. But fashioning a raft from the loose planks of the wreckage, I made shift to paddle. The ark was invisible, and I had no more memory thereof, so turned away was I and absorb ed in the bright signs upon the way. And now my raft was like to sink, and my arms were exceeding weary, when a voice sounded but a little above me: “Enter the ark!” And I looked up and beheld a bearded man, mighty, with the signs of labour and long journ eying writ upon him. I knew him; and for this reason was I much amazed, for I had believed him far from that place.

But he only answered me: “It is a pity!” And with that I returned to my task, and he guided me th erein with his counsel and example. Yet in the ark the gloom is fierce; the river without is but twilight, wherein shadows are free; within is darkness itself, and the essence and quintessence of darkness. In this terrific silence I abode for very long; t hen for an instant that seemed longer than many lives the sun of heaven broke in and smote mine eye, so that I fell backward nigh fainting. But he bade me be of good cheer and return to the task. I obeyed; and behold! again the sun, and behind the sun a glimpse of one appointed equally to be hidden and to be seen, each as may be fitting. But the brightness of the sun and its heat dazzled me and scorched me. My members refused to obey; and I slid backward into the great stream that was here so icy cold, a nd it refreshed me and comforted me. Now then I was minded to enter again the ark when there flew unto me, I wot not whence, a dove, and perched upon my shoulder. And thus I swam for a while, and the waters of the stream were soft and warm, caressing me. Yet I felt that this aimless drifting was enervating my limbs; so I gathered some stray planks of my raft — for they still floated round the ark — and began half playfully to paddle, with what purpose I cannot tell. And so it was ordered that the dove flew to me with an oak - leaf in its beak."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 62 Thereat I was silent. But gazing eagerly thereon, I beheld one appointed, and I understood that the oak - leaf was sent from the House. Then I took counsel of him who is to this end appointed, and with his own hand he brought to me a champak - blossom, a mustard - seed, and again an oak - leaf. And these I treasured in my bosom, though I hardly knew wherefore. Nor could I understand what purpose they should serve, save darkly. And seeing this, the dove came to me again bearing an olive - branch; and with this I was so mightily pleased that for awhile I forgot all else, and swam lustily in the stream for my pleasure. But now came a current of ice - cold water and enwrapped me; and when I looked, it bore spots of blood upon it. Then I w ent hastily into the ark that was ever near by; and, climb - ing to the roof by the ladder that I had before made, looked through. And all the sky was a hurricane, a madness of storm. Now in my eagerness I had approached closely to the roof, so that the st orm whirled me away into itself. One might say that I was the storm. And when I came to myself I was floating upon the bosom of the river, borne by that very bark that once I had built myself in the lighthouse. And in the storm I had lost my hair and be ard; for the wind had torn all out by the root. So that I heard a voice saying, “It is a babe upon the waters.” And looking at the bark, I found it refashioned by him that is appointed to refashion. For it had planks of my old shallop, and planks also o f the ark, and it was shaped like a cradle rather than like a boat. And I heard the voice of one appointed to speak saying: “Behold thou me!”"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE ELECTRIC SILENCE 63 And I could not. Nevertheless I gazed earnestly, and paddled in the direction of the sound. While this was a - doi ng suddenly the river fell in a cataract. And I looked for the olive - branch, and it was withered, and sunk beneath the stream. And I looked for the dove, and it was wrapped round with a most hideous serpent. And I was helpless. In the end he devoured th at rose - winged companion of my journey, and went seeking a new prey. Now in this cataract I had most surely been wrecked but that I clung tightly to the boat. This indeed floated as serenely as if it had been upon the still waters of a lake; and when I ha d a little plucked up courage, I saw sitting at the helm him that is appointed to steer; I saw him face to face. This then endured for a space; and with his aid I began ship - building. “For” (said he) “there are many that swim, and find no boats. Be it thy task to aid them.” Of my journey to the House he spake nothing. But in the ship - building came the fair man my brother to my help; and one evening as we sate at meat he said: May it please you to enter the House; for there is prepared for you a goodly be dchamber. But I would not at that time; for I was ashamed, being unclothed; not understanding that in the House robes are provided by him that is appointed to provide them. Thus we laboured, and built many fair shallops upon the model of that wherein we s ailed. In all these there was not one splinter of wood too much, or too little; and there was no ornament; and neither paint nor varnish covered the planks, for they were planks of a tree that cometh neither from the East nor from the West. But the sails were of gold tissue, very brave, with figures inwoven."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 64 Now at last the time being come, did I take my chamber in the House. And upon the secret things that were there shown to me I ponder yet; so that in this place I shall make no mention of them. But t his treasure will I give out, that everything noble in that House seemeth vile to them that are swimming in the stream; and everything vile to them appeareth noble. Thus they endure not the delicate stuffs with rough and impure handling; and the rubbish t hey carry away with them, and devour. Thus wisely hath the master of the House ordained. Now of the silver radiance that issueth from the darkness of the House I will say nothing; nor of the golden ray that illuminateth the darkness of the House. But for the sake of one that may come to share my bed - chamber will I speak of the last adventure. Upon the breast of the river came a wild swan, singing, and for a moment rested upon mine image reflected in the water. And I said: “Come up hither.” And the wild swa n said: “How shall I come up thither?” I : I will guide thee. The Swan : Who art thou? I : My Father is the keeper of the King's Cup: I have prepared a little ship wherein I may go my journeys upon the great river. Who will draw it? The Swan : I will draw it. So we set forth together; and of the horrible tempests that arose it is unworthy discourse. And of what followed after is discourse unprofitable; but the wild swan still guides my ship."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE ELECTRIC SILENCE 65 And the end shall be as is appointed by the master of the House; but this I know, that this ship is the King's ship.

And the wild swan sings ever; and my heart si ngs ever. . . . . . . Now then I had laid aside the pen, and a voice cried: Write! Fear not! Turn not aside!

This much Edgar Rolles smelt rather than saw; for as he turned to her, he caught her eyes. They were the eyes of an enthusiast, of a saint, of an ascetic — but of a saint who, strong in his agony through faith and hope and love, still endures the Dark Night of the Soul. “You shall lunch with me, nice boy” (she said), “and beg my pardon for your stumble, and pay for your lunch by telling me what drives you mad wit h laughter at the sight of the Pantheon.

She gave a little shiver. “What do you want?” he said, with the man’s alarm when he at last meets the woman he may be able to love. “Your body and soul,” she answered solemnly; her eyes sank into his, like a dagger into the belly of a faithless Kabyle woman. “But beyond that, your secret!

Twice he knocked him through the ropes. The first time he rose unsteadily, only to fall instantly. The second time his friends, careless of the rules, helped him to rise.

Do you hear?” she cried, “I want truth, I want Truth.” “I want you,” said Joe Marie. “We are both in trouble, then,” she smiled back. “And perhaps if we had our wish, we should both be disappointed.

They were alone in the gallery. “You may kiss the back of my neck, if you like.” The negro buried his head between her shoulders. She shivered; h er hair hissed under his kiss. She writhed round, and gave her mouth to his for one clinging moment. Then she pushed herself away, and he, poor troubled animal, went swiftly and sleekly from the room. At the corner he staggered.

A quarter of a mile away, at that moment, Edgar Rolles was tearing the edges from a “petit bleu.” “I am paying the penalty,” he read. “Lunch with me at Lavenue’s at one to - morrow.

The cafe pricked up its ears, and dissolved in laughter at the culminating impossibility. But Edgar Rolles only frowned. “I am sorry for Ida,” he said slowly. “If your story were true I should be glad; but she is only the painter with his palette mixing paints: she never gives her soul up to the canvas. Tigress? yes: but not the Bodhi - sattva who let the tigress eat him. She always wins; she cannot lose. As the proverb says: ‘Lucky at play, unlucky in love — and ‘God is love.’ ” “Listen! he is saying the Black Mass again,” cried Ninon, and springing on a table began the Dance of the Postman's Knock, just then the rage of Montparnasse before the infection spread to Paris and London. A Polish youth jumped on to the table opposite and joined her; in a minute the whole cafe w as aflame with it. But Edgar Rolles, his hands thrust deep into his pockets, and the threat of tears in his eyes, was walking back to his studio. “If only life were folly!” he sighed. “But the silliest things we do are wisdom — somehow, somewhere —— ” And he let himself in. * * * * * The lunch in the private room at Lavenue's was secretly amusing.

The artist, the initiate, thus frames his mysteries. The rest of the world scoff, or seek to understand, or pretend to understand; some few obtain the truth. The technical ability of the artist is the lucidity of his language; it has nothing to do with the degree of his illumination. Bougereau is better technically than Manet; he explains more clearly what he sees. But what does he see? He is the priest of a false God. Form has no importance except in this sense; we must not be revolted by the extravagance of new symbolic systems. Gauguin and Matisse may live to be understood. We acquiesce in the eccentr icities of Raphael.” Ida gave a little laugh of pleased scorn of him. “My good girl, perspective is an eccentricity, a symbol; no more. How can one ever represent a three - dimensional world in two dimensions? Only by symbolism. We have acquiesced in the method of the primitives — do you think men and women are really like Fra Angelico's pictures look to the eye of the untaught? We may one day acquiesce in all the noughts and crosses of Nadelmann! It’s the same everywhere.

Sensible men prefer a good photograph of nature to a bad landscape. The photograph shows them the view of th eir own normal eye through the medium of an accepted symbolism; the picture shows the view of an indifferent bad soul through a medium of mud. But Corot! But Whistler! But Morrice! Corot sees a wood, and paints Pan; Bougereau sees a pretty model, and p aints a pretty model. He doesn't paint Woman. Morrice paints the Venice of Byron, of our historic and voluptuous dreams; not the Venice of the Yankee and the churning steamers. Raphael found Madonna in his mistress; Rembrandt a queen of sombre passion a nd seduction in his wife. In one way or another we must get to God’s meaning through a medium that itself is meaningless.” “Just as through dejeuner we get to the dessert!” laughed Ida, who had something more to say than her face showed. All through lunc h she had allured the big black savage, until beneath her glances he was in agony. All the primitive passions fought one another in his heart. He could have killed Rolles for the very nonchalance of his small - talk. It hurt him that anyone should speak t o Ida save in words of love. Equally, he could have killed him for a trace of inflection in his voice. Edgar Rolles understood his torture, understood the sup - pressed intensity of Ida's purpose, though he could not guess its nature.

He shrugged his sh oulders, and surrendered to the event. “Mr Rolles,” she said, “it is your advice on life that we are asking. Let us talk seriously.

A CURIOUS idea is being sedulously disseminated, and appears to be gaining ground, that mysticism is the “Safe” Path to the Highest, and magic the dangerous Path to the Lowest. There are several comments to be made on this assertion. One may doubt whether anything worth doing at all is free from danger, and one may wonder what danger can threaten the man whose ob ject is his own utter ruin. One may also smile a little grimly at the integrity of those who try to include all Magic under Black Magic, as is the present trick of the Mystic Militant here on earth. Now, as one who may claim to a slight acquaintance with the literature of both paths, and to have been honoured by personal exposition from the adepts of both paths, I believe that I may be able to bring them fairly into the balance. This is the magical theory, that the first departure from the Infinite must b e equilibrated and so corrected. So the “great magician,” Mayan, the maker of Illusion, the Creator, must be met in combat. Then “if Satan be divided against Satan, how shall his kingdom stand?” Both vanish: the illusion is no more. Mathematically, 1 + ( – 1 ) = 0 . And this path is symbolised in the Taro under the figure of the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 154 Magus, the card numbered 1 , the first departure from 0 , but referred to Beth, 2 , Mercury, the god of Wisdom, Magic and Truth. And this Magus has the twofold aspect of the Magician himself and also of the “Great Magician” described in Liber 418 ( E QUINOX , No. V., Special Supplement, p. 144 ). Now the formula of the mystic is much simpler. Mathematically, is is 1 – 1 = 0 . He is like a grain of salt cast into the sea; the process of d issolution is obviously easier than the shock of worlds which the magician contemplates. “Sit down, and feel yourself as dust in the presence of God; nay, as less than dust, as nothing,” is the all - sufficient simplicity of his method. Unfortunately, man y people cannot do this. And when you urge your inability, the mystic is only too likely to shrug his shoulders and be done with you. This path is symbolised by the “Fool” of the Tarot, who is alike the Mystic and the Infinite. But apart from this ques tion, it is by no means certain that the formula is as simple as it seems. How is the mystic to assure himself that “God” is really “God” and not some demon masquerading in His image? We find Gerson sacrificing Huss to his “God”; we find a modern journ alist who has done more than dabble in mysticism writing, “This mystic life at its highest is undeniably selfish”; we find another writing like the old lady who ended her criticism of the Universe, “There’s only Jock an’ me’ll be saved; an’ I’m no that sur e o’ Jock”; we find another who at the age of ninety - nine foams at the mouth over an alleged breach of her"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"THE DANGERS OF MYSTICISM 155 alleged copyright; we find another so sensitive that the mention of his name by the present writer induces an attack of epileptic mania; if such are really “united with” or “absorbed in” God, what of God? We are told in Galations that the fruits of the Spirit are peace, love, joy, long - suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperence; and somewhere else, “By their fruits ye shall know them. ” Of these evil - doers then we must either think that they are dishonest, and have never attained at all, or that they have united themselves with a devil. Such are “Brethren of the Left Hand Path,” described so thoroughly in Liber 418 ( E QUINOX , No. V., Spe cial Supplement, pp. 119 sqq .). Of these the most characteristic sign is their exclusive - ness. “We are the men.” “Ours is the only Way.” “All Buddhists are wicked,” the insanity of spiritual pride. The Magician is not nearly so liable to fall into this fearful mire of pride as the mystic; he is occupied with things outside himself, and can correct his pride. Indeed, he is constantly being corrected by Nature. He, the Great One, cannot run a mile in four minutes! The mystic is solitary and shut up, l acks wholesome combat. We are all schoolboys, and the football field is a perfect prophylactic of swelled head. When the mystic meets an obstacle, he “makes believe” about it. He says it is “only illusion.” He has the morphino - maniac’s feeling of bie n - être, the delusions of the general paralytic.

If contradicted on the subject, he is cross and spiteful and cattish .

Such persons “swollen with wind, and the rank mist they draw, Rot inwardly, and foul contag ion spread,” as Milton wrote of a less dangerous set of spiritual guides. For their unhappy followers and imitators, no words of pity suffice. The whole universe is for them but “the glass of their fool’s face”; only, unlike Sir Palamedes, they admire i t. Moral and spiritual Narcissi, they perish in the waters of illusion. A friend of mine, a solicitor in Naples, has told me strange tales of where such self - adoration ends. And the subtlety of the devil is shown particularly in the method by which neo phytes are caught by the Black Brothers. There is an exaggerated awe, a solemnity of diction, a vanity of archaic phrases, a false veil of holiness upon the unclean shrine. Stilted affectation masquerades as dignity; a rag - bag of mediævalism apes profu ndity; jargon passes for literature; phylacteries increase about the hem of the perfect prig, prude, and Pharisee. Corollary to this attitude is the lack of all human virtue. The greatest magician, when he acts in his human capacity, acts as a man should . In paraticular, he has learnt kind - heartedness and sympathy. Unselfishness is very often his long suit. Just this the mystic lacks. Trying to absorb the lower planes into the higher, he neglects the lower, a mistake no magician could make."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"THE DANGERS OF MYSTICISM 157 The Nun G ertrude, when it came to her turn to wash up the dishes, used to explain that she was very sorry, but at that particular moment she was being married, with full choral service, to the Saviour. Hundreds of mystics shut themselves up completely and for ever. Not only is their wealth - producing capacity lost to society, but so is their love and good - will, and worst of all, so is their example and precept. Christ, at the height of his career, found time to wash the feet of his disciples; any Master who does no t do this on every plane is a Black Brother. The Hindus honour no man who becomes “Sannyasi” (nearly our “hermit”) until he has faithfuly fulfilled all his duties as a man and a citizen. Celibacy is immoral, and the celibate shirks one of the greatest di fficulties of the Path. Beware of all those who shirk the lower difficulties: it’s a good bet that they shirk the higher difficulties too. Of the special dangers of the path there is here no space to write; each student finds at each step temptations refle cting his own special weakness.

This lengthy treatise upon the simplest of subjects is more free from pedantry and theological bias than was perhaps to be expected. It is very complete in its way as regards Christian mysticism; but the attempt to restrict the term mysticism to Christian mysticism must fail. It is indeed self - destructive. To ex clude the authors of the Bhagavadgita, the Voice of the Silence, Knox Om Pax, and the Tao Teh King is to exclude by implication St. Teresa. To deny Crowley is to deny Christ. Similarly, the attempt to define Magic in terms contrary to its tradition, is s ectarian folly.

And we think that his sense of awe misleads him in one respect. The Buddha, the Christ, and He whom some of us know as Frater Perdurabo, were all men before they became lost in the Infinity of what some call the One, others the All, others the Naught; and their documents are accessible. These documents are of immeasurably greater value tha n the lesser writings of the mediaeval saints. In fact, this word mediaeval is of use to us in describing Evelyn Underhill’s state of mind. He, she, or it is rather narrow, vastly learned and curiously ignorant, capable of seeing far from within, utterly incapable of seeing an inch from without, a bit of a heresy - hunter and so on. It is clear that the mystic vision even is not his, or how could he remain sectarian? Had he only enough imagination to think of the earth as seen from Cor Scorpionis, all su ch diatribes would seem infinitely petty. We may splutter about with our little verbal fireworks, as I am doing now; but to take it seriously! “There's nothing serious in mortality;” God is All in All. The Universe is but a mote playing in that sunbea m; why bother to fill 600 dull pages? Nothing is worth writing but literature.

The Vitality book was the scream of a schoolgirl. The “theories” of these writers are, however, too comic to discuss seriously. One believes in “Life,” a mystical entity flowing through one like a grease - spot through a greenback; the other believes that Death is caused by a man's hypnotising himself into the belief that i t must come! Big as is the present volume, it is necessarily far from complete. Yet I am compelled to admit much against my will that he makes out a very strong case for the persistence of personality after death, and its manifestation through certain med iums. Yet I think that the “coincidence” argument is a little better than is supposed. The point is that the failures are unrecorded. Take “pure chance” roulette for example. Scientifically, any given run (say 500 on the red) is no more and no less rema rkable than any other given run, say R B B R R B B B R R R B B B B, etc., to 500 coups. But the one is acclaimed as a miracle, the other goes unremarked."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 162 Now in the millions of séances of the last sixty years the “evidential” records can be counted in th e fingers of one hand. And it is not antecedently so very improbable that pure chance might dictate correct answers in so small a proportion of cases. Further, the spiritists have thrown upon science the task of proving a universal negative. If Sir Oliver Lodge, or Professor Munsterberg, or Lord Cholly Cauliflower, or Mr Upthe Pole comes to me with a tale of unicorns in Piccadilly, I merely humour him. Munsterberg, at least, might be dangerous. But I should not investigate his statement, and I certainly s hould not claim to be able to disprove it on à priori grounds. Even in the evidential cases, there is so much room for a mixture of fraud, telepathy, chance, and hysteria, and humanity is so cleaver at stopping chinks with putty and then leaving the door o pen, that we must continue to suspend judgment. An amusing case occurred some years ago at Cambridge. I offered to reproduce roughly the performance of the Zancigs (which was then puzzling the foolish in London) without preparation. A stranger to me offe red to act as my “medium.” The conditions were these. The ten small cards of a suit were laid on the floor; one was to be touched in the medium's absence and in my presence. The medium was to return and say which it was. The rest of the company were to prevent us from communicating if they could. Well, they tried everything. In a minute’s interview I arranged a button - touching code with my medium, and as each new restriction was put on me I managed to invent a new code. Shifting my pipe, coughing, arra nging books, winking, altering the position of my fingers, etc., etc., all were provided against. Then I obtained a confederate. Ultimately the grand sceptic of all devised the following test just as I had passed the note to my medium, “If I can’t manage any of the old ways, I’ll try and write down the number and put it on the mantelpiece.” And this was the test. The medium was to be taken from Whewell’s Court (were we were) over to the Great Court of Trinity — well out of all hearing. I was to be left al one with the sceptic, who by this time suspected everybody of being a confederate. He was to touch the card in my presence and then take me away in the opposite direction. The medium was then (at a given time) to return, and tell the card. Now it happ ened that in the course of general argument about fairness, which I encouraged to enable myself to plot unnoticed in the confusion of talk, that I had stipulated for my sceptic to write down the number that he had"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE BIG STICK 163 touched, to avoid dispute. This he agreed to; he was allowed to hide it as he chose. I gave up all hope but in bringing off the 9 to 1 chance of my medium's being right. The sceptic kept both eyes on me all the time; if I stirred a finger, he was up in arms. I did keep my back to the mantelpiece , but there was no way of writing down the number. But it was just at that point that my sceptic’s magnificent brain broke down. He had correctly argued everything so far; but then his brain said, “It is important that Crowley shall not know where I hide t he paper with the number on it: I must hide it somewhere where he cannot see.” So instead of slipping it into one of the hundreds of books on the shelves, the hid it behind my back, i.e. on the mantlepiece, where it was duly found! I must tell just one oth er story to the point. It throws possibly some light on one or two of the “miracles” which Blavatzsky performed in order to disgust the more foolish of her followers. In June 1906 I was at Margate (God help me!), and asked my friend J —— to lend me his cop y of Abramelin. “Sorry!” said he. “I lent it to So - and - so, and it has not been returned.” He forgot this conversation: I remembered it. Staying at his house six months later, I was alone one morning and found the book, which he “knew for a fact” to be in London sixty miles away. It was hidden by the panel of a glass - fronted bookcase. I hid it in the stuffing of a music - stool, led the conversation at lunch - time to “apports,” got my host to suggest my doing this very thing which he was sure I could not do, and, in the evening, did it. If I had been a cheat, could I have produced better evidence? My host would have sworn that the book was in London in a house unknown to me, whose occupants were unknown to me. He is a man of science and of most accurate and balanced judgment. One little lapse of memory: he forgot that he had told me that the book was not in his shelves; another little lapse of memory: he forgot where the book was; and there is your miracle! Now for my constructive policy. I suggest that a “s pirit” be cultivated on the lines laid down by Eliphaz Levi, “Dogma and Ritual,” Chap. XIII., so that he may manifest more wholly. Then let him dictate to two or three segregated mediums a long passage, or a long set of meaningless figures, and get so hig h a degree of agreement that hardly any doubt remains. Or if anybody wants a really high evidential proof, let him get the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, which Fermat died without revealing, and which the united efforts of mathematicians have hitherto fai led to discover.

Being an Estoeric Interpretation of T HE I NITIATION O F I OANNES . By J AMES M. P RYSE . New York; John M. Pryse, 9 - 15 Murray Street, 1910 . Lon don: J. M. Watkins. 8 s . 6 d . net It is possible to write upon this book in a freer manner, without offence, than upon any other book in the Canon of Scripture, for there is no other book which has caused so much disquiet to theologians, in all ages, as has the “Revelation of St John the Divine,” and it is but in comparatively recent times that it has been generally accepted as Canonical, and this even by those who admit that they do not understand it; and to such as these the “Apocalypse Unsealed” will be a veritable “Revelation” indeed. Mr James M. Pryse accepts it unreservedly as the work of the Apostle John, but we ought to mention that there is a long string of authorities against this view. Dionysius, who was surnamed the Great, of Alexandria, was a pupil of Origen, and he of Clement of Alexandria, all catechists of the Arcane Discipline which taught a Christianised version of the older Gnosis, which Clement and others had brought into the Church from the older secret, or occult, societies of which th ey were, or had been members. This Dionysius makes a certain John the Presbyter, as of note in Asia Minor in the 1 st century, and distinct from the Apostle, to be the author of the book. Presbyter Cajus, or Gaius, of Rome, and the Alogi, attributed it t o Cerinthus, a Gnostic of the independent sect of these, and Eusebius quotes both Dionysius and these Alogi; Nicephorus Callistus uses the same as saying that some who had preceded them had manipulated the book in such way, in every chapter, that the orig inal could not be recognised. This may be an exaggeration, but amongst the eminent critics who have denied the authenticity of the book may be mentioned these, and what else can we expect when none to the present time could understand it? Against it are D e Wett, Bleek, Ewald, Credner, Schott, Lucke, Neander, Michaelis, who treat the style as utterly foreign to that of John the Apostle. The first - named observes that “Revelation” is characterised by strong Hebraisms, ruggedness, and exhibits the absence of pure Greek words, whilst in the Gospel of John is to be found a calm, deep feeling, but in the Apocalypse we have great creative power of fancy; — the two minds are at variance with each other. St Jerome had an"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"THE BIG STICK 165 exalted opinion of the book, and says that i t has much of mystery therein; possibly he saw it with the same eyes as Mr Pryse. Even both Luther and Erasmus were doubtful as to its acceptance. The “Encyclopaedia Britannica” argues that its allusions are of the 4 th or 5 th century. It may be mentione d here, that Dom John Chapman, D.O.S., has made an examination of the question this year, and argues, with doubtful success, that John the Presbyter and John the Apostle were the same person, and accepts both the Gospel and the Apocalypse as the works of A postle John, and accounts for the difference in style as that of the amanuensis whom the Apostle John employed. Two noticable, but irreconcilable, attempts have in recent years been made to interpret the book, theologically and historically. The learned Dr E. V. Kenealy made sense out of it, but overdid the subject. He believed it to represent the Apocalyptic church of Adam, and found in its addresses to the “Seven Churches” the existence of a great Asian hierarchy of the seven temples of the “twenty - four Ancients,” and further, in its various characters, the acts of the twelve divine incarnations, or messengers, who follow each other at periods of 600 years, as taught in regard to the manifestations of Vishnu. Then, in 1906 , we have a book of the astron omer, Nicholas Marazoff, verified by the astronomers Ramin and Lanin, who attempt an astrological view, grounded on the state of the heavens at Patmos on the 30 th September 395 , at 5 o'clock at night. Jupiter — the white horse — was then in Sagittarius; whils t Saturn — the pale horse — was in Scorpio; the sun in Virgo, and the moon under her feet. John Chrysostom was then in Patmos, and immediately after 395 was called to Rome to become a presbyter; but Rome finding that the “Second Coming” did not take place, i t is argued that he was deprived and banished as a “false prophet.” Against this we have the fact that Chrysostom does not mention the book, but the date assigned agrees with criticisms as the book now stands. We must defer to the superior knowledge of t his modern “Unveiler,” though personally I am inclined to accept the views of those early Fathers who assign the authorship to Cerinthus, and also the later German critics, who believe that the first three chapters and the last have been added by a later hand, and other portions altered to agree with the Scriptures held to be orthodox. Of course this, if it were so, does not effect in any way the views of Mr Pryse, but rather strengthens them, as I look upon the imagery of the book as essen - tially that of the earlier and pre - Christian Gnostics. Though we may not have absolute proof of the great antiquity of the Gnosis, such as Mr Pryse unveils, yet it is clearly Aryan, dating from the time of Momu — the thinker; then again the development of the Kundali ni — serpent fire — world's mother, also termed rousing the Brahm — is said to be shown as issuing from the foreheads of early"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 166 Egyptian kings; Apollonius of Tyana, a contemporary of our Jesus, visited the Gymnosophists of the Upper Nile, but said that they were not equal to those of India. The British Druids must have had a knowledge of the “Serpent fire” in their secret instruction, or why exclaim, “I am a serpent.” The Mythraic Mysteries, and all the Eranoi Societies, were equally protected by the laws of Sol on seven centuries B . C ., and Mr Pryse observes that only once does the word Halleluiah occur in the Bible, yet we know that it formed the close of a chant in the “Rites of Purification” in a call to the slain god for deliverance, in pre - Christian centuries , and further there are Mythraic traces in Revelation. We also know from a large mass of inscriptions found in recent times, that the early Christians made use of the very ancient societies, and by that course spread their doctrine. Before the issue of t he “Unsealing,” the same translator published the “Magical Message of Iôannes,” a translation of great value which receives much additional light from the later work, and the more so as it supplies, in a know - ledge of Hermetic Greek, much meaning which esc apes us in the authorised version. In the “Unsealing,” Mr. Pryse goes solid for the book, the whole book, and nothing but the book, as the veritable work of the Apostle John, hence the clergy may extend a welcome hand to it. He quite believes it is a work of the Apostle John, and defends the style; amongst these there are some doubtless who are narrow - minded, but here, and still more prominently in America, there are broad - minded clergy who will welcome the Unsealing. The Freemasons too in their higher gra des, which have more or less reached us through the Rosicrucians, have very strong allusions to the Apocalypse, and may profit by it, and this refers to several systems practised throughout the world. Thus the Order of Hérédom (Harodim) Rosy Cross, which h as an unchanged Ritual from 1740 , at least, draws upon Dionysius the Areopagite, a disciple of St Paul, and it has also a rhythmetical description of the New Jerusalem. Again, two entire degrees of the Scottish Rite of 33 ° are drawn from the Apocalypse, and certainly entered the Rite before 1758 , and seem as if they were drawn bodily from the Rosicrucian Militia of the Cross: I allude to the 17 ° Knight of the East and West, and the 19 ° of Grand Pontiff, which treat upon the Heavenly Jerusalem, and the op ening scene of the Revelations. It was rather a pity that when the late Albert Pike was revising the Rituals, he did not consolidate the Rite by changing the places of the 17 ° with the 20 °, which latter treats of Zerubbabel. His predecessor Morin, in 1 767 , did a like thing by the Amalgamation of Prince Adept, which he had in his patent of 1762 , with Knight of the Sun, and supplying the blank thus created with Patriarch Noachite. There is also the Royal Oriental Order of the Sat Bhai which was founded 1 743 - 5 by a Brahmin Pundit at Prag, for certain Anglo - Indian officers, and which is now well established in America."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"THE BIG STICK 167 The idea that Revelation is a book of Initiation is not altogether new to Freemasons, as the late Dr Geo. Oliver elaborated that view at con siderable length, but Mr Pryse's view is quite a different sort of Initiation; it is the development of the semi - miraculous powers of the Gnosis of Clement, Origen, and the early Christian Church, the birth of the divine three principles, the Crestos, in t he human soul. The key to this “Unsealing” is the text itself, in which is found the Nos. 333 , 444 , 666 , 777 , 888 , 999 , 1000 , as applied to the seven principal “chakras” of the human body, as taught by Greek Yogis. Apart altogether from the possession of a reliable literal translation of the book, there are seventy - five pages upon the development of the Kundalini , and each subject is followed in the text by a commentary in application. Mr Pryse expresses the view that the book is necessarily incomprehens ible to the conventional theologian, yet easily comprehended by the esoteric Initiate, i.e. by him who possesses the Gnosis, and that the drama is perfect in all its parts. I may add that most of this class of Initiative books had a double interpretation , and hence that the same may be equally found in the Apocalypse, but into this Mr Pryse does not enter.    J OHN Y ARKER . Mr Pryse has undoubtedly found the key of the Apocalypse, and many of his interpretations are profound and accurate. But he is afflicted by sexual mania to an extent positively shocking, and does not understand the harmony of the principles. Adeptship is balanced growth, not lopping. A rose dies if you remove the root and stalk, Mr Pryse! He is unfortunately a poor scholar, an d has developed the American literary sense to an incredible point. He translates ¢krasia , “impotence, lack of control,” as “sensuality,” ¢ggeloj as “divinity,” and gives us “saucers” for “vials”! Unfortunately, too, he has studied Eastern Mysticism at s econd - hand, through Theosophical spectacles. Nor has he kept even to Blavatsky the genius, but relied upon her commentators, who had neither her learning nor her experience. But he has the key, and it opens the way for a real study of “St John” by a pers on of greater ability. It is a very remarkable fact, however, that Akrasia ( 333 ) and Akolasia ( 333 ) should so accurately describe Choronzon ( 333 ). No higher test of the truth of “The Vision and the Voice” could be desired.

To the pharmacist it is an extremely useful book, and in a great ma ny instances furnishes information of an interesting character, which the busy man would have difficulty in finding in pharmaceutical history. To the student of the occult it ought to appeal strongly, as the author gives a long list of drugs used in relig ious ceremonies in different ages, and although the present century is so much in advance, we find that the incenses and sweet odours used in ceremonial magic to - day are the same as those used in Egypt, in the worship of Isis, and in the services held in t he Temple of Solomon. Mention is also made of the preparations made by the ancient alchemists which were thought to have magic power. Short biographical sketches of some of the old masters of pharmacy appear, but after Liebig we have no special mention o f the pharmacists of the last century. A interesting chapter on Poisons in History, introducing the stories of poisoners and the drugs employed, furnishes material for the budding novelist, to whom in fact the whole of this excellent work may be recommende d. To the occult reader the concluding chapter on names and symbols would be of considerable service, and might be useful for reference.

M AC G REGOR - M ATHERS . 4 to, black cloth, Magical Square on side in gold . 1900 . (Pub. at 21 s )., Postage free. 10 s . 6 d . The original work, of which this is a translation, is unique, no other copy being known, although both Bulwer Lytton and Eliphas Levi were well aware of its existence; the forme r having based part of his description of the sage Rosicrucian Menjour on that of Abra - Melin, while the account of the so - called Observatory of Sir Philip Derval in the Strange Story was, to some extent, copied from that of the Magical Oratory and Terrace given in the present work. There are also other interesting points too numerous to be given here in detail. It is felt therefore that by its publication a service is rendered to lovers of rare and curious Books, and to Students of Occultism, by placing wit hin their reach a magical work of so much importance, and one so interestingly associated with the respective authors of Zanoni and of the Dogma and Ritual of Transcendental Magic . The Magical Squares or combinations of letters, placed in a certain manner , are said to possess a peculiar species of automatic intelligent vitality, apart from any of the methods given for their use; and students are recommended to make no use of these whatever unless this higher Divine Knowledge is approached in a frame of min d worthy of it. ———————— FRANK HOLLINGS, 7 GREAT TURNSTILE, HOLBORN, W.C."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":" JENNINGS (Hargrave).

A ∴ A ∴ PUBLICATION IN CLASS B. ================= BOOK 777 777 HIS book contains in concise tabulated form a comparative view of all the symbols of the great religions of the world; the perfect attributions of the Taro, so long kept secret by the Rosicrucians, are now for the first time published; also the complete secret magical correspondences of the G ∴ D ∴ and R. R. et A. C. It forms, in short, a c omplete magical and philosophical dictionary; a key to all religions and to all practical occult working. For the first time Western and Qabalistic symbols have been harmonized with those of Hinduism, Buddhism, Mohammedanism, Taoism, &c. By a glance at th e Tables, anybody conversant with any one system can understand perfectly all others. The Occult Review says: “Despite its cumbrous sub - title and high price per page, this work has only to come under the notice of the right people to be sure of a ready sal e. In its author’s words, it represents ‘an attempt to systematise alike the data of mysticism and the results of comparative religion,’ and so far as any book can succeed in such an attempt, this book does succeed; that is to say, it condenses in some six ty pages as much information as many an intelligent reader at the Museum has been able to collect in years. The book proper consists of a Table of ‘Correspondences,’ and is, in fact, an attempt to reduce to a common denominator the symbolism of as many re ligious and magical systems as the author is acquainted with. The denominator chosen is necessarily a large one, as the author's object is to reconcile systems which divide all things into 3, 7, 10, 12, as the case may be. Since our expression ‘common de nominator' is used in a figurative and not in a strictly mathematical sense, the task is less complex than appears at first sight, and the 32 Paths of the Sepher Yetzirah, or Book of Formation of the Qabalah, provide a convenient scale. These 32 Paths are attributed by the Qabalists to the 10 Sephiroth, or Emanations of Deity, and to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which are again subdivided into 3 mother letters, 7 double letters, and 12 simple letters. On this basis, that of the Qabalistic ‘Tree of Life,' as a certain arrangement of the Sephiroth and 22 remaining Paths connecting them is termed, the author has constructed no less than 183 tables. “The Qabalistic information is very full, and there are tables of Egyptian and Hindu deities, as well a s of colours, perfumes, plants, stones, and animals. The information concerning the tarot and geomancy exceeds that to be found in some treatises devoted exclusively to those subjects. The author appears to be acquainted with Chinese, Arabic, and other c lassic texts. Here your reviewer is unable to follow him, but his Hebrew does credit alike to him and to his printer. Among several hundred words, mostly proper names, we found and marked a few misprints, but subsequently discovered each one of them in a printed table of errata, which we had overlooked. When one remembers the misprints in ‘Agrippa’ and the fact that the ordinary Hebrew compositor and reader is no more fitted for this task than a boy cognisant of no more than the shapes of the Hebrew lett ers, one wonders how many proofs there were and what the printer’s bill was. A knowledge of the Hebrew alphabet and the Qabalistic Tree of Life is all that is needed to lay open to the reader the enormous mass of information contained in this book. The ‘ Alphabet of Mysticism,’ as the author says — several alphabets we should prefer to say — is here. Much that has been jealously and foolishly kept secret in the past is here, but though our author has secured for his work the imprimatur of some body with the my sterious title of the A ∴ A ∴ , and though he remains himself anonymous, he appears to be no mystery - monger. Obviously he is widely read, but he makes no pretence that he has secrets to reveal. On the contrary, he says, ‘an indicible arcanum is an arcanum which cannot be revealed .’ The writer of that sentence has learned at least one fact not to be learned from books. “G.C.J.” T"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":" WILLIAM NORTHAM, Robemaker , 9 Henrietta Street, Southampton Street, Strand T ELEPHONE — 5400 Central MR.

It appears that confusion arose in certain quarters from some extracts from the work of P.B.

Similarly, “This is the day which do wn the void abysm” in the Rite of Mars is the finale from Prometheus Unbound and “The world’s great age begins anew,” also in the Rite of Mars, is the final chorus from Hellas . Not being particularly familiar with Shelley’s work myself, I may have missed a few others.

And the chaplets of old are ab ove us, And the oyster - bed teems out of reach; Old poets outsing and outlove us, And Catullus makes mouths at our speech. Who shall kiss, in thy father’s own city, With such lips as he sang with, again? Intercede for us all of thy pity, Our Lady of Pai n. Out of Dindymus heavily laden Her lions draw bound and unfed A mother, a mortal, a maiden, A queen over death and the dead. She is cold, and her habit is lowly, Her temple of branches and sods; Most fruitful and virginal, holy, A mother of gods."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":" She hath wasted with fire thine high places, She hath hidden and marred and made sad The fair limbs of the Loves, the fair faces Of gods that were goodly and glad. She slays, and her hands are not bloody; She moves as a moon in the wane, White - robed, and t hy raiment is ruddy, Our Lady of Pain. They shall pass and their places be taken, The gods and the priests that are pure. They shall pass, and shalt thou not be shaken? They shall perish, and shalt thou endure? Death laughs, breathing close and relentle ss In the nostrils and eyelids of lust, With a pinch in his fingers of scentless And delicate dust. But the worm shall revive thee with kisses; Thou shalt change and transmute as a god, As the rod to a serpent that hisses, As the serpent again to a rod . Thy life shall not cease though thou doff it; Thou shalt live until evil be slain, And good shall die first, said thy prophet, Our Lady of Pain. Did he lie? did he laugh? does he know it, Now he lies out of reach, out of breath, Thy prophet, thy preac her, thy poet, Sin’s child by incestuous Death? Did he find out in fire at his waking, Or discern as his eyelids lost light, When the bands of the body were breaking And all came in sight? Who has known all the evil before us, Or the tyrannous secrets of time? Though we match not the dead men that bore us At a song, at a kiss, at a crime — Though the heathen outface and outlive us, And our lives and our longings are twain — Ah, forgive us our virtues, forgive us, Our Lady of Pain."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":" Who are we that embalm and embrace thee With spices and savours of song? What is time, that his children should face thee? What am I, that my lips do thee wrong? I could hurt thee — but pain would delight thee; Or caress thee — but love would repel; And the lovers whose lips wou ld excite thee Are serpents in hell. Who now shall content thee as they did, Thy lovers, when temples were built And the hair of the sacrifice braided And the blood of the sacrifice split, In Lampsacus fervent with faces, In Aphaca red from thy reign, Who embraced thee with awful embraces, Our Lady of Pain? Where are they, Cotytto or Venus, Astarte or Ashtaroth, where? Do their hands as we touch come between us? Is the breath of them hot in thy hair? From their lips have thy lips taken fever, With t he blood of their bodies grown red? Hast thou left upon earth a believer If these men are dead? They were purple of raiment and golden, Filled full of thee, fiery with wine, Thy lovers, in haunts unbeholden, In marvellous chambers of thine. They are fle d, and their footprints escape us, Who appraise thee, adore, and abstain, O daughter of Death and Priapus, Our Lady of Pain. What ails us to fear overmeasure, To praise thee with timorous breath, O mistress and mother of pleasure, The one thing as cert ain as death? We shall change as the things that we cherish, Shall fade as they faded before, As foam upon water shall perish, As sand upon shore."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":" We shall know what the darkness discovers If the grave - pit be shallow or deep; And our fathers of old, and our lovers, We shall know if they sleep not or sleep. We shall see whether hell be not heaven, Find out whether tares be not grain, And the joys of thee seventy times seven, Our lady of Pain. *** ***** ***"}]
