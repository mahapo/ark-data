When Mc Clellan awoke his map was covered with marks and signs and figures, indicating the strategy that prevented the capture of the nation's Capitol. ...

Mere physical reconstruction of ravaged countries and the reorganization of political, economic, and social sys- tems is the lesser task we will face. The larger problem and the great chal- lenge is in how to set up a new order of world ethics firmly established on a foundation of demo- cratic idealism. Experts in various fields have already submitted programs designed to meet the needs of those na- tions whose way of life has been disrupted by war. But with the failing common to specially trained minds, these planners incline to think mostly in the terms of their own particulan interests.

The thinking has been in the dual fields of power politics and material economics, with remedies expressed in terms of charts, blue- prints, patterns, and industrial programs. But, there is one new and encouraging element present in most of the recommendations of today's experts. They are recognizing the. necessity of con- ceiving the world as one inter-dependent structure. Yet, even as they recognize the need for a unity of human interests, their recommendations are for the perpetuation of highly competitive economic policies, which, if they are consistently applied, must lead in the end to war and discord. It is not an easy task to unite the efforts of the human race toward the accomplishment of any common good. Mankind in the majority is selfish, provincial in attitude, and concerned primarily with personal success and acquiring creature comforts. It will not be possible to build an enduring peace until the average man has been convinced that per- sonal selfishness is detrimental to personal happi- ness and personal success. It must be shown that self-seeking has gone out of fashion, and that the world is moving on to a larger conception of living.

If we meet this challenge, we will insure not only survival of our nation for centuries to come, but we shall gain the enduring gratitude of our fellowmen and Americans will be remembered to the end of time as a great enlightened people. It is not enough that we solve particular prob- lems. We must solve the very cause of problem itself. Wars, depressions, crime, dictators and their oppressions, are the symptoms giving clear indica- tion of a greater ailment. To examine each prob- lem solely in terms of the problem itself, without recognition of its true relationship to a larger and more universal necessity, is to fail in the broader implications of an enduring peace and prosperity. Experience should have taught us long ago that policies which have originated from material con- siderations and attitudes have proved inadequate. The whole story of civilization and the records of history tell us that all such adjustments hold no hope of lasting peace or security. But, here we are again preparing ourselves to be satisfied with tem- porary solutions for permanent problems."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"20 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA The recognition is long overdue that we over- simplify the problem of world peace when we think that process is one of breaking the task down for examination of its materialistic parts, and then hopefully devising an applicable remedy for each of these. The physical conditions of human existence are not the whole of the human problem. We could adjust all material considerations to the point of supremest equity, and yet accomplish vir- tually nothing solutional. The greatest of known problems is the human problem. And not until all embracing examination is made into every phase of human needs can there be an adequate reconstruction policy for a postwar world. That man is physical is obvious; but he is also mental, and emotional; he is spiritual, and he has a soul. These latter factors are not so obvious. What to do about them is not so easy; for they are difficult to understand, and even more difficult to classify and reduce to a working pattern. We as builders of a civilization will have to learn that only when equal consideration is given to each of these elements of man's nature will we arrive at the solutions for the disasters into which men and nations precipitate themselves. Our postwar reconstructors-ours, if not by our selection, at least with our consent-are not out-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ORIGIN OF THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAL 21 standingly qualified for this broader task. Few indeed are the statesmen and politicians who have any conception of man as a spiritual being. And as for military leaders, they are primarily disci- plinarians, invaluable as such in times of war, but not at all emotionally geared to problems of indi- vidualistic peacetime character. And world plan- ners recruited from among our industrial leaders, it must be admitted, are not generally informed on the workings of the human psyche. Those who have made the study of human conduct their life work, the sociologists, have little scientific knowl- edge of the hidden springs that animate that very conduct into its amazing diversity of manifesta- tions. And if a word is to be said for bringing in the clergy, it might be that the theologian planner who will be truly useful will be one who acquires at least some knowledge of the science of biology. We are displaying a woeful lack of vision in the way we fumble with the eternal laws of life. It is not enough that we now hopefully create a setup permitting men to give allegiance with their minds or to serve faithfully with their bodies.

The American nation desperately needs a vision of its own purpose. It must conceive it in a gen- erous idealism, great and strong enough to bind thoughtless and selfish persons to something bigger than themselves. It must recognize that it is in the intangible ideal that the foundations are laid for all seeable good, must know that the truly prac- tical course and the course of hard realism for America is the one that is laid basically in a gen- erous idealism. This is more than an indicated course. It is one that we inevitably must follow, guided by the hand of destiny. Believing this to be so, I dedicate this hook to the proposition that American Democracy is part of a Universal Plan. Our world is ruled by inflexible laws which con- trol not only the motions of the heavenly bodies, but the consequences of human conduct. These Uni- versal motions, interpreted politically, are impelling human society out of a state of autocracy and tyran- ny to democracy and freedom.

Those who attempt to resist this motion destroy themselves. To cooperate with this motion, and to assist Nature in every possible way to the accom- plishment of its' inevitable purpose, is to survive, Thousands of years before the beginning of the Christian era many enlightened thinkers discov- ered the will of God as expressed through Nature in the affairs of men. They made known their discoveries in terms of religions, philosophies, sciences, arts, and politioal systems. These first statements are now the admired monuments of ancient learning. Available to men of today, they are generally ignored. Years of research among the records of olden peoples available in libraries, museums, and shrines of ancient cultures, has convinced me that there exists in the world today, and has existed for thou- sands of years, a body of enlightened humans un- ited in what might be termed, an Order of the Quest'. It is composed of those whose intellectual and spiritual perceptions have revealed to them that civilization has a Secret Destiny-secret, I say, because this high purpose is not realized by the many; the great masses of peoples still live along"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"24 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA without any knowledge whatsoever that they are part of a Universal Motion in time and space. Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Buddha, Jesus and Mohammed are among the greatest names re- corded in history; but it is not customary to re- gard the men who bore these names as statesmen or sociologists. They are thought of as philos- ophers, sages, seers, and mystics, whose doctrines have no application to the political needs of an industrial civilization. Yet it is men like Plato and Buddha who still exercise the most powerful force in mortal affairs toward the perpetuation and pre- servation of a civilized state among all nations. All of the great leaders of ancient times realized and taught that the establishment of a state of per- manent peace among the nations depended upon the release of human ideals, but through properly trained and disciplined minds capable of interpret- ing these ideals in terms of the common good. World democracy was the secret dream of the great classical philosophers. Toward the accom- plishment of this greatest of all human ends they outlined programs of education, religion, and so- cial conduct directed to the ultimate achievement of a practical and universal brotherhood.

In Egypt, Greece, India, and China, the State Mys- teries came into existence. Orders of initiated priest- philosophers were formed as a sovereign body to instruct, advise, and direct the rulers of the States. Thousands of years ago, in Egypt, these mystical orders were aware of the existence of the western hemisphere and the great continent which we call America. The bold resolution was made that this western continent should become the site of the philosophic empire. Just when this was done it is impossible now to say, but certainly the decision was reached prior to the time of Plato, for a thinly veiled statement of this resolution is the substance of his treatise on the Atlantic Islands. One of the most ancient of man's constructive ideals is the dream of a universal democracy and a cooperation of all nations in a commonwealth of States. The mechanism for the accomplishment of this ideal was set in motion in the ancient temples of Greece, Egypt, and India. So brilliant was the plan and so well was it administrated that it has survived to our time, and it will continue to function until the great work is accomplished. Philosophy set up its house in the world to free men by freeing them of their own inordinate de- sires and ambitions. It saw selfishness as the great-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"26 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA est crime against the common good, for selfishness is natural to all who are untutored. It recognized that the mind has to be trained in the laws of thinking before men can be capable of self-ruler- ship. And it knew that the democratic common- wealth can be a reality only when our world is a world of self-ruling men. And so it is from the remote past, from the deep shadows of the medieval world as well as from the early struggles of more modern times, that the power of American democracy has come. But we are only on the threshold of the democratic state. Not only must we preserve that which we have gained through ages of striving, we must also per- fect the plan of the ages, setting up here the ma- chinery for a world brotherhood of nations and races. This is our duty, and our glorious opportunity. It seems to me that the basic plan for the post- war world should be one solidly founded in this great dream of Universal Brotherhood. It is not enough to work on the problem solely in terms of politics and industry.

His superiority does not free him from common responsibility; his is the obligation to assume the greater burden of directing his vision to the well being of all his people. Let us see how this works. We'll go far back to ancient times. Akhnaton, Pharaoh of Egypt, throned under the title Amen-Hotep IV, is often referred to as the first civilized human being. While this may not be literally true, he was definitely the first man in recorded history to exemplify social consciousness in the administration of a great nation. Akhnaton, the beloved child of the Aton, was born at Thebes about 1388 B. C. Like most of the princes of his house, he was extremely delicate as a child, and it was feared that he would not live to reach the throne; as the last of his line, the dynasty would end with him if he died without issue. For this reason he was married in his twelfth year to a ten year old Egyptian girl of noble birth, named Nefertiti. During the childhood of the young king, the Queen mother, Tiy, ruled as regent of the double empire. She is believed to have been of Syrian origin, which would account for the many strange and un-Egyptian ideas in religion, government and art which were developed during the reign of"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE WORLD'S FIRST DEMOCRAT 31 Akhnaton. Queen Tiy, brilliant and capable, had recognized before her son reached his majority that in him were qualities more divine than human. The son became the actual ruler of his country in his eighteenth year; his reign extended for seventeen years. Akhnaton had been ruler of Egypt only about two years when he opposed his will to the priest- hood of Arnon-Ra. By attacking the oldest and most firmly established of all Egyptian institutions, the young Pharaoh created legions of enemies and brought down upon himself the wrath of the reli- gion of the State. He could scarcely have chosen a surer way of complicating the problems of his life. In the midst of this conflict he proclaimed a new spiritual dispensation, and to escape his enemies built a new capitol city, one hundred and .sixty miles up the Nile from Cairo. His new faith was Atonism; and he named his city Khut-en-Aton- the Horizon of the Aton-and dedicated the city with these words: \"Ye behold the City of the Ho- rizon of Aton, which the Aton has desired me to make for Him ~s a monument, in the great name of My Majesty forever. For it was Aton, my Father, that brought me to. this City of the Horizon.\" As High Priest of his new religion, Amen-Hotep IV changed his name to Akhnaton, because the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"32 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA older name included the word Amen, whose faith he had rejected. Charles F. Potter, in his History of Religion, says of Akhnaton that he was, \"the first pacifist, the first realist, the first monotheist, the first democrat, the first heretic, the first humanitarian, the first internationalist, and the first person known to at- tempt to found a religion. He was born out of due time, several thousand years too soon.\" From his twenty-sixth year to his thirty-first year, Akhnaton devoted his life to the perfection of his mystical doctrine in the city which he had built for the Ever Living God. Here he taught the mystery of the Divine Father, and wrote the simple and beautiful poems which have endured and survived time. To Akhnaton, God was not a mighty warrior ruling over Egypt, speaking through the oracles of his priests; he was not a Supreme Being flying through the air in a war chariot leading armies of destruction. Aton was the gentle father who loved all his children, of every race and nation; and desired for them that they should live together in peace and comradeship.

The Aton was the father of all beasts, and fishes, and flowers, and insects. He had fashioned them in his wisdom and preserved them with his love and tenderness. Akhnaton, seated in the garden of his palace, spent many hours watching the flight of birds and listening to the voices of little creatures. He tells us that he found the Aton in all of them; and that his heart went out to them, and he gave thanks for the goodness in everything that lived. This was a Pharaoh who traveled alone through the countryside, meeting the peasants, conversing with slaves, and sharing the simple food of the poor. To the most ignorant man he listened with profound respect, for in each of his subjects he sought and found the life of the Aton. He saw the Universal God shining through the eyes of little children, beheld the beauty of the Aton in the bodies of the men who worked in the fields. He could not understand why others did not see God in everything, as he did. Like most of the great religious leaders, Akhn- aton accepted the social problem of life as part of religion. He could not accept the inequalities of birth, wealth, or physical estate as a justification for men persecuting each other or exploiting one another. He saw every living thing having a di-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"34 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA vine right-a right to live well, to think, to dream, to hope, and to aspire. He saw it the duty of the ruler to protect this beauty in the hearts of his peo- ple, to nourish it, and to give every possible oppor- tunity for its expression and perfection. Religious intolerance was impossible among those who worshipped the Aton, and there was no room for political intolerance in a world governed by the laws of brotherly love. Each man became the protector and comforter of all other men, cherish- ing the dreams of others equally with his own. In his personal life Akhnaton emerges as the first man in history to bring dignity and gentle beauty to the management of his home. He was the father of seven daughters, to whom he was completely devoted, and in his speeches and public pronouncements he always referred to Queen Ne- fertiti as \"my beloved wife.\" It was usual for the Pharaohs to cause themselves to be depicted in great stone carvings upon the walls of their palaces. They were represented as majestic figures, crowned and sceptered; they were shown either seated on their thrones or wielding their weapons against their foes. Akhnaton was the only Pharaoh in the history of Egypt who chose to be depicted with his arm about his wife, with his little daughters playing about and seated on his lap."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE WORLD'S FIRST DEMOCRAT 35 As with the passing years the health of the Pharaoh grew worse, the opposition of the priest- hood of Amon-Ra grew greater; and his reign was complicated by invasions by the Hittite nations.

The dreamer king saw his lands pillaged and his cities conquered; but he would not kill his ene- mies; they, too, were children of the Aton. Akhnaton died in his thirty-sixth year, at the altar of the Aton in the temple of the faith he had created. When his mummy case was found, the follow- ing prayer to the Aton was discovered inscribed on golden foil beneath his feet. \"I breathe the sweet breath which comes forth from Thy mouth.

There can be no doubt that the existence of a great continent in the Western Hemisphere was known to the ancient Greeks. And also to the Egyptians and the Chinese. It is nothing short of foolish to assume that the ancients lacked ships sufficiently seaworthy to navigate the larger oceans. Long before the Christian era, the older civiliza- tion had constructed boats far larger and more sea- worthy than any of the vessels used by Columbus. One of the Ptolemys of Egypt built a ship large enough to have an orchard of fruit trees on the deck, together with swimming pools and fountains stocked with live fish. Calculations based upon Plutarch's description of ancient voyages seem to indicate that the Greeks not only reached the coast of America, but explored the St. Lawrence river and part of the Great Lakes area.

In this blessed land dwelt the Hesperides, the beautiful daughters of Night, and here also at the end of each day the sun came to rest. In po- pular mythology the Hesperic Isles were a kind of terrestrial paradise. Thus, under a thin veil of mystic symbolism, was concealed the account of a Western continent of great size, fertile and rich and abounding in all good things. The ancients believed the earth to be surrounded by the sphere of the constellations, and they assigned to each country the star groups which were above that country's particular area of land. In the arrangement preserved in the writings of Aratus of Soli, the constellation of the eagle spreads its wings accross the North American con- tinent; the serpent winds its coil over Mexico and Central America; and the dragon floats in the sky above Japan and China.

Those who understand it and can use wisely the import of its writings are possessed of the secret of the immortality of human society. The curious fortunes of war brought another Golden Fleece from across the sea, and it is now preserved together with our own; this second parchment is the Magna Charta, the English bill of human rights which was the inspiration behind our American Declaration of Independence.

And so the soil was not im- poverished by thousands of years of intensive cul- tivation, nor were the natural resources ravished to supply the substance to maintain endless wars and ageless feuds. It was the rise of the democratic dream in Europe that supplied the beginning of western civilization. Those in search of a promised land turned to the west. Here was a virgin continent populated only by nomadic Indian tribes, a vast territory suitable in every way for the great human experiment of the democratic commonwealth. By the nineteenth century the American Hes- perides was definitely the land of golden oppor- tunity, and to it came streams of immigration from nearly every country on the earth.

Solon, greatest statesman of the Greek world, was handed this age-old problem when, . about 595 B. c., he was summoned to the leadership of the State with the title, Archon. He was given unlimited powers to reform the economic and constitutional systems of the Athenians.

As time had passed, it had become the custom to carve into these stones the records of mortgage contracts affecting the property which they bounded. Single stones became insufficient after a time, and eventually the added monuments to debt interfered with the plowing of the fields. Solon, investigating the tragedy of the mortgage monument, made several interesting discoveries that were to change the course of human eco- nomics. When poor farmers mortgaged their lands to rich families on neighboring estates, and the debts were not paid, the wealthy landowners moved their boundary stones to include the en- cumbered property, and the previous proprietors became tenants. These tenants were obliged to pay one-sixth of their products for the privilege of working the soil; and if they failed their persons were attached and they became slaves. This was the Attic law which Solon abolished, the law which permitted loans on the security of the debtor's person. When Solon restored the freedom of all who had been enslaved for debt, the reform was highly acceptable of course to the poorer classes; but it found little favor with the landowners.

Thus, back in very olden days, when life was very simple, the basic problems which harassed the State and bur- dened the legislators stemmed from the persisting fallacies of human nature. In further effort to bring some semblance of order out of the Athenian chaos, Solon also at- tempted a reorganization of social classes, giving political existence to large groups never before re- presented in government. He divided the citizenry into four groups reminiscent of old Brahman castes. He then readjusted taxation so that the poorer classes all paid equally an approximate 5 percent of their income. Equalizing the tax bur- den according to individual means paved the way for an equality of representation in the governing body. All citizens who paid taxes were entitled to be heard in matters of the common good, and were privileged to elect magistrates. These steps marked the beginning of the democracy of the ancient Greeks. But the greatest of all of the reforms of Solon took place in the courts of justice. Selection of juries was by lot, with all citizens participating, even the poorest; and these juries were upheld over the pressures of established privileged groups."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"52 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA One of the most curious of Solon's regulations throws light on the difficulties of his time. He forbade that a bride should bring to the house of her husband more than three changes of garment and 'like personal furniture.' He also ordained that each citizen must stand ready to show at any time to properly authorized persons how he ob- tained his living. Any citizen failing to do this would lose his franchise. The drastic changes of Solon made him so many enemies that after a few years he felt he had to relinquish the burden of leadership of the State to regain his honor. Those who hated and feared him, as Archon, promptly renewed their love after he left public office and no longer threatened their ambitions. His term as Archon brought to Solon the realiza- tion of his own inadequacy; and he visited Egypt in search of a larger wisdom. He was received with kindness and every mark of respect by the priests at Sais who served the shrine of the Goddess Isis. To these wise men he told the story of his effort to enlighten the Greeks, and correct the evils in their laws. The. High Priest of Sais is re- ported to have said, \"Alas, you Greeks, you are but children; for you know not the wisdom of the gods.\""},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"FIRST ELECTION OF LAW-MAKERS 53 One night the priests of Sais led Solon through the long dark pasageways of the temple. They descended stone stairs rutted with age and lighted only by flaming torches, came at length to subter- ranean chambers hewn from the living rock. Through these chambers flowed a river. The priests said that this river was the sacred Nile that flowed from Egypt through the underworld to water the fields of the immortals. On the bank of the underground stream a small black boat was waiting, rowed by men who were blind. Accompanied by the High Priest and the torch bearers, Solon was rowed out over the dark waters. The boat stopped on the shores of a tiny island far under ground. The light from the torches fell on two tall columns that glistened; they appeared to be made of some strange metal, covered with curious writing in an unknown language. The High Priest, pointing his golden rod at the pillars, explained their mystery to the astonished Solon. These columns, he said, were placed on the island beneath the ground thousands of years ago by a lost people which had vanished forever from the earth.

And the seven kings led an army against the ancient Greeks and they invaded all of Europe, coming in great ships from the west. This, Solon was told, occured about 9000 years before the seige of Troy. The gods were angry because the seven kings had made war.

So perished the nations of the elder world.\" When Solon returned to Greece it was his inten- tion to take the story of the Atlantic Empire and develop it into a great epic poem; but the infirmity of years and the responsibilities of the State inter- fered. Instead, Solon told the story in the fullest detail to his close friend, Dropis, who in turn re- cited it to his son, Critias. In his 90th year, Critias communicated the narrative to his grandson of the same name who later became a disciple of Socrates.

From the fable we can in- fer that the ten rulers of the Atlantic league were philosopher kings, endowed with all virtues and wise guardians of the public good. These kings obeyed the laws of the divine father of their house, Poseidon, god of the seas. In the capital city of Atlantis stood the temple of Poseidon, and in it a golden figure of the god. In this shrine also stood a column of precious substance inscribed with the laws of enduring empire. The ten kings took their oath together to obey these laws, and they chose one of their number, usually of the family of Atlas, to be the chief of their league. It was written on the column of the law that the ten kings of Atlantis should not take up arms against each other, for any reason. If one of them should break this law the other nine were to unite against him to preserve the peace. In all matters concerning the public good the ten kings were to deliberate together, and each should be mindful of the just needs of the others; for they were the members of one body and re- gents over the lands of a blessed god.

In this way Plato describes the government of the Golden Age, in which men live on earth ac- cording to the laws of heaven. By the three great continents of Atlantis are to be understood, Europe, Asia, and Africa; and by the seven islands, all the lesser peoples of the earth. The league of the ten kings is the cooperative com- monwealth of mankind, the natural and proper form of human government. The Atlantis, there- fore, is the archetype or the pattern of right gov- ernment, which existed in ancient days but was destroyed by the selfishness and ignorance of men. Plato, it must be remembered, was a monarchist \"by philosophic conviction, but his ideal king was the wise man perfect in the virtues and the natural ruler of those less informed than himself. This king was the father of his people, impersonal and unselfish, dedicated to the public good, a servant of both the gods and his fellow men. This king was descended of a divine race; that is, he be- longed to the Order of the Illumined; for those who come to a state of wisdom then belong to the family of the heroes-perfected human beings.

One who achieved this state was by virtue of his own action a superior man, and this superiority was the only aristocracy recognized by Natural Law. Competition is natural to the ignorant; and co- operation is natural to the wise. Obeying the pattern established by the gods, the divine kings bound themselves into the common league to obey its laws, preserve the peace, and punish any whose ambition might impel them to tyranny or conquest. Here then, is a pattern of world government to insure the prosperity of all peoples and activate the preservation of the peace. Plato describes at some length the prosperity of the Atlantic Isles under this benevolent rulership. The citizens were happy, and poverty was un- known. A world trade was established, and the ships of the Atlantean marine traveled the seven seas, bringing rich treasures to the motherland. There was little crime; the arts flourished; and the sciences were cultivated in great universities. Men had no enemies, and war was unknown.

It was Plato's conviction that the human being was not created merely to engage in barter and exchange, but rather to perfect himself as the noblest of the ani- mals, endowed with reason and the natural ruler of the material world. The Critics then describes the gradual change that came about in the course of the ages. In the beginning the Atlanteans saw dearly that their wealth and prosperity increased as a result of friendship. But gradually the divine portion of their consciousness began to fade away in them; their souls became diluted with a mortal admixture and human nature gained ascendency. They be- came unseemly and lost those spiritual virtues which were the fairest of their precious gifts. It is the story of how man departed from the perfect pattern of his conduct, and in the end de- nied the very truths which were the foundations of his strength.

They gathered a vast army and attacked Europe from the sea, even going so far as to be- siege the Athenian States. And so they broke the law of the gods; for the twelve deities had so di- vided the earth that to each race and nation was given its proper part.

The world lost too all sense of its own unity: each man's hand was thereafter raised against his neighbor. The perfect state disap- peared under a deluge of politics; the priests of Poseidon gave way to the priesthood of Mammon. Plato's political vision was for the restoration of the Empire of the Golden Age. The old ways of the gods must be restored, he was convinced, if human beings are to be preserved from the corrup- tions which they have brought upon themselves. Plato sought this end when he established his uni- versity at Athens-the first school of formal educa- tion in history. Here men were taught the great truths of religion, philosophy, science, and politics, to restore to them the vision of the perfect State.

According to legend, when Solomon, King of Israel, resolved to build his temple according to the will of his father, David, he sent to Tyre and engaged the services of a cunning workman, Hiram Abiff, a master of the Dionysian Artificers. The members of this society held the exclusive right throughout the Greek states of designing the temples of the gods, the houses of government, the theaters of Dionysius and the buildings used for the public games. It is certain that the Dionysians practiced secret rites and worshipped the gods under geometric symbolism; and that they possessed a body of lore which included mathematical secrets of proportion and design, certain knowledge concerning univer- sal dynamics, and a philosophical, religious, moral and political conviction concerning the perfecting of human society.

As Grecian culture reached Rome, the Latins formed their own Dionysian soceity and named it the Collegia.

A man of vast learning, he was responsible for the superior sanitation of Rome and the great aqueducts which still border the Appian Way.

When even the Crusades failed to keep clear the roads of com- merce, it became ever more desirable to discover a western passage to the Orient. It was for this purpose that Columbus sailed, and not from an Italian or Spanish port, but from the Greek port of Mahon.

And this the only holiday which depends upon the day alone for its observance, and is peculiarly the American holiday which expresses thankfulness for freedom of religion, freedom of opportunity, and freedom of life. To summarize the opinions of Nostradamus con- cerning the future destiny of Western civilization is difficult, because of the involved idiom of the original text. But he points out clearly certain things that will happen. He saw that a great civi- lization would rise in the western world.

He said that America would have to fight several wars, including one with the Orient.

Fulfilling its destiny, Nostradamus foretold that America would become a great power in a pattern of world peace and would be looked up to by other nations for leadership against the common evils of the time. In short, as Nostradamus fore- tells the story of the Blessed Isles it is precisely ac- cording to the Platonic tradition; and we can not but wonder if he was a party to that tradition, and knew exactly whereof he spoke.

And they were bound together, in the secret society of unknown philosophers, moving the crowns of Europe as on a mighty chess board. Men of this calibre bring about the mutations of empire. It is the general opinion that revolutions begin with the common people, but this is not true; the benevolently in- formed always guide and direct public opinion. Through the centuries the prophesies of Nostra- damus have continued to exercise a !powerful force on the political destiny of the world. They have been translated into most of the languages of Europe; they were frequently quoted and reprinted during the period of the First World War; and in the Second World War both the Axis and the Allied powers have quoted Nostradamus variously to serve their purposes."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"98 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA It is in the larger picture of the world's future that Nostradamus indicates the coming of the great league, or assembly of world powers.

To be civilized, according to Cicero, is to reach that state of personal and collective be- havior in which men can live together harmonious- ly and constructively, united for the betterment of all.

In the Utopia, More presents his philosophical and political conviction in the form of a fable which sets forth the social state of man in a philo- sophic commonwealth. So completely has the world missed the entire point that More attempted to emphasize, that the very word \"Utopia\" has be- come a synonym for optimistic but impractical ideals of reform. Sir Thomas More was centuries in advance of his day, which was reason enough why he could not be appreciated. Together with the master, Plato, More belongs to ages yet unborn, to the time when men weary of study of the dilemmas which now they examine by what they think is practical, will turn to solutions which they now term impractical. An important Utopian was Tommaso Campen- ella, 1568-1639, an Italian philosopher also with strong Platonic leanings. Out of the wisdom of his years, Campenella composed the Civitas Solis, the city of the sun. In this work he departed from his usual interests-science, mathematics, and re- ligion-to apply the principles of natural philos- ophy to the problems of government. He regarded it as a major tragedy that men had reduced to a"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"THE DESIGN OF UTOPIAS 103 science practically every branch of learning except statesmanship, which continued to be left to the vagaries of incompetent politicians skilled only in the arts of avarice. Unfortunately, Campenella was not able to free his mind entirely from the pattern of his contem- porary world, so his ideals are confused and not entirely consistent. He viewed government as a kind of necessary evil to be endured until each man shall become self-governing in his own right. To the degree that the individual is incapable of the practice of the moral virtues, he must be sub- jected to the laws which protect him from himself and protect others from his unwise actions. The principal purpose of life then is to release oneself from the domination of government by the per- fection of personal character. Campenella envisioned the perfect State as a kind of communistic commonwealth in which men shared all the properties of the State, receiv- ing more or less according to the merit of each one's action. His theory that the State should con- trol propagation is a little difficult in application, but his advice that all men should receive military training as part of their education would meet present favor. Government officials, he insisted, should be elected by an examination to determine"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"104 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA knowledge and fitness, and promotion should be by merit alone and without political interference. This view is definitely Platonic, and leads natur- ally to Plato's conception of the philosopher-king as the proper ruler over his people. Campenella may have intended his City of th« Sun to be a philosophic vision of a proper world government, or may have been setting forth no more than the basis for a new constitution for the City of Naples, which at that time was looking forward to the estate of a free city. It is also said of Campenella that he lacked the beauty and ideal-, ism of the greater Platonists, and while this is probably true, his book is witness to the ills of his own time and a reminder to us that most of, the evils he pointed out remain uncorrected. In the year 1613, Trajano Boccalini, aged seventy- seven, was strangled to death in his bed by hired assassins. At least this is one account. We are informed by another historian that he died of colic. A third describes his demise as a result of being slugged with sand bags. Anyhow, he died. And it is believed that Trajano's end was due to a book which he published entitled, Ragguagli di Par- naso, a witty exposition of the foibles of his time.

Nearly every evil of modern government is in- cluded, ranging from protective tariffs to usury in private debt. The final conclusion reached by the committee is that the human problem is unsolvable except through a long process involving suffering and disaster. As an immediate remedy the best that could be done was to regulate the price of cabbages-which seemed to be the only article not defended by an adequate force of public opinion or a large enough lobby in places of power. Boccalini's satire is important because it consti- tuted the first published statement of the Society of the Rosicrucians. It points out that, first, evils must be recognized; then, the public must be edu- cated to assume its proper responsibility in the cor- rection of these evils; and lastly, public opinion must force the reformation of the State and curb the ambitions of politicians.

Johann Valentin Andreae, an early 17th Century German Lutheran theologian, was the next to cast his lot with the Utopians. Andreae's status is dif- ficult to define, but he is generally believed to be at least the editor of the great Rosicrucian Mtmifes- tos, and the author of the Chemical Marriage of Christian Rosencreutz, We may therefore safely assume that he was connected with one of the great orders of the Quest. Andreae's contribution to the Utopian literature is his Christianopolis, or the City of Christ. This work, which is almost unknown to English read- ers, is largely developed from the ideas of Plotinus. Christianopolis is Platonopolis, Christianized. Its author was a quiet scholar with a long white beard and a strict sense of Lutheran propriety. His Christianopolis is a monument of morality and good taste, but beneath his strict orthodoxy, Andreae was a man of broad vision. His city is governed by the wise and is enriched with all the arts and sciences; there is no poverty. The citizens are happy because each is performing his task motivated by an understanding of the dignity of human life. To my mind, it is dignity of values that makes Christianopolis a great book.

An- dreae tells us again and again, in the quaint word- ing of his old book, \"For lack of vision the people perish.\" It remained for the master of all fable, Sir Fran- cis Bacon, to bind together the vision of the Uto- pias with supreme artistry. It is a philosophical catastrophe that Bacon's New Atlantis was left un- finished. Or was it left unfinished? Rumor has it that the book was actually completed but was never published in full form because it told too much. The final sections of Bacon's fable are said to have revealed the entire pattern of the secret societies which had been working for thousands of years to achieve the ideal commonwealth in the political world.

It was only natural that he should envision the results should his in- ductive system be given Universal application. The New Atlantis was first published in 1627, as a kind of appendix to the Sylva Syloarum, a na- tural history in ten centuries. On the title page is a curious design. It shows the figure of an ancient creature representing Time drawing a fe- male figure from a dark cavern. The meaning is obvious: Through time, the hidden truth shall be revealed. This figure is one of the most famous of the seals or symbols of the Order of the Quest. Contained within it \"is the whole promise of the resurrection of man, and the restitution of the divine theology. The New Atlantis was not published during the recorded lifetime of Lord Bacon. It was issued the year following his death by His Lordship's chap- lain, William Rawley. This man was Bacon's close friend and familiar over a period of many years, and most of Bacon's papers were entrusted to Rawley's care. In. his admiration for Bacon's personal character and philosophical powers he left the expressed wish to be buried at his master's feet, and his wish was fulfilled.

The six days are the days of creation by which the natural world was brought into ex- istence, according to the account given in Gen- esis. As God created the Universe in six symbolic days, so man by art-that is, philosophy-must create the condition of his own perfection by means of six philosophical steps. The college is the secret school-the wise man's 'house' wherein are taught all arts and sciences, and not according to a materialistic interpretation, but according to a divine understanding of causes. Rawley stated that it had been His Lordship's intention to complete the fable of the New Atlan- tis with a second part, to contain the laws of the Ideal State, or commonwealth of the wise.

It may be for this reason that the writings were suppressed, for these crests and arms belonged to real persons who might have been subjected to persecution, as Sir Walter Raleigh was, if their association with the secret order had been openly announced.

Here the wise dwelt together in a gentle commonwealth of learn- ing.

The re- ligion consisted of a monotheism, that is, the wor- ship of one Supreme Principle abiding in the sun. Next to Deity, peculiar veneration was given to the Feathered Snake, who was regarded as a kind of Messiah, who suffered, died, and arose again. The legend of Quetza1coatl was thus in parallel with the myth of the dying God, very much as in Egypt, Chaldea, Greece,and as expressed by the early Christian Church. The Mayas were not a warlike people, and there is no support for popular belief that they were by nature cruel or barbaric. On the altars of their gods they offered only flowers and fruit; and it was not until the decline of the empire and its domination by less advanced tribes that human sacrifice was practiced, and then only on the rarest occasions. It is believed that the Mayas hold the world record for continued peace. They flourished as I great powerful nation for five hundred years with- out war with other tribes or internal strife.

The Mayan nation was a collective common- wealth living under aIL advanced form of social- ized order. They possessed all goods in common, and shared equally in the benefits of their produc- tion. They possessed no money or monetary sym- bol of any kind; and it has been suggested that this lack of currency was in part responsible for their five hundred years of peace. To them the wheel was the symbol of death, and they never developed any form of mechanized in- dustry. Each gave a part of his goods to maintain the State, and this contribution was employed to build public buildings, parks, schools, and places of public sport. There seems to have been no poverty, and little if any crime. No buildings have been found which suggest prisons or other places of confinement. The Mayas were hospitable, kindly, gentle, and industrious; their cities were beautiful in every way; they were public spirited, well governed, and ac- cording to the order of their time, highly educated.

They look upon each man's religion as his own particular belief, and if it suits his needs it de- serves the respect of all other right-minded men. Thus we see that the archetype for a generous and enlightened way of life is part of the American continent's common inheritance. It is well to note in passing that many of the simpler virtues practiced by the Mayas were shared by other tribes that inhabited North and South America. Although the North American Indians never achieved the high culture reached by the Mayas, all lived according to a democratic tradi- cion. The members of all tribes took care of their aged, provided for the widowed and the fatherless, and severely punished in the rare instances when some tribesman attempted to exploit another. Tribal government was invested in a council of the older and the wiser, and all matters relating to- the common good were submitted to them for arbitra- tion and solution. Crime was almost unknown. As most tribes were nomadic they had little oppor- tunity to develop inter-tribal points of view, and so there was considerable strife between tribes, but even in their warfare, North American Indians respected valor and developed chivalry to a marked degree.

And much has yet to be accomplished; we are still pioneering in the sphere of right thinking and right living. Bacon's secret society was set up in America be- fore the middle of the 17th Century. Bacon him- self had given up all hope of bringing his dream to fruition in his own country, and he concen- trated his attention upon rooting it in the new world. He made sure that the American colonists were thoroughly indoctrinated with the principles of religious tolerance, political democracy, and so- cial equality. Through carefully appointed repre- sentatives, the machinery of democracy was set up at least a hundred years before the period of the Revolutionary War. Bacon's secret society membership was not limited to England; it was most powerful in Ger- many, in France, and in the Netherlands, and most of the leaders of European thought were involved in the vast pattern of his purpose.

The Alchemists, Cabalists, Mystics, and Rosicrucians were the incisive instruments of Bacon's plan. Representatives of these groups mi- grated to the colonies at an early date and set up their organization in suitable places. One example will indicate the trend. About 1690, the German Pietist theologian, Magistar Johannes Kelpius, sailed for America with a group of followers all of whom practiced mystical and esoteric rites. The Pietists settled in Pennsylvania and their descendents still flourish in Lancaster county. Kelpius for some years lived as an An- chorite in a cave located in what is now Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. The Pietists brought with them the writings of the German mystic, Jacob Boehme, books on magic, astrology, alchemy, and the cabala. They had curious manuscripts illumin- ated with strange designs, and their principal text was called \"An ABC Book for Young Students Studying in the College of the Holy Ghost:' The Pietists brought the order of the Mustard Seed, and the Order of the Woman in the Wilderness to the new world. Kelpius was a man of feeble health and after a few years died from the hardships and exposures of his religious austerity.

Actually it did continue; but with the changing of the times it returned again to its secret foundations, disappearing entirely from the public view. The early years of the 18th Century brought with them many changes in the social and political life of the American colonies. By this time most of the Atlantic seaboard was dominated by the English. Cities had sprung up, important trade flourished with the mother country, and the' colo- nial atmosphere was in small counterpart that of the English countryside. By this time most of the important secret socie- ties of Europe were well represented in this country. The brotherhoods met in their rooms over inns and similar public buildings, practicing their an- cient rituals exactly according to the fashion in Europe and England. These American organiza- tions were branches under European sovereignty, with the members in the two hemispheres bound together with the strongest bonds of sympathy and understanding. The program that Bacon had out- lined was working out according to schedule. Quietly and industriously, America was being con- ditioned for its destniy-leadership in a free world."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"BACON'S SECRET SOCIETY COMES HERE 133 Any account of secret societies in America would have to include tribute to the man who has been called the \"First American Gentleman\"-Benjamin Franklin. Although Dr. Franklin was never the country's President, nor a military general, he stands out as one of the most important figures in the struggle for American independence. Quiet, dignified, scholarly and gentle, Franklin foresaw a new goal for an ever changing world through the square bi-focal glasses of which he was the in- ventor. Historians have never ceased to wonder at the enormous psychological influence which Franklin exercised in colonial politics. But up to the pres- ent day, few indeed are those who have realized that the source of his power lay in the secret so-- cieties to which he belonged and of which he was the appointed spokesman.

Little information is available concerning Sir William Hope; but from the text of his prediction it appears that he was devoted to the study of astrology, and based his strange prophetic poem upon an interpretation of the starry influences. There is also a hint of the Cabala in the manner used by Hope to indicate the men referred to in his prediction.

One. thing is certain, Robert Allen Campbell has concluded his treatise with a curiously meaningful passage from the writings of the man responsible for the broad program of colonization in the west- ern world that made possible the creation of the United States of America. The selection of Ba- con's words to conclude the book may be accident, and it may be intent; but in the light of the text and the air of mystery which covers the history of the writing and the life of the author, it appears more than possible that intent is the answer. Chapter 2 of Our Flag is entitled, \"The Colonial Flag\" This in substance is what it says: In the fall of 1775, the Colonial Congress in ses- sion at Philadelphia appointed Messers. Franklin, Lynch, and Harrison as a committee to consider and recommend a design for a Colonial Flag. Gen- eral Washington was then in camp at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Committee went there to consult with him. While at Cambridge the committee men were entertained by a patriotic and well-to-do citizen. At that time the best room in this gentleman's residence was temporarily occupied by a peculiar old gentleman. As there was only one other guest"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"150 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA room, Messrs.

Nothing is known about the mysterious old man except that he was referred to as the \"Professor\"; his name is not preserved. He was beyond seventy years of age but apparently in the prime of his life. He ate no flesh, fish, nor fowl, or any green things, and drank no liquor, wine, or ale. His diet con- sisted of cereals, well ripened fruit, nuts, tea, and such sweets as honey and molasses. He was well educated, highly cultured, of extensive as well as varied information, and very studious. He spent most of his time pondering over rare books and ancient manuscripts, which he seemed to be de- ciphering, translating, or rewriting. These he kept carefully locked up in a heavy iron-bound chest and never showed them to any person. He was liberal but in no ways lavish with his money, but was well supplied with all that he needed. The Professor was a staunch advocate of demo- cracy and his favorite statement was, \"We demand no more than our just due; we will accept and be satisfied with nothing less than we demand.\" On the eve of their arrival, December 13, the committee men dined with their host and hostess,"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"AN UNKNOWN DESIGNED OUR FLAG 151 also General Washington and the Professor. The Professor was introduced to the visitors without his name being given, and his ease, grace, and dignity during the introduction is especially noted. When Benjamin Franklin was presented, he stepped forward and extended his hand, which the Pro- fessor heartily accepted. As their eyes met there was an instantaneous, a very apparent, and a mutually gratified recognition. After dinner, Washington and the committee men exchanged a few words in undertone, and then Dr. Franklin arose, saying, in substance, \"As the Chairman of this committee, speaking for my associates, and with their consent, and with the approval of General Washington, I respectfully in- vite the Professor to meet with the committee as one of its members; and we, each one, personally and urgently, request him to accept the responsibil- ity, and to give us, and the American Colonies, the benefit of his presence and his counsel.\" After graciously accepting the invitation, the Professor made his first recommendation. He pointed out that the Committee now consisted of six persons, General Washington and the host be- ing honorary members. Six was not an auspicious number, and as none of the members could be spared, let the hostess be included so that the num-"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"152 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA ber could be increased to seven. This suggestion was unanimously accepted and the hostess became the secretary of the committee. The committee met the following evening in the Professor's room. General Washington opened the proceedings by asking Dr. Franklin for his recom- mendations. Franklin replied by requesting that the entire committee listen to the words of his new found and abundantly honored friend, the Professor, who had definite suggestions to make. After a preamble, the Professor made the follow- ing extraordinary remarks: \"The sun of our political air, like the sun in the heavens, is very low in the horizon-just now ap- proaching the winter solstice, which it will reach very soon. But, as the sun rises from his grave in Capricorn, mounts toward his resurrection in Aries, and passes onward and upward to his glorious cul- mination in Cancer, so will our political sun rise and continue to increase in power, in light, and in glory; and the exalted sun of summer will not have gained his full strength of heat and power in the starry Lion until our Colonial Sun will be, in its glorious exaltation, demanding a place in the governmental firmaments alongside of, coordinate with, and in no wise subordinate to, any other sun of any other nation upon earth.\""},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"AN UNKNOWN DESIGNED OUR FLAG 153 The Professor went on to point out that the flag which he recommended would be subject to change in the future as the national destiny increased. This change, however, should not require a com- plete re-designing but a process of gradual modifi- cation: \"To make it announce and represent the new nation which is already gestating in the womb of time; and which will come to birth-and that not prematurely, but fully developed and ready for the change into independent life-before the sun in its next summer's strength ripens our next harvest.\" The design finally submitted consisted of a field of thirteen alternate red and white stripes, and in the area which now contains the stars was the British Union Jack. The area containing the Union Jack was the one suitable for modification. The design was formally and unanimously ac- cepted, and the flag was adopted by General Wash- ington as the recognized standard of the Colonial Army and Navy. There is no record of any report being made by this committee to Congress.

The references in the Declaration of Independence to \"the Laws of Nature\" and \"Nature's God\" es- pecially reflect Paine's theological convictions.

He sought refuge in France. Almost immediately he became involved in the French Revolution as a staunch supporter of the revolutionary party. He boldly advocated the per- petual banishment of Louis XVI, but was opposed to the execution of the king.

Paine's escape from death in France was by one of those unforeseen circumstances which so often have changed the course of history. Robespierre fell from power. His successors restored Paine to his seat in 'the revolutionary convention. When things in France had settled down to the sober process of setting up a permanent govern- ment, Paine turned his attention to George Wash- ington, whom he bitterly attacked, thus losing much of his popularity in America. Paine returned to the United States in 1802 and his closing years were comparatively uneventful. He died in 1809. Ten years later his body was sent back to England to be re-interred in his na- tive earth. Thomas Paine was a free thinker, a radical pam- phleter. It was his misfortune to be \"born out of time.\" Yet by his very birth and the energy of his nature he helped to change the face of time.

In the Age of Reason, Paine emphasized the ne- cessity of separating the spheres of Church and State, looking at both institutions in their prac- tical state of corruption rather than in their ideal state of mutual integrity. He held a broad view of religion in general, believing that all faiths were naturally good and were necessary to the spiritual security of humanity. Such broadness was out of season, and it made him numerous enemies among those holding fanatical convic'tions. It was dangerous to preach religious tolerance in his day, when the spirit of persecution was still strong. When the clergy involved itself in the political conspiracies of the State and descended to the level of self-interest, their spiritual power was prosti- tuted; and, said Paine, they lost all claim upon public respect. Paine saw the conniving, plotting, and counter plotting of religious leaders who had cast their lot with the aristocracy against long suf- fering and exploited citizens. With a Church such as this he had no patience, and he had the elo- quence and abundant courage to express his con- victions regardless of the cost.

A government compounded from a dissolute nobility and fawning professional office holders, ever cater- ing to the longer purse, brought Paine's righteous indignation to the boiling point, indignation which he could apply in words understandable to the masses. It was his simple reasoning that such a Church, plus such a State, equalled chaos. It was bad enough for government to burden the people with extravagances, but it was still worse for the Church to preach that men should accept this load as coming from God, to see it designed to purify their souls by the practice of patience and humility. It was not enough for Paine to believe that all men were created free and equal; these free men had the inalienable right of representative government; and the further right to improve themselves to the enjoyment of all natural good. He was more of a perfectionist than was prac- tical in his own day or even in our time.

He called men to a high destiny, and men under- stood in part and applied in part, but lacked the capacity for a full and understanding acceptance. This probably explains Paine's bitter attack on George Washington. Paine had been present when the American government was formed, and he must have been at least a witness to the bickerings which went on during those most critical years. As a president, Washington was not universally popular; it was only after considerable engineer- ing that his election had been accomplished. Al- most immediately the new government fell into political difficulty. Self-seeking politicians appeared on the scene at the very beginning, just as they have never since been absent from the picture. Paine, seeing some of the noblest ideals of the new State perverted and misinterpreted, dared to speak when discretion held the tongues of other men. In Paine's own ·public career, made up largely of reverses, he chose to accept all forms of personal humiliation rather than modify any of his atti- tudes.

In reconstructing the scene, it is well to remem- ber that if the Revolutionary War failed every man who had signed the parchment then lying on the table would be subject to the penalty of death for high treason.

He mentions the all-seeing eye of God which was afterwards to appear on the reverse of the Great Seal of the new nation. In all, there is much to indicate that the unknown speaker was one of the agents of the secret Order, guarding and directing the destiny of America. Some time ago, an eastern publisher suggested to me that an interesting and important title for a book would be, \"The History of Unknown Men.\" This publisher was a great reader of history; and it was his observation that nearly all great causes are furthered by mysterious and obscure persons who receive little or no credit for the part which they have played. To write the history of these men would be to write the history of the Order of the Quest, the story of the unknown philosophers. Some, like Francis Bacon, come to high estate; but most of the unknowns work obscurely through other men, who gain the credit and the fame. In an old book of rules used by the brothers of the secret orders, is the following: \"Our brothers shall wear the dress and practice the customs of those nations to which they travel so that they"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"172 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA shall not be conspicuous or convey any appearance that is different or unusual.

And similarly, another is the unknown speaker whose words removed indecision about signing the Declaration of Independence; it is not known who he was, and the incident is preserved only in a rare old book, the very existence of which it is dif- ficult to prove. It is reasonably conceivable that in secrecy and anonymity well ordered aid has been given to the struggle for human equity and justice that has been America's destiny through the past into our present time. It is our duty and our privilege to contribute what we can to this Universal plan.

These are described by Gaillard Hunt, in The History of the Seal of the United States, published in Washington, D. C., in 1909. Most of the designs originally submitted had the Phoenix bird on its nest of flames as the central motif. One of the designs now familiar to us was finally selected, and Benjamin Franklin was asked for his opinion of the choice. Franklin gave his immediate approval, observing naively that it was very appropriate to select the wild turkey as the symbol of the new country: The turkey was a bird of admirable quality, hard working and industrious, and of good moral char- acter, and a fowl also with a marked adversion for the color red, at that time unpopular among the colonists. 175"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"176 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA When it was explained to Franklin that the bird on the seal was intended to represent an eagle he was bitterly disappointed; and he insisted that the drawing did not look like an eagle to him, and furthermore, an eagle was a bird of prey with few of the respectable qualities of the wild turkey. It has been said that the designer had drawn a Phoenix. Its selection would of course have been appropriate. Among the ancients a fabulous bird called the Phoenix is described by early writers such as Cle- ment, Herodotus, and Pliny; in size and shape it resembled the eagle, but with certain differences. The body of the Phoenix is one covered with glossy purple feathers, and the plumes in its tail are alter- nately blue and red. The head of the bird is light in color, and about its neck is a circlet of golden plumage. At the back of its head the Phoenix has a crest of feathers of brilliant color. Only one of these birds was supposed to live at a time, with its home in the distant parts of Arabia, in a nest of frankincense and myrrh. The Phoenix, it was said, lives for 500 years, and at its death its body opens and the new born Phoenix emerges. Because of this symbolism, the Phoenix is generally regarded as representing immortality and resurrection."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"SYMBOLS OF OUR NATION'S GREAT SEAL 177 All symbols have their origin in something tan- gible, and the Phoenix is one sign of the secret orders of the ancient world and of the initiate of those orders, for it was common to refer to one who had been accepted into the temples as a man twice-born, or re-born. Wisdom confers a new life, and those who become wise are born again. The Phoenix symbol is important in another way, as an emblem among nearly all civilized na- tions of royalty, power, superiority, and immor- tality. The Phoenix of China is identical in mean- ing with the Phoenix of Egypt; and the Phoenix of the Greeks is the same as the Thunder Bird of the American Indians. In the accompanying drawing, the head of the bird as it appeared on the great seal of 1782 is compared with the present form. It is immedi- ately evident that the bird on the original seal is not an eagle, nor even a wild turkey as Franklin had hoped, but the Phoenix, the ancient symbol of human aspiration toward Universal good. The beak is of a different shape, the neck is much longer, and the small tuft of hair at the back of the head leaves no doubt as to the artist's intention.

Here is represented the great pyramid of Gizah, composed of 13 rows of masonry, showing 72 stones. The pyramid is without a cap stone, and above its upper platform floats a triangle contain- ing the All-Seeing Eye surrounded by rays of light. This design was not pleasing to Professor Charles Eliot Norton, of Harvard; he summed up his dis- pleasure in the following words. \"The device adopted by Congress is practically incapable of ef- fective treatment; it can hardly (however artistic- ally treated by the designer) look otherwise than as a dull emblem of a Masonic Fraternity.\" The quotation is from The History -o] the Seal of the United States. If incapable of artistic treatment, the great seal is susceptible of profound interpretation. The Pyra- mid of Gizah was believed by the ancient Egyp- tians to be the shrine tomb of the god Hermes, or Thot, the personification of Universal Wisdom. No trace has ever been found of the cap of the great pyramid. A flat platform about thirty feet square gives no indication that this part of the structure was ever otherwise finished; and this is appropriate, as the Pyramid represents human so- ciety itself, imperfect and incomplete.

The tri- angle itself is in the shape of the Greek letter D, the Delta, the first letter of the name of God-the divine part of nature completing the works of men. The 72 stones are the 72 arrangements of the Tetragrammaton, or the four-lettered name of God, in Hebrew. These four letters can be combined in 72 combinations, resulting in what is called the Shemhamforesh, which represents, in turn, the laws, powers, and energies of Nature by which the perfection of man is achieved. The Pyramid then is the Universal house, and above its unfinish~d apex is the radiant emblem of the Great Architect of the Universe. There is a legend that in the lost Atlantis stood a great university in which originated most of the arts and sciences of the present race. The Univer- sity was in the form of an immense pyramid with many galleries and corridors, and on the top was an observatory for the study of the stars.

The obverse of the great seal has been used by the Department of State since 1782, but the reverse was not cut at that time because it was regarded as a symbol of a secret society and not the proper device for a sovereign State. Quite rare are discov- eries of the use of this symbol in any important form until recent years. Most American citizens learned for the first time what was the design on the reverse of their seal when it appeared on the dollar bill, series of 1935A. So far as anyone may know, the use of the seal in 1935 was probably without premeditation or special implication. But it is interesting that its appearance should coincide with great changes af- fecting democracy in all parts of the world. As early as 1935 the long shadows of a world tyranny had extended themselves across the surface of the globe. Democracy was on the threshold of its most severe testing.

There is nothing about the early strug- gles of the colonists to suggest such a selection to farmers, shopkeepers, and country gentlemen. There is only one possible origin for these symbols, and that is the secret societies which came to this country 150 years before the Revolutionary War. Most of the patriots who achieved American inde- pendence belonged to these societies, and derived their inspiration, courage, and high purpose from the ancient teaching. There can be no question that the great seal was directly inspired by these orders of the human Quest, and that it set forth the purpose for this nation as that purpose was seen and known to the Founding Fathers. The monogram of the new Atlantis reveals this continent as set apart for the accomplishment of the great work-here is to arise the pyramid of human aspiration, the school of the secret sciences. Over this nation rules the supreme king, the Ever Living God. This nation is dedicated to the ful- fillment of the Divine Will.

At two o'clock of the third night after General McClellan's arrival at Washington, D. C., to take command of the United States Army, he was working over his maps and studying the reports of scouts. A feeling of intense weariness came over him, and leaning his forehead on his folded arm he fell asleep at his table. He had not been sleeping more than ten minutes when it seemed that the locked door of his room was suddenly thrown open, and someone strode up to him and in a voice terrible with power spoke: \"General McClellan, do you sleep at your post? Rouse you, or ere it can be prevented, the foe will be in Washington.\" The General then describes- in some detail his strange feeling.

The table"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THE DREAM OF GENERAL MCCLELLAN 185 covered with maps was still before him, but the furniture, the walls of the room, and other familiar objects were no longer visible. Instead, he was gazing upon a living map including the entire area of the country from the Mississippi river to the Atlantic ocean. McClellan tried to see the features of the being that stood with him, but could discern nothing but a vapor having the general outline of a man. As he looked upon the great map, McClellan was amazed to see the movements of the various troops and regiments, and a complete pattern of the enemy's lines and distribution of forces. The General was immediately infused with a great elation, for he felt that the movements on this extraordinary map would enable him to bring the war to a speedy and victorious termination. Then his elation changed to great apprehen- sion, he saw the enemy's forces moving to certain points which he himself had intended to occupy within the next few days. He quietly realized that in some way his plans were known to the enemy. Then again the voice spoke. \"General McClel- lan, you have been betrayed.

When this had been done, McClellan became aware that the figure standing near him had in- creased in light and glory until it shone like the noonday sun. And as he raised his eyes he looked into the face of George Washington. The first President with sublime and gentle dign- ity looked upon the bewildered officer, and spoke as' follows: \"General McClellan, while yet in the flesh I beheld the birth of the American Republic. It was indeed a hard and bloody one, but God's blessing was upon the nation and, therefore, through this, her first great struggle for existence, He sustained her and with His mighty hand brought her out triumphantly. A century has not passed since then, and yet the child Republic has taken her position of peer with nations whose pages of history extend for ages into the past.

He was again in his room with his maps spread out on the table before him."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"188 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA But there was one difference; the maps were covered with the marks, signs, and figures which he had inscribed there during the vision. McClellan walked about the room to convince himself that he was really awake. He then re- turned and looked at the maps. The markings were still there. Convinced now that the experience was heaven sent, McClellan had his horse saddled and rode from camp to camp making the necessary changes in his strategy to meet the enemy's planned offen- sive, His moves were successful, and he prevented the capture of the city of Washington. At that time the Confederate Army was so close that Abraham Lincoln, sitting in his study at the White House, could hear the rumble of the Confederate artillery. General McClellan concludes his account of the strange vision that saved the Union with these words: \"Our beloved, glorious Washington shall again rest quietly, sweetly in his tomb, until per~ haps the end of the Prophetic Century approaches that is to bring the Republic to a third and final struggle, when he may once more, laying aside the crements of Mount Vernon, become a Messenger of Succor and Peace from the Great Ruler, who has all the Nations of the Earth in his keeping."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"THE DREAM OF GENERAL MCCLELLAN 189 \"But the future is too vast for our comprehen- sion; we are the children of the present.

The democratic common- wealth can never be legis- lated into existence. Nor can it result from for- mal treaties or conferences. This is clearly indi- cated in the tragedy of the League of Nations. The League failed to prevent war because the na- tions which composed the League lacked the cour- age of high conviction; they failed the very institu- tion which they themselves had established. Permanent progress results from education, and not from legislation. The true purpose of educa- tion is to inform the mind in basic truths concern- ing conduct and the consequences of conduct. Education is not merely the fitting of the individu- al for the problems of economic survival. This is only the lesser part of learning. 193"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"194 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA The greater part deals with the intangibles of right motivation and right use. No human being who is moved to action through wrong motiva- tions, or misuses the privileges of his times, can be regarded as educated, regardless of the amount of formal schooling he has received. The human mind is established in knowledge not alone by the reading of books or the study of arts and sciences, but by the examples set up by leaders and the personal experiences of living. According to the Baconian system, there are three sources of learning. The first is tradition, which may be derived from books. The second is obser- vation, by which we learn from the actions of each other. And the third is by experimentation, which is a study of causes and consequences brought about by personal conduct. The supreme human purpose is the perfection of man. This must come first, and when this end has been achieved all good things will inevitably follow. Only enlightened men can sustain enlightened leadership; only the wise can recognize and re- ward wisdom.

The Greek law giver, Solon, declared that in the ideal State laws are few and simple, because they have been derived from certainties. In the corrupt State, laws are many and confused, because they have been derived from uncertainties. These corrupt laws are like the web of a spider which catches small insects but permits the stronger crea- tures to break through and escape. Where there are many laws there is much law- lessness, and men come to despise and ridicule the restraints that are imposed upon freedom of action. Corrupt laws, resulting from efforts to amend in- adequate legislation by further inadequate legisla- tion, reveal a general ignorance of right and wrong. Where such ignorance exists the ideal function of democracy is impossible, and liberty degenerates into license. The half-truth is the most dangerous form of lie, because it can be defended in part by incontestable logic. Wherever the body of learning is broken up, the fragments become partial truths. We live in a day of partial truths; and until we remedy the condition we must suffer the inevitable conse- quences of division."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"196 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA According to the Ancients, religion, philosophy, and science are the three parts of essential learning. Not one of these parts is capable if separated from the rest, of assuring the security of the human state. A government based upon one or even two of these parts must ultimately degenerate into a tyranny, either of men or of opinion. Religion is the spiritual part of ler rning, philo- sophy the mental part, and the sciences, including the arts and crafts, the physical part. As man him- self has a spiritual, mental, and physical nature, and all of these natures manifest in his daily liv- ing, he must become equally informed in all the parts of his nature if he is to be self governing. \"Unbalanced forces perish in the void,\" declared a prophet of old; and this is true beyond possibility of dispute. The Platonic commonwealth had as its true foundation the unity of learning. In the midst of the philosophic empire stands the school of the three-fold truth. Religion is the quest of truth by means of the mystical powers latent in the con- sciousness of man. Philosophy is the quest for truth by the extension of the intellectual powers toward the substance of reality.

These three, then, are the orders of the Quest. Together they can bring about the perfection of man through the discovery of the Plan for man. One of the great secrets of antiquity was this realization of the unity of knowledge and the iden- tity of the Quest in all the branches of learning. The great philosophers of the past were trul y great because they approached the problem of life as priest-philosopher-scientist. The title \"The Wise\" is properly applied only to those in whose con- sciousness the unity of knowledge has been es- tablished as the pattern of the Quest. It was part of the ancient plan that has des- cended to us to build again the ideal university- the college of the six days work. Here would be taught the same arts and sciences that we teach to- day, but from a different basic premise. Here men would learn that the sciences are as sacred as the theologies, and the philosophies are as practical as the crafts and trades. Those mystical extra-sensory perceptions viewed with suspicion by the material- ist would then be developed according to the dis- ciplines of the sciences, and all learning would be consecrated to the supreme end that men become as the gods, knowing good and evil."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"198 THE SECRET DESTINY OF AMERICA This university is the beginning of democratic empire. No longer would it be a secret school- the House of the Unkown Philosophers. It would emerge from the clouds which have concealed it from the profane for thousands of years and take its rightful place as the center and fountain-head of the Ever Living Good. When humanity willfully ignores the Universal laws which govern its destiny, Nature has devious ways of pressing home its lessons. Civilization after civilization has been built up by human cour- age and destroyed by human ignorance. We stand again on the threshold of a great decision. Once more the workings of time have revealed the weaknesses of our social structure. Once more we have come to a day of reckoning. In the postwar world one of two courses lies before us. Either we will make the old mistakes again, and try to force our own concepts upon the Universe; or we will gather our strength for one heroic effort to put things right. 1£ we make the old mistakes we will be rewarded by the old pain.

Centuries ago, one of the secret masters of the Quest wrote: \"The Eternal Good reveals its will and pleasure through the body of Nature and the motions of Universal Law. Within the body of Nature and Law there is a soul which must be discovered by great thoughtfulness. And within that soul of Nature and Law there is a spirit which must be sought with great understanding; for verily I say unto you, my brothers, that it is this spirit concealed from the profane but revealed to the thoughtful, which giveth life.\" This, then, is the design of our foundations: that men shall abide together in peace and shall de- vote their energies to the common cause of dis- covery. Man is greater than the animal, not in strength of body, nor in shrewdness, nor in the power of his senses, nor even in skill and patience; man is superior because he contains within himself the faculties and powers by which he can perceive his true place in a divine order of life.
