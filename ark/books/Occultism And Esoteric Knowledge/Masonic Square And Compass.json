The controversy and the challenge ar e answered in the book. The quest began at York University, Ontario, Canada, when an Orthodox Jewish friend of mine was investigating Messianic Judaism. Our intellectual conversation covered many topics whic h included the so-called Star of David, which he said he did not use as the symbol G-d really gave the children of Israel was the seven-branched Menorah. Being a journalist, he challenged me to explore the si x-pointed star. And I accepted the challenge, with the plan that I would prove its Jewishness. After all, I wore one and felt I had to defend it, even to him. That was the summer of 1979 and the re search took me four years to complete. I found a few Jews who knew it was not Jewish, and these are mentioned in the book. Others did no t think about it, and most did not care whether it was orignially occult or not - they did not think it mattered. I checked Jewish sources and all their encyclopaedias attested that it was not originally Jewish and was not used as the symbol for any of the twelve tribes of Israel. Jewish sources said it wasn't originally Jewish. So, what was it? That took four years of research . From archive to archive, library to library...history book to history book. The first mention of the star was in Amos 5:26 regarding the trek from Egypt to Canaan. Then in 922 B.C., when Solomon married the daughter of Pharoah and went into magic and witchcraft and built an altar to Ashtoroth and Moloch . The book traces the six pointed star from Egypt to Solomon, to Arab Magic and Witchcraft , to Druid use(references are documented). The book traces the star through Freemasonry usage to Mayer Amschel Bauer, who, in the 17th century, chan ged his name to depict the red six- pointed star (or shield) which he had hung on his door in Germany, and thus began the family of \"Red Shield\" or Rothschild. The research carried on through this family, to their court of arms, to Cabala , to Astrology , to Hitler and his putting a yellow six-po inted star on all Jews during the holocaust, to the Zionist symbol, and finally to the flag of the State of Israel and beyond. Because this symbol is comprised of a six within a six within a six (6 points, 6 triangles, 6 sides of the hexa gon in the middle) the research also included a look at the 666 prophecies in the Book of Daniel etc., regarding the \"wilful King\" (anti-Christ) and th e \"mark of the beast\". The Scriptural significance of the numb er seven and a Biblical description of the real Messiah and the seven-bran ched Candlestick (Menorah) which God gave to the children of Israel as an everlasting covenant (which is also mentioned in the New Testament) is covered. All the sources are written at the bottom of each page making it easy for readers to see and check for themselves. I started out to defend this symb ol, but ended up shocked and quite devasted with the evidence gleaned fr om the academic research.
