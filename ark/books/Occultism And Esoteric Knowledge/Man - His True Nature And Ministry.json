Som e account of Saint-Martin (Le Philosophe inconnu) and his writings has been given in the p reface to his ‘Correspondence w ith Baron Liebesto rf’, recen tly pub lished ∗ ; and it is necessary hero only to say that the bo ok of which a trans lation is now presented to the reader, ‘Le Min istère de l’Homm e-Esprit’ , was probably the last, as it ce rtainly was the m ost im portant, of his works. It was published in Pari s, in 1802: he died the following year. Saint-Martin wrote to his friend the B aron : (L et. cx. of the ab ove ‘Correspondence' ) : \"The only initiation which I preach and seek with all the ardour of m y soul is that by which we may enter into the heart of God, a nd m ake God' s heart enter into us, there to form an i ndissoluble marriage, which will m ake us the friend, brot her, and spouse of our Divine Redeem er [‘ the violen t tak e it by force :' Matt. xi. 12.]. There is no other m ystery, to arrive at this holy initiation, than to go m ore and m ore into the depths of our being, and not let go till we can bring forth the living, v ivif ying root, b ecause th en all th e fruit we ought to b ear, according to our kind, will be produced within us and without us n aturally ; as we see is th e case with earth ly trees, because they are adh erent to their own r oots, and incessantly draw in thei r sap. \" T hese few words suffice to show the scope, intent, or spirit, and point to the modus operandi, of all Saint-M artin 's works, and of none more truly so than of the work before us. In allusion to the above-nam ed recently publis hed ‘Correspo ndence of Saint-Martin ’, a learn ed frien d (who will doubtless b e the in terp reter of a num erous class of readers) said to the Editor : \"W e are on unsafe ground when we leav e th e old p aths of received truth for th ose of mysticism ”. – But, without controversy, m ay it not be asked : Received by whom ? And which are those old paths of “received tr uths”? And are they anywhere visible or recognizable? Have they not been everywhere overgrown with vegeta tion? And have not as m any paths been m ade through this vegetation, and in as m any different directions, as there ha ve been Essayists and Dogm atizers – especially in our own country – of late years? And as a ll these paths have been virtually authorized as lawful highways, do they not form a legal labyrinth, out of which no exit is found? Let the read er therefore see if Saint- Martin cann ot help h im out of the dif ficulty: and let him not be repelled by the word m ystic; the office of such mystics as Saint-Ma rtin is to go to th e bottom of mystery, and lead m ysticism captive, by laying open the essential, fundam ental laws of things, and showing their connect ion with their Root, which is God. No doubt when m en's minds, looking upon things, as we are all natura lly inclined to do, in their outw ard and visible aspect alone, c onside r tha t the ir reality lies in their materiality , – not in the ir immater ial essen ces; in the ta ngible f orm or letter, – n ot in th e spir it of things – it is h ard for such m inds to realize that they them selves are the m en who have b een looking at shadows,   ∗ CORRESP ONDE NCE bet ween LOUIS CLAU DE de SA IN T-MARTIN an d KI RCHBERGER, Baro n d e LIEBESTO RF.

Edward B. Pen ny and not at realities. Yet this truth has been a ffirmed from all antiquity down to the present tim e, by authorities which they are com pelled to resp ect. In the present day, when, as we have seen, the old way has been com pletely overgrown, and we are enclosed in a labyrin th, it would seem particularly opportune that our attention should be called to Nature’s landm arks along the way of our regeneration, which cannot m islead us; and that we should be led to dig through the overgrowth of spontaneous vegetation, and plant our feet on the original pavem ent, laid by God' s own hand, all the way from matter, through spirit, to God Hi mself, from whom we derive. Of course, these landm arks can be seen by the traveller only as he proceeds on his journey, and the pavem ent can be cleared and tro d upon only by advancin g on it; and no fireside traveller can know practica lly anything of either one or the other, any m ore than he can know such things in earth ly travel:- therefore all m en are invited to gird them selves for the journey, and GO and SEE for them selves. It is certain that no good thing is ever ac quired without trouble; and, on this journey, much patient endurance is called for. Earthly voyages of discovery ar e attended with m ore hardships than m ost other enterpri ses. In spiritual voyages it is the sam e: and they are or m ay be of two kinds; either of discovery only, or of conquest and settlem ent, besides. If they are of discovery only, that is, m erely intellectual, the la bours, fatigues, and calls for self-denial will be of the sam e order; the m ental powers m ust leave the fleshpots am ongst which they have been at ease. This sort of voyage m ay be of the greatest use to f uture settlers, but, except for fa me, is of sm all advantage to the discoverers them selves. Books, as Saint-Ma rtin says, give the m eans of this intellectual voyage only; and the way, even through Saint- Martin' s books, is hard enough, – not only from the nature of the regions they penetrate, but because he was less careful in expressing him self than perhaps he m ight have b een: he thought m ore of the m atter than of the manner; m ore of the m oral conques t, and settlem ent in those regi ons, than of the construction of his sentences, or the lines of his m ap. The intend ing settler, whose m oral and affectional pow ers are those which leave the flesh-pots, and travel out of Egypt, and who has to find his own resources for his exp edition, will be thankful for this m ap as it is; and, looking at it s use and in tention, he w ill ov erlook its faults of construction. To lighten the journey f or the reader, a nd break its m onotony, in som e degree, the Translator has taken it upon him self to place sign posts on the way, in the shape of headings of subjects as they com e before the read er: – these w ere not in th e orig inal. In parts of the work there is an app arent redund ancy of illus tration, which the Edito r would willin gly have cu rtailed ; bu t, as such part s are nearly always found to cover o r lead to som ething original, little could be done in this way. He has, moreove r, felt it his duty to keep as closely as possible to the text, and to rende r in the sim plest language at his comm and.    -    3    -"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

Pen ny THE SPIRITUAL MINISTRY OF MAN or The Ministry of the Spirit-Man FIRST P ART - On Natur e Man, not outward nature, the true witness of Divinity The hum an understanding, by applying itself so ex clusively to outward things, of which it cannot even yet give a satisfact ory account, knows less of the natu re of Man' s own being even than of the v isible objects around him ; yet, the mom ent m an ceases to look at the true character of his intim ate essen ce, h e becom es quite b lind to the eternal Divine Source from which he descends: for, if Man, brought back to his prim itive elem ents, is the only true witness and positiv e sign by which th is suprem e Universal S ource m ay be known, that source m ust necessarily be effaced, when the only m irror th at can represent it to our m inds, disappears. Then, when praiseworthy writers and well-m ean ing defenders of trut h try to prove that there is a God, and deduce from His existence all its necessary consequences, as they no longer find this hum an soul sufficiently in harm ony to serv e as a witness, they go back to Nature, and to speculation taken from the ex ternal order. Hence, m any excelle nt spirits in m odern times have made use of all the resources of logic, and put every external s cience und er contribution in their endeavours firm ly to establis h the existence of Divinity; and yet, notwithstanding these num erous testim onies, never was atheism m ore in fashion. It m ust surely be to the glory of our speci es, and show the great wisdom of Providence, that all the proofs taken in the orde r of this world are so defective. For, if this world could have truly shown the Divinity, God woul d have been satisfied with that witness, and have had no need to create M an. In fact, Man was created m erely because the whole unive rse, notwith standing all the grandeurs it displays to our eyes, neve r could m anifest the riches of Divinity. A far different effect is produced by those gr eat writers who, in m aintaining the existence of God, take Man him self for their proof and the basis of their demonstrat ions: Man as he should be, at least, if not as he is . Their ev idences acqu ire force and f ulness and s atisf y all our facultie s at once.

That which is taken from the nature of Man, on the contrary, even when it obtains a com plete victory over th e unbeliever, causes him no humiliation , because it places h im in a position to feel and partake of all the dignity which bel ongs to his quality as Man. And one who is not vanquished by this s ublim e evidence m ight, at m ost, deride it som etimes; but, at other tim es, he would very likel y be sorry not to be able to reach so high a ground, and would certainly never take offence at its being of fered to him ; and this is enough to show how carefully we ought to sound the depths of Man' s being, and affirm the sublim ity of his essence, that we m ay thereby dem onstrate th e Di vine Essence, for there is nothing else in the world that can do it, directly. .........I repeat, that, to attain th is end, every argum ent taken from this world and nature, is unsatisfactory, unstable. We suppose things for th e world, to arrive at a fixed Being, in whom every thing is true; we lend to th e wo rld abs tract and figurative ve rities, to prove a Being who is altogether real and positive; we take things witho ut intellig ence, to prove a Being who is Intellig ence itself; thing s without lov e, to dem onstrate Him who is only L ove; th ings circum scribed within lim its, to m ake known Him who is Free; and things that die, to explain Him who is Life. Is it no t to b e feared, that, in comm itting ours elves to such an undertak ing as this, we m ay im bibe the very defects which are inherent in the m eans we use, instead of de monstrating to our opponents the treasures of Hi m we wish to honour? Two worlds, outward and inwar d From the for egoing, we s hall s ee a lig ht arise, which m ay at first seem strange, but it will not be the less real: it is, that, if m an (who, be it rem embered, is not of this world) is a sure and direct m eans of de monstration of the Divine Esse nce; if proof s taken from the external order of this world are defective and in complete; and if the hypotheses a nd abstract truths, which we im pute to this world, are taken from the m etaphysi cal order, and have no existence in nature; it clearly follo ws, that we com prehe nd nothing in the world we are in, but by the light of the world in which we are not; tha t it is m uch easier to a ttain to the light and cer tain ty which shin e in the world in which we are not, than to naturali ze ours elves with th e sh adows and darkness which envelope the world we are in; in s hort, since it m ust be said, that we are m uch neare r to what we call the oth er-world than we are to th is. It will not even be very difficult to acknowle dge, that, to call the ot her world the world in which we are not, is an abuse, and that th is world is the o ther world to us.

Such is the case with the two worlds in ques tion ; and I leav e it to the reader to com pare the light and certainties we find in the m etaphysical order, or wh at we call the other world, with the obscurities, approxim ations, and uncertainties we find in the one we inhabit; and I also leave it to him to pronounce whether the world we are not in has not som e right to priority over that we are in, as well on account of the perf ections and sc ience it affords us, as of the superior antiquity it seem s to have over this world of a day in which we are im prisoned. For none but slaves of ignorance and hast y judgments could think of m aking m ind descend fro m m atter, an d, therefore, what we call the other world, from this; whilst this, on the contrary, seem s to derive from the other, and com e after it. Thus then, if the world w here we are not, th e one we call the other world, has, in all respec ts, th e prior ity ove r this, it is tr uly this world, the one where we are, which is the other world, since it has a term of comparison before it, of which it is the difference; and what we call the other world, being one, or the first, c arries with it all its re lations, and can be a m odel only, and not another world. This also shows how m uch the Spirit-Man m ust be out of his line of descent, im prisoned in thes e m aterial elem ents, and how far these m aterial elem ents, or th is world, is from sufficing to show the Divinity : more over, str ictly sp eakin g, we never do go out of the other world, or the Spirit-W orld, though so few people believe in its ex istence. We cannot doubt this truth, since, to give value to the proofs we dr aw from m atter, or this worl d, we are obliged to lend it the qualities of m ind, or the other world. The reason is, every thing depends upon Spirit, every thing corresponds with Spirit, as we shall see in the sequel Thus, the only difference between m en is, th at som e are in the other world, knowing it, and the oth ers are there without kno wing it; and, on this head , there is th e following progress ion.

But, not only do they not feel its sweet infl uences, nor enjoy the rest and refreshm ent which even this apparent world affords to man, but they know the other world only by the endless suffering which the acrid source they have opened causes them . If m an, through negligen ce, allows th em to enjoy a m oment's resp ite, it is only for a tim e, and they have always to restore their ill- gotten goods a hundredfold. What idea, then, should we for m of this Nature , or this universe, which m akes us so blind to that other world, that spirit ual world,-be it good or evil,-wh ich we are never out of ? The answer is b rief. Without the evil spiritual world, nature would be an eternity of regularity and perfection; without the good spiritual world, nature would be an eternity of abom ination and disorder. It is Suprem e Love or W isdom, who, to assuage the f alse eternity, has thought right to oppose a ray of the true eternity to it. The m ixture of these two eternities com poses time, which is neither one nor the o ther, and yet offers an im age successive ly of both, in good and evil, day and night, life and death, etc. Suprem e Love could em ploy for this work, powers only which descended from the true eternity, for this reason, on the one hand, everything in tim e is measured, and, on the other, tim e itself, both g eneral and p articular, m ust neces sarily pass away. But, as the true eternity has, so to speak, co me out of itself to cont ain the false, and the false eternity, on the contrary, has been thereby forced to draw b ack; this is the reason why we find it so dif ficult, in tim e, to dis ting uish thes e two eternities, neither of which is here in its place ; and th is is the r eas on why it is so dif ficult to prove God by nature, in which all is frag- mentary and m ixed, and in which the two eterni ties show them selves only under the outward veil of corruptible m atter. Man buries himself in the external world In the s tate of apathy into which m an si nks, th rough his daily illus ions, and studying only the external order of Nature, he can s ee neither th e source of her apparent regularity, nor that of her diso rder s; he id entif ies him self with th is ex ternal Universe; he cannot help taking it for a world, and even an exclusive and self-existing one. And, in this state of thin gs, the id ea which has th e m ost diffic ulty of access into m an, is that of the degradation of our species, and the fall of Nature herself; he has lost the rights he ought to have had over her, by allowing them to fall into disuse, and ended by confounding this    -    21    -"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

Yet if he would, for a mom ent, take a m ore correct and profitable view of the external order, a simple rem ark would suffice to show him, at once, the positive degradation of his species, the dignity of his being, and its superiority over this external order. How can m en deny the degradation of their spec ies, when they see-th at th ey can neith er exist, nor live, nor think, nor act , but by com bating a resistance? Our blood has to defend itself from the resistance of the elem ents; our m inds, fr om that of doubt, and the darkness of ignorance; our hearts, from false inclinations; ou r whole bodies, from inertia; our social state, from disorder, etc. A resistance is an obstacle; an ob stacle, in th e order of spirit, is an antipathy, an enm ity; and an enm ity in action is a hostile com batant power: now this power, continually extending its forces around us, holds us in a violent and pain ful situation, in which we ought not to be, and, without which, this pow er would be unknown to us, as if it existed not, si nce we inwardly feel that we were m ade for peace and quiet. No! Man is not in his proper proportions; he has evidently undergone a change for the worse. I do not say th is of hi m because I find it in books; it is not because this idea is generally entertain ed am ongst all people; it is because m an, ev erywhere, seeks a p lace of rest for his sp irit; it is b ecause he wants to m aster all k nowledge, even that of the infinite, and although it escapes him continually, he had rather di stort it, and m ake it bend to su it his dark conceptions, than do without it; it is because, during hi s transien t existence on earth, he appears to be in the m idst of his fellow -creatures, like a ravenous lion am ongst sheep, or like a sheep amongst ravenous lions; it is b ecause, am ongst that vast num ber of m en, th ere is h ardly one who awakes for any thing but to be either the victim or the executioner of his brother. Man's titles higher than Nature Nevertheless, Man is a great be ing; if he were not, how c ould he be degraded? But, independently of this proof of the form er dign ity of our being, the follow ing reflection ought to convince us of our superior ity over Nature, even now. Astral earthly Nature works out the laws of creation, and came into existence by virtue of those laws only. The vegetable and m ineral kingdom s have in them the effect of these law s, for they contain all the elem entary, astral, an d other es sen tial prope rties; and tha t with m ore efficacy, and in grea ter d evelopm ent, than the s tars them selves, which contain only one-half of these properties, or than the earth, which contains the other half. The anim al kingdom ha s the use of these laws of creation, since anim als have to feed, maintain, and reproduce them selves; and they cont ain all the p rinciples wh ich are necessary for this. But the Spirit-Man has, at onc e, the ef fect, the use, and the free direction or m anipulation of - 22 -"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

This exam ple is: First, a corn-f ield, which ha s in it th e ef fect of these law s of Nature; Secondly, a granivorous anim al, having the use of this corn, and m ay eat it; Thirdly, a baker, who has the control and m anipulati on of the corn, and can m ake bread of it; which, though in a very m aterial m anner, shows that the powers of Nature are possesse d but partially by the crea tures wh ich cons titu te it ; but, th at the Spirit -Man alone, and in him self, em braces them all. As for those m aterial rights which man po ssesses, and which we have summed up above, in the m anipulations of the baker, if we rise in thought to Man' s true region, we shall, no doubt, find these rights prov ed m ore virtually, and on a grander scale, by sounding the wonderful properties which constitute the Spirit-Ma n, and exploring the high order of m anipulations which these properties m ay lead to. If Man has the power to be the workm an a nd handicraftsm an of earthly productions, w hy should he not be the same of a superior order? He ought to be able to compare those divine productions with their S ource, as he has the pow er to com pare the total eff ect of Nature with the Cause that f ashioned and guides her, and he alone has this privilege. But experience alone can give an idea of this sublim e right or privilege; and, even then, this id ea will ever appear to be new, ev en to him who is m ost accus tom ed to it. But, alas! Man knows his spir itual rights, and he does not enjoy them ! What need is there of any other proof of his depriv ation, theref ore, of his degradation? Man may recover his titles O, Man! Open, then, your eyes for an inst ant; for, with your rash judgm ents, you will not only never recover your rights, bu t you run the risk of annihila ting them . You m ight take a lesson from the physical order: anim als are all heart; and it is clear that, though they are not machines, they are witho ut m ind ( esprit ), for this is distinct from them , outside. For this reason, they have no alliance to establish, as we have , between them selves and their principle; but, seeing the regularity of their m arch, it cannot, to m an's sha me, be denied. that, taken altogether, these creatures, which are not endowed with free dom , m anife st a m ore complete and constant alliance with their prin ciple than we can form in ourselves, with our own. W e m ight, even go so far as to say, that a ll c reature s, ex cept m an, m anifest th em selves as so m any hearts, of which God is the m ind or spir it. In fact, the world, or lost m an, woul d be all m ind ( esprit ), and thinks he can do without his true heart, his sacred divine heart, if he can but protrude hi s anim al heart, and his vainglory.

Sentiment of immortality By striving to becom e again God' s images, we obtain the inestim able advantage, not only of putting an end to our privati on and degradation, but of adva ncing towards what m en, greedy for glory, call imm ortality, and actually enjoying it; for, the vague desire which m en of the stream have, of living in the m inds of others, is th e weakest an d m ost false of all the arg uments commonly advanced in f avour of the dignity of the hum an soul. In fact, although Man is spirit, and, in all his actions, orderly or othe rwise, he always has a spiritual motive of some kind; and although, in whatever em anates from hi m, he can work only by and for spirit; yet the desire of this kind of immortality is only an im pulse of self-love, a sentim ent of present sup erior ity over others, and a foretaste of their adm iration which he prom ises to him self, and which warm s hi m; and when he does not see his way to realise this pictu re, his zeal coo ls, and the work s wh ich dep ended on it are affected accord ingly. And we m ay af firm that this inc lina tion com es rather of a wish for immortality, than of any real conviction about it; and the proof is, that those who i ndulge in it, are those who, to realize it, have nothing but tem poral works to offer, showing that th e ground they go upon is within the lim it of ti me: for the tree is known by its fruit. If they were really convinced of this immo rtality, they would pr ove their conviction by trying to work in and for the true God, forgettin g them selves; and their ho pes of immortal life would not be disappo inted, because they would s ow their seed in a field where they would be sure to find it again; whereas, by working only in tim e, and sowing only in m en's m inds, to be soon forgotten by som e, and never heard of by othe rs, is to go to work m ost awkwardly and disadvantageously, in building for immortality. If we would reflect a lit tle, we should find, close at hand, decisive proofs of our immortality. Only consider the ha bitual, constant dearth in which man leaves his spirit, – and his spirit is not extinguished. He excites him self, he goes wrong, he gives him self up to error, he becom es wi cked, he turns m ad, – he does evil when he would do good; but, properly speaking, he does not die. If we treated our bodies with the same carele ssness and neglect, if we left them fasting and starved in a sim ilar way, they would do ne ither good nor evil, they would sim ply die.

When he is fortunate enough to perceive, if onl y for a m oment, that he is w alking in this grave, then he has an irresistible spiritual pr oof of his immortality, since he has that of his frightful m ortality, and even of what we figurativ ely call his d eat h. Now, how could he feel a horror of this spiritual mortalit y, if he had not, at the sam e tim e, a strong sentim ent of his im - mortality? It is only in this contrast that he finds that he is punished; just as physical pain is felt, by the opposition of disorder to health. But this kind of proof c an be got only by experience, and it is one of the first-fruits of regeneration; for, if we do not feel our sp iritual death, how can we think of calling for life? The father of lies Here, again, we also learn that there must be another and a still m ore unhappy being, – the prince of falsehood, – since, without him , we could not have had the idea of him ; seeing that all things can be revealed only by them selves, as we have shown in “L’Esprit des Choses”. Not only does this b eing continua lly walk in his grave, not only does he never perceive that lie is wa lking in that grave, – f or this be could not do without a ray of light to help him , – but, when we approach that grave, we perceive th at be is in continual dissolution and corruption; that is, tha t he is in the p erpetu al pro of and se ntim ent of his death; that he never conceives the sm allest hope of being delivered from it, and thus his greatest torm ent is the sentim ent of his immortality.    -    25    -"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

T his m ystery of divine and spiritual things ought, then, to be allowed to penetrate to the very ground of our being, otherwise this double m ystery, which connects us with divine things, and divine things with us, would fail of its effect. But there is a great differen ce between these two sorts of mysteries. The mystery of Nature m ay be m ore or less known, but Nature it self hardly touches our essential fundam ental being at all; and, if we experience pleasure in its contem plati on and in penetrating its mysteries, it is b ecause we then rise above Natu re, and as cend, by its m eans, to regions which are really analogous to ourselves; it is here in like a lantern, showing us the way to these high regions, but unable, in itself, to co mmunicate th eir sweetnes s. The spiritual and divine things, on the c ontrary, touch our faculties of love and adm iration far m ore than our understanding; it seem s even as though it were to prepare us for a still higher m easure of a dmiration, that they will not so readily yield them selves to our percep- tions ; for if we could, at will, subject them to our cognizance, we should not adm ire th em so much, and our pleasure would be less: for, if it is true that ou r hap piness is to adm ire, it is also true that to adm ire is to feel , rather than to know; which is th e reason why God and Spirit are at once so sweet and so little known. For the oppo site reason, we m ight say that Natu re is so co ld because it is m ore adapted to be known than to be felt; thus the plans of W isdom are so arranged, that things, on which our true p leasu re depends, d o not so yie ld to our in tellig ence as to quench ad miration; an d things which are intended less for the nour ishm ent of our adm iration, i.e. our true pleasures, as having less analogy to us, afford us a sort of com pensation in the pleasure s of the understanding.

For the door by which God goes out of Hi mself, is the sam e by which He enters the human soul.

This is the reason why the learned, who do not take all these routes, never enter Nature. Matter had no door by which to go out of itself, nor enter any region in ferior to itself ; this is the reason why the enem y could have no a ccess to any orderly regi on, whether m aterial or spiritua l. Instead of watching carefully at his post, Man not only opened all these doors to his enem ies, but he closed th em against him self, so that he now finds him self outside, and the robbers within. Can a m ore lam entable situation be conceived? Man the mirror of God's wonders We see why the superb titles which constitu ted M an so priv ileged a being, would have made his m inistry in the univers e of so m uch im portance; he m ight have m ade known the Divine Threefold Unity, our likeness to which has been so often remarked, showing thereby that we should not thus have been His im age, if we had not the right of representing Him . And everything, even to the angels, was greatly in terested in m an's keeping the post which was comm itted to him . In fact, as anim al life, sca ttered all through nature , knows neither the spir it of the universe in itself, nor the germ s of the vegetables, which are its resu lts, and the sens ible exp ress ion of its properties, and anim als know these things only in the flavour of what they feed upon ; so do the angels only know the Father in the S on. They know hi m neither in Him self nor in Nature, which, especially since the first great change, is much nearer to the Father than to the Son, through the concentration it experienced; and they can know Hi m only in the divine splendour of the Son, who, in His turn, has His im age only in the heart of Man, and not in Nature. For this reason, Man, who, in the beginning of the Universe, w as related, principally, to the Son, the Source of Universal developm ent, kne w the Father, both in the Son and in Nature. And, for this reason, Angels seek so much the so ciety of Man, believing that he is still in condition to show them the Father in Nature. Key to the wonders of Nature Our task, therefore, since the epoch when Ada m was drawn out of the precipice into which he fell, should be to disc over, by all possible m eans, the w onders of the Father, m anifested in visib le Nature; and th is it is the m ore possi ble for us to do, because the Son, who contains them and opens them all, restored them to us, by incorporating our first parents in the m aterial for m we now bear, and brought the key with Him, when He m ade Hi mself like us. - 40 -"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

Now, power to judge supposes power to instruct. Yes, angels m ay be stewards, physic ians, redressers of wrong, wa rriors, judges, governors, protectors, &c., but, without us, th ey cannot gain any profound knowledge of the divine wonders of Nature. What prevents this is, not only that they know the Father only in the splendour of the Son, and that, unlike the first m an, their bodily co vering is devoid of essences taken from the root of Nature, but also because we close for th em the central eye with in us, the div ine organ, by which they m ight have had the m eans of contempla ting the riches of the Fa ther in the depths of Nature; and that is why m en of God ought to instruct angels, and open to their eyes the depths which are hidden in the corporificati on of Nature, and in all its wonders. This also is the reason w hy, in sciences and letters, those m en are ranked highest who discover the grand laws of Nature; and, in re ligion, those who have been clothed with the greatest pow er from the Spirit. Since our degradation, this precious privileg e of penetrating the depths of Nature, and becom ing, so to say, possessors of them , has been, in part, restored to us; it ought even to be an inheritance, inherent in Man' s nature, inasm uch as it constitu tes his tru e riches and o riginal property: of this we have several in stances in the patr iarch al testam ents.

The World is dead O Man! The evil is greater still! Say not now that the Universe is on a bed of suffering; say it is on its death-bed ; and it is for you to perfor m its funereal rites. It is for you to reconcile it with the pure source from which it descends; a source which, though not God, is one of the eternal organs of His power, and from which the Un iverse ought never to have been separate; it is, I say, for you to reconcile it, by purging it fr om all the substances of falsehood with which it has been incessantly im pregnated ever since the fall, and by washing it from the consequences of passing every day of its life in vanity. The Universe would not thus have passed its days in vanity, if you had yourself rem ained in that throne of glory in which you were originally seat ed, and if you had anointed it daily w ith an oil of gladness which should have pr eserved it from sickness and pain; you w ould then have done for it what it now does for you, by providing you daily with the light and elem entary productions to which you have subjected yourself, and which are now necessary for your existence.

When he once descended to this low er regi on, the enem y found it easy to inspire him with am bitious thoughts, which he would not othe rwise have had-with non e to speak to him of objects of ambition, of which he knew nothing.

Thereby, our desire form s but one with the di vine desire, or hunger for the m anifestation of truth, and its rule in the world. Thereby, our understanding form s but one with the Divine Eye, which sees behind as well as before. Thereby, our bodies, allowing all the substanc es of lies, corruption, and pollution with which they are con stitu ted to die ou t, feel thei r places tak en by diaphanous substances, which render them like transparencies of Divine Light and wonders th roughout, as natural bodies are transparencies of natural wonders: this is what they who believe that th is life-substance is no barren substance, m ay hope for. And if they believe that it is no barren substan ce, this is what they will have to go through if they would recover their first estate and fulfil their destination. How should this life-sub stance b e barren ?

On e is for the use of our spiritualized intents and labours, which ought to be our daily diet, wit hout restriction to tim es or hours, or kinds of alim ent, for our labours them selves will determ ine these. The other is f or active w ork, when it thinks f it to take us into its \" serv ice; it th en serv es at once for our guide and for our support. What I have said of the first degree of this regim en m ay be said of every other act of our tem poral life: we ought never to apply ourselves to anything, without having first awakened within us the divine hunger; because as this divine hunger has to procure for us the true substance of life, we ought to have no aim , no attraction, no thought, but never to allow this fountain of the divine w onders to pass from us, but, on the contrary, em ploy ourselves incessantly in reviving it, that it m ay have the sw eet delight of satiating itself with the Substance of Life. Pains of new birth I shall not surprise you, by here telling you, O ma n, that this life-subs tance is to be found only in pain s of bitter an guish, and a sense of pro found and com plete des olation, for our own faults and privations, and those of our fellow-cr eatures; for th e real wr etchedness of those who suffer, and, still m ore, of those who do not suffer; for the sepulchral state of Nature, and the chronic and acute pains of the universal W orld, seeking to restore, through us, equilibrium and plenitude everywhe re; whilst we, by the m ode of being we have, through crim e, created for ourselves , keep the Heart of God Hi mself, in us, on its death-bed, and in a grave of corruption. Now, why is desolation, thus, the generative source of the Substance of L ife? It is because, for us, now, it is the onl y generative sou rce of speech ( la parole ), the W ord; as we see in our sicknesses, our suffer ings extort cries, and our cries bring assistance and relief. For this reason, the m an who is called to the W ork has no need to rem ove from his place; the disease and the rem edy are everywhere, and he has nothing to do but cry. It is not an earthly, but a spiritu al change of place, that can serve us. And, without stirring fro m our m aterial p lace, we ought to reflect incessan tly, painfully, on the cold, dark, spiritual place we are in, that we may go and make our dwelling in one that is warm er, lighter, and happier. Cause of Nature's groans When we observe th at th e Universe is deprived of speech, it is not hard to see tha t th is is a principal cause of its distress.

It is, then, this privat ion, which is the real cause that Natu re is in that perpetual distress, by wise m en called vanity. Those m en knew that sp eech, the W ord, should fill all things, and they groaned becau se there was som ething in which it was not heard. They knew that the Univ erse, withou t the Word, and em pty, signified nothing to them, since God alone was full, and signified all things ; so that, whatsoever does not partake of the plenitude of His divine B eing, can show onl y the reverse of His universal properties. They knew that m an could not pray without preparation, that is, unless his atm osphere were f illed with the W ord; or, in the widest sens e, unless sp eech were r estored to the universe. And they complained in their sorrow, and in man's nam e they said: “This u niverse, this beautiful picture, which we shoul d adm ire with transport, were we blind to all it wants ; this universe is s peechless, it can take no part in prayer ; it is even an obstacle to it, for we can only pray with our brethren. Alas, then! We shall pr ay at our ease only when the universe has passed away! and we are ob lige d to wait til l the end of all things, to give free cou rse to th e ard our which burns us! Who could endure such grief as this ?” And their days were passed in agony! O Man! Since you are in the wo rld, there is not one of its storm s which you m ay not feel and share in, since your body particip ates in the divers influences and temperatures of which the elem ents are at once the m edium and the source. Yes, since you were able to cause the pains of the universe, you are susceptible of feeling them ; and, only in proportion as you are allowed to partake of its pains, can you contribute to the developm ent of its faculties: only by move ments coincident with its sufferings, can you succeed in restoring its joys, and hope for free dom to be imparted to your prayer. You will, in deed, one day, have to en ter into the s torm s of the Spirit, and o f God, and the Word, both individually and unive rsally; for the rights of your being call you to act co- ordinately, in both these regions ; and then, your new birth wi ll advance, and the W ork be enlarged for you.

In fact, Natu re is like a d umb creature, e xpressing, as well as it can, by its m ove ments, the wants w hich devour it m ost, but which, from wa nt of speech, it canno t express as it desires; and this gives a tone of sadness and seriousne ss to its happiness, and prevents us from com pletely enjoying our own. And, in the m idst of these grand scenes, we re ally feel that N ature is weary of being unable to speak; and our adm iration gives way to a languor approaching to m elancholy, when we give ourselves up to this painful reflection. This should suffice to make us understand th at everything ought to speak; and the conviction that everything ought to speak, brings this conviction als o, that everything ought to be diaphanous and fluid, and that opa city and stagnation are the radi cal causes of the silence and weariness of Nature. Nature a prison for Man What sort of dwelling, then, is this, for you, O Man, am idst all these objects which can manifest neither joy nor speech ? An d do you not s ee what th e term of that im perious want of speech and joy you feel yourself m ust be, and w hat awaits y ou when you are delivered out of this prison of Nature, as well as what sort of office you have to fulfil in the wo rld, if you still think of being its comforter?

But, though Nature be condem ned to weariness and silence, observe th at it speaks louder by day than by night; this is a truth w hich you can easily verify, and your intelligence will show the reason; it will show you that the Sun is the v erb of Nature , that when its presence is withdrawn, Nature no longer enjoys th e use of her faculties; but, wh en it r eturns to res tore he r to life by its fiery word, Nature redoubles her effo rts to bring forth all that is in her.

Edward B. Pen ny Instead of profoundly investigating these f oundations, m en have allowed their thoughts to be lost in idle questions, whic h, while they lead them away from the paths they ought to have followed, can teach them nothing. Su ch, for in stance, is that p uerile question about the divisibility of m atter, which keep s the schools as in their infancy. It is not m atter which is infinitely divisible; it is its ground of action, or, in other words, the spirituous powers of what m ay be called the material or astral sp irit. These powers are innum erable. The m ome nt they are required to tran sform the mselves into sensible characters and figures, the substance is not wanting, for they ar e im pregnated with it, and produce it, in concert with the e lementary power, with which they un ite. Hence it is, that eve ry thing that ex ists here be low, crea tes f or itse lf the sub stance of its own body. Now the m icroscopic minuteness of som e bodi es, anim alcule for instance, should not surprise us, though they be so perfectly orga nized, after their kind. All bodies are but a realization of the plan of the astral Spirit, a dded to the individual sp irituous operation of each body; and, here, we should bear in m ind this im por tant truth, nam ely, that, as Spirit has no know- ledge of space, but only degrees of intensity in its radical virtues, there is not a single spirituous power of Spirit, which, whether m ateria lly s ensible or no t, is not so according to the hidden elem ent, or that higher corpor ification m entioned before, under the nam e of Eternal N ature. Birth of m atter The passage from this, to the m aterial re gion, takes place only by the m ost extrem e concentration and attenuation of that spirituous power of Spir it, over which the elem entary power has rights, to help it to form its body or covering. This elem entary power has com plete authority in its own region, and ex ercises it with an universal em pire over every spirituous basis that is pre sented to it: th ey unite on ly in the ir m inim um, which, here, is inversely, on e being th e minimum of attenuation, the othe r the m inimum of growth or developm ent. The spirituous basis, in its turn, effects a living reac tion on the elem entary power; so that, in proportion as this basis develops itself, the elementary power is also devel oped to overtake it, as is seen in the growth of trees and anim als. When, by this m eans, this basis has acquired strength enough to free itself from the dom inion of the ele mentary power, it separa tes f rom it; as is s een in a ll blossom s, sm ells, and colours; in short, in the ripe ning of any production. They all abandon their m atrices when these can no longer retain them, and then the m atrices return to their m inimum again, not to say annihilation, because they have no lo nger any spirituous b ases to excite th eir re-action. Matter is indivisible Thus, in the first place, m atter is not infinite ly divisible, cons ider ed in res pect to its substance, the division of which, as we have shown elsewhere, we cannot even attem pt, as we - 55 -"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns. Edward B. Pen ny see organic bodies cannot be divi ded, without their perishing ; – secondly, it is not inf initely divisib le in its particu lar action s, for each of th ese actions ceases, as s oon as the sp iritu ous basis which serves for its subject is withdrawn; the retr eat and disappearance of this basis puts an end to this actio n. As for this infinite divisibility, considered ab stractedly, it is s till le ss poss ible, f or it is nothing but our own conception wh ich serves as basis for a p retend ed m atter, which we continually f orge; and as long as our m ind affords such a substratum or germ , m atter appropriates it in our thought, a nd gives it form and covering. Thus, as long as we stop at this divisibilit y, or think of its tem poral results, we find it possible and real, s ince a sensible f orm always f ollows the b asis we of fer it; bu t, as so on as we turn our m inds away from this centre of action, which we approach only intellectually, this form disappears, and there is no longe r any divisibility in m atter. Matter, a portrait or picture If the learned of all tim es, from the Platos and Aristotles, to the Newtons and Spinosas, had but rem arked that matter was only a represen tation or im age of what was not itself, they would not have tortured them selves, nor er red so much, in telling us what it was. Matter is like a portrait of an absent person; we must absolutely know the original, in order to know whether it is like; otherwise, to us, it will be but a fancy work, on which one m ay make what conjectures he likes, without bei ng sure that any one of them is correct. Magism of Nature Nevertheless, in this series of for mation of things, there is an important po int which will not yield to our cognizance; that is, the Magism of the generati on of things, and this refuses itself only becaus e we seek b y analys is, what can be apprehended only by a secret im pression; and even here, w e m ay say, that Jacob B oehm e has raised the veil, by opening to our m inds the seven for ms of Nature, even to the eternal root of all. The true character of Magism is, to be the medium and m eans of passage, from a state of absolute dispersion or indifference, which Boehm e calls abyssal, to a state of sensibility, in any order, spiritual or natura l, sim ple or elem entary. Generation, or this passage from the insensible to the sensible state, is perpetual. It holds the m iddle place between the disp ers ed insens ible st ate of things, and their state of ch aracterized sensibility, and yet is neither of them , since it is not dispersion, like the abyssal state, nor developed m anifestation, like the thing which this generation transm its and communicates to us. In this sense, Nature has its Magism ; for it contains all that is a bove it in dispersion, or all the as tral and elem entary essen ces which have to contribute to the production of things; and it    -    56    -"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns. Edward B. Pen ny contains, besides, all the hidden properties of the higher world, towards which it ev er tends to direct our thoughts. In this sense, each particular produ ction of Nature has also its Magism ; for each in particula r, say a f lower, a salt, an anim al, a m etallic subs tanc e, is a m edium between the invisible, insensible pr operties which are in its root, its principle of life, or its fundam ental essences, and the sensible quali ties which em anate from this production, and are m ade m anifest by its m eans. In this m edium , all that has to com e forth in every production, is elaborated and prepared. Now this place of preparation, th is laboratory, into which we ca nnot penetrate without destroying it, is, for this very reason, a true Magism fo r us, although we m ay know a ll the springs which concur in its production, and even the law that directs the effect. Ground of the regeneration of Nature The principle of this hidden process is founde d in the Divine generation itself, in which the eternal medium for ever serves as passage to the infinite imm ensity of universal essences. In this passage, these universal essences are resp ectively im pregnated, that, after this im pregnation, they m ay be m anifested in their living ardour, wi th all their individual qu alities, and those they have communicated to each other during their abode in this m edium , or thei r passage through it. Now, without this m edium , this place of passage, there would be nothing m anifest, nothing apprehensible to us; thus, all the m edium s of Nature as it is, and all the m ediums of spiritua l Nature, ar e only im ages of this prim itive and ete rnal m edium ; they only repe at its law; and, in this way, every thing there is in tim e is the dem onstrator, the comm entator, and the continuer of eternity. Eternity the ground, created things the manifestation For, Eternity, or what is, s hould be considered as the ground of all things. C reatures are only like fram es, vases, or active coverings, in which this true a nd living Essence en closes its elf, in order to m anifest itself by their m eans. Som e, such as those which com pose the univers e, m anifest the spir ituous powers of this highest Essence. Others, such as Man, m anifest its spir itua l es sences, th at is, what is m ost intim ate in this one Essence, this Being of beings. Thus, though we m ay be ignorant of the genera tion of things, yet all knowledge towards which we tend, and of which we avail ourselves when we obtain it, has true Essence f or its ground and object: thus, the beauties of Nature, and the useful and gentle properties, which, since God arrested its fall, are still to be found in it, notwithstanding its degradation, also belong to this true Essen ce, and m ay still serve for its organ, fram e-work, and conductor.    -    57    -"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

Man, Nat ure's physician, mu st know her constitution Let us repeat then, supposing it true that the universe were on its death-bed, how should we bring it relief, if we were i gnorant, not only of what constitu tes the u niverse in its elf, but even of the relations which its different parts, and wh eels within wh eels, form ing the whole m achine, and regulating its m ovem ents, m ust have with each other?

In fact, the philosophers of antiquity give us ve ry little help on this subject. It is a sm all thing f or the m to say, with Thales, th at the un iver se owes its o rigin to wate r; or, with Anaxim enes, that it owes it to ai r; or, with Em pedocles, that it is com posed of four elem ents continually at war am ongst them selves, without ever being able to destroy each other: – supposing, of course, we m ay judge these doctrines in the absence of whatever dem onstrations may have justif ied them to their authors and partisans.

Thus, notwithstanding K epler' s brilliant di scoveries of laws of heavenly bodies; Descartes, who was so celebrated for having app lied algebra to geom etry, sought still to discover the cause and the m ode of their m ovem ents. While Kepler dem onstrated, Descartes endeavoured to explain: so great is the attraction of m an's m ind towards the knowledge, not only of the course of the stars, and the laws, and duration of their periodical m ove ments, but ev en of the m echanic al cause of these m ovem ents; yet this led that fine genius into those unfortunate system s wh ich people have rejected, without hitherto sub stitu ting any thing else for them .

But he tries, in his turn (p. 301), to ascend to their true cause; m odestly, however, and with wi se hesitation, – offering us som ething which is not the result of obser vation and calculation. His idea of this \"true c ause\" is reduce d to this , that, for the planets to have received their circular m ovem ent, all in one direction, round the Sun, an immense fluid must have surrounded that Orb, like an atm osphere ; and he pretends th at this solar atm osphere at first extended beyond the orb its of all the plan ets, and grad ually con tracted to its p resent lim its. He pretends that the great eccen tricity of the or bits of com ets leads to the sam e result, and evidently indicates the disappearance of a great num ber of less excentri c orbits; which supposes an atm osphere round the sun, extending beyond th e perihelion of all known com ets, and which, destroying the m ove ments of those which traverse d it during its great ex tension, re-united them to the sun. Then, says he, it is clear that only thos e com ets which were beyond that atmosphere during that period, can exist at present; that as we can observe only those which approach the sun in their perihelion, their orbits m ust be very excentric; but that, at the sam e tim e, their inclinations must be as unequal as if these bodies had been shot forth at h azard, s ince the solar atm osphere did not influence their m ovem ents; that thus, the long duration of com etary revolutions, the great eccentricity of their orbits, and the vari ety of their in clina tions, a re naturally explained by m ean s of this atm osphere. But, he then asks, how did this atm osphere determ ine the m ovem ents of r evolution and rotation, in the planets? He answ ers: that if these bodies had pe netrated into this fluid, its resistance would have made them fall upon the sun; that we m ay therefore conjecture that they were f orm ed at succ essiv e lim its of this atm osphere, by the condensation of its zones, which it had to abandon, in the plane of its equator, in cooling and condensi ng . . . that the satellites m ay be supposed to have been for med in like m anner, by the planetary atm osphe res; finally, that the five phenomena which he had spoken of follow na turally from these hypotheses, to which the rings of Saturn contribute additional probability. Let us exam ine these tw o hypotheses. That of Buffon, besides the defects rem arked by the learned L aplace, offers a still g reater difficulty, nam ely, how we are to know from whence that com et came, which is supposed to have struck the sun, and broken the m atter of the pl anets from it, inasm uch as planets and com ets would appear to have had originally a great am ity in their movem ents. In fact, if these two orders of celestial bodies differ in their excentric ity, in their directions, and in their inclinati ons, they res emble each o ther in their sub jection to the sam e laws of weight and attraction, of proportion as to sp eed and distances, and eq uality of areas ran - 60 -"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

In tru th, it is hard to con ceive how th e solar atm osphere, whic h perm itted the plane ts to be for med, only by contracting itself to its pr esent lim its, – and, doubtless, our com ets in like manner, – as it withdrew, since it originally extended beyond the pe rihelion of all known com ets, and since, according to him , th e great excen tricity of their o rbits leads to the sam e res ults; it cannot be co nceived, I say, how the solar atm osphere, which, accord ing to his hypoth esis, extended beyond the perihelion of all known come ts, has, nevertheless, been traversed, throughout its great extent, by a gr eat num ber of less excentric or bs, the move ments of which it destroyed, and which it reunited wi th the sun, since the existence and form ation of these less excentric orbs or com ets, in the bosom of this atmosphere, would contra dict h is whole system . It cannot be conceived, why, if comets could penetrate into th is solar atmosphere, planets, considering their little excentricity, should not have penetrat ed thither, there to be destroyed likewise; there circulating, even exclusively, till, in their turn, they were precipitated upon the solar m ass; since both, according to his hypothesis, owe their origin to the sam e cause; from which would result, that, for a long tim e past, we ought to have had no more planets, inasm uch as it is said (p. 301) that this imm ensely exte nded fluid m ust have em braced all bod ies, i.e. planets and sate llites. Finally, it cannot be conceived, if the planets owe their form ation only to the retreat or shrinking of the solar atmosphere, how the sate llites shou ld o we thei rs to the retreat or shrinking of that of their planetary principals, since these satellites which are supposed to be of exactly the sam e nature as their principals, m ust owe thei r origin to a simultaneous cause, and the solar atm osphere, in retiring or shrinking, is supposed to leave no atmosphere at all behind it.

Another observation which supports this, and is no less true, is that the laws of external results ar e more easy to c atch th an tha t of the orga ns by which these r esults are transm itted; and that the law of these organs is m ore easy to fi nd, than that of the causes which constitute and govern these organs them selves; because, th e d eep er we penetrate belo w the surface of things, the m ore we find their faculties pronounced, a nd the greater their co ntrast and diversity. Thus, to determ ine the course and periods wh ich the hands of a clock describe over its dial, we have m erely to observe with our eyes, and follow their m onotonous m ove ments, because, here, there is on ly one fact, and one fo rmula is sufficient to describe and exp lain it.

Another hypothesis If the authors of the two foregoing hypotheses were not restrained from publishing them , though so far from explaining the origin of the st ars, I m ay, in m y turn, venture to propose a third, even though it sho uld m eet with no better success. At all events, this hypo thesis will not be liable to the objections of analysts, as, like the other two, it will not b e given as th e result of observation and calculation. Besides, its object will not be to describe the course and m ove ments of stars; this, in our day, would be superfluous; the exact sciences have carried our knowledge, on this head, to a degree of perfection, which, unless to extend it, we can, at least, no longe r question or resist. Nor will it b e presen ted as seeking to e xplain th e kind of convul sion or impulse which may have put the heavenly bodies in motion, in the way we now see them circulate. To undertake this, I should have , first, to be agreed with the sava ns as to whence this world com es, and whither it goes, a thing which they do not tr ouble them selves about, believing it impossible to know it. The hypothesis in que stion will, th en, sim ply follow the principle laid do wn above, viz . that the laws of creation increase in num ber, and the properties of things increase in energy, in proportion as we penetrate their depths. But its principal ob ject will be to give an idea o f the origin of the heavenly bodies, and for mation of these we call planets; and, in doing this, we shall apply the principle alluded to. Before stating the hypothesis, I m ust rem ind the reader that its author, Jacob Boehm e, took for granted the existence of an Universal P rinciple, at once the Suprem e Ruler and Source of everything that is; that he recognised the nature of thinking Man, as distinct from the anim al order; and the degrada tion of the human species, which has extended to the universe itself, and converted it into a m ere prison and tom b for us , instead of being our abode of glory, etc. Boehme' s hypothesi s Boehm e wa s persuaded, like the savant Lapla ce (p. 261), that everyt hing is connected in the imm ense chain of truths: therefore, in de veloping his system , he made use of every ground and data which em brace all things ; b ecause if, in idea, we were to separate a portion of the universal system , to m ake of it a system apart, we could never succeed in dividing the springs which connect this partial system with the general.

He believed that these seven bases or for ms exis ted also in th is pres ent d isordered Na ture which we inhabit, but only under restraint, a nd counteracted by powerful tramm els, from which they used ev ery effort to disen gage th em selves, to vivify the d ead elem entary substances, and produce all we see that is sensible in the universe. He endeavours to give nam es to these seven fundam ental qualities or form s in our languages, which he says are degraded, as well as m an hi mself, and the universe. I would willingly abstain from giving this nom enclature, on account of the difficulty of its acceptan ce on the part of the reader; bu t as , without it, it would be still m ore difficult to understand the orig inal f orm ation of the plan ets, accord ing to the autho r's system , I must even speak his language. The first of these powers he calls as tringe ncy, or coercive powe r, as comprising and inclosing all the others. Thus, all that is hard in nature, bones, kern els of fruits, stones, appear to him to belong principally to this first for m or as tringency. He extends this denom ination also to desire, which, in all creatures, is the basis and spring of all they do, and, by its nature, attracts and em braces all that sho uld belong to th eir work, everyth ing accord ing to its kind. The second for m he calls gall, or bitterness, and he pretends that this, striving with its penetrating activity to divide th e astringency, opens the way of lif e, without which everything in Nature would rem ain dead. The third form he calls anguish, because life is compressed by the violence of the two preced ing p owers; but, in their confli ct, the as tringency is attenuated, becom es m ild, and turns to water, to give passa ge to fire, which was shut up in astringency. The fourth form he calls fire, becaus e, from the conflict and f erm entation of the three first, it rises through the water like a flash, which he calls fiery light ( éclair igné ), heat, etc., which agrees with what passes before our eyes w hen fire darts in flashes through the water of our thunder-clouds. The fifth form he calls light, becaus e light co mes after fire, as we see in o ur hearths, fireworks, and other physical phenom ena. The sixth fo rm he calls sound, becau se sound, in fact, com es after light, as we perceiv e when a gun is fired, or, as we are sup posed to speak, only after having thought.

Now we will proceed with th e hypothesis in question. Boehme' s hypothesi s continued The original generation or form ation of the planets and all stars was, according to our author, in no other way than that according to which the wondrous harm onical proportions of Divine W isdom have been engendered from all eternity. For, when the great chan ge took place in one of the regions o f prim itive Nature, th e light went out in that reg ion, which em braced the spa ce of the present Nature; and this region, which is the present Nature, becam e as a dead body, and had no m ore m otion.    -    65    -"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

This place, or centre, according to o ur aut hor, is the place in wh ich our sun is kindled. Out of this place o r centre all k inds o f qualities, form s, or powers, which fill and cons titu te th e universe, are engendered and produce d, all in conform ity with the laws of divine generation; for he adm its, in all beings, and eternally in th e Sup rem e W isdom, a centre in which a sevenfold production or subdivision takes place. He calls this centr e the Separator. He considers the sun as the focus and vivifyi ng organ of all the power s of Nature, as the heart is the focus and vivifying organ of all the powers of anim als. He considers it as the only natural light of this world, and pretends that, besi des this sun, there is no other true light in the house of death; and that, although th e stars were also depositaries of som e of the properties of the higher and p rim itive Nature, and alth ough they sh ine in ou r ey es, yet they are hard bou nd under the hungry fire of Nature, which is the fourth form ; that all their desire is towards the sun, and that they get all their light fr om it.

To explain this restoration of the universe, which yet is tem porary and incom plete, he pretends that, at the tim e of the great cha nge, a barrier was placed by the S uprem e Power between the light of eternal Natu re and the conflagration of our world; that thereby this world then becam e a m ere dark valley ; that there was no longer any light th at cou ld shine in what was shut up in this inclosure; that all pow ers and forms were there im prisoned, as in death; that by the great anguish they experienced they heated them selves, especially in th e m iddle of this great inclosu re, which is the p lace of our sun. He pretends that when th e ferm entation of th eir anguish in this place attained its h eigh t, by force of heat, then that light of Eternal W isdom, which he calls Love, or SOPHIA, pierced through th e inclosure of separation, and cam e to balance the heat; b ecause, in an in stant, a brilliant light arose in what he calls the power, or the unctuosity of water, and lit the h eart of the water, which m ade it temperate and healing.

Hence proceeded the earth and stones. But they were not yet brought in to a m ass, they were scatte red abroad in this imm ense profundity; and, by the powerful and secret pr esence of light, this m ass was presently conglom erated and collected tog ether from all space. The Earth is a condensation of the seven pow ers or form s; but th e author looks upon it only as th e excrem ent of everyth ing that was made substan tial in space, at the universal condensation, which does not prevent there having been other kinds of condensation in other parts of space. The central point, or heart of this conglom erated m ass, belonged originally to the solar centr e. But that is no lo nger s o. Th e Earth has becom e a centre of itself . It turns, once in twenty-four hours, round itself, and, once a year, round the sun, from whi ch it gets revivification, and seeks virtuality. It is the fire of the sun that m akes it revolve. When it has reco vered its plenitude, at the e nd of its cou rse, it w ill belong again to the solar c entre. MARS . – But if the ligh t m astered the fire in the place of the sun, the sho ck and oppositio n o f the light o ccasioned, in the sam e pl ace, a terrible igneous eru ption, by which there was shot forth from the sun, as it were, a storm y frightful flash, having in it the rage of fire. When the power of Light passed from the Eternal Source of the superior water, through the in- closure of separation, in the place of the sun, and ki ndled the inferior water, then the flash shot out of the water with a frightful violen ce; hence the inferior becam e corrosive. But this flash of fire could go no further than wh ere th e ligh t, which went af ter and pursued it, was able to reach it. At that dis tance, it was taken prisone r by the light. There, it stopped, and took possession of that pl ace; and, it is this flas h of fire that form s what we call the planet Mars. Its particular quality is nothin g but the explosion of a poisonous bitter fire, w hich shot out from the sun. What prevented the light from catching it sooner, was the intense rage of the flash, and its rapidity; it was not m ade captive by the light, till the light had com pletely im pregnated and subdued it. There it now is, lik e a ty rant; it s trugg les a nd gets furious, at bei ng unable to penetrate further in to space; it is a prick ing go ad, througho ut the whole circum scrip tion of this world: for, in f act, its of fice is to agitate all thing s, by its revo lution in the wheel of Nature ; from whence every th ing receives its reaction. It is the ga ll of Nature, a stim ulant, which he lps to light the Su n, as the ga ll in the hum an body stim ulates and lights the heart.

SATURN . – Although Saturn was created at the sam e time as the universal wheel of this present Nature, yet it does not take its origin o r ex trac tion f rom the Sun; but its source is the severe, astringent, hungry anguish of the whole body of this universe, For, as the lum inous power of the Sun could not relax, or m oderate the hungry rigidity of space, especially in the height above J upiter, therefore, this sam e en tire circum ference rem ained in a terrible anguish, and no warm th could wake up in it, on account of the cold and astringency which ruled there. Nevertheless, as the power of m otion had extend ed even to the roo t of all th e form s of Nature, by the eruption and introduction of the powe r of light, this prevented Nature from being at rest; it underwent the pains of labour, and th e rigid hungry region, above the height of Jupiter, engendered from the spirit of hunger, the astrin gent, cold, austere s on, the planet Saturn.

Saturn is no t tied to its place, as the S un is; it is n o foreign circum scriptio n, corporifie d in the im mensity of space; it is a son en gendered out of rigid an guish, hunger, and cold, and the cham ber of death.

Its office is, drying up, and contracting the pow ers of Nature, thereby br inging eve ry thing in to c orporeity; it is an astringent power, which especia lly engenders bones in creatures. As the Sun is the heart of life, and one origin of what are called spir its, in the body of this universe; so, it is Saturn, which comm ences all co rporeity. In these two orbs, resides the power of the whole universal body. W ithout their pow er, there could be no creature, no configuration, in the natural universal body. (Uranus was not known in our author' s tim e, and is plunged still deep er in the space of rigid ity and cold; and m ay, accord ing to the doctrine we have just read, have had the s ame origin as Saturn. As to the tw o new planets, Ceres and Pallas, b etween Mars and Jupiter, they m ay derive, m ore or less, from the original causes of their two neighbours, nam ely, light and fire.) VENUS . – The gentle planet Venus, the m oving-power ( mobile ) of love in Nature, originates in effluvia from the Sun. When the two sources of motion and life rose to th e place of th e Sun, by the kindling of the unctuosity of the water, then m eekness, by the power of the ligh t, pen etra ted in to the cham ber of death, by a gentle friendly im pregnati on, descending beneath itself, like a spring of water, and in an opposite direc tion to the rage of the flash. From thence cam e gentleness and love in the s ources of life. For, when the light of the Sun had im pregnated the whole body of the Sun, th e power of life, which arose from the first im pregnation, m ounted above itself, as when we light wood, or strike fi re out of a stone. We first see light, and from the light, the fire explodes; after the e xplosion of the fire, com es the power of the burning body; the light , with this power of the burning body, rises imm ediately above the explosion, and reigns much higher and m ore powerfully, than the explosion of the fire; and thus m ust the existe nce of the Sun, and the two planets, Mars and Jupiter, be conceived.

It is the separator; it wakes up the germ s in every thing; it is th e chief work er in the planetary w heel. As to the origin of Mercury in the planetary or der, the author attributes it to the trium ph gained over astringency by the Light-Power, because this astr ingency, which held sound, or Mercury, shut up in all the for ms and powers of Nature, set it free by its own attenuation. This Mercury, which is the separator in every thin g that ha s lif e, the pr incipal worker in the plan etary wheel, and , as it were, the speech ( par ole ) of Nature, could not, in the conflagration, take a seat far from the Sun, which is the focus, centre, an d heart of this Nature, because, being born in the fire, its fundam ental pr operties op posed it, and retained it n ear th e Sun, from whence it exercises its pow ers upon every thing existing in the w orld. It transm its its powers into Saturn, and Saturn begins their corporification. The author p retends that Mercury is impregnated and fe d continually by the solar substance ; that in it is found th e knowledge of what was in the order above, before the Light- Power had penetrated th e inclo sure into the so lar centre, and into th e space of the univ erse (which m ay be the secret cause of so m any cu rious researches about the m ineral m ercury).

Fo r the author gives us sufficiently to understand that the Light- Power acted a great part in the form ation of our pl anetary system , as the Fire-Power did in that of the stars, which he looks upon as bein g in the hungry ebullition of fire. Now, as harmony can exist only in the union of the powers of light and fire, the com ets might have been originally com posed of both, but in different degrees, as presum able from the great v ariety of their app earance and colour. From thence it m ight be im agined that the func tions of these com ets would be to serve as organs of correspondence, between the solar regi on and that of the star s ; and this conjecture might be thought to be supported, by observing that , in their perihelion, they approach the sun; and that, from the prodigious exentricity of their ellipses, they m ay convey the solar influences to the sidereal regions, and bring back the reaction of the stars, to the Sun. It would not be even necessary for the com ets to approach very near to the starry region, when they ascend towards it; as, when they com e into ou r so lar region, w e see th at th ey keep, even in their perihelion, at a cons iderable distance from the Sun.

Thus, before the discovery of the new plan ets, the ignorance we were in of their existence, did not prevent astronom ers from foretelling, with tolerable exactness, the return of the com ets; because those unknown pl anets, bein g either too distan t or to o sm all, could not produce any sensible perturbation on com ets passing by them . Inhabitancy of the Planets I will no t qu it th e subject of astronomy, w ithout exam ining the conjecture commonly accepted, th at, as the oth er plan ets have several points of sim ilarity to ou r earth, they are probably inhabited likew ise. I have said, in “L' Esprit des Choses”, that the Earth would not exist the less, even if it were not inhabited, since this property of inha bitancy is only secondary, as it were, and foreign to its existence. Thus, although we see it inhabited, this is not a decisive reason that the other planets should be so also, notwithstanding the analogy which authorizes the conjecture. We see that vegetation is not a constituent and necessary proper ty of the earth, since it is barren in m any clim ates; and sands and rocks, which are earthy substances, are sym bols of ster ility. We see also, that the sun is the d irect m eans whic h develops this vegetation in the earth, which increases in luxuriance, according to its proxim ity to that orb, and is barren where too rem ote f rom it; bu t we also see tha t, when it appr oaches too n ear, and the sun takes th e preponderance, then the earth b ecomes calcined, and turns to sand and dust; that is, it becom es barren. From all this we m ay presum e, that, being su sceptible of vegetation, it has been placed, in the series of planets, in the rank which was nece ssary, and at exactly the right distance from the sun, to acco mplish its secondary object of vegetation; and from this we might infer th at the o ther planets are either too near or too remote from the sun, to vegetate. Much light m ight doubtless be gathered, in re gard to the question of vegetation in the planets, from their difference in density; and, perhaps, this m ight throw som e light on the nature of those bodies them selves, to all of which we can hardly refuse a fundam ental identity of substance, since we find a perfect analogy between the earth and the other planets, in the laws of their m ove ments, weight, and attraction; and this is the guide in those beautiful observations in astronom y a nd m athem atics, which are continually m ade, as to the m arch of those great bodies, and all their exterior p roperties. But, while we wait for this light, we m ust, at least, in general, s uppose an individual and distinct destination to each plan et, whether inhabited or not, if we would arrive at anything satisfactory about them ; for, the probable sterility of the other planets, on account of their too great proxim ity to, or distance from the sun, woul d seem to be also a reason for presum ing that - 73 -"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

The destination of the Universe and Man must first be known Now, on this subject, no system can be pres ented, without first supposing a destination to the universe, and knowing what it is; and hum an s ciences pretend that it is im possible to know this. For the sam e reason, no destin ation can be accep ted for the un iverse, with out first agreeing as to the nature of Man; that it m ay be known whether this des tination and Man are not co-re lated.

In short, to know the destin ation of Man, we should also know what to think of that General Pr inciple of th ings, that Suprem e Power, to which the nam e of God has been given ; and hum an sciences blot this Power out of the order of beings. Discouraged by the schools of religion, in which m ore is affirm ed than prove d, they have confounded th e principle with the abuse, and proscribed both.

This I will n ot attem pt, and the f ew rem arks I have m ade on the other planets, m ust therefore suffice.

The reason why observers refuse to give our earth a distinguished destination am ongst the heavenly bodies, is all reduced to this, that it is but a sm all planet, almost im perceptible in the vast extent of the solar system , which itself, since the discovery of th e nebulosities, and the common opinion, that th e stars are all suns, is bu t an invisible point in the imm ensity of space. If the visible size of things were the only si gn or rule by which to judge of their real value, this objection would be unanswerable.

The Earth, which is represented by our Germ an author as bu t the ex crem ent of Nature, and which, according to the principle of Man' s degradation, is only a pr ison, has no occasion to be the cen tre of the astral m ovem ents, as the an cients and Tycho Brahé believed: a dung-heap or a prison is not comm onl y the centr e or chief place of a country. We see further, it is true, that governm ents feed their prisoners, but not with fine bread and delicate m eats; in the sam e way we see that our Earth vegetates, is fruitful, and productive, because, in s pite of our q uality of pris oners, Suprem e Justice is still quite w illing to g ive us our food. But we see at the s ame tim e that, as its pr isoners, Suprem e Jus tice allows our Earth to produce, naturally, nothing but im perfect fruits, a nd feed us with a bread of affliction, a wild bread, and, only by the sweat of our brows can we succeed in am eliorating a little ou r m ode of life; as, in h uman justic e, the pr isone r is r educed to the commonest diet, and allowed nothing beyond his rations but what he pays f or. If, in our hum an justice, prisone rs arc reduced to so m iserable an exis ten ce, we also s ee the succours of benevolence and charity, from time to tim e, pe netrate to their confinem ent; and, how repulsive soever their dunge ons m ay be, we see sacred a nd religious consolations are brought to them daily. In short, the eye of co mpassion, even to the highe st in authority, som e- tim es visits these dens of crim e, however vile the condition of the convi cts m aybe. W hat, then, must it not b e, when the prisone r is n early related to the Sove reign ? All this is a sure sign that if, on the one hand, we are subjected to the severity of a rigorous bondage, it is, on the other, tem pered by l ove and gentleness; as, in fact, is exemplified physically by the place the Earth occupies, whic h, as every one knows, is between Mars and Venus. Succours given to Man in his prison If, then, the Spirit-Man would open his eyes , he would soon recogni se in him self the innum erable succours w hich the beneficence of th e Suprem e Divine Authority sends him , even in his place of confine ment.

The knowl dge of Man and that of Nature must advance together e But, to attain a correct knowledge of what th e Earth is, und er all these asp ects, it is m ore essential still to study Man, in rela tion to all that concerns him ; and if he do not, with persevering zeal, cu ltivate the sa cred germ s which are da ily planted in him for this en d, he will ag ain fall under the common ignorance and blind conclusion s respecting both the earth and himself. The Univers e and Man form two progression s which are bou nd to each o ther, and proceed ab reast, and the last term of the knowled ge of Man would lead him to the last term of the knowledge of Nature. Now, as hum an sciences en tirely discard this acti ve or positive knowledge of Man, who alone can and ought to teach us all, it is no t asto nishing th at those sciences rem ain so far short of a true knowledge of Nature. In fact, although the wonders of the natura l sciences, especially those of astronom y, afford us pleasures, which lift us, so to speak, ab ove this narrow and dark world, and enable us to enjoy and feel the superiority of our thinking faculty over our sens ible being; yet, it must be confessed, these wonders still fail to satisfy all the wants of our Spirit-M an; and, if we m ay know Nature, experim entally, by our senses,-if we may m easure it by our sciences, – a third power would seem to be wanting to put it in action. For, if we have desires, intelligence, and a great stock of inward activity, as is evident from all our acts, there ought to be nothing une mployed in us: Nature being our appanage, we ought not, as suzerains, to lim it ourselves to m app ing our dom ains, we o ught also to have the right to dispose of them at pleasure. Thus, our most celebrated savans in natura l science, our m ost fa mous astronom ers, ought, from this single observation, to be convinced that they do not enjoy their full rights as spiritual men. - 77 -"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

When pure air com es to us, and finds an entrance into our dwellings, can it be m erely to bring us a new m edium of life? May it not also be to receive it s own freedom from us, and deliv erance fro m the corros ive action to which it h as been subject, ever sin ce the fi rst crim e? And we, by our putrid exhalations and poisonous miasm s, and, still m ore by the infectio n of our thoughts, add to its corruption and destructiv eness. The earth w e walk upon opens to us all its po res as so m any mouths, asking for a balm to heal its wounds, and, instead of giving it repose a nd new life, what we give to quench its thirst withal, is men' s blood, which we shed in our fu rious and fanatical wars, and which, poured into its bosom , steam ing with the wrath and rage of men, can only exasperate its pains. Like the Go ddess, under whose feet, flowers sprang up on Mount Ida, we also m ay fill our gardens with beautiful plants , and m agnificent trees; bu t, instead of restoring to them the life of the trees and plants of Eden, we com e, in idle crowds, to walk am ongst them . We fill the s urrounding atm osphere with effete, if not m ortiferous words; we intercept the powerful influences of Nature; and, for fear, even that the fine trees whic h constitute the chief ornam ent of these gardens, and alm ost reprodu ce in Nature, the Elysium of the poets, should preserve their vigour too long, we burn them to th eir very roots, with wh at is m ost corrosive, without once reflecting whether chaste and m ode st eyes m ay not be ne ar, to blush at our immoral, an d revolting indecencies.

The Sabbatic rest of the Earth The great sin of the Jews, accord ing to Moses, was, their not having given rest o r sab bath to the earth. After the calam ities and total d isper sion, with which he had ju st threatened them , Moses adds: (Lev. xxvi. 34) “Then shall the land enjoy her S abbaths as l ong as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enem ies' land, then shall the land rest ; As long as it lieth desolate, shall it rest, because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it”. Com pare with this, the idea we ought to have of the people of Israel who are the Lord' s inheritance (Is. xix. 25.). Com pare the people under this splendid title, with the idea we should for m of Man, who ought to be preem inently the L ord' s inheritance when this universe which now contai ns us, arrives at its term . Lastly, com pare the high Ministry which we are endeavouring to retr ace to the eyes of Man, with the work the child ren of Israel h ad to accom plish in the land of Judæa, which was, to give sabbath or rest to the earth, and we shall find that Man, and the Jewish people, had the sam e destination and em ployment, the same title and q ualif ica tion. If there is an y difference, it is in Man' s favor. Israel was but a sketch or epitom e of Ma n. Man is Israel en grand. Israel wa s charged to give rest to the pr om ised land; Man is charged to give rest to the whole earth, not to sa y, to the whole universe. But, it is essential that we should understand this word sabbatic rest , that we m ay better know what we ought to understand by the Spiritual Ministry of Man. We can hardly avoid the belief, that, independe ntly of the earthly fruits which the earth - 81 -"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns. Edward B. Pen ny bears for us so abundantly, it has other fruits to produce, besides these. The first indication we have, of this, is the difference we observe betwee n the wild f ruits which the ear th bea rs natu rally, and those w e cause it to bring forth by cultivatio n; which, to seeing eyes, proclaim s that the earth wants only m an's help to bring forth still m ore interesting m arvels. A second indication is, that th ere are few pagan nations who have not rendered religious worship to the Earth. Lastly, Mythology comes to support the conjectur e, by the fable of the golden apples in the gard en o f the Hesperides; by teaching that m en were instructed in the art of agricu lture, by a Goddess; and, according to Hesiod, that the Eart h was born immediately af ter chaos; that she married Heaven, and was the m other of Gods, an d Giants, of Goods and Evils, of Virtues and Vices. If, from these natural and m ythological observa tions, we pass to traditions of another order, we see, (Gen. iv. 11 and 12) that, after th e m urder of Abel, it was said to Cain: “And now thou art cursed from the earth, which hath opene d her m outh to receive thy brother' s blood from thy hand; w hen thou tillest the ground, it will no t henceforth yield unto thee her strength”. Now, we do not see that the earth m ust be cultivated only by the hands of the righteous, under pain o f sterility. N or that m en's blood prev ents its fecu ndity. The fields of Palestine were saturated with the blood of the inhabitants, w hom the children of Is rael were ordered to exterm inate ; and the f ertility of thos e plains was one of the pro mises, and part of the re com pense which the Je ws were entitled to cla im, if they obeyed the laws which were given them . Neither do we observe that, in our wars, the ground in which we bury the dead in heaps, is struck with barrenness. On the contrary, it is remarkabl e for fert ility. Thus, while hum an blood unjustly shed, calls for vengeance from he aven, we do not find that the te rre strial laws o f ve getation on our globe are inverted or suspended, in consequence of hom icide. When, therefore, we see it said to Cain, th at when he tilled the ground it w ould not yield its fruit, we have every reason to believe that , by the tillage here spoken of, another than the ordinary cultivation was m eant; now what idea can we for m of this other tillage, than that it was part of the true Spiritual Minist ry of Man; that high privilege which was given him , to m ake the earth enjoy her sabbaths? A priv ilege, however, which is incom patible w ith sin, and which m ust cease, o r be suspended, in those who wa lk not in the paths of righteousn ess. But we cannot well penetrate the m eaning of this word sabbatism , without recurring to the notions of which we have pr eviously given som e account, and ta king, at least for granted, the seven form s or powers, which our Germ an author establishes as the ground or basis of Nature. We m ust, besides, agree with him , that, as a consequence of the gr eat change, these seven for ms or powers are bu ried in the earth as well as in the other stars, concentr ated, as it were, or in suspension ; and that this suspense is what keep s the earth in privation or sufferance, since only by the developm ent of these form s or powers, can it produ ce a ll th e prope rties of whic h it is    -    82    -"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

Finally, we must picture to ourselves, Man, announcing an universal tendency to im prove everything on the earth, and as comm issioned by the All-W ise, (Gen. ii. 15), to cultivate the paradise of bliss, and w atch over it. Now, what could this culture be, but to maintain in activity, in right m easure and proportion, the working of these seven powers or form s, of which the garden of paradise had as much need as other p laces in creation ? Man m ust have been the depositary of the m ovi ng power of these seven f orm s, to be able to m ake them act accord ing to plans m arked out for him , and keep that ch osen place in repose, or enjoying its sabbath, since there is no rest or sabbath for any thing, but in so far as it can freely develop a ll its f aculties. In our days, although the m ode of m en's existe nce is prodigiously altered in consequence of the great change, the object of creation has no-wise altered on that account , and the Spirit-Man is still called to the s ame work, which is, to m ake the Ear th ke ep its s abbaths. All the d ifference con sists in th is, tha t now, he can perform this task only in a way which is both difficult and painful; and, above all, he can do it only through that sam e active m edium which was form erly appointed to give m otion to the seven fundam ental powers of Nature. So long as Man does not discharge this su blim e function, the earth suffers, because it does not enjoy its sabbaths. It suffers still m ore, if man reacts crim ina lly upon it, by trying to develop from it, powers which are blam eworthy or corrupt, and contrary to the plan he received. In the one case, the earth endures m an, notwithstanding his negligence ; in the other, it casts him out, as happened with the children of Israel. The rainbo w and the lesson it teaches We see a sensible im age of those seven pow ers, now shut up in the Earth, and in all Nature, in the physical phenom enon exhibited to our eyes, when the cloud s dissolve in rain, in sunshine. The aqueous substance, (which, according to som e profound and true observations, is, in every ord er, the conductor or propag ator of ligh t), by filling all space, presents a natural m irror to the sun' s rays. Those rays, penetrating into this aqueous el em ent, m arry their powers to those of which this said elem ent is depository; and, by this fruitf ul union, the sun and water, that is, the superior and inferior regions, m anifest to our sight, the septenary sign of their allian ce, which is, at the - 83 -"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns. Edward B. Pen ny sam e time, the septenary sign of their propertie s, since results are al ways analogous to the sources from which they derive. This sensible physical effect in Nature, afford s us a m ost instructive lesson, as to the state of concentration and invisibility in which these seven powers are, in Nature ; on the necess ity there is , th at their trammels m ust be broken, before they can recover their freedom ; on the constant action of the sun, which works only to aid their deliverance, and thus show to the universe, that it is th e friend of peace, and th at it exis ts o nly for the h appiness of all c reatures. When this rain, thus fecundated by the s un, descends upon the earth, it com es to work there, by its own marriage with the earth, the salutary results of vegetation, which we second by our own lab ours, and fro m which we derive su ch happy fruit; and thus, life, or the m aterial sabbath of Nature, is propagated, by a gentle progression, from the solar source, to us. But, this physical figurative phenom enon, with all its results, is pr oduced without the aid of Man' s Spi ritual Ministry, and yet it is for Man to give sabbatic rest to the earth; th erefore, we adm itted above, that it looked to him for anothe r cultivation, which, now, he can accom plish by hard labour only. In what the earth's sabbath of rest consists I fear not to affir m that th is glorious sabbath, which the Spirit-Man is comm issioned to bring to the earth, is to h elp it to celebrate the praises of the E ternal Prin ciple, and that, in a m ore expressive way than it can, by al l the f ruits it b rings f orth. This is the real term , to which all things in Nature tend. Their nam es, their properties, their seven powers, their language, in short, all is bur ied under the ruins of the prim eval universe; it is for us to sec ond their efforts, that they m ay again becom e harm onious voices, capable of singin g, each after its kind, the Canticles of Sovereign W isdom. But, how should they sing these Canticles, if this All-W ise, which is so much above them , did not employ an interm edium, a representa tive and image of itself, by which to cause its sweetness to reach them ? We have not here to show that Man is this inte rmedium ; all th at ha s been said, has had no other object but to establish this fact; and, notwithstanding the dark clouds which overhang the hum an fa mily, and the overpowering weight we have to bear, since we were plunged into this region of death, I flatter myself , that som e amongst m y fellow-creatures will b e found, who, in this sub lim e destin ation, will see noth ing which th eir true natu re will diso wn; and there m ay, perhaps, be som e, who will not contem plate its ch arm without a th rill.

Then, O Man, you are made capable of feeling the Earth' s pains, and those of all that com poses the universe; then, by virtue of the e normous difference there is between the infirm state of the seven powers, concealed in the ea rth, and your own revived po wers, you can relieve its suffering s, because y ou m ay then do for it, what has just been done for you. In sh ort, it is on ly when you enjoy your own sabbath, or your own rest, that you can help it to keep sabbath in its turn. It is only thus you become really m aster over Nature, and are able to help it to m anifest the treasures shut up in its wom b, and all thos e prodigies and m arvellous deeds, with which mythologies and traditions, sacred and profane, are filled, som e of which are a ttributable to im aginary Gods, but oth ers, to the r eal r ights of Man, when r evived in h is facultie s by the principle which gave him being.

But, before considering the nature of the Spir it-Man, we will enquire, in gene ral, what m ay be called Spirit, in any, or all classes and orders ; we will dis clos e the rad ical s ources from which this expression is derived; and begin by taking th e word Spirit in the different m eanings, under which it m ay be viewed, in our languages. The spirit of a thing m ay be considered to be the actual engenderi ng, whether partial or com plete, of the powers of its order. Thus m usic is known to us for what it is, only by the actual em ission of the sounds by which it reaches our ears, and wh ich are nothing but the effective expression, or active spirit of the design or picture it would represent. Thus, wind is the actual em ission of air, com pressed by the clouds or atm ospheric powers. And, in the elementary o rder, as soon as the com pression ceases, there is no m ore wind: now we know that the ancient langu ages used the sam e word to express wind, breath, and spirit. Thus, the breath of Man, and other anim als, is the actual em ission of what resu lts in them , from the union of the air, with their v ital powers; and, when their v ital po wers cease, their breath, spirit, or exp ression of life, ceases als o. Thus, the jet ( jaillissement ) of our thoughts, and what the world calls wit ( esprit ), in m an, is the actual em ission of what is developed by a secret ferm entation in the powers of our understanding, and this jet is cons equently the fruit of their actual engendering: and, when this secret ferm entation is suspended in us, we are as if we had no m ore thought, as if we had no more wit ( esprit ), although we still have in us, all the germ s which m ay produce it. Spirit, an emission of the Eternal Powers According to this exposition, we m ay, without fear, consider Spirit to be the fruit which proceeds p erpetually fro m the Suprem e Eternal Po wers, or from their Universal Unity, since, by the actual engendering, which pr oduces this fruit without inte rm ission, it ought, above all other em issions, to bear the nam e of Spirit, which we gi ve to whatever has the character of an em ission or actual expression.

Perpetual emission of Universal Unity, the Divine Being It seem s to m e, moreover, that it is no barre n or indifferent notion we here obtain of the charac ter of this Perp etu al Fruit of th e actua l engendering of Universal U nity, whose Powers are continually, necessarily, and excl usively dependent upon them selves; and if observers had thus considered this product ive unity in its character of actual necessary em ission, they would have derived greater prof it from their research es on the Divine and Universal B eing resulting from it, than by trying to scrutinize at fi rst starting, the Nature of this Being, as they do, and that, without looking at His Action; whilst His Action is probably His whole Nature: and th e co nsequence o f their false tactics has been, that, not only they have not found that Universal Being whom they sought am iss, but they have gone so far as to persuade them selves, that what they had not found, did not exist. If we had considered Universal Being, the spir itual, divine, and actual fruit of the pow ers of Eternal U nity, in His true character, we s hould have derived the fo llowing great advantage from it. Spirit, the fruit of all the powers of Unity As the fruit of every generation of which we have cognizance, repeats and represents everyth ing that cons titu ted the powe rs which en gendered it; s o, what we call Spirit, in the generative act of the Eternal Unity, can be nothing else than the actual and m anifest expression of everything without exception, th at belongs to that Eternal Unity : thus, it is for this Universal Spirit to m ake that Unity known to us, to desc ribe it to us entirely, as Man reproduces tem po- rarily, a ll th e pr operties of his father and m other, whose com plete living im age he is. Yes, if we look with our understa nding attentively, at this actual perpetua l fruit of Eternal Unity, we feel that, since the powers of this Un ity are perpetually, nece ssarily, and exclusively dependent o n each other, and the fruit of their union is an actu al engendering, as boundless as it is endless, this f ruit m ust rea lly be th e actua l and com plete expression of their m utual union; it must have within it, and actually and universally represent, all that can serve as ground to the mutual attraction of these pow ers, one towards another. - 88 -"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

The Spirit alone can reveal itself But, to this Universal B eing, this actual perpetual em ission of Eternal Unity, alone, it likewise belongs to afford us this knowledge, as it belongs alone to the fruit of the natural generations before our eyes, to afford that of the powers wh ich generated them . Hence, those who have disowned th is necessary Being, this actual p erpetual fruit of the engendering of Eternal Unity, ha ve naturally ended in no more recognising the Eternal Unity itse lf, since absolutely n othing but th is ac tual fruit could repre sent it to the m with all its constituent qualities and properties ; in like m anner, if we turned our eyes away from the fruits of the earth, w e should soon lose knowledge of the vi rtual generative qualities of Nature; and if we considered m an, mute and m otionless only, we s hould soon lose the idea of his extraordinary activity of body, and the vast extent of his thought and intelligence. Hidden generation and anasto mosi s of beings If the powers of Eternal Unity are necessarily one in thei r engendering, and the Universal Being or Fru it which p roceeds from their eng endering, necessarily m akes but one with them , this, doubtless, is a fundam enta l reason why His generation is concealed from us, since we cannot conceive Him separate from His generative Sources. But if, on another hand, there m ust necessarily be a progressiv e and gradual union of th e entire Universal Unity with every possible produ ction which appears befo re our eyes, we ought no longer to feel surprised, that we have never been able to penetrate the generation of things, since, not only do the generative powers, in these partial gene rations, also follow the law of Unity, acco rding to th eir order, but even their fru it also m akes only one with th em , aft er the pattern of Universal Unity, at l east in the root, and the genera tive act, though, afterwards, the fruit detaches itself from its gen erativ e sour ces, as belonging to the reg ion of successio ns.

Yes, Eternal W isdom and Love cherish thei r own glory, and our in telligen ce also ; they seem afraid of allowing us to believe that an ything had a beginning, and that there is anything which is not Eternal; since, tr uly, no creature, not even m an, ha s any idea of his own beginning, unless as to his body; and he ac quires even this know ledge as m uch from the weariness which this body occasions his spirit, as from the exampl es of his reproduction wh ich he witnesses daily ; for, in fact, nothing can have a comm ence ment (absolutely speaking) but evil and disorder. And, as Man belongs to Unity, or the Centre, whic h is the m iddle of all things, he m ay grow old in his body, and not the less believe him self to be in the m idst of his days. Thus the co ncealed o rigin of things is a speaking evidence of their eternal and invincible source, and we feel that ther e is nothing but death and evil w hich comm ence, but that life, perfection, happiness, could not be, if they had not always been. The Univer sal Being everywher engender s or reveals Itself, especially in us e And this confirm s the principle we have esta blished; if, in all the exam ples we have given, nothing can bear the nam e of Spirit, but by its presenting the phenom enon of a n actual and always possible em ission, it is very certain th at th e Universa l Being m ust bear th e same character, an d thence dev elop to ou r intelligen ce, the actual an d nece ssary plenitude of an uninterrupted existence, wit hout beginning or principle. Happy is he who can elevate his thought to this height, and m aintain it there! He will thereby attain such clearness of intelligence, that the ground- of all that exists, in the order of things invisible, as well as of those which are visible, will appear to him sim ple, active, perm anent, and, so to speak, diaphanous; seeing that the Universal Being, by his continual living Actuality, must carry everywhere the Light and limpidity of which He is the perpetual focus. But, if we can thus consider the living con tinual Actuality of this Suprem e and Universal Focus, in all visible and invisib le things, what will it be when we consider it in ou rse lves, and see what it works in our own being? For, we shall discover a remarkable difference, in reg ard to ourselves; that is, that we can, by reflection, readily observe this actu ality in all individual things, but that we m ay feel it, in real ity, and in nature, in ourselves. Yes, if but for a m oment, we would dive into the depths of our inward existence, we should soon feel, that all the divi ne S ources, with their Universa l Spirit, abound and flow at the root of our being, that we are a constant and perpetual result of the engendering of our Principle, that it is con tinua lly in its actua lity within us, and thus, af ter th e definition we have given of Spirit, we m ay easily see, how a being, who is ca pable of feeling the eb ullition of the Divine Spring within him , has a right to the nam e of Spirit-Man. - 90 -"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns. Edward B. Pen ny Man's origin We m ay now arrive at a fixed idea of Man' s origin. Man was and is continually born in the Eternal Source, which ceases no t to be in th e perpetu al in toxication of its own wonders and delights. This is the reason we ha ve so often said that Man can live only by adm iration, since, as shown by the Germ an author we have quoted, no creature can be nourished except by the substance or fruits of its own m other. Desire and Will But Man is also born in the Source o f desire; for God is an Eternal Des ire and W ill to be manifested, that His Magism , or the sweet im pression of His existence, may propagate and extend to all that is capable of receiving and feeling it. Man ought also to liv e by this desire and will ; and he is charg ed to keep thes e sublim e aff ection s alive within him ; for, in God, desire is always will, whilst in Man it rare ly reaches this term , without which nothing is done. And it is by this power which is given to Ma n of bringing his desire up to the character of will, that he ought really to be an im age of God. Union of the Divine Will with Man's desire In f act, he may obtain th at the Div ine W ill itse lf com e in him, to join h is desire ; he m ay then work and act in concert with Divinity, w ho thus condescends, in a m anner, to share His work, His properties, and His power s with Man: and if, in giving hi m desire, which is as the root of the plant, He reserves the W ill, which is as its bud or flower, it is not to the in tent th at he should rem ain deprived of this Divin e W ill, and not know it; but, on the contrary, His wish is that he should ask for it, know it, and do it him self; for, if Man is the plant, God is the sap, or life. And what would becom e of the tree if the sap did not run in its veins? The Divine Covenant It is in these deep, yet true and natural grounds, of the em anation of Man, that the divine contract is found, which binds the S uprem e Source to Man; a contract by which this Suprem e Source, in tr ansm itting to Man all its own sacr ed germ s, could plant them in him , only accom panied with all th e funda mental irrefragab le laws which constitute its own Eternal creative Essence, and from whic h it could not itself depart , without ceasing to be . And this contract changes not, as ours do, by the will of the parties. In form ing Man, the Suprem e Source is supposed to have said to him : “W ith the eternal grounds or b ases of m y being, and th e laws etern ally inheren t in them , I constitu te thee Man; I have no rules to prescribe to thee but those wh ich result naturally from my eternal harmony; I - 91 -"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

Weight, number, an d measure in Nature By paying attention to the fixed and regular laws, by which Nature produces and governs all its works, and following, step by step, care fully the tracks it leaves behind, we recognise everywhere a weight, a n umber, and a m easure wh ich are its inseparable m inisters, which shows that these ex ist prim itively in th e Source above, and constitute the eternal Trinary, wh ose im age we find in ourselves, and on which the divine contra ct rests. We see, m oreover, th at these three interior bases suffice the Al mighty for laying th e foundations of all the works of Nature, and characterising externally all th e varieties of His productions; or those external developm ents of for m, colour, duration, sm ell, essential properties, qualities, etc., things which are not num bers, though they have num bers for signs and index. It is by thes e m eans that the Universa l Trinar y v aries, ad inf initum , and so multiplies its operations that it keeps them as if always work ing in the infinite on which they depend, so that Man can never num ber them nor pos sess him self of th em ; and, in fact, it is sufficient for him to have the us e of them ; he is f orbidden to possess th em as his property, s ince , by that m ultiplicity of m eans which the All-W ise ha s of varying the m anifestations of its Universal T rinary, He secures to Him self alone the right of property in this generative act ; never ceasing, ho wever, at the sam e time to m anif est this inf inity outwardly to be adm ired. The opposing power in Nature Without the contrary power, which brought di sorder into the Universe, N ature would know no disharm ony, and never depart from the laws prescribed by the Eternal plans; but, notwithstanding its disorder, when we consider Nature as co mposed of s o m any various instrum ents and organs, serving as channels to li fe universally diffused, we perceive a gradation in its work s, which f ills us with admira tion of th at bene ficent W isdom which directs the harm onious course of things.    -    92    -"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

Pen ny Steps in the knowledge of Na ture, and plan, and Spirit We shall, indeed, observe, that in the series of Nature' s works everyth ing s erves as a step to arrive, not only at the next , but at the highest degree. The play and harm ony of the phenom ena of Natu re lead to the knowledge of its grounds and constitu ent elem ents. The knowledge of its co nstitu ent elem ents leads to that of the imm aterial tem poral powers which create these phenom ena. The knowledge of these imm aterial tem poral powers leads to Spirit, for they do not in them selves possess th e key of the general design. The knowledge of Spirit leads to that of the communication between it and our thought, since we at once hold intercours e with it, and all intercourse supposes two or m ore analogous beings; it cannot take p lace when th ere is on ly o ne. The knowledge of the comm unication of our thought with S pirit leads us to the Light of God, since this Light alone can be the central gene rative point of everythi ng that is light and action. The knowledge of the Light of God leads us to know our own wretchedness, through our awful privation of that L ight, which alone can be our life. The knowledge of our wretch edness shows us th e necessity of a resto rativ e power; sin ce Love, which is eternal order, and the eternal desire of order, can never cease p resen ting th is ord er and lov e to us, to enjo y them . The knowledge of a restorative power leads us to the recovery of the holiness of our essence and origin, s ince it br ings us again in to th e bosom of our prim itiv e gene rative source, our eternal trinary. Thus everything in physicalas, in spiritual nature, has an object of increase and im prove ment, which m ight serve as a thread in ou r labyrinth, and help us to give value to the rights of our divine contract; for, independently of our finding in this divine covenant f resh nourishm ent for that insatiable need we have of adm iring, we should learn be sides to fulfil one of the noblest functions of the Spiritual Ministry of Man, that of being able to share this suprem e happiness w ith our fellow-creatures. “Thy will be done ” According to this, when, since the fall, we as k f or the f ulfilm ent of the div ine will, this petition has a very profound, as we ll as a very natural m eaning; si nce it is asking that the divine covenant m ay recove r all its va lue; th at all des ire and will p roceeding fro m God m ay arriv e at its term , and, therefore, th at m an's soul m ay blossom ag ain in its true desire and orig inal will, which would m ake it participate in the d evelopm ent of t he desire an d will of God; so that we cannot ask - 93 -"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

Observe here, that, in the prayers which G od has recomm ended, He has not told m en to ask for what m ay not be granted to all; He prom ises only what is compatible with His universal munificence, which refers, in its turn, to their uni versal wants and His unive rsal glory. W hen we ask God for particular things which cannot be gi ven to all our fellow-creatures alike, such as goods, em ploym ents, dignities, we de part essentially from our law. What to pray for This proves that we ought never to ask Him for anything belonging to this world, because all in it is co unted and lim ited, so that it is im possible for ev ery body to have profit ou t of it; and if one is pro vided with a large sh are, another m ust necess arily be depriv ed of it. This s hows how foreign to th e prim itive c ode esta tes were, and th at the Gospe l prec ept, as to re lin quish ment of goods, is intim ately connected with the exac t and funda mental grounds of true justice. It shows that we ought, on the contrary, to as k incessantly for things of the real and infinite world in which we were born, because nothing can com e upon a m an from that world without thereby opening the way for it to descend upon all. In the prayers recomm ended by God to m en, th e first thing asked for refers to God and His kingdom, that it m ay com e; only after this is Man thought of. What is asked for, for Man, nowise refers to earthly things; the daily bread spoken of is not our elementary food, for Man has his hands to labour with, and the eart h to till, and we are forbidden to be careful about the wants of our bodies, as the heathen ar e. This daily bread, which m ust be gained by the sweat of the brow, is the bread of Life, which God distributes to His children daily, and which alone can help forward our work. Finally, we ask forgiveness of our si ns, and to be kept from temptation. All in th is pr ayer is Sp irit, all is div ine ch arity, because its object generally is that divine contra ct, to m aintain whic h all have to contribute.

It is, in fact, an indi spensable law, that any region m ust em brace, rule, possess, and dispose o f all that co mes after it, or in a lower rank than itself. Thus the divine region, being above every region, it is not surprising that, on attaining it, we attain the suprem acy over all things. Let us seek God, and nothing else, if we would have all things; for this, we were born in the sour ce of Eternal Desire and Universal SPIRIT. Anim als and other things of Nature have also a d esire ; but th e will that c rowns this de sire is quite foreign to them , and separate from the m: for this re ason they ha ve not to pray, as m an has; they have only to act. Light is part of the Divine Covenant with Man But Man too k his orig in not only in the Sources of adm iration , and desir e, and will, bu t in the Source of Light also, and, conseq uently, this Light also form ed one of the bases of the divine contract with him . For this c ause, Man is th e f irst term of th e rela tio n between him self and all the na tura l and spiritual objects arou nd him . For this reas on, if he cannot account to h imself for hi s own existence, h e will nev er account for that of any other production or em anated being. Man is the scale of measurement for all creatures In fact, if Man had his origin in the real s ource of adm iration, desire, will, and light – in a word, in the source of reality – he becom es, in his quality of a real being, the scale of every object and creature that approaches him , and he can m easur e their existence, laws, and action, only by what they differ from hi m: a profound and im portant truth, which m any see m to distrust, but which they reject from indolence only, when they flatter them selves they do it from m odesty. This truth is, m oreover, proved by the daily experience of what passes am ongst m en. For, how do m en becom e judges and arbitr ators in sciences, laws, arts, a nd institutions – in short, in everyth ing which f ills u p their f leeting lif e? Is it not by beginning to m aster, a s far a s they can, the pr incip les which relate to the ir su bject?

The holy rac e of Man, engendered in the Sour ces of adm iratio n, desire, an d inte llig enc e, was, then, established in the region of boundless tim e, like a brilliant orb, that he m ight shed abroad a heavenly light: in short, Man was a be ing , placed between Divinity and the b etray er, who in the spiritual region could produce, at wi ll, explosions of thunde r and lightning, or the serenity of calm s; load the guilty with chains, and cast him into darkness, or im press th e sig ns of consolation and lo ve upon the regions of p eace. - 95 -"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

The first deg ree of this active h ell embraces, so to say, th e whole hum an fa mily, and, in this point of view, there is perhaps not a sing le m an who does not daily the devil' s work, and perhaps that of m any devils at once; though, in th is degree, m en do this work without suspecting it, unknown to them selves. For, it shows no little a ddress on the part of this dem on, thus to keep all m en in his service, and m ake them play what ever parts m ay suit him , and yet feign so well, and by keeping behind the curtain, that, in m aking th em so act at his pleasure, he persuades them that he him self does not exist. This enem y, being spirit, drives all thought of an end out of man' s m ind, by leading him from illusio n to illusion, for he really works m an in spir it, w hile he seems to be ac tin g only in th e outward ord er of things, and because m an, who is spirit, naturally giv es the colour of his own boundless existence to every thing he approaches. This is the way the enemy whom he blindly se rves, leads him on, even to the grave, with projects and passions to which he can see no en d, deceiv ing him alike in his real and in his transient being; this is also the reason why Eternal W isdom , with whom we ought always to dwell, is obliged to withdraw so far from the in fected abode of m an. Ho w, indeed, could Eternal Wisdom dwell am ongst them ? Seeing how they se rve a m aster whom they do not know, and in whom they do not believe; and seeing that, in th eir b lindness, they judge each eth er, corrupt each other, rob ea ch other, f ight and kill e ach othe r.

In the second degree of this active hell, m en also serve the devil, but not unknowingly, as in the preceding degree; they are no longer in doubt or ignorance of his existence; they participate, knowingly, and actively, in his iniquities. Happily, th is class of traitors is the minority, otherwise the world w ould, long since, have sunk unde r the weight of the enem y's abom inations. The divine, or passive hell, com prises every region of sorrow, except that of iniquity. Therefore, anguish succeeds anguish there, like wa ves of the sea. But there, also, one wave swallows up another, so that none h as entire domin ion. On th is accoun t, h ope is still, from time to tim e, known in this hell. In the firs t d egree of the activ e hell, there is, at first, spiritually, neither anguish nor hope; there is nothing but illusion; but under this illusion is the abyss, which soon m akes the sharpness of its bitter sting to be felt. In the secon d degree of this active hell, th ere is nothing but iniquity, there is neither hope nor illusion; the unity of evil is unbroken there. - 103 -"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

The hum an soul forgot this law, when, from its state of splendor, it wandered after a false attraction; b ut this law, which canno t be abrog ated, f ollowed it even into the ea rthly a byss; f or the Principle of all things can produce nothing without im printing its di vine language in it. Idolatry of the Sun Yet, notwithstanding the force of the instruction conveyed in this sym bol, the nations took the letter only of the phenom enon, instead of its spirit; and this is one of the causes in which the idolatry and worship of the sun originated.

Yes, O human soul, this was assuredly the way of Suprem e Love towards you, when He saw that the great calam ities of Nature, which your careles sness had prov oked, had not m ade you wiser. He cam e to you with discom posed l ooks, and, assum ing a threatening tone, rem inded you of those ancient comm andm ents or regulations , on which your own origin and the divine covenant were based; regulations which He published before you, when He gave you being; which He caused Nature again to proclaim , wh en you subjected yourself to her figurative rule; and which m ay, any mom ent, resound in your inm ost being, for you still are, from your origin, the organ of the divine Eterna l Fountain, and what the Eterna l has pronounced once, can never cease to be pronounced through all etern ity. The trad itio ns of all nations afford traces of this watchful pro ceeding of Suprem e Love towards you; from the beginning His way has been, with nations, as with individuals every day, bestirring Him self, by vi olent s ecret move ments, to awaken th em out of their lethargy, and snatch them out of the dangers to which their folli es have exposed them ; it was, in short, in and by this sp irit that Mos es repres ents th e voice of the Most High, publis hing in the m idst of thunders and lightnings, to the Hebrews, this im perative and exclusive divine comm and, which the nations had so forgotten: Thou sh alt have none other Gods before m e.

If there were no legions above, no different degrees of superiority, chiefs, and governm ents, on high, we should have bad none of these institutions ourselves. Man him self, here below, walks under the eye and protecti on of invisible powers, to whom he owes everything, though he scarcely seeks to know them , and hardly believes in them , so taken up is he with his own po wer; yet, if he gets so intoxicated with his own power, it shows that he ought to have power really; he ought to have an em pire, and faithful, obedient subjects. When a sovereign, for instance, or a genera l, sees him self surrounded with his arm ies, and holds brilliant reviews of th em, and feels a secret joy and gl ory in having before him , so many soldiers grandly equipped, and devoted to his orders; when he seem s to say to all spectators: “Not only do all these forces wh ich I command, depend upon m e, but for m e they were created, and to m e they owe all they have”, – they m erely repeat, in a conventional apparent order, what, with the p rim itive Man, ought to ha ve been real, and positive, and perm anent. Man's primitive authority; in what his glory consisted This prim itive Man would also have had legi ons, over which he would have had absolute author ity, by communicating his spirit to th em , as we see a ge neral, so to s peak, pass h is will into the hundred thousand m en he comm ands, m aking th em one with him self, and taking from them , in a m anner, their own wills, to giv e them his only; othe rwise , his control over them would be im possible, and inexplicable. This prim itive Man would likewise have contem plated him self in his legions, and reaped thereby a real glory, because he him self would have counted for so mething in whatever they had; the beau ty o f their arm s; their courag e in defe nding the cause of justice; all m arvels which he could in fact cause to p roceed out of him self, an d spring up in all h is subo rdina tes a t will. Instead of this, here below, his legions com e before hi m already clothed, arm ed, a nd drilled; here, he has not him self always sown what he reaps, since m ost of those he inspects he perhaps never saw, and knows not even their nam es; a species of kno wledge which would have constituted the real streng th of the prim itive Man, as reg ards his coh orts.

But while we are occupied with the sacrifices in use upon th e earth, and their particular signification, spiritual or physic al, we shall see Man fast bound to blood, which seems to be the organ and resort, or abode, of a ll his enem ies here below, the se pulchre of bondage, in which this idolatrous king is buried alive for having s ought to oppose the decrees of Providence, and worshipped strange gods. The law which condem ns m an to bondage, has for aim , to keep him in privation, that privation m ay lead him to repentance, and repent ance to conf ession of his faults; that confession may put hi m in the way that leads to pardon; a nd, as the zealous care of Suprem e W isdom , for this unhappy exile, is inexhaustibl e, it provided him with m eans to cure the evils he is daily exposed to from the hands of his enem ies, and to preserve him self from their attacks; and, lastly, it pro vided h im with m eans of consolation in hi s m isery; and we will here endeavour to show that this was the spirit of the ins titutio n of sacrifices, how absurd or im pious soever those cerem onies m ay have be com e in passing through the hands of m en, and falling under the control of the very enem y they were intended to expel. Unities of action in the Universe and Nature A positive a nd well-kno wn law, which I here re trace to the friends of wisdom , as one of the m ost useful lights in their course, is, that, notwithstanding the innum erable diversities of creatures an d classes which com pose the univers e, there are ce rtain uni ties of action which em brace entire classes, and act upon the ind ividu als of those classes, by n atural analo gy. This is why, in all productions of Nature, there are genera, sp ecies , fam ilies, all bearing the im press of this unity of ac tion, each accord ing to its class. The powers and faculties of our m inds m ay be said to present the sam e law, showing a sort of uniform ity in the move ments of m en's thoughts, and reducing all their system s to a lim ited number of theorem s and axiom s, and all th eir institutions to fundam ental formulas, which hardly vary from each other. The m edicinal ar t, morals, politics, delib erative and scientific assem blies, things belonging to the religious orde r, and, if I m ay say so, even to the infernal order, all testify in fa vour of this principle. By this law of unity of action, the sam e phys ical action which rules in the blood of man, rules in that of anim als also, because th e bodies o f both are of the sam e order.

If these different individuals, m en and anim als, are subje ct to the sam e laws, in the disorders to which they are exposed, they also pa rticipate in the perfectio ns of the unity of the regular action which governs them ; and, if derang em ent is common to both, restoration m ust be so equally, from whence both the spirit and the us e of sacrifices m ay be presum ed; but this would not be sufficient, if we c ould not also find out, how these sa crifice s operate in them selves, and how their results can affect m an. Reason of Sacrifices; their spiritual operation The Hebrew law tells us that there are an im als which are clean, and others which are unclean. Jacob Boehm e gives a positive reason f or this, in th e two tinc tures, which were in harm ony before crim e, and were subdivided in the great change. Nature is not opposed to this, since we recognize a distinction in anim als, som e being useful, others m ischievous. So that even in a m ere physical sense, the m eaning of Scripture would be borne out. But, what if it had a spiritual m eaning? And, in truth, as m atter has only a life of dependence, and it has existence, virtues, and properties, only through the different spirituous action s or in fluences, by which it is engendere d, com bined, constitu ted, an d characterized; being, moreover, th e continu al receptacl e of powers opposed to order, which ten d only to stamp their mark of irregularity and confusion everywhere; it is not surprising that this m atter sho uld presen t the types and play of all thes e diverse and opposite actions or influences, of which we see melancholy evidences in ourselves. Thus, when m an has fallen under som e disorder ly influence, the clean anim al m ight be a means of deliver ing him from it; the disorde rly a ction be ing attracted by the bas is her e presen ted to it, over w hich it m ay ha ve certain rights and power. But, for this attraction not to prolong the c onsequences and ef fects of this disorderly influence, it is necessary, in the first p lace, that the anim al's blood be shed; secondly, th at th is anim al, though clean by nature, should receive som e extra preservative influence, because it is com posed of m ixed elem ents, and exposed to the disorganizing influe nce of the enemy, like every thing else that is m atter. Now the preservative action, in this case, was represented, am ong the Hebrews, by the im position of the priest' s hands , on the head of the victim , the priest him self repres enting Man rein sta ted in h is first righ ts; an d such is th e spirit of the se two laws. By the shedding of the anim al's blood, the diso rderly a ction a ttach ed to man' s m atter, is more forcibly attracted o utwards, than by the mere bodily p resence of the anim al, because, the nearer we co me to the principle, the more ener getic and efficacious are al l its relation s, in any order whatever.

This, it seem s to m e, gi ves a general view of the spirit of the institution o f sacrif ices. This view of the subject m ay help us to disc over the particular spirit which ordered the details of all the Hebrew sacrifices; those, for instance, for sin and expiation; those called peace offerings; and even those of atonem ent, or re conciliation, and m an's uni on with God, confirm ed by the sensible signs of their allian ce. Sacrifice for sin This sim ple law of transposition, of which we have been speaking, is sufficient to give us an idea of th e spir it of th e sacr ifice for sin, – casting out defilem ent into the regions of disorder, and upon the enem y who caused it. Peace offering The object o f the sacrifice for p eace, would seem to be to g ive streng th to m an to resist that en em y, and even to prevent h is attack s. The preparation of the vi ctim, by the im position of the priest' s hands, m akes this in tellig ible, sin ce it places a pure blood which is in conjunction with regular influences, in pr oxim ity with a blood which is surrounded with destructive and maleficent influences, and is thereby able to rest ore calm and repose. A great m any of the details of the sacrificial cerem onies wa rrant our confidence in these c onjectures. The blood poured round the altar, and applied to the four corners, the sprinklings of blood, the eating the victim , etc., all strik ingly refer to a work of peace and p reservation. The perpetual, and the consecrati on sacrifi ces As to the perpetual sacrifices, and those or dain ed for the cons ecr ation of priests-the spiritual purport of which was, to unite the pon tiff with God, – their law will enab le us to arrive at its own meaning; but this ki nd of sacrifices was not institut ed for all m en, but only for those called by God, by a particular el ection, to His own service. Such m en, prepared by their very election, we re in connection with the higher virtues ; these higher virtues, em bracing all things, are al ways united with those regular actions which watch over our blood, to clear it from disorder.

All that happened to Abraham , whe n he s acr ificed the an im als divid ed in two; what happened to Aaron, on the eighth da y of his consecration; to Da vid, on the threshing-floor of Ornan; what took place in the Tem ple, after the high priest' s sacrifices, sufficiently indicate the object, and the power which the really sacred sacr ifices had, when perform ed by the Lord' s elect, who exercis ed, in a m easure, suitab le to the epoc h, the Spir itua l Ministry of Man. From these few observations on the sacrifices of blood in general, it follows that their object was to develop certain pure and regular inf luences ( actions ) which, uniting with m an, might help him to rise out of his abyss, to the regions of regularity and order. Anathem as and exter minations, their reaso ns and operation In an opposite direction, but tending to the sa me end, the interdict or anathem a operated, spoken of in the last chapter of Leviticus. W hat was consigned, by this sort of consecration, to the jus tice o f the Lord, was, appare ntly, th e se at of what was m ost irregular and abom inable, which, therefore, m ight be m ost fa tal to the chosen people. Thus, all these subjects o f anathem a had to be ex term inated, that the ir reg ular inf luence or action which was in them , finding no m ore to rest upon, should be com pelle d to depart, and be no m ore able to injure the people. We m ay here learn not to find fault with th e punishment of Achan, the execution of Agag by Sa muel, and the rejection of Saul, who wished to save this condem ned and im pious king; and even all thos e ordained m assacres re lated in Scripture, of entire ci ties, with all the ir inhabitan ts, which appear so revo ltin g to those w ho are not prepared, o r are little fam iliar with profound truths, and especially those with whom the material body is every th ing, whereas God counts souls only. Why the innocent fall with the guilty; extermination of animals This class of persons are far from suspecting the great secret, spoken of in “L' Esprit des Choses”, by which the Divinity frequently perm its the inno cent to f all with the guilty, in plagues, or catastrophes of Nature, that they m ay, by th eir purity, preserve them from greater corruption, as we cover with salt the m eats we woul d preserve, which, otherwise, would putrefy. In a word, it is in this intent of rem oving the bases of poison, that we m ay discover the reason why, in the conquest of th e Prom ised Land, the Jews were so frequently ordered to exterm inate, even to th e anim als, because, in th is case, th e dea th of anim als infected with the im pure influences of those nations, preserved the chosen people from the poison; whereas, in the sacrifices, th e death of clean anim als attract ed wholesom e and preservative influences.

Blood of cl ean animals, the seat of good influences in bondage This does not m ean that the pure and regular virtues are shut up and buried in the blood of anim als, as som e have thought, w ho, like the Hindoos, believe that all kinds of spirits ledge and abide th ere; it p resum es si mply that thos e pu re and regular influences are attached to certain classes and individuals of these anim als, and that, by breaking the bases in which they are fixed, they m ay becom e useful to m an; it is in this se nse we should read the passage “It is the blood that maketh atonem ent for the soul” (L ev. xvii. 11); for we m ust not confound the fleshly soul, and, therefore, th e soul of anim als, with the regul ar external actions by which they are governed. But from this species of bondage or constraint, in which this kind of actions or influences is, there results another conse quence, justified beforehand by the painful state or sort of reprobation under which m an is, and which announces him to be a-crim inal. This consequence is, that if m an requires all these actions to be set free, before he can begin to recover his own libe rty; if , in a word, he is the object f or whom th is law is put in operation, he m ust him self have been for som ething in the revolution which enthralled them .

Thus we see in the Hebrew traditions, the Je ws being, as it w ere, the firstborn of people, that Pharaoh' s prevarications and hardness of h eart com pelled Justice to strike, not him only, but all the firstborn of his ki ngdom , of beasts as well as of m en; the son of the slave, as well as the son of hi m that sat upon the throne. - 122 -"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns. Edward B.

This coincidence is a further indication of what we have advanced, as to the aim and spirit of the sacrifices; f or, the cons ecration of th e pries t, which seem s to com bine in itself the m eaning of all other consecrations, was not m ade wi thout the sacrifice of a ram. If we followed up this comparison, we should see that, by m an's crim e, all the firstborn, all produced principles of every kind, were burie d with him in his abyss; but that, through the never-failin g love of Suprem e W isdom , he received power to resto re th em successiv ely to their rank, and then his fellowcreatures, in their turn ; and m ake s ouls enjoy their sabbaths, as he had power to m ake Nature enjoy hers. We should see, in a word, that the bloody sacrif ices tended to that double object, whether by resto ring their orig ina l lib erty to a ll thos e pur e and regular actions, whic h sin had attached to the different classes of anim als and created thing s, or thereby enabling them to bring relief to man, and de liver him from the th raldom in which he languishes. The Exodu s, a dou ble type, founded on the nature of Man For, in the exam ple we have just quoted, we m ust always consider that its object was Man; only w e m ust observe that its double types apply to two distinct na tions, the Egyptians and the Hebrews, one of which represents Man in his fall and state of reprobation, and the other under his law of deliverance and m e turn toward s the sublime post from which he descended. We do not, however, take the Hebrew laws and custom s for the ground and foundation on which this theory res ts. It rest s, in th e first p lace, on the natu re of Man as he was in his origin, and as he is at present, that is, on our greatn ess and our wretchedness; and when, afterwards, it finds on earth testim onies which support and confir m it, it m akes use of them , not as proofs, but as confirm ations. Theref ore, we need not ref er to the s acred wr itin gs, to f ind out the tim e when sacrif ices origin ated. The sacrifices of glory date from an epoch anteri or to the fall of m an: as for the bloody and expiato ry sacrifices, they commenced as soon as guilty m an began to see the way of deliverance open before him , and that was when he was permitted to com e to inhab it the ear th; since, being previously swallowed up like an infa nt, in an abyss, he could have no matter for sacrif ice at h is dispos al, not having the use of his facultie s.

Thus, m an's connection with Nature was nothing but suffering, and his being, him self, so to say, id entif ied with the pow er of darkness. At length, w hen the way to return was opened to him , these salu tary m eans ( sacrifices ) could operate only through the organ or channel of Nature, in w hich he was buried, instead of being its ruler. Thus the relations ( rapports ) he h as with anim als will not en d, till Natur e have f ulfille d her course; bu t these relation s vary in their characte r, accord ing to the differen t epochs in which m an is placed. In his tim e of glory, he reigned as a sovereign over anim als; and, if we m ay presum e that there w ere sacrifices in that epoch, their obj ect could not have been m an's restoration, for he was not guilty. When he fell he becam e the victim of these an im als, and of all Nature. At the tim e of his delive rance, he wa s perm itted and enabled to em ploy them for his advancem ent: this cannot be doubted , after what has been said. Now, these foundations being thus laid on a firm basis, it is satisfactory to find them fully confirm ed in the sacred writings. Spiritual signification and corresp ondence of Mosaic Sacrifices The first m an, in his state of glory, is, in the Scriptures, shown to have been invested with entire autho rity ove r Nature, par ticularly over anim als; since it was given to him to apply to them their essen tial and con stituent nam es; af ter his fall the earth w as cursed, and enm ity was placed between the wom an and the serpent; but we hardly see m an sent to till the ground, before we find sacrifices of anim als in use in his fam ily, a str ong indication that he pract ised them hi mself, and that he tran smitted the pr actice to h is child ren, from whom it a fterwards sp read ove r th e whole earth. It is easy to see how advantage ous th is ins titution , so salutary in its p rincip le and in its object, would have been to m an, if he had observed it in its true spirit; we have only to look at the sacrifices restored in the tim e of Moses, to acknowledge that, if the people had observed them faithfully, they would never have been abandoned, but would have drawn upon them selves every good thing they w ere then capable of rece iving, since divine light and power would have surrounded them always. The f irst th ing to rem ark, in the rules rela ting to these sac rifices, is, th at they were, by far, most num erous and im portan t at the three g reat Hebrew festivals : the Passover, th e Feast of Weeks, and the Feas t of Tabernacles. These thre e solem n epochs, so instructive from the facts which they recall, the fix ed periods at which they were held, and the conne ction they h ave with the spiritual history and regene ration of m an, clearly show how im portant the sac rifice s then celebrated must have been, since it is natural to suppose they had to concur in the developm ent of those great objects.    -    124    -"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns. Edward B. Pen ny The better to perceive the conn ection of these thr ee princ ipal f estiv als with the spiritual history of the regenerati on of m an, we m ust look continually at our own nature, and observe that, as we are ch aracterized s piritually by three k ingdom s, or em inent constit uent faculties, which require as m any develop ments in each of the thre e orders, earthly, spiritual, and div ine, through which we pass, it is certain that all the m ean s and laws which cooperate for our regeneration, must follow a course confor mable with this num ber, and analogous to the kind of assistance we require, according to our states of developm ent and the work of their respective epochs. Digression on numbers But, lest the word num ber should alarm the r eader, I will s top an inst ant to observe to him that num bers, though fixed in the natural order, are nothing in themselves, and serve only to express the properties of things. Just as, in our languages, words serve only to express ideas, and have essentially no value in them selves. But som e ha ve thought that, as num bers expre ssed the properties of things, they really contain ed th ese properties them selves : th is has been the c ause of so m uch delusive credit, and so much discre dit, a ttach ing to th e science of num bers, in which, as in a thousand other instances, the form has swallowed up the substance; whereas num bers can no m ore have existence or value, without the properties th ey represent, than a word can be worth anything, without the idea of which it is the sign. But here there is a difference, nam ely, th at our ideas, being va riab le, th e words we em ploy to express them m ay vary also; whereas, th e properties of things being fixed, num bers, or the figures which represent them , cannot be liable to change. Mathem atics, although f ar from recognizing a nd em ploying these fixed num bers, give an idea of them in the free o r arbitrary n umbers whic h they m ake use of; for they continually apply these arbitrary num bers to the values of what th ey speculate upon, and when they are so applied, they are nothing m ore than their signs and representatives; separa te them , and they are nothing. But pure m athem atics, abstractedly of all application, is an i nvention of our own. Nature knows nothing of this sort of m athe matics. Nature is the con tinu al union of geom etrical laws, with fixed, though unknown numbe rs. Man m ay, in his m ind, consider these laws independently of their fixed numbers; but Nature is the ef fective ex ecution of th ese laws, and knows no abstractions. Now, as mathem aticians concern them selves only with external m ove ments and dim ensions of things, and not with th eir inward p roperties, it is certain that they need n ot be troubled about the fixed num bers, which are only signs of these properties. And, in fact, as they have m erely to do with the visible dim ensions of things, or at most, th eir approxim ate weight, velocity, and attraction, it is clea r that, to attain thei r object, the ordinary num eration suffices. What I have just said on num bers is suffici ent to rem ove the prejudice which generally waits upon this order of knowledge, and I return to our subject, sacrifice. - 125 -"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

The Hebrews did not, it is true, a t th at tim e of fer sacrif ices; f or, lik e m an, in the f irst act of his deliverance, they were st ill in a state of impotence, and ignorant that their law was acting upon them unknown to them selves, as it acts on an infant when it is just born into the world. Nevertheless, they killed a lam b in ever y house; and though this was not done accord ing to the form of sacrifice which was institu ted afterwards, th ere was in th is cerem ony an efficacious virtu e initiatory of what was to follo w; thus, at that great epoch, we see four im - portant things com e to the front at once, nam ely, Man' s call to terr estria l lif e, the deliv erance of the chosen people, the birth of Nature in spri ng, and the shedding of blood of anim als ; and these four things could not coincide in so rem arkab le a way without having an inward correspondence. The lamb It m ust be observed that the slaughter of the lam b was the preparatory act, anterior to the delivery of the Hebrews; and from this we m ay presum e how pure and regular were the influences attached to this species of anim al, when set free by its slaughter, since they were respected by the des troying angel, an d becam e the m eans of protection o rdained by God to preserve the Hebrews from the sword of justice. This brings us, with sufficient evidence, to what we said before, that blood is m an's sepulchre, from which he m ust necessarily be delivere d, to ta ke the f irst step in the great line of Lif e. It sho ws likewise that, of all a nim als, the lam b has the widest and most useful rapports to man's deliverance and regeneration, a nd that its sacrifice was the one from which he might derive the greatest advantage, by its disposing him , by t he secret virtues of the s acr ifice, the more surely and gloriously, to go out of his own blood.

The Lair, its spiritual correspondence: secon d epoch We see this first epoch f ollowed by a second, in which the Hebrews received the Law , on Mount Sinai. All the relations nam ed a bove will be found also in this epoch. After we are called into terres trial lif e, there is an age at which the sp irit first joins us, and communicates its first rays to us . After the first m an was plucke d out of the abyss into which crim e had plunged him , and he had obtained, th rough the death of Abel and repentance, an entrance into the ways of justi ce, he received consolation, indi cated by the advent of his son Seth, who drew down upon his fam ily the first de posit of those gifts, wh ich Suprem e Mercy still deigns to grant to m ankind.

We know that the Law was given to the Hebrew people, forty-nine days after the passage of the Red Sea; we know that this epoch falls at the tim e of the first fruits, and that the festival which was institu ted in r eference to it was cal led the Feas t of W eeks, and of First Fruits. Finally, we know that th is law was sprinkl ed with the blood of sacrifices and peace offerings, taken from the large cattle, or calves (Exod. xxiv. 5).

In this epoch, the bl ood of calves was shed; in the first, it was only that of lam bs. In the first epoch, which was that of deliver ance only, the blood of the lamb served as organ in the work of m ercy, which was wrought upon the people, and was indicated by the meekness of which this a nim al is the sym bol; f or, in the app arent cha racters of the anim als, we may obtain glim pses of the influences which rule in them , and of the works in which they have to take p art, in th e designs of W isdom. In the second epoch, the people being in the wilderness, on the way b ack to their country, required m ore strength to resist their enem ies; a nd everything leads us to believe that the blood of large cattle, shed on th is occas ion, indicates that this was th e object of the sacrifice of this class of victim s. In the first epoch, the people had nothing to do; they had m erely to follow the spirit which did everything for them , as a mother or a nur se does f or a child in its tender age: and there was no law then. In the second epoch, the people are considered as being able to act for them selves; and then the law was given to them ; then its precep ts were taugh t, by which to regulate th eir conduct through the arduous journeys which were before them . It was natural, therefore, that the sam e wisdom , which dictated the laws, should also communicate the strength needful for their observan ce, and the sacrifice of calves points to this; to say nothing, here, of the spiritual strength derived from wi tnessing the prodigies wrought before them on the m ountain, nor that which th ey m ight expect from the ordination of their priests, which was subsequent to the prom ulgation of the law, and the em ancipation of the people, and m ay be regarded as com pleting and consolidating this second epoch: Moses was ordained directly, without intervention of any man' s m inistry; for he was to be as God to Pharaoh, and take Aaron for his prophet (Ex. vii.).

The Feast of Tabernacles prophetic of the future advent of the Spiritual Kingdom Now this f estiva l, the m ost im portant of all, from the num ber of victim s offered, was the figurative and prophetic expression of the benefits which awaited the people in the tim es to com e, but of which they could have no id ea, because those tim es had not yet arrived.

Law of Sacrifices continued A second fundam ental truth, connected with wh at we have said above, may be stated here; nam ely, that under the law of sacrifices , everything was done by transpositions, because man was too far from the truth fo r it to unite with him directly. The brazen s erpent, the o blations, the sacrif ices, even the jou rneyings of the Hebrew people, are s ufficien t evidences th at s uch was the character of that law; this becom es m anifest, when it is seen that m an being connected, through crim e, with divided, though analogous influences ( actions ), could be delivered from this painfu l division, only by th e re-union of these analogies. But this law, as it advanc es, seem s to beco me m ore and m ore profitable to the chosen people, who m ust be recognized as the type of man. Accordingly, as we have before observed, we see a pro gression of favours, activ ity, and g race, succeed s that of festiv als and epo chs; and the perpetual sacrifice, whilst serving as a comm emorati on of the deliverance out of Egypt, showed at th e sam e tim e, the continu al watchf ulness of Suprem e Love over His people, whom He will neve r forsake. The extraordinary holocausts which were added at the thre e great f estiva ls, were to b ring down upon the people, such active virtues as co rresponded with the plans of these different epochs; for we there see bulls, ram s, seven lam bs – independently of all the other offerings which were always added to the bu rnt sacr ifices.

The Hebrew nam es do not help to throw m uch light on this great subject. These nam es are active only when applied to m en, to the genera tions of the chosen people, and their m inisters, as we see by the characteristic nam es of the pa triarchs and prophets, because Man was the chief object of this process of electi on and restoration; whereas, the tim e for Na ture' s great restoration not being yet com e, the nam es of plants and anim als proceed no further in Hebrew, than in other languages, and their true nam es are still buried in what Jacob Boehm e calls the language of Nature till th e seals b e op ened. We m ight enlarge upon the general idea we ha ve expressed above, nam ely, that in the frightful overthrow of Nature, on the occasion of the crim inal lapse of Man, som e substances, mineral, vegetable, or anim al, were better preserve d than oth ers; th at is, th ey retained a greater proportion of the living and powerful properties of their first estate; a nd that, doubtless, these will have b een what wer e used in pr eference in the sacr ifices and other ce rem onials of worship, as being bes t able to ren der serv ice to m an, s eein g that they r emained nearest to the p rim itive covenant: b ut this wou ld require a more extens ive knowled ge on our part, of the prim itive state of things; and we m erely allude to it. Circumcisi on, its reason and effects Let us now consider an objection which m ay be raised, to the key we offer for the explanation of the sacrifices. If sacrifices operated for m an, by me ans of their correspondences; if the shedding of the blood of victim s was the established m eans for effecting this object; it m ay be asked how it happens that circum cision would not answer instea d of sacrifice? For, the blood of m an him self being shed, it m ight be supposed it w ould operate more efficaciously for h im, than that of any other victims, by reason of the superiority of its correspondences. W e m ay reply as follows: The VIRT UE of sacri fices deri ved through faith If the bloody sacrifices acted through their correspondences , still they derived their virtue, radically, through the desire of the m inister, and that of the believer who joined him ; for then, the divine desire itself unite d with theirs. N ow, as this de sire, which is real faith, cannot, under any circum stances, do without a ground or basis, the blood of animals served for this, and assisted it to reach a h igher gr ound, till it could rest on th e perfect basis, the Divine Heart, which - 131 -"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns. Edward B. Pen ny ruled, in secret, all the sacrifices , and would crown them in the end. One faith; diversity of forms We m ay rem ark, en passant, that the necessity of a basis on which to rest our true faith or desire, is the key to all the dive rsities of sacrifices, whether blo ody or otherwise, as well as to idol worship, and every other ki nd of worship in honour on the earth; in all of which we see that nations have the sam e faith, and are m istaken only on the basis; but, th e choice of this basis being so im portant, – since it should have fixed correspondences with a tr ue centre, natural, spiritual, or divine, – and nations err so greatly in this r espec t, it is not su rpris ing th at their darkness should be so universal. Circumcisi on, not a basi s of faith; only an initiation Now circumcision could not serve as basis for this faith or de sire, since it was perform ed only a few days after birth; and if, on Abraham , it was performed at m ature age, it was only because this patriarch wo uld not have been chosen as a child, to be the chief of the elect race, and he had moreover, to enter free ly into th e allia nce. Beside s, he therein represented only the first degrees of his reconciliation. However, though a child can have no true faith or desire, m an's blood, shed at the circum cision of infants, had no doubt an effect; but this was lim ited, so to speak, to perfor ming in them a sort of ablutio n, like cu ttin g them off , in som e sort, from this system of blood into which m an's crim e plunged us, and in itiating them thereby into the active and efficacio us work in which their faith or desire would som e day em ploy them voluntarily. It was, m oreover, rather a figurative effect of the great circumcision, their corporeal deliver ance, than posse ssing in itself any vivifying regenerative power, like the holocaust s in which faith had at least som e influence, in which a pure victim was slain, and in which the entire developm ent of all correspondences of regular influences acted in rest oring m an, partially at least, to his rights and enjoym ents. Moreover, we have seen that m an's deat h was the only bloody sacrifice which could restore him to the fulness of his relations, and pe rfect way of return to his relations, and perfect way of return to his Principle. Therefore, as the principle of anim al life was not cut off by circum cision, the observance of this law could not, in itself, bring down upon him any powerful resto rative influences ; and, if the blo od of an im als (slain) had not been su bstitu ted for his (in circum cision), he would have rem ained th rough life in the sam e privation and bondage. At the sam e tim e, as we have said, this ci rcum cision was not useless, since it was a sort of initiation into deg rees which m an c ould not ye t enjoy. But, precis ely because it was an initiation, it was necessary it shou ld m ake hi m ca pable of receiving its p rogressiv e fruits, and it really acco mplished th is for him , by opening his blood to all the regu lar influences which the sacrifices of anim als could bring to him. Therefore, when divine authority co nsecrated this principle, which was, perhaps, already - 132 -"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns. Edward B. Pen ny in use am ongst other people, – but not applied by th em to its true object – and ordained it as one of the holy laws of the Jewish people, this cerem ony was then so strictly prescribed. Then, all who were uncircum cised were excluded from th e sacrifices b ecause the regular influ ences, which those sacrifices attracted, finding no way open to reach their principle of life, would have acted forcibly and with v iolence against thes e brea kers of the law, and exterm inated them in the midst of the people. Before and after the Deluge It would follow from this, that, as circ um cision seem s to have been practised only subsequently to the Deluge, all sacrifices, m ade previously to that ev ent, m ust have been fruitle ss. Now, if we have no proof s that this p ractice was in use bef ore the Deluge, n eithe r have we any to th e contrary; and, adm itting that it be gan after th e Deluge, all difficulty disappears, when we reflect on the d ifference of states in which m ankind were at these different epochs: a ref lection which applies to anim als a s well. Before the Deluge, Man enjoyed all the power s of his animal corpo real nature ; th is tem porary covering given to him as an organ for the higher influences a nd virtues which are so needful to him, was m ore in acco rdance with th e plan appoin ted for his restoration ; an d, being consequently m ore open to the healing influences , he m ight not require circum cision for them to gain access to him . On the other hand, as anim als then enjoyed a gr eater am ount of life than they have since, their blood would be more efficacio us, and this would render the assistan ce of circu mcision less necessary th an it becam e at the secon d epoch. At this second epoch, everything was changed. All Nature had been tortured and altered by the calamity of the Deluge. Mankind, whose crim es had dr awn down this Deluge, becam e much m ore bound by the chains of m atter; the anim als themselves lost virtuality in the renewal of their species, which brought them lower than th ey were before this explosion of the vengeance of Supre me Justice. In short, what reflections do not those en orm ous m ammoth skeletons lead to? If W isdom had not provided fo r m an, m eans to re medy these fatal resu lts o f justice, h e would have continued w ithout any wa y of return to his Principle, a nd the plan of divine Love in favour of mankind would have been unfulfilled, s ince th e first initiation in to this p ath could not have taken p lace. N ow, from all that we have seen, circum cis ion appears to have been the means, which, af ter the Deluge, sup plied the ad vantages which m en and anim als had enjoyed before that catastrophe. Perhaps, even, if the people had faithfully observed the laws and instruction which Noah, as the elect and chosen of God, transm itted to th em , they m ight have con tinued under sufficiently powerful conditions, for this new m edium to have been unnecessary. But, by the of fence of Ham and Canaan, and th e abom inations comm itted in the p lain s of - 133 -"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns. Edward B. Pen ny Shinar, they added m ore chains to those whic h the Deluge had put upon them, and aggravated the obstacles which already opposed their re-union with their Sour ce. It would not, then, be astonishing if the unquenchable love which created them , foll owed th em even into the abyss into which they sank, and offered them a ne w route whereby to return to Him . Let us re turn to the three e pochs, and we shall see them re traced in m iniature, in the account given of circum cision am ongst the Hebrews. Jewish circumcision : first period, under Abraham It is under A braham that we first hear of circumcision in th e S crip tures ; th e Lord confirm ing thereby His alliance with him and his posterity. U nder what circum stances was this circum cision commanded by the Lord? It was wh en He gave a new nam e to Abraham , and one also to his wife, by adding to their old nam es, a single letter o f the sacred nam e by which He first made hi mself known to Moses. It was when he wa s ninety-nine years old, just after he had m ade a covenant with him , prom ising hi m the land of Canaan; in short, it was when He first chose to Hi mself a people, in whom all generations should be blessed. All these things, again, taken t ogether, show that circum cisi on had an initiatory virtue into all the benefits which God prepared for His people, all w hich would have been w ithout effect if He had not opened this way to their fulfilm ent. Abraham had received, howe ver, div ine favours previously to this cerem ony; he had been taken out of his own country, where iniquity had entered; he had built altars to the Lord at Bethel, and invoked His nam e; he had been blessed by Melchizedek; and, in the bloody sacrifice which he offered by God' s c omm and, he had received evidences of th e Spirit' s presence; bu t this nowise co ntrad icts th e principles we have estab lished. Abraham was the elect of the Lord, although he was born amongst idolaters, and som e accuse h im of having traded in ido ls. His heart may have rem ained pure, even thoug h his spirit may have be en given up to the sam e darkness which covered his contem poraries. Thus the divine favou rs m ay have found access to him , without the secondary m eans of circumcision. Besides, we must m ake an essential d istinction between the m eans em ployed by God to manifest an election, and those used f or bringing that election to its term . We shall see them always forming two classes in all subsequent el ections and epochs; we ha ve a positive proof of this in Abraham' s election, since, notwithstandi ng all the favours of which he was recipient, before his circum cision, it was only after he and a ll his household had been obedient to this law, that he received three an gels as gue sts; tha t the tim e for the birt h of Isaac was clearly fixed; and that, at the end of the year, he receiv ed this promised Son, through whom the covenan t, which began with Abraham , was to be r ealized and f ulfilled. Nothing m ore is needed to convince us th at, at the tim e we first hear circum cision mentioned, it was intend ed as an in itiation into a ll the benefits prom ised in the election; and as such, it b ear s a sensib le rela tion to what we have said of the P assover, or the first epoch of the Hebrews' return to the prom ised land. - 134 -"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns. Edward B. Pen ny Second period; under Moses The second tim e circum cision is m entioned in Scripture is under Moses (E x. iv. 25), where it is to be presumed this ceremony bad been neglected, and that this was the cause of the angel' s anger, inasm uch as circum cision was ag ain prescribed , with al l the other laws and ordinances, on the m ountain (Lev. xii. 3); which leads us to cons ider this law of circum cision, given on the m ountain, and that perform ed on Mose s' son, as constitu ting b ut one and the sam e epoch. The tim e when this law r eappear ed is rem arkable f or its conf orm ity with what passed under Abraham . It was after Moses saw the burning bush and received God' s prom ise that the people should be delivered; it was after he had been him self chosen to be the instrument of this deliverance, and received the m ost extraordinary signs of his m ission, that the divine vengeance, about to fall upon his son, was a rrested by Zipporah' s subm ission; la stly, it was at the mom ent of Moses' return to Egypt to commence his m ission, that this cerem ony was perform ed on his son. This com parison shows clearly that this cer em ony was to serve as an initiation to the fruits of the prom ised deliverance, as it did, under Abraham , to the fruits of his election; and that neither of them could be attained without she dding of blood. W e m ust pay no attention to the difference that the son' s blood, in Moses' case, wa s shed, and not that of the patriarch him self; for, although the two individuals were distinct, their blood may be considered as one; there are besides, und er th is veil, innum erable rela tions of other truth s, which penetrating eyes will discover without difficulty. Thus, without m y undertaking to expose these truths, there will be seen therein a m iddle epoch, a double circum cision, a com memoration of the sacrifice of Abraham' s son, and a prophecy of another sacrifice, of which it is not tim e to speak ye t. W e m ust, then, be content with observing that this election of Moses, and the circum cision which attended it, aim ing at the living f irstf ruits of the p rom ise m ade to Abraha m, connect the mselv es quite natur ally with the second epoch, or second of the Hebrew festivals, in which the earth re ndered her first produce, and the people received the first-fruits of the Spir it, which a re the Law; be cause, in the se com - parisons, it should never be forgo tten that every trinary of epochs m akes a circle, and that every preced ing circle is a deg ree less elev ated th an its successo r. Circumcision, third period, unde r Joshua: its correspondences Finally, the third tim e the ordinance of ci rcum cision appears in Scripture, is under Joshua, when the people are about to enter the prom ised land (Josh. v. 2). This ordinance had not been kept during the forty years the people journeyed in th e wilderness; and those who had been circumcised in Egypt ha d all perished; so God revive d it for all who rem ained uncircum cised, in order “that the reproach of Egypt should be take n from off the people”; and all the people were circum cised in Gilgal. - 135 -"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

But what shows how advantageous circum cisio n was on this occasion is , that after th at cerem ony manna ceased to fall, and the people began to eat of the fruits of the country; that Joshua entered under the direct protection of thc visible Prince of the Lord' s hosts; that the trum pets of jubille becam e the chief weapons of the people, and at their sound, accompanied with that of the W ord, or speech ( parole ) the walls of Jericho were ovcrthrown, and every m an was able to enter s traigh t bef ore him into th e ci ty; all figures of what wa s in rese rve fo r m an at subsequent epochs, and what aw aits us when we are out of our m ixed and earthly circle. Efficacy of Sacrifi ces down to the destru ction of Jerusale m Here it is, es pecially, th at the power and e fficacy of sacrifices are seen; for all the wonders we have m entio ned were preceded, not by circum cision only, b ut also by th e burnt sacrifices of Passover which th e p eople celebrated at Gilgal , and probably also those which Moses and the elders recomm ended when they should enter into the la nd of prom ise (Deut. xxvii), and which the b ook of Joshua does not mention till after the con of Ai (viii. 30), but which, it m ay be presumed, were offered after th e passage of Jordan, as Moses had comm anded. We will not recap itulate what we have said of the efficacy of these sac rific es, confirm ed by the wonderful successes which followed them ; it is sufficient to have once established as a principle the relation which blood ha s with the orderly influences ( actions ), and that which these have with the higher influences , to understand the a dvantage which m an, or the chosen people, might derive from these cerem onies, in respect to their de liver ance and pro gress towa rds the term of their true libe rty.

Practice of Sacrifice amongst other nations; its cor uption r It is eviden t that the use of these ceremonies am ongst other n ations is not to be attributed to the Jewish religion, nor to the sacrifices on which it was grounded, because the Jews were an exclus ive an d isolated people, who held no in tercourse with o ther nations ; because they have ceased to ex ist as a peop le only under our era, an d since then only have th ey lost the u se of their cerem onies and sacrifices; m oreover, sacrifices, having been in use from the beginning of the world, when the world w as renewed after the Del uge, their revival am ong all nations is no m ore to be wondered at than the dispersio n of thes e nations, who will have carried with th em the custom s and cerem onies of their fath ers. It is not, therefore, the un iversal prevalence of sacrifices which should now surprise and occupy us, for, as they are known to originate on natural grounds, all their ram ifications can have no other origin; but the changes which these stream s or branches have undergone in their course are what m ust now be the object of our reflection and researches. This corrupt change could never have happene d if there had been no pure spring to begin with; and those who have attributed the use of s acrifices to mere ignora nce and superstition, have confounded the abuse and the consequences w ith the principle, and thereby precluded them selves from knowing either the principle o r the consequ ences. Let us never forget the unhappy situation of m an in this world of sorrow and darkness, exem plified by the sufferings of all m ortals, and the tears of all ages. Let us not forget that, if we are surrounded by regular influences, of which clean anim als are m edium s, we are also surrounded by disorderly inf luences, which inces santly tend to introduce disorder into everyt hing that approaches us, that it m ay invade and enter ourselves, and delay our return towa rds the ligh t. This picture, unhappily too true already, to our cost, becom es still m ore so when we call to m ind the sacerdotal p reparation s which the vi ctim s underwent, according to th e Jewish law; and especially when we rem ember the fowls which cam e down upon the carcases, on the occasion of Abraham' s sacrifice, and th at this patriarch drove them away. It is not to be supposed that, in the multitude of sacrifices that were offered, whether in the fam ily of Noah, or under his descendants wh o peopled the earth, nothing of these sacerdotal preparations was ever wanting, and that the fowl s were always driven aw ay from the victim s; this, I say, cannot be supposed, when we see abom ination m ake its appearance in the bosom of the fam ily of Noah hi mself, and his posterity enve loped in darkness to such a degree, as to oblige Suprem e W isdom to m ake a new election.

At another tim e, without interf ering with the v ictim s, it will have urged th e sacrificer to address to itself the spirit and intention of his worship, leadin g him to hope for greater profit thereby than he could expect fr om a severe and jealous Being, who withdrew all His favour for the slightest negligence in the ce remonies which He had instituted ; and, by flattering his cupidity in every wa y, this disor derly inf luence will h ave attached him to itse lf, and drawn him into the most fatal abuses and monstrous abom inations.

The m anifold form s which the disord erly influence was able to assum e, in order to alter the sacrifices and le ad Man astray, were the chief source of material idolatry, the officiators who received such m anifestation s being led, by a natural proclivity, to ho nour anim als or other natural substances to which those form s, assum ed by the disorderly power, had any relation; and this was the origin of the worship offered by so m any nations to different creatures. From this to figurative idolatry, or the worshi p of i mages, there is but a step; innumerable causes often leading to the substitution of the im age of the id ol, for the idol itself; the people easily transferred their v enerati on from the idol to the im age. Apotheosis has a sim ilar origin; the officiator himself having of ten been taken for the object of the worship. Thus, in nearly all nations, we fi nd a visible Divinity, and an invisib le; in the North, two Odins, one a suprem e God, the other a conqueror; we find two Jupiters am ongst the Greeks; two Zoroasters amongst the Persians; tw o Zam olxis am ongst the Thracians, etc. It is not m ore difficult to discover the source of popular superstitions. It was not the fault of the prophets th at th e J ews fell into all k inds of idolatry, s ince, in th eir writings, p articu larly the Psalm s, the Suprem e God is so clearly distinguis hed from whatever m an has ever taken for God. But on approaching th e sacrifices, whether corrupted or not, and on witnessing the cerem onies of those secondary abom inations alluded to, m en wi ll have seen that, under certain circumstances, preparations of victim s, or arrangements of substa nces, such or such results followed; they will soon have lo st sigh t of th e spirit which ought to di rect all these for malities, and give th em value, and looked to the em pty for m, substance, or isolat ed cerem ony alone, to give them what they had done when. their anim ating spirit was in them .

For this reason the law is always below the term to which it po ints, and to w hich it would lead Man, though it is superior to that in which it found him : for this reason also, these different laws would have been always progressive, if Man had not so often a rre sted the ir cou rse by his errors; but, having continually multiplied h is own falls, and in creas ed his own darkness, he b rought down laws of rigour and constraint, w hen he ought to have received those of gentleness and consolation. The law gi ven to Adam Af ter the f irst expiation of the f irst g uilty m an, he rece ived a law cer tain ly m ore vast and lum inous than that which was afterwards given to the Israelites; we m ay judge of this by the difference of the nam es by which these laws we re governed. It was the P roper Nam e of God which directed the first; it was only the repr esentative nam e which governed the second. See Paul to the Galatians, (iii. 19,) where he says, “this law was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator”. Besides, Adam , though guilty, was only under d o privation o f his prim itive enjoym ents; he was no longer under the polluti on of sin, which had been wa shed out by his baptism of deliverance out of his enem y's hands , or what m ay be called his great, or spiritual circum cision. The corporeal covering he had received, wa s a pure extrac t from all the most vita l substances of Nature, which had not yet undergon e the secondary catastrophes which have since befallen it; it is not surprising then, that, under these circum stances , the law of return given to Ada m, should have been more powerful and virtu al than the J udaical law. W e will co ntent ourselves with a single exam ple to show the difference. It was forbidden to the H ebrews to ally them selves with the nations they were going to make war with, in the pr om ised land ; and the tra nsgress ion o f this law le d to the s everal spe cial bondages they suffered. As for Ada m, and his pos terity, the whole earth was given to him to cultivate it, and to roo t out the thorns and bria rs f rom it; and it is f or hav ing, ou the co ntrary, filled it with wickedness, that the Lord wit hdraws his spirit from m en, and pours out the Deluge upon them . From the extent of the crim e, we may judge of its power; from its power, we m ay judge the extent of the law. This law could not be given to Adam while he was still in the abyss, un der the absolute yoke of his seducer. It w as free grace only which operated in that terrible mom ent, to snatch out of eternal d eath him who was the im age and lik eness of the God of all being; m an was then incapable of profiting by any law; but, this first step surm ounted, he becam e susceptible of a law for his restoration. Now, the law he receive d, bo re, no doubt, the th ree characters we h ave mentioned; or, to speak distinctly, it was a judgment upon the enem y, by whom he ha d been overthrown; it was a warning to m an, to rec ognize the dangers which surrounded him , and preserve him self from more fa lls; lastly, it was a m eans for his sanctification, through the way marked out for his return, and the sacrifices, wh ich, as we see his first-born used them , we m ay    -    142    -"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

The law under Noah That restorative law having been m ade voi d, by the frightful conduct of his posterity, Man, now doubly guilty, was again cast into the abyss, one only shoot being preserved. Noah rem ained f aithf ul to the Lord' s ordinances; a nd when, after the Deluge , we see him offering a sacrifice of sweet savour, we m ust not therefore conclude that he was the founder of sacrifices, but consider him as the pres erver and m inister of a law as old as the very beginning of things ; which, in fact, ind icates that s acrifice was offered by the first m an. If Noah' s offspring had continued in that patriarch' s wisdom and holiness, the work would have advanced towards its term, without it s being necessary to in stitute a new law, and elect a pecu liar peop le; b ecause, all s inners havin g been cut o ff by the Deluge, the family which escaped, and their descendants, would have been the living image of the first m an on his way back, and in the law which favoured their return. But Noah' s offspring, having given them selves to comm it all wickedness, rendered that resto rative law of no effect, and it th en becam e n ecessary for Man, to rep eat what had passed at the beginning, since all tongues were confounded, and there rem ained not, as in the days of Noah, a single fam ily who retained th e pure langu age. Abraham, not under the law In this state of universal da rkness, A braham was chosen to be the chief of an Elect People; everything was given to hi m in principle, revealed, so to speak, prophetically, even to the history of his own people, which he saw in a dream : but nothing was given in developm ent; he possessed not the land that was shown to him ; he was obliged to buy even the cave in the field of Ephron to bury Sarah in. He saw not the num erous progeny which was prom ised to him ; he saw only the prom ised son, not even the sons of this prom ised son, for he died before the birth of Jacob and E sau; he was not charged with any cere monial worship, for the sacrifice which he was commanded to offer, was ordained only to serve as a witness to the covenant; God did not give it to him as an institution. In te lling u s that the m easure of the iniquity of the Am orites was not full, the Scriptures certainly give a sort of reason why the law was not given to Abraham , but a m ore direct reason may be found; which is, that th e law which was to be given, wa s intended for a people, and not for an individual, as in Adam' s case, and this people was not yet born. It had to com e to a people, because it was the peoples or nations that had corrupted them selves and departed from the law; b ecause the cerem onies of t his law requ ired a larg er number of m inisters; b ecause this law was to be grounded on the lost num ber, the ol d num bering of nations, to restore it to them ; and, lastly, b ecause it req uired a receptacle which m ight be co nnected in its subdivisio ns with every ram ification of the law, whereas in Adam , who, corporeally, is the root and trunk of all - 143 -"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

The election of Abraha m could not attain its com plem ent, till the twelv e childr en of Jacob were able, by their num ber, to offer a rece ptacle, capable of receiving the healing influence corresponding to this number. A nd even they received it only in principle, in their father' s blessing s; and, only at S inai, d id the twelve tribes receive th e necessary d evelopm ent of this law, of which their ancestors had rece ived the f irst-fruits. The Mosai law, prep aratory to the spiritual or prophetic law c r This law even was, as yet, only preparatory to the spiritua l law which awaited them , af ter the law of form s and ceremonies should fulfil its c ourse. It was needful that this law of for ms should develop the spirituous grounds and essences wh ich were in them , that they m ight, in their turn, present to the sp irit a recep tacle after its kind , on which it m ight com e and rest. The spiritu al or prophetic law, p eparatory to the divine law Lastly, this s piritual law itself was to be onl y preparatory to the divi ne law , the only true term of Man, seeing that he is a divin e crea ture. Now, it is in th is slow and gentle progression of succours sent from God, that we can say, of all laws in general, wh at St. P aul said of the Hebrew law in particular;... “that the law was our schoolm aster to bring us, children, to Christ”, (Gal. iii. 24-26); for there is not one of those tem poral la ws which m ay not be regarded as a tutor or conductor to what it lead s to, and in respect to which, we really are ch ildren, till we are adm itted into it, and acquire strength to practise it. This has been the divine econom y in all these ep ochs. Under the Leviti cal rule, or that of bloody sacrifices, the priest being yet only in the natural regions, received his subsistence from the people, and the law appointed cities and tithes for his spiritual wants. Under the prophetic rule, God fed His servan ts by special m eans, but through natu ral ag ency, as we see in Elijah and Daniel. Under the law of grace, the founder' s inte ntion was that the p riests should be careful for nothing; nourishm ent was to be given them from heaven, as shown to St. Peter, and in the description and prom ised adva ntages of the living waters. But it is only for tractable and subm issive child ren, that these laws retain this character ; and they show rather what m an ought to be, th an what he actually is. And the hand which adm inisters these salutary laws, is often obliged to let them work for m an's punishm ent rather than for his reward. This, we have seen, was the case, from the la pse of Man, to the law of Moses ; whilst, if Ada m's posterity had been faithful to the assistance they rec eived in the di fferent epochs we have reviewed, they would have grea tly facilitated their return to the Truth, and would have known only the pleasantness of the Divi ne Ways, instead of alm ost al ways experiencing their rigours and bitterness.    -    144    -"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

But, as people, rulers, and pr iests, ceased not to add abom ination to abom ination, and, having violated all the laws of sacrifice, – as , witness the sons of Eli; having abandoned the theocratic governm ent, to substi tute one like that of other na tions from whom their election separa ted th em entirely, it is no t su rprising tha t th is people should be delayed in their course; or, accord ing to the langu age of Scripture, that th e w ord of God should have becom e so s carce am ongst them. But, if m an is arrested in his course by his iniquities, tim e is not st ayed ; and, as the hour of the spiritual law had arrived for the Jews, it could but be carri ed out before their ey es, even though they should be found unprepared. Only, it then took a double character, in confor mity with the double type of m ercy and justice which it has to perfor m on the earth; and, as the light which was kindled at the election of the Jews can not be extinguished, it then displayed, both the first rays of its brightness, a nd the terrors of divine wrath. This is the reason why we clearly distinguis h two kinds of prophecy, one terrifying the people with threats, the other prom ising days of consolation and co mfort to the lovers of peace. We also observe how much the aim of prophecy is enlarged at this epoch; we see how it approaches the regeneration of the hum an soul, which, though aim ed at in all previous divine manifestations, was there concea led under sym bolical ordinances. It is in the Prophets, that we see the chosen m an deploy his character as priest and sacrificer of the Lord; th ere, we see the sacrifice of our sins substituted for that of anim als, and the circum cision of the h eart and spirit recomm ended as the true way of man' s reconciliation to God; there, we see the f alse prophets and bad sh epherds reproached with having first deceived the souls of their flocks, and then assured them that they we re alive ; the re, in short, we see the dawn of that spiritual and divine day which then began to break, never to declin e again; and Man saw, though still only by glim pses, that he was born in the region of spirit and holiness, and his true law, an d true restin g place, cou ld only be found in this region of spirit and ho liness. We say that these truth s were shown to him only in glim pses, because, bes ides m ankind in general, whom the prophets cam e to awake, th ey had to act for, and prophesy to a certain people, in particular, who had not yet got beyond signs and figures. But, in every respect, the prophet m ay always be considered as a victim , whether by reason of the violent deaths which most of them suffered, or still m ore on acc ount of the spiritual la bours they underwent. - 145 -"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

The blood of these prophets becam e the holocaust of propitiation, on which the action of the Spirit operated both more terr ibly and m ore savingly, than it did on the blood of anim als. It operated more terribly, because this blood being unjustly shed, wa s a crying witness of the crim es and blindness of the people. This bl ood, however, attracted the most disorderly of the spiritual influences, with which this lost and guilty people were polluted, accord ing to the laws of transposition which we have stated above. The spirits of the prophets bore also, in their su fferings and travail, the iniquities of Israel, so that, by dispersing these irre gular disorderly influences which clung to the people, the communication of regular and ordinary ones wa s rendered m ore easy and profitable. If the people had profited by all these succours which Suprem e Love and W isdom sent them, they would in their turn have reliev ed the blood and spirit of the pr ophets, of the oppression of those disorderly influences, by communi cating to them again, and partaking with them , the effect of those virtues and orderly influe nces, which the prophets' sacrif ice, bodily and spiritual, had brought down upon them. But, hardening them selves m ore and more, they prolonged to the prophets, even after their death, the pains and labours they caused them during their lives; they m ade heavier by their resistance, the weight of their own iniquities, which, in their divine charity, the prophets had taken upon them selves; thereby bringing upon them selves the double reproach, of not having listened to the voice of W isdom, and keeping in painful durance those w hom W isdom took for its organs; and, for this, all the bl ood of the prophets shed by them , from Abel to Zacharias, will be required of them ; for it m ust not be forgotte n that the Hebrew people were nothing less than the representatives of Man, of the whole posterity of Ada m. On the other hand, the blood of the prophets operated on the people m ore savingly than that of the L evitical v ictim s, because, as m an's bl ood and life are th e seat of the very im age of the Divinity, it could not be shed w ithout releasing, or bringing to li ght, the holy influences which the souls of the righteous naturally diffused around them ; and, if the sacrifices of anim als could open the spiritual region to th e Hebrew people, the blood and voices of the prophets opened to them the avenues of the divine.

The ‘Tableau Naturel’, in showing the necess ity of a Redeemer ( Réparateur ), who should be God-Man, exposed the high m ystery of this sacrifi ce, in which the victim offered itself without comm itting suicid e, and in which the blind sa crif icers, be liev ing that they executed a c rim inal, gave the world, without knowing it, an universal electron, which would work out its renovation; “L' Homm e de Désir” has shown that the blood of this victim was spirit and life, so that when the Jews asked that it should fall upon them and thei r children, they could not separate the m ercy from the justice which w ere both in it together; – We m erely recall, in passing, these com forting and profound truths, which the spirit of m an cannot have. too constantly before him . Man delivered from the prison of his blood We have seen that, after the fall, bloo d becam e the barrier and prison for m an, and that it was necessary that it should be poured out for him to recover his free dom progressively, through the transpositions which this blood-shedding wrought in his favour . But we have seen, at the sam e time, that each of the laws given for his re generation, w as only a so rt of initiatio n into a higher one which should follow; and the aim of a ll these preparatory law s was to lead Man to make a free and voluntary sacrifice o f hi mself; a nd no anterior sacrifice co uld supply the place of this, since, without the shedding of his own blood, he could not be sa id to be really delivered out of the prison in which his blood enclosed him . Now what could teach him this profound and beautiful truth? Not the sacrifice of anim als, for these an im als, being des titute of m orality, gave him no idea of a voluntary sacrifice; and as they brought nothing but th eir bodies to the altar, they could loosen nothing but their corporeal chains. Nor could th e sacrifice and death of the prophets teach it, because they w ent not voluntarily to death, though it m ay be, with resi gnation; and this death was, for those who suffered it, only an uncertain consequence of th eir m ission and not their m ission itself; – because they were sent to announce only th e dawn of the eternal day of m an's deliverance; lastly, because they them selves desired to look into that eterna l day which they proclaim ed without knowing it, and which they got sight of only partially, and at intervals, and by fl ashes of the spirit.    -    147    -"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

Many prophets were em ployed in this pr eparatory work, and the hand which led them in the wilderness traced out different paths for them which they had never travelled before. For this reason, each prophet, walking in hi s own particular path, did not al ways know the final term to which his prophecies pointed; this was unveiled to him only in parts, and as afar off. And the people, who had not recognized the law of the Spirit in the Lev itical ce rem onies, though it was in them , neither did they recognize th e divine law which was contained in the law of the Spirit, or the pro phecies; and, still con tinuing to walk in darkness, they reach ed the epoch of universal deliverance, which had never ceas ed to be spoken of by the prophets, by each accord ing to what it was given him to know; and which was also pointed at in th e book s of Moses, particularly in the bl essings which Jacob pronounced upon hi s children; for, if they had really m ade a careful study of those books, they would have found som ething to arrest their thoughts, w hen they saw the tem poral power of Judah pass into the hands of Herod the Idum ean.

These conditions fulfilled in the shedding of the Redeem er's blood This was the sublim e secret which th e Redeem er cam e to reveal to m ortals ; this was th e shining light he enabled them to discover in th eir own souls, by sacrificing him self voluntarily for them , allowing himself to be seized by those wha m he cam e to overthrow by the breath of his word; and by praying for those who killed his body; and the shedding of his blood accom plished all these m arvels, because, by plunging into our da rk abyss, the Redeem er followed all the laws of transposition by which this regi on is constituted and governed.

The death of Abel was not voluntary: it m ay have been useful for Ada m's advancem ent, in the transp osition of the disorde rly inf luen ces w hich had a ttached to th e guilty f ather of mankind, effected through this blood which was shed; but it did not co mplete the work of alliance with God; for Abel was but a m an concei ved in sin; and his brot her Seth was appointed in his place, to transm it to m an the continuation and course o f the spiritual graces which his death had arrested. The revelation of justice m ade to Noah, and poured out under his eyes, on the posterity of man, placed him , no doubt, in th e firs t rank of tho se chosen by the Lord, for the ex ecution of the plans of his divine W isdom ; but he appears, in th is great catastrophe, rath er as an exterm inating angel, than as a liberator of m ankind; and, besides, the victim s he offered in sacrifice were of a different nature from hi mself, which could procure succours for m an only after their kind. Abraham shed his blood in circum cision, as a sign of his alliance with God, and evidence of his election but he did not pour out the principl e itself of this blood, in which his anim al life resided; we need add no more to what we have already said of this patriarch. His son Isaac cam e very near, but did not c onsumm ate the sacrifice, because m an was still only in the tim e of fi gures, and his father' s faith sufficed to consolidate the alliance, without staining it by the atrocity of infanticide. Moses served as organ for the election of the Hebrew people; he was even its m inister, as man, and as a m an chosen to operate upon Man or his representatives [the Hebrews]; but as he acted only on the representatives of Man in ge neral, he was only called upon to em ploy outward sacrifices, and figurative victim s, for this perm anent reason, that, as Man was yet only at the age of sym bols and figures, the law of transpositi ons could operate upon him only in that way, and could rise no higher.

Everything in the prophets shows what they want ed, for them to be able to introduce Man into the revelation of hi s own greatness; and we m ay add a si mple and striking reason, to what we have said, which is, that those highl y favoured m en were not Man' s Principle. We m ay here find a partial explanation of th e passage in St. John (x. 8): “All that ever cam e before m e are thieves and robbers, but th e sheep did not hear them ”; though this passage applie s m uch m ore direc tly to the hig h pries ts th an to the p rophets. I t sho ws clear ly th at all thos e chiefs and envoys were unable to bring the peopl e into the kingdom , since they walked only in the spirit, and the kingdom is divine ; but it also shows that they were not true shepherds, since they did not give their lives vol untarily for the people; and, instead of protecting them from the enem y, they were often the first to give them up to his rage. This is what God so strongly reproaches them with, in Ezekie l, (xxii. 24-31), where, after marking the crim es of the princes, and the sins of the prophets, he sa ys “I sought for a m an am ongst them, that should be as a hedge, and sta nd in the gap before m e, for the land, that I should not destroy it ; and I found none”. Conditions required for a true deliverer, all fulfilled in Christ. “It is finished” It was, then, reserved far Hi m who was Man' s Principle, to fulfil all these conditions for Man. None but this creative, v ital, and life-giv ing Princip le could be his true deliverer, because the voluntary shedding of his blood, to whic h no blood upon earth could be compared, could alone accomplish the entire disp lacem ent of the foreign substa nces which swa m in Man' s blood. And when this was done, nothing but this divi ne Principle could draw the hum an soul out of its abyss, and identif y itse lf with it, so as to ena ble it to taste of the joys of its tru e nature ; He only, who, being the depositary of the key of David, could, on the one hand, shut the abyss, could, on the other, open the Kingdom of Light, and restore Man to the post which he should always have occupied. And it is to know nothing of this Redeem er, to look at him only in an external and tem poral point of view; without rising, by a progression of th e understanding, to the divine centre to which he belonged. Let us then draw from the diversity of characters with which he was clothed, som e m eans of appropriating to our feeble faculties his spiritual hom ofic ation, which long preceded h is corporeal advent. As the Eternal Principle of Love, it was, firs t of all, necessary, th at he should take the character of imm aterial Man, his Son ; and to accom plish such a task, it was sufficient for him to look at him self in the m irror of the E terna l Virgin, or SOPHIA, in which his Mind ( pensée ) has, - 151 -"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

And, on this, I can but refer the reader to Jacob Boehm e, who has shed so great and profound a light on these sub jects.

According to this explanation of evil , as resting only on displacements ( transpositions ) of substances, it is equally easy to perceive the various properties and uses of the sacrifices, the process and effects of which we have endeavoured to explain. Lastly, it is easy to perceive how va stly supe rio r the sac rifice of the Redeem er was to all that p recede d it; s ince th e very princ e of iniquity which ruled over m an, had to be tran sposed into the abyss; and it was for the suprem e and divine Chief of Light, and Strength, and Authority, him self, to obtain such a victory. It m ay not be superfluous here, to observ e, that, although the bl oody sacrifices of the Jews continued after this great sacrifice, down to the destructi on of their city, they had long reta ined nothing but th e f orm ; the spirit was en tirely loss ; and , since the sa crifice of the divine Victim , it hm teen farth er from them than ever. Therefore they could but degenerate, more and more; and the period which ended in the great outpouring of vengeance upon this guilty peopl e, shows, at once, th e withdrawal of the protective influence ( action ) of the Spirit, and th e terr ible effects of justice of the avenging Spirit; a severe judgm ent, which could not be execu ted at the sam e time as the Redeem er's work, for He cam e to fulfil s work of love and m ercy only. Institution of the Eucharist Although th e sacrifice o f the Redeem er placed m enin a position to fulfil, as far as possible h ere below, their sublim e task of regeneration, by un iting with him and serving him in spirit and in truth ; he lef t, besides, w hen he depar ted f rom the earth, a sign of allianc e, which might bring his presence and devotedness daily befo re us; as we have seen signs and witnesses left after the various m anifestat ions of the laws of justice, the Levitical ordinances, and the prophetic revelations, w hich have been pr om ulgated ever since the world began. He intended this sign of alliance as a developm ent of that divine seed w hich he cam e to sow upon our sterile and corrupt ear th; and, as w e are com posite beings, he com pose d this sign of various operative substances, so that all th e substances of which we are now constituted, might be nourished, p reserved, and supported, each acco rding to its n ecessities and its class.

And the m inisters of holy things have thrown back the hum an m ind on the subject of the Eucharist, by inserting, as they have done, in wh at they call the sacram ental service, the words mysterium fidei, ( holy m yster ies ), which are not in the Gospel, and were far from the Founder' s mind; since, if we e mployed ourselves in our true regeneration , as he never ceased to exhort us to do, there would be no mystery for us; for we are, on the contrary, m ade to bring all mysteries to light, as m inisters of th e Eternal Source of Light. How the Spirit works in the symbol Let us rem ember, that the Spirit rested on th e lam b, at the deliverance out of Egypt; and that is what gave all the value to that sacrifice. T hen, let u s re member that the divine life rested, and still rests, on the sub stances of th e sacrifice o f the new c ovenant; since the Spirit of Truth was not poured out in vain, and cannot be m istaken in its plans and effects; so that ever since the new covenant, (and perhaps from the beginning,) we m ay regard bread and wine as m arked by the spirit of life which has been poured out upon them . We ought never, at any tim e, to eat our bread and drink our w ine, w ithout calling to m ind the sacred sign with which they have been inve sted; ins tead o f allowing th em to f all directly under the elem entary powers which are not holy.

Moreover, this institution of the new cove nant has for signs, four great efficacious unities, namely: The twofold elem entary relation, which is co mm unicated to us in the two substances; The correspondence of all the el ect, who have assisted at the sacrifice, since the beginning of the world ; who are se ated at the holy table, and from thence cause to flow into our hearts, the sacred words they hear; superior, perhaps, to t hose known in the consecration; The pure elem ent, or the true flesh and bl ood, which strengthen a ll our faculties of inte llig ence, and our ac tivity in the w ork; - 154 -"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

Let us rem ember that w e were dead, and that the Redeem er had to enter into our death, to make hi mself like us; but as, in entering into our death, he did not cease to be in life, so, in making hi mself like us, he was st ill our only principle ; thus he could not die without rising again, and raising us with him , that we m ight be like h im; this resu rre ction was necessary, that we m ight tas te, and ex tol, and celeb rate Lif e, whic h was, and will be e tern ally, the end of the existence of every spiritual being, form ed a fter th e im age of t he Sovereign Author of all beings.

We ought, I say, to offer this sacrifice for our own advantage, on the ground of correspondences; for, in m aking a holy use of our constituent principles, we unite ourselves to resto rative influences ( actions ) of the sam e nature as those principles. We ought, m oreover, to do it con tinu ally, to conform to the spirit which h as esta blished itself in us , because th e act of this spirit ought never to be inte rrupted, but increase always. To this high em ploym ent, what we may cal l the f irst age of th e law of Spirit is consecrated; and this duty is so im perative, that, if we fail in it, we soon fall under different kinds of bondage, analogous to our faults; but when, oppre ssed with the yoke of our tyrants, we, on the other hand, cry to the Alm ighty, He sends deli verers to put us in the right way again.    -    159    -"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

Now, unt il the prophetic age, th e Hebrew people lived quite separate from all other na tion s; the ir on ly rela tion with them being to f ight the m; this law f orbad the ir a llying them selves with strangers, and ordered them to practise the worship and cerem onies of which they were depositaries, for their own advantage al one; which is a representation of what we have to do, in our first age of our sp iritual law, when we ought to se parate ourselves from whatever may prevent our growth, or our acquisition of the needful gifts, that the nations m ay one day be blessed in us. But, when the prophetic age arrived, then the germ s of charity were first sown in Israel, as the institution of sacrif ices had planted in them the first ge rm s of the Spirit. This people, who, up to the prophetic age, thought only of them selves, and despised all other people, began, through th e souls of their prophets, to feel zealou s for the retu rn of other n ations to the truth. Then, the prophets becam e oppressed with grie f for all the evils wh ich threatened, not only Israel, but all the sinful na tions round them . Then they were sent to declare the Lord' s wrath in Nin eveh, Egypt, and Babylo n, and the Is lands of the Gentiles. The reason of this m ay be easily perceived; it wa s the m oment when the p rom ises of the alliance with Abraham began to be f ulfilled; bu t, as the Hebr ews were f urther advanc ed in the fulfilm ent of these pro mises than the other na tion s, they were the f irst to f eel th e pains of charity, whilst th e others, so f ar, rece ived only warnings.

The divine S pirit, by descending upon the pr ophets, and laying upon them the burdens of the nations, relieved those nations of part of the weight which crushed them , and who were thereby, also, better enabled to receive the firs t rays of the light which sh ould lead them into the right way; they were, in short, enabled, by the pa ins and anguish of the prophet, to see realized, on them selves, what we have seen w as done se nsibly, by m eans of the m aterial sacrifices.

The divine age for the blessing of all people When the gr eat epoch of salva tion ha d arriv ed, th e true sp irit of sacrif ice acquir ed a still greater extension; it was no longer lim ited, as in the first spiritual age, to th e advantage of a partic ular people; nor to m ere warnings given to other nations, as in the tim e of t he prophets; but it em braced the whol e hum an fam ily, attracting everyth ing towards the f ulfilm ent of the pro mise m ade to Abraham , that in him all people should be blessed.

C onsequently, by going back upon the line of the fault, we cannot fail to arrive at the principle; as, by exam ini ng the nature of the penalty and punishment, we shall not fail to l earn the nature of the offence, of which they are the results. We m ust begin with th e punishm ent, since this has to teach u s what the o ffence was. The next process m ust be to walk back wards along the line of this offence, to arrive at the principle. Thus, our first duty is to cease ou r co mplaints, and go through all the degrees of our punishm ent, with resignation; if we would arrive at a true knowledge of our disorder. Our second duty consists in a li vely, ardent activity, without a look to the right hand or to the left; because this alone can dispel our darkne ss, and bring us back into that life from which the offence or lapse ( altération ) separated us. Our confinement in a dumb wor ld shows th at our offence was against the Word When we exam ine our punishm ent, we rem ark that its m ost prom inent character consists in this, that we are kept shut in, and tied to an universe, which, though upheld by the Word, is without speech; and this is a double punishm ent for us; m aking us feel, on the one hand, the sham eful disproportion there is betw een ourselv es and the dumb creatures around us; and, on the other, how distressing this dum b universe m ust be to the W ord itself; since this W ord would be, and ought to be, m anifes ted everywhere, and freely correspond with all that exists. Now, the first of these punishm ents is dem ons trated not only by the ac tual state of things, but also by m an's conduct towards his fellow-creatures. Although the conversation of m en is very far from the true Word, nevertheless, when men are together, if they did not enliven the atmosphere with their discourse, that feeble shadow of the W ord; if they did n ot the reby a nim ate a lit tle the sepu lchre in which they ar e, th ey would know nothing but the cold wearisom eness of death. The second of these punishm ents also dem onstr ates a living source, incessantly seeking to revive all things by m eans of individual speech ( parole ); for, without such a source, m an would not enjoy this individual speech, of whic h he daily m akes so puerile a use, and from which he has so little profit to expe ct, so long as he is unregenerate. Thus, we may say, we are clearly enlightened as to the punishm ent which has been visited upon us. But, seeing the necessary analogy which subs ists between the punishm ent and the offence, we ought to conclude that, if we are punished by a dearth of the true W ord, it m ust surely be against the Word that we have offended. By the second law, or, as a consequence of the analogy betw een the offence and the princ iple, it results th at, if, in our speech ( parole ), we were to proceed in an invers e direction to that in which we went at the tim e of i ts corruption ( altération ), and in which we walk every day, - 176 -"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

The Word, or true speech, requir es an a pprenticeship, like other talents; Silence But how should m en attain the active enjoym ent of this universal instrument, this W ord, which, though so highly im portant, and greatly to be desired, is, yet, the only talent, or, so to say, the only trade they exercise, wit hout the preparation of a long a pprenticeship, such as they pass through in cultiv ating o ther talents ? For, I re peat, what m en say everywhere, and all d ay long, must not be m istaken for the W ord ( parole , true speech) ; they m ay be vain and igno rant enough to think it such; wh ereas it is absolute ly its inversion. In fact, the Word is learnt only in th e silence of every th ing in this world ; there on ly is it to be heard; and, when we speak, whether to others or to ourselve s, of anything belonging to this world, it is clear that we act co ntrary to the true Word, and not for it ; for we thereby only degrade ourselves, and naturalize ourselves with the world; which, as we have just said, being without speech, is theref ore at once the m ode and the instrum ent of our punishm ent. Let us not, however, forget another fact , equally true, and incomparably more comforting: that is, the f eeling th at if sin deprived us of every thing, and left us in a state of absolute des titu tion, it is necessary for our cure that everythin g should be again giv en to us by Infinie Universal Love; otherwise our cure would never be absolute. Now this universal gift, which Love again bestowed upon the world, is com prised altogether in the wonders of the W ord, it being the loss of these riches which kept us in want. But we can now learn this speech (W ord) of the Spirit, but very slowly, as we see childr en learn hum an speech. W e ought also to learn it in a natural way, insensibly, as child ren learn it. Hence the G ospel precep t: “Excep t y e becom e as little children, ye shall not en ter in to the k ingd om of heaven”.

By W ord, God rules the course of His genera l te mpora l spiritual a lliance : when this alliance has acquired a sufficient amount of stre ngth, by the attraction of its powerful divine elem ents, the W ord allows it to ex plode, and itself passes in the torr ent of that explosion, in order that its salutary substances m ay the better penetr ate in to the re gions whic h await them ; and here is one of the wonders of active num bers, whic h, though nothing in them selves, as I have said before, faithfully represent the hidden course of the W ord, and its in estimable prop erties. It is by W ord, also, that God m akes a partic ular and continu al allian ce in the earthly nature and v egetation, in which order every produ ction is always preced ed by the grad ations of activ ity, germ ination, and growth, attracting each other recip rocally, and term inating in an explosion, either by florescence, or by a birth, when the eye, or centre of life in each, has dissipated the obstacles which surrounded it, and is able to take possession of its rights. Want of a spiritual language As these grounds of action are dissem inated through Nature, so are the germ s of science dissem inated through all m en: we only want an analogous langua ge or speech (parole) to communicate them to each other. If we cultiv ate d these ge rms carefully, they would them selves produce for us a language which would convey thei r fruits to us; but we are carried away by im patience ; and, instead of waiting for the fructif ication of this language, we are in haste to com pose different langu ages for ourselves, accordi ng to the different sciences we m ay practise. At the sam e tim e, as these languages are ba rren, unlike the one whos e place they usurp, they bring us no profit ; they touch not the germ s out of which fruit should spring. And m en's scientific res ults s top, for the m ost part, at our co mposite factitious langu ages; and hum an sciences generally lodge in the outward form , not in the vi rtue of the words; and their scien tific languages hav ing no life in them selves, cannot v ivify each oth er; and as th ey cannot vivify, they begin only b y disputin g and opposin g, and end by destroy ing each other. Thus they propagate death, which, since the Fall, has spread its em pire everywhere; whereas, they ought to have seconded life, or th e W ord, which, since that great change, cannot make a step without having to fight for it. In fact, every generation, every vegetation, every restorative act or operation, even every thought w hich tends towards the region of light, for ms so many resurrections and real conquest s over death.

Thus, then, the heart of Man is chosen to be the depositary of God' s anguish, the friend of His choice, the confidant of all His secrets a nd wonders, seeing that none of them can have effusion or issue except through anguish.

Re main, then, constantly on this central radical fire, as an inf ant rem ains in its m other' s wom b, till it is strong en ough to bear the light of day; or, if a less dignified com parison m ay be used, as a mess being cooked, rem ains on the fire till it is done. Under all this there are g reat experimental p rincip les and truths. The m ost im portant is, that we should know and feel which is the greatest anguish that God experiences. It is that which com es from His continua l atte mpts to exh ume Him self out of the heart of Man, and the frightful obstacles which the heart of Man opposes to Him. For this reason, all the abyssal fire w hich is kindled beneath us th rough life, is pot too much to dissolve the thick coagulations which choke us. For, if this a byssal f ire d o not prepa re the way, th e W ords of divine angu ish will nev er enter us; and if the W ord of anguish do not ente r, we can never understand the universal anguish of all things, and can never be their com forters. Yes, if we have not the substance of life in activity within us, how should we be able to judge, or even be sensible of what is dead around us? Thus, it is not m erely Nature' s sabbath, nor even that of the hum an soul, which so urgently requires our care; we have also to m ake the W ord itself enjoy its sabbath, since it cannot be denied that, owing to the nugato ry, false, or perverse use Man makes of the Divine W ord, it is on its bed of suffering, not to say its death-b ed; and m an can bring it no relief till h e feel every anguish of the W ord born within him . The true Cross We see m en give the nam e of crosses of expia tion, to disappointm ents of tem poral life, to worldly afflictions, to bo dily infirm ities, etc.; wh ilst th at nam e, in its tru e signification, applies only to th e spiritual p ains of m en de voted to the Lord' s work, and called to labour in it, acco rding to the ir ab ility or gif ts. This class of m en are generally tied to ci rcum stances which are quite opposed to the divine work they long for, for which they were made, and of which they are so little able to speak, that they would often rather allow them selves to be covered with derision and contem pt, than open th eir m ouths about it. It is to m en of this class th at the Gospel p recep t applies: “W ho- soever taketh not up his cross, a nd followeth not after m e, is not wo rthy of m e”. For, if they do not determ ine to bear the cross which is presen ted to them , and go forwards, notwithstanding the anguish it prom ises them , they run the risk of m issing their w ork, and being treated as bad servants. - 180 -"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

I am not afraid to say, that even very great saints have failed to give to this grand passage all the m eaning that be lon gs to it; and the f amous saying of St. Theresa, “L et m e suffer, or die”, give s only half of it. The cr oss is far anterior to evil ; and when it m akes itse lf felt in us now, acti ng in the confinem ent of our present spiritual tramm els, it is to lead us to its own free action, an d teach us, in its own bo undless m unificence, notwithstanding our pollutions, what the cross before evil is. No, no! The cross is not a suffering; it is the Eternal Root of Eternal Light. It is not the less true that, if the elect have to bear courage ously the painful efforts which this cross m akes in them , to arrive at the region of liberty; with far more reason ought we all to bear the tribulations of this world, both bodily and spiritual, to which we give the nam e of crosses; and this resigna- tion will be the m ore m eritorious, that, in the st ate of disorder and disc ordance into which the Fall has thrown us, we are not all called to feel, at l east in the sam e degree, the anguish of the higher cross. I will no t sa y that m en derive no p rofit f rom their inf erio r wa y of viewing the Gospel precep t in reference to th e cross; I wo uld m erely have m en of desire know that they m ay derive far greater advantage from it in another way; for it is in their disappoint ments and contrarieties, in things divine, with which their faith is at once tried and nourished, that th ey first begin to learn what the sufferings of the W ord are, and they tak e comfort and are even g lad, ins tead of com plaining because the W ord does not advance in its p ains, without also advancing towards the great epoch of its deliverance. In advancing thus, its anguish and tribulation increase m ore and m ore; the Psalm s would be very different from what they are, if they we re to be written now. For the W ord is the divine desire, personified and in action in man. In propor tion as it penetrates and discovers itself in the hum an atm osphere, so it is reduced to feed upon gall and bitterness.

Such is generally our situation here below : we are all und er m edical treatm ent, for the consequences of the great disorder, or those of our own errors; when we observe and f ollow all that is laid down for our spiritual health, we are therein useful only to ours elves. It is wrong to call that serving God, for it is not serving Him . When we are regene rate, and able to f ulfil the dif ferent m inistries of our Master, then we are supposed to really serve God; for then we may, through the m edium of our own pains, feel and know experim entally the pains of the W ord: till then, we feel only our own.

Brave men afraid in the dark The power to cast ou t th e enem y, although, by virtue of our s peech, one o f our prim itive rights, rem ains not only in suspen se, but, from ha ving fallen so long into disuse, has com e to be considered as an im aginary thing ; and here, independently of idleness, which draws worldly people together, we get an insight into the reason of their love for late hours, and their turning night into day; they are far from supposing that this inc lina tio n, to which they yield, h as a very deep root. If m an were in his true la w m ilitant, h e would watch m uch more at n ight, to drive the enem y away, than by day: this was the original object of the nocturnal prayers of religious affiliation s, and this is s till p ractised m aterially in our m ilitary encam pm ents. For, in both orders, it is in the night-tim e that the enem ies commit their greatest ravages, as, in fact, it was d uring th e sleep of the firs t m an that he becam e his adversary' s prey, and th e divine covenant was forgot. Without rising to this spiritua l law militant, if m an were, in his natural law, pure, he would sleep peacefully through the n ight, and derive from hi m rest a ren ewal of strength for his labours. Such is the case with the m an of toil and the peasant, who, generally, are little troubled by the enem y during their sleep. But the m an of the world who feeds only on vacuity and corruption, and does not work, has no such quiet nights; and, as he pursues those false substances with w hich he allows him self to be continually im pregnated, and over whic h the enem y's rights extend – which rights he enforces during the hours of night, more than in the day – this is why worldly people who are without th e Word (true speech), and who run aw ay from them selves, yet seek each o ther so eagerly during the nigh t hours, becau se thereby, w ithout kno wing it, th ey dim inish the force of their enem y's attacks. It is, m oreover, well known, that som e very brave m en, who continually face danger and death unm oved, will no t enter a church, or a grav e-yard, alon e at nigh t. No doubt, these brav e men have not all their rational principles devel oped; but the developm ent of their reason would not alone enable them to trium ph in such cases, if there is a real ground for the feeling of tim idity which darkness inspires; and, what the savans ca ll developm ent of reas on, in this respect, consists, not in their overcom ing the obstacle, but in persuading themselves tha t it do es not exis t.

There we shall learn that Nature was given to m an to serve as a type and f igure of the suprem e truth which he can see no more; that when he is deprived of this type by darkness, and has not reco vered his sp eech ( parole ), lie is doubly separated from the truth; that having neither the copy nor the original near him , he is in co mplete privation, and pursued by vacuity with all its horrors. But this solution, t hough correct, is yet not the deepes t. The f ollowing is deeper, and not less true. Nature, a prison for the enemy, a preser vat ive for man Nature was intended to s erve as a prison f or the enem y, still more than f or m an; f or to m an it was given for a preservative also. W hen this preser vative is not before hi s eyes, the thought of the enem y is secretly awakened in him ; perhaps th e enem y m ay more easily approach him when this obstacle is less active, and m en cannot draw from their preservative a ll the support they would, were it visible to them . Thus, in this case, the presence of the sm alle st person is reassuring, because their com bined forces can dispel th e enem y. It is, th en, this secret dread of the enem y which pursues m en in the dark; and this dread ca n only be completely dissipated by the sense of a spiritual power, which they can find only in be ing truly born again, or in alliance with the Word. When we recognize that the darkness of Natu re acts so powerfully upon us, and the sight of it gives such a feeling of s ecurity, how can we avoid the conc lusion that it was given to m an, as m uch for his preservation and safety, as fo r the purpose of separating him from the Great Light? The root-worm of Nature It has also b een rem arked that fear h as, in som e people, produced worm s. This opinion, which was advanced by Dr. Andry in his Trea tise on the Generation of Worm s in the hum an Body, quite agrees with true principles. They who have had opportunity to consider and understand the funda mental form s of Nature, are aware that the worm represents its root; showing the degradation this Natu re has experienced, and the effo rts it va inly m akes to delive r itself from anguish, by circulating continually. The healing power, which applied a refrigerant to this disorde rly roo t, thu s caused th is root to b e co ncealed fro m us during our anim al ex isten ce. It is, as it were, absorbed b y the harm onious, beneficent influence of this refriger ant. But when, from any cause whatever, this com es to be disturbed, and lose its dom inion, th en the root-worm naturally takes the rule, and shows itself. Now, of all our passions and weakne sses, fear, which is the one which most readily deprives us of speech, is also the one most apt to disturb the refrig erant, and consequently to give our root-worm and its productions a pre-em inence they would not otherwise have had, i.e., if we had been in possession o f our speech .    -    191    -"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

As for these noisy adm irers of style, then, it is generally true that their outward senses only are struck, and are capable of being struck, owing to the dire ction they have given to their facultie s. Their inner m an is f or ver y little in their pleasur es, of ten f or nothing at a ll. Their im agination is every thin g ; and th is, less in its ra tional and ju dicia l cha racter than in its sensib le quality, which, in them , com es nearer to what is sensitive and conventional than to the living truth. Fine verses, beautiful periods, are enough to transport th em ; it m atters not whether they result in falsehood or truth. I, who render sincere hom age to true liter ature, and who would see it applied to its legitim ate object; I, who believ e its p owers to be as vast as the infinite itself, and that it was intended for the enjoym ent of boundless privileges, it pains me when I see its partisans lower it to such inferior trium phs and restrict it to the balancing of words, when it ought to be employed in collecting the grand thoughts dissem inated and lo st in our desert, since our woeful dispersion. And when I see literary m en, especially poets, c onfine themselves within conventional rules of versification, and the art of writing, and then glorify them selves for the happy, though transient sparks which, occasion ally, th ey present to our eyes, it seem s to m e like a st rong m an tying all his m embers with chains, and thinking these tramm els do him honour, when, notw ithstanding their weight, he succeeds, now and then, in moving a finger.

In this point of view, to be truly in Christianity, w ould be to b e united with the Spir it of the Lord, and to have perfected or consummated our alliance with Him .

And the third and fourth, in St. Jam es (i. 26, 27) where he m erely says: “If any m an bridle not his tongue, but deceive his ow n heart, this m an's religion is vain”; and, “Pure religion, and undefiled before God, the Father, is to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep him self unspotted from the wor ld”; exam ples in which Christianity seem s to tend m ore towards its d ivine sub lim ity, or p lace of rest, th an to clo thing itself in the d ress we are accus- tom ed to call religion. Here, then, is a table of differences between Christian ity and Catholic ism Christianity is nothing but the spir it of Jesus Christ in its fulness, after this Divine Physician had ascended all the steps of his m ission, which be comme nced at m an's fall, when he promised that the wom an's seed should crush the serpent' s head . Christianity is the complem ent of the priesthood of Melchisedek; it is the soul of the Gospel; and it causes the living waters which nations thirst' for, to ci rculate in that Gospel. Catholicism [the Church], to which the title of religion prope rly belongs, is a way of trial and trav eil to arriv e at C hristian ity. Christianity is the region of e mancipation a nd liberty: Catholicism is only the sem inary of Christianity; the region of rule s and discipline for the neophyte. Christianity fills all th e earth alike with the Spirit of God. Cat holicism fills only a portion of the globe, notwithstandi ng its title of universal. Christianity carries our faith up to the lum inous region of the Eternal Divine W ord; Catholicism lim its this faith to the written word, or tradition. Christianity shows us God openly, in the hear t of our being, w ithout the help of for ma and for mulas. Catholicism leaves us at war with ourselves, to find God hid under ceremonies. Christianity has no m ysteries ; th e very nam e is repugnant to it; for, essen tially, Christianity is evidence itself, and un iversal clear ness, Catholicism is f ull of m ysteries , and its foundation is veiled. The sphinx m ay be placed at the ou tran ce of tem ples built by m en's hands; it canno t be seated in the heart, whic h is the rea l entran ce to Christianity. Christianity is the f ruit o f the true : Catholicism can only be the dressing. Christianity m akes neither m onasteries nor ancho rites, becau se it can no more isolate itself than can the light of the sun; and because, like the sun, it seeks to s hine everywhere. Catho licism peopled th e deserts with solitar ies, an d the towns with re ligio us communities ; the f ormer, to devote themselves m ore easily to their own salvation, the latter to present to the corrupt world som e image s of virtue and pi ety, to rouse it in its lethargy. - 200 -"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns. Edward B. Pen ny Christianity has no sect, since it em braces un ity, and unity being alone, cannot be div ided in its elf . Catholicism has seen a m ultitud e of schism s and sects spr ing f rom its bosom, which have prom oted the reign of divisi on, rather than that of concord; and Catholicism , even when it supposes itself in the highest degree of purity, can find hardly two of its m embers who believe alike.

It was a f alse im itation of Christianity, to say th e le ast, which in vented th e Crusades ; Catholicism adopted them afterwards: but, fanaticism commanded them ; Jacobinism co mposed them ; anarchy directed them ; and brigand ism executed them. Christianity has declared war only ag ainst sin; Catholicism , against m en. Christianity m arches only by sure and con tinuous experience; Cat holicism m arches only by author ity and institu tions; Chris tianity is the la w of faith; C athol icism is the f aith of the law. Christianity is the com plete in sta llation of m an's soul into the rank of m inister or workm an of the Lord; Ca tholicism lim its m an to the care of his own spiritual health. Christianity continually unites m an with God, as being by their nature two inseparable beings; Catholicism , while it uses the sam e language, yet so feeds m an with m ere for ms, that it m akes hier lose sight of its real object , and contract m any habits which do not always turn to his profit or real advancem ent. Christianity rests imm ediately on the unwritt en W ord; Catholic ism rests on the written Word, or Gospel, in general; and on the m ass, in particular. Christianity is an active and perp etual, spiritual and divine sacr ifice, either of the soul of Jesus Christ, or of our own; Ca tholicism , which rests particularly on the m ass, presents only an ostensible sacrifice of the body and blood of the Redeem er. Christianity can be com posed of the holy ra ce of prim itive man alone, the true sa cerdo tal race. Catho licism , resting particularly on the m ass, was, as Christ' s last Pas sover, at the m erely initiatory degrees of this priesthood; for, when he said to his disciples, Do this in reme mbrance of me , they had already received powe r to cas t o ut devils, to cure sicknesses, and raise the dead; but they had not yet received what was m ost i mpo rtan t for th e f ulness of the priesthood; since the consecration of a priest consists in th e transm ission of tim e Holy Spirit, a nd the Holy Spirit was not yet g iven, because the Redeem er was not yet glorified (John vii. 39). Christianity becom es a continual increase of light, from the mom ent the soul of m an is adm itted into it Catho licism , which has m ade the holy supper its h ighes t and m ost sublim e degree of worship, has allowed a veil to be throw n over this cerem ony, even inserting, as I have observed before, in the canon of the m ass, the words mysterium fidei , which are not in the Gospel, and are con trary to the universal light of Christianity.    -    201    -"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

Finally, it is possible that there m ay be m any Catholics, who, yet, are unable to judge what Christianity is; but it is im possible for a true Christian not to be able to judge what Catholicism is, and what it ought to be. Christianity and Art When credit is given to Christianity for th e progress of arts, and particularly for the perfecting o f literature and poetry, it is an honour which it is very far from claim ing.

Because it dwe lls am ongst divine wonders, and, to sing of these, it ha s m o need to seek how to express itself; they supply everything, the affections , the idea, and the expressio n.

The origin and spirit of art and literature are pagan, not Christi an, nor Catholic But, m ore: Catholic ism , to which th e nam e of Chris tian ity h as been too r eadily g iven , even Catholicism is not what has pro duced the de velopm ent of liter atur e and art. Neither by it, nor in its fold, have m odern poets and artists b een for med: they studied th e chef d'oeuvres of antiquity, w hich was pagan, and trie d to copy them ; but, as they lived in the m idst of institutions of Catholicism , it was natura l tha t th eir works sh ould bear very generally on religious subjects.

In fact, if there had been no Ph idias and Praxiteles, is it at all certain that we should have had a Raphael and a Michelangelo, and their chefs d'oeuvres, the subjects of which they chose in the religious order? If there had been no De mosthenes and Cicero, who knows if we should have bad a Bossuet and a M assillon ? If th ere bad been no Hom er and Virgil, a Dante, a Tas so, a Milton, or a Klopstock would probably never have thought of clothing the religious events they celeb rated w ith th e colou rs of poetic f iction becau se the purer genius of Catholicism its elf would have opposed these fictions and works of i magination. But, if the empire of Constantinople had not been overthrow n, would Catholicism at all have boasted of so m any m arvels and geniuses of all kinds, of which it becam e the centre and focus after that event? And, if Italy had not r eceived the brilliant inheritance, would France, which, in respect of writers and orators, has be en the brightest crown of Catholicism , have attained so high a degree of glory of this kind? We m ay confidently reply in the negative, a nd affirm that, without the age of Julius II. and Leo X., Catholicism would not have developed the talents, and gathered the laurels, which distinguished it under Louis XIV. But, as all these adventitious supports, these arts, and models of antiquity, in eloquence and literature, contribute d only a borrowed light or life to Catholicism , inclining it r ather toward s hum an glory than to that solid and substantia l glory of which they knew nothing, they could not bri ng it any lasting; advantage. So their relations being frail and precarious, literature and ar t were not long before they left Catholicism behind, and carried off the crow n for them selves. Though m ore progress they made, the inure Catholicism receded; and we have seen how much their empire inc reased in th e eighteenth century, and how m uch Catholicism declin ed; and, even now, notwithstanding the efforts of governm ent to re-establish the Church, they are still far from yielding the field: – Now this is a triumph they would not have gain ed so easily over Christianity, or the W ord. If we go farther back, we sha ll s ee th at ar ts and litera ture we re always sub sidia ry to Catholicism , and never its wards or pupils.

It m ay be said that such was its existence for nearly ten centuries. Literary art totally disconne cted from Christianity as well. Religious literati If, from all these facts, it a ppears that Catholicism never ha d any relation to the arts and literature but that of dependence, what shall we say of Christia nity, which not only never had any direct relation with them , but never w as in any way dependent upon them ? To realize the imm ense distance there is between arts and literature on the one hand, and Christianity on the other, we need only repeat that, in these works of m an, it is m an's spirit, a nd som etimes less than this, which does all; and that, in Chris tian ity, the Eterna l W ord rules a lone .

He cannot restrain him self from exclaiming, “ We find som ething so grand and extrao rdinary in this scene of Genesis, that it eludes all critical explanations; adm iration wants words, and art returns to dust”. I will add, on this subject of art, would to God it had never com e out of the dust; for it ought to have no other place of abo de, and it ou ght always to leave the field free for the W ord.

Pen ny Milton and the Bible. Gradatio ns in Adam's fall The eloquent writer in question is transported at Ada m's awa king from hi s sleep, and says that Milton would never have reached these heig hts if he had not known true religion: and I answer that, if Milton had known true Christian ity, the W ord, he would have painted Ada m in other colours. Art has no secrets but to m ake com parisons be tween subjects with which it is acquainted. Art teaches that a child is a creature which “awak es to life, opens its eyes, and knows not whence it com es”. Af ter this pa ttern Milton drew Adam's picture: he m akes him only a great child, with this difference, that he gives him a sublim e sense of his own nature, and em inent powers for giving nam es to things, which the child does no t possess; yet, the father having had them , it would be hard to say why the child should not ha ve them also, since the fruit should be as the tree. Now, f rom the child and the savag e m aterialis ts and ideologists have drawn their system s of sensation, origin of language, etc., and, st opping there, they have ended by anim alizing our whole being . But the Bib le (f or we sp eak of this h ere), which it is pr etend ed was Milto n's guide, shows Adam in another aspect. In the firs t p lace, we m ay believ e that, in com ing out of his M aker' s hands, Adam was not subject to sleep, since it was only after he had gi ven things their nam es that the Creator sent a sleep upon him , during which the wom an was take n out of his bones, or his strong essences. Secondly, it is probable that this sleep, and extraction of the wom an from his side, was the consequence of some change already comm enced in Adam ; since the Creator had said (in the first chapter), when the creation was ended, th at\" all that He had m ade was very good”; and then He says (in the seco nd chapter), that “it was not good for m an to be alone”. Thirdly, whether this giving of names was pe rform ed by Adam on his leaving his Maker' s hands, or on ly after that change had commenced, it is certain, accord ing to thé tex t, th at it was anterior to his sleep. This being the case, Adam m ust have then enjoyed great light and vast knowledge, since the Creator had established him ove r all the works of His hand, and installed him in the garden of deligh ts, and charged h im to cultiv ate it, comm itting all the p lants with wh ich it was f illed to h is care, even the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of which He forbad him to eat. Thus Ada m had no need to awake unto life, but, on the contrary, it was he who awoke life in the creatures ; which is very different from what happens with children ; but art concealed these things from Milton , and left him to his im agination. It was, also, accord ing to art, that he de scrib es th e loves of Adam and Eve, supposing them to be in their first heavenly state, which they were not. For he re cognizes their sexes, and celeb rates th e consumm ation of th eir m arriage, which could take place on ly acco rding to the law of anim als, and which produced such bad fruit in the person of Cain.    -    205    -"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

And how could they have known anim al love, if they had not known their be stial organs, since we see, in m an, that his epoch of love is when hi s bestiality speaks? But how could they have known this bestiality if they had not been guilty, since, according to the text, it was only then they knew they were naked? And, if they were guilty, what becom es of t heir heavenly loves, their purity, and their innocence, of which the poet draws such brilliant pictures? Doubtless, they had not then that im modest m odesty, which is only a secondary sentim ent derived from education; but they ha d a deep sense of sha me, arising from the com parison of their pr esent bes tial state with that they had ju st lost; f or th en their eyes were opened to their vile, degraded state, and closed to the divine wonders. Milton knew nothing of the grad ations of the sin of our fi rst parents. One of these gradations m ay, indeed, have perm itted the enjo ym ent of som e delicious m oments in the gard en of Eden, after the change had commenced; but they were then m ore caref ul about their Sovereign' s commands, and the prohibition He had laid upon them , than about their own charm s and loves; and, when this degree had passed, th ey would be too m uch occupied with their laborious and painful situation to converse very quietly and te nderly together; a thing suitable only to the blind and idle lovers of our world, who have nothing else to do. Milton, then , copied tho se loves from the l oves of earth, altho ugh he em bellish ed them magnificently. Yes, his long description of the lo ves of Ada m and Eve proves that the poet had but half clipped his pencil in the truth. The Scriptures are m ore concise in details of this nature. In the case before us they m erely say that Ad am knew Eve, that she conceived and brought forth Cain, saying, “I have gotten a m an fr om the Lord”. I repeat, then, that as Christianity, or the Word, would not be honoured by having contributed to the birth of all th ese fictions of Milton, so it is far from claim ing them . It is no t th at, as an am ateur of belles -lettr es , I do not adm ire Milton' s poetic talent, and the m agnificent scenes his pencil produced; I am even well pleased, in the cause of religion, that he traces to us som e sha des of celestial happiness, and pure love , which serves for its basis; and, for the sake of these sweet pictures, I forgive his anachronisms: but, as a lover of truth, I regret that he, as well as all his com peers, does not de scribe things more exac tly, poets being supposed to speak the language of the gods. The poet' s license allows him to fill up, at his p leasure, the canvas of th e histo ry of m en; but this is not pe rmitted in the history of Man, of whom the Truth alone has a right to speak. These f ew exam ples will suf fice to s how the imm ense distance the re is between Christianity and the a rt o f the religio us litera ti, a nd to f ix the lim its of the inf luence of Christianity on poetry.

I have no other fear!” Literary ar t unprofitable even on the stage But, if we would judge h ow little pro fit these ri ches, in th e hands of the literary, b ring to Christianity, we have only to see the sm all e ffect which the finest thoughts and m axims, and most appropriate to every true want of our being, produce upon the stage. The spectator who hears them , but who, like the poet, has only the outward m an ope n in him , experiences a slight im pression, a sort of sentim ental emotion, whic h affects him for the m oment ; but, having no deep roots, and being very like a m uscular s ensat ion, it term inates at the extrem ities of his nerves by a clapp ing of his hands, and evap orates in th e air. So, when the piece is over, the s pectators disperse, to plunge again in their custom ary vaniti es, without so m uch as rem embering what they felt, still less prof iting by it.

So Truth shudders continually at the little prof it she receives from th e m arvellous talents which great writers and poets disp lay, who, if they som etimes appro ach her confines, it is only to absorb and bury her in the region of vain appear ances, which is not her ow n; and what I here say of the literati generally, applies unf ortunately, but too well, to religi ous wr iters also; th eref ore, in their hands, their science has com e to be m erely an art. W ith this art, its form s and precepts, and its stores of rules and formulas, we might undoubted ly produce, in a m anner, som e works, if not of solidity and grace, at leas t correct, as a pie ce o f m usic m ay be played w ith dice; bu t true genius, especially re ligious genius, does not shut itself in formulas. In a word, they have studied how to give us em otions, and tickle us, as rest aurateurs study the art of producing sensations on our palates: both of them would be afraid of using anything that would produce sensations too strong, and that would be likely to ef fect a purif ication and renovation of our digestive organs ; they leave th ese cares to those w ho take charge of our health; yet, from the way we are living in this lower world, it m ay be granted that dispensers of health are m uch mo re needed than restau- rateu rs. The reason why lite ratu re and poe try, even of a re ligious ch arac ter, y ield so little pr ofit to the cause of Truth, is, that thos e who cultivate an d profess them, do not so m uch as imagine that this Truth might really be their guide, and that them selves ought to be nothing less than her organs and m inisters ; and, concei ving nothing grander than a fine poe m, they really believe that man has nothing m ore glorious to do on this e arth than to c arry of f the palm f rom all com petitor s in tha t rac e. The laws o f Truth are independent of ar t and forms, of poets and critics ali ke In this persuasion they exert them selves, a nd redouble their efforts to fix rules and laws, whilst a ll th ey required w ould be simply to follow those dict ated by T ruth, from all eternity. They labour hard to bring thei r own industry and their own m ind into action; whereas the first thing they should do, ought to be to forget this dark m ind of m an, and ve ry hum bly to im plore the favour of Truth, that she would condes cend to adm it them into her service. It is very doubtful, I adm it, whether she w ould then require them to m ake poem s; and, if it should so happen, it w ould be onl y after having effectually laboured in her work; for she would order th em to celeb rate f acts which concerned her onl y; deeds of which she had m ade them agents, and which would therefore be their own doi ng; seeing that no bard can sing of deeds so well as the doer him self.

We m ay judge how often Milton m ay have been under the influence of this astral heav en, since he could work at his poem s onl y at cert ain seasons of the year .

The marvellous is ever y thing in an epic . T he highest order of the marvellous I regret to see our eloquent writer repr oach Milton and Dante for having m ade the marvellous the subject, and not the m achiner y, of their poem s; as if there were nothing marvellous but m agical m achines; or, to speak more correctly, as if every thing were not magical, and therefore m arvellous, from the radical eterna l Source of all th ings, to th eir com plete developm ent in every region, and th eir final return to th eir principle; and as if the m arvellous were not th erefore really the princip le, the sub ject, and the m achinery of every truly epic work. For, if the p oet chose fo r his sub ject som e m erely historical fact of earthly order, and wished to connect with it som e ki nd of the m arve llous other than that of fables and fairy tales, he would have no choice but to begin by raising his heroes to the rank of demigods, as all epic poem makers do; then, entering into the spirit of true C hristianity, which m akes of m an nothing less than a son of God, and a n im age of God, he m ight, without anti phrasis, and he ought even of necessity, to develop all the m arvello us m achinery which constitutes the m arvellous existence of all being, from God to the anim alcule, and which, by its lively and constant action, entertains the ineffable harmony of all things. Now in this way, what could they offer us m ore m arvellous than the active treasures of the W ord? Descriptive poetry As to this eloquent writer' s persuasion that Christianity has given birth to, and been favourable to descriptive poetr y, by extending the harm onies of religion to natural objects, I think that in this, he has judged things rather as they m ight be, than as they are.

The principal difficulty, in m y opinion, is, not to prove to unbelievers the existence of God, nor even that of the soul ; especially if proofs are taken in the Spirit-Man. Many philosophers, taking this light foi their guide, have proved these two facts, by reasons such as the sect of atheists require; that is, such as positive m inds m ay com pare with what they c all dem onstrations of A + B. And there is nothing to wonder at in this, since, in spite of all the reveries of atheists and materialis ts, the only inability which we can reco gnize in Go d, is, that He is unable to conceal Hi mself; and the soul of m an, which is His im age, shows itself continually in all our acts, even in the very effort we m ake to deny it.

In fact, reason and logic prove m erely the ex istence of God and the soul. The object of religion should be to prove their m utual relations , and bring them together ; this union cannot take place witho ut an in ward concurrence on our part, and the voluntary actio n of our being.

How then would th ey prove them if there were no books, and no universe ?

Thus, if there is an A + n to prove the ex istence of God, and the imm ateriality of the Spirit-Man, there m ust be an A + n to prove our degradation, and conseque ntly religion, which is its rem edy; as there m ust also be an A + B to pr ove the efficacy of this rem edy, which cannot fail to be spec ific; f or if the will of free beings m ay neutra lize it in rega rd to them selves, and preven t its operating for them , they cannot prevent its operating against them . Now, all these kinds of proofs, though different from each other, m ust each be positiv e in its kind. Rational, affectional, and experi mental proofs positive The first of these proofs, or that which has for object the existence of God, and the Spirit- Man, m ay be called a rational and intellectual pr oof-positiv e; because it b elongs, in fact, to sim ple reflection and reasoning. The second, which refers to our degradation, and, therefore, to re ligion, we will call a sentim ental or affectional proof-positive, becau se it necessarily requires th at m an should put in action a new faculty, besides that of judgm ent; as the m edical facu lty m akes a m an sensible that he is attack ed with a serious illn ess, there by cau sing him unea siness and alarm about the danger he is in, and points out, at the sam e tim e, the re medy that m ay be useful to him ; whilst, to know and possess m edicinal science, the student has only to m ake use of his reason. Lastly, the third proof, the object of which is to dem onstrate the powers of the m inisters of religion, and the superiority a nd efficacy of religion its elf, we will call an experim ental p roof- positiv e; be cause it is a q uestion of facts; and bec ause, tak ing possession o f all our f aculties, it confirm s the two preced ing proofs, the sentim ental proof-positive and th e intellectu al p roof- positiv e. If we transpos e these d ifferent k inds of proof s, or e mploy only one, where a ll a re required, how can we expect the adv ersar ies to s ubm it? It is not very difficult, as I have asserted, to dem onstrat e th e n ecessary and exclus ive suprem acy of One Superior Being, as well as our radical connection with Him ; without which we could not so m uch as question His ex istence, nor even think of Hi m. In fact, we can really call great a being only who is so much so that none other can surpass, or even equal him. Now, in this se nse, there is non e great but God; because, Hi mself being all, it is im possible for any other being, no t only ever to exceed Him in greatness, but ever even to attain to an equality. For this reason, after God, all greatness can be only relative ; and, for us, everything is only proportional; but, at th e sam e time, and for the sam e reason, we m ust have been gif ted with so me positive m eans of demonstrating His genera tive inf luence in all creatures, and His restorative in fluence in ourselves; and of show ing, by the fact itself, and not by books, the exclusive supremacy of the Being of beings, and the effective relations which the Word contin ually s eeks to estab lish with us. - 213 -"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

This intelligence cam e to m e after having heard a celebrated Professor say th at the sublim e was indefinable. I have sin ce read in the works of the sam e Profes sor “what is beautiful, or great, or strong, adm its the m ore or less ; the sublim e does not”, etc. I here s aw that our ideas coincid ed, except th at I am persuaded that what we both believe of the sublim e may be extended to the other qualit ies, virtues, &c., which he excludes, as well; for, in God only these things ar e po sitive ; and the W ord is the universal proclaim er of these positiv e sublim ities. I m ay here add an im portant rem ark, which is, that nothing can r eally app ear to us sublim e, but by communicating to us an extract of what passes in the superior, divine region, which is th e source of all sublim ities, the source o f everything. Augustus captivates us in saying : “Cinna, let us he friends; it is I who ask thee:” be cause th is is the positiv e and constant language of Eternal T ruth to Man; and the sane m ay be de duced from all other examples of the sublim e, in words or deeds. They do nothing but lift the ve il, and open the inexhaustible focus of all the sublim e acts and thoughts in which our being has its ro ots. N ow, if we are borne never so little towards that region, so as to bear its language sp oken, as this is the language of our own nature, it is not surprising that it should enchant us. We see Go d in every thing On this principle, which would deserve bei ng treated ad hoe, and is capable of being extended ad infinitum , by reason of the infinite number of subjects it em braces, and testim onies which depose in its favour, we can understand w hy Malebranche said that “we see every thing in God”; but we conceive also that his idea m ight be conveyed under a less gigantic form ; and, if not sim plified, at least b rought m ore within reach of our weak m inds, so as to shine up on them with a sof ter light than th at dazzling f lam e which blinds them . This form would be to say: “we really see God in every thing”; and, in truth, we should see nothing in any object whatever, if the Principle of all qualitie s, that is, God, did not move actively in it, either by Himself or His powers. Thus, sonorous bodies are without sound if de prived of communication with air, which must necessarily penetrate them if they have to g ive a sound. For the sam e reason, we m ay say that sound itself would not be sensible, or m anife st to us, if there were no universal generative sound in every partial sound; which is the true reason why music has always had such power over m en.    -    214    -"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

This is what leads learned societies into unbelief at last , after keeping them so long in doubt. But they are no longer w ise and prudent, if th ey f orbid us the use of the second kind of reason; for this, on the contrary, is the defender of Truth.

The nature of desire: t he principle of movement Desire results only from the separation or distinction between two substances, analogous in their essences and properties; and, when m en of m axims say that we cannot desire what we do not know, they prove th at, when we desire a th ing , there m ust necessarily be in us a po rtion of it, which therefore cannot be considered as unknown to us .

I m ay add, that desire is the pr inciple of all m ove ment, and th erefore an incontestable f act that m ove ment and desire are in proportion to each other; and that, from the First Being who, being the first desire, the divine One, or Un iversal desire, is also thereby the m otive of move ment itself – to the Stone, which is withou t move ment, because without desire.

On the one hand, the splendid natural destiny of Man is, that he can only really and radically d esire what alo ne can really and radi cally produce all things. This only thing is the desire of God : whatever else at tracts m an, he is but its slave or plaything; he does not desire it. Then, the greatness of his m inistry is, that he cannot act really and radi cally, except under the authority which alone is equitable, good, consistent , effective, and in confor mity with the Eternal Desire, and which is co mmunicated to him positiv ely ev ery mom ent.

What m ight we then not expect from this desire, in another order, and from that sacred want, of which the Most High com posed our essence? Listen, O Man! Your body is a continual e xpression of the desire of Nature, and your soul is a continual expression of the desire of God. God cannot be an instant without desiring som ething; and He cannot have a desire whic h you m ay not know, sin ce you ought to m anifest them all. Try, then, continually to study the desi res of God, that you be not som e day treated as an unprofitable servant. Difficulties of our re-union with God But there is a high reason why our re-union with God, from whom we ar e separated, is made so laborious; and this reason, which explains why we are obliged to act so forcibly and p erseveringly to reach God , is grounded on two difficulties The first is, that since the great Fall w e ar e in a real prison, which is our body, which ought to have been our preservati ve; and, instead of di minishing th e weight of thei r shackles, to the best of their m eans and abilities, most m en help their souls to becom e of the sam e nature as their prisons, by m aterializing them selves as they do. Thus the hum an soul having thereby becom e prison itself, we m ay judge what its lamentable cond ition at pres ent m ust be. The second difficulty, which is of im mense we ight, is that G od, like all other beings, concentrates Hi mself; it is that, by His own cen tral attraction, He tends continually towards Hi mself, and to separate from all that is not He; it. is that, by this m eans, He m akes Him self continually a world apart, shut up in His own Universal Sphe rical Enve lop e; the f orm we see taken by all particular worlds, and all bodies, down to globules of water and m ercury, which also take this form of envelope.

The great efforts we must m ake for this m ay be im agined, if we ref lect tha t all these world s, concentrating them selves, each in itself, tend co ntinually to separa te fro m each other. Yet we m ust not be discouraged; for this di vine world, which tends to conc entra te itse lf, also tends to universalize itself, becau se it is All, o r at leas t, sh ould be All; th is is its rig ht. Thus our labour, well understood, would have for its m ain object to attenuate all these false worlds with which we incessan tly surround ourselves, and allow them to dissolv e; becau se the universal, or divine world, would naturally take their place, as all places belong to it ; and these results would be both prom pt and facile, since we shoul d therein concur with the tendency of that Universal W orld itse lf. Now, what is the true sp ecific for accom plishi ng this m arvellous work of attenuating the false worlds which surround us, or which we create for ourselves every day, and opening the divine world which would fain take their place? I ask again, was it not for you, the m inisters of sacred thing s, to teach u s what this s pecific is, an d prove to u s that it con sists in the v irtues of the Word? Yes, the Eternal Word raises its voice, and acts on ly to exterm inate these worlds of illus ion, th ese Titans which scale heaven daily, a nd to cause the divine an d real world, whose organ and principle the Word is, to reign over all.

Although we waste our words daily in innum erable secondary occupations, and upon inferior objects, which do not at all advance us in the true Spiritual Ministry of Man, yet, if we do not exceed the m easure of our wants, or depart from justice, these very occupations m ay be useful to us as preservatives. In fact, the num erous diversi ons, affections, and attractions, suggested to us daily by the labours and cares of life, whether physical, or social and politic al, are so m any succours which are continually presented to us, to stop us on the brink of our precipi ces; without which our spirits m ight plunge in at any m oment.

For want of distinguishing between these tw o kinds of optim ism, reasoners, or rather unreasoners, have stammered so m uch about goo d and evil. We all descend from the prim itive optim ism; we all tend to return to it, but do not allow ourselves tim e to make the journey; and, in spite of the inconsistency, we persist in thinking that we have arrived, while we are only on the way.

Our understanding or intelligence is opened onl y after our inner be ing has experienced the first sentim ents of its own exis tence. This is known at the ag e when man begins to think.

In a m ore advanced age, the sap rises forcib ly to the region of our understanding; and, at this m oment, we have most need of guardians to direct its course, and preserve us from the dangers of its im petuosity; for, without m uch care, our m oral centre would be soon darkened or deteriorated. Then it is that the savans put id eas before m orals, which they m ake to depend upon them ; as the y also m ake ideas to depend on sensation and outward objects. But, if this moral centre of sentim ent and affection has the in itiativ e by n atura l right, it follows that every thing must return to it at last; as we see that the food we take fulfils its object, and is useful to us, only so far as its juices and properties are conveyed into our blood, the focus of our life. We m ust confess that all the flashes of in telligence which m en acquire by reasoning, are of use only so far as they pene trate th e m oral f ocus, whither th ey bring whatever property they possess. It is a tribute and hom age which they a ll have to render to this source, com ing to bear witness, by the fact itself , to the nature of their relations with it. In short, the understanding m ay aid us to recognize the fruits of the secondary optim ism which surround us in abundance, but the moral prin ciple m ay enable us to feed upon those of the prim itive op tim ism : such are the serv ices which the stewards of th e W ord m ight render us. Will the devil cease to be evil ? Thinkers, w ho believe in the universal source of love, m ay hence conceive how all things must term inate f or the m an of desire, in Love and the W ord.

This word is an abuse. God m ay ha ve said to several; “I choose you from your m other' s wom b”, and “before the world was”; but it was m an's spirit w hich clo thed this e lection with the word predestination; the weak ha ve still further altere d its m eaning, and the fanatical abused it. From his origin, Man m ight have said that he was predestinated to m anife st the Divine Being; and yet he has not m anifest ed it.

Som etimes even he feels him self move d with holy aspirations, leading him to believe that he m ight, by faith, s ucceed in realizing som e part of this sublim e work, and then he is filled with joy. B ut when he enquires scrupulously on this point, this is the answer he receives. God rules over all in patience, love, and wisdom All God' s ways are ways of l ove; the powers of God are, in truth, without lim it, and can do all things , except wha t is con trary to love. No w it is in lov e th at God tem porizes; it is because He loves all things, th at He wills th at all sh all have the m eans and the tim e that a re r equisite to fill them selv es with Him, that no thin g m ay return to Him em pty of Him self . By doing violenc e to the process and to time, He m ight, certainly, cause all the dark and false appearances which hold the sp irit cap tive, to disappea r; b ut He m ight thereby caus e this captiv e spir it to disappear likewis e, if it is not y et satura ted with the div ine tinc ture. No w this tin ctu re can pen etrate on ly by degrees if it were to do so suddenly, and all at once, it would push the spirit into extrem es beyond its strength, and whic h it could not resist. Thus, the long suffering of God te mpers even the designs we form for the advancem ent of His kingdom ; thus the m an of de sire, whatever his zeal m ay be, can walk in the ways of wisdom , only in so far as he is pene tra ted with the s entim ent of that universal love which disposes al l things gently; and when he feels strongly m oved to “m ake straight the crooked ways”, he m ust carry his desires into the bos om of Eternal Love, who alone can know what is b est fo r the accomplishm ent of His own wise and benef icent d ivine will; h e must retire into the depths of his heart, and there, m oaning like a dove, sigh in silence for the extension of the kingdom of the W ord and of Life; he m ust there traveil in pain and patient waiting, and never forget that if, thro ugh guilty m an, evil floo ded the world, it can b e only through m an m ade righteous that the re ign of goodness can recover its place. He m ust, in a word, take care lest he listen only to his own impruden ce, blind to his own darkness, privations, and well atte sted im potence, while he fancies he listens only to ju stic e, and that he has a right to exact from God m ore than his present m ission perm its him even to beg from Hi m. Let him then reflect that God' s continual o ccupation is to separate the pure from the im pure; and all tim e is consecrated to this great work. This is what He does with us from the mom ent of our birth, even of our incorporation, si nce, from that instant, He seeks gradually to deliver our souls from their prisons; and yet He accom plishes this work only at the end of our lives: and even then it depends upon how we have lived. The Spirit of Wisdom, and Spirit of Charity, which should animate men We have seen, m ore than once, that the sp irit of the divine operation, on m an and the universe, is a perpetual sacrific e, a continual devotion of the Wo rd, sacrif icing itself incessantly, to substitu te the div ine su bstance in all cre atur es, for tha t whic h is the ir d isquiet tend to rm ent.

And we should be wise, not from virtue only, but from equity, and regard for the title w e bear, as well as for the honour of Hi m who granted it to us, and whom we are commissioned to represent. If all these motives were insufficient to m ake us wise, then w e ought to be so out of charity to o ther creatu res and region s which are related to u s, since we cannot cease to be wise without causing them to die, instead of giving th em the life which they expect at our hands. Now, if we are not sufficiently elevated to g ive th em life, let us, at least, not so debase ourselves as to occasio n their death . Happy will it b e when we are able to rise a d egree; for, from that mom ent, all virtues will flow out of us, and we shall, from duty, prom ote the happiness of all creatures. The wise m an works for his own repose, when he daily wipes out the stains which darken Man since h is sin ; and seeks to cause the fountai n of life, which alon e can give him peace, to descend into him . This is the term to which ev ery m an who would be just , m ust tend. The m an of Charity goes farther ; he is not content with his own happiness, he wants the happiness also of what is not him self ; and here this spirit of charity has two distin ct ch aracters, on e spiritual, one divine. By the former, m an seeks the peace of his fe llow crea tures ; by the la tter, he seeks to make even the W ord itself keep its sabbath, and here it is that m any are called, but very few chosen. Ought not you, O m inisters of holy things, to have taught us these truths, which are so weighty and so little known? For, w ho, here belo w, believes that we are the great overseers of God' s domains, comm iss ioned to work for His repo se? Alas, it m ay be said that m an labours for the very opposite, as if he sought only the en em y's repose; whilst we ought to be occupied altogether in healing the wounds which he incessantly m akes in all regions and things; and everything shows that we m ay attain this high empl oym ent by attaching ourselv es in spirit and in truth to the m inistry of the Word; for if there is, on the one hand, a downward progression of abom inations of m an and his enem y, from the be ginning of the world, ther e is also an ascending progress ion of divine ric hes develop ed bef ore us since the sa me epoch, and which will not cease to be developed ti ll th e e nd of tim e.

Wonderful revelations of Wisdom, no twithstanding t he hardness of Man There are such grand m anifestations of th e W ord in the world, independently of trad ition s, and independ ently of the superb tab leau of Nature, that, when I look at these grand openings which W isdom in her bounty has disclose d to som e of Her servants, I cannot contain my astonishm ent at so much prodigality! I m ight be alm ost tem pted to believe that she does not know the state of brutality, ignorance, and gross ha rdness, in which m en a re steeped, in regard to the progress of truth, and th e fecundity of the spirit. In fact, in spite of her univ ersal oversight, I beli eve she does n ot percei ve the lapses and wickedness of m en, till they f ill up their d ivers f alse m easur es; bec ause then this extr em e deviation from right pene trates to the order of the Most High and stim ulates Justice, w hich otherwise w ould like to rest eter nally in its covering of Love. The habitua l state of God and spir its, in rega rd to m en, is to b eliev e them less ev il tha n they are; because, as God and spirits inhabit the abode of order, peace, v irtue, and goodness, they convey this colouring of perfecti on, which is their perpetual elem ent, to all that exists. Though they be deceived, in som e sort, continually by the oft-repeated abuses of m ankind, they do not the less lavish new favours upon them the next m inute; a truth of which the two Testam ents of the Jews and the Chris tians presen t an uninterrup ted chain of evidences; a truth which ceases to surprise when we gain an idea of the eternal ge nerative Root, which neve r ceases renewing itself. This m anner of God and spirits towards m an is not contrary to that oversight which they continually exercise over him to preserve him , to warn him , and guide him, in the ways which Wisdom m ay open for him ; because these are a ll works of love and beneficence, and their natural element. They always begin with him in this way, far from suspecting evil in him; and he m ust be com pletely bound up in disorders for them so far to see it as to leave him to him self and the consequences of his faults; and even then they are not long bef ore they give him fresh m arks of atten tion an d atta chm ent. - 231 -"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.

The action of God, and that of Man, are bound together, and ought ever to be sim ultaneous. Man is spirit, God is spirit; Man has the power to say to God : We are both spirits: let our action be co-ordinate! Man m ay, under the eye of God, assist at the oscillation of th e pendulum which regulates the move ments of the different regions of being; he is appoi nted to direct it. Do all in concert with God; brin g every faculty into s ubjection, in prayer without ceasing. Let m an see here whether he ought ever to allow him self anything whatsoever but in concert with God. Jacob Boehm e has said that even a desire was a sin. If a desire which is not shared in by God is a sin, a thought which is not of God is a snare; a pr oject which is not from God, is an usurpation of His rights; an action which is not of God, is a robbery committed upon His univers al activity; a single m ovem ent which is not of God is a crim e of ill-judged am bition. Before all, Man ought to say to all his facultie s, properties, and for ms: “I, as father and chief of the fa mily, comm and you ea ch to atte nd to your functions in m e, that whenever Universal O rder m ay com e, it m ay fi nd m e ready. Be not an instant without contributing by your vigilance and activity to m aintain order in m e; use your powers cons tantly in this special work; you are creatures of action; as for me, I have on ly to em ploy my will, because I am the im age of my Principle”. O Man, your degradation even does not dispense you from this perpetuity of prayer.    -    238    -"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Man: His Tr ue Nature & Mi nistry, L.-C. de Saint-M artin  tra ns.
