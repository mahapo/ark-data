CHAP TER I Begi nnings of a Bull- fight It was the Sunda y afte r East er, and the last bull- fight of the seas on in Mexico City. Four speci al bul ls had been brough t over from Spain for the occ asion, since Spani sh bul ls are more fiery than Mexic an. Perhaps it is the altitud e, per haps just the spir it of the wes tern Contine nt whi ch is to bla me for the lack of 'pep' , as Owen put it, in the nativ e anim al. Alth ough Owen, who was a gre at soc ialist , disa pprove d of bull- figh ts, 'We have never seen one. We sha ll hav e to go,' he said. 'Oh yes, I think we must see it,' said Kate. 'And it's our last cha nce,' said Owen."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Away he rushed to the place where they sold tickets, to book sea ts, and Kate went with him . As she came int o the street , her heart sank . It was as if some lit tle person inside her were sul king and resi sting. Neit her she nor Owen spoke much Spanish, there was a flus ter at the ticket place, and an unpl easant indiv idual came forw ard to talk Americ an for them. It was obv ious they ought to buy tickets for the 'Sh ade.' But they want ed to econom ize, and Owe n said he preferre d to sit amo ng the crow d, the refore , agai nst the resi stance of the tick et man and the onlo okers, they bought reser ved seats in the 'Sun.' The show was on Sunday after noon. All the tra m-cars and the frig htful little Ford omnibu ses called camions were labell ed Tore ro, and were surgi ng awa y towa rds Chapulte pec. Kate felt that sudd en dar k feel ing, that she didn 't wan t to go. 'I'm not very keen on going, ' she said to Owen . 'Oh, but why not ? I don't believe in them on princi ple, but we' ve neve r seen one, so we shall HAVE to go.' Owen was an Amer ican, Kate was Iri sh. 'Never having seen one' mean t 'hav ing to go.' But it was Americ an log ic rat her than Iri sh, and Kate only let hers elf be overc ome. Vill iers of cour se was keen. But then he too was American , and he too had never seen one , and being younge r, mor e than anybo dy he HAD to go. They got into a Ford taxi and went . The buste d car career ed awa y down the wide dismal street of asp halt and sto ne and Sunda y drea riness . Sto ne bui ldings in Mexico have a peculi ar har d, dry drea riness . The taxi drew up in a side street under the big iron scaff olding of the stadiu m. In the gutters , rath er lou sy men were sellin g pulq ue and sweets , cake s, fru it, and grea sy foo d. Crazy motorcar s rush ed up and hob bled away. Little soldi ers in washe d-out cotton unif orms, pinky drab, hung around an ent rance. Abov e all loomed the networ k iron frame of the huge , ugly stadi um. Kate felt she was goin g to prison. But Owen excited ly sur ged to the entran ce tha t corr espond ed to his ticket. In the dept hs of him, he too didn 't wan t to go. But he was a born American , and if anyt hing was on show, he had to see it. That was 'Life.' The man who took the tickets at the entr ance, sudden ly, as they were passi ng in, stood in front of Owen, put both his hand s on Owen 's che st, and pawe d down the front of Owen 's bod y. Owen star ted, bridled , tran sfixed for a momen t. The fell ow sto od asi de. Kate remai ned petrifie d. Then Owen jerked into a smil ing composur e as the man waved them on.

They dropp ed dow n the concre te ste ps til l they were only three tier s from the bottom. That was their row. They were to sit on the concre te, with a loop of thick iron betwee n each numbe red seat. This was a reser ved place in the 'Sun.' Kate sat gingerl y betw een her two iron loops, and looked vaguely arou nd. 'I think it's thrillin g!' she said . Like most modern peopl e, she had a will- to-hap piness . 'Isn 't it thrill ing?' cried Owen, whose will- to-happ iness was almo st a mania. 'Don' t you think so, Bud?' 'Why , yes, I thi nk it may be,' sai d Vill iers, non- committa l. But then Villier s was young, he was only over twenty , whil e Owen was over forty. The younger gener ation calcul ates its 'ha ppines s' in a more busine ss-lik e fash ion. Villie rs was out after a thril l, but he was n't going to say he'd got one till he'd got it.

'Su pposin g we try to protec t our extrem ity on this concrete --' and thou ghtful ly he folded his rain- coat and laid it along the conc rete ledge so that both he and Kate could sit on it. They sat and gaz ed aro und. They were early. Patche s of people mott led the conc rete slope opposit e, lik e erup tions.

The lower tiers were reserve d, so the bulk of the people sat in the mid- way levels, and gentry like our trio were more or less isol ated. But the audience was already a mob , most ly of fattis h town men in blac k tigh t suit s and little straw hats, and a mixin g-in of the dark -faced labou rers in big hats. The men in black suits were prob ably employe es and clerk s and factor y hand s. Some had broug ht thei r wome n, in sky- blue chi ffon with brown chiffon hats and fac es powd ered to look like white marshm allows . Som e were famil ies with two or thr ee chi ldren. The fun began. The game was to snatch the har d stra w hat off some fell ow's head, and sen d it skimmin g away down the slope of huma nity, where some smart bounder down below would catch it and send it skimming acros s in another direc tion. There were shouts of jeer ing pleasure from the mass, which rose alm ost to a yel l as seve n stra w hats were skimmi ng, meteor- like, at one moment acros s the slope of peo ple. 'Loo k at that!' said Owen. 'Isn't that fun!' 'No, ' said Kate, her little alter ego speaking out for onc e, in spit e of her wil l-to- happine ss. 'No, I don't like it. I really hate commo n peop le.' As a socia list, Owen disappr oved, and as a hap py man , he was disc oncert ed. Because his own rea l self , as far as he had any left , hate d comm on row diness just as muc h as Kate did. 'It' s awfu lly smart though!' he said, trying to laug h in sympath y with the mob. 'There now, see tha t!' 'Yes , it's quite smart , but I'm glad it' s not my hat ,' sai d Vill iers. 'Oh, it's all in the game,' said Owen largely. But he was uneas y. He was wearing a big straw hat of nati ve mak e, cons picuou s in the com parati ve iso lation of the lowe r tier s. After a lot of fidgeti ng, he took off this hat and put it on his knees . But unfort unatel y he had a very definite ly bal d spot on a sunbur nt head . Behi nd, above, sat a dense patch of peop le in the unreserv ed sect ion. Alread y they were throwi ng thi ngs.

He gla red round coldly, like a bird that would stab"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"with its beak if it got the chance , but which would fly away at the firs t real menac e. 'How I det est them!' said Kate. A diversio n was create d by the ent rance, oppos ite, of the milita ry band s, wit h thei r silv er and brass instr uments under their arms. Ther e were three sets. The chief band climbed and sat on the righ t, in the big bare tract of concrete reser ved for the Auth oritie s. These musician s wore dark grey uniform s trim med with rose colou r, and made Kate feel almost reassur ed, as if it were Ital y and not Mexico City. A silv er ban d in pale buff uni forms sat oppo site our par ty, high up across the hollow distan ce, and stil l a third 'm sica' threaded away to the left, on the remote scattered � hill side of the amphit heatre . The newsp apers had said tha t the Pres ident would attend . But the Preside nts are scar ce at bull- figh ts in Mexico , nowa days. Ther e sat the bands, in as much pomp as they could muster, but they did not begin to play. Grea t crow ds now patch ed the slope s, but ther e were still bare tracts , espe cially in the Auth oritie s' sect ion. Only a littl e dist ance above Kate's row was a mass of peop le, as it were imp ending ; a very unc omfort able sensati on. It was thr ee o'c lock, and the crow ds had a new diver sion. The band s, due to strike up at three, still sat there in lordl y fash ion, soundin g not a note . 'La m sica! La m sica!' shouted the mob, with the voice of mob � � auth ority. They were the People, and the revo lution s had been thei r revo lution s, and they had won them all. The bands were their band s, pre sent for the ir amu sement . But the bands were mil itary bands, and it was the army whi ch had won all the revo lution s. So the revolut ions were THEIR revo lution s, and they were present for their own glo ry alo ne.

At length, at its own leisur e, the bands in grey wit h dark rose faci ngs struck up: cri sp, martial, smart . 'Tha t's fine!' said Owen. 'But that's really good! And it's the firs t time I've heard a good band in Mex ico, a band with any back bone.' The music was smart, but it was brief. The band see med scarcely to have start ed, when the piece was over. The musician s took their inst rument s from their mouth s with a ges ture of dism issal. They play ed jus t to say the y'd played, making it as short as possible .

Wher eupon, at some giv en sig nal, the mas ses in the middle, unre served seats sudde nly burst and rush ed dow n on to the lowest , rese rved seats. It was a crash like a burst reservo ir, and the popu lace in blac k Sund ay sui ts pou red down rou nd and about our asto nished , frig htened trio. And in two minut es it was over.

You don' t elbo w your neig hbour if he' s got a pist ol on his hip and a knif e at his bel ly. So all the seats in the lowe r tier s fill ed in one rush, like the flow ing of water . Kate now sat amo ng the crowd . But her seat, fortuna tely, was above one of the track -ways that went round the aren a, so at lea st she woul d not have anybody sitti ng bet ween her kne es. Men went uneasil y back and forth along this gangway past the fee t, want ing to get in next their frien ds, but neve r vent uring to ask . Thre e seat s away , on the sam e row, sat a Polis h bols hevist fello w who had met Owen . He leaned over and asked the Mexi can next to Owen if he might chang e seat s with him. 'No,' said the Mexican. 'I'l l sit in my own seat.'

'I hope they won 't sit on MY feet, ' said Kate anxiou sly. 'We won't let them,' said Villiers , with bird- like decisio n. 'Why don' t you shove him off, Owe n? Shove him off? ' And Villie rs gla red at the Mexican fello w ensc onced betwee n Owen 's legs . Owe n flus hed, and lau ghed uncomfo rtably . He was not good at shov ing people off.

He quickl y brou ght his feet toge ther under the man 's sin king posteri or, so the individ ual subs ided uncomfo rtably on to a pai r of boots, and at the same time felt a han d shov ing him quie tly but dete rmined ly on the shoulder . 'No! ' Vill iers was say ing in good Americ an. 'This place is for my FEET ! Get off! You get off !' And he con tinued , quie tly but very empha ticall y, to push the Mexi can's should er, to remov e him."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Mexica n half raise d hims elf, and loo ked round murderou sly at Vill iers. Physi cal violence was being offered , and the only ret ort was death. But the young American 's fac e was so col d and abstra ct, only the eyes showing a prim itive, bird- like fire, that the Mexi can was nonplu ssed. And Kate's eyes were blazing with Irish contemp t. The fellow strug gled with his Mexi can city-bre d infe riorit y comp lex.

'Don 't you wonde r who was his tail or?' she ask ed, with a flicker in her voice. Vill iers looked at the femal ish black coat of the Mexican, and made an arch grimace at Kat e. 'I should say he hadn' t one. Perh aps did it himself .' 'Ver y like ly!' Kate laughed venomo usly."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"It was too much.

'App arentl y not yet, unfortu nately ,' he said, with some constrai nt, turn ing his nose away again from the Mex ican, who was usin g him as a sort of chair- back. Ther e was an exc lamati on.

They went round the aren a, the n took up their posts, sentry- wise, on eit her side the tunn el ent rance throug h whic h they had come in. In marched a lit tle column of four torea dors wearing tight unifo rms plas tered with silver embroi dery. They divide d, and march ed smar tly in oppos ite directio ns, two and two, around the ring, till they came to the place facin g the sectio n of the Aut horiti es, where they made their salute . So this was a bull-fig ht! Kate already felt a chill of disgust. In the sea ts of the Authorit ies were ver y few people , and certai nly no sparkli ng lad ies in high tortoi se-she ll com bs and lace mant illas. A few comm on-loo king people, bourg eois with not much tast e, and a cou ple of offic ers in unifo rm. The Pre sident had not come . Ther e was no gla mour, no cha rm. A few commonp lace people in an expa nse of concr ete were the elect , and below, four grotes que and effe minate -looki ng fel lows in tigh t, orn ate clothes were the hero es. With their rather fat pos terior s and their squiff s of pigt ails and the ir cle an-sha ven faces, they looked like eunuchs, or wome n in tight pants, these precio us tor eadors . The last of Kate 's ill usions conce rning bull- fights came down with a flop. These were the darl ings of the mob! These were the gall ant toreador s! Gallant? Just about as gallant as ass istant s in a butch er's shop. Lady- killers ? Ugh ! Ther e was an Ah! of satisfac tion from the mob. Into the ring sudd enly rushed a smal lish, dun- coloured bull with long flourish ing horn s. He ran out, blindly, as if from the dark, probably think ing that now he was free. Then he sto pped short, seeing he was not free , but surrou nded in an unknown way. He was utte rly at a los s. A toreador came forwar d and switch ed out a pin k cloa k like a fan not far from the bull' s nose . The bull gave a playf ul lit tle pran ce, neat and prett y, and charg ed mil dly on the cloak. The tore ador switche d the cloak over the ani mal's head, and the neat litt le bul l trot ted on round the ring, looking for a way to get out.

The bull in the gangwa y trot ted inquirin gly round till he came to an opening on to the arena again. So back he trotte d into the ring . And back into the gang way vaulted the servants , wher e they stood agai n to look on. The bull trotted waver ingly and somewhat irrit ated. The toreado rs wave d thei r cloa ks at him, and he swerve d on. Till his vague cour se too k him to whe re one of the hors emen with lances sat moti onless on his hors e. Inst antly, in a pang of alar m, Kat e noti ced that the horse was thic kly blindfol ded with a black cloth. Yes, and so was the hor se on which sat the other picad or. The bull trotted suspi ciousl y up to the motion less horse bearing the rider with the lon g pole ; a lean old horse that would never move till Doomsd ay, unless someone shove d it. O shades of Don Quixot e! Oh four Spanis h hors emen of the Apoc alypse ! Thi s was surely one of them . The picado r pull ed his feebl e hors e roun d slow ly, to face the bull, and slowly he leaned forward and shoved his lance- point into the bull 's sho ulder. The bull, as if the horse were a great wasp that had stung him deep, suddenly lower ed his head in a jerk of surpr ise and lifted his horns straigh t up into the hors e's abdomen. And with out more ado , over went horse and rider, like a totter ing monu ment upset. The rider scramb led from und er the horse and went running away with his lance. The old horse, in comp lete dazed amazeme nt, struggle d to rise, as if overcom e with dumb incomp rehens ion. And the bull , with a red place on his shou lder welling a tri ckle of dark blood , stoo d look ing around in equa lly hopeless amaze ment. But the wound was hurt ing. He saw the queer sight of the horse half reare d from the ground, tryin g to get to its feet. And he smel led blood and bowe ls. So rather vaguel y, as if not quite knowi ng wha t he ought to do, the bull once more lowered his head and push ed his sharp , flou rishin g horn s in the hor se's belly, workin g them up and down insid e ther e with a sor t of vague satisfa ction. Kate had never been taken so compl etely by sur prise in all her life . She had still cherish ed som e idea of a gallan t show .

And even Villiers hid his joy in a new sens ation under a mann er of comple te qui et com posure . When coffe e came she looked at the two men at the other table, and at the two men at her own table. 'I'v e had enough of canaille , of any sor t,' she said . 'Oh, I und erstan d, per fectly ,' sai d Owen . Afte r dinn er, she went to her room , and throug h the night she could not sleep, but lay lis tening to the nois es of Mexico City, then to"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"the silenc e and the strange, grisl y fear that so oft en cre eps out on to the darkne ss of a Mexi can night. Away inside her, she loat hed Mexico City. She even fea red it. In the daytime it had a cert ain spell- -but at night, the underne ath grisline ss and evil came forth . In the mor ning Owen also ann ounced that he had not slept at all. 'Oh, I nev er sle pt so well since I was in Mexi co,' said Villiers , with a tri umphan t look of a bird that has just pecke d a good mor sel from the garbage -heap. 'Loo k at the fra il aes thetic youth !' sai d Owen , in a hollo w voic e. 'His frail ty and his aesthet icism are both bad signs , to me,' said Kate omino usly. 'And the youth. Surel y that 's ano ther!' said Owen, with a dead laug h. But Villie rs onl y gave a lit tle snort of cold, pleas ed amu sement . Some one was call ing Miss Les lie on the telepho ne, said the Mexic an cham bermai d. It was the onl y pers on Kat e knew in the capi tal- -or in the Dis trito Federa l--a Mrs Nor ris, widow of an English amba ssador of thirty years ago. She had a big , pond erous old house out in the villa ge of Tlacol ula. 'Yes ! Yes ! Thi s is Mrs Nor ris. How are you? That 's rig ht, that 's rig ht. Now, Mrs Lesl ie, won't you come out to tea this afte rnoon and see the garden ? I wish you woul d. Two frie nds are coming in to see me, two Mexicans: Don Ram n Carrasco and General � Viedma. They are both CHARMING men, and Don Ram n is a great � scho lar. I assu re you , they are both entirely the excepti on amo ng Mexi cans. Oh, but ENT IRELY the exceptio n! So now, my DEA R Mrs Lesl ie, won't you come with your cousin? I wish you would .' Kate remem bered the little General ; he was a good deal sma ller than hers elf. She remember ed his erect , aler t litt le fig ure, somethi ng bird like, and the face with eyes slantin g unde r arch ed eye brows, and the little black tuft of an imperial on the chin : a face wit h a pecu liar Chinese sugge stion, witho ut bei ng Chi nese in the least, real ly. An odd, detac hed, yet coc ky lit tle man, a true little Indi an, speaking Oxfor d Engl ish in a rap id, low, mus ical voice, with extra ordina rily gentle intona tion. Yet those black, inhuma n eyes ! Till this minute she had not reall y been able to rec all him to hers elf, to get any sharp impressi on. Now she had it. He was an Indi an pur e and simple . And in Mexico, she knew, there were mor e gene rals than soldiers . The re had been three genera ls in the Pull man coming down from El Paso, two, more or less educat ed, in the 'drawi ng-roo m', and the third, a rea l peas ant Indian, trav elling with a friz zy hal f-whit e woma n who looked as if she had fall en int o a flour- sack, her face was so deep in powder, and her friz zy hai r and her brown silk dre ss so douche d with the white dust of it. Neither this 'Genera l' nor this woman had ever bee n in a Pull man before. But the Gen eral was sha rper than the woma n. He"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"was a tall wiry fellow with a redd ened pock- marked face and shar p litt le bla ck eye s. He follo wed Owen to the smoking- room, and watc hed with sha rp eye s, to see how ever ything was done. And soon he knew. And he would wipe his wash-bow l dry as nea tly as anybo dy. Ther e was someth ing of a rea l man about him. But the poor , half - whit e woma n, whe n she wanted the ladies' toile t, got lost in the passage and wailed aloud: I don't know where to go! No s adonde! � No s adonde!--until the General sent the Pullman boy to direct � her. But it had annoy ed Kat e to see thi s Gene ral and this woman eatin g chic ken and aspa ragus and jelly in the Pullman , payi ng fif teen peso s for a rath er poo r dinn er, when for a pes o-and- a-half apiec e they could have eaten a bett er mea l, and real Mexica n, at the meal- stop stati on. And all the poor, barefoo t peop le cla mourin g on the plat form, while the 'General ', who was a man of thei r own sort, nobl y swal lowed his asparagu s on the oth er sid e of the win dow- pane. But this is how they save the peop le, in Mexic o and elsewh ere. Some tough indiv idual scramb les up out of the squalo r and procee ds to save himself. Who pays for the aspar agus and jel ly and face- powd er, nobody asks, because every body knows. And so muc h for Mexica n gene rals: as a rule, a class to be stric tly avoi ded. Kate was aware of all this. She wasn't much interes ted in any sort of Mexican in office. There is so much in the world that one wants to avoid, as one wants to avoid the lice that creep on the unwas hed crow d. Bein g rath er lat e, Owe n and Kate bumped out to Tlaco lula in a Ford taxi . It was a long way, a long way thr ough the pec uliar squali d endi ngs of the town, then along the stra ight road between trees, into the valley. The sun of April was brillia nt, there were pil es of cloud about the sky , wher e the volcan oes would be. The valle y stre tched away to its sombre , atmo spheri c hill s, in a flat dry bed, parc hed except where there was som e crop being irrig ated. The soil seem ed str ange, dry, blackis h, art ificia lly wetted, and old. The tree s rose high, and hung bare bou ghs, or with ered shade. The buil dings were either new and alie n, lik e the Countr y Club , or crac ked and dila pidate d, wit h all the plaster fallin g off. The fall ing of thick plast er fro m crac ked building s--one could almos t hear it! Yell ow tra m-cars rushe d at express speed away down the fen ced- in car- lines, rushi ng rou nd tow ards Xochimi lco or Tlalp am. The asph alt road ran outsi de the se lin es, and on the asp halt rushed incr edibly dilap idated Ford omnibu ses, crowded with blank dark nati ves in dirty cotto n clot hes and big straw hats. At the far edge of the road , on the dus t-trac ks und er the trees , litt le donk eys under huge loa ds loi tered toward s the city, driven by men with black ened faces and bar e, bla ckened legs. Thre e-fold went the traffi c; the roar of the tram- trains , the clatte r of the auto mobile s, the strag gle of asses and of outs ide- seeming indi vidual s.

And dea d sile nce, like the blac k, por ous, absorpt ive lava rock. Save when the tram-car s batt ered past outside the solid wall . Kate went up the jet- like stone staircas e, thr ough the lea ther door s. Mrs Norr is cam e forw ard on the terrace of the uppe r pati o to receive her guests. 'I'm so glad, my dear, that you came. I shoul d have rung you up befo re, but I've had such trouble with my hear t. And the doctor want ing to send me dow n to a lower altit ude! I said to him, I'v e no patienc e!

Mrs Norris was an elde rly woman, rather like a conqu istado r hers elf in her bla ck sil k dres s and her little black shoulde r-shaw l of fine cash mere, with a short silk fringe , and her ornament s of black enam el.

From the first instant , Kate respe cted her for her isolati on and her dauntl essnes s. The worl d is made up of a mass of peop le and a few indivi duals. Mrs Norris was one of the few indi vidual s. True, she played her social game all the time. But she was an odd numb er; and all alone, she could give the even numbe rs a bad tim e. 'But come in.

In the dar k sitt ing- room tha t open ed on to the terra ce wer e visi tors: an old man in a black morning coat and whi te hai r and beard, and a woman in black cr pe-de-chine, with the inevitable hat � of her sor t upon her grey hair: a stiff satin turned up on three side s and with black ospreys under neath. She had the baby face and the faded blue eyes and the middle -west accent inevi table. 'Jud ge and Mrs Burlap. ' The third visito r was a youn gish man, very cor rect and not quite sure. He was Major Law, American military attach at the moment. � The three people eyed the newcomer s with cauti ous suspicio n. They migh t be shady. There are indeed so man y shad y peop le in Mexico that it is taken for granted , if you arr ive unannoun ced and unex pected in the capi tal, that you are probab ly und er an assume d name , and have some dirty game up your sleeve.

But when the child dies, the pare nts say: Ah, he will be an angelito ! So they cheer up and feel as if they had been giv en a present . Som etimes I thi nk the y enjo y it when their children die. Somet imes I think they would like to transfer Mexic o en bloc into Par adise, or whatever lies behi nd the walls of death. It wou ld be better there !' Ther e was a sile nce. 'But how sad you are!' said Kate, afraid . Do a Isabel was giving hurried orders to the manservant. � 'Who ever knows Mexico below the surface, is sad!' said Jul io Tous saint, rathe r sent entiou sly, over his blac k crav at. 'Wel l,' said Owe n, 'it seems to me, on the con trary, a gay count ry. A country of gay , irre sponsi ble children . Or rather , they WOULD be gay, if they wer e prop erly treated . If they had com fortab le hom es, and a sens e of real freedom. If they felt tha t they could contr ol thei r live s and their own country.

'It is pos sible that the Ind ian children are pure- blooded, and ther e is the con tinuit y of blood.

'They don't care abou t anyt hing. They eat food so hot with chi li, it burns holes in thei r insi des. And it has no nour ishmen t. They liv e in houses that a dog would be ashamed of, and they lie and shi ver with col d. But they don't DO anyt hing. They could make, easily , easi ly, a bed of maize leaves or sim ilar leaves. But they don't do it. They don' t do anythin g. They rol l up in a thin ser ape and lie on a thin mat on the bare ground , whet her it is wet or dry. And Mex ican nigh ts are cold.

They don't care a bit. 'And that is bad . I tell you, exc use me, but all, everyth ing, depe nds on the moment of coi tion.

Durin g the whirl of tal k, or of pass ionate decla ration , the servan ts had carri ed rou nd the food and wine. Do a Isabel, completely oblivious of the things that were � bein g said , watc hed and dire cted the ser vants with nervous anxie ty and excite ment, her hands with the ir old jewel lery trembli ng wit h agitation. Don Ram n had kept his eye on his guests' material � comf ort, at the same time listenin g, as it wer e, fro m the back of his head. His big bro wn eye s were inscr utable , his face impassi ve. But when he had anythi ng to say, it was always with a ligh t laug h and a teas ing accent. And yet his eyes broode d and smould ered with an incompr ehensi ble, unyield ing fire. Kate felt she was in the pre sence of men . Her e were men face to face not with death and self -sacri fice, but with the life- issue. She felt, for the firs t time in her life , a pang alm ost like fea r, of men who were passin g beyo nd wha t she knew, beyond her depth. Cipr iano, his rather short but int ensely black , curv ed eye lashes lowe ring over his dark eyes, watch ed his plate , only somet imes look ing up with a blac k, bri lliant glanc e, eit her at whoms oever was speaking, or at Don Ram n, or at Kate. His face was changeless and � inte nsely seriou s, ser ious almost with a touch of childish ness. But the curious blackn ess of his eyelash es lif ted so stran gely, with such intens e unco nsciou s male ness from his eyes , the moveme nt of his han d was so odd , quic k, lig ht as he ate , so easily a move ment of shoo ting, or of flashi ng a knife into the body of some adve rsary, and his dar k-colo ured lips were so helple ssly savage, as he ate or briefl y spok e, tha t her heart stood still. Ther e was some thing undeve loped and intense in him , the intens ity and the crud ity of the semi- savage. She could well understa nd the poten cy of the sna ke upo n the Aztec and Maya ima ginati on. Somethi ng smoo th, undevelo ped, yet vit al in this man sug gested the heavy- ebbi ng blo od of reptil es in his veins. That was wha t it was, the heav y-ebbi ng blo od of powerf ul rep tiles, the dragon of Mex ico. So that unconsci ously she shrank when his blac k, big , glit tering eyes turned on her for a moment. They were not, like Don Ram n's, � DARK eyes. They were black, as black as jewel s into which one coul d not look without a sen sation of fear. And her fasci nation was tinged with fear. She felt somewhat as the bird feels when the snak e is watchin g it. She wondered almost that Don Ram n was not afraid. Because she had � noti ced that usu ally, when an Indi an loo ked to a whi te man , both men stood back from actual contact , from actua l meet ing of each othe r's eyes.

'Do you think one can make this miracle come?' she asked of him. 'The mirac le is always there ,' he said, 'for the man who can pas s his hand through to it, to take it.' They finis hed dinner, and went to sit out on the ver anda, lookin g into the garden where the light from the house fell uncann ily on the blosso ming trees and the dark tufts of Yuc ca and the strange grea t writ hing trunks of the Laure l de India. Cipr iano had sat down next to her, smoki ng a cigaret te. 'It is a strange darkn ess, the Mex ican darknes s!' she said . 'Do you like it? ' he asked. 'I don't know yet,' she said . 'Do you?' 'Yes . Ver y much . I think I like best the tim e when the day is fall ing and the night coming on like som ething else. Then , one feel s more free, don't you think?

The sme ll of the flowers at nig ht may make one feel afrai d, but it is a goo d fear . One likes it, don't you thin k?' 'I am afra id of fear,' she said. He laughed short ly.

'No, ' said Kate. 'He was a very well- known man. He died only about ten yea rs ago . He was ver y rich , too, befor e the revolu tion. He had a big haci enda in Oaxa ca, with a very fine lib rary.

When I was a litt le boy I cam e runn ing to my father, when the Bishop was there, with somethin g in my hand s--so! '--and he made a cup of his hand . 'I don't rememb er. This is what they tell me.

And he lif ted the cup of his small , slen der, dark hands, as if to show Kate the creature . 'Wel l, the Bisho p was talkin g to my fath er, and he saw wha t I had got before my father did. So he told me at once, to put the scor pion in his hat- -the Bis hop's hat, no? Of cours e I did what he told me, and I put the scorp ion in his hat, and it did not bite me. If it had stung me I should have died, of cour se. But I didn't know , so I suppo se the alacr an was not interes ted. The Bishop was a very goo d man, very kind. He liked my fathe r, so he bec ame my god- father . The n he always took an inte rest in me, and he sent me to school, and then to Engla nd. He hope d I should be a priest. He alwa ys sai d that the one hop e for Mexico was if she had really fine nati ve pri ests.' He ended rather wistfu lly. 'And didn' t you want to beco me a priest? ' said Kate. 'No! ' he said sadly. 'No!' 'Not at all?' she aske d. 'No! When I was in England it was diffe rent from Mexico. Even God was differ ent, and the Bless ed Mar y. They wer e chan ged so much, I felt I did n't know the m any more. Then I came to understa nd bett er, and when I und erstoo d I didn't believe any more. I used to thin k it was the image s of Jesus, and the Virg in, and the Saints , that were doing everyt hing in the world. And the world seemed to me so stra nge, no? I couldn 't see that it was bad, becaus e it was all so ver y stra nge and myst erious , when I was a chi ld, in Mexic o. Only in England I lear ned about the laws of life, and some scien ce.

She could see the curious recoil into chasti ty, perhaps charac terist ic of the sava ge. And at the same tim e she felt the int ense masculi ne year ning, couple d with a cer tain male ferocity , in the man 's brea st. 'You r husb and was Jame s Joac him Leslie, the famous Irish leader?

Ther e was a poor littl e meal at exorbita nt pri ces, and whe n this was cleare d away , the attend ant came wit h a clash to make the beds, pull ing down the upper berth s. It was only eight o'clock, and the pass engers looke d up in rese ntment . But no good. The pug -faced Mexi can in charg e, and his smallpo x-pitt ed ass istant , inso lently came in between the seats, inserte d the key overhead , and brough t down the berth with a crash. And the Mexican passen gers humbly craw led away to the smoking- room or the toilet , like whipp ed dog s. At half- past eig ht eve rybody was silentl y and with intense disc retion going to bed. None of the collar- stud- snapping bustl e and 'homel y' fam iliari ty of the United States. Like subdu ed anim als they all crept in behind their green serge curtain s. Kate hated a Pul lman, the discreet indis cretio n, the horri ble near ness of othe r peop le, like so many larvae in so many section s, behi nd the green serge curta ins. Above all, the hor rible intima cy of the noi se of going to bed . She hated to undress, strug gling in the oven of her berth, with her elbow butting into the sto mach of the attend ant who was button ing up the green curtain outsi de. And yet, once she was in bed and could put out her light and rai se the window -blind , she had to admit it was bett er tha n a wagon- lit in Europe: and perhaps the best that can be done for peopl e who must trave l thro ugh the nigh t in trains.

Then the train stopped at a dark lit tle station on the rim of the slope, where men swathed in dark serap es hel d dusk y, rud dy lan terns that lit up no fac es at all, only dark gaps. Why did the train stay so long ? Was some thing wrong? At last they wer e goin g agai n. Under the moon she saw bey ond her a long downs lope of rock s and cactus , and in the dista nce below, the ligh ts of a town . She lay in her berth watchi ng the train wind slow ly dow n the wild, rugged slope . The n she dozed. To wake at a sta tion that looked like a quiet infern o, wit h dark face s comi ng nea r the window s, gli tterin g eyes in the half -light , wome n in their rebozos runni ng alo ng the train balan cing dishes of meat , tama les, tortill as on one hand, black- faced men with fruit and sweets , and all calling in a subdued , inte nse, hushed hubbub . Stra nge and glar ing, she saw eyes at the dark screen of the Pull man, sudden hands thrust ing up somet hing to sell . In fear, Kate dropp ed her windo w. The wire scree n was not enough. The platfo rm bel ow the Pullm an was all dark. But at the back of the train she could see the glare of the first -class windo ws, on the dark station . And a man selli ng swe et-mea ts-- Cajetas! Caje tas! La de Celaya ! She was safe ins ide the Pull man, with nothing to do but to liste n to an occa sional cough behin d the green curtai ns, and to feel the fain t bris tling appreh ension of all the Mexica ns in their dark bert hs. The dar k Pull man was full of a subdue d appr ehensi on, fear lest there might be some att ack on the train. She went to slee p and woke at a bright station : prob ably Quereta ro. The green trees looked theat rical in the elect ric light. Opales ! she heard the men call ing softly. If Owen had been there he wou ld have got up in his pyj amas to buy opals. The call would have been too strong . She slept fitful ly, in the shaken saloon , vagu ely aware of stati ons and the deep nig ht of the open cou ntry. Then she started from a comp lete sleep. The train was dea d stil l, no sound. Then a trem endous jerki ng as the Pullman was shunted. It must be Irap uato, where they branche d to the wes t. She would arrive at Ixtlahua can soon aft er six in the morn ing. The man woke her at daybre ak, before the sun had risen. Dry country with mesqu ite bushes, in the dawn: then green wheat altern ating with ripe wheat. And men already in the pale, ripen ed whe at reap ing with sic kles, cuttin g shor t litt le han dfuls from the sho rt stra w. A bright sky, with a bluis h shad ow on earth.

In the pow erful light of mor ning, under a turq uoise- blue sky, she gaze d at the hel pless- lookin g stat ion, railway lines , some stand ing truc ks, and a remote lifeles sness. A boy seiz ed the ir bag s and ran acro ss the lines to the stat ion yard, which was pave d with cobb leston es, but over grown with weeds. At one side stood an old tram -car with two mule s, lik e a relic. One or two men, swathed up to the eye s in scarlet blank ets, were crossing on silent white legs . 'Ado nde?' said the boy . But Kate went to see her big lugga ge tak en out . It was all ther e. 'Ori lla Hotel,' said Kate. The boy said the y must go in the tram- car, so in the tram- car they went .

The sto nes seemed dead, the tow n seem ed made of dead sto ne. The hum an lif e came with a slow , ster ile unwi llingn ess, in spit e of the low -hung power of the sun. At length they were in the plaza, where brilli ant trees flowered in a blaze of pure scarle t, and some in pur e lave nder, around the basi ns of milk- looking water . Mil ky-dim the water bubbled up in the basins , and women, blear y with sleep , unco mbed, came from under the dilapi dated arches of the port ales, and across the bro ken pave ment, to fil l thei r wate r-jars . The tram stopped and they got down . The boy got dow n with the bags , and told them they mus t go to the river to tak e a boat. They follo wed obedient ly dow n the smashe d pave ments, where every mome nt you might twist your ankle or bre ak you r leg.

The sens e of life ebbing away, leaving dry ruin. They came to the edge of the town, to a dusty, humpe d brid ge, a brok en wal l, a pale- brown stream flowing full.

She climbe d with Villi ers down the broke n bank to the rive r, and in a moment they were in the boat. Pale green willow- trees fringed from the earthen banks to the full er-flo wing, pale- brown water. The river was not very wide, betwe en dee p bank s.

There was a blue dimness in the lowe r air, and blac k wate r-fowl ran swiftly , unco ncerne dly back and forth from the rive r's edge, on the dry, baked banks that wer e tree less now, and wide r. They had enter ed a wide river, from the narr ow one . The blue ness and moi stness of the diss olved night seemed to linger unde r the scatte red pepper- trees of the far shore.

Bey ond the tree s and the level of the shores, big hills rose up to high, blunt poin ts, baked incredib ly dry , like biscu it.

The German -Mexic an own ers were not popul ar wit h the native s. An ange l from heave n woul d not have been popular, these years , if he had been known as the owner of pro perty. Howe ver, in 1921 the hote l was very modestl y open ed aga in, with an Americ an man ager. Towards the end of the year, Jos , son of the German-Mexican owner, � came to stay wit h his wife and chi ldren in the hotel , in the new wing. Jos was a bit of a fool, as most foreigners are, after the � firs t gene ration in Mexico.

'Wha t's amiss?' said Bell, who had built up Orilla, and had been twen ty yea rs on the lake. Then he noticed that two other men had hold of Jos . 'Come,' they � said . Ther e were five Mexica ns-- Indians, or half-Ind ians- -and the two capt ives. They went, the captives in slippers and shirtsl eeves, to the little offic e away at the end of the other part of the hotel , whic h had been the old ranch -house . 'Wha t do you wan t?' asked Bell. 'Giv e us the mon ey,' said the band its. 'Oh, all right,' said the American . The re wer e a few peso s only in the safe. He opened, showed them, and they took the money . 'Now give us the rest, ' they said. 'There is no more,' said the manager, in all sincerity; for Jos � had not confesse d to the tho usand pesos.

The hill was stony and steep, the going slow. Jos , a fat young man of twenty-eight, protested in � the feeble manne r of the wel l-to- do Mexi cans. At last they came to the top of the hill. Three men took Jos � apar t, lea ving Bell alone near a cactus clump. The moon shone in a perf ect Mexican heaven . Bel ow, the big lake glimmer ed fai ntly, stre tching its length toward s the west.

At the foot of the hill was the hacie nda, with the peon s asle ep in their huts. But what help was ther e in them? Jos and the three men had gone behind a cactus-tree that stuck up � stra ight like a great black bundle of poles, poised on one centr al foot , and cast a sharp , iron shado w. The Amer ican could hear the voic es, talking low and rapi dly, but cou ld not disti nguish the word s. His two guards drew away from him a little, to hea r what the others were saying , behi nd the cactu s. And the American , who knew the gro und he stood on and the sky that hung over him, felt again the blac k vibr ation of dea th in the air, the black thrill of the deat h-lust . Unm istaka ble he felt it seet hing in the air, as any man may feel it, in Mexi co. And the stra nge aborigin al fie ndishn ess, awake now in the five ban dits, comm unicat ed its elf to his blood. Loos ening his blanket, he listened tense ly in the moonligh t. And came the thud! thud! thud! of a machete striki ng wit h lust in a human body, then the strange voice of Jos : 'Perd neme!--Forgive � � me!' the murdere d man cried as he fell. The Americ an wai ted for no more. Droppi ng his blank et, he jumpe d for the cactus cover, and stooping , took the down- slope like a rabb it. The pis tol- shots rang out after him, but the Mexi cans don' t as a rule take good aim. His bedr oom slippers flew off, and bare foot, the man, thi n and light, sped down over the ston es and the cactus , down to the hote l. When he got down , he found everyon e in the hot el awa ke and shou ting. 'They are killing Jos !' he said, and he rushed to the telephone, � expe cting every moment the five bandits would be on him. The teleph one was in the old ranch -build ing, in the dining -room. Ther e was no ans wer- -no answ er-- no answe r. In her little bedroo m over the kitchen , the cook- woman, the traitres s, was yelli ng. Across in the new wing, a little distance away, Jos 's Mexican wife � was scream ing. One of the servant boys appear ed. 'Try and get the polic e in Ixtlahu acan,' said the American , and he ran to the new wing, to get his gun and to bar ricade the doors.

True, she her self had see n no horrors , apar t from the bull -fight . And she had had some exquis ite moments, as coming to this hotel in the boat . The nativ es had a cer tain mystery and beau ty, to her. But she cou ld not bear the unease, and the late st sens e of horror. True , the peons were poor. They used to work for twenty cents, Amer ican, a day; and now the stand ard price was fift y cent s, or one peso . But then in the old days they rec eived their wage all the year round . Now , only at harvest time or sowi ng tim e. No work, no pay. And in the long dry season, it was mostl y no work.

No, she could not go back to Europ e. And no! She ref used to take the hotel manager 's est imate of Quet zalcoa tl. How sho uld a hotel manage r judg e?-- even if he was not really an hotel manager, but a ranch -overs eer. She had see Ram n Carrasco, and Cipriano. And they were men.

Give me the myst ery and let the world live aga in for me! Kate cried to her own soul. And delive r me from man's automati sm. The sun rose, and a whitenes s of light played on the tops of the moun tains. The boat hugged the north shore, turning the promont ory on which the vil las had star ted so jaunt ily, twenty years ago, but now were lapsing back to wil dernes s. All was still and motionle ss in the lig ht. Sometim es on the little bare patches high up on the dry hills were white specks; birds ? No, men in thei r whit e cott on, peon s hoei ng. They were so tiny and so distin ct, they loo ked like whit e bird s sett led.

She took food from the bas ket, and ate a lit tle lunch, and doz ed. In this country she was afra id. But it was her soul more than her body that knew fear. She had real ized, for the firs t time , with fina lity and fat ality, what was the illu sion she lab oured under. She had thought that each individu al had a com plete self, a comp lete soul, an acco mplish ed I. And now she reali zed as plain ly as if she had turned into a new being, that this was not so. Men and women had incomple te sel ves, made up of bits ass embled toget her loos ely and some what haphaza rd. Man was not created ready -made. Men to-day were half- made, and wom en wer e half -made. Crea tures that exist ed and funct ioned with certain regul arity, but which ran off into a hopel ess jumble of inco nseque nce. Half -made, like insect s that can run fas t and be so busy and sudd enly grow wings, but whi ch are only winged grubs after all. A worl d full of half-mad e crea tures on two legs, eatin g food and degr ading the one myst ery left to them, sex. Spinni ng a great lot of words, buryin g them selves insid e the cocoon s of words and ide as that they spin round themsel ves, and ins ide the coco ons, mostly peri shing inert and overwhel med. Half -made creatu res, rarely more than half-res ponsib le and half- acco untabl e, act ing in terri ble swarms, like locusts . Awfu l thou ght! And with a collect ive insect- like will, to avoid the respon sibili ty of achiev ing any more perfe cted being or iden tity. The queer, rabid hate of bein g urge d on into purer self. The morbid fanat icism of the non- integra te. In the gre at see thing light of the lake, with the terrible blue- ribb ed mou ntains of Mexico beyond, she seemed swallo wed by some gris ly ske leton, in the cage of his deat h-anat omy. She was afra id, myst ically , of the man crouc hing there in the bows with his smoo th thig hs and suppl e loin s like a sna ke, and his black eyes watchin g.

' She did what she had been half-afr aid to do before; she offered them the oranges and sandwic hes still in the basket. And each of the men looked at her, the smoke- grey eyes loo ked her in the eye s, and the black eyes loo ked her in the eye s. And the man with the smok e-grey eyes, who was cun ninger than the other man, but also prou der, said to her with his eyes : We are living! I kno w your sex, and you kno w mine . The myste ry we are glad not to meddle with . You leave me my natur al hon our, and I thank you for the grac e. In his loo k, so quick and proud, and in his quiet Muchas gracias ! she heard the touch of male recogn ition, a man glad to ret ain his hono ur, and to feel the comm union of gra ce. Perhaps it was the Span ish word Gra cias! But in her soul she was think ing of the comm union of gra ce. With the black- eyed man it was the same. He was hum bler.

It looked peacef ul, delicate , almo st Jap anese. As she dre w near er she saw the beac h with the washing sprea d on the san d; the fleec y gree n will ow-tre es and peppe r-tree s, and the villas in fol iage and flow ers, hanging magen ta cur tains of bou gainvi llea, red dots of hibi scus, pink abundan ce of tall oleande r tree s; occ asiona l palm - tree s stic king out. The boat was ste ering round a ston e jett y, on which, in black lett ers, was pai nted an adve rtisem ent for moto r-car tyres. Ther e were a few seats , some deep fleecy trees growi ng out of the sand , a boot h for sellin g drin ks, a little prome nade, and white boats on a sand y beac h. A few women sitting under paraso ls, a few bathers in the water, and trees in fron t of the few villa s deep in green or blaz ing scarlet blosso ms. 'Thi s is very good,' thought Kate. 'It is not too savage, and not over -civil ized. It isn't broken, but it is rather out of repair . It is in contact with the world, but the world has got a very weak grip on it.' She went to the hotel, as Don Ram n had advised her. � 'Do you come from Orilla? You are Mrs Leslie? Don Ram n Carrasco � sent us a letter about you.' Ther e was a hous e. Kate pai d her boatme n and shook hands with them . She was sorry to be cut off from them again. And they look ed at her with a touch of regr et as they left. She said to hers elf: 'The re is someth ing rich and alive in these people. They want to be able to breat he the Great Breat h. They are like childr en, help less. And then they're like demons. But somewh ere, I belie ve, they want the breath of life and the com munion of the brav e, mor e than anyth ing.' She was surprise d at herself , sudd enly using this language .

Concre te, jarring, exasp eratin g real ity had melt ed awa y, and a soft world of potency stood in its place , the velvet y dark flux from the earth, the del icate yet supreme life- breath in the inne r air. Behi nd the fierc e sun the dark eye s of a deepe r sun were watch ing, and bet ween the blu ish ribs of the mountain s a powe rful heart was sec retly beatin g, the heart of the eart h. Her house was what she wante d; a low, L-shaped , tile d buil ding with roug h red floors and deep veranda, and the oth er two sides of the pati o comp leted by the thick , dark littl e mang o-fore st out side the low wall. The square of the patio , with in the preci ncts of the hous e and the mango- trees, was gay with oleand ers and hibi scus, and ther e was a basi n of water in the seedy grass. The flower -pots alon g the verand a were full of flo wering geran ium and fore ign flow ers. At the far end of the patio the chic kens were scratchi ng unde r the silent motio nlessn ess of ragge d bana na-tre es.

With the house went a Mexica n Juan a with two thick- haired daught ers and one son. This fam ily lived in a den at the back of the proj ecting bay of the dining -room. Ther e, hal f scre ened, was the well and the toi let, and a little kitche n and a slee ping- room where the family slept on mats on the floor. There the paltry chicken s padd led, and the banan a-tree s made a chi tter as the wind came. Kate had four bedrooms to choose from. She chose the one whose low, barre d wind ow ope ned on the rough, grass and cobble- stone stre et, closed her doo rs and windo ws, and went to sleep, saying to hers elf as she lay dow n: Now I am alone . And now I have only one thin g to do: not to get caug ht up into the wor ld's cog-whe els any more , and not to lose my hol d on the hid den greater thing. She was tired with a strange weari ness, feelin g she could make no furt her effort. She woke up at tea-time , but there was no tea. Juan a hast ened off to the hotel to buy a bit. Juan a was a woma n of about forty, rather short , with full dark face , cent reless dark eyes, untidy hair, and a limpi ng way of walk ing. She spoke rapidly, a rat her plum-in- the- mouth Spanish, addi ng 'n' to all her words. Some thing of a sloven, down to her spee ch. 'No, Ni a, no hay masn'--masn instead of mas. And calling Kate, in � the old Mexican style, Ni a, which means child. It is the � hono urable title for a mistr ess. Juan a was going to be a bit of a trial. She was a widow of doub tful anteced ents, a crea ture with passion, but not muc h cont rol, strong with a certa in ind iffere nce and loos eness.

She would be honest out of roug h defi ance and ind iffere nce, so long as she was not in a sta te of antagon ism. As yet, however, she was cau tiousl y watc hing her gro und, with that blac k-eyed touch of malice and war iness to be expect ed. And Kat e felt that the cry: Ni a--child! by which she was addressed, held � in it a slight note of malev olent mocker y. But there was nothing to do but to go ahead and trus t the dark- face d, cen treles s woma n. The second day, Kate had the energ y to cast out one suite of ben t- wood and cane furnitur e from her salon, remove pictu res and litt le stan ds. If there is one social insti nct more dre ary than all the other soci al ins tincts in the worl d, it is the Mexic an.

Even of these , ther e were few. Neve rthele ss, there were two hotel s, lef t over , real ly, from the safe quiet days of Don Porfi rio, as were most of the villa s.

Sayu la had her little branch of railway, her one tra in a day. The rail way did not pay, and fou ght with ext inctio n. But it was enou gh. Sayu la als o had that real insanity of America, the automob ile. As men used to want a hor se and a swo rd, now they want a car. As wome n used to pine for a hom e and a box at the theat re, now it is a 'mac hine.' And the poor fol low the midd le cla ss. There was a perp etual rush of 'mac hines' , moto r-cars and motor- buses- -called cami nes--along the one forlorn road coming to Sayula from � Guad alajar a. One hope , one faith, one destiny ; to ride in a cami n, to own a car. � Ther e was a litt le ban dit scare when Kat e arri ved in the village , but she did not pay much hee d.

The band played no mor e in Sayula, and the ele gancia strol led no more on the inne r pave ment around the plaza, under the tre es. But the paveme nt was still good, and the ben ches were still more-or- less sound . Oh Don Porfirio 's day ! And now it was the peons and Indi ans, in thei r blan kets and whi te clo thes, who filled the benc hes and mono polize d the square .

The very singing seeme d secr etive, the singers press ing close in, face to face, as if to keep the wild, melancho ly bal lad re-echoi ng in their private breas ts, their back to the world. And the whole village was in the plaza, it was like a camp , with the low, rapid sound of voic es. Rarely, very rarely , a voice rose abov e the deep murmur of the men, the musical ripple of the wome n, the twitte r of childre n.

They seeme d outs ide the nucl eus of life. Away on the nort h side , the booths were still flarin g, peo ple were buyi ng and selli ng. But thi s quar ter, too, looked lonely, and outs ide the actu al rea lity, almost like memory . When the men sat down, the women began to drif t up shyly, and seat them selves on the grou nd at the outer rim, the ir ful l cott on ski rts flow ering out around them, and the ir dar k rebo zos drawn tight over thei r smal l, rou nd, shy head s, as they squatte d on the gro und. Some , too shy to come right up, lingered on the near est benches of the plaza. And some had gon e away . Ind eed, a good many men and wome n had disapp eared as soo n as the dru m was heard.

But Kate, standi ng bac k in the doo rway, with Juana sitting on the door step at her feet, was fascinat ed by the silent, half- naked ring of men in the torchlig ht. Their heads were black, their bodies soft and ruddy with the pecu liar Indian beauty that has at the same time somet hing terribl e in it. The soft , full , hand some torsos of sile nt men with heads softly bent a litt le for ward; the soft, easy shou lders, that are yet so broad, and which balance upon so powe rful a backb one; shoulde rs dro oping a litt le, with the rela xation of slumberi ng, quiescen t powe r; the beaut iful ruddy skin , glea ming with a dark finenes s; the stron g brea sts, so male and so dee p, yet witho ut the muscu lar hardenin g that belon gs to whit e men; and the dar k, clo sed faces, closed upon a darke ned cons ciousn ess, the bla ck mou stache s and delica te bea rds framing the clos ed sil ence of the mouth; all this was stra ngely impres sive, movi ng str ange, fright ening emotio ns in the soul.

It was lik e a darkly glowing , vivi d nucl eus of new life. Repell ent the strang e heav iness, the sinking of the spir it int o the earth, like dark water.

Yet she prefe rred to be on the fringe , suff icient ly out of contact. She could not bear to come into actu al con tact. The man with the banne r of the sun lifte d his face as if he were goin g to speak. And yet he did not spea k.

'The man on the hill said: I am Quetzal coatl, who breathe d mois ture on your dry mouths. I filled your breasts with breath from beyon d the sun.

And the axis of our worldly space , when you enter, is a vastness where even the trees come and go, and the soul is at home in its own dream, noble and unquest ioned. The strang e, inw ard pulse of the drum, and the singe r sing ing inwa rdly, swirle d the soul back into the very centre of time, which is older than age.

And one by one, voices in the crow d brok e free , like birds laun ching and coming in from a dis tance, caugh t by the spe ll. The word s did not matter. Any verse, any words, no word s, the song rema ined the sam e: a strong, deep wind rushing from the caverns of the breast , from the everlas ting soul!

At night, the little road outsi de was quite dark, and the dro pping of the cuent as star tled the sil ence. The nights , whic h at first had see med perfectl y frie ndly, began to be full of terro rs. Fear had rise n agai n. A band of robb ers had gath ered in one of the outly ing villages on the lake , a village wher e the men had bad charac ters, as bei ng rea dy to turn bandit at any moment . And this gang, invisi ble in the daytime , cons isting duri ng the day of lake fishe rmen and lab ourers on the land , at night would set off on horsebac k to sack any lone ly, or insu fficie ntly- protect ed hou se.

She had been out in a boat on the lake, and had seen his � hous e, rou nd the bend of the weste rn poi nt. It was a redd ish- and- yell ow two -store y hous e with a lit tle stone basin for the boats, and a mang o grov e betw een it and the lak e. Among the tree s, awa y from the lake, were the blac k adob e huts , two rows, of the peons . The hacien da had once been a large one. But it had been irrigat ed from the hills, and the revo lution s had broken all the aqu educts . Only a small supply of water was available. Then Don Ram n had had � enem ies in the Governm ent. So tha t a good dea l of his lan d was take n away to be divid ed amo ng the peons . Now , he had onl y some thre e hund red acres. The two hund red acres along the lake -shore were mostl y lost to him. He worke d a few acre s of fruit land round the house, and in a tiny val ley just in the hills he raise d suga r- cane . On the patches of the mount ain slope little patches of maize were to be seen. But Do a Carlota had money. She was from Torreon and drew still a � good incom e from the mines. A mozo came with a note from Don Ram n: might he bring his wife to � call on Kate? Do a Carlota was a thin, gentle, wide-eyed woman, with a slightly � star tled express ion, and sof t, bro wnish hair. She was pur e Euro pean in extr action , of a Spani sh fat her and Fren ch mot her: very diff erent from the usu al sto ut, over-pow dered, ox- like Mex ican matr on. Her fac e was pale, faded, and without any make- up at all. Her thin, eager figure had somethi ng Eng lish about it, but her stra nge, wide brown eyes wer e not Englis h. She spok e only Spani sh-- or French. But her Spanish was so slow and distinct and slightl y plai ntive, that Kate underst ood her at once. The two women understo od one anoth er qui ckly, but were a little nervous of one another. Do a Carlota was delicate and sensitive �"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"like a Chi huahua dog, and with the same slight ly pro minent eyes. Kate felt she had rare ly met a wom an wit h such a dog -like finess e of gentleness. And the two women talked. Ram n, large and muted, � kept himse lf in reserv e. It was as if the two women rushe d toge ther to unit e agai nst his sile nce and his powerf ul, differen t sign ifican ce. Kate knew at once that Do a Carlota loved him, but with a love that � was now nearly all WIL L. She had worshi pped him, and she had had to leave off wor shippi ng him . She had had to questi on him . And she would never now cease from que stioni ng. So he sat apart, a lit tle constrai ned, his han dsome head hanging a litt le, and his dark, sensit ive hands dangling betwe en his thigh s. 'I had suc h a wonderfu l time !' Kat e said sudde nly to him. 'I danc ed a dance round the dru m with the Men of Quetza lcoatl .' 'I heard,' he said, with a rather stiff smile. Do a Carlota understood English, though she would not speak it. � 'You dance d with the men of Quetza lcoatl !' she said in Spa nish, in a pained voice. 'But, Se ora, why did you do such a thing? Oh � why? ' 'I was fas cinate d,' said Kat e. 'No, you must not be fascina ted. No! No! It is not good . I tell you. I am so SORRY my husba nd int erests himse lf in this thing. I am so sorr y.' Juan a was bringi ng a bottle of ver mouth: all that Kate had to offer her visito rs, in the morning . 'You went to see your boys in the United States?' said Kate to Do a � Carl ota. 'How were they?' 'Oh, bette r, tha nk you . The y are well; that is, the young er is very delic ate.' 'You didn' t brin g him home?' 'No! No! I thi nk the y are better at school. Here- -here- -there are so man y thin gs to troubl e them . No! But they will come hom e next month , for the vacation .' 'How nice! ' said Kate. 'The n I shall see them . The y will be here, won' t they ?--on the lake?' 'Wel l!-- I am not sure. Perh aps for a little while. You see I am so busy in Mexic o with my Cuna.' 'Wha t is a Cuna? ' said Kate; she only knew it was the Span ish for crad le. It turned out to be a foundl ings' home, run by a few obscu re Carmelite sisters. And Do a Carlota was the director. Kate �"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"gathered that Don Ram n's wife was an intense, almost exalted � Cath olic. She exalted herse lf in the Church, and in her work for the Cuna. 'There are so many children born in Mexico,' said Do a Carlota, � 'and so many die . If only we coul d save them, and equip them for life . We do a little, all we can. ' It seemed the waste, unwante d babi es cou ld be delive red in at the door of the Cuna , like parce ls. The mot her had only to knock, and hand in the litt le liv ing bundle. 'It saves so man y moth ers from neg lectin g thei r babi es, and lett ing them die,' said Do a Carlota. 'Then we do what we can. If the � moth er doe sn't leave a name, I nam e the child. Very often I do. The mother s just hand over a littl e nake d thin g, som etimes witho ut a name or a rag to cov er it. And we nev er ask .' The childr en wer e not all kept in the Home. Only a small number . Of the oth ers, some decent Indian woman was paid a small sum to take the child into her home . Eve ry mon th she must come with the litt le one to the Cuna , to receive her wage. The Indians are so very rarel y unki nd to childr en. Careles s, yes . But rarel y, rar ely unki nd. In former days, Do a Carlota said, nearly every well-born lady in � Mexi co wou ld rec eive one or more of thes e foun dlings into her home, and have it brou ght up with the family. It was the loose, patr iarcha l gene rosity innat e in the bos oms of the Spanish - Mexi cans. But now, few chil dren were adopted. Inst ead, they were taug ht as far as possi ble to be carpente rs or garden ers, or hous e- serv ants, or, among the girl s, dre ssmake rs, even sch ool- teachers . Kate liste ned with une asy interest . She felt there was so much real human feeli ng in this Mexican chari ty: she was almost rebuk ed. Perhaps what Do a Carlota was doing was the best that could be � done , in this half-wil d, hel pless countr y. At the same time, it was such a forlo rn hop e, it made one's heart sink. And Do a Carlota, confident as she was in her good works, still had � just a bit the look of a vic tim; a gentl e, sen sitive , slig htly star tled victim. As if some secre t enem y drai ned her bloo d. Don Ram n sat there impassive, listening without heeding; solid and � unmo ving AGAINST the charita ble quiver of his wife's emoti on. He let her do as she woul d. But agai nst her work and against her flow he was in silent , heav y, unc hangin g oppo sition . She knew this, and trem bled in her nervou s eage rness, as she talk ed to Kate about the Cuna , and won Kate's sympath y. Till it seemed to her that there was something cruel in Don Ram n's passive, masked poise. An � impa ssive male cruelty , chan geless as a stone idol. 'Now won't you come and spen d the day with me while I am here with Don Ram n?' said Do a Carlota. 'The house is very poor and rough. � � It is no longer what it used to be. But it is your house if you will come. ' Kate accep ted, and sai d she would prefer to walk out .

'Whe re is Genera l Vied ma?' asked Kate. 'We shall try to get him out when you come,' replied Do a Carlota. � 'I am so very fond of Don Cipriano , I have kno wn him for many year s, and he is the godfath er of my you nger son. But now he is in comm and of the Guadala jara divisio n, he is not very often able to come out.' 'I wonder why he is a Genera l?' said Kat e. 'He seem s to me too huma n.' 'Oh, but he is very human too. But he is a general; yes, yes, he want s to be in command of the sold iers. And I tell you, he is very stro ng. He has great power with his reg iments . The y beli eve in him, oh, they believe in him . He has that pow er, you know , that some of the high er typ es of Indian s have , to make many oth ers want to follow them and fig ht for them. You know? Don Ciprian o is like that . You can never change him. But I think a woma n migh t be wond erful for him. He has lived so with out any woma n in his lif e. He won't care about them.' 'Wha t does he care abo ut?' asked Kate. 'Ah!' Do a Carlota started as if stung. Then she glanced quickly, � invo luntar ily at her husband , as she add ed: 'I don' t know . Real ly, I don't know.' 'The Men of Quetzalcoatl,' said Don Ram n heavily, with a little � smil e. But Do a Carlota seemed to be able to take all the ease and the � bant er out of him. He seeme d stif f and a bit stupid . 'Ah, there ! The re! There you hav e it! The Men of Quetza lcoatl -- that is a nice thing for him to care abo ut! A nice thing, I say ,' fluttered Do a Carlota, in her gentle, fragile, scolding way. And � it was evi dent to Kate that she adored both the men, and tremble d in opposit ion to their wrong ness, and would never give in to the m. To Ram n it was a terrible burden, his wife's quivering, absolute, � blin d oppo sition , take n in conjunc tion with her help less adorati on. A man-serv ant appeared at nine o'c lock one mor ning, to acc ompany Kate to the haci enda, which was called Jamilte pec. He had a bask et, and had been shoppin g in the mar ket. An eld erly man, with grey in his mous tache, he had brig ht you ng eye s and seemed full of ener gy. His bar e feet in the huar aches were almost black with expo sure, but his clot hes were bri lliant ly whi te. Kate was glad to be walking. The one depressi ng thi ng abo ut lif e in the vil lages was that one could not walk out into the country . Ther e was always the liabili ty to be hel d up or atta cked.

Now she was beginnin g to feel a prison er. She was glad, then, to be setting off. The morning was clear and hot, the pale brown lake qui te sti ll, like a phantom . Peo ple were movi ng on the beach, in the distan ce tin y, lik e dots of white: whit e dots of men foll owing the faint dust of donkey s. She wond ered often why hum anity was like spe cks in the Mexican land scape; just specks of life. They passe d from the lake shore to the rough, dusty road going west , betw een the stee p slop e of the hil ls and the bit of flat by the lake. For almost a mile there were villas , most of them shu t up fast, some of them smashe d, wit h brok en wal ls and smash ed wind ows. Only flowers bloom ed in masses above the rubble. In the emp ty pla ces were fli msy straw huts of the natives, haph azard, as if blown there . By the road und er the hill were blac k-grey adobe huts, like boxes, and fowls running about , and brow n pigs or grey pig s spot ted with bla ck car eered and grunted, and half- naked childre n, dar k oran ge-bro wn, trotted or lay flat on thei r face s in the roa d, the ir lit tle naked posterio rs hun ched up, fast aslee p.

They wer e pret ending to hurry, too, beca use the real rains might begin any day. And in the little ston y leve ls by the lake, the land was being scratch -ploug hed by a pair of oxen and a lum p of pointed wood. But this part of the road Kate kne w. She knew the fine villa on the knoll, with its tufts of palms , and the laid-out avenu es tha t were laid out, indeed, as the dead are, to cru mble back again. She was glad to be past the vill as, where the road came down to the lake again , unde r big shady trees that had twi sted, wriggl y bean s. On the lef t was the water, the col our of turtl edoves , lapp ing the pale fawn stones . At a wate r-hole of a stream in the beac h, a clus ter of women were busily washi ng clo thes. In the shal lows of the lake itself two women sat bath ing, their black hair hanging dens e and wet. A litt le far ther along a man was wad ing slowly, stop ping to thro w his round net skilfull y upon the water, then slow ly sto oping and gatherin g it in, pic king out the tiny, glitt ery fish calle d char ales.

A bluff of yello w rock came juttin g at the roa d. The road wound roun d it, and into a piece of flat open countr y. There were fie lds of dry sto ne, and hedg es of dusty thorn and cactus. To the left the bright green of the will ows by the lake- shore. To the right the hills swerve d inla nd, to meet the sheer, fluted sides of dry moun tains.

And where the hil ls app roache d the lake again ther e was a dark clust ering of man go-tre es, and the red upper stor ey of the hacienda house . 'There it is!' cried the man behind. 'Jamiltepec, Se orita. 'La � hacienda de Don Ram n!' � And his eyes sho ne as he sai d the name. He was a proud peon, and he really seemed happy . 'Loo k! How far! ' crie d Juan a.

It was har d to come back to these things . The noise of them soun ded on the outside of his ears , but inside them was the slow , vast , inau dible roar of the cosmos , like in a sea- shell. It was hard to have to bear the con tact of comm onplac e dail y thin gs, when his soul and bod y were naked to the cosm os. He wished they would leave him the veils of his isol ation awhile . But they would not: especial ly Car lota. She wanted him to be pres ent to her: in fam iliar contac t. She was calling: 'Ram n! Ram n! Have you finished? Cipriano is � � here .' And even so, in her voice was fear, and an overrid ing teme rity. He pushed back his hai r and rose, and very qui ckly went out, as he was, with naked torso. He didn't want to dres s hims elf into ever yday familia rity, since his soul was unfam iliar. They had a tea- table out on the terrace, and Ciprian o, in unifor m, was there. He got up quickl y, and came down the ter race with outs tretch ed arm s, his black eyes gleami ng wit h an intensi ty alm ost like pain, upon the face of the other man.

The two men embr aced, breast to breast, and for a moment Ciprian o laid his little blacki sh han ds on the naked shoulder s of the big ger man, and for a moment was perfectl y stil l on his bre ast. Then very soft ly, he stood back and looked at him, sayin g not a word . Ram n abstractedly laid his hand on Cipriano's shoulder, looking � down at him with a lit tle smile. 'Qu tal?'' he said, from the edge of his lips. 'How goes it?' � ''Bi en! Muy bie n!' said Cip riano, still gazin g into the other man' s face with black, wonde ring, childl ike, searchi ng eye s, as if he, Cipriano, were searching for HIMSELF, in Ram n's face. Ram n � � look ed bac k into Cipri ano's black, India n eyes with a fain t, kin d smil e of recogni tion, and Cipriano hung his head as if to hide his face , the black hair, which he wor e rath er lon g and brushe d side ways, droppi ng ove r his forehe ad. The women watche d in absolut e sile nce. Then, as the two men beg an slow ly to come along the ter race to the tea- table, Carlota began to pour tea. But her han d trem bled so much , the teapot wobbl ed as she held it, and she had to put it dow n and clasp her hands in the lap of her whi te mus lin dress.

Kate saw the sig h lift the soft, quiesce nt, cream- brown shoulder s. The soft, cream- brown skin of his back, of a smooth PURE sens uality , made her shudder . The broad , squa re, rather high shou lders, with neck and hea d risi ng ste ep, proudly. The full- fles hed, deep- chested, rich body of the man made her feel dizzy. In spite of hers elf, she cou ld not help imagin ing a knife stuck betw een those pure, male sho ulders . If only to brea k the arroga nce of their remoten ess. That was it. His nake dness was so aloof , far- off and inta ngible , in another day. So that to THINK of it was almost a viola tion, even to look at it wit h pryi ng eye s.

Better to lap se awa y from one's own prying , asse rtive self, into the sof t, unt respas sing self, to whom naked ness is neit her shame nor exci tement , but clothe d like a flow er in its own deep , soft consc iousne ss, beyond cheap awarene ss. The evenin g bree ze was blowi ng ver y fain tly. Sailin g-boat s were adva ncing throug h the pearly atmos phere, far off, the sun above had a golden quality . The oppos ite shore, twenty miles away, was dist inct, and yet ther e seem ed an opales cent, spume- like haze in the air, the sam e qual ity as in the film y wate r. Kate cou ld see the white specks of the far- off church towers of Tul iapan. Belo w, in the garden below the hou se, was a thick grove of mango - tree s. Among the dark and reddish leave s of the man gos, scarlet litt le bir ds wer e bust ling, like suddenl y-open ing poppy- buds, and pair s of yellow birds, yello w unde rneath as yellow butterf lies, so perf ectly clear, went skimmi ng pas t.

So the glo zing blac k eyes of the chil d woul d twit ch, and Mari a woul d brea k into mean ingles s tear s, Con cha into a loud, brutal, mocki ng lau gh, like some viole nt bir d. And Juan a inte rrupte d her black and gluey flow of words to glan ce at her daughter s and throw out some ine ffectu al rema rk. The victim , the inevit able victim, and the ine vitabl e vict imizer . The terrib le, terrible hot emptine ss of the Mexican mornin gs, the weig ht of black ennui that hung in the air! It made Kate feel as if the bot tom had fall en out of her soul . She went out to the lake , to escape that house, that family. Sinc e the rains, the trees in the broken garde ns of the lake fro nt had flamed into scarle t, and poure d them selves out into lavender flow ers. Rose red, scarlet and lavender , quic k, tro pical flower s. Wond erful splash es of colour . But that was all: spl ashes! They made a spl ash, like firework s. And Kate thought of the blac kthorn puffi ng whi te, in the early year , in Ireland , and hawtho rn wit h cora l grai ns, in a dam p stil l morn ing in the lanes, and foxglove s by the bar e rock , and tufts of ling and heather , and a rave l of harebel ls. And a terribl e, terr ible longing for home came ove r her. To escape from these trop ical brillia ncies and meaningl essnes ses. In Mexico, the wind was a hard dra ught, the rain was a slu ice of wate r, to be avo ided, and the sun hit down on one with hos tility , terr ific and stu nning.

The smell of Mexi co, however subtle , sugg ested violen ce and thing s in chemica l conf lict. And Kate felt herself filled with an ang er of resent ment.

The lake was so still and fil my as to be almost invis ible. In the near dist ance, some dark women were kne eling on the edge of the lake, dres sed only in their long wet che mises in whi ch the y had bathed . Some were washin g garm ents, some were pouring water over them selves , scoo ping it up in gour d scoo ps and pouri ng it over thei r blac k head s and ruddy- dark shoulde rs, in the intense press ure of the sun shine. On her lef t were two big tre es, and a cane fen ce, and little straw huts of Ind ians. There the beach itself ended, and the little Indian plots of lan d went down to the lake- front.

Dang ling from his tiny outst retche d arm, held by the webbe d toe, head down and feebly flappin g its out- sinking wings, was a bird, a wate r-fowl .

And half- seen people went swiftly down to Juan a's end of the pat io, secretly . On such a night Kate sat on her veranda facing the deepnes s of the blac k nigh t. A candle shone in her dese rt sal on.

Her mot her, her fat her, her sis ters, her first husb and, even her chil dren whom she love d, and Joach im, for whom she had felt suc h pass ionate love, even these, being near her, fill ed her with a cert ain disgust and repulsio n afte r a little whil e, and she longed to fli ng the m down the great and fin al oubl iette. But there is no great and final oubliett e: or at lea st, it is never fina l, unt il one has flung ONESELF down. So it was with Kate. Till she flu ng her self down the last dark oubl iette of dea th, she woul d neve r esca pe fro m her deep, her bott omless disgu st wit h huma n bein gs. Brief contact s were all righ t, thr illing even. But close contac ts, or long contac ts, were shor t and long revulsi ons of viole nt dis gust. She and Ram n had sat down on a bench under the white-flowering � olea nder of the garden downs tairs. His face was imp assive and stil l. In the stillne ss, with a certain pain and nausea, he real ized the sta te she was in, and reali zed that his own state, as rega rds PERSONAL peopl e, was the same. Mere PERSONA L cont act, mere huma n cont act filled him, too, wit h disg ust. Carlot a disg usted him. Kate herse lf dis gusted him. Somet imes, Cipria no dis gusted him. But this was bec ause, or whe n, he met them on a mere ly hum an, pers onal plane. To do so was disa ster: it fil led him with disgu st of them and loat hing of hims elf. He had to meet them on anoth er pla ne, where the cont act was diff erent; intan gible, remot e, and witho ut INT IMACY. His soul was conc erned elsewh ere. So tha t the quick of him need not be bound to anyb ody. The quick of a man must turn to God alone: in some way or othe r. With Cipri ano he was most sure. Ciprian o and he, even whe n they embr aced each other with pas sion, when they met afte r an absence , embr aced in the recogn ition of eac h othe r's eternal and abiding lone liness ; like the Morning Star.

Ram n knew what it was to gnash at his leashes. He had gnashed � hims elf almost to piec es, before he had found the way to pass out in himself , in the qui ck of himsel f, to the Quick of all being and exis tence, which he called the Mor ning Star, since men mus t give all things names . To pass in the quick of him self, with tran sfigur ation, to the Morn ing Star, and ther e, the re alo ne mee t his fellow man. He knew what it was to fail even now, and to keep on faili ng. With Carl ota he faile d abso lutely . She claim ed him and he rest rained hims elf in resis tance. Even his very naked breast, when Carlota was there, was self- consciou s and assert ively naked. But then that was becaus e she claime d it as her proper ty. When men meet at the quick of all things , they are neither naked nor clothe d; in the transfig uratio n they are just complete , they are not seen in part. The final perfect stren gth has also the powe r of innocen ce. Sitting on the seat beside Kate, Ram n was sad with the sense of � heav iness and inadequa cy. His thi rd Hym n was angry and bitter. Carl ota almost embitte red his soul . In Mexico , turb ulent fellow s had caught at his idea and burlesq ued it. The y had invade d one of the church es of the city, thrown out the sacre d imag es, and hung in their place the grotesque papier-m ch Judas figures, which the � � Mexi cans explode at Easter time.

Though it was not far to Jamilte pec, once outside the vill age, the cha uffeur and his lit tle attendan t lad began to get frig htened , and to go frog- like with fea r. Ther e is somethi ng tru ly mys teriou s abou t the Mexica n qual ity of fear . As if man and woman collaps ed and lay wriggli ng on the grou nd lik e brok en rep tiles, unabl e to rise. Kate used all her will , agai nst this cri nging nonsen se. They arriv ed wit hout ado at Jamilt epec. The place seemed quiet, but normal . An oxen wagon stood empty in the courty ard. There were no soldiers on guard. They had all been withdr awn, against the rebell ion. But several peons were moving round, in a desult ory fash ion. The day was a fies ta, when not much work was doi ng. In the houses of the peon s, the women were pattin g tort illas, and prep aring hot chile sauce, grindin g away on the meta tes. A fies ta! Only the windmil l that pumpe d up water from the lake was spinnin g quic kly, with a little noise . Kate drove into the yard in silenc e, and two mozos with guns and belt s of cartrid ges came to talk in low tones to the chauf feur. 'Is Do a Carlota here?' asked Kate. � 'No, Se ora. The patrona is not here.' � 'Don Ram n?' � 'S , Se ora!

'I don' t know if you'd rather I hadn 't. But I can go back in the motor- car.' 'No, ' he said. 'I am glad. I was feeli ng des erted, I don 't kno w why. Let us go upstai rs.' 'Patr n!' said the chauffeur, in a low voice. 'Must I stay?' � Ram n said a few words to him. The chauffeur was uneasy, and � didn 't wan t to stay. He sai d he had to be bac k in Sayula at suc h and such a time. Excu ses, anyhow. But it was evide nt he wanted to get away. 'Then best let him go,' said Ram n to Kate. 'You do not mind going � home in the boat ?' 'I don't want to give you trouble. ' 'It is lea st tro uble to let this fellow go, and you can leave by boat just whenev er you wish to. So we shall all be more free.' Kate paid the chauffeu r, and the Ford started rattli ng. After ratt ling a while , it moved in a curve round the cour tyard, and lurched through the zagu n, disappearing as fast as possible. � Ram n spoke to his two mozos with the guns. They went to the outer � door way, obedien tly. 'Why do you have to have arm ed men ?' she said. 'Oh, they' re afr aid of bandi ts,' he said . 'Wh enever there 's a rebe llion anywhe re, everybod y is afraid of ban dits. So of cours e that calls bandi ts int o life .' 'But where do they com e from ?' sai d Kate , as they passed into the inne r door ways. 'Fro m the villag es,' he said , clos ing the heav y door of that entr ance behind him, and put ting the hea vy iro n bars acros s, fro m wall to wall. The inner archwa y was now a little priso n, for the strong iron gate s at the lak e end of the passa ge wer e shut fast. She looked thro ugh, at the little round pond. It had som e blue water -lilie s on it. Beyond, the pallid lake seemed almost like a ghost , in the glar e of the sun . A servant was sent to the kitchen quarters, Ram n and Kate climbed � the stone stairs to the uppe r terr ace. How lonely, stonil y lone some and for lorn the hac ienda could feel! The very stone walls coul d give off emptine ss, loneline ss, negation . 'But which villa ges do the bandits come from?' she insiste d. 'Any of them.

'It is har d to believe !' she said. 'It is so obviou s!' he said, dropp ing into one of the rock ing- chai rs opp osite her, and smi ling across the onyx tab le. 'I suppose it is!' she said. He clapped his hands, and his mozo Martin came up. Ram n ordered � some thing, in a low, subdued tone. The man replied in an even lowe r, mor e subd ued tone. Then the mast er and man nodded at one anot her, and the man departe d, his huara ches swishin g a little on the terrac e.

This was unus ual, and Kat e noti ced it in him with displ easure .

She ran strai ght out into the light, toward s the parape t wall , and had nearly come in sight of the gate way of the courty ard below, when somethin g gave a sli ght smack, and bit s of plaster flew in her face and her hair . She turne d and fled back like a bee to the stai rway. The stairs came up in a corn er, where there was a little sort of ston e turr et, square, with stone seats.

She sighed , wond ering what it all was. It was death , she knew. But so str ange, so vac ant. Just these noises of sho ts! And she coul d see nothin g outs ide. She wanted to see what was in the cour tyard. Ram n was at his post, pressing himself close to the wall, looking � down , with bent head, motion less.

The new bride was a young � woma n of about twenty- eight, calle d Tere sa. There was a very quiet civil wedding, and Ram n brought his new wife to Jamiltepec. � He had kno wn her since she was a child, for she was the daughter of the famous hacie nda of Las Yemas, some twelve miles inland from Jamiltepec. Don Tom s, her father, had been a staunch friend of � the Carras cos. But Don Tom s had died a year ago, leaving the large, flourishing � tequ ila hacienda to his thre e chil dren, to be admini stered by Tere sa. Teresa was the youn gest. Her two bro thers had reverted to the usual wastef ul, spendthr ift, brutal Mexica n way. Ther efore Don Tom s, in order to save the hacienda from their destructive hands, � had especi ally appoint ed Ter esa administ rador, and had got the brot hers' consen t to this. After all, they were shi ftless ne'er - do-wells, and had neve r show n the slight est desire to help in the rath er bur densom e busi ness of mana ging a large tequi la hac ienda, duri ng the ir fat her's lifeti me. Teresa had been the one. And duri ng her fathe r's illness the whole charge had dev olved on her , whil e her brothe rs was ted themselv es and their subst ance in the squa shy prostitu tion- living of Mex icans of the ir cla ss, away in the citi es. No sooner was the fath er dea d, how ever, and Teresa in char ge, than home came the two brot hers, big with the ir int ention to be hace ndados . By simple brute force they ousted their siste r, gav e orde rs ove r her head, jeered at her, and in crushing her united for once with each other. They were putting her back into her place as a woman- -that is to say, bac k into a sec luded sort of pros tituti on, to which, in the ir eye s, wom en bel onged. But they were bullies, and, as bul lies, coward s. And like so many Mexi cans of that class , soft and suicida l towa rds themselv es. They made frien ds wit h judg es and gener als.

'Mak e your self desirab le, and get a husb and for your self,' they said to her. In their eyes, her gre atest crime was that she did not mak e hers elf desi rable to men of their sort.

She went to her lawyer s, but they held up thei r hand s. And she went to Ram n, whom she had known since she was a child. � It would have meant a hopele ss and ruino us law -suit, to get the brot hers ejected from the hacienda . It would have meant the rap id ruin of the estate. Ram n instead asked Teresa to marry him, and � he careful ly arr anged her dowry, so that she should always have her own provis ion. 'It is a country where men despise sex, and live for it,' said Ram n. 'Which is just suicide.' � Ram n came with his wife, to see Kate. Teresa was rather small, � pale , with a lot of loose black hair and big, wide black eyes. Yet in her qui et bea ring and her well- closed mouth there was an air of inde penden ce and autho rity. She had suf fered great humili ation at the hands of her broth ers, there was sti ll a certain wanne ss rou nd her eyes, the remains of tea rs of anger and helpless indig nation , and the bitterness of insulted sex. But now she loved Ram n with a � wild , virg in loy alty. That, too, was evident. He had sav ed her sex from the ins ult, restore d it to her in its pride and its beau ty. And in return , she felt an almo st fie rce reverenc e for him. But with Kate she was shy and rath er dis tant: a litt le afr aid of the travel led, experie nced, rather asser tive white- skinned woman , the woman of the other race. She sat in Kate' s salo n in her sim ple whit e dres s with a bla ck gau ze reb ozo, her bro wn han ds mot ionles s in her lap , her dark neck erect, her dar k, sle nder, well- shaped chee k aver ted.

She did not even look at Ram n. � 'How much do you charg e per word, Chica? ' he asked her, with a sort of soft fondness . Then her dark eyes fla shed at him, and her mou th gav e a little smil e. It was evident she was hop elessl y in love with him , in a sort of trance or muse of love. And she maint ained such a cold sort of blanknes s towa rds Kate.

And at the same time, she watc hed Kate, the pote ntial enemy, the woman who tal ked with men on thei r own plane. Kate rose to get spoon s. At the same moment, he ste pped back from the low table where he was squeezi ng a lime, so that he came int o slig ht col lision with her. And Kate not iced again how qui ck and subt le was his physica l evas ion of her, the soft, almost liquid, hot quickn ess of slidi ng out of contact with her. His nat ural volu ptuous ness avoided her as a flame leans away fro m a draught. She flushe d slig htly. And Teresa saw the quic k flus h unde r the fair , warm -white skin, the leap of yello w ligh t, alm ost like ang er, into Kate' s grey -hazel eyes.

And Teresa rose and went to Ram n's side, bending over and looking � in the tum blers, askin g, wit h that curio us aff ected childi shness of dark women : 'Wha t do you put in?' 'Look!' said Ram n. And with the same curious male childishness of � dark men, he was expla ining the cocktail to her, giv ing her a litt le gin in a spoon, to taste. 'It is an impure tequila,' she said na vely. � 'At eight pesos a bott le?' he laug hed. 'So much! It is much!

Yet Kate herself had convinc ed her self of one thing, final ly: that the clue to all living and to all moving -on into new livin g lay in the vivid blood- relati on bet ween man and woman .

'And we will write the Song of Malintzi,' said Ram n. � 'Don 't do that!' cried Kate quickl y. He looked at her , in his slo w, won dering way. He could make her feel , at moments , as if she were a sort of chi ld and as if he were a ghost. Kate went to Jam iltepe c, and befor e the two women knew it, almos t, they were making dress es for Teres a, cut ting up the pineap ple- colo ured muslin. Poor Teres a, for a bri de she had a scant y ward robe: nothin g but her rather patheti c blac k dres ses that some how made her look poor, and a few old whit e dres ses. She had live d for her father- -who had a good lib rary of Mexi cana and was all his life wri ting a histo ry of the State of Jalis co-- and for the haci enda. And it was her proud boast that Las Yemas was the onl y haci enda, within a hun dred miles range, which had not been smash ed at all dur ing the revo lution s that follo wed the flig ht of Porfir io Diaz . Tere sa had a goo d deal of the nun in her . But that was because she was deeply passi onate, and deep passion tends to hid e with in itse lf, rather than expose itself to vul gar contact. So Kate pinned the mus lin over the brown shoul ders, wonder ing again at the str ange, uncann y soft ness of the dark skin, the hea viness of the black hair. Teres a's family, the Romeros, had been in Mexic o sinc e the early days of the Conque st. Tere sa wan ted long sle eves.

And Kate did so, reali zing it beca me the other woman 's nat ure bett er. 'The men here don't like lit tle thin wom en,' said Teresa, wist fully. 'One doesn 't car e what THE MEN lik e,' said Kat e.

Ram n was a good deal absent, either in Mexico City or in � Guad alajar a, or even away in Sonor a. He was already famou s and noto rious throug hout the cou ntry, his name was a nam e to conjure with . But under neath the rather ready hero- worship of the Mexi cans, Kate somehow felt their latent grudg ing.

And to Kat e, sce ptic as she was, it seem ed muc h more likel y that they were sharpening the machete to stick in Ram n's heart, when he � got a bit too big for them, than anythin g else . Tho ugh, to be sure , ther e was Cipria no to reckon with. And Cipria no was a lit tle devi l whom they quite rightl y fear ed. And Cip riano, for once, was fait hful. He was, to himsel f, Hui tzilop ochtli , and to thi s he would maintain a demonish faith. He was Huitzilopochtli, Ram n was � Quet zalcoa tl. To Cipr iano this was a plain and livi ng fac t. And he kept his army keen as a knife. Even the Presiden t woul d not care to run coun ter to Cipri ano. And the Pres ident was a brave man too. 'One day,' he said, 'we will put Quetzal coatl in Pue bla Cathedra l, and Huitzi lopoch tli in Mexic o Cath edral and Malintzi in Guadalup e. The day will come, Ram n.' � 'We will see that it comes,' Ram n replied. � But Ram n and Montes suffered alike from the deep, devilish � anim osity the country sent out in silenc e agai nst them.

The two women had � this in common, that they felt it was better to stan d fait hfully behi nd a really brave man, than to push forwar d into the ranks of chea p and obtrus ive women. And this uni ted them. A certa in dee p, ulti mate faithfu lness in eac h woma n, to her own man who needed her fide lity, kept Kate and Tere sa kin dred to one anothe r.

The lake was ver y full , stra nge and unea sy, and it had was hed up a bank of the wick ed wat er-hya cinths along all its sho res. The wild- fowl were coming from the north, clouds of wil d duck s like dust in the high air, sprinkli ng the water like weeds. Many , many wild fowl , greb e, cra nes, and whi te gul ls of the inland seas, so that the northe rn mys tery seemed to hav e blow n so far sou th. There was a smell of water in the land , and a sens e of soothin g. For Kate firm ly bel ieved that part of the horror of the Mexic an peo ple came from the unsooth ed dry ness of the land and the untem pered crudit y of the fla t-edge d suns hine. If only the re cou ld be a soft ening of wate r in the air , and a haze above trees , the unspok en and unsp eakabl e male volenc e woul d die out of the human hearts.

Ram n arrived home one evening in November, from a long journey to � Sono ra. He had come overlan d from Tepic , and twice had been stop ped by flood s. The rain s, so late, were very unusual.

And with tha t stra nge arch aic fulness of phy sique, with the full che st and the full, yet beau tiful buttoc ks of men on old Greek coins. He dropped off the edg e of masonry and waded out in the dim, sof t, unca nny water. And at that moment the light tipped over the edg e of the mou ntain and spilled gold upon the surf ace of the lake. And inst antly he was red as fire . The sunsh ine was not red, the sun was too high for that. It was gol den with mor ning. But as it flus hed along the surf ace of the lake it caugh t the body of Cipr iano and he was red as fire, as a piece of pure fire. The Sons of the Mornin g! The colu mn of blood! A Red Indi an. She look ed at him in wonde r, as he mov ed pur e red and luminous furth er into the lake, unconsc ious. As if on fire! The Sons of the Mornin g! She let her effort at know ing slip awa y from her once more, and rema ined without effor t, wit hin the comm union. It was his race, too.

He was gon e, and for a while she felt the old nostal gia for his pres ence. Not for him , exac tly. Not even to see him or touch him or speak to him. Only to feel him about . Then quick ly she recov ered. She adjuste d hers elf to the presenc e he left behind with her. As soon as he had REALLY gone, and the act of goi ng was over, his presenc e came back to her . She walked a lit tle while by the shore, beyond the breakwa ter wall. She loved to be alone: a gre at dea l alon e, wit h a garden and the lake and the mor ning. 'I am like Teres a, rea lly,' she said to hersel f. Sudd enly before her she saw a long , dark soft rope, lying over a pale bould er. But her soul was softly alert, at onc e. It was a snak e, wit h a subtle pattern along its soft dark bac k, lyi ng the re over a big stone , with its head sunk dow n to earth. It felt her pres ence, too, for sud denly, with incred ible soft quic kness, it contract ed its elf down the bould er, and she saw it ente ring a littl e gap in the botto m of the wal l. The hole was not very big. And as it entered it qui ckly looked back , pois ing its litt le, dark, wicked, pointe d head , and flic kering a dar k tong ue. Then it passe d on, slowly easin g its dark lengt h into the hole. When it had all gone in, Kat e coul d see the last fol d stil l, and the flat little head resting on the fold , like the devil with his chin on his arms , look ing out of a loop- hole. So the wick ed spa rks of the eye s look ed out at her, fro m with in the reces s. Watching out of its own invisib ility. So she won dered over it, as it lay in its hidd en pla ces. At all the unseen thing s in the hid den places of the earth. And she wond ered if it was dis appoin ted at not being able to rise higher in crea tion: to be able to run on fou r feet , and not keep its belly on the ground . Perh aps not!

This again gave her a feelin g of helples sness, a wom an's utter help lessne ss wit h a man who goes out to the beyond.

'Adi s!' said Kate to him, lingeringly. � 'Adi s, Patrona!' he replied, suddenly lifting his hand high, in � the Quetza lcoatl salut e. She walked acros s the beach to the jetty , feel ing the life surgi ng vivi d and resist ant within her. 'It is sex,' she said to hersel f. 'How wonde rful sex can be, when men keep it powerful and sacred, and it fil ls the world ! Lik e suns hine through and through one!- - But I'm not goin g to submit, even there. Why should one give in, to anythin g!' Ram n was coming down towards the boat, the blue symbol of � Quet zalcoa tl in his hat. And at that moment the dru ms beg an to soun d for mid- day, and there came the mid-day call, clear and dist inct, from the tow er. All the men on the shore stood erect, and shot up thei r righ t hand s to the sky . The women sprea d both palm s to the lig ht. Everyth ing was moti onless , save the moving anim als. Then Ram n went on to the boat, the men saluting him with the � Quet zalcoa tl sal ute as he came nea r. 'It is won derful , real ly,' said Kate, as they rowed over the wat er,"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"'how --how splend id one can feel in this countr y!

The natives still worsh ip it. ' 'At moments,' said Ram n. 'Later, they will murder you and violate � you, for having worshi pped you.' 'Is it ine vitabl e?' she said flipp antly. 'I think so,' he repli ed. 'If you lived here alone in Say ula, and quee ned it for a time, you would get you rself murder ed-- or worse -- by the peo ple who had worshi pped you.' 'I don't think so,' she said . 'I know,' he rep lied. 'Why ?' she said, obsti nate. 'Unl ess one gets one's nobil ity from the gods and turns to the midd le of the sky for one's power, one will be murde red at last. ' 'I do get my nob ility that way,' she sai d. But she did not quite believ e it. And she mad e up her min d stil l more defin itely, to go away. She wrote to Mex ico City, and enga ged a berth from Vera Cruz to Sout hampto n: she would sail on the last day of Novem ber. Cipria no came home on the seven teenth , and she told him what she had done . He looked at her with his head a little on one side, with a quee r boyi sh jud icious ness, but she coul d not tell at all what he felt . 'You are going already ?' he said in Span ish. And then she kne w, at last, that he was offend ed. When he was offe nded he neve r spok e Engl ish at all, but spoke Spanish just as if he were addre ssing anothe r Mexi can. 'Yes ,' she said. 'On the thirtiet h.' 'And when do you come back?' he asked. 'Qui n sabe!--Who knows!' she retorted. � He let his black eyes rest on her face for som e minu tes, watchin g her, uncha nging and incompre hensib le. He was thinki ng, supe rficia lly, that if he liked, he coul d use the law and have her prev ented from leaving the country --or even from lea ving Sayula- - sinc e she was legally marrie d to him. There was the old fixity of Indi an ang er, glinting fixed and relentl ess in the depths of his eyes .

In the end it was that weir d, sul try, tropica l stup or of the hot hour s, a heat- swoon of shee r indi fferen ce. 'Com o quie res tu!' he said. 'As you wis h.' And she knew he had already releas ed her , in the dar k, sul try stup or of his blood. He wou ld mak e no further effor t afte r her. This also was the doom of his race . He took a boat and went down to Jamiltepec, to Ram n: as she knew � he would. She was alone, as usua l. It occur red to her, that she her self will ed thi s alon eness. She could not relax and be with these peop le. She cou ld not relax and be with anybo dy. She alw ays had to recoil upon her own indiv iduali ty, as a cat does. Sex, sexua l corr espond ence, did it matte r so very much to her? It migh t have matte red more, if she had not had it. But she had had it--and very fin ally and con summat ely, with Cipriano . So she knew all about it. It was as if she had conq uered anothe r terr itory, anot her field of life. The conque ress! And now she would retir e to the lai r of her own indiv iduali ty, with the prey. Sudd enly, she saw hers elf as men often saw her : the great cat, with its spasms of voluptuo usness and its lif elong lustfu l enjo yment of its own isolated , isol ated individ uality . Vol uptuou sly to enjoy a cont act. Then with a lustfu l feli ne gra tifica tion, to bre ak the cont act, and roa m alon e in a sense of power. Each time, to seiz e a sort of power, purring upon her own isol ated individ uality . She knew so many women like that. They played with love and inti macy as a cat with a mou se. In the end, they quickly ate up the love mouse, then trotted off with a full belly and a voluptu ous sens e of power. Only somet imes the lov e-mous e refu sed to be digested , and there was life -long dyspep sia. Or, like Cip riano, turne d into a sor t of serp ent, that reared and loo ked at her with glitteri ng eye s, the n slid away into the voi d, lea ving her bla nk, the sens e of power gone out of her . Anot her thing, she had obser ved, with a touch of hor ror. One after the other, her women 'friend s', the powe rful love- women, at the age of forty, forty- five, fifty, they lost all the ir cha rm and allur e, and turned into real grimalk ins, greyish , avid , and horrif ying, prow ling around lookin g for prey that became scarcer and scarcer .

And they remai ned these grey- ribb ed gri malkin s, dre ssed in eleg ant clothes, the grimalk in how l even passi ng int o thei r smar t chat ter."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"Kate was a wise woman, wise enough to take a lesson. It is all very well for a woman to culti vate her ego , her indi vidual ity.

'Wom an has suffe red far more from the suppress ion of her ego tha n from sex suppres sion,' says a woma n writ er, and it may wel l be true . But look, only look at the modern women of fifty and fift y- five , thos e who have cultiva ted their ego to the top of their bent! Usua lly, they are grim alkins to fill one with pity or with repu lsion. Kate knew all this. And as she sat alon e in her vil la, she reme mbered it again. She had had her fling, even here in Mexico . And these men would let her go aga in. She was no prisoner . She coul d carr y off any spoil she had captur ed. And then what! To sit in a London drawi ng-roo m, and add another to all the grimalki ns? To let the peculiar grima lkin- grimace come on her face, the most wei rd gri malkin -twang come into her voi ce? Horr or! Of all the horrors, perha ps the grima lkin women, her cont empora ries, were the mos t repe llent to her . Eve n the horrid old tom- cat men of the civil ized roof gutters, did not fil l her with such sickly dread . 'No! ' she said to hers elf. 'My ego and my ind ividua lity are not wort h THAT ghast ly pri ce. I'd bet ter abandon some of my ego, and sink some of my indivi dualit y, rat her than go like that.' Afte r all, when Cipria no tou ched her car essive ly, all her body flow ered. That was the grea ter sex, tha t coul d fill all the wor ld with lustr e, and which she dared not thi nk abo ut, its powe r was so much great er tha n her own will.

But afte r a while, the won der faded, and a sort of jealo us emp tiness set in. 'I must have bot h,' she said to herself. 'I must not reco il against Cipriano and Ram n, they make my blood blossom in my body. � I say they are limited . But then one must be limite d. If ones trie s to be unli mited, one becomes horri ble. Withou t Cipr iano to touc h me and lim it me and submerge my will, I shall become a horr ible, elderl y fema le. I ought to WANT to be lim ited. I oug ht to be GLAD if a man will lim it me with a stron g will and a warm touc h.

Ah yes! Rath er tha n beco me eld erly and a bit gri sly, I will make my subm ission ; as far as I need , and no fur ther.' She called a man -serva nt, and set off down the lake in a row-boa t.

Some maize -field s show ed ser e stub ble, but the palo- blanco flower s were out, and the mesq uite bushes were frai l gree n, and there were wafts of per fume from the litt le yel low flow er-bal ls, like cas sia. 'Why shoul d I go away! ' said Kate. 'Why shoul d I see the buses on the mud of Picca dilly, on Christma s Eve, and the cro wds of peopl e on the wet pavem ents, under the big shop s like great caves of ligh t? I may as well stay here, where my soul is less dre ary. I shall have to tell Ram n I am sorry for the things I said. I won't � carp at them. After all, there is anoth er kin d of vastnes s here , with the sound of drum s, and the cry of Quetza lcoatl .' Alre ady she coul d see the yellow and red dish, tower- like upper stor y of Jamilte pec, and the rich, deep fall of mage nta boug ainvil lea, from the high wall, with the pale spr aying of plum bago flowers , and many loose creamy- colour ed ros es. 'Est n tocando!' said her boatman quietly, looking up at her with � dark , preg nant eyes. He had hea rd alr eady the sou nd of the light drum at Jamilt epec. The boat rowed softly: and there came a sound of a man's voice sing ing in the morning . Her boatma n lift ed an oar, as a signal to the house. And as the boat round ed the curve into the basin, a man- servant in white clot hes came run ning down to the little jetty. In the cha ngeles s suns hine was a scent, perhap s of datura and of roses , and an eter nal Mexican silenc e, whi ch the noise of the drum , and the voice of singing , did not disturb. 'Is Don Cipriano here? ' aske d Kate . 'Est !' murmured the man, with a slight motion towards Ram n's � � balc ony, whence the singing came. 'Shal l I say you have come?'

A creepi ng pla nt, with gre at snak e-like cords , and big sulphur- and- brown trumpet flower s, hun g above. She listened to the singing. It was Ram n teaching one of � the singer s.

The man had sung this hymn over several times, halti ng and forg etting , his pure, burnin g voic e falt ering out; then the low, rather husky voice of Ram n, with a subtler intensity, coming in, � as if hear d from the centre of a shell; then again the sud den"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"ripp ing sound of the true singer's tenor , goin g like a fla me thro ugh the bloo d.

His toes sprea d dark and hard, in his open huarach es, and the black braid of his hat- string hung agains t his dark cheek.
