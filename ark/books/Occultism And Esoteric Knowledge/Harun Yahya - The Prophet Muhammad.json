He was a living example of the sublime morality of Allah’s last revelation. He was a friend of Allah and inspired humanity by his nearness to Him.

(Surat al-Ahzab: 21) Although we have never seen the Prophet (saas), we can still do our very best to come to know his exemplary behaviour, his sayings and the pleasing morality he displayed, by means of the verses of the Qur’an and the hadiths.

The aim in writing this book is to introduce various characteristics of the Prophet Muhammad (saas), by revealing his devotion, superior morality and noble character. ABOUT THE AUTHOR The author, who writes under the pen-name Harun Yahya, was born in Ankara in 1956. He studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University, and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in helping many to return their faith in Allah, and, in many others, to gain a deeper insight into their faith. Harun Yahya's books appeal to all kinds of readers, regardless of their age, race, or nationality, for they focus on one objective: to broaden the reader’s perspective by encouraging him or her to think about a number of critical issues, such as the existence of Allah and His unity, and to live by the values He prescribed for them."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"T T O O T T H H E E R R E E A A D D E E R R The reason why a special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution is that this theory consti- tutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation, and therefore the existence of Allah, during the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. Therefore, showing that this theory is a de- ception is a very important duty, which is strongly related to the religion. It is im- perative that this important service be rendered to everyone. Some of our readers may find the chance to read only one of our books. Therefore, we think it appro- priate to spare a chapter for a summary of this subject. In all the books by the author, faith-related issues are explained in the light of Qur'anic verses, and people are invited to learn Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects that concern Allah's verses are explained in such a way as to leave no room for doubt or question marks in the reader's mind. The sincere, plain and fluent style employed ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand the books. This effective and lucid narrative makes it possible to read them in a single sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spiritual- ity are influenced by the facts recounted in these books and cannot refute the truth- fulness of their contents. This book and all the other works by Harun Yahya can be read individually or discussed in a group. Those readers who are willing to profit from the books will find discussion very useful in that they will be able to relate their own reflec- tions and experiences to one another. In addition, it is a great service to the religion to contribute to the presenta- tion and circulation of these books, which are written solely for the good pleasure of Allah. All the books of the author are extremely convincing, so, for those who want to communicate the religion to other people, one of the most effective meth- ods is to encourage them to read these books. It is hoped that the reader will take time to look through the review of other books on the final pages of the book, and appreciate the rich source of material on faith-related issues, which are very useful and a pleasure to read. In them, one will not find, as in some other books, the personal views of the author, explanations based on dubious sources, styles unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, or hopeless, doubt-creating, and pessimistic accounts that create deviations in the heart. The letters \"saas\" used after the Prophet Muhammad's name are abbrevi- ations for the words \"Salla Allahu 'Alaihi Wa Sallam,\" which means \"may the blessing and the peace of Allah be upon him.\" When the name of Prophet Muhammad is mentioned, a Muslim is to respect him and invoke this statement of peace upon him."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"HARUN YAHYA THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD (SAAS)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The author, who writes under the pen-name HARUN YAHYA, was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he then studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important works disclosing the im- posture of evolutionists, the invalidity of their claims and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and bloody ideologies such as fascism and communism. His pen-name is made up of the names \"Harun\" (Aaron) and \"Yahya\" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the cover of the books is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad, the last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and sunnah, the author makes it his purpose to disprove each one of the funda- mental tenets of godless ideologies and to have the \"last word\", so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used as a sign of his intention of saying this last word. All author' s works center around one goal: to convey the Qur' an' s message to people, encourage them to think about basic faith- r elated issues (such as the existence of God, His unity and the Hereafter), and to expose the feeble foundations and perverted ide- ologies of godless systems. Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur T urkish, and Indonesian, and they are enjoyed by readers world- wide. Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering their faith in God and in many others gaining a deeper insight into their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style gives these books a distinct touch which directly effects any one who reads or studies them. Immune to objections, these works are characterized A A b b o o u u t t T T h h e e A A u u t t h h o o r r"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"by their features of rapid effectiveness, definite results and ir- r efutability. It is unlikely that those who read these books and give serious thought to them can any longer sincerely advocate the ma- terialistic philosophy, atheism or any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a senti- mental insistence since these books refuted such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the collection of books writ- ten by Harun Yahya. There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity of the Qur'an. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for God's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works. Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which open the \"eyes\" of the heart and guide them to be- come more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to prop- agate other books which create confusion in peoples' minds, lead man into ideological chaos, and which, clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in peoples' hearts, as also ver- ified from previous experience. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Qur'an. The success and impact of this service are manifest in readers' conviction. One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and all the ordeals the majority of peo- ple undergo is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This state can only be ended with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by con- veying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that peo- ple can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which leads people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is clear that this service has to be provided more speed- ily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. It is no exaggeration to say that the collection of books by Harun Yahya have assumed this leading role. By the will of God, these books will be a means through which people in the 21st cen- tury will attain the peace, justice and happiness promised in the Qur'an."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"All translations from the Qur'an are from The Noble Qur'an: a New Rendering of its Meaning in English by Hajj Abdalhaqq and Aisha Bewley, published by Bookwork, Norwich, UK. 1420 CE/1999 AH. www.harunyahya.com ISBN 983-9384-38-4 Translated by: Carl Rossini Edited by: David Livingstone PUBLISHED IN MALA YSIA BY : SABA ISLAMIC MEDIA 1-2-1, PRIMA PENINSULA, JALAN SETIAWANGSA 11, TAMAN SETIAWANGSA, 54200 KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA www.saba-islamic-media.com PRINTED BY : Kelebek Matbaacilik Istanbul / Turkey"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Contents Introduction 9 The Superb Morality of the Prophet (saas) as Related in the Q ur'an 13 The Prophet (saas)'s Manner of Communicating the Message of Allah 93 The Outward Appearance of the Prophet (saas) 139 The Exemplary Life of the Prophet (saas) 181 What the Prophet (saas) Said of the Future 205 Conclusion 258 The Evolution Deception 261 Introduction 9 The Superb Morality of the Prophet (saas) as Related in the Q ur'an 13 The Prophet (saas)'s Manner of Communicating the Message of Allah 93 The Outward Appearance of the Prophet (saas) 139 The Exemplary Life of the Prophet (saas) 181 What the Prophet (saas) Said of the Future 205 Conclusion 258 The Evolution Deception 261 Contents"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"s a verse of the Qur'an reveals, \"...

As the Prophet (saas) has r evealed in the hadith, \"Verily, I have left amongst you the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Apostle which if you hold fast, you shall never go astray ,\" 1 a Muslim's two truest guides are the Qur'an and Sunnah (the practice of the Prophet Muhammad (saas)). The Prophet Muhammad (saas) was an example to all humanity with his morality, to which he called on mankind to live by. It was the Prophet (saas) who said \" I was sent to perfect good character \" 2 and \"By One in whose hand there is my life: None shall enter Paradise except one who has got good conduct.\" 3 Those Muslims who follow the way of the Prophet (saas) need to be foremost in their morality and behavior, and to invite others to adopt that same morality. 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"n the Qur'an Allah has revealed that the Prophet (saas) possessed the finest morality, and says: N N u u n n . .

That demonstrates that he always displayed a pleasing morality, never departing from the way of Allah. As the Prophet (saas)'s words \"The most perfect believer in respect of faith is he who is best of them in manners.\" 4 make clear, morality is one the most important components of true faith. It is therefore an important re- ligious duty to learn about and practice the very best examples of it. This chapter will discuss a number of examples of that morality re commended by the Prophet (saas). 13 The Superb Morality of the Prophet (saas) as Related in the Q ur'an"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Prophet Muhammad (saas) T T h h e e P P r r o o p p h h e e t t ( ( s s a a a a s s ) ) p p r r a a c c t t i i c c e e d d o o n n l l y y t t h h a a t t w w h h i i c c h h w w a a s s r r e e v v e e a a l l e e d d t t o o h h i i m m One of the most important characteristics, frequently mentioned with regards to the Prophet (saas) in the Qur'an, is that he only practiced what Allah revealed and asked of him, with no concern about what oth- ers might think.

Most people, now as in the past, are consumed with desires, longings and pas- sions. Although the great majority believe in religion, they are unable to overcome those obsessions. Instead of giving up those desires, they make concessions when it comes to their religious obligations. They fail to carry out some of those obligations out of concern, for instance, over what their spouses, relatives or friends might say. Or, they are unable to give up habits that are unacceptable to the religion. They therefore inter- pret religion according to their own interests, accept those rules which suit them, and reject those which do not. The Prophet (saas) never made any concessions to what such peo- ple wanted. He conveyed the Qur'an to mankind with no alteration to what Allah had revealed, taking no one's personal interests into account, and did so simply in the spirit of fear of Allah. Allah speaks of the Prophet (saas)'s godliness ( taqwa ) in the Qur'an: B B y y t t h h e e s s t t a a r r w w h h e e n n i i t t d d e e s s c c e e n n d d s s , , y y o o u u r r c c o o m m p p a a n n i i o o n n i i s s n n o o t t m m i i s s g g u u i i d d e e d d o o r r m m i i s s l l e e d d ; ; n n o o r r d d o o e e s s h h e e s s p p e e a a k k f f r r o o m m w w h h i i m m . .

We must not forget that the Prophet Muhammad (saas), one of Allah's most God-fearing servants, was also tested with great difficulties and trying circumstances. There were people ready to create various kinds of difficulty in the communities he addressed. They tried to plot against the Prophet (saas) by behaving hypocritically. Polytheists refused to abandon the religion of their ancestors, others asked the Prophet (saas) to bring them a sign to suit their best interests, they tried to kill, arrest or exile the Prophet (saas), and, basi- cally, placed all kinds of difficulties in his path. The Prophet (saas) was always patient with the unbelievers. He con- tinued to communicate the religion of Allah and to instruct Muslims in the Qur'an while he protected them from danger. The source of that determina- tion, success and courage lay his strong faith in Allah, his godliness and submission.

He relied on and trusted in Him. In return for that submission, Allah granted him strength and success. Allah instructed the Prophet (saas) to be patient in the face of those who made problems for him, and he was faithful to that prescription throughout his life.

In one verse, Allah tells believers: \"Say: 'My prayer and my rites, my living and my dying, are for Allah alone, the Lord of all the worlds.'\" (Surat al-An‘am: 162) In the following verse, believers are told to live their religion solely for Allah, and not for any other purpose: \"Except those who repent and put things right and hold fast to Allah and dedicate their religion to Allah alone; they are with the believers. Allah will give the believers an immense reward.\" (Surat an-Nisa': 146) Anyone who holds fast to Allah, knows that there is no other god than Allah, lives his life solely to gain His good pleasure, and never, ever abandons his faith in Him, shows he has true faith. No sincere believer tries to gain the love, good will, praise of anyone other than Allah in his actions and religious duties. The finest examples of such sincere believers are the Prophet Muhammad (saas) and other prophets (peace be upon them all). The Prophet (saas) sought only to win Allah's good pleasure, and spent his life striving to win His mercy, compassion and Paradise, with never a thought for personal interests or worldly gain.

Deniers and polytheists, from among his own people, insulted him most terribly, even calling him a magician or a madman. Others wanted to kill him and even schemed to do so. Despite all that, the Prophet (saas) tried to teach people of all back- grounds and cultures about the Qur'an, and therefore about proper morality and good behavior. As is revealed in the verses of the Qur'an, some people had not the slightest idea of the basics of good manners, for which reason it never en- tered their minds that they might appall someone who possessed supe- rior morality. The Prophet (saas) displayed the greatest patience in this circumstances, turning to Allah and asking for His help in all situations and encouraging believers to patience and submission.

Those who despair at the slightest problem, who are unable to bear the smallest objection, who stop preaching the religion of Allah, or who lose hope when their business dealings go wrong, must be aware that such be- havior is incompatible with Allah's holy book and the sayings and deeds of the Prophet (saas). Believers must always be patient, take Allah as their helper and give thanks to Him, adopt the superior morality of the Prophet (saas), and hope for the mercy, compassion and Paradise of our Lord. 25"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"26 Charles Robertson, Mathaf Gallery, London"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"27"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Prophet Muhammad (saas) 28 T T h h e e P P r r o o p p h h e e t t ( ( s s a a a a s s ) ) w w a a s s a a l l w w a a y y s s t t o o l l e e r r a a n n t t o o f f t t h h o o s s e e a a r r o o u u n n d d h h i i m m As we have already seen, there were people with varying charac- ters and ideas that surrounded the Prophet (saas).

Instead he always used the pleasantest ways to tell them about it. He always supported the community of the faithful with his strong conscience, and was a benefactor to them at all times. On account of these traits, the Prophet (saas) is described in many verses as \" your compan- ion .\" (Surah Saba': 46: Surat an-Najm: 2, Surat at-Takwir: 22). Those believers who were able to comprehend the conscientious- ness of the Prophet (saas) regarded him as closer to them than all others, and humbled themselves towards him.

He used to call his companions by their surnames with hon- our and he used to give one surname who had no surname. ... He was very affectionate and kind in dealing with the people. ...

Whether they are rich or poor, Allah is well able to look after them. Do not follow your own desires and deviate from the truth...\" (Surat an-Nisa': 135). W ith the rules he imposed on Muslims, his just and tolerant atti- tude towards those of other religions, languages, races and tribes, and his way of not discriminating between rich and poor, but treating everybody equally, Allah's Messenger (saas) is a great ex- ample to all of mankind. Allah says this to His Prophet (saas) in one verse: T T h h e e y y a a r r e e p p e e o o p p l l e e w w h h o o l l i i s s t t e e n n t t o o l l i i e e s s a a n n d d c c o o n n s s u u m m e e i i l l l l - - g g o o t t - - t t e e n n g g a a i i n n s s . .

He became an example for all times with the words, \"My Lord has commanded justice...\" (Surat al-A‘raf: 29). A number of incidents testify to the Prophet (saas)'s justice. He lived in a place where people of different religions, languages, races and tribes all co-existed. It was very difficult for those soci- eties to live together in peace and security, and to check those who 32"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"sought to spread dissension. One group could grow aggressive to- wards and even attack another over the slightest word or action. Y et, the justice of the Prophet (saas) was a source of peace and se- curity for those other communities, just as much as it was for Muslims. During the time of the Prophet (saas), Christians, Jews and pagans were all treated equally. The Prophet (saas) abided by the verse \"There is no compulsion where the religion is con- cerned...\" (Surat al-Baqara: 256), explaining the true religion to everyone, but leaving them free to make up their own minds. In another verse, Allah revealed to the Prophet (saas) the kind of justice and and conciliation he needed to adopt towards those of other religions: S S o o c c a a l l l l a a n n d d g g o o s s t t r r a a i i g g h h t t a a s s y y o o u u h h a a v v e e b b e e e e n n o o r r d d e e r r e e d d t t o o . .

The Prophet (saas)'s justice brought about understanding between people of different races.

Let the people cease to boast about their ancestors.\" 10 \"These genealogies of yours are not a reason to revile anyone. You are all children of Adam. No one has any superiority over another except in religion and taqwa (godliness).\" 11 During his final sermon, the Prophet (saas) called on Muslims in these terms: \"There is no superiority for an Arab over a non-Arab and for a non-Arab over an Arab; nor for white over the black nor for the black over the white except in piety. V erily the noblest among you is he who is the most pious.\" 12 The agreement made with the Christians of Najran in the south of the Arabian Peninsula was another fine example of the justice of the Prophet (saas). One of the articles in the agreement r eads: \"The lives of the people of Najran and its surrounding area, their religion, their land, property, cattle and 35"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"those of them who are present or absent, their messen- gers and their places of worship are under the protection of Allah and guardianship of His Prophet.\" 13 The Compact of Medina, signed by the Muslim immigrants from Mecca, the indigenous Muslims of Medina and the Jews of Medina is another important example of justice. As a result of this constitution, which established justice between communities with differing beliefs and ensured the protection of their various inter- ests, long years of enmity were brought to an end. One of the most outstanding features of the treaty is the freedom of belief it estab- lished. The relevant article reads: \"The Jews of Banu 'Awf are one nation with the Muslims; the Jews have their religion and the Muslims have theirs...\" 14 Article 16 of the treaty reads: \"The Jew who follows us is surely entitled to our support and the same equal rights as any one of us. He shall not be wronged nor his enemy be assisted.\" 15 The Prophet (saas)'s companions remained true to that article in the treaty, even after his death, and even practiced it with regard to Berbers, Buddhists, Brahmans and people of other beliefs. One of the main reasons why the golden age of Islam was one of peace and security was the Prophet (saas)'s just attitude, it- self a reflection of Qur'anic morality. The justice of the Prophet (saas) also awoke feelings of con- fidence in non-Muslims, and many, including polytheists, asked to be taken under his protection.

Those who rebel against these messengers, on the other hand, rebel against Allah. Some of these verses are: W W h h o o e e v v e e r r o o b b e e y y s s t t h h e e M M e e s s s s e e n n g g e e r r h h a a s s o o b b e e y y e e d d A A l l l l a a h h . .

Muslims, therefore, referred to him in all matters, and sought his permission and opinion before engaging in anything. On subjects they were unable to agree upon among them- selves, though even on matters they were able to solve by themselves, or when they received news concerning the security, health or econ- omy of the community of the faithful, they immediately took them to the Prophet (saas) and abided by the sure and trustworthy advice or solution he recommended. This is a most important aspect of morality, commanded by Allah in the Qur'an. In one verse, for instance, He orders all news to be forwarded to the Prophet (saas) or those representing him. The verse r eads: W W h h e e n n n n e e w w s s o o f f a a n n y y m m a a t t t t e e r r r r e e a a c c h h e e s s t t h h e e m m t t h h e e y y s s p p r r e e a a d d i i t t a a b b o o u u t t , , w w h h e e t t h h e e r r i i t t i i s s o o f f a a r r e e a a s s s s u u r r i i n n g g o o r r d d i i s s q q u u i i e e t t i i n n g g n n a a t t u u r r e e . .

For one thing, each order and rule of the Prophet (saas) is guaranteed by Allah. Furthermore, the Prophet (saas) was the wisest and cleverest member of the community of the faithful. Usually, most look to consult the most in- telligent person and the one who best obeys his conscience, that is, the person they trust the most in any matter, in order to establish a decision. As well as all these characteristics of the Prophet (saas), another wisdom in all news being gathered together in one person is that this will provide the best and most intelligent response because all the aspects of the event will be known by one person. In another verse, Allah com- mands the faithful to make the Prophet (saas) their judge in any dis- agreements between them. It is a command from Allah that all such disagreements should be taken to the Prophet (saas) at once, and that is therefore the most fitting course of action in terms of reason, morality and conscience. It is also most important to obey the rules set out by the Prophet (saas), with all one's heart and with no reservations. Even if his decision conflicts with the interests of an individual, true believers will feel no doubts at all, and will immediately obey the command of the Prophet (saas).

The igno- rant are unable to use what they know for beneficial ends, for the good and security of mankind. They use it for gossip and to try to spread dis- sension, to turn people against one another and to plot against them. The Prophet (saas), however, used all the information that was brought to him for the peace, security and health of Muslims and other groups under his protection, to avoid possible dangers and to thwart plots against believers. Identifying those whose faith was weak, he took mea- sures to strengthen that faith, and prevented anything that might have weakened the faithful or damaged their morale. He brought in measures that would bring them good and lead to desirable outcomes. That is why Allah refers to him as \"an ear of good\" in one verse. All of the Prophet (saas)'s words, decisions and measures have led to good and positive results for believers as well as mankind."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"44"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"45"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Prophet Muhammad (saas) T T h h e e P P r r o o p p h h e e t t ( ( s s a a a a s s ) ) w w a a r r n n e e d d a a n n d d r r e e m m i i n n d d e e d d p p e e o o p p l l e e i i n n s s u u c c h h a a w w a a y y a a s s t t o o i i n n f f l l u u e e n n c c e e t t h h e e i i r r c c o o n n s s c c i i e e n n c c e e The Prophet (saas) spent all his life, once the Qur'an had been re- vealed to him, calling people to the religion and guiding them to the true path. In one verse, Allah tells the Prophet (saas) how he should address people: S S a a y y : : \" \" T T h h i i s s i i s s m m y y w w a a y y . .

Since not everyone was on the true path, people made life difficult for the Prophet (saas), out of jealousy, hatred and envy. Some were slow to understand his words and dragged their feet when they did so, some behaved hypocritically, saying that they believed his words when they really did not. The Prophet (saas) con- tinued to explain the religion with great determination, paying no heed to all those obstacles. Such people's attitudes are revealed in a verse: ... ...

The attitude displayed by those people in the face of what he had to say is described in Surat an-Nisa': D D o o y y o o u u n n o o t t s s e e e e t t h h o o s s e e w w h h o o c c l l a a i i m m t t h h a a t t t t h h e e y y b b e e l l i i e e v v e e i i n n w w h h a a t t h h a a s s b b e e e e n n s s e e n n t t d d o o w w n n t t o o y y o o u u a a n n d d w w h h a a t t w w a a s s s s e e n n t t d d o o w w n n b b e e f f o o r r e e y y o o u u , , s s t t i i l l l l d d e e s s i i r r i i n n g g t t o o t t u u r r n n t t o o a a s s a a t t a a n n i i c c s s o o u u r r c c e e f f o o r r j j u u d d g g e e m m e e n n t t i i n n s s p p i i t t e e o o f f b b e e i i n n g g o o r r d d e e r r e e d d t t o o r r e e j j e e c c t t i i t t ? ?

Yet, for someone who, like the Prophet (saas), has put his trust in Allah, who knows that faith is a gift from Him, and fears Allah alone, and not anyone else, Allah will provide assistance and support. In several verses of the Qur'an, Allah reveals that He has sent mes- sengers in order to turn those who have strayed back to the true path, to purify them, and to teach them the holy verses. As we have seen above, throughout his life, the Prophet (saas) persevered in the responsibility that Allah had laid on him with great patience, fortitude and determina- tion. Even in the final sermon that he gave, very shortly before dying, he continued to teach and instruct Muslims. Allah sets out these beautiful responsibilities in a number of verses: F F o o r r t t h h i i s s W W e e s s e e n n t t a a M M e e s s s s e e n n g g e e r r t t o o y y o o u u f f r r o o m m a a m m o o n n g g y y o o u u t t o o r r e e c c i i t t e e O O u u r r S S i i g g n n s s t t o o y y o o u u a a n n d d p p u u r r i i f f y y y y o o u u a a n n d d t t e e a a c c h h y y o o u u t t h h e e B B o o o o k k a a n n d d W W i i s s d d o o m m a a n n d d t t e e a a c c h h y y o o u u t t h h i i n n g g s s y y o o u u d d i i d d n n o o t t k k n n o o w w b b e e f f o o r r e e . .

The Prophet (saas) himself described how such people ought to be- have: \"Make things easy for the people, and do not make it difficult for them, and make them calm (with glad tidings) and do not re- pulse (them).\" 20 Giving welcome news increases believers' enthusiasm and morale, and encourages them to be more determined and persevering in their labors in the way of Allah. Someone who hopes to be rewarded with Paradise will of course have a very different attitude and state of mind than someone who regards those labors as monotonous, or carries them out of habit or a sense of obligation. That is why Allah has commanded His Messenger (saas) to: \"Spur on the believers.\" (Surat an-Nisa': 84)"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Prophet Muhammad (saas) 58 In another verse, Allah says: \"Give good news to the believers that they will receive immense favor from Allah\" (Surat al-Ahzab: 47). Every believer who abides by Allah's commandments and the morality of the Prophet (saas) is responsible for giving good news to Muslims, and for encouraging them. It is not proper for a Muslim to speak in a manner that is negative, to make easy tasks appear difficult, and thus, to discourage the faithful, to forget the beautiful things and good news Allah has re- vealed in the Qur'an, thereby leading the faithful to become pessimistic. What is in conformity with the Qur'an is, like the manner of the Prophet (saas), to recall the good things promised to the faithful by Allah, and to keep to revitalize them.

People are easily prone to making their lives difficult, and to imposing rules upon themselves, by which they falsely believe they have solved their problems. This particular human characteristic is one of the reasons why the reli- gion has been distorted through the years. Many societies have dreamed up rules that did not actually exist in the religion, and then made themselves and others believe that they would only be truly god-fearing when they adhered to them. One of the Prophet (saas)'s most important qualities was the way he lifted such bur- dens that people had imposed on themselves.

The Prophet (saas) was both a model for people in his own lifetime, as well as one who lifted such burdens from people, as the verse indicates, by calling them to righteousness and warning them against wicked- ness. One of the subjects in which the Prophet (saas) was a splen- 64"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"did example was godliness, that is, that behavior intended to earn Allah's approval alone. He feared only Allah, and never strayed from the true path, never succumbing to people's whims and de- sires. This aspect of the morality of the Qur'an is actually a source of great ease and beauty for people. Trying to please others and to make oneself favored by others, trying to win the pleasure of both Allah and others, and seeking praise from them, are great hinder- ences to whatever one does. Such people are unable to think and behave honestly as they would otherwise like to, and, since they are unable to please everyone all together, they ultimately fail to r eceive the praise they were looking for. They panic at the slightest mistake, and fear that they have lost the confidence and respect of those they are trying to please when they see that they are not fully happy with them. On the contrary, Muslims who strive only for the pleasure of Allah, and fear only Him, never suffer the burden of things that will be harmful to them in this world and the next. They do not worry about whether or not people will be pleased with them. They are therefore always at peace. Since they know that, in the event of a mistake they will have to explain themselves only to Allah and need seek forgiveness only from Him, they feel no con- cern or worry. By his words and behavior, the Prophet (saas) taught the faithful to live with purity of faith. He thus lifted the heavy weight of \"gaining the pleasure of others\" from all of humanity. That, of course, is but one of the difficulties believers experienced that he did away with. The Prophet Muhammad (saas) was an example to all Muslims in many matters that will bring good and great bless- ings in this world and in the hereafter. Allah has revealed that someone with purity of faith would not be the same as one who worships others besides Allah: A A l l l l a a h h h h a a s s m m a a d d e e a a m m e e t t a a p p h h o o r r f f o o r r t t h h e e m m o o f f a a m m a a n n o o w w n n e e d d b b y y s s e e v v e e r r a a l l p p a a r r t t n n e e r r s s i i n n d d i i s s p p u u t t e e w w i i t t h h o o n n e e a a n n o o t t h h e e r r a a n n d d a a n n - - 65"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Prophet Muhammad (saas) o o t t h h e e r r m m a a n n w w h h o o l l l l y y o o w w n n e e d d b b y y a a s s i i n n g g l l e e m m a a n n . .

He relieved them of all burdens that made life difficult for them, called them to the best and easiest way of life, and found solutions to all problems. That is why those who abide by the Sunnah of Allah's Messenger (saas) live in comfort and at peace. Some of the hadiths on this subject state: \"The Prophet sent Mu'adh and Abu Musa to Yemen telling them. 'Treat the people with ease and don't be hard on them; give them glad tidings and don't fill them with aversion; and love each other, and don't differ'.\" 21 \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not have to choose between two matters, but that he chose the easier of them as long as it was not a wrong action. If it was a wrong action, he was the furthest of people from it.\" 22 66"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"67"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Prophet Muhammad (saas) T T h h e e P P r r o o p p h h e e t t ( ( s s a a a a s s ) ) w w a a s s m m o o s s t t c c o o n n s s i i d d e e r r a a t t e e a a n n d d c c o o m m p p a a s s s s i i o o n n a a t t e e t t o o w w a a r r d d s s t t h h e e f f a a i i t t h h f f u u l l The Prophet (saas) was a compassionate man, full of love and under- standing.

It must not be forgotten that only Allah gives peace and tranquility to the heart. Allah makes the prayers of His Messenger (saas), whom He has appointed as guardian and protector of the faithful, a means whereby they come by comfort and ease. Our Lord's love and com- passion, and His protection and mercy for the faithful is most clearly repre- sented in the morality of the Prophet (saas). These words of the Prophet (saas) reminded the faithful that prayer was an important matter: \"When you are praying do not say; 'O Allah, forgive me if You wish. O Allah, forgive me if you wish.' You should be firm in your asking, for there is no compelling Him.\" 26 70"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"71"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Prophet Muhammad (saas) T T h h e e a a l l m m s s t t h h e e P P r r o o p p h h e e t t ( ( s s a a a a s s ) ) c c o o l l l l e e c c t t e e d d f f o o r r t t h h e e b b e e n n e e f f i i t t o o f f t t h h e e f f a a i i t t h h f f u u l l w w e e r r e e a a m m e e a a n n s s w w h h e e r r e e b b y y t t h h e e y y w w e e r r e e p p u u r r i i f f i i e e d d At the beginning of Surat at-Tawba, verse 103, Allah commands, \"Take from their wealth a charity to purify and cleanse them and pray for them.\" In other words, He reveals that by means of the alms he re- ceived, the Prophet (saas), the beloved servant of Allah, purified the faithful. The Prophet (saas) is the Messenger of Allah, and remains on the path shown by Allah in all his words and deeds. The source of the Prophet (saas)'s higher morality and noble character is that he always turned to Allah, without falling into the error of worshipping others be- sides Allah. It was because he obeyed every command given by Allah, he came to possess a morality and behavior of matchless quality, a model to all the world. This truth must serve as a guide for all Muslims and believers. Their morality and behavior, too, must be an example to all the world, by means of their abiding by the Qur'an, which is the revelation of Allah, and the morality taught by the Prophet (saas). 72"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"73"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Prophet Muhammad (saas) T T h h e e P P r r o o p p h h e e t t ( ( s s a a a a s s ) ) w w o o u u l l d d c c o o n n s s u u l l t t w w i i t t h h t t h h e e f f a a i i t t h h f f u u l l In accordance with a command from Allah, the Prophet (saas) would consult with the faithful and seek their opinion. This was commanded in the following verse: ... ...

( ( S S u u r r a a h h A A l l ' ' I I m m r r a a n n : : 1 1 5 5 9 9 ) ) After canvassing the opinions of the faithful, the Prophet (saas) would come to a decision and place the outcome in the hands of Allah. One important fact that must not be lost sight of is that all decisions are known beforehand by Allah. Allah has decreed every decision and its outcome. It is an act of worship on all believers to consult and then arrive at a decision. Knowing that, the Prophet (saas) would consult the faithful before coming to a decision, though, while leaving the outcome of that decision to Allah, he knew that Allah would produce the most beneficial outcome from it. Consulting with others is an approach that can bring about the most auspicious results for Muslims. In the first place, anyone who consults oth- ers demonstrates better morality by acting modestly. For instance, the Prophet (saas) was the wisest of the community of the faithful, and had the greatest foresight and understanding. Despite that, how- ever, his consulting those around him and asking their opinion, 74"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"75 enquiring how they would resolve a particular matter, shows what a mod- est person he truly was. The faithful must display humility in all matters, not thinking that they know better than everyone else. They will gain great benefits from consulting with others. By adopting this manner of the Prophet (saas), they will come to re semble him, and will earn the good pleasure of Allah and the faithful by practicing the humility and affection that he showed the believers. They will also avoid pride of their own intelligence. In the Qur'an, Allah has revealed that: \"... Over everyone with knowledge is a Knower...\" (Surah Yusuf: 76) meaning that a person can arrive at better results by not relying on his own in- telligence alone but by making use also of the intelligence, ideas and accumu- lated experience of others. Instead of one mind, he will actually possess the number of however many people he consults. The Prophet reminded the faithful that they ought to consult one another in these words: \"Every people who seek the pleasure of Allah and consult with one another are guided to the best course in their affairs.\" 27 Every path shown to mankind by Allah in the Qur'an, and all behav- ior displayed by the Prophet (saas), are the most auspicious and best. Consulting others is one such example. It is therefore most important to be familiar with Allah's commandments and to know the character of the Prophet (saas) well to perform our religious obligations as well as possible, and to be of good moral character.

For 1,400 years, billions of people have loved and respected the Prophet (saas), felt close to him despite never having seen him, and prayed to be with him in Heaven for all eternity.

Many people strive for fame and honour all their lives. They are obsessed by it, seeking the allurements of this transient world. Or else, they puff themselves up with arrogance. Though they strive for honour, they in the end lose it. In fact, a person can only find fame and honour in the sight of Allah, Who reveals that that can only come by living the morality of the Qur'an.

The Prophet Muhammad (saas), on the other hand, was very thoughtful, courteous, patient and civilized, and treated such people nevertheless with the greatest tolerance. Also, in the most pleasant manner, he warned those around him against behavior that would make others uncomfort- able, and thus won their sympathy, teaching them through patience and perseverence.

He was able to communicate with and win the hearts of people whose social status, ways of life and customs were very different from one another, he exhibited understanding, patience and a desirable attitude.

Yet, he abided by Allah's command and took no notice of their oppression and ani- mosity. Allah commands the Prophet (saas) thus in one verse: P P r r o o c c l l a a i i m m w w h h a a t t y y o o u u h h a a v v e e b b e e e e n n o o r r d d e e r r e e d d t t o o a a n n d d t t u u r r n n a a w w a a y y f f r r o o m m t t h h e e i i d d o o l l a a t t o o r r s s . .

( ( S S u u r r a a t t a a l l - - H H i i j j r r : : 9 9 4 4 - - 9 9 5 5 ) ) Muslims in our own time too must explain the morality of the Qur'an to people, ignoring any lack of approval and whatever anyone might say to oppose them. They must not fear \"the blame of any blamer,\" as the Prophet (saas) did. That is a sign of morality and godliness that will be rewarded with Paradise. The Prophet (saas) commanded Muslims to abide by that Sunnah in these words, \"Convey my teaching to the people even if it were a single sentence.\" 35 T T h h e e P P r r o o p p h h e e t t ( ( s s a a a a s s ) ) e e x x p p l l a a i i n n e e d d t t h h a a t t A A l l l l a a h h p p o o s s s s e e s s s s e e s s i i n n f f i i n n i i t t e e m m i i g g h h t t In order that people should appreciate the power of Allah and adopt a nobler morality out of awe of Him, the Prophet (saas) used to tell people of the might of Allah and of the proofs of the splendour in His creation. He thus became the means whereby they would love Allah and fear him.

The Prophet (saas) also reminded people of that same fact. He said that in times of trouble or loss people have no other helper than Allah.

It is the hidden idolatry: A person stands to pray and he beautifies his prayer because he sees the people looking at him.\" 39 \"Idolatry is more hidden in my Ummah than the creeping of ants across a great smooth stone on a black night...\" 40 The Prophet (saas) 's Manner of Communicating the Message of Allah 101"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"102"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"T T h h e e P P r r o o p p h h e e t t ( ( s s a a a a s s ) ) r r e e v v e e a a l l e e d d t t h h a a t t o o n n l l y y A A l l l l a a h h c c a a n n k k n n o o w w t t h h e e u u n n s s e e e e n n The word \" ghaib \" in the Qur'an is used for hidden things that man cannot see or know.

For example, someone may try to prevent his friends from carrying out a religious obligation and say, \"I will accept that sin myself.\" Of course that person will be commit- ting the sin of preventing the carrying out of an obligation, but his friend will still be committing the sin of not carrying it out. In other words, no- body can lift that sin from another's shoulders. On the Day of Reckoning, people will only be held responsible for their own deeds. Nobody will be asked about the sins of others, and nobody's sins will be attributed to anyone else.

These are some of the Prophet (saas)'s warnings with regards to arrogance: \"Verily, Allah is Graceful and He loves Grace. Pride is dis- daining the truth (out of self-conceit) and contempt for the peo- ple.\" 54 \"Arrogance means ridiculing and rejecting the Truth and de- spising people.\" 55 The Prophet (saas) warned those who boasted of their families and ancestry, thus becoming arrogant, saying: \"Allah, Most High, has removed from you the pride of the pre- Islamic period and its boasting in ancestors. One is only a pi- ous believer or a miserable sinner. You are sons of Adam, and Adam came from dust. Let the people cease to boast about their ancestors. They are merely fuel in Hell; or they will certainly be of less account with Allah than the beetle which rolls dung with its nose.\" 56 The Prophet (saas) recommended to his followers to always dress well and to be pleasant in appearance and to look well cared for.

One verse on the subject reads: S S a a y y : : \" \" I I t t h h a a s s b b e e e e n n r r e e v v e e a a l l e e d d t t o o m m e e t t h h a a t t a a b b a a n n d d o o f f t t h h e e j j i i n n n n l l i i s s - - t t e e n n e e d d a a n n d d s s a a i i d d , , ' ' W W e e h h a a v v e e h h e e a a r r d d a a m m o o s s t t a a m m a a z z i i n n g g R R e e c c i i t t a a t t i i o o n n . .

That superstitious religion that the jinn had believed in is also described in that Sura: H H e e — — e e x x a a l l t t e e d d b b e e t t h h e e M M a a j j e e s s t t y y o o f f o o u u r r L L o o r r d d ! ! — — h h a a s s n n e e i i t t h h e e r r w w i i f f e e n n o o r r s s o o n n . .

( ( S S u u r r a a t t a a l l - - J J i i n n n n : : 3 3 - - 5 5 ) ) Ye t another verse recounts that when the Prophet (saas) rose for his r eligious obligations, the jinn would gather around him: W W h h e e n n t t h h e e s s e e r r v v a a n n t t o o f f A A l l l l a a h h s s t t a a n n d d s s c c a a l l l l i i n n g g o o n n H H i i m m , , t t h h e e y y a a l l - - m m o o s s t t s s w w a a r r m m a a l l l l o o v v e e r r h h i i m m . . ( ( S S u u r r a a t t a a l l - - J J i i n n n n : : 1 1 9 9 ) ) As that verse makes clear, the Prophet Muhammad (saas) was sent as a prophet for all men and the jinn. The Qur'an is a guide for both mankind and the jinn. 122"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"123"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"124"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"125"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"T T h h e e P P r r o o p p h h e e t t ( ( s s a a a a s s ) ) ' ' s s w w a a r r n n i i n n g g s s t t o o t t h h o o s s e e w w h h o o d d e e n n i i e e d d h h i i m m Those who denied the Qur'an and the Prophet (saas) placed a number of difficulties in his path, and tried to prevent him communi- cating his message, and, even to kill, arrest or exile him.

For example, shortly before his daughter Fatimah gave birth to his two grandchildren, he told her: \"When there is a birth, do nothing to the child without informing me.\" 177 After the babies had been born he instructed on how they were to be fed, looked after and protected. The Prophet (saas) also prayed for new-born babies, for his chil- dren and grandchildren, and for the children of his companions. As he held them on his knee or watched them playing, he would ask Allah to give them long and prosperous lives, as well as wisdom and faith. At every opportunity he would pray for his grandchildren Hassan and Hussein, saying that the prayer he used was the same as that Abraham used for Isaac and Ismail. 178"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"191 Ibn Abbas (ra), one of his companions, relates how when he was a child, the Prophet (saas) said, \" Allah, teach him wisdom. \" During the childhood of Anas bin Malik, another of his companions, he prayed to Allah to give him much wealth, many children and a long life, and that these would be auspicious for him. 179 The Prophet (saas) attached great importance to children's play, and sometimes even joined in with them. He recommended parents to play with their children, saying, \"Let he who has a child be as a child with him.\" 180 He suggested that children play such games and sports as swim- ming, running and wrestling, and en- couraged his own grandchildren and the children of those around him to do so.

He came back to the tent of Fatima and said: Is the little chap (meaning Hassan) there? We were under the impression that his mother had detained him in order to bathe him and dress him and garland him with sweet garland. Not much time had passed that he (Hassan) came run- ning until both of them embraced each other, thereupon Allah's Messenger (saas) said: O Allah, I love him; love him and love one who loves him (Hassan)...\" 184 According to Anas bin Malik (ra), the Prophet (saas) used to often call his grandchildren, Hassan and Hussein, over to him and cuddle them. 185 Ibnu Rebi'ati'ibni Haris (ra) says: \"My father sent al-Fadl the son of Abbas and me to the Prophet (saas). When we came into his presence, he sat us down on his right and left, and embraced us more strongly than we had ever seen before.\" 186 The Prophet (saas) would often caress the heads of children and pray for them.

Amr Ibnu Hureys (ra) describes how his mother took him into the presence of the Prophet (saas), and how the latter would pat his head and pray that he would always receive his daily bread. When Abdullah Ibnu Utbe (ra) was five or six, he also recalls the Prophet (saas) patting his head and praying he would have many descendants and live in plenty. 187 Abu Huraira (ra) provides the following examples of the Prophet Muhammad (saas)'s interest in and love for children: \"When the people saw the first fruit (of the season) they brought it to Allah's Apostle (saas). When he received it he said: \"O Allah, bless us in our fruits; and bless us in our city; and bless us in our sa's (a measurement unit) and bless us in our mudd (a measurement unit). He would then call to him the youngest child and give him those fruits.\" 188 \"Whenever he came back from a journey, the children of his household would be taken out to meet him.\" He (saas) used to hug them close to him, as 'Abd-Allah ibn Jafar (ra) said: \"Whenever the Prophet (saas) came back from a journey, we would be taken out to meet him. One day we met him, Hassan, Hussein and I. He carried one of us in front of him, and another on his back, until we entered Madina.\" 189 'Once the Prophet (saas) went out during the day... then he sat in the compound of Fatima's house and asked about the small boy (his grandson Hassan). After a while the boy came out run- ning and the Prophet (saas) embraced and kissed him'.\" 190 Jaabir bin Samurah (ra) has this to say on the subject: \"I prayed along with Allah's Messenger (saas) the first prayer. He then went to his family and I also went along with him when he met some children (on the way). He began to pat the cheeks of each one of them. He also patted my cheek and I experienced a coolness or a fragrance of his hand as if it had been brought out from the scent bag of a perfumer.\" 191 The Prophet Muhammad (saas) was sent at a time when female ba- bies were still killed at birth, but stressed that girls should not be dis- The Exemplary Life of the Prophet (saas) 193"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"criminated against in favor of boys, and that it was a sin to kill them.

The followoing is an example of what the Prophet (saas) said about female children: \"A daughter is a lovely child; affectionate, eager to help, mild and full of sacred feelings of motherhood.\" 192 The Prophet (saas) demonstrated his love in word and deed. He would tell children how much he loved them. 193 The Prophet (saas) never favored one child over another. He showed the same affection and compassion to the children of the faithful that he did to his own children and grandchildren. When Halid bin Said (ra) visited the Prophet (saas), there was a little girl by his side. The Prophet (saas) showed her special affection because she had been born in Abyssinia. On one occasion, the Prophet (saas) had a piece of embroi- dered fabric in his hands. He called the girl over and gave it to her, mak- ing her very happy. Jemre (ra) was a small child at the time. Her father would bring her into the presence of the Prophet (saas) and ask for him to pray to Allah to make her prosperous. The Prophet (saas) took Jemre (ra) in his lap, placed his hand on her head, and prayed. Usama (ra), the son of the Prophet (saas)'s assistant Zaid (ra), had this recollection of the Prophet (saas): \"Allah's Apostle (saas) used to put me on (one of) his thighs and Al-Hassan bin 'Ali on his other thigh, and then embraced us and said: 'O Allah! Please be Merciful to them, as I am mer- ciful to them'.\" 194 Some people were unable to understand why the Prophet (saas) played with children and took such an interest in them. On one accasion, Akra bin Habis (ra) saw the Prophet (saas) kissing Hassan (ra), and said: \" 'I have ten children and have never kissed one of them'.\" The The Prophet Muhammad (saas) 194"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Prophet (saas) looked at him and said, 'Those who show no mercy will be shown no mercy'.\" 195 The Prophet (saas)'s venerable son Ibrahim (ra) would frequently visit the house of his wet nurse, show her love and affection, and stroke her head. Anas bin Malik (ra), the servant of the Prophet (saas), has an- other recollection: \"I never saw anyone who was more compassionate towards chil- dren than the Messenger of Allah (saas). His son Ibrahim was in the care of a wet-nurse in the hills around Madinah. He would go there, and we would go with him, and he would enter the house, pick up his son and kiss him, then come back.\" 196 Our Prophet (saas) also warned the faithful to treat their children justly, and said: \"Fear Allah and treat your children with equal justice.\" 197 The Prophet (saas) also placed great emphasis on children's educa- tion and their being brought up with a proper morality, and showed the way by giving a great deal of advice on the matter. Some of the things he had to say are as follows: \"The best things that a man leaves behind after his death are a virtuous child who invokes Allah for him, a perpetual charity, the reward of which reaches him, and a beneficial knowledge which remains useful after him.\" 198 \"One of a child's duties to his father is to make his name and be- havior fitting.\" 199 \"Be hospitable to your children and raise them to be well-be- haved ...\" 200 As in all subjects, the Prophet Muhammad (saas) was an excellent model to the faithful as far as taking an interest in children and showing them love and affection.

These verses were revealed in 620 A.D., some seven years after a crushing defeat inflicted on the Byzantines by the idolater Persians. The news is reported that the Byzantines will soon again be victorious. At that time, however, the Byzantines had been so seriously defeated that it looked impossible for them even to survive, let alone later emerge victo- rious. Not only the Persians, but also the Avars, Slavs and Lombards all constituted a grave menace to the Byzantine Empire. The Avars had come as far as the walls of Constantinople. In order to meet the expenses of his army, the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius had ordered all gold and silver ornamental goods in the churches to be melted down. When that proved to be insufficient, he even started to have bronze statues torn down to make coins from. Many governors rebelled against Emperor Heraclius, and the empire was on the point of falling apart.

Y et, at just that moment, the news was revealed in the verse that Byzantium would emerge victorious again within nine years. Such a vic- tory looked so totally impossible that Arab idolaters believed that this victory, revealed in the Qur'an, could never happen. Y et, it was certainly true, just like everything else in the Qur'an. About seven years after the revelation of the first verses of Surat ar-Rum, in December 627 A.D., there was a major battle between Byzantium and the Persian Empire not far from the ruins of Nineveh. The Byzantine army defeated the Persians. A few months later, the Persians had to sign a treaty handing back to Byzantium all of its territories they had occu- pied. 209 The \"victory of the Romans,\" revealed to the Prophet (saas) by Allah in the Qur'an, had miraculously come about. Another miracle in these verses consists in the reporting of facts about a part of the world that nobody at the time could possibly identify. In verse 3 of Surat ar-Rum, it is said that the Romans had been de- feated in \"the lowest place on Earth.\" The Arabic for that is \" Adna al Ard ,\" and is translated in some texts as meaning \"a land nearby.\" Yet, that does not accurately reflect the original meaning. The Arabic word \" adna \" means \"the lowest,\" and comes from the word \" deni ,\" which means \"low.\" \" Ard \" means the \"earth.\" \" Adna al Ard \" therefore means the lowest place on earth. The battle between the Byzantine Empire and the Persians really did take place at the lowest point on earth. That was the basin of Lake Lut, where present-day Syria, Palestine and Jordan meet. It is also known that the area around the lake is 395 metres below sea-level, making it the lowest point on earth. As the verse reveals, the Romans were defeated at \"the lowest place on earth.\" The important point here is that the altitude of Lake Lut has only been been established by measurements taken in the modern age. Before that, it was not possible for anyone to know that the lake was the lowest point on earth. Yet the region is described as such in the Qur'an. That is one of the proofs that the Qur'an is the divine word, and that the Prophet Muhammad (saas) is the prophet of Allah.

That is a great miracle. The Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) is in Mecca, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. The Prophet (saas) was in Mecca when this happened. Under the condi- tions of that time it would have been quite impossible for him to go from Mecca to Jerusalem in one night. We must also make it clear that the Prophet (saas) had never before seen Jerusalem and the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The next day, when he recounted this great miracle to those around him, the polytheists in Mecca refused to believe him, and, it is said, de- manded proof. One of them had seen the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and they asked the Prophet (saas) to describe it and asked him questions about it. When the Prophet (saas) was able to describe the Al-Aqsa Mosque correctly, the polytheists said his description was exact. They then asked him whether or not he had met a caravan that was coming from there. The Prophet (saas) replied: \"Yes, I came across it. It was at Rawha. They had lost a camel and were looking for it. There was a water goblet among what they were carrying. I was thirsty and drank from it, and then put it back in its place. When they arrive, ask them if they found the water in that goblet.\" The Quraish then said, \"That is another sign.\" They then continued to ask him detailed questions about the caravan. The Prophet (saas) answered all their ques- tions, and said: \"They will arrive on such and such a day, at dawn, led by such What the Prophet (saas) Said of the Future 211 G G l l o o r r y y b b e e t t o o H H i i m m w w h h o o t t o o o o k k H H i i s s s s e e r r v v a a n n t t o o n n a a j j o o u u r r n n e e y y b b y y n n i i g g h h t t f f r r o o m m t t h h e e M M a a s s j j i i d d a a l l - - H H a a r r a a m m t t o o t t h h e e M M a a s s j j i i d d a a l l - - A A q q s s a a , , w w h h o o s s e e s s u u r r r r o o u u n n d d i i n n g g s s W W e e h h a a v v e e b b l l e e s s s s e e d d , , i i n n o o r r d d e e r r t t o o s s h h o o w w h h i i m m s s o o m m e e o o f f O O u u r r S S i i g g n n s s . .

The caravan in question indeed came into view at dawn. Leading the caravan was that same grey camel that the Prophet (saas) had described. 210 It is an important miracle that Allah should have shown the Prophet (saas) somewhere he had never been without actually going there. It was impossible at that time to go from Mecca to Jerusalem in a single night, and that makes the miracle even greater and clearer. The Prophet (saas) had a dream when he was in Medina, that the believers had entered the Sacred Mosque and walked around the Kaaba. He gave the good news to the believers. Those of the believers who mi- grated from Mecca to Medina had not been able to return since. When the Prophet (saas) spoke of his dream, as the account has it, the believers went to Mecca for the purposes of pilgrimage, although the idolators would not allow them in. The unbelievers saw this as an opportunity to sow discord, and tried to prove the Prophet (saas)'s dream false by saying that they had been unable to go to the Kaaba and unable to cut their hair. Allah revealed verse 27 of Surat al-Fath to the Prophet (saas) to help and support him, and revealed that the dream was true, and What the Prophet (saas) Said of the Future 213 A A l l l l a a h h h h a a s s c c o o n n f f i i r r m m e e d d H H i i s s M M e e s s s s e e n n g g e e r r ' ' s s v v i i s s i i o o n n w w i i t t h h t t r r u u t t h h : : Y Y o o u u w w i i l l l l e e n n t t e e r r t t h h e e M M a a s s j j i i d d a a l l - - H H a a r r a a m m i i n n s s a a f f e e t t y y , , A A l l l l a a h h w w i i l l l l i i n n g g , , s s h h a a v v i i n n g g y y o o u u r r h h e e a a d d s s a a n n d d c c u u t t t t i i n n g g y y o o u u r r h h a a i i r r w w i i t t h h o o u u t t a a n n y y f f e e a a r r . .

That led those who harboured doubts in their hearts to doubt the words of the Prophet (saas). Yet, the Prophet (saas) trusted in Allah, took no notice of what people might say, had complete faith in what Allah had revealed to him and told people about it.

Following the first of these, and their \"reaching to a degree of great haughtiness,\" Allah then sent a powerful army against them. Indeed, when the Jews killed the Prophet Yahya (as) and set a trap to kill the Prophet 'Isa (as), in other words, after their \"reaching to a degree of great haughtiness,\" they were exiled shortly afterwards from Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 A.D. The Temple of Solomon in the city was com- pletely demolished. Following their exile from Palestine in 70 A.D., the Jews wandered all over the world. Since they were seen as the killers of 'Isa (as), they were generally despised in European countries, had to live under op- pressive conditions, and even most of the time had to practice their reli- gion in secret. When that verse was revealed to the Prophet (saas), the Jews were living under very difficult conditions and had no state of their own.

That is one example of the Prophet (saas) accurately knowing the unknown. The word \"kisra\" that appears in this hadith was a name that used to be used for kings of Persia. The title \"caesar\" was used for the Roman Empire. The Prophet (saas) gave the good news that the 218 O my people! You are about to conquer Egypt. Keep the welfare of the conquered people in view.

For that reason, such an event was out of the question, at the time when the Prophet (saas) delivered those tidings. However, things actually happened as the Prophet (saas) predicted they would. Iran was conquered during the time of Omar and all its goods seized. The kingdom of the Persian \"kisra\" thus came to an end. The death of \"caesar\" and the reversion of his treasuries to the Muslims came about with the capture of important Roman centers, par- ticularly during the time of the Muslim caliphs. Starting with the time of Abubakr, important centers under the dominion of \"caesar\" such as Jordan, Palestine, Damascus, Jerusalem, Syria and Egypt were con- quered.

The Prophet (saas) decided to invite the rulers to turn to Islam, and sent one of his companions, Abdullah bin Hudhaafah, to the Kisra, the Persian King, as an ambassador. The Persian Kisra, swollen with pride, r ejected the Prophet (saas)'s offer. He even sent two ambassadors of his own to the Prophet (saas), telling the Muslims to submit to him. The Prophet (saas) first invited these two ambassadors to accept Islam. Then he called them into his presence the next day to learn their decision. 218 The next day, the Prophet (saas) told the two ambassadors what Allah had revealed to him: 220 Great Allah sent many tribulations to Kisra by his son Shireveyh, who killed him in this month, on this night at this hour! 216 In the near future, my religion and its sovereignty will reach Kisra's throne. 217"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"\"Great Allah sent many tribulations to Kisra by his son Shireveyh, who killed him in this month, on this night, at this hour!\" 219 He also personally told them: \"Tell him that my religion and my empire will reach far beyond the kingdom of Kisra; and say to him from me: Enter Islam, and I will confirm you in what you have, and I will appoint you king over the people of Yemen.\" 220 The ambassadors then returned to Yemen and described what had gone on. Badhan said: \"We will see what happens next. If what he said is true, then he is the prophet whom Allah has sent.\" 221 He then turned to his men and asked what they thought of him. The ambassadors had been greatly impressed by the Prophet (saas), and said: \"We never saw a ruler more majestic, more fearless and less guarded than him. He walked humbly amongst the people.\" Badhan waited for a while to see whether the Prophet (saas)'s words about the ruler would come true or not. In that way, he said, he could be sure that Muhammad (saas) was Allah's messenger. A short while later, a letter reached Badhan from the ruler's son, Shireveyh: \"I killed Kisra. When this letter reaches you, take the oath of the people in my name. Regarding what Kisra wrote to you, wait and do nothing until a new command from me.\" 222 When Badhan and his men worked it out, they realized that all this had happened just as the Prophet (saas) had said it would. 223 Badhan came to believe after that great miracle, and accepted Islam. He was fol- lowed by the Yemeni Abna. 224 Badhan became the first governor ap- pointed by the Prophet (saas), and the first Persian governor to be a Muslim. 225 It is a historically documented fact that in 628 the Prophet (saas) sent a letter of invitation to the Persian King Kisra, and that he was killed by his son that same year. 226 What the Prophet (saas) Said of the Future 221"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The Prophet Muhammad (saas) T T h h e e P P r r o o p p h h e e t t ( ( s s a a a a s s ) ) ' ' s s h h a a d d i i t t h h s s r r e e g g a a r r d d i i n n g g t t h h e e s s i i g g n n s s o o f f t t h h e e e e n n d d t t i i m m e e s s Many details of what the Prophet (saas) said would happen before the last days have reached us.

Once materialism is invalidated, all other theories based on this philosophy are rendered baseless. Foremost of them is Darwinism, that is, the theory of evolution. This theory, which argues that life originated from inanimate matter through coincidences, has been demolished with the recognition that the universe was created by Allah. American astrophysicist Hugh Ross explains this as follows: Atheism, Darwinism, and virtually all the \"isms\" emanating from the eigh- teenth to the twentieth century philosophies are built upon the assumption, the incorrect assumption, that the universe is infinite. The singularity has brought us face to face with the cause—or causer—beyond/behind/before the universe and all that it contains, including life itself. 268 It is Allah Who created the universe and Who designed it down to its smallest detail.

This extraordinary design in life invalidated Darwinism at the end of the 20th century. We have dealt with this subject in great detail in some of our other studies, and shall continue to do so.

The most important development that made the theory the top topic of the world of science was the book by Charles Darwin titled The Origin of Species published in 1859. In this book, Darwin denied that different living species on the earth were created separately by Allah. According to Darwin, all living beings had a common ancestor and they diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an \"assump- tion.\" Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book ti- tled \"Difficulties of the Theory,\" the theory was failing in the face of many critical questions. Darwin invested all his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve the \"Difficulties of the Theory.\" However, contrary to his expectations, scien- tific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism against science can be reviewed under three basic topics: 1) The theory can by no means ex- plain how life originated on the earth. The Prophet Muhammad (saas) 262 Charles Darwin"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"2) There is no scientific finding showing that the \"evolutionary mechanisms\" proposed by the theory have any power to evolve at all. 3) The fossil record proves completely the contrary of the sugges- tions of the theory of evolution.

How a single cell could generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be ob- served in the fossil record are some of the questions the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, of the first step of the alleged evo- lutionary process it has to be inquired: How did this \"first cell\" originate? Since the theory of evolution denies creation and does not accept any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the \"first cell\" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan, or arrangement. According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. This, however, is a claim inconsistent with even the most unassailable rules of biology. \" \" L L i i f f e e C C o o m m e e s s f f r r o o m m L L i i f f e e \" \" In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, the theory asserting that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly be- lieved that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while.

Even in the period when Darwin wrote The Origin of Species, the belief that bacteria could come into existence from non-living matter was widely accepted in the world of science. However, five years after the publication of Darwin's book, Louis Pasteur announced his re- sults after long studies and experiments, which disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin's theory. In his triumphal lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, Pasteur said, \"Never will the doctrine of sponta- neous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple ex- periment.\" 269 Advocates of the theory of evolution resisted the findings of Pasteur for a long time. However, as the development of science unrav- eled the complex structure of the cell of a living being, the idea that life could come into being coincidentally faced an even greater impasse.

W ith various theses he advanced in the 1930's, he tried to prove that the cell of a living being could originate by coincidence. These studies, how- ever, were doomed to failure, and Oparin had to make the following con- fession: \"Unfortunately, however, the problem of the origin of the cell is perhaps the most obscure point in the whole study of the evolution of or- ganisms.\" 270 Evolutionist followers of Oparin tried to carry out experiments to solve the problem of the origin of life.

The cell of a living being is more complex than all of the technological products produced by man. Today, even in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be pro- duced by bringing inorganic materials together. The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quan- tity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability of proteins, the building blocks of cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10950 for an av- erage protein made up of 500 amino acids. In mathematics, a probability small- er than 1 over 1050 is practically considered to be impossible. The DNA molecule, which is located in the nucleus of the cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. It is calculated that if the information coded in DNA were written down, this would make a giant library consisting of 900 volumes of encyclopaedias of 500 pages each. A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: the DNA can only r eplicate with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can only be realized by the information coded in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute from the University of San Diego, California, confesses this fact in the September 1994 issue of the Scientific American magazine: It is extremely improbable that proteins and nucleic acids, both of which are struc- turally complex, arose spontaneously in the same place at the same time. Yet it al- so seems impossible to have one without the other. And so, at first glance, one might have to conclude that life could never, in fact, have originated by chemical means. 274"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"267 No doubt, if it is impossible for life to have originated from natural causes, then it has to be accepted that life was \"created\" in a supernatural way. This fact explicitly invalidates the theory of evolution, whose main purpose is to deny creation.

Darwin based his evolution allegation entirely on the mechanism of \"natural selection\". The importance he placed on this mechanism was evident in the name of his book: The Origin of Species, By Means Of Natural Selection... Natural selection holds that those living things that are stronger and more suited to the natural conditions of their habitats will survive in the strug- gle for life. For example, in a deer herd under the threat of attack by wild ani- mals, those that can run faster will survive. Therefore, the deer herd will be comprised of faster and stronger individuals. However, unquestionably, this mechanism will not cause deer to evolve and transform themselves into an- other living species, for instance, horses. Therefore, the mechanism of natural selection has no evolutionary power. Darwin was also aware of this fact and had to state this in his book The Origin of Species: All information about living beings is stored in the DNA molecule. This incredibly effi- cient information storage method alone is a clear evidence that life did not come into being by chance, but has been purposely de- signed, or, better to say, marvellously created."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual differences or varia- tions occur. 275 L L a a m m a a r r c c k k ' ' s s I I m m p p a a c c t t So, how could these \"favourable variations\" occur? Darwin tried to an- swer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of sci- ence in his age. According to the French biologist Lamarck, who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their life- time to the next generation and these traits, accumulating from one genera- tion to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, according to Lamarck, giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. Darwin also gave similar examples, and in his book The Origin of Species, for instance, said that some bears going into water to find food trans- formed themselves into whales over time. 276 However, the laws of inheritance discovered by Mendel and verified by the science of genetics that flourished in the 20th century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fell out of favour as an evolutionary mechanism. N N e e o o - - D D a a r r w w i i n n i i s s m m a a n n d d M M u u t t a a t t i i o o n n s s In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the \"Modern Synthetic Theory\", or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings because of external factors such as radiation or replication errors, as the \"cause of favourable variations\" in addition to natural mutation. T oday, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo- Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings present on the earth formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms such as the ears, eyes, lungs, and wings, underwent \"muta- tions,\" that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that to- tally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to de- velop; on the contrary, they always cause harm to them. The Prophet Muhammad (saas) 268"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"The reason for this is very simple: the DNA has a very complex struc- ture and random effects can only cause harm to it. American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows: First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the build- ing which, in all probability, would not be an improvement. 277 Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All muta- tions have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented as an \"evolutionary mechanism,\" is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living beings, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer). No doubt, a destructive mechanism cannot be an \"evolutionary mechanism.\" Natural selection, on the other hand, \"can do nothing by itself\" as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no \"evolutionary mechanism\" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, neither could any imaginary process called evolution have taken place.

According to the theory of evolution, every living species has sprung from a predecessor. A previously existing species turned into something else in time and all species have come into being in this way. According to the the- ory, this transformation proceeds gradually over millions of years. Had this been the case, then numerous intermediary species should have existed and lived within this long transformation period. For instance, some half-fish/half-reptiles should have lived in the past which had acquired some reptilian traits in addition to the fish traits they already had. Or there should have existed some reptile-birds, which ac- quired some bird traits in addition to the reptilian traits they already The Evolution Deception 269"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"270 100-150-mil- lion-year-old fossil shrimp from the L.Cretaceous Period.

Evolutionists refer to these imaginary crea- tures, which they believe to have lived in the past, as \"transitional forms.\" If such animals had really existed, there should be millions and even billions of them in number and variety. More importantly, the remains of these strange creatures should be present in the fossil record. In The Origin of Species, Darwin explained: If my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all of the species of the same group together must assuredly have existed... Consequently, evidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil remains. 278 D D a a r r w w i i n n ' ' s s H H o o p p e e s s S S h h a a t t t t e e r r e e d d However, although evolutionists have been making strenuous efforts to find fossils since the middle of the 19th century all over the world, no tran- sitional forms have yet been uncovered. All the fossils unearthed in excava- tions showed that, contrary to the expectations of evolutionists, life appeared on earth all of a sudden and fully-formed. A famous British paleontologist, Derek V. Ager, admits this fact, even though he is an evolutionist: The point emerges that if we examine the fossil rec,ord in detail, whether at the level of orders or of species, we find - over and over again - not gradual evolution, but the sudden explosion of one group at the expense of another. 279 This means that in the fossil record, all living species suddenly emerge as fully formed, without any intermediate forms in between. This is just the opposite of Darwin's assumptions. Also, it is very strong evidence that living beings are created. The only explanation of a living species emerging sud- denly and complete in every detail without any evolutionary ancestor can be that this species was created. This fact is admitted also by the widely known evolutionist biologist Douglas Futuyma: Creation and evolution, between them, exhaust the possible explanations for the origin of living things. Organisms either appeared on the earth fully developed or they did not. If they did not, they must have developed from pre-existing species by some process of modification. If they did appear in a fully developed state, they must indeed have been created by some omnipotent intelligence. 280 Fossils show that living beings emerged fully developed and The Evolution Deception 271"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"in a perfect state on the earth.

The Darwinist claim holds that the modern men of today evolved from some kind of ape-like crea- tures. During this alleged evolutionary process, which is supposed to have started 4-5 million years ago, it is claimed that there existed some \"transi- tional forms\" between modern man and his ancestors. According to this completely imaginary scenario, four basic \"categories\" are listed: The Prophet Muhammad (saas) 272 The theory of evolu- tion claims that living species gradually evolved from one an- other. The fossil record, however, ex- plicitly falsifies this claim. For example, in the Cambrian Period, some 550 million years ago, tens of totally dis- tinct living species emerged suddenly. These living beings depicted in the above picture have very com- plex structures. This fact, referred to as the \"Cambrian Explosion\" in scientific literature is plain evidence of creation."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"1. Australopithecus 2. Homo habilis 3. Homo erectus 4. Homo sapiens Evolutionists call the so-called first ape-like ancestors of men \"Australopithecus\" which means \"South African ape.\" These living be- ings are actually nothing but an old ape species that has become extinct. Extensive research done on various Australopithecus specimens by two world famous anatomists from England and the USA, namely, Lord Solly Zuckerman and Prof. Charles Oxnard, has shown that these belonged to an ordinary ape species that became extinct and bore no resemblance to humans. 281 Evolutionists classify the next stage of human evolution as \"homo,\" that is \"man.\" According to the evolutionist claim, the living beings in the Homo series are more developed than Australopithecus. Evolutionists devise a fanciful evolution scheme by arranging different fossils of these creatures in a particular order. This scheme is imaginary because it has never been proved that there is an evolutionary relation between these different classes. Ernst Mayr, one of the most important proponents of the theory of evolution in the 20th century, contends in his book One Long Argument that \"particularly historical [puzzles] such as the origin of life or of Homo sapiens, are extremely difficult and may even resist a final, satisfying explanation.\" 282 By outlining the link chain as \"Australopithecus > Homo habilis > Homo erectus > Homo sapiens,\" evolutionists imply that each of these species is one another's ancestor. However, recent findings of paleoan- thropologists have revealed that Australopithecus, Homo habilis and Homo erectus lived at different parts of the world at the same time. 283 Moreover, a certain segment of humans classified as Homo erectus have lived up until very modern times. Homo sapiens neandarthalensis and Homo sapiens sapiens (modern man) co-existed in the same re- gion. 284 This situation apparently indicates the invalidity of the claim that they are ancestors of one another.

Lord Solly Zuckerman, one of the most famous and respected sci- entists in the U.K., who carried out research on this subject for years, and particularly studied Australopithecus fossils for 15 years, finally con- cluded, despite being an evolutionist himself, that there is, in fact, no such family tree branching out from ape-like creatures to man. Zuckerman also made an interesting \"spectrum of science.\" He formed a spectrum of sciences ranging from those he considered scien- tific to those he considered unscientific. According to Zuckerman's spec- trum, the most \"scientific\"—that is, depending on concrete data—fields of science are chemistry and physics. After them come the biological sci- ences and then the social sciences. At the far end of the spectrum, which is the part considered to be most \"unscientific,\" are \"extra-sensory per- ception\"—concepts such as telepathy and sixth sense–and finally \"hu- man evolution.\" Zuckerman explains his reasoning: The Prophet Muhammad (saas) 274 The most important element of the propaganda campaign evolutionists conduct by means of the media is the way the utterly fictitious he- roes of their accounts are depicted as ape-like crea- tures.

T T e e c c h h n n o o l l o o g g y y I I n n T T h h e e E E y y e e a a n n d d T T h h e e E E a a r r Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of \"how we see\". Light rays coming from an object fall oppo- sitely on the retina of the eye. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and they reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain called the centre of vision. These electric signals are perceived in this cen- tre of the brain as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking. The brain is insulated from light. That means that the inside of the brain is solid dark, and light does not reach the location where the brain is situated. The place called the centre of vision is a solid dark place where no light ever reaches; it may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness. The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the 20th century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you read, your hands with which you hold it, then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you.

For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharp- The Evolution Deception 275"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"ness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective having depth. For many years, ten of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV, and reach the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system but it is not possible to watch it without putting on glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground ap- pears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the televi- sion, there is a loss of image quality. Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what The Prophet Muhammad (saas) 276"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"thousands of people cannot? If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear; the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them; the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalises in the centre of hearing in the brain. The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just like it is from light: it does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your brain, which is insulated from sound, you listen to the symphonies of an orchestra, and hear all the noises in a crowded place. However, if the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise de- vice at that moment, it would be seen that a complete silence is prevail- ing there. As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all this technology and the thou- sands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeav- our, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality HI- FI systems produced by the biggest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a HI-FI you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the technology of the hu- man body are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does HI- FI; it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear.

Who is it that watches an alluring world in its brain, listens to sym- phonies and the twittering of birds, and smells the rose? The stimulations coming from the eyes, ears, and nose of a human being travel to the brain as electro-chemical nervous impulses. In biolo- gy, physiology, and biochemistry books, you can find many details about how this image forms in the brain. However, you will never come across the most important fact about this subject: Who is it that perceives these electro-chemical nervous impulses as images, sounds, odours and sen- sory events in the brain? There is a consciousness in the brain that per- ceives all this without feeling any need for eye, ear, and nose. To whom does this consciousness belong?

Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. Aw ell known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is \"first and fore- most a materialist and then a scientist\": It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us ac- cept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an appara- tus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absolute, so we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door. 287 These are explicit statements that Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to the materialist philosophy. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it argues that inanimate, unconscious matter created life. It insists that millions of dif- ferent living species; for instance, birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whales and human beings originated as a result of the in- teractions between matter such as the pouring rain, the lightning flash, etc., out of inanimate matter. This is a precept contrary both to reason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so as \"not to allow a Divine Foot in the door.\" Anyone who does not look at the origin of living beings with a ma- terialist prejudice will see this evident truth: All living beings are works of a Creator, Who is All-Powerful, All-Wise and All-Knowing.

Some of these verses are as follows: A A s s f f o o r r t t h h o o s s e e w w h h o o d d i i s s b b e e l l i i e e v v e e , , i i t t m m a a k k e e s s n n o o d d i i f f f f e e r r e e n n c c e e t t o o t t h h e e m m w w h h e e t t h h e e r r y y o o u u w w a a r r n n t t h h e e m m o o r r d d o o n n o o t t w w a a r r n n t t h h e e m m , , t t h h e e y y w w i i l l l l n n o o t t b b e e - - l l i i e e v v e e . .

It is understandable that one or a few people might believe in impossible scenarios and claims full of stu- pidity and illogicality. However, \"magic\" is the only possible explanation for people from all over the world believing that unconscious and lifeless atoms suddenly decided to come together and form a universe that func- tions with a flawless system of organization, discipline, reason and con- sciousness, the planet Earth with all its features so perfectly suited to life, and living things full of countless complex systems. In fact, Allah reveals in the Qur'an in the incident of the Prophet Musa and Pharaoh that some people who support atheistic philosophies actually influence others by magic. When Pharaoh was told about the true religion, he told the Prophet Musa to meet with his own magicians. When the Prophet Musa did so, he told them to demonstrate their abili- ties first. The verses continue: H H e e s s a a i i d d , , \" \" Y Y o o u u t t h h r r o o w w . . \" \" A A n n d d w w h h e e n n t t h h e e y y t t h h r r e e w w , , t t h h e e y y c c a a s s t t a a s s p p e e l l l l o o n n t t h h e e p p e e o o p p l l e e ' ' s s e e y y e e s s a a n n d d c c a a u u s s e e d d t t h h e e m m t t o o f f e e e e l l g g r r e e a a t t f f e e a a r r o o f f t t h h e e m m . .

( ( S S u u r r a a t t a a l l - - A A ' ' r r a a f f : : 1 1 1 1 6 6 ) ) As we have seen, Pharaoh's magicians were able to deceive every- one, apart from the Prophet Musa and those who believed in him. However, the evidence put forward by the Prophet Musa broke that spell, or \"swallowed up what they had forged\" as the verse puts it. W W e e r r e e v v e e a a l l e e d d t t o o M M u u s s a a , , \" \" T T h h r r o o w w d d o o w w n n y y o o u u r r s s t t a a f f f f . . \" \" A A n n d d i i t t i i m m - - m m e e d d i i a a t t e e l l y y s s w w a a l l l l o o w w e e d d u u p p w w h h a a t t t t h h e e y y h h a a d d f f o o r r g g e e d d . .

( ( S S u u r r a a t t a a l l - - A A ' ' r r a a f f : : 1 1 1 1 7 7 - - 1 1 1 1 9 9 ) ) As we can see from that verse, when it was realized that what these people who had first cast a spell over others had done was just an illu- The Prophet Muhammad (saas) 282"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"sion, they lost all credibility. In the present day too, unless those who un- der the influence of a similar spell believe in these ridiculous claims un- der their scientific disguise and spend their lives defending them aban- don them, they too will be humiliated when the full truth emerges and the spell is broken. In fact, Malcolm Muggeridge, an atheist philosopher and supporter of evolution admitted he was worried by just that prospect: I myself am convinced that the theory of evolution, especially the extent to which it's been applied, will be one of the great jokes in the history books in the future. Posterity will marvel that so very flimsy and dubious an hypothesis could be accepted with the incredible credulity that it has. 288 That future is not far off: On the contrary, people will soon see that \"chance\" is not a god, and will look back on the theory of evolution as the worst deceit and the most terrible spell in the world. That spell is already rapidly beginning to be lifted from the shoulders of people all over the world. Many people who see the true face of the theory of evolution are wondering with amazement how it was that they were ever taken in by it.
