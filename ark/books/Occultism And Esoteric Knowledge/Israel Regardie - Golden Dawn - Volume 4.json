Alsoseveralpieces of oral instruction are here included. I havekept rigidly to thetechnique as taught and practisedin the Order—I.R.)“The subject of clairvoyance must always be in thehighest degree interesting toall who are aspiring afterAdeptship even in its lowest grades . . . Wefrequentlymeet with two opposite attitudes towards the subject,both in the outerworld and amongst our juniormembers. Both these attitudes are hindrances toitsproper study, and therefore I shall preface my remarksby a few wordsconcerning each of them.“The first is fear of clairvoyance. And the second is adisproportionate estimateof its value.“Both of these attitudes arise from a misunderstand-ing of its true character.People imagine that somehowthe power of clairvoyance is obtained secondhandfromthe powers of evil; or that its exercise will bring thosewho practice itunder their influence. Or, on the otherhand, they imagine that the power ofclairvoyance willsave them a great deal of trouble, and give them ashort andeasy path to the information and guidancethey desire. In fact, that these mayalmost be attainedat will. Nay more, would such a power not fullysatisfy thatcuriosity which is one of the pitfalls of thesuperficial student?“The properly trained clairvoyant need have no fearthat he will thereby exposehimself to the powers ofevil. It is the untrained natural clairvoyant who isindanger. Training will give him knowledge, discipline<n>and protection, such as will protect him from theonslaught of the averse powers.“On the other hand, let him who desires to savehimself trouble and to gainknowledge to which he hasno claim, be very well assured that only ‘in thesweatof his brow’ can he obtain this power and exercise itin security. And thathe who seeks to gratify hiscuriosity will either be mortified by disappointmentordistressed by discoveries he would much prefer not tohave made. Trained,humble, and reverent clairvoy-ance is a great gift, opening up new worlds anddeepertruths, lifting us out of ourselves into the great in-pouring andoutpouring of the heart of God.” (G. H.Fratre F.R.’s notes.)The earliest experiments in clairvoyance as taught bythe Order are with theTattwa symbols. These, withtheir traditional names, significances, symbolsandcolours are:Akasa—Ether or Spirit.Vayu—Air.Tejas—Fire.Apas—Water.Prithivi—Earth.Symbol: black or indigoegg-Symbol: a sky-blue discor circle.Symbol: Red equilateraltriangle.Symbol: a silver crescent.Symbol: a yellow squareor cube.In brief, the traditional occult concept of the Tattwais that of a vital currentof ether or force—the HinduPranas—W'hich issues in a steady stream from theSun.That stream is five-fold, and flows around our earth,vitalising its astralsubstance or its sphere of Sensation.In short, they are the currents orsub-planes of theAstral Light. The theory has it that the Element ofAkasa isstrongest at dawn, when the Sun rises, andits power continues for the space oftwo hours, whenits force subsides and glides into Vayu, Air. This alsopersistsor is in course for the same period. Each Tattwa< I2>Picture #1 [images/img_0001.bmp]Picture #2 [images/img_0002.bmp]or current of force is believed to exist strongly for thislength of time, eachmerging at the end into the suc-ceeding Tattwa in the order given above. Afterthecurrent of Prithivi is exhausted, the cycle recommenceswith Akasa, andcontinues in the same order againand for the same periods.As no element on our plane can exist in an unmixed<i3>Picture #3 [images/img_0003.bmp]form, but contains within itself the constituents of allthe others, or possessesseveral grades or planes of itsown substance, so each Tattwa is subdivided intofivedivisions, currents or planes. Akasa of Akasa, Spirit ofSpirit, would be themost tenuous and purest form ofthat element, the integral nature of Spirit—itshighestessence. Vayu of Akasa would refer to its airy quality;Tejas of Akasa toits fiery and dynamic aspect; Apasof Akasa, its fluidic and watery phase, whilePrithiviof Akasa, its most terrestrial phase, or that aspect ofits power whichmore nearly than the others contactsthe earth. The same five-fold division, inthe samefive-fold order, applies equally to the other elements.The student is strongly urged to make these symbols,and have a set of them withhim for working. Theprimary or simple Tattwa should be made about twoor two anda half inches in height. It is recommendedthat coloured papers be used ratherthan water colours,since the brilliance of the former is much greater thanthelatter. The lacquer paints which are now easilyobtainable may also be used togood effect. If thesymbols are cut from coloured papers, they shouldbe pasted onclean unused cards length upwards. Themethod of indicating a sub-Tattwa, or acharged orcompound Tattwa, is to paint or paste upon the princi-pal S3unbol asmaller symbol of the charge or sub-element. Thus, in the case of Tejas ofPrithivi, Fire ofEarth, Prithivi which is the major symbol should bemade abouttwo and a half inches square, whilst thered triangle, each angle about half aninch long, shouldbe pasted in the centre of the larger symbol. It is ausefulpreliminary also to write on the back of thecard the appropriate Divine andAngelic Names.The method of using these Tattwa symbols forclairvoyance is a simple one. Myremarks in the follow-ing example will refer to the element of Prithivi,Earth,the yellow square, and what is said of this will applyequally well to theremaining symbols. Though the< 14 >method is simple, it is far from fool-proof, and thedescription of it should beread several times.The student should be calm and quiet, and, sittingin his chair, take the cardbearing the symbol of theyellow square in his hand, and gaze intently at itforabout twenty seconds. Quickly transferring his atten-tion from the symbol toany white surface, such as theceiling, or a sheet of paper at his sideespecially pro-vided for the purpose, he will see, by reflex opticalaction, thesame shape but in a direct complementarycolour. This will be a sort of luminouslavender-blue,or pale translucent mauve. The actual tint of thiscomplementarycolour will depend wholly on the depthof the yellow used in the first place, aswell as uponthe lighting conditions prevailing at the time of theexperiment.Immediately this mauve square is seen, the studentshould close his eyes, andendeavour to visualize inimagination this mauve square as standing beforehim.This clearly perceived by the mind’s eye, let the studentat once imaginethat it enlarges itself, becoming anobject large enough for him to pass through.The nextstep is to imagine that he is actually passing throughthis square, asthough it were a door. The best methodof doing this is to employ the Neophytesign, the Signof the Enterer, which is that of “groping for light.” Itisessentially a projecting sign, and the effect should beof having projectedhimself through this door or gate-way. It is recommended that the student riseto hisfeet at this juncture and, still visualizing the enlargedsquare withclosed eyes of course, perform this Signof Homs physically, and believinghimself through it,sit down ready to commence the vision.One of the other instructions puts it thus: “Firstmeditate on the elementselected, soak yourself in ittill, if it be Fire, you feel hot; if Water, wet,and so on,all the time co-ordinating the symbol with your sensa-tions. Then,laying aside the symbol, and closing youreyes, endeavour to project and enlargethat symbol<i5>before you, regarding it as a gateway through whichyou are to pass . . .Deliberately will to pass throughthe gateway. Let him imagine that he can hearit closebehind him.”Yet another version, this time written by D.D.C.F.says: “Keep up the design,form and colour in theAkasic Aura, as clearly as they appeared in materialformto the outward seeing. Transfer the vital effortfrom the optic nerve to themental perception, orthought-seeing as distinct from the seeing with theeye. Letone form of apprehension glide on into theother. Produce the reality of thedream vision bypositive will in the waking state . . . Then maintainingyourabstraction from your surroundings, still concen-trated upon the symbol and itscorrelated ideas, youare to seek a perception of a scene or panorama or viewofthe plane. This may also be brought on by a senseof tearing open, as a curtainis drawn aside, and seeingthe ‘within’ of the symbol before you.”The principal idea is to imagine the symbol, in itscomplementary colour, as adoor and to pass throughit. Having imagined that there has been a passingthroughthe door, and clearly realising, in this instance,the mauve Square behind him,the seer should makean effort to look about him. Let him endeavour toseeobjects, entities, or some sort of landscape. Most alwaysthese take the formof pale stilled pictures, seen as itwere with the mind, or the eye ofimagination. Hillocks,meadows, rocks, vast brown boulders may be seen, andwhatis most important, there should be a strong senseof being within the element;the seer should under-stand, as he has never quite realised before, thetruenature, the ‘feel’ of Earth.Before aught else occurs, the Divine Names appropri-ate to that element shouldnow be vibrated, beginningwith the Deity Name. The student should vibrateeachslowly and audibly several times. Thus, he wouldvibrate Adonai ha-Aretz,three or four times, then thename of Auriel the Archangel of Earth, followed bythe< i6>name of Phorlakh the Angel of Earth, These willusually suffice though the Hebrewname of the elementand cardinal quarter may also be employed. Variouschanges maynow be perceived to occur to the land-scape; it will become alive, vivified anddynamic, andthe sense of the element should become even moreclearly and vividlydefined. Also a being may appear,one whose characteristics pertain to theelement ofEarth, and his garments, their colours, and his otherornaments shouldbe in the appropriate colours. Underno circumstances should the Seer wander fromhisdoorway alone; he should always wait until one of theseelemental beings or“guides” appears, and he shouldcontinue vibrating the names until one doesappear, oruntil he obtains the sense that one is present. Some-times, and withsome students, there is no clear visionof these occurrences or beings, but onlya sense orintuition or powerful instinct that such and such athing is happening,and that such a type of being hasappeared. This often is more trustworthy thanthe useof sight or other sense.The guide having made his appearance, he is to betested by every means at theSeer’s disposal. First ofall, it is well to assume the Sign of the Grade towhichthat element is referred. In this instance, the Sign ofthe Zelator shouldbe made, by physically as well asastrally raising the right arm to an angle offorty-fivedegrees. The guide should answer this wi.th the sameSign or anotherwhich is unmistakeable proof that hebelongs to the element and has been sent toact asguide. If there is deception, these signs will cause himdistress, or atonce the vision will break up, or the falseguide will disappear. He should alsobe asked clearlyand deliberately whether he comes to act as guide inthe name ofthe appropriate Deity Name. If all thisstrikes the Seer as satisfactory, and hisdoubts settled,let him follow the guide to wherever he is being led,carefullynoting whither he goes, and asking questionsabout the element or whatever hesees.<i7>A very important thing is here to be noted. On thesesubtler planes, or withinthe realms of these symbols,form takes on symbolic implication which we, onearth,have obscured if not lost. It is only human beings whoswathe themselves ingarments whose shape and colourbear no relation to their true character. “Evenon ourown plane, the clothing of animals is pregnant withmeaning, and on theastral plane this is far moreemphatically the case. An elemental may, forsomepurpose of its own, masquerade for a time in alien garb,but we are given acertain definite procedure to followin dealing with them.”The Signs of the elemental Grades, the vibration ofdivine and angelic names, andthe tracing of appro-priate pentagrams are symbols which powerfully affecttheseelemental inhabitants of the astral, and preventor disclose deception. It is butrarely that there willbe necessity to resort to anything so drastic asthePentagrams in these tattwa visions, for the vibrationof the Hebrew nameeither of the element, or of theArchangel will restore order and harmony. Thetrueform, colour, clothing, even adornments such as jewelsand embroideries areconsonant to the element andcharacter of the beings under discussion. Andunlessthey are, the Seer may be sure he is being imposed on,and should actaccordingly—at once. In a short while,after only a few astral experiences, thesesymbolic ideaswill have been sufficiently familiar to the student toenable himat once to detect error or imposition.In the event of employing a charged or compoundTattwa such as let us assume,Fire of Earth, indicatedby a Red Triangle within a larger Yellow square, itmayhappen that the seer may find himself beingescorted from one guide to another,and passed fromone plane to another. The same test should be applied,and not theslightest loophole should be left for theentry of even the smallest incongruousitem. The divinenames of the secondary Tattwa should be vibrated,and the gradeSign attributed to it should be assumed.< i8>Only when fully satisfied, and he must never permithimself to be easilysatisfied, should the Seer proceed.If the first guide be left behind, he must beaccordedcourtesy of farewell. “Always treat these beings withcourtesy and inaccord with their rank. Pay deferenceto the superior orders, the Archangels,Angels andRulers. To those of lower rank, bear yourself as anequal; and to thoselower still, as to servants whom youtreat politely, but do not allowfamiliarity. Elementalpure and simple, such as fairies, gnomes and so on, mustbetreated with firmness and decision, as they are oftenmischievous andirresponsible, even though free frommalice.” It is also said to be a goodpractice, since formis symbolic in these regions, to imagine yourself aslarge aspossible, always taller than the being con-fronting you; and under everycircumstance maintainself-control and fearless demeanour.At first, and for the first half-a-dozen experiments,the student should becontent with the simple observa-tion of the landscape and, if possible, the typeof guidewho appears in answer to the Names. At the beginningit is more importantto acquire facility in passingthrough these symbolic doors than in acquiringim-pressive visions. The Seer will find himself on the righttrack if he iscontent, for quite some little time, witha glimpse of a hill, a cave, anunderground hall, or anAngel of the Element, and so on, returning after thebriefvisit. With facility acquired, he may stay in thevision for a longer period,which should be relativelyfull of incident and action, and should impartnolittle knowledge.The method of leaving the Tattwa and returning toEarth is the precise reversalof the initial process. Afterthanking the guide and bidding him farewell, theSeershould retrace his footsteps to the symbolic Door—thepurple or lavender-bluesquare. It is insisted that thisreturn should be made as definite as possible.That is,there should be no sudden departure from the placeand finding oneselfback in one’s normal state of mind.< 19 >The Seer will be wise if he carefully follows the passagehe has walked through,even if it has been a very longway, the reason being that it is well to keep thetwostates of consciousness, the two planes, quite distinctfrom one another.There should be no merging of theelemental plane into the plane of everydayconscious-ness, and the best way of ensuring this is to make bothcoming andgoing follow a definite and distinct tech-nique. After having found your wayback to the door,you pass through it, again with the Sign of the Enterer,andreturn to your body. At once stand up, and makephysically and firmly the Sign ofSilence, raising theleft forefinger to the lips, and stamping with therightfoot. Always note that the first Sign of the Enterer isanswered andfollowed by the Sign of Silence.It is not well to repeat these experiments too fre-quently at first; some advisean interval of several daysbetween them, for the first few months of one’seffortsin this direction. But when performed, the seer shouldmake every effortto avoid self-delusion and deception.He should be alert the whole time, andnever embarkon these experiments when tired or not physically well.At the leastthreat of incoherence, or the entry ofincongruous symbols or elements into thevision, thenames, signs, and symbols should be repeated. Thusand thus alone mayhe hope to avoid delusion. Theseplanes are a source of untold danger towhosoever isnot able to take them with the proverbial grain of salt.Flattery,which is one of the most frequent types ofdelusion encountered, and the mostcommon sourceof trouble, should be avoided like the plague. Madnesslies that wayand I cannot stress too strongly thatvanity should be wholly discarded, andflatteryeschewed.During his adventures, the Seer should endeavourto describe carefully and infull detail the landscape ofthe vision. He should discover if possible thespecialattributes and nature of that plane, the type ofitsinhabitants—spiritual, elemental and so on; the plants,< 20>animals and minerals which would correspond to itsnature; the operation of itsinfluence upon Man,animals, plants and minerals here.The process of working by placing the symbol uponthe forehead, instead ofimaginatively passing throughit, is not a good practice. S.R.M.D. claims that itisliable to derange the brain-circulation and cause mentalillusions anddisturbance, headache and nervous ex-haustion. It is also necessary to avoidself-hypnotism,for this would dispose towards mediumship and makethe Seer theplayground of forces. The Seer at all costsmust control, and not permit himselfto be controlled.If in danger at any time, or should he feel that hecannotaccomodate the forces of the vision to his will,or that his self-control isbreaking, he should resort tothe vibration of the Names, and then retire fromthevision.By continuing these practices for a long period oftime, the inner clairvoyancewill develop, and withperseverance the visions will grow from vagueinde-terminate pictures, hardly distinguishable from im-aginative concepts, tovivid powerful experiences. Buteven when these do occur he should under nocircum-stances accept them on their face value or neglect histests, for thewhole astral plane, apparently, seeks todelude the Seer and if he opens himself,by neglectingthe tests, he is lost. With considerable practice, too,the symbolsmay be discarded for they will not berequired to give entrance to the planes,though for thebeginner no attempt should be made to work withoutthe use of theactual material symbol. It will be foundwisest to keep as much to the physicalplane as possible,by employing the physical symbols, and by makingtheappropriate signs and steps with the physical body,as well as by speakingaudibly and describing thevision as it proceeds.When the student has become fairly proficient withthe use of simple Tattwas, heshould experiment withthe compound Tattwas, and not be satisfied with his< 21 >ability to skry until he is perfectly familiar with everypart of the planesrepresented by those symbols. Thenhe can devise further experiments with othersymbols.The use of the element Akasa, the indigo egg, was inthe Order usuallypostponed until entry had beenobtained into the Second Order. The reason forthiswas that no traditional Names are provided for usewith this symbol as withthe other four, and the studentmust discover or devise his own. As has alreadybeendescribed at length the entrance into these subtle planesis obtained bymeans of the Divine Names; the rulebeing to invoke the highest Names known bythe Seer.Any student who has studied the Adeptus MinorCeremony, and the Ritualof the Pentagram will realisewhat Names are required for use with this symbolofAkasa. Eheieh, Agla, Yeheshuah, and Eth will be thegeneral Names for thesimple Tattwa, and the com-pound or charged Akasa cards will demand the useofthe Names from the Enochian Tablet of Union.It will be found a good plan to prepare cards of theGeomantic symbols painted intheir appropriate col-ours, for these make perfect “doors” through which theSeercan pass. And while these symbols are also at-tributed to the elements, thevision acquired from theGeomantic symbols using the names of theappropriateRulers and genii will be quite distinct in characterfrom those of theTattwa cards. The Hebrew letters,the Tarot cards and Sigils, the planetary andzodiacalSigns, and Sigils of every description may be used toyield the symbolicdoor to a subtle plane. A vast newfield of knowledge is thus opened up. Thenames appro-priate to each of these symbols are given in thesepapers, whichshould be carefully studied by thestudent. And he should remember that theformula ofthe employment of the divine Names and signs appliesequally to theseother symbols as they did to theTattwa cards.There was a good deal of glib parlance within theOrder as to “astral vision” and“etheric vision.” The< 22 >former was described as the ordinary Tattwa vision, inwhich objects andlandscapes, though vivid and alive,are yet “flat” as though reflected on amirror. Ratherlike a cinematograph film. “In this form of descrying,note thatyou see objects reversed, as to right and left,for which suitable allowance mustbe made.” The useof the phrase “mirror-like vision” is actually a veryadequatedescription. Yet this is capable, as develop-ment proceeds, of merging intoanother type of vision—a full-blooded clairvoyance, in which things andpeopleare seen in three dimensions, and as though the seerwere not merelywatching the scene, but were actuallyin it. Some explained that as “ethericvision” althoughthe actual Order documents describe this as theclairvoyanceensuing from astral projection. GreatlyHonoured Fratre D.D.C.F. states: “Ifinstead of thissimple vision a ray of yourself is sent out and actuallygoes tothe place (astral projection) there is notnecessarily the sense of reversal ofobjects . . . Scenes,things, instead of being like pictures, have thethirddimension, solidity; they stand out like bas-relief, thenhaut-relief, thenyou see as from a balloon, as it is said,by a birds-eye view. You fee! to go tothe place, todescend upon it, to step out upon the scene, and to bean actorthere.” The same rules laid down for thesimpler method of skrying should befollowed here, andalways the highest divine names should be used, andconstanttests applied. The paper which follows this,dealing with Skrying and AstralProiection by V.N.R.will explain the process a little more fully by meansofsetting forth an example of its working.Another technique, making use of this faculty, wasdescribed in a paper recordinga lecture bv Fratre SubSpe. The idea was to re-read the rituals, andthenendeavour to re-tread the Paths astrally. One examplegiven, was that theSeer should formulate in imagina-tion a vast pylon, and within its gates heshould visual-ise the Hebrew Letter Tau, the 12nd Path. This shouldbe precededby a study of the Ritual of the Theoricus< 23 >Grade, especially of the Rite of the Kerubic Stations.Then, imagining himselfpassing through this LetterTau, and entering the Pylon, he should proceed tomakethe appropriate Pentagrams and Hexagrams, and vi-brating the Divine Namesappropriate to that plane.The resulting vision should be similar to the passageofthe Path in the ceremony, but whereas this latter waspurely symbolic, theformer may be real and dynamic,and may develop into an initiation in the truesenseof the word. The same technique may be applied toevery Path and to everySephirah.Developing still further from this, there is anotherpractice which passes beyondmere clairvoyance,though making use of it. This is called Rising on thePlanes,and is a spiritual process after spiritual concep-tions and higher aims. “Byconcentration and contem-plation of the divine, you formulate a Tree ofLifepassing from you to the spiritual realms above andbeyond yourself. Pictureto yourself that you stand inMalkuth, then by the use of the Divine Namesandaspiration ,you strive upwards by the Path of Tautowards Yesod, neglectingthe crossing rays whichattract you as you pass up. Look upwards to theDivineLight shining downward from Kcther upon you.From Yesod, leads upward the Path ofSamekh, Tem-perance; the Arrow, cleaving upwards, leads the way toTiphareth, thegreat central Sun.” D.D.C.F. also sug-gests that, having risen to Tiphareth, theAdept skryershould formulate to himself that he is bound to a Cross,exactly asoccurred in the Adeptus Minor Ceremony,and by invoking the Great Angel HUAbeseech helpand guidance in the pathway of Light. By this method,he may moreeasily ascend the planes which lead tothe glory of the Crown. Thus formulatingin the im-agination the different parts of the Tree of Life, andvibrating theGod-names appropriate to the Sephirothor Paths, the Seer may find himself, ifhis aspirationis sincere and keen, rising towards the Spiritual Light,< 24 >bathed in that golden glory of effulgence which iscontinuously shed from above.Though it may seem rather out of place to quoteAleister Crowley here, yet he haswritten things in hisMagick on this subject that are so very important thatI amimpelled to quote them here for the benefit ofthe student. The important drillpractises, in his belief,are:“i. The fortification of the Body of Light by theconstant use of rituals, by theassumption of God-forms, and by the right use of the Eucharist.u2. The purification and consecration and exaltationof that Body by the use ofrituals of invocation.“3. The education of that body by experience. It mustlearn to travel on everyplane; to break down everyobstacle which may confront it.”In a footnote to the above, he has appended a foot-note which I reproduceherewith:“The Aspirant should remember that he is a Micro-cosm. ‘Universus sum et Nihiluniversi a me alienumputo’ should be his motto. He should make it hisdailypractice to travel on the Astral Plane, taking inturn each of the most syntheticsections, the Sephirothand the Paths. These being thoroughly understood, andanAngel in each pledged to guard or to guide him atneed, he should start on a newseries of expeditions toexplore the subordinate sections of each. He maythenpractice Rising on the Planes from these spheres, oneafter the other inrotation. When he is thoroughlyconversant with the various methods of meetingun-expected emergencies, he may proceed to investigatethe regions of theQliphoth and the Demonic Forces.It should be his aim to obtain a comprehensiveknowl-edge of the entire Astral Plane, with impartial love oftruth for its ownsake; just as a child learns thegeography of the whole planet though he may havenointention of ever leaving his native land.”The clairvoyance thus obtained may be used tow'atch the progress of Ceremonies,when it becomes a< 25 >highly useful gift, sometimes a necessity; and also inobserving what occursastrally when certain Sigils orPentagrams are traced or Names vibrated.There are several methods of testing and protection,in addition to those alreadymentioned. The suprememethod of protection—though it is infinitely more thanatechnical means of banishing—is through the assump-tion of the God formHarpocrates. The astral imageshould be formulated either as rising from a Lotus,orelse standing erect over two crocodiles. Little need besaid about thistechnique; it is adequately describedelsewhere, in Z.i. Incidentally, this is anexcellentpreparation for meditation or vision, to formulate theform about andaround one, and to identify oneselfwith it.In the event, during any vision, that the Seer isapproached by entities, as towhose integrity or truecharacter he has some doubts, the simplest form oftestingis to formulate between the Seer and the ap-proaching entity the Banner of theWest. As describedin the document about the symbolism of the NeophyteCeremony,this Banner is that which bars and threat-ens. It is one of the insignia of theHiereus, whosethrone is in the West of the Temple, and his office isthat of “theAvenger of the Gods/’ so situated as torepresent a seat of witness and ofpunishment decreedagainst evil. And all his insignia partake of this sym-bolism.Thus, should the being be of an evil nature—“thus far and no farther” is themessage indicated to itby the Banner. The interposition of the Banner wouldbeimmediately efficacious, by causing it to disappearinstantaneously. If, however,the entity is well-inten-tioned and not evil, no harm will have been done bythatformulation. No balanced force, no power of good,will object or resentlegitimate forms of testing itsintegrity.Since, likewise, the Banner of the East, one of theinsignia of the Hierophant inthe East of the Temple,“represents the ascent of the Initiate unto perfect< 26 >knowledge of the light/' it may assist to formulate thisBanner about his ownbeing. The Central Cross of theBanner will suggest his own form withoutstretchedarms—a true calvary cross. About him, the Seer willvisualise vividlythe interlaced red and blue trianglesof the Tiphareth hexagram, at the same timeimaginingthat the white triangle of the Supernals has descendedinto his heart.The alternate and occasionally simul-taneous use of these Banners is a powerfulmeans ofbanishing the evil, and invoking balanced power toone’s aid. In therubrics of certain rituals, the injunc-tion occurs to formulate this Bannerabout talismansor flashing Tablets that are being consecrated, as thisprocessassists the descent or the incarnation of theLight, or the invoked force, intothe symbol.The employment of the Rose-Cross together withthe vibration of thePentagrammaton, YHShVH islikewise another method of ensuring protection andofbanishing evil. Usually, as previously stated, any threatof danger on theelemental planes represented by theTattwa symbols may be met simply by thevibrationof the appropriate divine names, and, though veryrarely necessary, bythe banishing Pentagrams tracedin the air. The Rose Cross and thePentagrammatonwill apply more to planes above or more powerful thanthose of theTattwas. Experience combined with asound instinct will dictate to the Seer whensuch sym-bols should be used. He will find it occasionally ofgreat assistance tocommence his experiments by thepreliminary use of the Banishing Rituals andbyburning some incense.In the Outer Order of the Stella Matutina, or theGolden Dawn, formal dress forthis type of work asfor Temple ceremonies consisted of a black gown,redslippers, and a black and white nemyss; the sash ofthe grade could also beworn. In the Order of the R.R.et A.C., it was customary to wear a white gown,yellowor gold slippers, a nemyss of white and yellow stripes,and the Rose-Crosslamen on one’s breast. The Lotus< 27 >Wand should be employed and held in the hand whilstskrying,, and the FourElemental Weapons—FireWand, Water Cup, Air Dagger, and Earth Pentacle,should beplaced before one. If there is a small tableconvenient, this should be coveredwith a black cloth,and the implements grouped on this as upon the Altar,whilethe Cross and Triangle of the Order should beput in the centre. Sometimes, asympathetic projectioninto the elements may be encompassed by the pre-liminaryuse of the appropriate Prayer of the Elementsprovided in the grade rituals.<28>OF SKRYING AND TRAVELLINGIN THE SPIRIT-VISIONBy V. H. Soror, V.N.R.Having acquired the general rules, it is probable thatthe student will discoverfor himself particular methodsmore or less suited to his own particulartemperament.But it may prove useful to some for me to write in somedetail themode of skrying and of astral projectionwhich I have proved likely to bringsuccessful results,and which by reasons of its continual tests would tendtolessen the many chances of illusion. Before proceed-ing further it may be wellto refer to the MicrocosmLecture (in Volume One) regarding the theory ofskry-ing and astral projection.The rules for skrying and astral projection beingalmost similar, the twosubjects can be studied to-gether, the one being taken as the complement oftheother.You can commence the operation “skrying” simply.That is to say, not projectingthe astral beyond thesphere of Sensation into the Macrocosmos, but retain-ing itand perceiving some scene in the Universereflected in the symbol which you hold,this latterbeing to you as a mirror which shall reflect to yousome scenes notwithin your range of sight. Andsecondly, you can continue the operation by usingthesame symbol, and by passing through it project yourselfto the scene inquestion, which before you had onlyperceived as a reflection. The latter processwill prob-ably appear more vivid to the perception than theprior one, just as inmaterial vision one is less likelyto be deceived by going to a place andactually examin-< 29 >ing it, than by obtaining knowledge of it from a merereflection in a mirror.For example, in the room in which I am now, I seereflected in a mirror a portionof the garden. I obtainan impression of all within my range of sight, butnotnearly so powerful a one as when I step out into thegarden to the spot inquestion, and examine all theobjects therein, feel the atmosphere, touch theground,smell the flowers, etc.But it is well to practise both methods. The latterwill probably be found to bemore instructive thoughfar more fatiguing, since you will, when projectingtheastral, have to supply it with much vitality, drawnmostly from the Nephesch.In both skrying and astral projection, then, the keyof success would appear tobe, alternately to employIntuition and Reason, firstly by permitting,eachthought-picture to impress itself on the brain in themanner comprehendedgenerally by the word ‘inspira-tion/ followed by the reason applying itsknowledgeof correspondences to an affirmation or correction ofthe same.You must be prepared to receive impressions ofscenes, forms and sounds as vividthought forms.“Thought forms” I use for want of a better word. Therearedistinctly in these experiences, things heard, thingsfelt as well as thingsseen, which would prove that thequalities that we are here using are really thesubli-mated senses. That the faculty of clairvoyance, etc.exists is easilyprovable after a little patient exercisewith one of the first methods given untous for thepractice of skrying.Take the Tattwa cards, and from them choose oneat random, without looking to seewhat symbol it mayrepresent, and lay it down on a table face downwards.Then trymentally to discover the symbol. To do thismake your mind a blank as much aspossible (yetalways keeping control over the same) chasing there-from, for thetime being, the reasoning element,< 3° >memory, etc. You will find that after a few momentsof gazing attentively at theback of the card, that itwill seem as though the thought form of theTattwaappeared to enter the mind suddenly, and later, whenmore practised, itwill probably appear t:o you as if theTattwa symbol were trying to precipitateitself ma-terially through the back of the card, (i) But some-times, especiallyif the cards have been long kepttogether in the pack in the same order, we mayfindthat the back of the card in question is charged astrallynot with the symbolupon its face, but with that uponthe card whose face has been next its back inthe orderof the pack.Some may find it easier to turn the card over astrally,that is in imagination,and in imagination endeavourto perceive what flashes into the mind at thatmoment.As it is with the Tattwas that our first experiencesare made, I wall choose oneto illustrate the followingrules, preferably one that shall be in harmony withthetime that I commence my working.(2).Rules for Skrying. Work if possible in an especial-ly prepared magical room, S.M. altar in the centre,on which stand the four elements and the CrossandTriangle, incense burning, lamp lighted, water in thecup, (3), bread andsalt. As well as these, place on theAltar your four magical implements. Clotheyourself inyour White Robe, and 5 — 6 sash, wearing on breastyour Rose-Cross.Have by you your Sword and Lotus Wand. Sit atthe side of the Altar facing theQuarter of the Element,Planet or Sign with which you are working. Shouldanyother Frater or Soror be with you, arrange that theyshall sit in balanceddisposition (5) around the Altar.That is, if the forces with which you work bein theWest, your place is East of the Altar facing West acrossit. Should it beinconvenient for you to have your ownconsecrated room, or to have all or any ofyour imple-ments for your experiment, do your utmost to imaginethem as astrallyexisting about you, and in any case< 31 >in astral projection wear the garments and insigniaastrally all through theexperience. In fact, after con-stant, most constant, practice you will notprobablyfind the absolute physical so necessary. Yet remember,that though thematerial in magical working is theleast important of the planes in one sense,yet in an-other it is of the utmost importance for it crystallisesthe astralplane and completes it. And also havebefore you the exact correspondences ofcertain uni-versal formulae (for in the aforesaid insignia andimplements youhold a perfect representation of theUniverse (6), the contemplation of whichshould initself tend to prevent your mind dwelling on irrelevantsubjects, but onthe contrary compel your attention tothe sublime studies of the mysteries of theMacro-cosm.) Also do these Insignia, which have been conse-crated, give you acertain power through their havingattracted rays of force from the InfiniteInvisible moreor less potent in proportion to your development.The importance of using the implements on everyoccasion would appear to begreat. For the implementassists the invoking of a ceremony, and the lattershouldhelp the implement, and therefore every voyage,for example, to the realms ofFire or Water should adda flame to the Wand and moisture to the Cup.Next purify the room with Fire and Water and theLesser Banishing Ritual of thePentagram. Imaginethat we have chosen as a Tattwa, Apas-Prithivi. Forthis symbolnaturally, use the correspondences ofWater and Earth, but bear in mind that theWorld ofWater is here chiefly expressed, the Earth being sec-ondary. Thereforein this particular example, it is wellto use principally the Cup, the Pentacleonly in a minorsense. To imply this, use the Cup to make even manyof the Earthsymbols, and only occasionally employthe Pentacle in working the particularsymbol.In this suppositious case of , thoroughly to fill< 32 >your Sphere with the idea of this Tattwa, draw withthe Cup around your Room theGreater InvokingRitual of the Pentagram both of Water and of Earth.Then returnto your seat, and for Process One, Skrying,do the following. Place the Tattwacard before you onthe Altar, take the Cup in the right hand and thePentacle inthe left, and look at the symbol long andsteadily until you can perceive itclearly as a thoughtvision when you shut your eyes. Vibrate the Names ofWaterand of Earth (Empeh Arsel, etc.) and try torealise the mental union more andmore. It may helpyou to perceive it as a large crescent made of blue orsilverywater containing a cube of yellow sand. Con-tinue trying to acquire a keenperception of the Tattwauntil the Element and its shape and its qualitiesshallseem to have become a part of you, and you shouldthen begin to feel asthough you were one with thatparticular Element, completely bathed in it, and asifall other Elements were non-existent. If this be cor-rectly done, you willfind that the thought of any otherElement than the one with which you areworking willbe distinctly distasteful to you.Having succeeded in obtaining the thought vision ofthe symbol, continuevibrating the Divine Names withthe idea well fixed in your mind of callingbefore youon the card a brain picture of some scene or landscape.This, when itfirst appears, wall probably be vague, butcontinue to realise it more and moreof whatever nature(imagination or memory, etc. (8), you may believeit tobe—remembering that this is a passive state ofthe mind, and not yet is the timeto test or reason(9). Only when the thought picture shall havebecomesufficiently tangible and vivid, and you find that youare beginning tolose the sense of confusion and vague-ness should you begin to apply tests.Before this period,all reasoning, all doubting, is destructive to theexperiment.In all probability, the thought picture may becomeso clear to you (though thismay be a matter of time<33 >and much practice) that it will seem as though thepicture were trying toprecipitate through the symbol.In such a case as this there can be nodifficulty, for thevision will be nearly as clear to the perception as amaterialone might be. But you can arrive at a greatdeal by merely receiving theimpression of the land-scape as a thought. For example, I perceive appearinganexpanse of sea, a slight strip of land—high greyrocks or boulders rising out ofthe sea. To the left along gallery of cliffs jutting out some distance intothesea (to). This appears sufficiently vivid, so I begin mytests. I suspect mymemory chiefly, so I draw in frontof the picture on the card, with the LotusWand, alarge TAU in light. Then, believing that I may haveconstructed the scenein imagination, I now formulateon the card a large Caph. In this case, neitherof thesesymbols banish or dim the scene in any way, so Icontinue. (But if thescene vanishes or changes orbecomes blurred, it is well to banish with aPentagramwhatever may remain on the card, and simply re-commence the process atthe point where you areendeavouring to attract a picture on the card.)I now draw over the picture with the Cup the waterPentagram, and with thePentacle the Earth Penta-gram (ii) using the correct vibration. Thisintensifiesthe picture, and I now perceive flung into it manyfigures,principally of the Water spirit type. On gazingfurther, and repeating thevibration, I perceive a muchlarger figure than the elenientals, overshadowingthem,clothed in blue and white, with some glimmering ofsilver. To obtain detailI must work for some timelonger, and must continue invoking with my waterandearth Symbols, and look and test alternately.Believing that sufficient has been herein explained toenable a student tounderstand the general method ofthis process of skrying, I will proceed furtherto therules for astral projection, but be it remembered thatit is possible tocarry this vision very far indeed, and< 34 >that the student should by no means stop where Ihave done.Astral Projection. (12). Therefore you will followthe rules given in thepreceding pages for Skrying, untilthe point where the symbol oi the Tattwa hasbecomeperfectly vivid to the perception and when you feelas though you werealmost one with the Element. Youmay modify the earlier stages of the working bysoenlarging the symbol astrally that the human being canpass through it. Whenvery vivid, and not until then,pass, spring or fly through it, and do not begintoreason till you find yourself in some place or landscape(13). And as before,only test when the landscape shallhave become a tangible and somewhat completepic-ture. If you have made your mind a blank as much aspossible, the first ideathat enters your mind (that isto say vividly) after you have traversed thesymbolshould be a- correct correspondence of the Tattwain question.Having already, by the process of skrying, obtaineda vision of , in thisparticular case I will usethe same symbol, on which I still perceive the reflectedpicture, and will leapthrough it, and go astrally to thescene in question. I therefore astrally fly orleapthrough it.My first impression is to find myself standing on aboulder slightly out at sea,which I had noted as animportant point in the picture. I realise that Iamstanding clothed in my 5 — 6 insignia and white robe,on this rock, facing theshore. Turning to the right I amconscious of the gallery of cliffs, and to theleft andback of me the sea, everywhere.(On the planes, it would appear well to act exactlyas one would in a physicalexperience or a landscape,realising each step as one goes, not trying to lookonboth sides at once or at the back of one’s head, but< 35 >turning first to the right hand and examining that, andthen to the left, thenturning right around, and so on.It is better as much as possible to remain inone spot(until very experienced) to avoid reflexes. In fact, themore practicallythe experiences are worked, the morechance of success.)I have an impression that the air is very cold. I stoopdown and feel the rock,which I find is of a coral nature.I have already tested this vision in processOne (skry-ing), but it is well to repeat the same, to see if I amsufficiently intouch with the landscape. I thereforetrace with my astral Lotus Wand the symbolsI evokedbefore, the TAU and the CAPH, in white light, makingthem very forcibly.In fact, I do not cease tracing themuntil I actually perceive them as vividly asI do thelandscape. Seeing that the scene does not vanish orbecome dim (14) I nowwith my Astral Cup andPentacle, draw in Light very large Water andEarthPentagrams, standing on the sea. These, even morethan the former symbolsshould be continued andaccentuated until they become to the impression ofthemind as living entities as the landscape itself. Ifthese latter be correctlydrawn and sufficiently realised,there will be little chance of illusion duringthe rest ofthe experience.The drawing of these Pentagrams standing above thesea appears at once toincrease the vitality of the scene,for the rather intangible Elementals andAngelic Beingthat I had perceived in the reflected picture becamemore and morereal to the impression.Had I commenced at once with astral projectionwithout the introduction of mySkrying experience, Ishould have had probably to evoke these figures. Insuch acase, using the Invoking Pentagrams of Water,I should continue vibrating theDeity Names,-etc. ofthese Elements (employing as well as the namesbeforementioned, those of the Angels and Rulers, such namesas Tharsis, Kerub,etc., being very potent) and wouldcall upon a force by right of these names andsymbols< 36 >to manifest, and I should continue this process untilsome forms appeared.After careful examination, by first receiving theimpression and then testing it,I can describe thefollowing. The Angelic being, feminine in type, palebrown hairand light grey-green eyes, is draped in blueand white, draperies heavy innature, and wears acrown formed of crescents. She holds in the left handacurious cup, heavy, and with a squarish base, and inthe right a wand with asymbol much much like thepositive element of Water.The Elementals vary in type, the majority being ofthe mermaid and merman nature,but again manytending to the Earth and Air nature.Turning to the Angelic Being, I make the 5 = 6 Signsand LVX Signs, and to theElementals the 3 = 8 and1 = 10 Signs, and by right of these (that is to saybythe knowledge of the central spirit, and, in their in*stance of that of waterand earth) I ask to haveexplained some of the secrets of the working of theplaneof ^The Angel having answered my signs by similar ones,gives the impression that sheis willing to instruct me.(This can enter the mind as an extraneous thought,ormay be heard (15) clairaudiently.) She shows howeven the work on thisparticular spot is varied, andaccording to the types of the Elementals is thelabourallotted. Some of the Elementals tending to the gnometype are digging inthe cliffs, with spiky instruments,and boring holes therein, thereby permittingthe waterto enter freely. (This may explain the spongy ratherthan broken aspectof the rock). The mermaid andmerman Elementals, which are in the large majority,Ithink, receive some of the dust, which they carry intothe sea. (Some of thismay go to form islands.) Othersalso are bringing earth and weeds and such-likefromthe depths, also probably to form land. There are also< 37 >figures holding funnel-like Cups who rise from the sea,and having drawn air intothem, dive again, carryingthat element into the sea. (16)It can be understood how these investigations canbe carried to very greatdetail, but to be as brief aspossible I ask if I may be shown the effect of thisRayof on the Universe generally and on this Planetin particular.I understand that the effect of the Ray is generatingand fructifying generally,and on the whole beneficent,though everything would depend on the Forcewithwhich it was united. Its correlative would be thick richwater, containingsuch substance. I ask for its influenceon the Earth. (To do this I can show as athought-picture this planet of ours, with its continents, seas,etc., drawnthereon, and pray this Angel to send a rayfirst to one spot and then toanother.) In answer Iperceive the ray falling right through the water oftheEarth, as if the affinity lay with all land under water.“The Eifter of Earthin the Waters is its Name” doesthe Angel say. Nearly all vegetation attractsthis ray,but very especially water plants, most of all thosegrowing under water.The Zoophyte only partiallyattracts it, this latter seeming rather largelycomposedof some active element, Fire, I think. Among animalsthe Ray appears tofall on the seal and hippopotamus,and has a general affinity for most amphibiousanimals.With fish, the link seems to be small, a tortoise, a frog,and a snailare shown me, and some water-fowl of theduck type, very few actual birds, a seafowl to anextent.Falling on man, on the savage it would appear tobe beneficial to healthgenerally, to give a feeling ofwell-being, and would also govern to some extentgen-eration. Its tendency would be to accentuate sensualityand laziness. On theintellectual man it increases intui-tion, with some desire to clothe idea withform, there-< 38 >fore the first vague development of form in the mindof the artist. (As beforeremarked, these experiencescan be carried very far indeed, but as thisexperiencehas already become rather voluminous I will cease atthispoint—believing that sufficient is here expressed tosuggest the manner ofworking these astral experiencesgenerally.)I salute therefore the Angel with the LVX Signs andthe Elementals by the 3—8 and1=10 Signs, and banishastrally the Pentagram and other symbols that I havetracedupon the scene. The more powerfully the sym-bols have been evoked, the morepowerfully shouldthey be banished.If you should be feeling a sensation of fatigue, as Ibefore mentioned, maketowards the symbols the sign ofthe Enterer indrawing their vitality intoyourself againby the sign of Harpocrates. Then return by the way inwhich youcame, that is through the symbol, and backinto your room. (17) Once in yourroom, perform theBanishing Ritual of the Pentagrams (Supreme) thatyou haveevoked; supposing a scene to remain on thesymbol of the Tattwa banish that also.When you havehad considerable practise it is probable that such de-tailed careas is herein indicated will not be necessary.Should the operation be toocomplicated to accomplishat one sitting it would be possible to divide itintoparts. It is certain that you will find that you havepractised yourspiritual vision and acquired moreknowledge in one experience carefully workedandtested than in a hundred careless and vague experi-ments which simplystrengthen mental deception,NOTES1. This experiment is very good for the practice ofSpiritual Sight, and in thismanner you can easily provecorrectness of vision. Also for this kind of simpleex-perience you need not prepare yourself spiritually tosuch an extent as withfurther working, so that you can< 39 >have your cards if you wish continually with you, andpractise with them when youwill, at odd moments.2. To find Tattwa when in course, note time ofsunrise. Akasa always begins withsunrise and lasts 24minutes, followed by Vayu 24 minutes, Tejas 24 min-utes,Apas 24 minutes, Prithivi 24 minutes.3. Placed at junction of Cross and Triangle, theincense, lamp etc,, should be atangles of arms of Cross,4. All 5 = 6 members who are Zel. Ad.

If 2 persons, one should be opposite the other.If 3 persons, form a triangle.If 4 persons, form a square.If s persons, a pentagram, etc.6. The G. D., Altar, the most synthetical of thesymbols. Material universe ruledby the Spirit andFour Elements. The Rose-Cross contains the affirma-tion of theprincipal divisions of the Universe, syn-thetical like the Altar, but particularin the sense thatit is attributed to the Sephira Tiphareth, the centralSun, andis therefore the symbol for the Microcosm—-Man, the Adept, he to whom perfectionof the Micro-cosm means a certain conscious union with theMacrocosm.The white robe and yellow girdle imply Purity—Kether, Harmony—Gold, Tiphareth.Lotus Wand—Mercy. Sword—Severity.7. Imagination (eidolon) means the faculty ofbuilding an Image. The imaginationof the artist mustlie in the power, which he possesses more or less inproportionto his sincerity, and his intuition, of per-ceiving forces in the Macrocosm, andallying orattuning himself thereto, his talents naturally and hisartificialtraining permitting him to formulate imageswhich shall express those forces.8. During this process, it is more than likely that< 4°>you will be believing that the picture is one of memory,of imagination, ofconstruction, etc. All these qualitiesbeing analogous to the faculty that youare employing,and the probability of their arising at this momentwill be great.9. Let it be remembered that this can only be a partof the plane of the Symbolexpressed by10. Employ the “Lords who Wander” (the 7 Planets),the planetary Tarot trumps, asimportant test symbols.For Memory T? n Lord of the Nightof Time.For ConstructionFor Anger, ImpatienceFor VanityFor PleasureFor ImaginationIf 36 BO 1$ ^5 =For Wandering Thoughts j) J11. Use occasionally the Pentacle, so as not to ignoreto too great an extent thepart that Earth plays herein.12. In the case of starting the entire experience withAstral Projection only,you will understand that youignore the portion of the process which attractsthepicture to the card, but simply go forward through thesymbol when once thelatter is realised.13. If working with correct correspondences, you arebound to arrive at someplace answering to the same,if you project your astral sufficiently.14. If after these repeated tests the Vision becomesdiminished or changes verymuch, banish with theAstral implement, and return in the way you came,throughthe symbol, and start again freshly. If youfeel you have expended too much forcein the symbolswhich you traced in the scenes, redraw some of theforce spent intoyourself again by the formula of thesigns of Horus and Harpocrates. Extendtowards the< 41 >symbols in the sign of Hoor, redrawing them intoyourself by the sign ofHoorpokraat.15. Sometimes it seems as though one had to findthe words to translate theimpression; sometimes thewords appear to be found already, for one believesthatone has heard them.16. The symbol shows the potency of the whorl-formation.17. Some students, I believe, have great difficulty inreturning. In such a caseone can do so gradually byfirst flying into space, thinking of this Planet,fixingthe thoughts on the particular country, then on theparticular spottherein, then on the House, and lastlyon the room and entering therein. But inmost casesthis would be unnecessarily complicated.< 42 >TATTWA VISIONSHere follow two Tattwa visions by Soror Vestigia.These are provided as simpleexamples of the technique,and the procedure to be followed. The first of themisthe fiery sub-element of Earth, Tejas of Prithivi.Vestigia states that she found herself, after goingthrough the imagined symbols,“in a volcanic district.No fire is to be seen, but the type of land isvolcanic.Hill and mountains, hot air, and sunny light. Using aPentacle, andcalling on the Earth Names, I see beforeme a species of Angelic King Elemental.On testinghim, I find that he gives me the Neophyte SalutingSign, and thePhilosophus (Fire) Sign. He bow's low tothe symbols that I give him, and saysthat he is wallingto show me some of the working of the plane. He has abeautifulface, somewhat of the Fire type, yet sweetin expression. He wears a GoldenCrown, and a fieryred cloak, opening on to a yellow tunic, over whichbeing ashirt of mail. In his right hand he bears a wand,the lower end or handle beingshaped somewhat asthe Pentacle implement, and the staff and upper endbeing asthe Fire Wand. In his left hand (but this Ido not clearly see) he bears a FireWand; I think thatthe right hand points upwards and the left downwards,and is asymbol to invoke forces. Little figures of thegnome type come at his call. Whencommanded somebroke the rocky parts of the Mountain with pick-axesw'hich theycarry. Others appear to dig in the ground.In breaking off these rocky pieces,there fall away littlebits of bright metal or copper. Some of theseGnomescollected the bits of metal and carried them away inlittle wallets slungby a baldrick from their shoulders.We followed them and came to somemountainouspeaks. From these peaks issued some large and fierce,< 43 >some hardly perceivable, fires. Into cauldrons or bowlsplaced above these fires,the collected pieces of metalwere placed. I was told that this was a lengthyprocess,but asked that I might see the result of what appearedto be a gradualmelting of this metal. I was then shownsome bowls containing liquid gold, butnot I imagine,very pure metal. I again followed my guide, the AngelicKingElemental Ruler, who gave me his name as Atapa,and followed by some gnomesbearing the bowl ofliquid gold, we came, after passing through manysub-terranean passages cut in the mountains, to a hugecavern of immense breadthand height. It was like aPalace cut out of the rock. We passed through rudelycutpassages, until we reached a large central hall, atthe end of which was a Daison which were seated theKing and Queen, the courtier gnomes standing around.“This Hall seemed lighted by torches, and at intervalswere roughly cut pillars.The Gnomes who accompaniedus presented to the King and Queen their gold.Theselatter commanded their attendants to remove this toanother apartment. Iasked the King and Queen for afurther explanation, and they appointingsubstitutesin their absence, retire to an inner chamber whichappeared moreelevated than the rest. The architecturehere seemed to be of a different kind.This small hallhad several sides, each with a door, draped by a curtain.In thecenter of the Hall was a large tripod receivercontaining some of the liquid goldsuch as that we hadbrought with us. The King and Queen who before hadworn thecolours of Earth now donned, he the red, andshe the white garments. They thenwith their Earth-Fire Wands invoked and joined their wands over theTripod. Thereappeared in the air above, a figure suchas Atapa, he who had brought me here.He, extendinghis wand, and invoking, caused to appear from eachdoor a figure ofa planetary or zodiacal nature. Theseeach in turn held out his wand over thegold, usingsome sigil which I can but dimly follow. The gold eachtime appearingto undergo a change. When these< 44 >last figures have retired again behind the curtains, theKing and Queen used aspecies of ladle and compressedtogether the gold, making it into solid shapesand plac-ing one of these at each of the curtained doors. Somegold stillremained in the bowl. The King and Queendeparted, and it seemed to me that I sawa figure againappear from behind each curtain and draw away thepieces of gold.”The second one I shall quote is a vision of Spirit ofWater, Akasa of Apas, alsoby Vestigia.“A wide expanse of water with many reflections ofbright light, and occasionallyglimpses of rainbow col-ours appearing (perhaps symbolising the beginningofformation in Water). When divine and other nameswere pronounced, elementals ofthe mermaid and mer-man type appear, but few of other elemental forms.Thesewater forms are extremely changeable, onemoment appearing as solid mermaids andmermen, thenext melting into foam.“Raising myself by means of the highest symbols Ihave been taught, and vibratingthe names of Water,I rose until the Water vanished, and instead I behelda mightyworld or globe, with its dimensions and divi-sions of Gods, Angels, elementals,demons—the wholeuniverse of Water (like the tablet ruled by EMPEHARSEL GAIOL), Icalled on this latter name, and theUniverse seemed to vivify more and more. Ithen calledon HCOMA, and there appeared standing before mea mighty Archangel(with four wings) robed in glisten-ing white, and crowned. In one hand, theright, heheld a species of trident, and in the left a Cup filled tothe brim withan essence which appeared to be derivedfrom above. This essence, brimming over,poured downbelow on either side. From the overflowing or over-running of thisCup, which derives its essence fromAtziluth, apparently the cup being in Briah,the Worldof Yetzirah obtains its moisture. It is there differenti-ated into itsvarious operative forces.“These operative forces are represented by Angels<45 >each with their respective office in the world of mois-ture. These forcesworking in Yetsirah, when descend-ing and mingling with the Kether of Assiah,areinitiating the force of that which we as human beingscall Moisture.”< 46 >M.THE VISION OF THE UNIVERSAL MERCURY“We stood upon a dark and rocky cliff that overhungthe restless seas. In the skyabove us was a certainglorious sun, encircled by that brilliant rainbow,whichthey of the Path of the Chamelion know.“I beheld, until the heavens opened, and a form likeunto the Mercury of theGreeks (i) descended, flash-ing like the lightning; and he hovered between theskyand the sea. In his hand was the staff (2) wherewiththe eyes of mortals areclosed in sleep, and wherewithhe also, at will, re-awakeneth the sleeper; andterriblydid the globe at its summit dart forth rays.

In therighthand was the Caduceus, and the left bore a scrollshowing the wordsdescribed in the text.—I.R.)< 50 >TALISMANSTHE FORMATION OF TALISMANSAND FLASHING TABLETSA TALISMAN is a magical figure charged with theforce which it is intended torepresent. In the construc-tion of a Talisman, care should be taken to makeit,as far as is possible, so to represent the Universal Forcesthat it should bein exact harmony with those you wishto attract, and the more exact thesymbolism, the moreeasy it is to attract the force—other things coinciding,suchas consecration at the right time, etc.A SYMBOL should also be correct in its symbolism,but it is not necessarily thesame as a Talisman.A FLASHING TABLET is one made in the comple-mentary colours. A flashing colour,then, is the com-plementary colour which, if joined to the original,enables itto attract, to a certain extent, the Akasiccurrent from the atmosphere, and to acertain extentfrom yourself, thus forming a vortex which can attractits flashinglight from the atmosphere. Therefore, tomake anything of this description whichshall be reallyoperative, so does it proportionately tire you.The complementary colours are:White complementary to Black and GreyRed complementary to GreenBlue complementary to OrangeYellowr complementary to VioletOlive complementary to Red-OrangeBlue Green . .. complementary to RussetViolet complementary to CitrineReddish Orange complementary to Green BlueDeep Amber... complementary toIndigo.Lemon Yellow, complementary to Red VioletYellow Green.. complementary toCrimson< 51 >The other complementaries of other mixed colourscan easily be found from thisscale.Coming now to the nature and method of formationof the Talisman, the first thingto be remembered isthat it is not always a just and right thing to formaTalisman with the idea of completely changing thecurrent of another person’sKarma. In any case youcould only do this in a certain sense. It will bere-membered that the words of the CHRIST which pre-ceded His cures were “Thysins be forgiven thee,”which meant that the Karmic action was exhausted.Only anAdept who is of the nature of a God can havethe power, even if he have theright, to take uponhimself the Karma of another. That is to say, that ifyouendeavour to change completely, (I am not nowspeaking of adapting and making thebest of a person’sKarma), the life current, you must be of so great aforce thatyou can take this Karma from them by rightof the Divine Power to which you haveattained—inwhich case you will only do it in so far as it does nothinder theirspiritual development.If, however, this is attempted on a lower plane, itwill usually be found thatwhat you are endeavouringto bring about is in direct opposition to the Karmaofthe person concerned. It will not work the requiredeffect and will probablybring a current of exhaustionand trouble on yourself. Without doing much goodyouwill have attracted his own Karma into your ownatmosphere and, in fact,brought it on yourself.These remarks only apply to an attempted radicalchange in the Karma of another,which is a thing youhave no right to do until you have attained thehighestadeptship.The formation or adaptation of Talismans in or-dinary matters should be employedwith great discern-ment. What may assist in material things is often ahindrancespiritually, seeing that for a force to work,it must attract elemental forces ofthe proper descrip-<52>tion, which may thus, to an extent, endanger yourspiritual nature.Also, in making Talismans for a person, you mustendeavour to isolate yourselfentirely from him. Youmust banish from your mind any feeling of love orhate,irritation, etc., for all these feelings operate againstyour power,It is but rarely that a Talisman for the love of aperson is a right andjustifiable thing to construct.Pure love links us to the nature of the Gods.There is aperfect love between the Angels and the Gods becausethere is perfectharmony among them, but that is notthe lower and earthly love. Thus a Talismanmade forterrestrial love would be sealed with the impress ofyour own weakness,and even if successful, would reacton you in other ways. The only way in whichreal powercan be gained, is by transcending the material planeand trying to linkyourself to your Divine and HigherSoul. That is why trouble is so great aninitiator,because trouble brings you nearer spiritual things whenmaterial thingsfail.Therefore, a Talisman as a rule is better made forone in whom you have nointerest. In the work ofactual consecration, it is always a good thing topurifythe room and use the Banishing Ritual of the Penta-gram. All these areaids which the Adept, when suffi-ciently advanced, will know when to use andwhen notto do so. It is better, if possible, to finish a Talismanat one sitting,because it is begun under certain condi-tions and it may be difficult to putyourself in the sameframe of mind at another time.Another point that beginners are apt to run awaywith, is that Talismans can bemade wholesale. Supposea dozen Talismans were made to do good to asmanydifferent people, a ray from yourself must charge eachTalisman. You havesent out a sort of spiral from youraura which goes on to the Talisman andattracts a likeforce from the atmosphere—that is, if you have learnedto excitethe like force in yourself at the moment of< 53 >consecration. So that, in the case supposed, you wouldhave a dozen linksconnecting with you, like so manywires in a telegraph office, and whenever theforce whichany of these Talismans was designed to combat be-comes too strong forthe force centred therein, there isan instantaneous communication with you—sothat theloss of force to which you would be continually liablemight be such asto deplete you of vitality and causeyou to faint.In cases where Talismans and symbols have donetheir work, they should becarefully de-charged, andthen destroyed. If this is not done, and you takeasymbol, say of water, still charged and throw it into thefire to get rid of it,you are inflicting intense tormenton the Elemental you have attracted, and itwill re-acton you sooner or later. Also, if you throw away a stillchargedTalisman, thus desecrating it, it will becomethe property of other things,which, through it, willbe enabled to get at you. It is for these reasons thattheTalisman should be de-charged with the Pentagramand Hexagram according as itpartakes of the planetaryor zodiacal nature—and these remarks apply equallytoFlashing Tablets.If a Talisman is given to a person who goes away,and does not return it, you canrender it inoperativeby invoking it astrally and then de-charging it withgreatcare and force.A FLASHING TABLET should be carefully made,charged, and consecrated, and theneach morning theAdeptus should sit before it and practiseclairvoyance,endeavouring to go through it to the plane it represents,and thento invoke the power and ask for strength toaccomplish the matter desired, whichwill be grantedif it be a lawful and laudable operation.Any Flashing Tablet of two colours should be asnearly balanced in proportion ofthe extent of colouras possible—the ground one colour, and the chargeanother.There is also a mode in which three colourscan be used in a planetary talisman.This is done by< 54 >placing the seven colours on the Heptagram, and draw-ing two lines to the pointsexactly opposite, which willthus yield two flashing colours. This properlydrawn,will give the effect of a flashing light playing on thesymbol, partlyvisible physically and partly clairvoy-antly, i.e., if properly charged. Anadvanced Adeptshould be able to charge his Tablet to a certain extentas heconstructs it.The radical colour of the Planet is symbolical. Buta Talisman for harmony ofidea say, could be wellrepresented by the TIPHARETH of VENUS—a beau-tifulyellow-green, and so on.The Lion Kerub of VENUS would represent spiritualfire and thus symbolises theinspiration of the poet—the colour being a soft and beautiful pearl grey, andthecharges should be white. The Watery part of Venuswould represent the reflectivefaculty and answer tospiritual beauty, colour a bluish-green. The Vaultcontainsa perfect scale of Talismans of every descrip-tion of Planet, and shows how aplanetary man willlook at everything according to the colour of his aura,due tothe planet under which he is bom. The realAdept comes forth from the sides tothe centre. He isno longer under the dominion of the Stars.Having made a Magical Talisman, you should usesome form of charging andconsecrating it, which issuitable to the operation. There are certain wordsandLetters which are to be invoked in the charging of aTablet, the Lettersgoverning the Sign under which theoperation falls, together with the Planetassociatedtherewith (if a planetary Talisman). Thus in Elementaloperations, youtake the Letters of the appropriatezodiacal triplicity, adding AL thereto, thusforming anAngelic Name which is the expression of the force.Hebrew Names as arule, represent the operation ofcertain general forces, while the names on theEnochianor Angelical Tablets represent a species of more par-ticular ideas. Bothclasses of Names should be used inthese operations.> 55 <After preparing the room in the way laid down forthe consecration of lessermagical implements, suppos-ing this to be an Elemental Talisman, firstformulatetowards the Four Quarters the Supreme Ritual of thePentagram as taught.Then invoke the Divine Names,turning towards the quarter of the Element.Let the Adeptus then, being seated or standingbefore the Tablet, and looking inthe requisite directionof the force which he wishes to invoke, take severaldeepinspirations, close the eyes, and holding the breath,mentally pronounce theletters of the Forces invoked.Let this be done several times, as if you breatheduponthe Tablet pronouncing them in the vibratory manner.Then, rising, make thesign of the Rose and Cross overthe Tablet, and repeating the requisite formula,firstdescribe round the Talisman, a circle, with the appro-priate magicalimplement, and then make the invokingPentagrams five times over it, as if thePentagramsstood upright upon it, repeating the letters of theTriplicity involvedwith AL added. Then solemnly readany invocation required, making the propersigils fromthe Rose as you pronounce the Names.The first operation is to initiate a whirl from yourself.The second, to attractthe force in the atmosphere intothe vortex you have formed.Then read the Elemental Prayer as in the Rituals,and close with the Signs of thecircle and the cross(that is the Rose-Cross) after performing thenecessaryBanishing.Be careful, however, not to banish over the newlyconsecrated Talisman, as thatwould simply dechargeit again and render it useless. Before Banishing, youshouldwrap the charged Talisman in clean white silkor linen.< 56 >SIGILSIn the Opening Ceremony of the grade of 5=6Adeptus Minor, the Complete Symbol ofthe Rose andCross is called the “Key of Sigils and of Rituals ” and itis furthersaid that it represents the Forces of the 22Letters in Nature, as divided into aThree, a Seven,and a Twelve.The inner Three Petals of the Rose symbolise theactive Elements of Air, Fire,and Water, operating inthe Earth, which is as it were the recipient ofthem,their container and ground of operation. They arecoloured, as are all theother petals, according to thehues of the Rainbow in the masculine (positive)scale.The seven next Petals answer to the Letters of theSeven Planets, and theTwelve Outer to the TwelveSigns of the Zodiac.Now if thou wilt trace the Sigil of any word or nameeither in the Air, orwritten upon paper, thou shaltcommence with a circle at the point of the initialletteron the Rose, and draw with thy magical weapon a linefrom this circle untothe place of the next letter of thename. Continue this, until thou hast finishedthe wordwhich the letters compose. If two letters of the samesort, such as twoBeths or Gimels, come together, thoushalt represent the same by a crook or wavein the lineat that point.And if there be a letter, as Resh in Metraton, throughwhich the line passeth toanother letter and which yetformeth part of the name, thou shalt make a noose inthe line at that point thus: —Q to make the same.If thou art drawing the Sigil thou mayest work it in therespective colours ofthe letters and add these togetherto form a synthesis of colour. Thus the SigilofMetraton shall be: blue, greenish-yellow, orange, red-orange, andgreenish-blue: the synthesis will be a red-dish-citron.< 57 >Picture #4 [images/img_0004.bmp]Picture #5 [images/img_0005.bmp](Note: If the reader will draw a Rose, copied fromthe complete symbol of theRose-Cross, about three-and-a-half to four inches in diameter, and tracetheabove Sigils on a piece of fairly transparent paperplaced over the Rose, hewill learn for himself howthese Sigils are drawn. He should experimenttracinghalf a dozen or so of these.—I.R.)Now we will trace, for example, the Sigils of theForces under Binah, the ThirdSephirah. Incidentally,the Sigils for the plane of a Sephirah are alwaysworkedout on this system in this order:First. Sigil of the Sephirah—Binah.Second.

OTHER SJGILS/SHABBATHAIk/\\/o YODHEVAUHE(4S)e>AGIEL (4S)ZAZHL (45)Spirit) are more usually taken from the MagicalKamea or Square of the Planetsaccording to a slightlydifferent system as will be shown hereafter.<6o>TELESMATIC FIGURESNow there is also a mode whereby, combining theletters, the colours, theattributions and their Synthesis,thou mayest build up a telesmatic Image of aForce,The Sigil shall then serve thee for the tracing of aCurrent which shallcall into action a certain ElementalForce. And know thou that this is not to bedone lightlyfor thine amusement or experiment, seeing that theForces of Naturewere not created to be thy playthingor toy. Unless thou doest thy practicalmagical workswith solemnity, ceremony and reverence, thou shalt belike an infantplaying with fire, and thou shalt bringdestruction upon thyself.Know, then, that if thou essay in the imagination toform an astral image fromthe Names, the first lettershall be the head of the Figure or Form, and thefinalletter shall be its feet. The other letters shall be, andrepresent in theirorder, its body and members.AGIEL, for example, shall give thee an Angelic Formof the following nature andappearance:Aleph, Air. The head winged, and of a golden colour,with long floating goldenhair.Gimel, Luna. Crowned with blueish silver crescent,and with a face like that of agrave andbeautiful woman, with a blueish halo.Yod, Virgo. The body of a maidenclothed in grassgreen robe.Aleph, Air. Golden wings of a large size, partlycovering the lower part of thefigure.Lamed, Libra. Feet and limbs well-proportioned and,either in the hand ofthe figure or lyingat its feet, the sword and scales of Jus-tice in brightgreen.Playing round the figure will be a greenish light, thecolour of its synthesis.The Keys of the Tarot may helpthee in the form.<61 >See well also that thou makest the Image as pureand beautiful as possible, forthe more impure orcommon the figure, the more dangerous is it unto thee.Writeupon the breast its Sigil, upon the girdle itsName, and place clouds below thefeet. And when thouhast done this with due solemnity and rigid correctnessofsymbolism, shunning as thou wouldst shun deathany suggestion of coarseness orvulgarity in an Angelicsymbol, then hear what it shall say unto thee.Seraphim will give thee an Angelic Figure like aWarrioress with Flame playingabout her, and a coun-tenance glorious like the Sun, and beneath her feetthestormy Sea and thunder clouds, and lightning abouther, and a glow as ofFlame. She has a triangular helmetor head-dress of Flame like the symbol ofFire.Graphiel will give thee a Great Angel like a FemaleWarrior with a most gloriouscountenance, crownedwith the Crescent and flashing with Light, and sur-roundedby Flame and Lightning and with Four Wings.The termination EL always gives to Angelic Formsthe Wings and Symbols ofJustice. The ending YAHwill make the Figures like enthroned Kings or Queens,andwith flaming glory at their feet.THE VIBRATORY MODEOFPRONOUNCING THE DIVINE NAMESIn vibrating the Divine Names, the Operator shouldfirst of all rise as high aspossible towards the idea ofthe Divine White Brilliance in KETHER—keepingthemind raised to the plane of loftiest aspiration. Unlessthis is done, it isdangerous to vibrate only with theastral forces, because the vibration attractsa certainforce to the operator, and the nature of the forceattracted restslargely on the condition of mind inwhich the operator is.The ordinary mode of vibrating is as follows: Takea deep and full inspirationand concentrate your con-<62 >sciousness in your heart, which answers to Tiphareth.(Having first, as alreadysaid, ascended to your Kether,you should endeavour to bring down the whiteBril-liance into your heart, prior to centering your con-sciousness there.)Then formulate the letters of the Name required inyour heart, in white, and feelthem written there. Besure to formulate the letters in brilliant white light,notmerely in dull whiteness as the colour of the ApasTattwa. Then, emitting thebreath, slowly pronouncethe Letters so that the sound vibrates within you,andimagine that the breath, while quitting the body, swellsyou so as to fill upspace. Pronounce the Name as ifyou were vibrating it through the whole Universe,andas if it did not stop until it reached the further limits.All practical occult work which is of any use, tiresthe operator or withdrawssome magnetism, and there-fore, if you wish to do anything that is at allimportant,you must be in perfect magnetic and nervous condition,or else you willdo evil instead of good.When you are using a Name and drawing a Sigilfrom the Rose, you must rememberthat the Sephirahto which the Rose and Cross are referred, is Tiphareth,whoseposition answers to the position of the heart, asif the Rose were therein. It isnot always necessary toformulate before you in space the telesmaticangelicfigure of the Name. As a general rule, pronounce theName as many times asthere are letters in it.< 63 >FURTHER ON TELESMATIC FIGURESAs before taught the Names of all Angels and AngelicForces terminate, with fewexceptions, in either AL orYAH, The Divine Name AL belongs to Chesed anditrepresents a good, powerful, and mighty force, but oisomewhat milder operationthan the Name YAH. Sincenot only the Angels but even devils are said todrawtheir force and power directly from the prolific sourceof the divineenergies, therefore frequently to the namesof evil spirits, is AL added. TheName YAH is addedto the name of an Angel or Spirit who exercises onlya good andsomewhat beneficent office.This being understood, these two terminations beingrather in the nature ofincidental attributions than ofessential distinction, they need not be taken toomuchnotice of in the construction of a telesmatic image.In building up such an image, you can either imagineit astrally before you, orpaint the actual resemblance.Care should however be taken to pronounce theDivineNames belonging to the world under which the teles-matic image undercourse of construction would fall.Thus to ATZILUTH are allotted Deific Names.ToBRIAH, Archangelic and so on. It i& also useful toemploy the Sephirotic Nameswhich are comprised inthe special world to which the Telesmatic Imageisallotted.It is well to note that the four Worlds them-selves formulate the Law involvedin the building upor expression of any material thing. The world ofATZILUTH ispurely archetypal and primordial, andto it, as before said, Deific Names areapplied. BRIAHis creative and originative, and to it certain Great GodscalledArchangels are allotted. YETZIRAH is forma-tive and Angelic Orders are allottedthereunto. ASS I AHwhich is the material world consists of the great King-domsof the Elementals, human beings, and in some<64>cases of the Qlippoth—though these latter really oc-cupy the planes belowAssiah.From these remarks it will be seen that a TelesmaticImage can hardly apply toAtziluth; that to Briah itcan only do so in a restricted sense. Thus aTelesmaticImage belonging to that world would have to be repre-sented with akind of concealed head, possessing a formshadowy and barely indicated,Telesmatic Images, then,really belong to YETZIRAH. Therefore it wouldbeimpossible to employ the telesmatic image of a DivineName in Atziluth, for itwould not represent that inthe world of Atziluth, but rather its correlationinYetzirah. In Assiah you would get Elemental forms.The sex of the figure depends upon the predominanceof the masculine or thefeminine in the whole of theLetters together, but a jumble of the sexes shouldbeavoided in the same form. The image built up shouldbe divided into as manyparts as there are letters,commencing at the upper part and so on in order.Inaddition to this method of determining the sex of theTelesmatic Image of aName, certain Names are in-herently masculine, others feminine, and someepicene,irrespective of the mere testimony of the Letters.SANDALPHON, for instance is thus analysed:SAMEKH Male PEH FemaleNUN Male VAU MaleDALETH Female NUN MaleLAMED FemaleTherefore masculine predominates, and if it were anordinary Name you would makea masculine Formout of it. But as this Name is especially applied to thefeminineKerub, it is an exception to the rule; it is anArchangelic Name, belonging tothe Briatic World andnot merely an Angelic Name relating to Yetzirah.SANDALPHONis also called Yetzer, meaning “left,”and its letters are: female, female andmale, so that, inthis case, it may be any of these.< 65 >The Seven Letters composing the Name SANDAL-PHON are thus adapted to theTelesmatic Image.SAMEKH Head. Would represent a beautifuland active face rather thin than fat,NUNNeck, would be admirably full.DALETH Shoulders of a beautiful woman.LAMED Heart and chest, the latterperfectlyproportioned.PEH Hips strong and full.VAU Legs massive.NUN Feet sinewy and perhaps winged.If it be desired to build up an elemental form out ofthis Name a very peculiarfigure would result.SAMEKHHead fierce, but ratherbeautiful.BlueNUNNeck with eagle’swings from behind.Blue-greenDALETHShoulders feminine,rather beautiful.Green-blueLAMEDChest of a woman.EmeraldPEHStrong and shaggy hipsand thighs.RedVAULegs of a Bull.Red-orangeNUN(final) Feet of an Eagle.Green-blueThis it will be seen, is almost a synthetical KerubicFigure. This figure may berepresented, as it were, withits feet on the Earth, and its head in the clouds.Thecolours in the scale of the King would synthesize as adelicate and sparklinggreen.The uncovered parts of the body would be blue, thecountenance belonging toSagittarius would be almostthat of a horse. The whole form would be like thatofa goddess between AT HOR and NEI TH holding a bowand arrows, that is ifrepresented as an Egyptiansymbol.If again, we endeavour to translate this Name into<66>symbols on a Tattwic Plane, we get the following:SAMEKH comes under FIRENUNcomes under WATERDALETH comes under WATER OF EARTHLAMED comes under AIRPEH comesunder FIRENUN comes under WATER.These would be synthesized thus: A silver crescent ona red triangle placed overa yellow square. All threewould be charged and enclosed within a largesilvercrescent.Now, taking an example, the Telesmatic Imageappertaining to the Letter ALEPH.This on the BriaticPlane, would be rather masculine than feminine andwould beresumed by a spiritual figure hardly visibleat all, the head-dress winged, thebody cloud-veiledand wrapped in mist, as if clouds were rolling overandobscuring the outline, and scarcely permitting the legsand feet to be seen.It represents the Spirit of Ether.In the Yetziratic World, it would be like aWarriorwith winged helmet, the face angelic but rather fierce,the body and armsmailed and bearing a child—thelegs and feet with mailed buskins and wingsattachedto them.In ASSIAH, this same letter ALEPH is terrificenergy and represents, as it were,mad force (the shapeof the Letter is almost that of a Swastika). On thehumanplane, it would represent a person who was alunatic and at times given tofrightful fits of mania.Translated to the elemental plane, it would representaform whose body fluctuated between a man and ananimal, and indeed, the Assiaticform would be a mostevil type with a force something like that compoundedof thatof a bird and that of a demon—an altogetherhorrible result. The Letter ALEPHrepresents spiritu-ality in high things, but when translated to theplanecontiguous to or below Assiah is usually somethinghorrible and unbalanced,because it is so opposed to<67>matter that the moment it is involved therein, there isno harmony between them.Radiating forces of Divine Light, otherwise calledAngelic Forms, have not genderin the grosser accepta-tion of the term, though they can be classed accordingtothe masculine and feminine sides. As, for example, inthe human figure, sex isnot so strongly marked in theupper part, the head, as in the body, while yetthecountenance can be distinctly classed as of a masculineor a feminine type.So, also, on quitting the materialplane, sex becomes less marked, or ratherappreciablein a different manner, though the distinction of mascu-line orfeminine is retained. And herein is the greaterror of the Phallic Religions—thatthey have trans-ferred the material and gross side of sex to Divine andAngelicplanes, not understanding that it is the lowerthat is derived from the higher bycorrelation in ma-terial development, and not the higher from the lower.Gender,in the usual meaning of the term, belongs tothe Elemental Spirits, KerubicForms, Fays, PlanetarySpirits and Olympic Spirits—also to the Qlippoth initsmost exaggerated and bestial aspects, and this is a ratioincreasing inproportion to the depths of their descent.Also, in certain of the evil ElementalSpirits, it wouldbe exaggerated and repulsive.But, in the higher and angelic natures, gender iscorrelated by forms, eithersteady and firm, or rushing.Firmness like that of a rock or pillar is the natureofthe feminine; restlessness and movement, that of theMasculine. Therefore, letthis be clearly understood inascribing gender to angelic forms and images.Ourtradition classes all forces under the heads of vehementand rushing force,and firm and steady force. Thereforea figure representing the former would be amasculineand that representing the latter, a feminine form.But for convenience in the formation of Telesmaticimages of ordinary occultnames and words, the lettersare arranged in masculine and feminineclassification.This classification is not intended to affirm that the<68>letters have not in themselves both natures (seeingthat in each letter as ineach Sephirah is hidden thedual nature of masculine and feminine) but showsmoretheir tendency as regards the distinction of force before-mentioned.Those, then, are rather masculine than feminine towhich are allotted forces morerapid in action. Andthose, again, are rather feminine than masculinewhichrepresent a force more firm and steady whence allletters whose sound isprolonged as if moving forwardare rather masculine than feminine. Certain othersareepicene, yet incline rather to one nature than toanother.TELESMATIC ATTRIBUTIONSOF THELETTERS OF THE HEBREW ALPHABETALEPH. Spiritual.

Iftheseletters and numbers are again translated into theirYetziratic attributionsand combined with the linealfigures represented by the numbers, an analysisofthe name is obtained compounded of two scales ofinterpretation.For instance, in the case of Kether, the letters areKaph, Tau, Resh. Caph isreferred in the SepherYetzirah to Jupiter, Tau to Saturn, and Resh to theSun.Again, the lineal figure of Caph, which reduces tothe number 2 by Aiq Bkr or theQabalah of NineChambers, will be the Cross. Tau reduces to 4, whoselineal figureis the square, Resh reduces also to 2, sym-bolised likewise by the Cross. 7'hereare three letters inthe name Kether—which itself, as a whole, may besymbolisedby a triangle. If the above symbolic linealfigures are placed within the linealfigure of the wholeName, the Triangle, “a species of Hieroglyphic form ofeachSephirah will result. This may again be repre-< 72 >sented by a cognate Angelic form, as taught in theFormation of Sigils from theRose.” The Yetziraticattributions will yield the information as to whatcol-ours, symbols, etc. are to be used in formulating theImage.The same principle applies to the remaining Sephi-rotic names.<73 >TALISMANS AND SIGILSThere are innumerable methods of forming Sigils foruse in connection withTalismans and their construc-tion. One method, using the Rose of theZelatorAdeptus Minor, has previously been described. In theOrder this was themethod most often used. Herein,will be found methods of forming talismanicemblemsand sigils from the Kameas of the Planets, or theirMagical Squares, andalso from the Geomantic pointsand symbols.So far as the Geomantic symbols are concerned, thestudent will do well to becomeacquainted with theinstruction on Geomancy in the section on Divination.Afterhaving become fully acquainted with the namesof the symbols, and their forms, aswell as havingobtained some experience of divination by that method,let him notethat Geomantic sigils or Talismanic em-blems, as they are sometimes called, areformed fromthe Geomantic figures by drawing various lines frompoint to point.These characters are then attributedto their ruling planets and ideas. Thesimplest formsof each will be found on page 73.Innumerable more sigils, and a host of other designsmay be formed from thefundamental Geomanticsymbols. As many as ten or a dozen different emblemsmay bederived from two or three of the symbols. Ifthe student uses a little ingenuityand imagination inthis matter, he will discover quite a lot as to the natureandimport of Sigils. The significance of the emblemsmay be divined, from one pointof view, by employingthem as “doors” through which to skry in the spirit-vision.More can be learned this way concerning thereal implication of Sigils thanalmost by any othermethod.< 74 >Picture #6 [images/img_0006.bmp]The signatures and Seals of the Angels and Geniiwho rule over each of thesymbols may be found in thefull instruction on Geomancy. Those seals andsigilsare highly important, and some place should be foundfor them on theTalisman.The student should make a number of experimentsdrawing harmonious and balancedtalismans, even< 75 >Picture #7 [images/img_0007.bmp]when it is not his intention to use and consecrate them.After drawing a half adozen rough sketches, he willalmost as though by accident stumble uponthe“knack” or drawing the “right” kind of talisman. Inthe Key of King Solomon,translated by McGregorMathers, may be found samples of about fortydifferenttypes of talismans, attributed to the Planets. Theseshould beconsulted, for they will convey quite a littleas to how symbols should be drawn.But they shouldnot be followed or copied. Talismans should be personalthings,made for personal ends, and based upon indi-vidual needs and conceptions.< 76 >The following important characters—letters of theAngelic or EnochianAlphabet—are attributed to theSeven Rulers in the Twelve Signs and theSixteenFigures in Geomancy.nbpL&T_ftev/Signifies Muriel and Populus, a figure of Chasmodai orLuna in Cancer increasing.Signifies Muriel and Via, a figure of Chasmodai andLuna in Cancer decreasing.Signifies Verchiel or For tuna Major, a figure of Sorathor the Sun in Northerndeclination.Signifies Verchiel or For tuna Minor} a figure of Sorathor the Sun in Southerndeclination.Signifies Hamaliel or Conjunctio, a figure ofTaphthartharath or Mercury inVirgo,Signifies Zuriel or Pudla, a figure of Kedemel or Venusin Libra,Signifies Barchiel or Rubens, a figure of Bartzabel orMars in Scorpio.Signifies Advachiel or Acquisitio, a figure of Hismaelor Jupiter in Saggitarius,Signifies Ilanael or Career, a figure of Zazel or Saturnin Capricorn,Signifies Cambriel or Tristiiia, a figure of Zazel or Sa-turn in Aquarius,Signifies Amnitzel or Laetitia, a figure of Hismael orJupiter in Pisces,Signifies Zazel and Bartzabel in all their ideals, beingCauda Draeonis,Signifies Hismael and Kedemel in all their ideas, beinga figure of CaputDraeonis.Signifies Melchidael or Puer, a figure of Bartzabel orMars in Aries,Signifies Asmodel and Amissio, a figure of Kedemel orVenus in Taurus.Signifies Ambriel or Albus, a figure of Taphthartharathor Mercury in Gemini,A mode of using the Talismanie forms drawn fromthe Geomantic Figures is to takethose yielded by theFigures under the Planet required and to place them< 77 >at opposite ends of a wheel of eight radii as shown be-low. A versicle suitableto the matter may then bewritten within the double circIe.Occasionally, asquareof any convenient number of compartments may besubstituted for the wheelor one form may be used forthe obverse and the other for the reverse of theTalis-man.Picture #8 [images/img_0008.bmp]Another very important mode of forming Sigils an-ciently was through the mediumof the Kameas of thePlanets, or the Magical squares. Magical squaresarearrangements of numbers so arranged as to yield thesame number when addedhorizontally, vertically, ordiagonally. Also the sum of the total of all thenumbersin the square is a number of special significance to theplanet to whichthat square is referred.The method of forming Sigils from these is verysimple. The knowledge of how thiswas done, however,had, during the time of my membership in the Order,completelyfaded from memory, and none of the mem-bers or the Chiefs of the Temple couldgive any in-formation. Yet this was the principal method employedby thetraditional authorities in obtaining Sigils. Themethod of using the Rose-Crossis an anachronism,and while in certain instances it is very useful or per-hapsthe most convenient mode, it has no root inantiquity. Not only had the knowledgeof Sigils fromthe Kameas faded from the Order, but the Chiefs eveneliminated themagical squares from the knowledgelectures. It was claimed that a number ofmistakes had<78>crept into the numbers on the squares. Had they knownit, the method and thecorrect form of the Squareswere in certain books and manuscripts in theBritishMuseum. None of them, however, made the leastattempt to recover the trueor accurate form of theKameas.The sole requisite to tracing Sigils of the Planetarynames are formed from theKameas is Aiq Beker, orthe Qabalah of Nine Chambers. (Incidentally, this toowaseliminated from the knowledge lectures.) By thismethod, the letters of theHebrew Alphabet are groupedtogether according to the similarity of theirnumbers.Thus in one Chamber, Gimel, Lamed and Shin areplaced; their numbers aresimilar—3, 30, and 300. Thesame rule applies to the others. The name of themethodobtains from the letters placed in the first two cham-bers. In the firstchamber are Aleph, Yod, and Qoph,whose numbers are 1, 10, and 100, while in thesecondchamber are Beth, Caph, Resh~-2, 20, and 200—thusAiq Bkr. The usual formis given below; while thereis another method of using the same grouping oflettersand numbers but placing them in chambers referredto the Sephiroth.30030320020210010IV7a122p*K6006065005°5400404DDi*13nnQ1900909800808700707YuPIBn1VTNow in order to find the Sigil of a Name by usingthe Kamea, it is necessary toreduce those letters andtheir numbers to tens or units by means of theabovequoted scheme. For example, in the case, say, of Zazel,the Spirit ofSaturn, the letters are Zayin 7, Aleph 1,Zayin 7, and Lamed 30. The only letterwhich requiresreduction in this instance will be Lamed which reducesto 3. Thenext step is to trace a line on the squarefollowing the succession of numbers.Thus, in the name< 79 >of Zazel, the line will follow the numbers 7, 1, returnto 7 again, and then to3. A little circle should be placedon the first letter of the Sigil to showwhere the namebegins.The so-called Seal or Sigil of the Planet is a sym-metrical design so arrangedthat its lines pass throughevery number on the square. The Seal thus becomesanepitome or synthesis of the Kamea.Below are given the Kameas of the seven planetstogether with the traditionalSeals of their Planets,Intelligences, and Spirits. The student will do welltoattempt to work these out himself. I shall give onemore example of a moredifficult kind, in order that nomisunderstanding may exist about the method ofSigilformation.The name Taphthartharath is the Spirit of Mercury,and his Sigil would be tracedupon the magical Squarehaving 64 squares, 8 on each side. The attributionofSquares to planets follows the attribution of the Sephi-roth on the Tree ofLife; thus Mercury is referred tothe eighth Sephirah HOD. Now Taphthartharathiscomposed of seven letters, Tau 400, Peh 80, Tau 400,Resh 200, Tau 400, Resh200, and Tau 400. This willreduce by Aig Beker to 40, 8, 40, 20, 40, 20, 40. Acon-tinuous line will be traced beginning with a circle in thesquare of 40, andmoving to each of the numbersquoted. All the other Sigils follow this same rule.There are also appended the Sigils and attributionsof the Olympic PlanetarySpirits. Nothing was knownin the Order about them, and they too wereextirpatedfrom the papers. More information may be found in theHeptameron ofPietro de Abano. These Sigils should beused for skrying as a means of acquiringknowledge asto their nature, using the appropriate planetary divineNames.<8o>KAMEA OF SATURN492357&/6Picture #9 [images/img_0009.bmp]Intelligence: AG I ELKAMEA OF JUPITE4f415197G115(lfO8i(o%513Picture #10 [images/img_0010.bmp]rIntelligence: YOPHIEL<8i>Picture #11 [images/img_0011.bmp]KAMEA OF MARSIt247X2054J225sn5J5-9JO184(42223619215Picture #12 [images/img_0012.bmp]Picture #13 [images/img_0013.bmp]Intelligence: GRAPHIEL< 82 >KA M E A OF SOL4*>Z5343517fl27n830l<5wjfe152524IS2o22211713252 9to92612565354251Picture #14 [images/img_0014.bmp]Picture #15 [images/img_0015.bmp]<83>KAMEA OF VENUSIt41lb4i/o55452343n42u2930&2449J836It\\33172a43195138/432/2644toIt398352214546154°934328Picture #16 [images/img_0016.bmp]Picture #17 [images/img_0017.bmp]<H>Picture #18 [images/img_0018.bmp]K AM E A OF MERCURY858595462 !G5/4915145253It(056412322444819 1(84532343829253539284o24213136303153 1n47442o214342249555412/3515o/6(M236f6o757Picture #19 [images/img_0019.bmp]<8s>KAMEA OF LUNA5778297o21671354563S193o112263i446m739So3172?55515us84o8152642456Sin499*4!733365252658185of427434«=612159to51X4375355668196cn5254476712Stfl|3obi1253445Picture #20 [images/img_0020.bmp]Picture #21 [images/img_0021.bmp]Spirit of the Spirits of the Moon:SHAD BARSCHEMOTH HA-SCHARTATHANIntelligence of the Intelligences of the Moon: MALCAHBETARSHISIM VE-AD RUACHOTHHA-SCHECHAUM<86>#*1\\ofO?9)ARATHORBETHORPHALEGHOCHHAGITHOPH1ELPHUL■ygy1LU[Picture #22 [images/img_0022.bmp]jjjyuiNAMES AND SIGILS OF OLYMPIC PLANETARY SPIRITSSo far as concerns the foregoing Sigils, tradition hasit that the Spirits areevil, the Intelligences good. TheSeals and Names of the Intelligences should beused onall Talismans for a good effect. Those of the Spirits ofthe Planets servefor evil, and should therefore not beused in any operation of a beneficial kind.The traditionhowever implies usually by an evil force, such as theSpirits of theplanets, a blind force, which contrary topopular notion can be used to good andbeneficial ends< 87 >when employed under the presidency of their immedi-ate superiors, the goodIntelligences. Thus to make useof, when it is absolutely necessary to do so, theSigilsof the Spirits, the Seals and Names of the Intelligencesshould beinscribed on the same Talisman as well.In addition to the Seals, Sigils and Emblems, it iscustomary to inscribe onTalismans and Pentacles theappropriate lineal figures. In the formation of amagicalTalisman or Pentacie, consider first of all under whatPlanet, Sign, orElement the matter falls. The next stepis to collect all the Names of theSephirah to which itis attributed, as well as those of its Archangels,Angels,Intelligences, etc. Also the Seals, Sigils, Numbers, Lin-eal Figures,Geomantic characters, etc., thereto belong-ing. Then, with all this materialbefore you, classify andarrange.The following notes are an abridged version of“Polygons and Polygrams” a highlyilluminatingdocument circulated in the Outer Order. It should beclosely studied,for it throws great light not only on thematter of lineal figures but on thewhole abstrusenumber philosophy of the Qabalah.<8S>POLYGONS AND POLYGRAMSThe Point within the Circle represents the operationof Kether in general, andthe Cross within the Circlethat of Chokmah, for therein are the roots ofWisdom.In using these lineal figures in the formation of Talis-mans under theSephiroth, remember that:The Point within the Circle == KetherThe Cross within the Circle — ChokmahTheTriangle within the Circle = BinahThe Square within the Circle = Chesed,and that the remaining Sephiroth should have thedouble, treble or quadrupleforms of their lineal figuresbound together in their Talismans. For example, intheHeptangle for Netzach, the Heptagon and the twoforms of the Heptagram shouldbe united in the sameTalisman, the extremities of the angles coinciding.The Endekangle is attributed to the Qlippoth, theDodekangle to Zodiacal Forcesin Malkuth. Ketherhath the Primum Mobile, Chokmah the Sphere of theZodiac incommand, and Malkuth that of the elements.And many other meanings are bound together in thelineal figures besides thosewhich are given in this book.Two or more different lineal figures may beboundtogether in the same Talisman,The Triangle is the only lineal figure into which allsurfaces can be reduced,for every Polygon can be di-vided into triangles by drawing lines from itsanglesto its centre; and the triangle is the first and simplestof all linealfigures. Tt refers to the Triad operating inall things, to the Three SupernalSephiroth and toBinah, the Third Sephirah, in particular.Among the Planets it is especially referred to Saturn,and among the Elements toFire, and, as the colour of<89> 'Saturn is black, and that of Fire red, the black Trianglewill represent Saturn,and the red, Fire.The Three Angles also symbolise the three alchemicalPrinciples of Nature: Salt,Sulphur and Mercury.The Square is an important lineal figure, whichnaturally represents stabilityand equation. It includesthe idea of surface and superficial measurement. Itre-fers to the Quarternary in all things, and to the Tetradof the Holy Name YHVHoperating through the fourElements of Fire, Water, Air and Earth. It isallottedto Chesed, the 4th Sephirah, and among the Planets toJupiter. And asrepresenting the Four Elements, itrepresents their ultimation in the MaterialForm.The Pentangle can be traced in two ways: reflectedfrom every second point, whenit is called the Pentagon;and reflected from every third point when it iscalledthe Pentagram. The Pentangle as a whole is referred tothe Fifth Sephirah,Geburah, The Pentagon naturallyrepresents the power of the Pentad, operating inNatureby the dispersal of the Spirit and the four Elementsthrough it.The Pentagram with a single point upwards is calledthe “Sign of the Microcosm,”and is a good symbol,representing man with his arms and legs extendedadoring hisCreator, and especially the dominion of theSpirit over the four Elements, andconsequently ofreason over matter.But with the single point downwards it is a very evilsymbol. The Head of theGoat, or Demon’s Head, rep-resenting the abasement of reason beneath theblindforces of matter, the elevation of anarchy above order,and of conflictingforces driven by chance above God.It represents the concentrated force of the Spirit andthe four Elements governedby the five letters of theName of the Restorer of all things YHSHVH, and itisespecially attributed to the Planet Mars. It also showsthe Kerubim and theWheel of the Spirit.< 9° >It is a symbol of tremendous force, and of HEH, theletter of the Great SupernalMother AIMA.The Hexangle can be traced in two ways as a com-plete symbol: viz, reflectedfrom every 2nd point, whenit is called the Hexagon, and reflected from every3rdpoint when it is called the Hexagram. The Hexangleas a whole is referred tothe 6th Sephirah Tiphareth.The Hexangle naturally represents the powers oftheHexad operating in Nature, by the dispersal of the raysof the Planets, and ofthe Zodiac emanating from theSun. The number of degrees of a great circle cutoffbetween its angles is sixty, forming the astrologicalsextile aspect, powerfulfor good. It is not so consonantto the Sun nature as the Hexagram, andrememberthou, that the ‘Gon signifieth dispersion, distribution,and radiation ofa force; but the ’Gram concentration.Hence use thou the ’Gon for spreading, andthe ’Gramfor concentration and sealing; and when there is need,thou canstcompare, interpose and combine them; butthe ’Gon initiateth the whirl.The Hexagram with a single point uppermost iscalled the “Sign of the Macrocosm,”or greater world,because its six angles fitly represent the six days orperiodsof Creation evolved from the manifestation ofthe Triune; while its synthesisforms the seventh day,a period of rest, summed up in the hexagonal centre.It represents especially the concentrated force of thePlanets, acting throughthe Signs of the Zodiac, andthus sealing the Astral Image of Nature underthepresidency of the Sephiroth; and also the 7 Palaces ofthe same. It isespecially attributable to the Sun.It is a symbol of great strength and power, formingwith the Cross and thePentagram, a triad of potentand good symbols, which are in harmony witheachother.The Heptangle as a whole is referred to the 7thSephirah, Netzach.The Heptagon naturally represents the dispersal ofthe powers of the sevenplanets through the week, and< 91 >through the year. It alludes to the power of the Sep-tenary acting through allthings, as exemplified by theseven colours of the rainbow.The Heptagram reflected from every 3rd pointyieldeth 7 triangles at the apicesthereof; fitly repre-senting the Triad operating in each Planet, and thePlanetsthemselves in the week and the year.The Heptagram is the Star of Venus, and is especiallyapplicable to her nature.And as the Heptagram is the lineal figure of theSeven Planets, so is Venus as itwere their Gate orentrance, the fitting symbol of the Isis of Nature, andof theseven lower Sephiroth of the Bride.The Octangle as a whole is referred to the EighthSephirah, Hod. The Octanglenaturally represents thepower of the Ogdoad, and the Octagon showeth theOgdoadoperating in Nature by the dispersal of the raysof the Elements in their dualaspect under the presi-dency of the 8 letters of the name.The Octagram reflected from every 3rd point yielded8 triangles at the apicesthereof; fitly representing theTriad operating in each element in its dual form,i.e. ofPositive and Negative, under the powers of the NameYHVH ADONAI or as itis written bound togetherIAHDONHI.This Octagram reflected from every fourth point isthe Star of Mercury, and isespecially applicable to hisnature.It is further a potent symbol, representing thebinding together of theconcentrated Positive andNegative Forces of the Elements under the NameofIAHDONHI.And forget not that ADONAI is the key of YHVH.The Enneangle as a whole is referred to the 9thSephirah Yesod. It naturallyrepresenteth the power ofthe Ennead, and the Enneagon showeth theEnneadoperating in Nature by the dispersal of the rays of theseven Planets andof the Head and Tail of the Dragonof the Moon.< 92 >The Enneagram reflected from every 3rd point repre-senteth the Triple Ternaryoperating both in the 7Planets with the Caput and Cauda Craconis of theMoon, andwith the Alchemical principles counter-changed and interwoven.It is not so consonant with the Nature of Luna as theEnneagram reflected fromevery 5th Point.The Enneagram is the Star of Luna, and is especiallyapplicable to her nature. Itrepresents her as the ad-ministratrix to the Earth of the virtues of theSolarSystem under the Sephiroth.The Enneagram reflected from every fourth point iscomposed of three trianglesunited within a circle, andalludes to the Triple Ternary of the threealchemicalprinciples themselves. It is not so consonant with thenature of Lunaas the next Form.The Dekangle as a whole is referred to the TenthSephirah—Malkuth.The Dekangle naturally represents the power of theDekad, and the Dekagon showeththe Dekad operatingin nature by the dispersal of the rays of the 10Sephiroththerein. The number of degrees of a Great Circle cutoff between itsangles is 36, the half of the Quintileastrological aspect.The Dekagram reflected from every 3rd point isespecially consonant with Malkuth,and shows theTriad operating through the angle of the two Penta-gons within acircle, of which it is composed. It alludesto the combination of the threeAlchemical Principleswith the Spirit and the Four Elements in their PositiveandNegative form, under the presidency of the T enSephiroth themselves.The Dekagram reflected from every 5th point iscomposed of two Pentagrams withina circle. It showsthe operation of the duplicated Heh of the Tetragram-maton,and the concentration of the Positive and Nega-tive forces of the Spirit and ofthe four Elements underthe presidency of the potencies of the Five in Binah;<93 >the Revolutions of the Forces under Aimah the GreatMother,The Endekagram as a general rule is referred to theQlippoth: of its formshowever, the one reflected fromevery 4th point represents their restriction, andthere-fore it is not altogether to be classed with those thatrepresent theiroperations in Nature. The Endekanglenaturally represents the evil and imperfectnature ofthe Endekad, and the Endekagon represents the dis-persal of the elevencurses of Mount Ebal through theUniverse (Deut. XXVII).(Though they are paraphrased as 12 in the EnglishBible, in the Hebrew versionthey are paragraphed aseleven, two being classed together.)The Dodekangle as a general rule is referred to theZodiac, and naturallyrepresents the power of theDodekad.The Dodekagon shows the dispersal of the influenceof the Zodiac through nature,the Dodekagram itsconcentration. The number of degrees of a Great Circlecut offbetween its angles is 30, forming the weakastrological semi-Sextile aspect, goodin nature andoperation.< 94 >THE GRADE OF PHILOSOPHUSADDITIONAL LECTURE ON THE TATTWASOF THE EASTERN SCHOOL(Note: This paper dealing with the Hindu Tattwasystem was withdrawn fromcirculation in that branchof the Order of which I happened to be a member.Thecopy from which I have reproduced the followingwas properly labelled and datedAugust, 1894, and istherefore as clearly authoritative as any of the Orderpaperscould be, indicating that it was formally andofficially issued to all members ofthe grade of Philoso-phus. It has also been conveyed to me that theAmericantemples, under the Mathers and Brodie Innesjurisdiction, circulated thisdocument.As to whether it accords with the general content ofthe rest of the Order systemmust be left to the dis-crimination of the individual student. That ithasseveral points of value will be doubted by none, thoughfew will care tosubscribe to the paper in its entirety.Personally, I feel it to be definitely analien system,which touches the Order teaching in but very fewplaces. The mode ofskrying in the Spirit-vision usingthe Tattwa symbols is sound enough, and hasbeendescribed elsewhere. But other aspects suggest that thetwo systems are notlikely to mix particularly well.Some students who are familiar with early Theo-sophical literature will recall abook ‘‘Nature’s FinerForces, or the Science of Breath,” by Rama Prasad,and itmay occur to them that this Additional Lectureon the Tattwas 0/ the EasternSchool is in reality aprecis of that book. This has been observed by quiteanumber of the early Order people, and I understand< 95 >that because of this, and because of the fact that noacknowledgement of the bookwas made in the docu-ment, Fratre Sub Spe withdrew the document.I have decided to issue it here, with the other Ordermanuscripts, as it mayconvey for some minds a specialmessage which may be absent in the others. Inanyevent, it seems to me that I have no right to extirpatefrom an account ofOrder teaching a paper which wasconsidered highly important by some of theearlyOrder Adepti.—I.R.)General Observation. There are five Tattwas orPrinciples:1. Akasa—Ether.2. Vayu—the Aerial principle.3. Tejas—the Principle of Light and Heat.4. Apas—Watery Principle.5. Prithivi—the Earthly Principle.But the first Cause of these is the Great Controllerof all things, the OneLight, the Formless. From Himfirst came into appearance Ether; thence the Air,themotion producing Ether waves which causes Light andHeat, and so on in theabove order.The Yogi conies to know the principle of these fiveTattwas, their SukshmaSharira, but how? Further onyou will see how. The Astrologer who has noknowledgeof the Swara is as worthless as a man without a wife.It is the soulitself; it is the Swara, the Great Controllerof all, who creates, preserves, anddestroys, and causeswhatsoever is in this World. Experience and Traditionbothsay no knowledge is more precious than thisknowledge of the Swara. None elselays bare the work-ings of the machinery of this world, or the secretworkings ofthis world.By the power of Swara may be destroyed an enemy.Power, wealth, and pleasure, allthese can be com-manded by Swara. The beginner in our Science must be<9<5>pure and calm in mind and in thought, virtuous inactions, and having unmixedfaith in his spiritualteacher. He must be strong in his determination,andgrateful.Swara in the Body. Ten manifestations of this Swaraare in the body. But beforethe Neophyte is told this,he must gain a thorough knowledge of thenervoussystem. This is very important, and according to hisknowledge of thisscience, the Neophyte gains success.To give a rough outline of the parts we havechiefly todeal with in our endeavour to explain the elementarytreatise: Thereare ten principal nerves, this includesthe tubes, etc. It is in the tenmanifestations of Swarathat the ten so-called Vayus move. We mean by thistenforces which perform ten different functions. Thethree most important nerves arethe following, as thebeginner has only to deal with these:1. Ida—the left bronchus.2. Pingala—the right bronchus.3. Sushumna—in the middle.The ten Vayus are:1. Prana, in the breast.2. Apana, about the excretory organs.3. Samana, in the navel.4. Undana, middle of the throat.5. Vyana, pervading the whole body.6. Kurmana, the eyes, helping them open.7. Kirkala, in the stomach, producing hunger.8. Nag, whence comes vomiting.9. Devadatta, causes yawning.10. Dhananjaya, that which doth not leave thebody after death.These ten vayus, or forces, have their play in theten principal nerves, not onein each. They are theregulators of the body of man. If they go onworkingproperly, a man remains perfectly healthy; if not, dif-ferent kinds ofdiseases spring up.< 97 >A Yogi keeps them always working, and conse-quently diseases never come to him.The key to allthese nerves lies in the working of the Prana Vayu, orvitalprinciple drawing the air through the Ida, thePingala, and the Sushumna. Whenthe Air is drawnthrough the Ida it is felt coming out or going in throughtheleft nostril. When through the Pingala, in the rightnostril. When through theSushumna it is felt throughboth nostrils simultaneously. The air is drawn orfeltthrough either or both of the nostrils at certain ap-pointed times. Wheneverin any given time, the Breathgoes in and comes out of the wrong nostril it is asuresign some sort of disease is coming on.The Ida is sometimes called the Chandra Nadi, or theMoon Nerve. The Pingala, theSurya Nadi or Sunnerve. These are called, the former, the Chandra Swaraand thelatter the Surya Swara.The reason is that when the breath is in the Ida itgives coolness to the body,and that when in the Pin-gala it gives heat to the body. The Ancient Magi usedtosay the place of the Moon in the human body was inIda, and the Sun in Pingala.The Course of the Breath. The Lunar month, it iswell known, is divided into twoparts, the fortnight ofthe Waxing and the fortnight of the Waning. On thefirstfortnight, or the Bright Fortnight, just at Sunriseof the first day the Breathmust come into the leftnostril and must be so for three days sucessively. Atthebeginning of the 4th day the Breath must comethrough the right nostril and mustdo so for the threesucceeding days, when again the 7th day must beginwith theMoon breath, and so on in the same order.Thus we have said that such and suchdays begin withsuch and such a breath.But how long is our breath to remain in one nostril?For five Gharis, or 2 hours.Thus when the first day ofthe Bright fortnight begins with the Moon Breath,afterfive Gharis, the Sun Breath must set in, and this again< 98 >must change into the Moon Breath after the same in-terval of time. So on forevery day.Again, the first day of the dark fortnight must beginwith the Sun Breath, andproceed in the same way,changing after five Gharis and the three succeedingdays.It will be seen that all the days of the monthhave been divided into the Ida andthe Pingala. In theSushumna, the Swara flows only when it changes,either in itsnatural course or in certain other conditionsto be afterwards mentioned. This isthe course ofNature. But a Yogi commands Nature. He turns every-thing into hisown way. Rules for this will be given inthe proper place.COURSE OF THE TATTWASFor five Gharis, as we have above said, the breathflows through our nostrils. Inthese 5 Gharis, or twohour periods, the Tattwas have their course. In thefirstwe have Akasa, in the second Vayu, in the third Tejas,in the fourth Apas,in the fifth Prithivi. Thus in onenight and day, or 60 Gharis, we have twelvecourses ofthese 5 Tattwas each remaining one Ghari and return-ing again in twohours. There are again further fivesubdivisions of each Tattwa in a Ghari. Thus,Akasais subdivided into Akas-Akasa; Akas-Vayu; Akas-Tejas; Akas-Apas;Akas-Prithivi—and similarly withthe other four.How to know which of the Tattwas is at a certaintime in course, not merely by amathematical calcula-tion but with the certainty of an eye witness, is ofthegreatest importance in the practical part of this science.We shall come to itfurther on.The Ida. When the Breath is in Ida, that is in theleft Nostril, then only is itwell to perform the follow-ing actions. Stable works such as erecting abuilding,or the construction of a well or tank, going on a distantjourney,entering a new house, collection of things,giving gifts, marriage, making jewelsor clothes, takingmedicines and tonics, seeing a superior or master foranypurpose of trade, amassing of wealth, sowing of< 99 >seed in a field, negotiations, commencement of trade,seeing of friends, works ofcharity and faith, goinghome, buying of animals, doing work for the benefitofothers, placing money on security, singing, dancing,taking up abode in anyvillage or city, drinking ormaking water at the time of sorrow, pain, fever,etc.AH these acts should be done when the Swara is in Ida.It must however bekept in mind that the TattwasVayu and Tejas are to be excluded from theseactions,likewise Akasa.During the Tattwas Prithivi and Apas only, arethese actions to be done. In afever, the Yogi keeps hisChandra Swara going, and brings the Apas or WaterTattwain course, so the fever is all over in a very shorttime. How mastery is gainedover the Tattwas willcome further on.The Pingala. In the Surya Swara only, are the fol-lowing actions to be done.Reading and teaching hardand difficult subjects of knowledge, sexualintercourse,shipping, hunting, mounting a hill or fort, riding adonkey, camel orhorse, swimming over a powerfulstream or river, writing, painting, buying andselling,fighting with swords or hands, seeing a king, bathing,eating, shaving,bleeding, sleeping—and such like. Allthese secure success and health, as thecase may be, ifdone in the Surya Swara.The Sushumna. When the Breath comes not out ofboth nostrils at the same time, itis flowing in theSushumna. Nothing ought to be done under these con-ditions, foreverything turns out badly. The same isthe case when the Breath is now in oneand now in theother nostril. When this is the case, sit down and medi-tate uponor over the Sacred Hansa. This joining of theBreath is the only time for Sandha,meditation.NOTE. Zanoni secured success in gaming for Cetosaand overcame the effects of thepoisoned wine of thePrince di D ——— as follows. In the first place, hechanged his breath to the right nostril, and threw anenvelope of the AkasaTattwa over his antagonist, who< ioo >consequently became all empty, the money in gamingflowing towards the SuryaSwara. In the latter case hebrought the Water, Apas, Tattwa into course,directedit with the full force of his trained will towards thepoisoned wine, andconsequently the burning heat ofthe poison was counteracted for a very longtime, andbefore it could recover strength enough to act on thesystem, it wasthere no longer. S. R. M. D.THE TATTWASTo each of the five Tattwas a special colour has beenassigned. Akasa—Black;dark; or no colour reaily.Vayu—Green (blue by some ).Tej as—Red. Apas, Whiteorreally all colours. Prithivi—Yellow. It is by thesecolours that a practical manfinds on the spur of themoment which Tattwa is at the time in course.Besides,these Tattwas have different shapes and tastes. Thesefigures are seen bytaking a bright mirror and lettingthe breath fall upon it, as it comes out ofthe Nose. Thedivided part takes one of the following forms accordingto theTattwa then in course. Prithivi—a figure havingfour Angles. Apas, a half moon,or crescent. Tejas, tri-angular. Vayu, spherical. Akasa, oval like a humanear.To sum up their qualities:Prithivi—moves always in the middle of the Pathsof Air and Water.Apas—downwards, straight throughthe nose. Tejas—upwards. Vayu—obliquelytowardsthe right or left arm, as the case may be. Akasa—transversely always.Distance ofBreath below NaturalTattwaColourFormTasteNosePrinciplePrithiviYellowHaving 4AnglesSweet12 fingersBulkyApasWhite orall coloursHalf MoonAstringent16 fingersColdVayuGreen orBlueSphereAcid8 fingersAlways inmotionTejasRedTriangleHot tastessuch aspepper, etc.4 fingersHotAkasaBlack,Dark, orno colourHuman ear,oval, eggBitterUpwardsUniversallypervading< IOI >Tests of the Tattwas. For practice, let a man takefive little bullets orcounters coloured: red, yellow,green or blue, white or silver, and black. Andplace orcarry them in his pocket. Now let him close his eyes andtake one of themout of his pocket. The colour of thebullet will be that of the Tattwa then incourse. Whilststill keeping the eyes closed, let him see if the colour ofthebullet floats before them.He must not suppose he will be correct all at once.By and by the confusion willdisappear, and colourswell-defined, staying for the proper length of time,willbegin to come before him, and the colour of the bulletwill be the same asthat seen before his eyes. And thenhe will have gained the power of knowingwhich of theTattwas is in course, and can at pleasure find them.There is a particular method of concentrating themind and practising the eyesfor this purpose, whichwill come with practise.Let him ask any of his friends to imagine one of thefive colours, say a flower.He will only have to shuthis eyes to find the Tattwa then in course, and hecanastonish his friends by naming the colour. Again, if aman sitting amongst hisfriends finds the Vayu Tattwaset in, let him be sure that those of his friendswho arein perfect health and in a normal state both of bodyand mind, wish to goaway. Let him ask them to sayfrankly, and they will answer “yes.”In what way other Tattwas affect both the body andmind of man will be stated inanother place. Somehigher secrets are purposely reserved for those whosafely andhonestly pass the elementary stage. Whenthe man has reached the stage of findingat will any ofthe Tattwas, let him not imagine he has become perfect.If he goes on practising, his inward sight becomeskeener, and he will recognisethe five subdivisions ofthe Tattwas. On and on let him go with hismeditation,and innumerable shades of color will be recognised ac-cording to thedifferent proportions of the Tattwas.Whilst during these intervals he is tryingto distinguish< 102 >between the different shades of the colours, his workwill be for a time verytedious. We say tedious at first,because when the thousand shades of colourbecomefixed and defined in his eyes by perseverance andpractice, he will havebefore his eyes an everchangingprospect of colour of the most beautiful shades,andthis for a time will be sufficient food for his mind.To avoid the tediousness, let him meditate upon hisbreath, as is laid down inthe chapter of meditation ofthe Tattwas.Action to be done during the different Tattwas.Actions of a sedate and stablenature are those of thesort enumerated under the Chandra Swara, to be donewhenPrithivi the Earthy Principle is in course. Thoseof a fleeting nature, which areto be done and gonethrough very soon are to be done during Apas. Actionsof ahard nature, those in which a man has to makeviolent struggle to hold his own,are to be done duringTejas. If a Yogi wishes to kill a man he must try to dosowith the Vayu Tattwa. In the Akasa, nothing shouldbe done but meditation, asworks begun during thisalways end badly. Works of the above nature onlyprosperin the Tattwas specified; and those whoseactions prosper may see this byexperiment.MEDITATION AND MASTERY OVER THE TATTWASWe have previously given summary rules for distin-guishing the various coloursof the different Tattwaswhich are of great use to the beginner. But now wearegoing to explain the final method of mastering theTattwas, and of practising.This is a secret which wasonly imparted to the most promising Adepts of Yoga.Buta short practise will fully show the importantresults to be gained by thispractice.The student will by degrees become able to look intofuturity at will, and haveall the visible world beforehis eyes, and he will be able to command Nature.During the day, when the sky is clear, let him onceor twice for about an hour ortwo withdraw his mind< 103 >from all external things; and sitting on an easy chair,let him fix his eyes onany particular part of the bluesky, and go on looking at it without allowingthem totwinkle. At first he will see the waves of the water, thisis the wateryvapour in the atmosphere which sur-rounds the whole world. Some days later, asthe eyesbecome practised, he will see different sorts of buildingsand so on inthe air, and many other wonderful thingsas well. When the Neophyte reaches thisstage of prac-tise, he is sure of gaining success.After this he will see different sorts of mixed coloursof Tattwas in the sky,which will after a constant andresolute practice show themselves in their properandrespective colours.To test the truth of this, the Neophyte during thepractice should occasionallyclose his eyes and comparethe colour floating in the sky with that which heseesinwardly. When both are the same the operation isright. Other tests we havegiven before, and otherwonders resulting from this will of themselvespresentthemselves to the Yogi. This practice is to be done inthe daytime.For the night, let the student rise about two o’clockin the morning, wheneverything is calm, when there isno noise, and when the cold light of the starsbreatheholiness, and a calm rapture enters into the soul of man.Let him wash hishands, feet, the crown of his head,and the nape of his neck with cold water. Lethim puthis shin bones on the ground, and let the back of histhighs touch hiscalves, and let him put his hands uponhis knees, the fingers pointing towardsthe body. Lethim now fix his eyes on the tip of his nose. To avoidthistediousness, he must always, especially during themeditation, meditate upon hisbreath, coming in andgoing out.Besides the above, this has many other advantagesgiven elsewhere. It may here besaid that by constantpractice of this meditation over his breath, the man istodevelop two distinct syllables in his thought. It is< 104 >evident that when a man draws his breath in, a soundis produced which isimitated in Han. When out, thesound Sa. By constant practice, the going in andcom-ing out of the breath is so much connected with thesesounds that without anyeffort the mind understandsHan-sa with the production of these sounds. Thuswesee that one full breath makes Han-Sa, this is the Nameof the Ruler of theUniverse, together with his powers.They are exerted in the working out ofnaturalphenomena. At this stage of perfection, the Yogi shouldcommence asfollows:Getting up at two or three in the morning, andwashing himself in theaforementioned manner, let himknow and fix his mind upon the Tattwa then incourse.If the Tattwa in course be then Prithivi, let him thinkof it as somethinghaving 4 angles, a good yellow col-our, sweet smelling, small in body, andtaking away alldiseases. Let him at the same time repeat the wordLAM. It is veryeasy to imagine such a thing.If it be the Apas Tattwa, let him imagine somethingof the shape and brightnessof the half moon, puttingdown heat and thirst, and that he is immersed intheocean of Water. Let him at that time repeat the wordVAM.If the Tattwa be Tejas, let him imagine it as some-thing triangular in shape,shedding a red glare, con-suming food and drink, burning away everything,andthus making itself unbearable. At the same time lethim repeat RAM.If the Tattwa be Vayu, let him imagine it as some-thing of a spherical shape, ofa colour Green, or Blue,like the green leaves of a tree after rain, andcarryinghim with a mighty power away from the ground andflying in space like thebirds. And let him repeat thesyllable PAM.If the Tattwa be Akasa, let him imagine it as havingno shape but giving forth abrilliant light, and let himrepeat the syllable HAM.By diligent practice, these syllables uttered by the< 105 >tongue of a Yoga become inseparable from the Tattwas.When he repeats any ofthese, the special Tattwaappears with as much force as he may will, and thusitis that a Yogi can cause whatever he likes, lightning,rain, wind, and soforth.CURE OF DISEASESEvery disease causes the breath to flow out of thewrong nostril, and the wrongTattwa to come intocourse. When the breath therefore is restored to thepropernostril, and the proper Tattwa has been broughtinto course, let not anyoneexpect that all that isnecessary has been done. If the disease be obstinateandthe attack a very violent one, the man will have topersevere in battle a verylong time before he conquers.If a beginner cannot succeed very soon, let him aidthe power of his breath by asuitable medicine, andSwara will be restored very soon.It may be noticed that the Chandra Swara is gen-erally the best for alldiseases. Its flow is an indicationof the soundness of Health. In cold, cough,and otherdiseases, this breath ought to flow.Of the Tattwas as well as of the Swaras, no onecauses pain if it goes onproperly. In this state it oughtnot generally to be meddled with. But whenanyonegains an undue predominance and causes diseases, itought to be at oncechanged. Experience shows thatthe Apas and the Prithivi Tattwas are the onlyonesgenerally good for health, and indeed, the fact thatduring the course of theApas Tattwa the breath isfelt 16 fingers breadth below the nose, and duringthePrithivi 12 fingers, argues at those times a more soundand powerful workingof the functions of the body,than when it is felt only 8, or 4, or nofinger-breadthbelow the nose.Akasa therefore is the worst for health, and in astate of ill-health, a man willgenerally find in course,either Akasa, Vayu, or Tejas.< 106 >Let him therefore, when need be, proceed in thefollowing manner. After havingchanged his Breath,from the wrong nostril to the proper one, generally theLeft,and pressing the opposite side by a cushion sothat it may not change again, letthe man sit on aneasy chair and bind his left thigh a little above theknee jointwith his handkerchief. In a short time, whoselength, varies inversely as thedeficiency of practice,and directly as the violence of the disease, he willper-ceive that the Tattwa changes to the one immediatelybelow it and so on; andthen the next, and so forth. Ifhe be an acute observer of the conditions of hisbody,he will perceive that slowly his mind is becoming moreand more easy. Lethim tighten his bandage still moreif need be. When at last he reaches thePrithivi Tattwa,he will find in the state of his health a great change forthebetter. Let him preserve in this state, or, stillbetter, the Apas Tattwa forsome time, and return to itoccasionally for some days, even after the attacksofthe disease have ceased. He will no doubt be cured.FORECAST OF FUTURITYAlthough a Yogi obtains the power of knowingeverything that is, has been, or isto be, beyond thereach of the senses, yet generally he becomes indifferenttosuch knowledge, forgetting himself, as he does, inhis eternal presence beforethe Light which breathesbeauty into all we see in the world. We shallthereforerepresent him here revealing if not all his knowledgeof futurity, onlyon questions being put to him byothers. But our Neophytes may as well put theques-tions themselves, and then answer them according tothe laws here laid down.When a man comes and says to the Yogi that he hasa question to ask, let him:(a) see which of the Tattwas is in course. If theTattwa be Prithivi, thequestion is aboutsome root, something belonging to the vege-< io7>table kingdom, or something in which theEarthy nature is predominant.(b) If it be Apas, it is about some Life, birth,death, etc.(c) If Tejas, the question is of metals, gain, orloss, etc.(d) If Akasa, he means to ask nothing.(e) If Vayu, about some journey.These are but elementary things. The practical Yogiwho can distinguish betweenthe mixture of theTattwas can name the particular things.Now let him see through which of his nostrils theBreath is flowing, which is thefortnight then in courseof passing, which the days, and what direction ofhim-self, the enquirer.If the breath comes through the Left nostril, tosecure complete success in thework which makes thesubject of the question, and which will be of thesortspecified under Ida, he must have the following co-incidences. The fortnightmust be bright, that is of theWaxing Moon. The day must be even, 2, 4, 6, andsoon; the direction must be East or North. If these thingscoincide the man willget what he wants.Again, if the Surya and Swara coincide with thedark fortnight, the day odd, thedirection South andWest, the same result may be predicted but not sothoroughly.The action will be of the sort prescribedunder Pingala.According as any of these do not coincide, will thesuccess be more or lessimperfect. It must be remem-bered that the breath at the time must not beflowingthrough the wrong nostril. This has many bad conse-quences; we only justtouch the subject.Of the Wrong Swara. If at the commencement ofthe day the wrong Swara arises, theLuna for the Solar,and vice versa, a man may expect something wrong.If ithappens the first day, there is sure to be somesort of mental uneasiness. If thesecond, some loss of< 108 >wealth. If the third, a journey will come. If the fourth,some dear object willbe destroyed. If the fifth, loss ofkingdom. If the sixth, loss of everything. Ifthe seventh,illness and pain sure to come. If the eighth, death.If the Sun breath flows in the morning and at noonand the Moon in the evening, asad discomforture willbe the result, the reverse being a sign of Victory.If a man, going to travel, raises his foot which co-incides in direction withthe empty nostril at the timebeing, he will not get what he desires from histravels.< 109 >BOOK EIGHTDIVINATIONG EOMAN CYCHAPTER ONEThe figures of Geomancy consist of various group-ings of odd and even points in4 lines. Of these thegreatest possible number of combinations is 16. There-forethese sixteen combinations of odd and even pointsarranged on four lines are thesixteen figures ofGeomancy. These are again classed under the headsof theElements, the Signs of the Zodiac, and thePlanets ruling these. Two figures areattributed to eachof the Seven Planets, while the remainder are attrib-uted toCaput and Cauda Draconis—the Head andTail of the Dragon, or the North and SouthNodes ofthe Moon. Furthermore, to each Planet and Signcertain ruling Genii areattributed, as shown on pagesno and 11 r.CHAPTER TWORoughly speaking, the mode of obtaining the firstfour Geomantic figures, fromwhich the remainder ofthe Divination is calculated, is by marking down atrandomon paper with a pencil held by a loosely tensedhand 16 lines of points ordashes, without counting thenumber placed in each line during the operation.Andall the time thinking fixedly of the subject of thedemand.

Of fines 5 to 8 the second figure; of fines9 to 12the third; of fines 13 to 16, the 4th figure, as shown inthe diagram onpage 113,The symbol of a Pentagram either within or withouta circumscribed circle shouldbe made at the top of thepaper on which the dashes are made. The paperitselfshould be perfectly clean and should have never beenpreviously used forany other purpose. If a circle beused with the Pentagram, it should be drawnbeforethe latter is described. The Pentagram should alwaysbe of the “invoking”type, as described in the Penta-gram Ritual. Since the Pentagram concerns theelementof Earth, it should therefore be drawn beginning atthe top descending tothe lower left hand point, care-fully closing the angle at the finish. Withinthe centreof the Pentagram, the Sigil of the “Ruler” to which thematter of thequestion specially refers, should be placed.If the question be of the Nature of Saturn,, such asagriculture, sorrow, death,etc., the Sigil of Zazel shouldbe placed in the Pentagram. If of Jupiter,concerninggood fortune, feasting, church preferment, etc., theSigil of Hismael.If of Mars, war, fighting, victory, etc.,the Sigil of Bartzabel. If of the Sun,power, magistracy,success, etc., the Sigil of Sorath. If of Venus, love,music,pleasure, etc., the Sigil of Kedemel. If of Mer-cury, such as science, learning,knavery, etc., the Sigilof Taphthartharath, etc. If of travelling, fishing,etc.,under Luna, then the Sigil of Chasmodai. In the dia-gram appended the Sigilof Hismael is employed.During the marking down of the points, the attentionshould be fixed upon theSigil within the Pentagram,and the mind should carefully consider thequestionproposed.

A pencil istherefore preferable to a penfor this purpose—unless, of course, a veryreliablefountain pen is employed. It is practically more con-venient to draw orrule four lines across the paperbeforehand to mark off the space for such fourlinescomposing a Geomantic Figure as shown on the pre-vious page. The first fourGeomantic figures formeddirectly from the 16 lines of points are called TheFourMothers. It is from them that the remaining figuresnecessary to complete theGeomantic scheme of direc-tion are derived.These should now be placed in a row from right toleft, for the greaterconvenience of the necessary calcu-lations—though much practice may render thisun-necessary.

Theseagain correspond to the 12Astrological Houses ofHeaven, with which they will later on be compared.CHAPTER THREEFor the greater assistance of the Diviner in forminga judgment upon the generalcondition of the schemeof 12 figures thus far obtained, it is usual todeducefrom them three other subsidiary figures. These threeare of lessimportance than the twelve previous figures,and are not to be considered at allin the light of com-ponent figures of the scheme, but only as aids to thegeneraljudgment. These other figures are known as theRight Witness, Left Witness, andthe Judge.The two witnesses are without significance in thedivination, except as they arethe roots from which thefigure known as the Judge is derived. The Right Wit-nessis formed from the 9th and 10th figures by com-paring the points in the mannerbefore shown in theformation of the Resultants. That is the correspondinglinesof points in the two figures are compared together,and the addition, whether oddor even, comprises thepoints of the Witness. The Left Witness representsthecombination in a similar manner of the nth and 12thfigures. The Judge againis formed in precisely the sameway from the Two Witnesses, and is therefore asyn-thesis of the whole figure. If he be good, the figure isgood and thejudgment will be favourable; and viceversa. From the nature of the formation ofthe 15thfigure, the Judge, it should always consist of an evennumber of points,and never of odd. That is, in addingtogether the four lines of points comprisingthe Judge,the result should be an even number. For if the Judgewere a figure ofodd points it would show that a mistakehad been made somewhere in thecalculations.The Reconciler is a 16th figure sometimes used foradding the Judgment bycombining the Judge with theFigure in the Particular Llouse signifying thethingdemanded. Thus, in the preceding scheme, the Judge< 120 >formed is Populus, and the Second Figure, beingAmissio, their combination alsoyields Amissio.In order to discover where © The Part of Fortunewill fall, add together all thepoints of the first twelvefigures. Divide that number by twelve, and placethePart of Fortune with the figure answering to the re-mainder. If there is noremainder it will fall on the 12thfigure. The Part of Fortune is a symbol ofready money,money in cash belonging to the Querent, and is of thegreatestimportance in ail questions of money.CHAPTER FOURThe following is the signification of the 12 Houses ofHeaven, in brief:First House(Ascendant)Second HouseThird HouseFourth HouseFifth HouseSixth HouseSeventh HouseEighth HouseNinth HouseTenth HouseEleventh HouseLife, health, querent, etc.Money, property, personal worth.Brothers, sisters, news, short jour-neys, etc.Father, landed property, inheritance.The grave, the end of the matter.Children, pleasure, feasts, specula-tion.Servants, sickness, uncles and aunts,small animals.Love, marriage, husband or wife.Partnerships and associations, pub-lic enemies,law suits.Deaths, wills, legacies; pain, anxiety.Estate of deceased.Long journeys, voyages.

A figure is, therefore,strongest when in what is called its house, verystrongwhen in its exaltation, strong in its Triplicity, veryweak in its Fall;weakest of all in its detriment. Afigure is in its fall when in a House oppositeto that ofits exaltation, and in its detriment when opposite to itsown house.The Geomantic figures, being attributed to thePlanets and Signs, are dignifiedaccording to the ruleswhich obtain in Astrology. That is to say they followthedignities of their Ruling Planets, considering theTwelve Houses of the scheme asanswering to theTwelve Signs. Thus, the Ascendant or First Houseanswers toAries, the Second House to Taurus, theThird House to Gemini, and so on to theTwelfthanswering to Pisces. Therefore the figures of Mars willbe strong in theFirst House, but weak in the SeventhHouse, and so forth.Na me ofSignRulerEle-mentExalta^tionFallDetri-mentStrongAriesMarsFireSunSaturnVenusJupiterTaurusVenusEarthLuna—MarsJupiterGeminiMercuryAir——JupiterSaturnCancerLunaWaterJupiterMarsSaturnMercuryLeoSolFireSaturnMarsVirgoMercuryEarthMercuryVenusJupiterSaturnLibraVenusAirSaturnSolMarsJupiterScorpioMarsWater—LunaVenusSunSagittariusJupiterFire——MercuryVenusCapricornSaturnEarthMarsJupiterLunaMercuryAquariusSaturnAir——Sol—,PiscesJupiterWaterVenusMercuryMercury—Caput Draconis is strong in the dignities of Jupiterand Venus.Cauda Draconis is strong in the dignities of Saturnand Mars.< 132 >CHAPTER SEVENRemember always that if the figures Rubeus orCauda Draconis fall in theAscendant, or first house,the figure is not fit for Judgment and should bede-stroyed without consideration. Another figure for thequestion should not beerected before at least two hourshave elapsed.Your figure being thoroughly arranged as on a Mapof the heavens, as previouslyshown, note first to whatHouse the demand belongs. Then look for the Wit-nessesand the Judge, as to whether the latter is favour-able or otherwise, and in whatparticular way. Put thisdown.Note next what Figure falls in the House required.Also whether it passes orsprings—that is whether it isalso present in any other House or Houses.Theseshould also be considered—as for example in a questionof money stolen, ifthe figure in the second House bealso found in the sixth House, it might alsoshow thatthe thief was a servant in the house.Then look in the Table of Figures in the Houses andsee what the Figure signifiesin the special House underconsideration. Put this down also. Then look intheTable for the strength of the figures in that House.Following this, apply theastrological rule of aspectsbetween houses, noting what houses are Sextile,Quin-tile, Square, Trine, etc. Write the “Good” one side andthe “Evil” on theother, noting also whether thesefigures also are “strong” or “weak,” “friendly”or “un-friendly” in nature to the figure in the House required.Note that inlooking up the aspects between houses,there are two directions, Dexter andSinister. TheDexter aspect is that which is contrary to the naturalsuccession ofthe houses; the Sinister is the reverse.The Dexter aspect is more powerful thanthe Sinister.Then add the meaning of the figure in the FourthHouse, which will signify theend of the matter. It mayalso assist you to form a Reconciler Figure from the< 133 >Figure in the house required and the Judge, notingwhat figure results andwhether it harmonises witheither or both by nature. Now consider all youhavewritten down, and according to the balance of “good”and “evil” therein formyour final judgment.Consider also in “money” matters where the Part ofFortune falls.For example, let us consider the figure previously setup and form a judgment for“Loss of money in busi-ness” therefrom,Populus is the Judge, and we find that in questionsof money, which concern theSecond House, it signifies“medium good.” The question as a whole is of thenatureof the Second House, where we find Career, Wethen discover that Career here is“evil,” as showingobstacles and delays. The Part of Fortune is in theAscendantveith Amissio, signifying loss throughQuerent’s own mistake, and loss throughQuerent’s self.The figure of Amissio springs into no other house,therefore this does not affectthe question. “Career” inthe Second House is neither “strong” nor “weak”;itsstrength for evil is medium. The figures Sextile andTrine of the Second areConjunctio, Fortuna Major,Fortuna Minor, and Acquisitio, all “good” figures,help-ing the matter and “friendly” in nature. This signifieswell intentionedhelp of friends. The figures square andopposition of the Second are FortunaMinor. Conjunc-tio, Fortuna Major which are not hostile to Career,thereforeshowing “opposition not great.”The figure in the Fourth House is Fortuna Majorwhich shows a good end but withanxiety. Let us nowform a Reconciler between the figure of the SecondHouse whichis Career and the Judge, Populus, whichproduces Career again, a sympatheticfigure, but de-noting delay—delay, but helping the Querent’s wishes.Now let usadd all these together:1. Medium.2. Evil and Obstacles, delay.< 134 >3* Loss through querent’s self.4. Strength for evil, medium only.5. Well-intentioned aid of friends.6. Not much opposition from enemies.7. Ending—good; but with anxiety.8. Delay, but helping Querent’s wishes.And we can formulate the final judgment:That the Querent’s loss in business has been prin-cipally owing to his ownmismanagement. That hewill have a long and hard struggle, but will meetwith helpfrom friends. That his obstacles willgradually give way, and that after muchanxietyhe will eventually recoup himself for his formerlosses.SUMMARY OF STAGES IN GEOMANTIC DIVINATION:1. If Rubeus or Cauda Draconis in Ascendant destroythe figure.2. Note the House to which the question belongs. Seeif the figure there springsinto another house.3. Form the Judge from the two witnesses.4. Part of Fortune—that is, if money question.5. See if Figure in House concerned is ‘‘strong” or“weak.” If it pass or springinto any other house.6. See figures Sextite and Trine, Square and Opposition.7. Friendly or unfriendly.8. Note the figure in Fourth House, signifying the endor outcome.9. Form a Reconciler from Judge and the figure inHouse to which the demandappertains.(Note: Although this whole instruction on Geoman-cy describes the process asbeing performed throughouton paper with a pencil, yet it should berememberedthat this description is but a makeshift for the con-venience of theunenterprising student. By definition,Geomancy is a scheme of divination by andthroughthe Element of Earth. Therefore the student withinitiative, to whom thismethod appeals, should actaccordingly. Let him therefore prepare a quantity of< 135 >clean and dry black earth—or desert sand, if possible,but not that taken fromthe sea-shore—and also a trayor wooden box which is to be reserved solely forthepurpose of housing this consecrated earth. The outsideof the box might bedecorated with sigils or symbolicpaintings in harmony with the general idea,andpainted in the four Malkuth colours. A small slenderwand, pointed to makeclean sharp holes or markings,should be prepared since it will be with thisinstrumentthat the sixteen lines of dots or holes in the earth willbe made. Whenall has been duly prepared, the box ofEarth should be given a ceremonialconsecration; thestudent who has studied the general formulae of conse-crationwill know exactly what should be done.In actual divinatory practice, the invoking EarthPentagram enclosing the Sigil,and the sixteen rows ofdots from which the Four Mothers will be formed, canbequickly marked on the Earth with this special wandor pointer. Then, forconvenience’ sake, the studentcan transfer these four primary figures to paper,calcu-late the remaining eight figures to be placed on theMap and proceed tojudgment exactly as this instruc-tion lays down. Experience shows that theactual useof Earth as a means of forming the fundamentalmagical link between theinitiated diviner and theGeomantic divinatory Genii is psychologically morevalidand effectual than with paper and pencil, besidesyielding far more satisfactoryresults.—I.

The Four Aces are said to be placedonthe North Pole of the Universe, wherein they revolve,governing its revolution,and ruling as the connectinglink between Yetsirah and the Material PlaneofUniverse.I. The Root of the Powers of Fire.ACE OF WANDSA white radiating angelic Hand issuing from Cloudsand grasping a heavy Clubwhich has three branchesin the colours and with the Sigils of the Scales.Theright and left hand branches end respectively in threeFlames and the centreone in four Flames, thus yielding1 en the number of the Sephiroth. Two andTwentyleaping Flames or Yods surround it, answering to thePaths of these. Threefall below the right branch forAleph Mem and Shin. Seven above the centralbranchfor the double letters. And between it and that on theright, twelve—sixabove and six below—about the lefthand Branch. The whole is a great and FlamingTorch.It symbolises Force, strength, rush, vigour, energy, andit governsaccording to its nature various works andquestions. It implies natural asopposed to InvokedForce.< 142 >II. The Root of the Powers of the Waters.ACE OF CUPS OR CHALICESA Radiant white Angelic Hand issuing from cloudsand supporting on the palmthereof a cup, resemblingthat of the Stolistes. From it rises a fountain ofclearand glistening Water; and spray falling on all sidesinto clear calm waterbelow, in which grow Lotus andwater lilies. The great letter Heh of theSupernalMother is traced in the spray of the Fountain. It sym-bolises Fertility,Productiveness, Beauty, Pleasure,Happiness, etc.III. The Root of the Powers of Air,ACE OF SWORDSA white radiating Angelic Hand, issuing from clouds,and grasping the hilt of aSword, which supports awhite radiant celestial Crown from which depend, ontheright, the olive branch of Peace, and on the left,the Palm branch of suffering.Six Vaus fall fromits point.It symbolises invoked as contrasted with naturalForce; for it is the Invocationof the Sword. Raisedupward, it invokes the Divine Crown of SpiritualBrightness.But reversed it is the invocation of demoni-ac force, and becomes a fearfullyevil symbol. It repre-sents therefore very great power for good or evil,butinvoked. And it also represents whirling force, andstrength through trouble.It is the affirmation of justice,upholding Divine authority; and it may becometheSword of Wrath, Punishment and Affliction.IV, The Root Powers of the Earth.ACE OF PENTACLESA white radiant Angelic Hand, holding a branch ofa rose Tree, whereon is a largePentacle, formed of fiveconcentric circles. The innermost Circle iswhite,charged with a red Greek cross. From this white centre12 rays, also white,issue. These terminate at the cir-< 143 >cumference, making the whole something like an astro-logical figure of theHeavens.It is surmounted by a small circle, above which is alarge Maltese Cross, andwith two white wings; fourroses and two buds are shewn. The hand issueth fromtheclouds as in the other three cases. It representethmateriality in all senses,good and evil, and is thereforein a sense illusionary. It shows material gain,labour,power, wealth, etc.The Sixteen Court or Royal Cards.THE FOUR KINGSThe Four Kings or Figures mounted on Steedsrepresent the Yod forces of the Namein each suit, theRadix, Father, and commencement of Material Forces.A Force inwhich all the others are implied and of whichthey form the development andcompletion. A forceswift and violent in action, but whose effect soonpassesaway, and therefore symbolised by a figure on a steedriding swiftly, andclothed in complete armour.Therefore is the knowledge of the scale of the Kingso necessary for thecommencement of all magicalworking.TIIE FOUR QUEENSAre seated upon Thrones, representing the Forces ofHeh of the Name in each suit,the Mother, and bringerforth of material Force, a Force which develops,andrealises the Force of the King. A force steady and un-shaken, but not rapidthough enduring. It is thereforesymbolised by a figure seated upon a Throne butalsoclothed in armour.THE FOUR PRINCESThese Princes are figures seated in chariots, and thusborne forward. Theyrepresent the Vau Forces of theName in each suit; the Mighty son of the King,andthe Queen, who realises the Influence of both scales ofForce. A prince, theson of a King and Queen, yet aPrince of Princes, and a King of Kings. AnEmperor,< 144 >whose effect is at once rapid (though not so swift asthat of a king) andenduring (though not as steadfastas that of a Queen). It is therefore symbolisedby afigure borne in a chariot, and clothed with armour. Yetis his powerillusionary, unless set in motion by hisFather and Mother.THE FOUR PRINCESSESAre the Knaves of the Tarot Pack. The FourPrincesses or Figures of Amazonsstanding firmly bythemselves, neither riding upon horses, nor seateduponThrones, nor borne on Chariots. They represent theforces of Heh Final of theName in each suit, complet-ing the influences of the other scales. The mightyandpotent daughter of a King and Queen: a princesspowerful and terrible, A Queenof Queens, an Empress,whose effect combines those of the King, Queen andPrince.At once violent and permanent, she is there-fore symbolised by a figure standingfirmly by itself,only partially draped and having but little armour.Yet herpower existeth not save by reason of the others,and then indeed it is mighty andterrible materially,and is the Throne of the Forces of the Spirit. Woeuntowhomsoever shall make war upon her when thusestablished!The Sphere of Influence of the Court Cardsof the Tarot Pack.The Princesses rule over the Four Parts of the Celes-tial Heavens which liearound the North Pole, andabove the respective Kerubic Signs of the Zodiac,andthey form the Thrones of the Powers of the Four Aces.The Twelve Cards, 4 Kings, 4 Queens, and 4 Princes,rule the Dominions of theCelestial Heavens betweenthe realm of the Four Princesses and the Zodiac, asishereafter shewn. And they, as it were, link togetherthe signs.< 145 >WANDSV.

Above his Helmet, upon hiscuirass, and onhis shoulder pieces and buskins he bears,as a crest, a winged black Horse’shead. He grasps aClub with flaming ends, somewhat similar to that inthe symbolof the Ace of Wands, but not so heavy, andalso the Sigil of his scale is shewn.Beneath the rushing feet of his steed are wavingflames of Fire. He is active,generous, fierce, sudden andimpetuous.

This is the PlanetMarswhich is allotted the last decan of Pisces and first ofAries, because thelong cold of the winter requires agreat energy to overcome it and initiatespring.The beginning of the decanates is from the RoyalKing Star of the Heart of theLion, the great star CorLeonis, and therefore is the first decanate that ofSaturnin Leo.Here follow the general meanings of the smalt cardsof the Suits, as classifiedunder the Nine Sephirothbelow Kether.CHOKMAHThe Four Deuces symbolise the Powers of the Kingand Queen; first uniting andinitiating the Force, hutbefore the Prince and Princess are thoroughlybroughtinto action. Therefore do they generally imply the ini-tiation andfecundation of a thing.EINAHThe Four Threes, generally, represent the realisationof action owing to thePrince being produced.

Definite accomplishment, and carry-ing out of a matter.< 156 >NETZACIIThe Four Sevens. Generally shows a force, trans-cending the material plane, andis like unto a crownwhich is indeed powerful but requireth one capable ofwearingit. The sevens then show a possible resultwhich is dependent on the action thentaken. Theydepend much on the symbols that accompany them.HODThe Fours Eights. Generally show solitary success;i.e., success in the matterfor the time being, but notleading to much result apart from the thing itself.YESODThe Four Nines. Generally they show very greatfundamental force. Executivepower, because they reston a firm basis, powerful for good or evil.MALKUTHThe Four Tens. Generally show fixed culminatedcompleted Force, whether good orevil. The matterthoroughly and definitely determined. Similar to theforce of theNines, but ultimating it, and carryingit out.These are the meanings in the most general sense.< 157 >Here follow the more particular descriptions andmeanings.

Althoughthe Angels of the Schem ha-Mephoresch havebeenlinked with the Decanates, yet their dominion is farmore exalted, extended,and important than this wouldat first sight seem to imply. In all of this I havenotonly transcribed the symbolism, but have tested,studied, compared, andexamined it both cjairvoyantlyand in other ways. The result of these has been toshowme how absolutely correct the symbolism of the Book Tis, and how exactly itrepresents the occult Forces ofthe Universe.S. Riochail Ma Dhream.< 176 >TAROT DIVINATIONThis form is especially applicable to Divinationconcerning the ordinary materialevents of daily life.It is a mode of placing the cards based upon thescheme of the dominion of theTarot Symbols. Themore rigidly correct and in harmony with the schemeof theUniverse is any form of Divination, so much themore is it likely to yield acorrect and reliable answerto the enquirer. For then and then only is there afirmlink, and bond of union, established between it and theOccult forces ofNature. The moment the correct cor-respondence of the Symbols employed ceases tobeobserved, the link between them and the inner Occultforces is strained, and insome cases broken. For thiscause, therefore, is it that the same mode ofDivinationwill sometimes yield a true and sometimes false answer,and at othertimes a partly true and partly false;because the correspondences are either notrigidlyobserved or else made use of by an ignorant and un-initiated person.Therefore the Diviner should enter upon the Divina-tion with a mind clear andunprejudiced, neitherdisturbed by anger, fear, nor love, and with asoundknowledge of the correspondences of the symbols whichhe employs. Also heshould be able to employ his clair-voyant and intuitive faculties therein whennecessaryand should avoid as much as possible a warped orstrained decision. Alsoit is not well to divine repeatedlyconcerning the same matter; and the Divinershouldalso recognise that even the material occult forces donot act as theinstruments of a blind fatality, but ratherin accordance with the will of themore spiritual powerswhich are behind them.Also it may be well for the Diviner to put on hisinsignia, and make over thepack any invoking hexa-gram or pentagram, either with the hand alone, or with< 177 >convenient magical instruments. And it may also beadvisable in some instances toinvoke an elementalforce consonant with the matter, to aid in thedivination.And let it not be forgotten that in working with thelesser magical implementsall the four should be athand, even though only one be actually employed. Forifthis be not done, it will give undue force to the suitcorresponding to theElement invoked, and instead ofbeing an aid in the matter, it will be ahindrance tocorrect reading.(A formula which may be found useful to assistconcentration, and to formulate alink between theDiviner and the intelligences referred to the Tarot, isto takethe pack in the left hand, and with the righthand hold the Wand or any lesserinstrument. Thensay: “In the divine name IAO, I invoke Thee thouGreat Angel HRUwho art set over the operations ofthis Secret Wisdom. Lay thine hand invisiblyon theseconsecrated cards of art, that thereby I may obtain trueknowledge ofhidden things, to the glory of the ineffableName. Amen.”—I.R.)THE OPENING OF THE KEYThe mode of performing the Divination called “TheOpening of the Key” is by fiveconsecutive operationsof laying out the cards, they having been previouslywellshuffled, and, in addition in the first and fourthcases, having been cut aswell, and in a certain manner.These five operations answer respectively, thefirst tothe Dominion of the Four Princesses under the presi-dency of the FourAces; the Second to that of theKings, Queens and Princes, referred to theTwelveHouses; the Third to that of the Twelve Keys attrib-uted to the Signs; theFourth to that of the smallercards answering to the 36 Decanates; and the Fifthandlast to the rule of the Sephiroth in the CelestialHeavens.< 178 >These are five distinct operations, consecutively exe-cuted from the mode ofOperation called the “Openingof the Key,” which, as has been before said, isespeciallyapplicable to the daily events of life. The first of thesemethodsshows the opening of the matter as it thenstands. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, itsconsecutive development,and the 5th its termination.Before commencing the Divination, one of the six-teen court cards should beselected to represent thesignificator of the enquirer, and should answer asnearlyto his description.WANDS generally — very fair-haired and red-haired persons with fair complexion.CUPS generally—moderately fair persons.SWORDS generally—dark persons.PENTACLES generally—very dark persons.KINGS—Generally men,QUEENS—Generally women.PRINCES (KNIGHTS)—Generally young men.PRINCESSES (KNAVES) — Generally youngwomen.Of these the Queens and Princes in reading the cardsduring the processes almostalways represent personsconnected with a matter under consideration. TheKings,if looking against the direction of the reading,or if meeting it, represent thecoming of a person orevent, or phase of an event, but if looking withthedirection of the reading represent the departure of aperson or the going offor wane of some event.The Princesses (Knaves) if looking with the direc-tion of the reading, representgeneral opinion in har-mony with, and approving of the matter; but iflookingagainst the direction of the reading the reverse.If the Diviner be performing the Divination for aperson at a distance and ofwhose general descriptionhe is ignorant, he can select the significator bycuttingthe pack, and taking one of the court cards of that suit,< 179 >cut to represent him, of course earnestly thinking ofthe person at the time.It is usually much better for the Enquirer to shuffleor cut the cards himself;but if the Diviner should haveto do this himself, he must, while doing so,earnestlythink of the person enquiring, or concerning whom theDivination isperformed. In all cases of shuffling andcutting, the person doing so shouldthink earnestly ofthe matter in hand. In cutting, if a false cut be made,that isto say if one or more cards should drop in theprocess, the cards should be atonce reshuffled, andagain cut clearly, otherwise it is probable that theanswerwill be unreliable.(Note: If the matter be important, he should waittwelve hours beforereshuffling.)In the laying out of the Cards, if any are inverted,they must remain so and mustnot be turned round,as that would alter the direction in which they wouldbelooking. A card has the same meaning and forces,whether right or inverted, sothat no particular atten-tion need be paid to the circumstances.The order of the cards as laid down must also notbe interfered with. In thereading of the cards whenlaid out, the Significator of the Enquirer is thestartingpoint, and reading proceeds by counting over certaincards in thedirection in which the face of the Courtcard chosen as Significator of theEnquirer is turned.The mode of counting is as follows, recognising thecard from which one starts asthe No. r.From every Ace—Five cards (spirit and fourelements).Princess (Knave)—Seven cards (seven palaces ofMalkuth).King, Queen, Prince — Four cards, (letters ofTetragrammaton).Smaller cards—Its own number (a sephirah).Key of Aleph Mem Shin—Three cards (number ofthe Mother letters).< i8o>Key of duplicated letters—Nine cards (number ofplanets and Caput and CaudaDraconis).Key of single letters Twelve (number of signs).The counting is continued till one alights on a cardwhich has already been read.Thus, in the following example, we will suppose thatthe significator is theQueen of Cups, and that she islooking to the left. We should read as follows:Queenof Cups—a fair woman; counting four, we come toFive of Pentacles, i.e.“Loss of money” and as it has onone side the Moon and on the other a card ofPentacles,it shows that it is through deception in business mat-ters,) we thencount 5, the number of the card, fromthe 5 of Pentacles, which falls on the 6 ofCups “Suc-cess.” But as this has on one side the Foolish Man,and on the otherthe Ace of Wands, this will not begreat owing to unwise conduct. Then we countsixfrom the 6 of Cups, still going in the same directionwhich brings us to theQueen of Cups, a card we havealready read, so we finish there.Picture #25 [images/img_0025.bmp]Thus the reading will be “A rather fair woman haslost money through somecheating in business, andthough she is again beginning to succeed, this successisliable to be damaged by unwise conduct on her partfor which she will haveherself to thank.If the significator were the Knave of Wands, and(looking towards the right) weshould count seven tothe 2 of Pentacles, then two from that to the 5ofPentacles; then five from that to the Hierophant,twelve from that to the Queenof Cups, four from thatto the King of Pentacles; then four to the Foolish Man,<181 >and thence three to the 2 of Pentacles, where we stop,having read that cardalready. “A young woman is justmaking a change in her business, which brings herlossof money through some deceit on the part of a fairwoman, and a dark manwhose foolish advice has ledto the change.” The cards would then be paired twobytwo, from opposite ends as hereafter shown; thus:Moon and Tower, “The deceitis discovered.” 3 of Pen-tacles and Queen of Cups, “On the part of thispersonwho has brought about her loss.” 2 of Pentacles andHierophant, “byadvising the change.” Knight of Cupsand Knight of Wands, “for the young womanmeets anolder man,” King of Pentacles and Fool “who counter-act the foolishadvice of the dark man.” Ace of Wandsand 6 of Cups “and she in consequencesucceeds better,but only by the dint of energy and hard work.”The scheme of Divination called “The Opening ofthe Key” is worked out in thefollowing manner. I ad-join an example carried carefully through the fivestagesfor the instruction of the Z.A.M. The complete pack of78 cards isemployed.FIRST OPERATIONRepresenting the Opening of the QuestionThe significator being chosen, the enquirer shufflesthe cards, thinkingearnestly of the matter under con-sideration. He then places the cards in asingle packeton the table before him, face downwards. This repre-sents the NameYHVH, which is now to be separatedinto the component letters. He therefore is tocut thepack as nearly in the middle as his eye can direct, andto face theuppermost portion to the right of the lower-most; the former will represent YHand the latter VII(final). He again is to cut the packet to the right handintotwo parts, as nearly in the centre as he can, andplace the uppermost part to theright again. This willrepresent Y and the lower part the remaining II. He isnowto cut the packet to the left, its uppermost part< 182 >will represent V and its lower part H (final). So thathe will now have fourpackets nearly equal in size,answering from right to left to the nameYHVH—ri'ri''under the presidency of the Four Princesses (knaves)and through themto the four radical forces (Aces).These four packets are then turned faceupwards with-out altering their relative position, and the meaning oftheir fourbottom cards thus shown may be read as anindication of the matter. Each packetis now examinedto find in which the Significator of the Enquirer is,beingcareful not to alter the order of the Cards. Thepacket containing theSignificator is retained for read-ing, and the others are put aside and not usedin thisparticular reading (operation). Carefully note to whichof the Fourletters the packet containing the significatorof the Enquirer corresponds. If toY and Wands,energy and strife. If to H and Cups, pleasure. If to Vand Swords,sickness and trouble. If to H final andPentacles, business and money. The packetcontainingthe significator is now spread out face upwards in theform of ahorseshoe (count in the way the Significatorlooks) and its meaning is read inthe manner previouslydescribed. First by counting to certain cards until oneisalighted upon which has been previously read; andthen by pairing them togetherin succession from oppo-site ends of the horseshoe. (You do not miss thesig-nificator.)Before commencing counting from the Significator,the Diviner should first noticewhat suit predominatesin the number of cards. In this a majority of Wandswouldsignify energy, quarrelling, opposition. Of Cups,pleasure and merriment. OfSwords, trouble and sad-ness, sometimes sickness and death. Of Pentacles,busi-ness, money, possession, etc. Also if in the cards laid outthere should beeither three or four cards of a sort, suchas 3 Aces, 4 Fives, etc., theirmeaning should be notedaccording to the table hereafter given. A majority oftheKeys shows forces beyond one’s control.< 183 >EXAMPLESupposing that a young man asks the question“Shall I succeed in my presentaffairs?” His complex-ion is fair, and his hair light brown. The Divinerthere-fore takes the Prince of Cups for Significator. (Had hebeen an older manhe would have selected the King ofthe same suit instead) and requests Enquirerto care-fully shuffle the pack and place it face downwards onthe table beforehim. He then instructs him to cut thepack as nearly in the centre as possible,and to placethe uppermost half well to the right, and then to cuteach of thepackets as nearly in the centre as possible,putting each uppermost half to theright of and besidethe lower half, thus yielding four packets of nearlyequaldimensions.Picture #26 [images/img_0026.bmp]Whoever cuts, CUB to his own rightHere the 10 of Wands is strong, being in the placeof Yod which governsWands—Fire. The Six of Swordsis moderately strong, being in the place of Hehwhichrules Cups—Water, which is not a hostile and contraryelement to Air; the 4of Pentacles is weak because it isin the place of Vau which rules the contraryelement toEarth, viz. Air; and the Chariot—Cancer, a waterysign, is fairlystrong, being in the place of Heh final,which rules Earth, a friendly element toWater.The Diviner then reads these 4 Cards as a prelimi-nary thus: “The Enquirer worksvery hard and gainsbut little money, yet matters are beginning to im-< 184 >prove.” Because the io of Wands shows cruelty, harsh-ness, etc. 6 of Swords,labour and work. 4 of Pentacles,gain of money, and the Chariot, success.The Diviner then examines the Four Packets to findin which one the Significatoris. It proves to be in theone of which the 6 of Swords is the bottom card.Thisis in the place answering to the letter Heh, which repre-sents pleasure andrules Cups. This is so far a goodomen, as it shows society and merriment. Thispack ofcards is retained for reading, the others are put asideas not bearing onthe question. Let us suppose thatthis packet consists of 20 cards, and that theyare inthe following order. The Diviner spreads them out inthe form of ahorseshoe:Picture #27 [images/img_0027.bmp]The suit of Cups is distinctly in the majority—pleasure, visiting friends,love-making, etc. There are3 Knaves which indicates Society of the young.Fromwhich the Diviner reads that the Enquirer is fond ofyoung people and offlirting, etc. There being no otherset of 3 or 4 cards of a sort, the Divinerproceeds toread by counting from the Significator, whose face isturned towardsthe 9 of Wands.The counting therefore proceeds in the direction ofthe arrow, thus: 4 from theKing of Cups, 10 of Pen-tacles. 10 from this, 8 of Cups. 8 from this, WheelofFortune. 9 from this, Knave of Wands, 7 from this,<i85>io of Cups, io from this, 5 of Wands. 5 from this,Knight of Wands. 4 from this,Ace of Pentacles. 5 fromthis, 10 of Cups. And as this card has alreadybeentaken, this form of reading finishes here.In this reading as hereafter explained, each card ismodified by the card ineither side of it; if it be an endcard, such as the 6 of Swords, in this case itis modifiednot only by the card next to it, Ace of Pentacles, butalso by thecard at the opposite end, Knave of Wands.If these cards are of a contrary element to the carditself, they very muchweaken and neutralize its force,but if the contrary element is only in one card,and theother is of a connecting nature, it does not much matter.This isexplained later among the tabulated rules. TheKing of Cups is between the 9 ofWands and the Wheelof Fortune, both of which cards are of a fiery nature,andtherefore contrary to Cups which is Water, andtherefore it shows that theEnquirer is rather lackingin perseverance and energy. 10 of Pentacles, “Hisbusi-ness will begin to prosper,” 8 of Cups, “but yet he willlose interest init, owing to his love of pleasure andsociety” (shown by 8 of Cups having thesuit on eachside of it). Wheel of Fortune, “and through his fortunechanging forthe better.” Knave of Wands (Knight ofWands on one side and 6 of Swords on theother), “Heyet is anxious through falling in love with a gracefuland sprightlygirl with chestnut hair and fair complex-ion whom he has recently met” (shown byKnight ofWands turned contrary to the course of the reading),io of Cups, “Hissuit is at first favourably received,”5 of Swords, “but some slanderous reportsand mischiefmaking” (not altogether without foundation) “cometo her knowledge.”Ace of pentacles, “though his in-creasing prosperity in business,” 10 of Cups,“had leadher to regard him with favour.”The Diviner now pairs the cards from opposite endsof the horseshoe, thus:<i86>Knave of Wands6 of Swords“She is anxious about this/*Knight of WandsAce of Pentacles“And he begins to neglect his businesswhich yet is fairly good.3 of Cups2 of Pentacles“And instead throws aside his businessfor pleasures.Knight of Cups5 of Cups“The consequence of this is that theengagement between them is brokenoff, shownby knight being turned inopposite direction.10 of Pentacles8 of Cups“Still his business does fairly wellthough he is lovSing interest in it.5 of Swords1 oof Cups“The matter is the subject of muchgossip.'g of WandsQueen of CupsThese two cards of contrary suitsand therefore of little importance,“Among theiracquaintances/5King of CupsKnave of Cups“He moreover, begins to pay attentionto another girl of not quite sofaircomplexionWheel of FortuneKing of Swords“who, however, prefers a dark man,who is much admired by the fair sex(shown byhis being next two Knavesand a Queen,)6 of WandsKnave of Pentacles“But he has already gained the affec-tions of a girl with dark brown eyesandhair/1 (This description is ob-tained by mixing the effect of theWands withPents,)This concludes the reading in the First Operation,which may be thus resumed:“The enquirer is a fair young man who works veryhard, and has hitherto gainedbut little money,_ yetmatters are beginning to improve. He is fond ofsociety,and of visiting friends. He is rather lacking in perse-verance andenergy, though notwithstanding this, his< 187 >business and money transactions will begin to prosper.But yet he will loseinterest in it owing to his love ofpleasure and society, and though his fortuneis chang-ing for the better he has yet much anxiety throughfailing in love witha graceful and sprightly girl withchestnut hair and fair complexion whom he hasrecentlymet. His suit is at first favourably received, but someslanderous talesand mischief-making not altogetherwithout foundation, come to her knowledge,thoughhis increasing prosperity in business has led her toregard him withfavour. She is made anxious by this,and he begins to neglect his business whichyet is fairlygood, and instead abandons it for pleasure and merry-making.”“The consequence of this is that the engagement isbroken off. Still his businessdoes fairly well though hehas lost interest in it. The whole affair is thesubject ofmuch gossip among their mutual acquaintances. (Oneof the chiefmischief-makers is a fair middle-agedwoman shown by the Queen of Cups.) He,however,soon begins to pay attention to another girl of not quiteso fair acomplexion. She, however, prefers a dark youngman who is much admired generallyby the fair sex,but he has already gained the affection of a youngwoman withdark brown hair and blue eyes.”SECOND OPERATION(Representing the development of the Matter.)The Enquirer again carefully shuffles the cards, andplaces the Pack on the tableface downwards, but is notto cut them. The Diviner now takes the Pack anddealsit round card by card in iz Packets face downwards inrotation as in thefollowing diagram: (Deal and readin order of Houses against the direction of theSun.)So that the first packet answering to the Ascendantwall consist of the ist,13th, 25th, 37th, 49th, 61st, 73rdcards, as shown, and so on.This Operation is under the presidency of the CourtCards, whose dominion in theCelestial Heavens falls<:88>immediately between that of the 4 Knaves and that ofthe Keys answering to the 12Signs of the Zodiac. Itrepresents the 12 Astrological Houses of Heaven, asshown.Without altering the relative order of thepackets, or of the cards in thepackets, the Divinerexamines each in succession, till he finds the onewhichcontains the Significator. This he retains for reading,noting carefully towhich astrological house it corre-sponds and gathers up the other packets, andputs themaside, as they are not of any further use in thisoperation.Picture #28 [images/img_0028.bmp]As before, the Diviner reads the packet containingthe Significator, by spreadingthem out in the form ofa horseshoe, first reading by counting the cards inorderfrom the Significator in the direction in which the faceof the figure onthe card is turned, and next by pairingthe cards together from the opposite endsof the horse-shoe. It is hardly likely that in so small a packet therewill beeither 3 or 4 cards of a sort, but if there be, theDiviner takes note of thesame, and also observes whichsuit predominates. I now continue the examplescom-menced in the previous operation. I must here observethat the example ispurely of my own invention, and< 189 >of course is not contained in the Book T, wherein onlythe mode of working isgiven. I have purposely takena commonplace, trivial, and material questionforelucidation. (S.R.M.D.)EXAMPLE(Cont.)We will suppose the Enquirer to have duly and care-fully shuffled the Cards,thinking of his affairs, and thatthe Diviner has dealt them round into 12packets asabove shown. The packet containing the Significator islocated in theAscendant, and it contains the followingcards in the order given.SignificatorThis mode of reading shows that as the Significatoris in the Ascendant it willprincipally relate to theEnquirer’s manner of living at this point.The Significator is in this case right way up, whereasin the previous reading itwas inverted and is lookingtowards the 9 of Swords, which direction thereforethereading proceeds, counting thus: 4 from King of Cups—Knave of Pentacles; 7from this—Sun; 9 from this—Knave of Pentacles; 7 from this—Sun; where thereadingends.Picture #29 [images/img_0029.bmp]Kings of Cups “The enquirer is unhappy” (looking to9 of Swords) “and makes the ac-Knave of Pentacles 2u?intan.ce,. the girl Th ?e dafhair and blue eyes with whom thedark young man (his rival) is in love*(She is artistic and well-mannered,andhopes to carry out her wishes, he.to marry the dark man with whom thefair girl,to whom the Enquirer hastransferred his affection, is now inlove*) For she isbeginning to be ap-prehensive regarding her success, andis jealous inconsequence/*< 190 >Pairing the cards from opposite ends of the horse-shoe the Diviner proceeds:King of Cups “The Enquirer is anxious, and his9 of Swords health begins to suffer.8 of Pentacles “but hopes ultimately to succeedSun through skillful action in the matter.”4 of Swords “He therefore endeavours to make aKnave of Pentacles friend of the dark girl.”Temnerance “As he expects to realize his wishes byemperance her means jn the end.» (This is shownby the card being single in the end.)THIRD OPERATION(Continuing the Development of the Question)The Enquirer again carefully shuffles the cards, whilethinking earnestly of heraffairs. The pack is not cut.The Diviner deals out the cards into iz Packets inpre-cisely the same manner as in the Second Operation.Only instead of beingreferred to the 12 AstrologicalHouses, these 12 Packets are under the presidencyofthe 12 Keys of the Tarot attributed to the 12 Signs ofthe Zodiac. The firstpacket, Emperor—Aries, the 2nd,Hierophant—Taurus, the 3rd, Lovers—Gemini, andsoon. As before the Diviner selects the packet which con-tains the Significatorfor reading, and rejects the rest.He notes also the meaning of the Key answeringto theSign of the Zodiac, under which the Packet falls. Hespreads the cards outin the form of a horseshoe, exactlyas before. I now continue the example beforecom-menced:EXAMPLEWe will suppose that the Packet containing the Kingof Cups is that whoseposition answers to the Hiero-phant—Taurus and that it consists of thefollowingcards, arranged as in the diagram on page 188.The Hierophant and the majority of the cards in thispacket being Keys alike showthat the forces at present< I91 >at work are ceasing to be under the control of theEnquirer. The reading proceedsaccording to the usualorder of counting, as follows: King of Cups, 2 ofWands.Magician—Queen of Wands; Universe—Tower; 2 ofWands again. It may bementioned that supposing aPicture #30 [images/img_0030.bmp]packet to consist of six cards, and the Significator tobe a Knave, or counting 7from it, it would come backto the Knave again, this would show that theEnquirerwould act according to his own ideas in this point ofthe question, andwould not let his line of action beinfluenced by the opinion of others. (Thereading wouldthen proceed by the pairing of the cards as usual:)“Though anxious concerning severalmatters, he (the Enquirer) is beginningtosuceed better by this line of action.”“which seems to be quite the best. Butthe older woman (who previouslymademischief and was represented by theQueen of Cups in the 1st Operation)who isartful and a gossip.”“again injures the matter because shewishes to get an influence over theEn-quirer herself.”Pairing the cards, the Diviner proceeds:2 of Wands “her influence cunningly exercised, bringsTnwer about a complete disruption of thewhole matter.King of Cups2 of WandsMagicianQueen of WandsUniverse—Tower2 of WandsUniverse “The entire matter becomes investedMagician with trickery and glamour.”Queen of Wands “as she herself pays him a good deal ofKing of Cups attention andsympathy,”2 of Pentacles “which furthers her plans by bringingabout a friendship between them.”< I92 >FOURTH OPERATION{The further development of the Question)As before the Enquirer is instructed to shuffle thepack and place it on thetable but not to cut it.The Diviner takes the Pack, turns it face upwards,and goes through it, beingcareful not to disarrangethe order of the cards, till he finds the Significator;atthis point he cuts the Pack, that is to say, he takes theSignificator and thecards which had been beneath itand places them on the top of the remainder,turningthe whole face downwards again, ready for dealing out.(Very careful here:S.A.)The consequence of this Operation is that the Sig-nificator becomes the top cardof the pack (bottom,really; face on table.) The Diviner takes off theSignifi-cator, places it face upwards on the middle of the tableand then thefollowing 36 Decanates—36 cards out inthe form of a circle round it, faceupwards, answeringto the 36 Decanates of the Zodiac, and showing thefurtherdevelopment of the Question, These are dealtround in the order and direction ofdealing as the 12packets in the two previous operations.The reading proceeds by the same law of counting,but instead of counting fromthe Significator itself, itbegins from the first card of the 36, and alwaysgoesin the direction of dealing. The suit which is in themajority and thecircumstances of either 3 or 4 cardsof a sort being found in the 36 Decanatesare also noted.When the reading by counting is finished the cards arepairedtogether: 1st and 36th; 2nd and 35th; 3rd and34th; and so on, placed in ordersuccessively upon theSignificator. I now continue the example before com-menced:EXAMPLEWe will suppose the Enquirer to have shuffled thepack, and that the Divinertakes it in his hands, and inturning it up finds the bottom card to beTemperance.On going through it he comes to the Significator, thus:< 193 >SignificatorPicture #31 [images/img_0031.bmp]He therefore takes the cards from King of Cups toTemperance included and placesthem above (or be-hind, S.A) the 5 of Pentacles, being careful not todisturbtheir relative order. This has really the effectof cutting the pack between theQueen of Wands andthe King of Cups and of course when he again turnsPicture #32 [images/img_0032.bmp]them face downwards ready for dealing, the King ofCups will necessarily be thetop card and the Queen ofWands the bottom card; Temperance being immedi-atelyabove the 5 of Pentacles, the former top card. TheDiviner takes the top card,the Significator and places< 194 >it face upwards in the centre, and then deals round insuccession 36 cards, faceupwards in the order shownin the Diagram on page 190,Let us suppose them to be thus arranged. The readingalways proceeds in the samedirection as the dealing inthis form of operation, commencing the countingfromthe 1st card dealt.We here find 12 out of the 22 keys; 7 of Wands; 7 ofCups; 5 of Swords; 6 ofPentacles; total 37 includingSignificator. The preponderance of the Keysrepresent“Influences beyond the control of the Enquirer.” Thereare four Princes(Kings)—“Meetings with influentialpersons,” and four Eights, “Much news andcor-respondence.”The counting proceeds as follows from the first carddealt. Kings of Cups—Six ofCups—5 of Pentacles—Hermit — 4 of Cups — Fortitude — 4 of Swords — 7ofCups—Justice—s of Cups—King of Swords—Em-peror—6 of Cups again.King of Cups6 of Cups“The Enquirer’s love of pleasure-going,”5 of Pentacles“brings about loss of money and busi-ness.”Hermit“and he is forced to be more prudent,”4 of Cups“and not go into the society of others somuch, which has already broughthimanxiety (shown by 4 Cups between 2Wands, contrary element weakeningeffect onthis card.)Fortitude“He works more closely.”4 of Swords“and begins to get better.7 of Cups“Yet he has not sufficient energy in hisnature to stick to work for long.”Justice“The retributive effect of this is”5 of Cups“that he loses his friends,”< I9S >King of WandsEmperor6 of Cups“And his former rival who, though rathera vain man, is energetic and hard work-• _ »mg.“replaces him in popularity and esteem.*3Pairing them now, the Diviner proceeds:King of CupsDeath6 of Cups“The Enquirer loses pleasure in conse-quence.4 of Swords7 of Cups“and becomes less energetic even thanbefore, and more anxious for pleasure-goingthan ever.MoonChariot“yielding to the temptation of idlenessand vanity by means of fraud.8 of SwordsAce of Pentacles“He embezzles the money of his em-ployer, and sees prison staring him intheface.”8 of CupsTemperance“The result of this is the loss of goodname.3 of Pentacles5 of Pentacles“and of his situation of trust.10 of Wands2 of Cups“His former friends and admirers turn acold shoulder to hirmFoolish ManJustice“And the result of his folly is that he isarrested and brought before a courtoflaw.7 of WandsHierophant“The decision is adverse.JudgmentHermit“And judgment very justly given againsthim.EmperorKing of Wands“But his employer, though stern, is akind-hearted man,”2 of Swords9 of Swords“offers to take him back and overlookthe past< 196 >StarFortitude“As he hopes this will have proved a les-son to him.King of SwordsKing of Pentacles“and points out to him that his formerrival.3 of Wands8 of Pentacles“though perhaps vain, was yet a hard-working and good man of business*4 of Cups10 of Swords“The Enquirer in consequence of thisdetermines to completely give up hisformermode of life which had broughthim to the brink of ruin, and becomesa steady man*8 of Wands6 of Wands“After this he suddenly receives a hastymessage which gives him much pleasure.3 of Cups9 of Pentacles“stating that owing to the loss of a rela-tive he is the inheritor of a legacy,”This concludes the Fourth Operation.It is always necessary for the Diviner to employ hisintuition in reading, andsometimes he may have toclairvoyantly “go through” a card of doubtfulsignifi-cation. Thus in the reading just given it is only thecircumstance of theMoon, Chariot, 8 of Swords, Aceof Pentacles being followed by other conformativecardswhich justifies such an evil meaning of them.FIFTH OPERATION(Conclusion of the Matter)The cards are to be again carefully shuffled by theEnquirer but NOT cut. TheDiviner then takes thePack, and deals it card by card in rotation intotenanswering to the Tree of Life. This refers to the rule ofthe 10 Sephiroth inthe Celestial Heavens. This beingdone, the Diviner selects the packetscontaining theSignificator for reading, noting carefully under whichSephira itfalls, and taking this as a general indicationin the matter. This packet is thenspread out in ahorseshoe form, and read in the usual way, countingfrom theSignificator and this time in the direction in< 197 >which the face of the figure looks. I he cards are finallypaired together as inthe previous Operation. This com-pletes the Mode of Divination called “TheOpening ofthe Key.” I now give the conclusion of the example.EXAMPLE(Cont.)We will suppose that the cards have been shuffledand dealt in the followingmanner into io Packetsanswering to the Sephiroth in the Tree of Life:154S.35, 43.33.2V5, 5.Picture #33 [images/img_0033.bmp]0f,//, 2f,3lr 4tf ate.Picture #34 [images/img_0034.bmp]22, <2 L Z -15,45.35,43 55,25,13, 3*1464,54,44,54,24,14. 4.,48,53,23,1®. 3.07G,«,54, 44,5C, 26,16, fe.□71, £1,51,41.31,ati.□fc>9,59, 49, 59, 29.19,9.70,60,5o, 4o, 50,20,10.The packet containing the Significator falls underBinah, containing the 3, 13,23, 33, 43) S3) 63, and 73rdcards dealt. This is an argument of sadness andtrial.The cards are spread as follows:< 198 >Picture #35 [images/img_0035.bmp]The counting proceeds as follows: King of Cups—Star—Judgment—King of Cups again.Evil cards arein the majority, another argument of loss and trouble.King of CupsStarJudgment“He has hopes of thus re-establishinghis fortunes and that a favourableresultwill ensue for him.”The Diviner then pairs them thus:King of Cups7 of Pentacles“He plunges therefore into speculationby which he loses heavily (7 Pents.is nearHanged Man.)Knave of Cups “and his love affair comes to nothing.Hanged ManStarJudgmentKnight of Pentacles8 of Swords“All his expectations are disappointed.“and his life for a time is arduous,petty, and uninteresting.(The coming of trouble is here shown by the Knightof Pentacles looking againstthe direction of the read-ing. If it were turned the other way it would showthathis troubles were quitting him and that matters wouldimprove.) Thiscompletes the operation, and shows thegeneral development and result of thequestion.< 199 >Picture #36 [images/img_0036.bmp]TABULATED RULES1. Shu fling, Cutting, Dealing and Examining.In shuffling, the mind of the Enquirer should beearnestly fixed on the matterconcerning which he de-sires information. If any cards fall in the process,theyshould be taken up without being noticed and theshuffling resumed. Theshuffling being concluded, andthe pack placed upon the table, if any cards fallto theground, or become turned in a different direction, theshuffling should bedone again.A cut should be clean and decided. If any cards fallfrom the hand in theperformance, the operation ofshuffling should be repeated before they are againcut.In dealing, care should be taken not to invert the cards,and their relativeorder should be strictly observed. Inexamining a pack of cards, their relativeorder shouldbe rigidly maintained, as without care in this respect,one may beeasily pushed under or over another, whichwould of course have the effect ofcompletely alteringthe counting in the Reading.2. Of the Selection of the Significator, and of the Com-plexion assigned to theCourt Cards.Wands generally—fair and red-haired person.Cups generally—moderately fair.Swords generally—moderately dark.Pentacles generally—very dark.The Kings—Men.Queens—-Women.Princes—Young Men.Princesses (Knaves)—Young women.Therefore the Significators are to be thus selected.For example, a darkcomplexioned middle-aged man,King of Pentacles. A fair young woman,Princess(Knave) of Cups, etc.In the actual reading of the cards, these descriptionscan be modified by thosewhich are on either side of< 200 >them, thus: The Queen of Cups, which indicates a fairwoman with golden brownhair, if between cards of thesuits of Swords and Pentacles, would show awomanwith rather dark brown hair and dark eyes. As beforestated, the Princes andQueens almost invariably repre-sent actual men and women connected with thesubjectin hand. Put the Kings sometimes represent either thecoming on or goingoff of a matter; arrival, or depar-ture, according to the way in which theyface. Whilethe Princesses (Knaves) show opinions, thoughts, orideas, either inharmony with or opposed to the subject.3. Of the General signification of the Majority of aparticular suit and of theparticular signification ofeither 3 or 4 cards of a sort in a reading:A majority of Wands—Energy, quarrelling, opposition.A majority of Cups—Pleasureand merriment.A majority of Swords—Trouble and sadness, sometimessickness and even death.A majority of Pentacles—business, money, possessions,etc.A majority of Keys—Forces of considerable strength,but beyond the Enquirer’scontrol.A majority of Court Cards—Society, meeting withmany persons.A majority of Aces—Strength generally; the aces arealways strong cards.4 Aces—Great powder and Force.3 Aces—Riches and Success.4 Kings—Great swiftness and rapidity.3 Kings—unexpected meetings.Kings generally show news.4 Queens generally—Authority and influence.3 Queens generally—Powerful and influential friends.4 Princes or Knights—Meetings with the great.3 Princes or Knights—Rank and honour.4 Princesses (Knaves)—New ideas and plans.3 Princesses (Knaves)—Society of the young.4 Tens generally—Anxiety and responsibility.< 201 >3 Tens generally—Buying, selling, commercial transac-tions.4 Nines generally—Added responsibility.3 Nines generally—Much correspondence.4 Eights generally—Much news.3 Eights generally—Much journeying.4 Sevens generally—Disappointments.3 Sevens generally—Treaties and compacts.4 Sixes generally—Pleasure.3 Sixes generally—Gain and Success.4 Fives generally—Order, regularity.3 Fives generally—Quarrels, fights.4 Fours generally—Rest and Peace.3 Fours generally—Industry.4 Threes generally—Resolution and determination.3 Threes generally—Deceit.4 Deuces generally—Conference and conversations.3 Deuces generally — Reorganization an drecommence-ment of a thing.The Keys are not noticed as above, by tbrees andfours.4.

(That is,if the subject which is enquired about be spiritual.)Butif the Divination be regarding a material event ofordinary life, this card isnot good, and shows folly,stupidity, eccentricity, and even mania, unlesswithvery good cards indeed. It is too ideal and unstable tobe generally good inmaterial things.1. Magician or Juggler. Skill, wisdom, adaptation.Craft, cunning, etc., alwaysdepending on its dignity.Sometimes occult Wisdom.2.

Display, Vanity, butonly when with very evilcards.20. Judgment. Final decision. Judgment. Sentence.Determination of a matterwithout appeal on its plane.2,1. Universe. The matter itself. Synthesis. World.Kingdom. Usually denotes theactual subject of thequestion, and therefore depends entirely on theaccom-panying cards.6, On the Signification of the Cards.A card is strong or weak, well-dignified or ill-digni-fied, according to thecards which are next to it oneither side. Cards of the same suit on eithersidestrengthen it greatly either for good or evil, accordingto their nature.Cards of the suits answering to itscontrary element, on either side, weaken itgreatly forgood or evil. Air and Earth are contraries as also areFire and Water.Air is friendly with Water and Fire,and Fire with Air and Earth.If a card of the suit of Wands falls between a Cupand a Sword, the Swordmodifies and connects theWand with the Cup, so that it is not weakened byitsvicinity, but is modified by the influence of both cards;therefore fairlystrong. But if a card pass between twowhich are naturally contrary, it is notaffected by eithermuch, as a Wand between a Sword and a Pentaclewhich latter,being Air and Earth, are contrary andtherefore weaken each other.Here the question being of the Wand, this card is notto be noticed as forming alink between the Sword andPentacle.A FEW EXAMPLES GIVEN BY S.R.M.D.9 10 5 Very strong and potent in action.

If ofopposite elements they< 20 7 >mutually weaken each other. If at the end of the pair-ing of the cards in apacket, one card remains over, itsignifies the partial result of that particularpart of theDivination only. If an evil card and the others good, itwould modifythe good.If it be the Signilicator of the Enquirer, or of anotherperson, it would showthat matters would much dependon the line of action taken by the personrepresented.The reason of this importance of the single card is, thatit isalone, and not modified. If two cards are at the endinstead of a single one,they are not of so muchimportance.8. On the Exercise of Clairvoyance and Intuition.The Diviner should, in describing any person from aSignificator in the actual reading, endeavour, by Clair-voyance and using thecard in question as a symbol, tosee the person implied using the rules to aid,and re-strict, his vision. In describing an event from thecards in the reading,he should employ his intuition inthe same manner. Personal descriptions aremodified bythe cards next them; e.g., the Knave of Wands repre-sents usually avery fair girl, but if between cards ofthe suit of Pentacles, she might be evenquite dark,though the Wands would still give a certain brightnessto hair, eyes,and complexion.9. On counting in the Reading.In all cases of counting from the card last touched,the card itself is 1, thatnext it is 2, and so on.From every Ace—5 is counted.From every Princess (Knave)—7 is counted.From every other Court card—4 is counted.From every small card—the number of its pips.From every Key answering to an Element—3 iscounted.From every Key answering to a Sign—12 iscounted.From every Key answering to a Planet—-9 iscounted.< 208 >UNOFFICIALTHE TAROT TRUMPSBy G. H. Soror, Q.L.The cards of the Lesser Arcana present to us thevibrations of Number, Colour andElement—that is,the plane on which number and colour function. Thus,in the Tenof Pentacles we have the number Ten andtertiary colours, citrine, olive, andrusset, working inMalkuth, the material plane. Whereas in the Ten ofWands wehave the number Ten and the tertiariesworking in pure energy. In these cards,the Sephirahis indicated by the colouring of the clouds; the planeby thecolouring of the symbols.The four honours of each suit taken in their mostabstract sense may beinterpreted as:Potential Power The KingBrooding Power The QueenPower in action. The PrinceReception and Transmission... .The PrincessAH these cards are coloured according to their ele-ments plus the Sephirah towhich they are attributed.With the Greater Arcana, the Trumps, however, wearegiven the Keys to divine manifestation, each onean individual force to beconsidered independently. Itmust never be forgotten that the Trumps are,intrin-sically, glyphs of cosmic not human forces.o. The Foolish Man. This card as usually presentedshows a man in motley stridingalong, heedless of thedog which tears his garments and threatens to attackhim.In this is seen only the lower aspect of the card,giving no hint to the DivineFolly of which St. Paulspeaks. But in the Order pack, an effort is made torevealthe deeper meaning. A naked child stands be-neath a rose-tree bearing yellowroses—the golden Roseof Joy as well as the Rose of Silence. While reaching up< 209 >to the Roses, he yet holds in leash a grey wolf, worldlywisdom held in check byperfect innocence. The coloursare pale yellow, pale blue, greenishyellow—suggestiveof the early dawn of a spring day.I. The Magician. It represents the union and bal-ance of the elemental powerscontrolled by mind. TheAdept dedicating the minor implements on the Altar.Thepaths of Beth and Mercury link Kether the Crownwith Binah, the Aimah Elohim. TheMagician, there-fore, is reflected in the Intellect wdiich stores andgathers upknowledge and pours it into the House ofLife, Binah. The number of the Path, 12,suggests thesynthesis of the Zodiac, as Mercury is the synthesis ofthe planets.The colours yellow, violet, grey and indigo,point to the mysterious astral lightsurrounding thegreat Adept. It is a card linked with the name Tahutiand Hermesas the previous one is with Krishna andHarparkrat or Dionysius.II. The High Priestess. The Hinh Priestess rules thelong path uniting Kether toTiohareth, crossing thereciprocal Paths of Venus and Leo. She is thegreatfeminine force controlling the very source of life, gather-ing into herselfall the energising forces and holdingthem in solution until the time of release.Her colours,pale blue, deepening into skv blue, silvery white, andsilver,relieved by touches of orange and flame, carryout these ideas.III. The Empress. She is an aspect of Isis; the cre-ative and positive side ofNature is suggested here. TheEgyption trilogy, Isis, Hathor and Nenhthys,symbol-ised by the crescent, full moon, and gibbous moon arerepresented in theTarot by the High Priestess, Hathor.The Empress, Isis, takes either the crescentmoon orVenus as her symbol. Justice, Nephthys, takes thegibbous moon.Isis and Venus gives the aspect of Love, while Hathoris rather the Mystic, thefull moon reflecting the Sunof Tiphareth while in Yesod, transmitting the raysofthe Sun in her path Gimel. In interpreting a practical< 210 >Tarot it is often admissable to regard the Empress asstanding for Occultism. TheHigh Priestess for religion,the Church as distinguished from the Order.The Empress, whose letter is Daleth, is the Door ofthe inner mysteries, as Venusis the door of the Vault.Her colours are emerald, sky-blue, blue-green andceriseor rose-pink.IV. The Emperor. Here we have the great energisingforces as indicated by thevarying shades of red. It maybe noted here that the red paths remain red inallplanes, varying only in shade. Thus Aries, the Emperor,the Pioneer, theGeneral, is blood and deep crimson,red, pure vermillion or glowing fiery red. Heis Ho Nike,the Conqueror, hot, passionate, impetuous, the apothe-osis of Mars,whether in love or in war. He is the posi-tive masculine as the Empress is thepositive feminine.V. Hierophant. The High Priest is the counterpartof the High Priestess. As Ariesis the house of Mars andthe exaltation of the Sun, so Taurus is the houseofVenus and the exaltation of the Moon. He is the re-flective or mystical aspectof the masculine. He is thethinker as the Emperor is the doer.His colours unlike those of the Emperor, vary con-siderably. Red, orange,maroon, deep brown, and chest-nut brown, suggest veiled thought, interiorpower,endurance, contemplation and reconciliation. This cardfrequently indicatesthe hidden guardianship of theMasters.VI. The Lovers. The impact of inspiration on intui-tion, resulting inillumination and liberation—thesword striking off the fetters of habit andmaterialism,Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the Dragon of fearand the waters ofStagnation. (Note: Incidentally notethat this is the design of the Order card.Andromeda isshown manacled to a rock, the dragon rising from thewaters at herfeet. Perseus is depicted flying throughthe air to her assistance, withunsheathed sword. Thedesign is wholly different from that of theWaitepack.—I.R.)< 211 >The colours are orange, violet, purplish grey andpearl grey. The flashing colourof orange gives deepvivid blue while the flashing colour for violet isgoldenyellow. The flashing colours may always be introducedif they bring out theessential colour meaning moreclearly. In practise this card usually signifiessympa-thetic understanding.VII. The Chariot. Here we have a symbol of thespirit of man controlling thelower principles, soul andbody, and thus passing triumphantly through theastralplane, rising above the clouds of illusion andpenetrating to the higher spheres.The colours amber, silver-grey, blue-grey, and thedeep blue violet of the nightsky elucidate this symbol.It is the sublimation of the Psyche.VIII. Strength. This also represents the mastery ofthe lower by the higher. Butin this case it is the soulwhich holds in check the passions, although herfeetare still planted on earth, and the dark veil still floatsabout her head andclings around her. The colours,pale greenish yellow, black, yellowish grey andreddishamber, suggest the steadfast endurance and fortituderequired, but thedeep red rose which is the flashingcolour to the greenish yellow, gives themotive power.IX. The Hermit. Prudence. These three trumpsshould be collated in studying themfor they representthe three stages of initiation. The man wrapped in hoodandmantle, and carrying a lantern to illuminate thePath and a staff to support hisfootsteps, He is theeternal seeker, the Pilgrim soul. His hood and mantleare thebrown of earth, and above him is the night-sky.But the delicate yellow-greensand bluish greens ofspring are about him, and spring is in his heart.X. Wheel of Fortune. In tbe Etz Chayim, or theTree of Life, the Wheel is placedon the Pillar of Mercy,where it forms the principal column linking NetzachtoChesed, Victory to Mercy. It is the revolution ofexperience and progress, thesteps of the Zodiac, therevolving staircase, held in place by the counter-< 212 >changing influence of Light and Darkness, Time andEternity—presided over by thePlutonian cynocephalusbelow, and the Sphinx of Egypt above, the eternalRiddlewhich can only be solved when we attain libera-tion. The basic colours of thisTrump are blue, violet,deep purple, and blue irradiated by yellow. Butthezodiacal spokes of the wheel should be in the coloursof the spectrum, whilethe Ape is in those of Malkuth,and the Sphinx in the primary colours and black.XL Justice. Nephthys, the third aspect of Luna,the twin sister of Isis. Justiceas distinguished fromlove. Her emblems are the Sword and the Scales. Likeherssiter, she is clothed in green, but in a sharper coldergreen than the pureemerald of Isis. Her subsidiarycolours are blue, blue-green, pale green. It isonly byutilising the flashing colours that we can find the hiddenwarmth andsteadfastness.XII. The Hanged Man. An elusive, because a pro-foundly significant symbol. It issacrifice—the sub-mergence of the higher in the lower in order tosublimate thelower. It is the descent of the Spirit intoMatter, the incarnation of God inman, the submissionto the bonds of matter that the material may betranscendedand transmuted. The colours are deepblue, white and black intermingled but notmerged,olive, green and greenish fawn.XIII. Death. The sign of transmutation and dis-integration. The skeleton whichalone survives thedestructive power of time, may be regarded as thefoundationupon which the structure is built, the typewhich persists through thepermutations of Time andSpace, adaptable to the requirements of evolution andyetradically unchanged; the transmuting power ofNature working from below upwards,as the HangedMan is the transmuting power of the spirit workingfrom abovedownwards. The colours are blue-green,both dark and pale, the two dominantcolours of thevisible world, and the flashing colours of orange andred-orange.< 213 >XIV. Temperance. This is the equilibrium not ofthe balance of Libra but of theimpetus of the Arrow,Sagittarius, which cleaves its way through the air bytheforce imparted to it by the taut string of the Bow.It requires thecounterchanged forces of Fire andWater, Shin and Qoph, held by the restrainingpowerof Saturn, and concentrated by the energies of Mars toinitiate thisimpetus. All these are summed up in thesymbolism of the figure standing betweenEarth andWater, holding the two amphorae with their streamsof living water, andwith the volcano in the background.The colours are bright-blue, blue-grey,slate-blue, andlilac-grey.XV. Tke Devil. This card should be studied in con-junction with No. 13. They arethe two great controllingforces of the Universe, the centrifugal and thecentri-petal, destructive and reproductive, dynamic and static.The lower natureof man fears and hates the trans-muting process; hence the chains binding thelesserfigures and the bestial forms of their lower limbs. Yetthis very fear ofchange and disintegration is necessaryto stabilise the life-force and preservecontinuity. Thecolours are indigo, livid brown, golden brown and grey.XVI. The Tower. As always red remains persistentthroughout the four planes,although modified in tone.Thus we find vivid scarlet shading into deep sombreredand vermillion shot with amber. The contrastingshades of green serve to throwthe red into relief. Thetremendous destructive influence of the lightning,rend-ing asunder established forms to make way for newforms to emerge,revolution as distinguished from trans-mutation or sublimation, the destructiveas opposed tothe conservative, energy attacking inertia, the impetu-ous ejectionof those who would enclose themselves inthe walls of ease and tradition.XVII. The Star. This shows the seven-pointed Starof Venus shining above theWaters of Aquarius, theguiding force of love in all its forms and aspects,illu-minates the soul during her immersion in Humanity,< 214 >so that the bonds of Saturn are dissolved in the purifiedWaters of Baptism. Thedove of the Spirit hovers abovethe Tree of Knowledge giving the promise ofultimateattainment—and on the other side gleams of the Treeof Life.Pale colours suggest dawn and the morning Star—amethyst, pale grey, fawn, dovecolour and white, withthe pale yellow of the Star.XVIII. The Moon. Mere also is a river but it is thetroubled waters of Night,w'herein is to be described acrayfish, counterpart of the Scarabeus. Fromthewater’s edge winds the dark path of toil, effort andpossible failure. It isguarded by the threatening watch-dogs, seeking to intimidate the wayfarers,while in thedistance the barren hills are surmounted by the frown-ing fortressesstill further guarding the way to attain-ment. It is the path of blood and tearsin which fear,weakness, and fluctuation must be overcome. The col-ours are darkcrimson, reddish brown, brownish crimsonand plum colours—but their sombre huesare lightenedby the translucent faint greens and yellows to be foundin theircounterparts.XIX. The Sun. The Watery Paths of trial and pro-bation are counterbalanced bythe fiery paths ofTemptation, Judgment, and Decision. In violent con-trast tothe sombre colouring of Aquarius and Pisces,we are confronted by the flaringhues of the Sun andFire. The too-aspiring Icarus may find his waxen wingsofAmbition and Curiosity shrivelled and melted bythe fiery rays of the Sun and theheat of Fire, butapproached with humility and reverence, the Sun be-comes thebeneficent source of life.Protected by an enclosing wall, standing by theWaters of repentance, the Pilgrimmay submit himselfhumbly but w'ithout fear to the searching Light andabsorbwarmth and vitality from it for the strugglebefore him. The colours areclear-orange, golden-yellow,amber shot with red, and the contrasting blueandpurple.< 215 >XX. The Last Judgment. The three trumps attrib-uted to the Elemental Paths areperhaps the. mostdifficult to understand. They represent the action offorcesexterior to the experience of humanity, not theinfluence of environment but theimpact of the Super-nals upon the sublunary.In the Air we have pure spirit holding in leash thelust of the flesh. In water,the sublimating power ofsacrifice. Here in Fire, we are shown the cosmicforcesconcentrating on the pilgrim from all sides. Judgmentis pronounced uponhim. He is not the judge nor doesdecision rest in his hands. Lazarus cannotemerge fromthe Sepulchre until the voice cries out, “Come forth!”Nor can he castaside the conflicting grave-clothes untilthe command, “Loose him!” is given. Manof himselfis helpless. The impulse to ascend must come fromabove, but by itspower he may transcend the sepulchreof environment and cast aside the trammelsof desire.Here once more, the fiery energy of red burns throughthe planes. Fieryscarlet, glowing crimson, burning redare emphasized by the passive greens.XXL The Universe. Observe that this representsnot the World but the Universe. Itshould be remem-bered that to the ancients, Saturn represented the con-fines ofthe Solar system. They had no means ofmeasuring either Uranus or Neptune. Tothem, there-fore, Saturn passing through the spiral path of theZodiac, marked atits cardinal points by the symbolsof the Kerubim forming the Cross, was acomprehensiveglyph of the whole.Thus, in this card we find a synthesis of the wholeTaro or Rota. The centralfigure should be taken asHathor, Athor, or Ator, rather than Isis, thusindicatingthe hidden anagram which may perhaps be translatedthus: ORAT — manprays. ATOR — to the GreatMother. TARO—who turns. ROTA—the wheel of LifeandDeath.The colours like those of the Wheel of Fortune in-clude the colours of theSpectrum and those of the< 216 >elements, but they are placed against the indigo andblack of a Saturn, with thewhite gleam of the Starsshining in the darkness and the misty figure of theAimahElohim in the midst. In the practical Tarot,this card is taken to signify thematter in hand, that isthe subject of any question that has been asked.Having now revised the 22 Atous or Trumps insuccession, it will be wise for theStudent to reverse theprocess and seek to follow the Path of the Pilgrimfrombelow upwards, thus seeking to comprehend the interiorprocess of Initiationand Illumination. It is a process inwhich the whole Universe does not disdain totake part,for Man is himself the Microcosm of the Macrocosmand the Child of theGods. And again, the Macrocosmmust itself be undergoing a corresponding processinwhich the experience not only of humanity but of eacliindividual must be anintegral part. The fragments aregathered up into the baskets, that nothing maybe lost;and from the feeding of the multitude there remainsnot less but morethan the unbroken bread and fish—fit emblems of Earth and Water.Cease nor to seek day and night the PurifyingMysteries.(Note: This paper on the Trumps is not an officialdocument. It should beconceived rather in the natureof a so-called Side Lecture of Flying Roll. Thatis notto say that it is unimportant, or that there is little ofinterest therein.On the contrary, certain aspects of thisinterpretation are not without highsignificance. More-over, it should be carefully studied as well as thepre-ceding official Tarot instructions in conjunction withthe description ofcertain of the Trumps in the graderituals of the First Order.—I.R.)< 217 >THE TREE OF LIFEAS PROJECTEDIN A SOLID SPHERENOTE BY S.R.M.D.The Planets’ sphere which illustrates this manuscript,a part of the Z.A.M.’sAbstract of the Tarot, has beendrawn by S.R.M.D. as instructed. It representstheHeavens polarized on the plane of the Ecliptic, not onthe plane of theEquator of our Earth, so that its NorthPole is the veritable North Pole of ourHeavens andnot merely that part of them to which the North Poleof our Earth nowpoints.Another very important difference is that, through-out the true Tarot, theteaching assigns the commenc-ing Point of the Zodiac to the bright Star“Regulus”which is in Leo. And it measures Right Ascension andLongitude from thatpoint, and not from a suppositiouspoint divided by the Equinox and called the o°ofAries (though in reality now far removed from the con-stellation of thatname), which has been adopted bymodern or western astronomy and astrology.By this now usual way of reckoning, and the Proces-sion of the Equinoxes, it hasgradually come to passthat the signs (or divisions, each of 30°, of theZodiac)no longer coincide with the constellations of the samename, and eachdecade of years shows them slowly butsurely receding.But the Tarot method of reckoning from the starnamed Regulus has, it wri 11 beseen, the effect of makingthe Signs and the Constellations coincide.“Regulus” is also named Cor Leonis—“The Heart ofthe Lion.” “Regulus” means “Starof the Prince.”“Regulus” coincides with the position of the “heart” inthe figureof Leo upon the Star Maps.< 218 >(Note: The principia or fundamental ideas of thisastronomical view of the Tarotmay be found, at leastin its essential form, in the astronomical writingsofClaudius Ptolemy of Alexandria. Naturally, this ref-erence only concerns thesigns, constellations and otherastronomical divisions noted. The expansion ofthisscheme, and its allocation to other forms of universalPicture #37 [images/img_0037.bmp]NORTHERN HEMISPHEREsymbolism, such as the Tarot cards, Hebrew letters,and Enochian Tablets, has itsroots in the syntheticgenius of the Golden Dawn. The idea of projecting theTreeof Life into a solid sphere, having applicationamong other things to the starryheavens and the con-stellations, certainly is peculiar to this system alone.< 219 >Picture #38 [images/img_0038.bmp]Most of the fundamentals inhering in the other aspectsof the Golden Dawnteaching may be found in exotericoccult literature of past centuries. But, asagain I mustinsist, the peculiar practical application of them as ex-emplifiedin the Golden Dawn routine can nowhere elsebe found, save, of course, in otherauthentic esotericsystems. The student is urged to study this whole sec-SOUTHERN HEMISPHEREtion very thoroughly; it is well worth it. In the earlydays of the Order therewas a special group whichdevoted its time and energies to the study andapplica-tion of the principles involved herein. Incidentally, mayI point out howmuch light this particular instructionthrows on innumerable passages inBlavatsky’s “SecretDoctrine”—especially in Volume II.—I.R.)< 220 >Tabular View of the Dominion of the Symbols ofBook T in the Celestial Heavens,and of the Operation,and Rule of The Tree of Life in the same as Projectedon aSolid Sphere. (Abridged Treatise arranged for theuse of the Z.A.M.’s in Angliaby S.R.M.D.)The Zelator Adeptus Minor shall know that the great“King Star” or “Heart of theLion,” which is in Leoupon the path of the Ecliptic and one of the“FourTiphareth Points” (see later) of the Celestial Heavens,is the commencementand Ruler of all our reckoning ofLongitude (or Ecliptic).

When, oh Lord of the Universe, shall she turnfrom her evil ways sothat she shall again beholdKether? Wherefore she is now a place of trial. Foreachthing in this world of Assiah looketh towards that whichis its NaturalGovernor, and to what part of the Celes-tial Heavens the Kether of a Planetconstantlylooketh, by that part is that Planet ruled. For in allthings shine theSephiroth even as hath been sufficientlysaid.The Four Knaves (Princesses) rule the celestialHeavens from the North Pole ofthe Zodiac to the 45Jof Latitude North of the Ecliptic. They form theThrones ofthe Four Aces, who rule in Kether, The FourKings, 4 Queens, 4 Princes rule theCelestial Heavensfrom the 450 of North Latitude down to the Ecliptic.The 12Tarot Keys attributed to the 12 Signs of theZodiac form the Celestial Heavensfrom the Ecliptic,down to the 450 of South Latitude. The 36 smallercards -of theSuits (from two to ten) rule the CelestialHeavens from the 450 South of theEcliptic to theSouth Pole, or the Malkuth place therein.

The centreis the most pronounced in its accord with the natureof itsRuler, and the two outer portions are tingedwith the nature of the Ruler of thedominion borderingthereon. For example, in the case of Leo, the DominionofFortitude, the central io degrees will have most ofthis nature. For thebeginning ten degrees are tingedwith the nature of Cancer, and the last tendegrees withthe nature of Virgo, the nature of Leo however pre-dominating themixture.The whole Heavens then, are thus divided into FourGreat Belts or Zones:The Uppermost being the Dominion of the Knaveslike a Cross within a Circle.The Second Belt under the Dominion of the otherCourt cards represents a Belt ofInfluencedescending vertically.The Third Belt under the Dominion of the 12 Keysrelated to the Signs of theZodiac, representsa Belt of Influence acting horizontally. ThisZone in unionwith the second Belt will there-fore yield a great Zone of 12 Crossesencirclingthe heavens.The Fourth Belt consists of 36 Decans under theDominion of the 36 small cards ofthe foursuits, the numbers 2—10 of each suit. In eachof these sets of 3 parts ofa Sign, the centralone will be more pronounced in effect than thelateral parts.Therefore the 3 Decanates of each of the Signs willbe symbolised by a triangle.Thus are yielded twelve< 229 >Triangles surrounding the lower heavens, and thereforethere will ultimate twelveCrosses surmounting 12 Tri-angles surrounding the heavens. In other words,thesymbol of the G.D. in the Outer, 12 times repeated.Influence of the 12 Court CardsPicture #39 [images/img_0039.bmp]Hidden Sun of Tiphareth operating andrising above the Waters of SpaceAnd the central Rising Sun will represent the hiddeninfluence of Tiphareth inthe centre of the Sphere, aswill be hereafter explained, rising above the watersofSpace (the ethereal expanse of the Sky called by theEgyptians “The Waters ofNu which are the parents ofthe Gods,” The Shoreless Ocean of Space).But in the Golden Dawn initiation, the Cross sur-mounting the Triangle ispreferably represented by aCalvary Cross of 6 Squares, as still more alliedtoTiphareth.< 230 >OF THE OPERATION AND RULE OFTHE TREE OF LIFEIN THE CELESTIAL HEAVENS PROJECTED AS IF INA SOLID SPHEREWhen the Tree of Life is considered not as being aplane but as a solid figure,and when it is projected, inthe Sphere, the North Pole of the Sphere willcoincidewith Kether, and the South Pole with Malkuth.And as we have before sufficiently learned the TenSephiroth are repeated notalone, in each whole figure,but also in the parts therefore, so that everymaterialthing created, will have its own Sephiroth and Paths.Now as the North Pole corresponds with Kether,and the South Pole correspondswith Malkuth, thecentral Pillar of the Sephirotic Tree will form the in-visibleAxis of the Sphere, the Central point coincidingwith Tiphareth. This latterSephirah together with thatof Yesod will be completely hidden from view, sothatTiphareth will be the exact centre of the Sphere.Also the Sephiroth Chokmah, Binah, Chesed, Ge-burah, Netsach and Hod will beduplicated. As alsothe Paths, Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Vau, Cheth, Caph,Mem, Qoph,and Shin, and so many of the others willbe even quadrupled. But althoughTiphareth andYesod will be concealed, there will be four especialpoints wherethe influence of each will be indicated.As projected in the before-described Celestial Sphere,Kether will govern aRadius of io° around the NorthPole, thus embracing the whole body of theConstella-tion Draco.Chokmah will be on the 6o° North Latitude; em-bracing a radius of io°, the rightfoot of Hercules; theleft arm, hand, and part of head of Bootes. Also ontheother side of the Heavens, a radius of io° includingthe head and shoulders ofCephus, and the head ofLacerta.Binah, has a similar radius and is posited on thesame parallel of Latitudes, andincludes the pole Star< 231 >of the Earth, the head of Camelopardelus, the tip of thetail of Draco; also Lyraand left knee of Hercules inthe opposite side of the Heavens.Ckesed with a similar radius, and posited in the 30°of North Latitude, willinclude part of Coma Berenices,of Bootes, and of Virgo, and parts of Andromedaandof Pegasus.And so with the other Sephiroth of the outer Pillars,each being 30“ distant fromthe line of the Sephirothabove and below it, and having a radius of io°.The central line of the Two Pillars of Mercy andSeverity will respectivelytraverse, that of Mercy the150 of Virgo and 15° of Pisces; that of Severity the15°of Gemini and the 150 of Sagittarius, The four Yesodpoints will be on theline of the 6o° of South Latitude,and at similar Zodiacal points. From whichcircum-stances the path of Influence or nature of the Sun willbe along the lineof the Ecliptic, coinciding withTiphareth, and that of the Moon will be on the600 ofSouth Latitude answering to the Yesod points onthat line.< 232 >S.

Clearly, it requiresfurther teaching thoroughly to beunderstood, butstudents who have a good working knowledge of Astrol-ogy, as wellas an understanding of the theory of theTattwa tides or currents, will find thatthis documentthrows much light on the esoteric system ofAstrologicaldivination.—I.R.)In the Book “T,” it is written: “Also the Dragon(i.e. Draco, the constellationat the Northern pole ofthe Heavens) surroundeth the Pole Kether of theCelestialHeavens.” It is further laid down that theFour Aces, (symbolised by thePrincesses and Ama-zons), rule the Celestial Heavens from the NorthernPole ofthe Zodiac unto the 45th Degree of LatitudeNorth of the Ecliptic, and from theThrones of theFour Aces which rule in Kether.And again it is stated that:The Throne of the Ace of Cups The head of DragoThe Throne of the Ace of Swords... .Fore part of bodyThe Throne of the Ace ofPentacles. .Hind part of bodyThe Throne of the Ace of Wands Tail of DracoRegard thou then the form of this Constellation ofthe Dragon. It is convolutedin the four places answer-ing unto the rule of the Aces.Head, First convolution Ace of CupsSecond convolution Ace of SwordsThird convolution Ace of PentaclesFourth convolution Ace of Wands< 236 >And this convoluted course will represent the Law ofthe Aces.Now in the Four Faces of YHVH, Fire and Water becontrary, and also Earth and Airbe contrary. And thethrone of the Element will attract and seize, as it were,theForce of that element, so that herein be the Forcesof Antipathy and of Sympathy,or what are knownchemically as attraction and repulsion.Recall also the allotment of the Triplicites:Aries, Leo, Sagittarius = Fire = Wands of the Tarot.Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces =Water — Cups of the Tarot.Gemini, Libra, Aquarius = Air — Swords of theTarot.Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn — Earth = Pentacles of theTarot.Now, the order of the Princesses, and consequentlyof the Thrones, is formed fromright to left thus:Heh (final)VauHehYodPrincessPrincessPrincessPrincessof, ofofofPentaclesSwordsCupsWandsTaurusAquariusScorpioLeoEarthAirWaterFireWhile that of the Aces isformed from left to right,though their motion is from right to left:YodHehVauHeh (final)AceAceAceAceofofofofWandsCupsSwordsPentaclesThis, then will be the order of their movement. Letus first supposethe aces onthe following stations:Station 2Station 1Station 12Station 11Ace ofAce ofAce ofAce ofWands Cups Swords PentaclesNow the Station 2 is the Throne of the Ace of Wands,while the movement of theAces is steadily from rightto left in the direction of the numbering of thestations.In the ordinary course the Ace of Wands would passto Station 3; the Aceof Cups to Station 2; the Ace ofSwords to Station 1; the Ace of Pentacles toStation 12.< 237 >But the Station 2, being the Throne of the Ace ofWands, attracts and arrests themovement of thatForce so that instead of passing into Station 3, it re-mains onStation 2 until the other Aces have passedover it in turn.Ace of Wands remains on Station 2,Ace of Cups passes also on to Station 2,Ace of Swords passes on to Station 1,Ace of Pentacles passes on to Station 12.Again,Ace of Cups passes to StationAce of Wands remains at Station 2,Ace of Swords passes also on to Station 2,Ace of Pentacles passes also on to Station 1.Again,Ace of Cups passes on to Station 4,Ace of Swords passes on to Station 3,Ace of Wands remains at Station 2,Ace of Pentacles passes also on to Station 2.Again,Ace of Cups passes to Station 5,Ace of Swords passes to Station 4,Ace of Pentacles passes on to Station 3,Ace of Wands still remains on Station 2.But Station 5 is the Throne of the Ace of Cups.Therefore it attracts and arreststhat Force, in thesame manner that the Throne of the Ace of Wandsactedpreviously in attracting and arresting the Ace ofWands, the result of which hasbeen to make thatForce which previously was leading become the lastof the Four.Again,Ace of Cups remains on Station 5,Ace of Swords passes also on to Station 5,Ace of Pentacles passes also on to Station 4,Ace of Wands, now at last passes into Station 3.For it has now become the last of the Four, and theAce of Cups has commenced toact through its Throne,and the Ace of Pentacles, moving to Station 4, a hiatus< 238 >would occur in the movement of the Aces, if the Ace ofWands did not move forwardto Station 3, and alsothere is the attraction of the motion of those Acesinfront of it. Wherefore all these Forces combining, atlength cause it to moveforward.The movement then continues, thus:The Ace of Swords passes on to Station 6,The Ace of Cups remains on Station 5,The Ace of Pentacles passes also on to Station 5,The Ace of Wands passes also onto Station 4.Again,The Ace of Swords passes on to Station 7,The Ace of Pentacles passes on to Station 6,The Ace of Cups still remains on Station 5,The Ace of Wands passes also on to Station 5.Again,The Ace of Swords passes on to Station 8, itsThrone,The Ace of Pentacles passes on to Station 7,The Ace of Wands passes on to Station 6,The Ace of Cups still remains on Station 5.Again,The Ace of Swords remains on Station 8,The Ace of Pentacles passes also on to Station 8,The Ace of Wands passes on toStation 7,The Ace of Cups now at length passes on to Sta-tion 6, and so on.The movement of the Aces will be very similar to theconvolutions of Draco thus:The Course of the Aces:S——Throne^ s.Swords7.16,Throne5.Cups4. 3.!i£>ThH| WandsHAnd will imply a much more sustained exercise offorce through the Thrones thanelsewhere. So that thegeneric effect of the Thrones will be that of theseasons,while the other stations will give the variations thereof< 239 >Table showing the Order of the Passage of the 4 Aces,above the Signs, in thedominion of the Princesses.5i<jrxThrorvzoffirstinOrderSecondJn.0 rd erThirdinOrderfourtkinOrderMoveablerVAVAfixedttAce offfcn tacksVAVACommor\\nAVAVM.0AVAVhjftAce ofW^ndsAVAVC.TtyVAVAM.AAVAVAf~.TTUAce ofCups !VAVAC.x77A*VAVM.Y5AVAVFrAce ofSwordsAVAVC.XVAVA< 240 >in accordance with their natures and with the order ofthe movement of the acesin them.And as Kether acted directly upon Tiphareth whichis, as it were, the centre andfocus of the Sephirothwhen projected in a sphere, so do the Aces act uponthe Sunas the centre and focus of the Solar System.So that the Sun, according to hisposition with regardto the Equinox and the Earth’s surface will translatetheeffect of the seasons, he being the translator of theforce of heat thereto,whether the then postion of theEquinoctial points coincide with what we call o°Aries,and o° Libra (reckoning from Regulus) or not. So thathis effect North ofthe Equator shall produce whenjust leaving the Equinoctial point, the effect ofAries,whether he be with that constellation actually in theheavens or not.Conversely also, for the South of the Equator (as inthe country of Australia)his quitting the Equinoctialpoint southward will translate the same effect ofAries.But this rule shall not for one moment affirm thatAries and Libra are identicalin nature. Nor that theZodiac proper is inoperative. Nor that the nature oftheSun is not modified by the constellation in which he is.But only that thedirect effect of the physical impactof his rays falling upon a certain portionof the earth’ssurface, will be in proportion to the duration of theiraction, inthe excitement they produce in the terrestrialforces.And now as the Forces symbolized by these Aces,pass in succession over thesestations, so will theyawake certain terrestrial action according unto the signofthe division of the Zodiac above which they pass inthe domain of the Knaves ofPrincesses, and accordingunto the nature thereof. Nevertheless, the forcerousedby the Ace when on its Throne will be of longer dura-tion than at otherpoints.And hence it is that the Signs of the Zodiac bedivided into Fixed or Kerabic,Moveable or changing,and Common or fluctuating, according unto the nature< 241 >of the power which can be awakened therein. Andagain, these will be variedaccording unto their Ele-ments, for the Elements have a various classification.NOTE BY S.R.M.D.I think it is here advisable to transcribe the followingfrom Cornelius Agrippa:“Of The Four Elements and Their Natural Qualities:“It is necessary that we should know and understandthe nature and quality of theFour Elements, in orderto our being perfect in the principles and groundworkofour studies in the Talismanic or Magical Art.“Therefore, there are four Elements, the originalgrounds of all corporealthings, viz.: Earth, Air, Fire,and Water, of which elements all inferior bodiesarecompounded, not by way of being heaped up together,but by transmutation andunion; and when they aredestroyed, they are resolved into elements.“But there are none of the sensible elements that arepure. But they are more orless mixed, and apt to bechanged the one into the other, even as earthbeingmoistened and dissolved becomes water, but the samebeing made thick andhard becomes earth again, andbeing evaporated through heat it passes into air,andthat being kindled into fire; and this being extinguishedinto air again; butbeing cooled after burning becomeswater again, or else stone or sulphur, andthis is clearlydemonstrated by lightning.“Now every one of these Elements has two specificqualities: the former whereofit retains as proper toitself; in the other as a mean, it agrees with thatwhichcomes directly after it. For Fire is hot and dry; Watercold and moist; andAir hot and moist; and so in thismanner, the Elements, according to two contraryquali-ties are opposite one to the other, as Fire to Water, andEarth to Air.“Likewise the Elements are contrary one to the otheron another account. Two areheavy, as Earth andWater; and the others are light, as Fire and Air. There-< 242 >TABLE SHOWING QUALITIESOF ELEMENTSA Heat, dryness, excessive lightness, brilliance,excessive subtlety, motionrapid.V Cold, moisture, weight, obscurity,solidity, motion.A Heat, moisture, lightness, slight obscurity,subtlety, excessive motion.V Cold, dryness, excessive weight, excessiveobscurity, excessive solidity, rest.TABLE SHOWING THE QUALITIES OF THEELEMENTS WHEN MIXED IN PAIRSA & V Slight weight, some subtlety, intense andrapid motion.A & A Great heat, intense lightness, slight brilliance,intense subtlety, intensemotion.A & V Great dryness, slight obscurity.V & A Great moisture, intense motion.V & V Great cold, intense weight, intense obscurity,intense solidity.A & V Some weight, intense obscurity, little solidity,little motion.< 243 >fore the stoics called the former ‘passives,’ but the latter‘actives.’ And Platodistinguishes them after anothermanner, and assigns to each of them threequalities,viz.: To the Fire brightness, thinness and motion. Tothe Earth,darkness, thickness, and quietness. And ac-cording to these qualities theElements of Fire andEarth are contrary. Now the other Elements borrowtheirqualities from these, so that the Air receives twoqualities from the Fire,thinness and motion, and fromthe Earth one, darkness. In like manner, Waterreceivestwo qualities from the Earth, darkness and thickness;and from the Fireone, motion. But Fire is twice as thinas Air, thrice more moveable, and fourtimes lighter.The Air is twice more bright, thrice more thin, andfour times moremoveable than Water. Therefore, asFire is to Air, so is Air to Water, and Waterto Earth.And again, as the Earth is to the Water, so is Water toAir, and Air toFire. And this is the root and foundationof all bodies, natures, and wonderfulworks. And he whocan know and thoroughly understand these qualitiesof theElements and their mixtures shall bring to passwonderful and astonishing thingsin Magic.“Now each of these Elements has a threefold consider-ation, so that the numberof four may make up thenumber of twelve; and by passing by the number ofseveninto ten, there may be a progress to the SupremeUnity upon which all virtue andwonderful things dodepend. Of the first Order, are the pure Elements, whichareneither compounded, changed, nor mixed, but areincorruptible and not of whichbut through which thevirtues of all natural things are brought forth to act.Noman is fully able to declare their Virtues, becausethey can do all things uponall things. Fie who remainsignorant of these, shall never be able to bring topassany wonderful matter.“Of the second order are Elements that are com-pounded, changeable and impure,yet such as may, byart, be reduced to their pure simplicity, whose virtue,whenthey are thus reduced, doth above all things,< 244 >perfect all occult and common operations of Nature;and these are the foundationsof the whole of naturalMagic.“Of the third Order are those elements which original-ly and of themselves arenot elements, but are twicecompounded, various, and changeable untoanother.These are the infallible medium, and are called theMiddle Nature, orSoul of the Middle Nature; veryfew there are that understand the deep mysteriesthere-of. In them is, by means of certain numbers, degreesand orders, theperfection of every effect in what thingsoever, whether natural, celestial, orswper-celestial.They are full of wonders and mysteries, and are opera-tive inMagic, natural or divine. For, from these,through them, proceeds the binding,loosing, and trans-mutation of all things—the knowledge and foretellingof thingsto come, also the expelling of evil and thegaining of Good Spirits. Let no one,therefore, withoutthese three sorts of Elements, and the true knowledgethereof,be confident that he can work anything in theoccult science of Magic and Nature.“But whosoever shall know how to reduce those of oneorder into another, impureinto pure, compounded intosimple, and shall understand distinctly thenature,virtue, and power of them, into number, degrees andorder, withoutdividing the substance, he shall easilyattain to the knowledge and perfectoperation of allnatural things, and celestial secrets likewise; and thisis theperfection of the Qabalah, which teaches all thesebefore mentioned; and by aperfect knowledge thereof,we perform many rare and wonderful experiments. Intheoriginal and exemplary world all things are all inall. So also in this corporealworld. And the elementsare not only in these inferior things; but are intheHeavens, in stars, in devils, in angels, and likewise inGod Himself, themaker and original example of allthings.“Now it must be understood that in these inferiorbodies the elements are grossand corruptible, but in< 245 >the heavens they are, with their natures and virtues,after a celestial and moreexcellent manner than insublunary things. For the firmness of the celestialearthis there without the grossness of water, and the agilityof Air withoutexceeding its bounds. The heat of firewithout burning, only shining, givinglight and life toall things by its celestial heat.”End of transcription.Now the successive effect of the passage of the Acesover the Stations above theplace of a Sign in the ex-citement of the Forces of that Sign may bereadilycalculated by the tables of the qualities of the elementssimple andmixed, always being careful to take alsointo account the effect of the Throneupon the Seasonas well, and the nature of the Sign.It is said that Kether is in Malkuth, and again, thatMalkuth is in Kether butafter another manner.For downwards through the Four Worlds the Mal-kuth of the less material will belinked unto the Ketherof the more material. From the Synthesis of theTencorruscations of the AOUR (Light) proceedeth theinfluence unto EHEIEH, theKether of Atziluth. Andthe connecting thread of the AIN SOPH is extendedthroughthe worlds of the Ten Sephiroth and is in everydirection. As the Ten Sephirothoperate in eachSephiroth, so will there be a KETHER in every MAL-KUTH, andMalkuth in every Kether. Thus:ADONAI MELEKH will be the MALKUTH ofATZILUTHMETATRON will be the KETHER of BRIAH.SANDALPHONMETRATON will be the MALKUTH ofNEPHESCH ha- BRIAH.MESSIAHCHAIOTH ha QADESH will be the KETHER ofYETZIRAH.ASCHIM will be the MALKUTH of YETZIRAH.< 246 >RASIIITH ha GILGALIM, the KETHER ofASSIAH.CHOLEM YESODOTH, the MALKUTH ofASSIAH.THAUMIEL, the KETHER of the QLIPPOTH.The symbol of the connection between MALKUTHof YETSIRAH and KETHER of ASSIAHwill be of aform somewhat resembling that of an hour glass. Thethread of the AINSOPH before alluded to, traversingthe centre thereof, and forming the AIN SOPHcon-nection between the Worlds:Picture #44 [images/img_0044.bmp]So that the symbol of the connection between thetwo planes is this. And also themodus operandi of thetranslation of force from one plane into another is inthis,and hence doth the title of the Sphere of Ketherof Assiah signify thecommencement of a whirlingmotion.Now also, in the diagram of Minutum Mundum,there be four colours attributed untoMalkuth. Citrine,russet, olive, and black. And if we consider them as inavertical sphere, we shall find citrine uppermost andhorizontal, russet and olivemidmost and vertical, blacklowermost and horizontal.And again, these four represent in a manner theoperation of the four elements inMalkuth; for example:Citrine—Air of Earth Russet—Fire of EarthOlive—Water of Earth Black—Earth of Earth< M7 >From the diagram of the hour glass symbol it will bemanifest then that MALKUTHof YETZIRAH willbe the transmitter of the Yetsiratic forces untoKETHER ofASSIAH, and that the latter will be therecipient thereof, and that theHour-glass symbol ordouble cone, will be the translator from the one planeuntothe other. Here, therefore, let us consider theYetsiratic nomenclature of theTenth Path answeringunto Malkuth, and of the First Path answering untoKether.The Tenth Path: It is called the Resplendent Intelli-gence and it is so-calledbecause it is exalted aboveevery head, and sitteth on the Throne of Binah, anditilluminateth the splendour of all the Lights, and itcauseth the current ofInfluence to flow from the Princeof Countenances, i.e. Metatron.The First Path: It is called the Wonderful or HiddenIntelligence (The HighestCrown) for it is the Lightto cause to understand the Primordial withoutcom-mencement, and it is the Primal Glory, for nothing cre-ated is worthy tofollow out its essence.Whence it is plain that MALKUTH is, as it were,the collector together andsynthesis of all the forces inits plane or world. While KETHER being superioruntoall else in its plane or world, will be the recipient andarranger of theforces from the plane beyond, so as todistribute them unto its subordinateSephiroth in aduly ordered manner.And therefore any force of the multitudinous andinnumerable forces in Malkuthmay act through theupper cone of the hourglass symbol, and by means ofthe lowerone translate its operation into KETHERbelow, but its mode of transmission willbe through thecones by the thread of the Ain Soph, or of the Un-formulated.So that in the transmission of force between twoworlds the Formulate must firstbecome Unformulate,ere it can reformulate in new conditions. For it must be< H8 >plain that a force formulated in one world, if translatedinto another will beunformulated, according to the lawsof a plane different in nature. Even as waterin itsfluid state will be subject to different laws to thosegoverning it when inthe conditions of either ice orsteam.And as before said, there being in the MinutumMundum diagram four chiefelemental divisions of theSephira MALKUTH, each of these will have itscor-relative formula of transmission unto the succeedingKether. Hence also inthe Order Tarot teaching is therethe Dominion of the four Knaves or Princessesof theTarot pack around the North Pole. Why then is it thatit is the FourAmazons or Knaves, answering unto thefinal Heh of YHVH, that are here placed,rather thanthe Four Kings, Queens or Princes, or one of eachnature?We are taught that these are the Vice Regents of theName in the Four Worlds, andthat they are thusattributed among the Sephiroth.Yod Heh Vau Heh (final)Chokmah Binah Tiphareth MalkuthKing Queen Prince PrincessNow as Kether of Assiah is to receive from Malkuthof Yetsirah, it is necessarythat in and about Ketherthere should be a force which partaketh of the natureofMalkuth, though more subtle and refined in nature.And therefore is it that thefinal Heh, or Princess force,have their dominion placed about Kether. They aresoplaced that they may attract from the Malkuth of theHigher and form the basisof action for the Aces. Sothat a refined matter may attract its like, andthespiritual forces may not lose themselves in the void, toproduce but amistaken and whirling destruction forwant of a settled basis. And herein is themutualformula in all things, of a spirit and of a body, seeingthat each suppliesunto each that wherein the otheris lacking, yet herein also must there be acertain con-< 249 >dition, otherwise the harmony will not be perfect. Forunless the body be refinedin nature, it will hinder theaction of a spirit cognate unto it. And unless thespiritbe willing to ally itself unto the body, the latter willDiagram showing the convoluted transmission ofthe 4 forces from Malkuth toKctherPicture #45 [images/img_0045.bmp]Dotted lines show the natural lines at transmissionof the Forces, were bothSephiroth in the sameWorld, Lines of dashes show the mode in whichthese linesare caught and convoluted by the Hour-Glass symbolbe injured thereby and each will mutually react onthe other.1 herefore, also, let the Adeptus Minor understandthat there may be fault of thespirit as well as of the< 250 >body, and that there is little difference between thematerial and sensuousperson, and the envious, mali-cious and self-righteous person—save that fromtheirbeing more subtle and less evident, the sins of the latterare moreinsidious than those of the former, thoughboth are alike evil. But it is asnecessary to govern theSpirit as to refine the body, and of what use is ittoweaken the body by abstinence, if at the same timeuncharitableness andspiritual pride are encouraged!It is simply translating one sin into another.And therefore are the final Heh forces so necessaryin Kether, as it is said inthe Tenth Path of the SepherYetsirah: “It is so called because it is exaltedaboveevery head, and sitteth on the Throne of Binah.” Now,in the Tree, the twoSephiroth, Chokmah and Binah,are referred unto the Briatic World which is alsocalledthe Throne or vehicle, that is of the Atzilutic Worldunto which latterKether is referred on the Tree. Andreferring unto the dominions of the FourPrincesses,thou shalt find that in the sphere they includeChokmah and Binah aswell as Kether.Now there will be, not one, but four formulae of theapplication of the FourForces of Malkuth, unto therevolution of the Aces in Kether, and these actingnotsingly but simultaneously and with a different degreeof force.Were Malkuth or Kether in the same plane or worldthe transmission of theseforces from the one unto theother would proceed more or less in direct lines. Inthiscase, seeing that Malkuth and Kether be in differentplanes or worlds, thelines of transmission of these forcesare caught up and whirled about by theupper cone ofthe hour glass symbol into the vortex where throughpasseth thethread of the unformulaled, i.e. the AinSoph. Thence they are projected in awhirling convolu-tion (yet according unto their nature) through thelower cone ofthe hourglass symbol unto Kether.Whence it resulteth that these formulae are of thenature of the Dragon, that isto say, moving in con-< 251 >volutions, and hence they are called the Dragon orSerpent Formulae.Now imagining MALKUTH of Yetzirah to be in avertical position above Kether ofAssiah, it will beplain that the whole of the black part of Malkuth willbetowards Kether, but only a portion of the russetand olive parts, and that thecitrine parts will be en-tirely removed and on the further side. Whereforethenatural operation of these four forces towards Ketherwill be: black, ratherhorizontal than vertical, and act-\\ 'Hour Gloss SyrntaolCor\\e \\CoAe /// lower/fyy} >-■;>* *; - .r:wi<p ** *^ -Je)T ■'n *: oDIRECT OR CREEPING FORMULAing fully. Citrine rather horizontal than vertical butacting at the edge of thecircumference of Kether, andslightly rather than strongly. Russet and oliverathervertical than horizontal, and acting moderately.Now these four formulae will imply four simultaneous< 252 >movements in the revolution of the forces symbolisedby the four aces round theNorthern Pole,The first and most forcible in its immediate actionwill be that answering untothe Earth of Malkuth ofYetzirah, transmitting unto Kether of Assiah, andfol-lowing the convolutions of the Constellation Draco. Itis called the Director Creeping Formula and for thisreason the Dragon may be wingless and footed asre-gards its symbolic representation. This formula hasbeen thoroughly explainedin the beginning of thissection on the revolution of the Aces. In theexpressionsEarth of Malkuth, etc., it should be remembered thatthese do notimply pure but mixed elemental natures,seeing that Malkuth receiveth theultimate effect of allthe forces in the Tree of Life, even as the colourswhichbe attributed thereto be not primaries, but tertiaries.Therefore eachelement in Malkuth will be counter-changed with others, even as the Kerubim intheKcrubim in the Vision of Ezekiel have each, not onebut four heads andcounterchanged.The second and least forcible in its immediate actionwill be the Dragon formulaanswering unto the Air ofMalkuth of Yetsirah, transmitting unto Kether ofAssiah,and following the convolutions of four serpentsupon the four triplicities of theelements in the Zodiacor more properly speaking, upon the stations intheDominions of the Princesses above them. (Now alsothe Throne in each Dominionis marked in the Book Tas embracing more than a third of each dominion,becauseof the enduring effect of its force.) This formulais also called the looped orFlying Formula, and hencethe serpents may be represented footless, butwinged.Its action is more round the circumference at its edge,than that of theother formulae. This formula of opera-tions will be readily understood onreference to thediagram thereof, but more especially from the fourdiagramsshowing the change of order and course ofthe aces. In this formula the heads ofthe four serpentswill be above the four cardinal signs.< 253 >The Third Dragon Formula, moderately forcible inits immediate action, is thatanswering unto the Fire ofMalkut hof Yetzirah, transmitting unto KetherofAssiah, and following the law of the attraction andrepulsion of the elementsof the triplicities of theZodiac. This is also called the Leaping orDartingFormula, and its serpents may be represented bothfooted and winged—footedto represent the attractionof the elements, winged to represent the repulsionbythe contrary elements.

This formula will be readily under-stood from the four diagramsthereof and also fromthose showing the change of order in the course of theAces.As before the heads of the serpents rest upon theStations above the CardinalSigns.The explanation of the course of one of the fourserpents will be sufficient toexplain the whole. Let us< 254 >take that of Fire:Fire is strongly attracted by the Station aboveFire,Fire is strongly repelled by the Station aboveWater,Fire is slightly attracted by the Station above Air,Fire is slightly repelled bythe Station above Earth.(The attraction and repulsion of the Serpent of theEarth Triplicity only* isshown in this diagram toavoid confusion.)Picture #46 [images/img_0046.bmp]The Head rests on the Station above Aries.The Serpent is repelled into the lower Cone byPisces,The Serpent is slightly attracted by Aquarius,The Serpent is slightly attracted by Capricorn,< 255 >The Serpent is strongly attracted by Sagittarius,The Serpent is stronglyrepelled by Scorpio,The Serpent is slightly attracted by Libra,The Serpent is slightly attracted by Virgo,The Serpent is strongly attracted by Leo,The Serpent is strongly repelled by Cancer,The Serpent is slightly attracted by Gemini andTaurus.The tail is strongly attracted by Aries, where it isunited with the head again.(The course of the FourSerpents is shown in four different diagrams toavoidconfusion.)Picture #47 [images/img_0047.bmp]REVOLVING OR FLOWING FORMULAThe fourth Dragon Formula and moderately forcible,is that answering unto theWater of MALKUTH ofYetsirah, transmitting into the Kether of Assiah,andfollowing the Law of the Zodiacal succession of theSigns in gradual Order.This is also called the Revolvingor Flowing Formula, and its serpent may berepre-sented neither winged nor footed, but with fins to< 256 >symbolise its flowing movement. This formula will bemore vertical in action, andcan be readily understoodfrom the diagram thereof, and from those showingthechange of order in the course of the Aces.This formula may be best symbolically representedby the four Aces revolving asin a smaller wheel upona great circle whose body is composed of the powers ofthetwelve Signs, so that this latter in its turn revolvesupon the stations abovethe Zodiac. The effect of therevolution of the Wheel of the Aces will be toexciteby the Ace of Wands the Fiery Signs, by the Ace ofCups the Watery Signs,by the Ace of Swords the AirySigns, and by the Ace of Pentaclcs the EarthySigns.Yet through the forces of the revolution of the Serpentas well, the forcesof the Aces will be in their turnmodified by the zodiacal natures in the body oftheSerpent.And as before said the action of these formulae willbe simultaneous thoughdiffering in degree, and of themall that first explained which followeth theconvolu-tions of the Constellation Draco is the strongest inoperation. And it isto be noted that in two of theseformulae, the heads of the Serpents are with theOrderof the Signs, and in the other two against the naturalorder of successionof them in the Zodiac.Also the action of the Spirit of Malkuth of Yetsirahtransmitting unto Kether ofAssiah will equal that ofcontinued vibratory rays, acting from the centre tothecircumference, and thus bringing into action the forcefrom the “Thread of theUnformulate” MEZLA.Recall that which is written in the Chapter of theChariot—(Ezekiel, I. 45.)“And I beheld, and lo! a tempestuous whirlwind cameout from the North, a mightycloud, and a fire violentlywhirling upon itself, and a splendour revolvinguponitself, and from the midmost as an eye of brightnessfrom the midst of thefire. And from the midmost theforms of the Four Chaioth.”< 257 >BOOK NINETHEA NG E L I CTABLETSINTRODUCTIONTO THEENOCH IAN SYSTEMBy Fratke Ad Majorem Adonai GloriamTo the First Order of the Golden Dawn little wassaid of the Angelic Tablets orWatch Towers. Theywere mentioned in the Grade Rituals but their subjectmatterdid not enter into the Knowledge Lecturesdirectly. But the detailed study of theTablets and themethod of using them with the Enochian invocationsfor skrying inthe Spirit-Vision formed a definite partof the course of work prescribed for theAdeptus Minorof the R.R. et A.C., though I have never met anybodywho had done itwith any degree of thoroughness.There was a considerable mass of detailed and highlycomplex instruction on thissubject, contained in anumber of documents. There are in mypossessionmanuscripts totalling at least 70,000 words, besidessome large charts,diagrams and coloured boards.Therefore it has been found necessary to provideapaper which attempts to cover the whole ground inlogical sequence givingquotations where necessaryfrom the original documents of G.H. FraterD.D.C.F.This probably will be of more general use than repro-ducing the wholerather disconnected mass of Enochianliterature, which in many cases is simply adevelopmentof the fundamentals, and thus can be worked up byeach individualreader who studies this book.< 260 >At the outset, let it be said that a good deal ofsystematic study will berequired to appreciate thevalue and subtle significance of this system. It isoneof the most amazing magical schemes that I have everencountered, since itprovides a thorough-going andcomprehensive synthesis of the entire magicalsystemof the Golden Dawn. Every important item of knowl-edge and practice founditself incorporated within thescope of these Angelic Tablets] Every worth-whiletech-nical form of Magical procedure and all branches ofritualistic work findthemselves represented in a singlenoble system.Therefore, because it is a synthetic amalgamation ofall the Order Work, thestudent will find it necessaryand imperative to have made himselfthoroughlyfamiliar with all the other items of knowledge taughtby the GoldenDawn. He must know his Tarot andGcomantic attributions so well that the names,symbolsand ideas are all at his finger tips—this, naturally, inaddition to thebasic knowledge items of the HebrewAlphabet, Tree of Life, and the Qabalahgenerally. Theformulae of practical Magic derived from the Z docu-ments, dealingwith the symbolism of the Candidate,the Temple, and the Ceremony of the NeophyteGrade,will require to be not only memorised and known, butunderstood. Thestudent will need to be perfectly ac-quainted with the Pentagram and HexagramRituals,the formulae of the Consecration Ceremonies, the gen-eral art ofinvocation, and formulating Telesmaticimages, and drawing Sigils. The Tabletsare excellentinstances of Talismans and Flashing Tablets.D. D. C. F. says in his Notanda to the Book of theConcourse of the Forces, that“the tablets of Enochrequire in truth many years of study, and will repaysuch anexpenditure of time and energy. The knowledgeembodied in this manuscript is verysuperficial andelementary, and entirely fails to do justice to theEnochianscheme. You must take it as only a feebleattempt to provide what is seen atfirst glance, by the< 261 >intellect, and as having no relation to the world ofSpiritual truth which theTablets enshrine and whicha high Adept can make them give out.”Very little is known about the origin of these Tabletsand the invocations thataccompany their use. Prac-tically nothing was said in the Order whichexplainedthis matter, though in the Adeptus Minor Ritual it issaid thatChristian Rosenkreutz and his immediatecolleagues, whose supposed date is circa1400 A.D.,transcribed some “of the magical language, which isthat of theElemental Tablets.” So far as we are ableto make out, however, the Systemoriginated by meansof the ceremonial skrying of Dr. John Dee and SirEdward Kellytowards the close of the 16th century.The original diaries of Dr. John Dee,recording thedevelopment of the system, may be found in SloaneManuscripts3189-3191 in the British Museum. Butthis stands out very clearly, that in thesediaries is arudimentary scheme which bears only the most distantrelation to theextraordinarily developed system in useby the Order. Whoever was responsible forthe Orderscheme of the Angelic Tablets—whether it was Mathersand Westcott or theGerman Rosicrucian Adepts fromwhom the former are supposed to have obtainedtheirknowledge—was possessed of an ingenuity and anunderstanding of Magic suchas never was in the pos-session either of Dee or Kelly.Some of the Order clairvoyants have claimed thatDee and Kelly in some wayobtained access to theconstruction of the Enochian system whilst they wereinCentral Europe. It is claimed that numerous Rosi-crucian centres existed inGermany, Austria, andBohemia, and both Dee and Kelly were received there-in.Whilst this may be a plausible theory, there is notthe least vestige ofobjective evidence for this assump-tion. Still others have believed that itrepresents arevival of certain species of Atlantean Magic, thoughthose who pressthis theory do not explain the Dee< 262 >diaries, nor his account of the method he and EdwardKelly employed to acquirethe roots of this system.Roughly, the facts which are concerned with theorigins of the system are these.Over one hundred largesquares filled with letters were obtained by Dee andKellyin a manner which we cannot quite determine.When working, Dee, for example,would have beforehim on a writing table one or more of these Tables,as a rule49\" x 49\", some full while others were letteredonly on alternate squares. ThenSir Edward Kellywould sit down at what they called the Holy Table onwhich werevarious magical pentacles, and which alsorested on wax seals. On this Table wasa large Crystalor Shewstone, in which, after a while, he reported tosee an Angelwho would point with a wand to letters oncertain charts in succession. Kellywould thereuponreport to Dee that the Angel pointed, for example, tocolumn 4,rank 29, of one of the many charts, and so011, apparently not mentioning theletter, which Deewould then find on the table before him, and write itdown. Whenthe Angel had finished his instruction, themessage—when it concerned certain ofthe major in-vocations or Calls—was rewritten backwards. It hadbeen dictated thewrong way round by the Angel sinceit was considered too dangerous to communicatein astraightforward manner, each word being so powerfula conjuration that itsdirect pronunciation or dictationwould have evoked powers and forces not desiredatthat moment.Regardless of their origin, these Tablets and thewhole Enochian system dorepresent realities of theinner planes. Their value is undoubted, as only alittlestudy and application prove. Whilst it may seem, atfirst sight, that theirgovernance is solely in the worldof the elementals, that is the Astrat plane,there is muchto indicate that they extend to planes which arespiritual anddivine in nature. In any event the magicalconception of the Elements is ratherdifferent from thatwhich obtains in most so-called occult philosophies.< 263 >Perhaps a word or two of caution might be added.Undoubtedly prudence is requiredin this matter. It Isa very powerful system, and if used carelessly andin-discriminately will bring about disaster and spiritualdisintegration. Thewarnings given in connection withthe Invocations are not to be regarded asconventionsor as platitudinous moralisings. They represent aknowledge of truefacts, and the student will do wellto take cognisance thereof. Let him study thetheoryfirst of all, so that he has a thorough knowledge of theconstruction ofthe squares and pyramids. This mustbe so ingrained within his mind, that aglance at the'l'ablets will automatically start an associative currentwhich willbring up without delay the attributions ofany given letter or square whichstrikes the eye. Onlywhen this has been accomplished, dare he venture totheactual use of the Pyramids with the God-forms, orto the employment of theInvocations in ceremonial.At this juncture, also, let me record one or two factsabout the Angelic languagein which the invocationsare couched. The Outer Order rituals state, whentheTablets are pointed out in the Temple to the Candidate,that they are written“in what our tradition calls theAngelic Secret Language.” The Tablets in use intheTemples, as well as those reproduced herein, are let-tered in English. These,however, are a translation or,more accurately, a transliteration of charactersbelong-ing to the Enochian Alphabet. These letters will befound reproduced on alater page. It is said that theseLetters are not simple in character, butpartake of thenature of Sigils. In the section on Talismans, it willhave beennoticed that certain Geomantic emblemsand Astrological symbols are referred tothese letters.This Angelic Secret language, whatever its origin, isa true language. It has,quite clearly, a syntax andgrammar of its own, and the invocations in thatlan-guage are not mere strings of words, but sentenceswhich can be translated,not simply transliterated intoEnglish. For instance, the Invocation of the three< 264 >Archangels ruling over the Spirit Tablet, employed inthe opening of the PortalGrade reads: “01 SonufVaorsagi Goho Iada Balata. Lexarph, Comanan,Tabitom.Zodakara, eka; zodakare od zodamran. Odokikte qaa, piape piaomoel od vaoan.”This, translated,means “I will reign over you, saith the God of Justice.Lexarph,Comanan, Tabitom, move, therefore. Showyourselves forth and appear. Declare untous the mys-teries of your creation, the balance of righteousnessand truth.”In a First Order side-lecture issued to newly-initiatedZelatores by G. H. FratreSub Spe, there is this noteon the Enochian system and language which mightbeworth reproducing:“One more point is shown you in this first part of thei = io Grade, and that isthe Great Terrestrial Watch-Tower or Tablet of the North. At present it willprob-ably be to all of you who are here present, with theexception of those whohave passed into the SecondOrder, an absolute sea of mystery. It appears acuriousarrangement of squares and letters in different colours,and perhaps youmay wonder to see English and notHebrew letters upon it, seeing that it is oneof the mostancient symbols in the world. I may tell you, withoutbetraying anyknowledge which is beyond you, thatthese letters are transliterated forconvenience. I donot think there is any one present, except myself, whocouldread the original language in which they arewritten. But I may tell you that itis a great curiositymerely from the linguistic point of view, becausethatlanguage and those characters in which it is written,are a perfect languagewhich can be translated, and yetthere is no record, so far as I am aware thatthat lan-guage was ever spoken, or those characters were everused by mortal man.Now that Muller and other greatphilologists have said that it is impossible thatanyhuman being should invent a language, here is a lan-guage which has existedfor as far back as we are ableto trace. We find traces of it on rock-cut pillarsand on< 265 >temples, apparently as old as the world. We find tracesof it in the sacred andsecret mysteries of some of theoldest religions in the world, but we find notrace of itever having been used as a living language, and wehold the traditionthat it is the Angelic secret language.Only one instance of this I may perhapsbe allowed togive. The high priest of Jupiter in the earliest days ofRome wascalled Flamen Dialis, and you will find thatthe most learned are utterlyignorant as to whencecame the word Dialis. They will tell you that it isancientEtruscan, but beyond that they can tell younothing. It is not the genitive ofany known nomina-tive. On that Tablet (Earth) you will see that thesecond of theThree Holy Secret Names of God is Dial*’Although no philologist, and without theleast scien-tific knowledge of comparative languages, yet I havefound the studyof this Angelical of Enochian languagean absorbing interest. Going through theinvocationswith the intention of compiling a dictionary of theextant words hasconvinced me personally that we havehere fragmentary pieces of a very ancienttongue—alanguage which is far older even than the Sanskrit. Itmust have been aliving tongue at one time, thoughmany thousands of years ago. and it maytherefore beclaimed for Enochian that the fragments we do haveare in the oldestlanguage of which we have any knowl-edge. In short, though as pure speculation,it is believedthat the language in which these invocations are writtenareremnants of the tongue of the age-old Atlanteans.True, there are no means forthe time being of provingthis speculation, or of bringing forward the leastcon-vincing item of corroboration other than that it is aninstinctive orintuitive conviction. In the quotationrendered above, Fratre Sub Spe does giveone exampleof an Enochian word appearing in antiquity, and this tosome may provesuggestive. If only we knew it. thereprobably are hordes of words similar to thecase quoted,and these may come to light when expert attention isgiven to thesubject.266 >Since writing the above, another instance of anEnochian word has come to myattention. ReadingCharles Johnson’s translation of, and Theosophicalcommentaryupon, the great Upanishads of India, Ifind reference to a certain character oflegend, UmaHaimavati. The Kcna Upanishad speaks of her as thedaughter of theSnowy Mountain, and she is, interpretsMr. Johnson, a symbol of the hidden Wisdompersoni-fied as the child of the Himalaya who reveals theEternal. And CharlesJohnson then proceeds, “Curi-ously, while the inner significance of the name ofthiswoman greatly radiant is lost in Sanskrit, it must havebeen clear in theolder tongue which lies behindSanskrit; for it remains in the group of youngerAryantongues called Slavonic. Here, the root Urn is the com-mon word forintelligence.”The italics marked in Johnson’s commentary aremine. This point must strongly beindicated, for thesignificance of that word Um is retained, not alone intheSlavonic as shown by Mr. Johnson, but also in theEnochian or Angelical language.For example, in theSecond Enochian Key, used to invoke the Angels ofthe SpiritTablet, and in the Sixteenth Key we find theword “OM”' translated by“Understand.” (Let me re-mark here too, that the translation of the words intheEnochian invocations came from the same occult orangelic source as theinvocations themselves, and werenot made by either Dee or Kelly.) Again, intheFifteenth Key, we find the English version of the Call“0 thou . . . whoknowest” as equivalent to “Ils . . . dsomax.” While in the Call of the ThirtyAethers, “Oma”is rendered as “understanding.” Thus there is everyindication tobelieve that if there was a language“which lies behind Sanskrit” as supposed byMr.Charles Johnson and of course by many others, whichaccording to thephilosophy of the Ancient Wisdom isthat of Atlantis, then the Enochian orAngelical lan-guage bears several strong points of resemblance to it.Yet, the puzzle is this. Prior to the previously de-< 267 >scribed ceremonial skrying of Dr. Dee and Sir EdwardKelly towards the close ofthe 16th century there isabsolutely no trace of any part of the Enochianmagicalsystem or Angelical language in Europe. There are in-numerable ancientand mediaeval records of so-called‘‘barbarous names of evocation/’ many of thembeingassembled apparently in sentences and runes, etc. Butnone of these latterhave the coherence which theEnochian language does have, nor do they betraytracesof grammar and syntax which arc clearly indicated inthe Angelical Keys. Insome incomprehensible manner,this pair of psychics must have stumbled on athreadwhich unfolded, perhaps from their own subconsciousmemory of former lives,parts of this strange tongueof a by-gone age. Stumbled, I use advisedly, for acloseperusal of their diaries both published and unpublishedreveals nothing toindicate that Dee or Kelly had any-thing but the remotest idea of what it wasthat theywere recording so carefully. The way they have re-corded theinvocations, as shown in Sloane mss 3191in the British Museum, indicates theyhad neverstudied its intricacies or grammar, and thus manywords became jumbledand joined together. Only alittle study of the Calls is necessary to revealtheirmistakes, and to restore what is clearly the originalarrangement of words.For instance, the word “L” or“EL” meaning “The first” or “One” is invariablyjoinedon to the succeeding word in the Dee version; there isno necessity forthis.It is clear that the Angelical language was not in thepossession of a possessivecase, and thus we find severalinstances of the English translation, where theposses-sive case is used, not tallying exactly with the Enoch-ian. We find“Lonshi Tox” translated by “His Power”when strictly it ought to be, if the wordsare literallyto be translated “The power of him.” And “Elzap Tilb”is rendered“Her course” instead of “The course of her.”I mention this simply to show thatthe language is areal one, and not a mere jumble of unmeaning words to< 268 >which an arbitrary translation was given. With thepublication of the invocationshere, I hope that seriousexperienced philologists will devote some attentiontothis matter so that we can thrash out once and for all,on the objective plane,the true nature of the languageand the vertical source of its origins.It is said in the © — GO Ritual that some of the onlyFratres of the Ordercompiled a dictionary of this lan-guage. At any rate, such is not in existencenow, thoughthe writer, using the Angelical Calls, has compiled adictionary ofthe extant Enochian words. Unfortunate-Jy, it is not possible to include thisdictionary with thepresent account of Order Teaching.Incidentally, for practical purposes, the language ispronounced by taking eachletter separately, whenevera lack of vowels renders it necessary. But, with alittlepractice, the pronunciation will come instinctivelywhen the student wantsit. “Z” is always pronounced“Zod” with a long “o.”My last word is an insistence upon the necessity fora thorough grasp of thepreliminary part. It should beread again and again, so that the studentactuallyabsorbs the material, rather than learns it by a feat ofmemory orconscious intellection. It may take somemonths this way, but once it has made ita part of hismode of thinking, so that it has been assimilated intothe verystructure of his brain, the real significance andmeaning of the system willbegin to dawn on him.I.

In addition to these four there is anothersmallerTablet, which is called The Tablet of Union, referred tothe element ofEther or Spirit. Its function, as its nameimplies, is to unite and bind togetherthe four elementalTablets. For purposes of study the four ElementalTablets orWatch-Towers are arranged as are the ele-ments in the Pentagram, although theorder is ratherdifferent:i.Water Tablet4-Fire TabletAir Tablet3*Earth TabletTo each Tablet are referred innumerable attributions,which will be dealt with inthe course of this paper, theprincipal elementary ones being those of colour.Certainsquares on each Tablet were painted in the colour ofthe Element,according to the King Scale, whilst otherswere left wholly or partly white. Thusin each Tabletthere are four principal types of square. There are thoseof:1. The Great Cross of 36 squares, lettered in blackon white, stretching throughthe entire Tablet.2. The Sephirotic Calvary Crosses, lettered also inblack on white, in the fourcorners on theTablets.3. The Kerubic Squares, which are always in theelemental colour of the Tablet,and are the foursquares immediately above each SephiroticCross.< 274 >4. The Servient Squares, always in the colour ofthe Tablet, and consist of the16 squares of eachlesser angle beneath each Sephirotic Cross.The Kerubic and Servient squares on each Tablet arecoloured in the elementalcolour, with the letters drawnthereon in the complementary colour, thus:AIR TABLET painted in Yellow. Lettering on Airquarter Mauve.WATER TABLET painted in Blue. Lettering onWater quarter Orange.EARTH'TABLET painted in Black. Lettering onEarth quarter Green.FIRE TABLET painted in Fire. Lettering on Firequarter Green.The lettering on the other three Angles follows theelement. Thus, to considerthe Fire Tablet as an ex-ample, the colouring of each Angle of the Tablet willbe:i.Lesser Angleof AIRYellow Letterson Red3-Lesser Angleof EARTHBlack Letterson Red2.Lesser Angleof WATERBlue Letterson Red4*Lesser Angle^ of FIREGreen Letterson RedThe TABLET OF UNION, which is attributed toSpirit, the fifth point of thePentagram, is a smallTablet of twenty squares, five letters wide, four deep.Itsletters are painted on a white ground:EXARP, attributed to Air, is painted in yellowletters, ist line.HCOMA, attributed to Water, is painted in blueletters. 2nd line.NANTA, attributed to Earth, is painted in blackletters. 3rd line.< 275 >BITOM, attributed to Fire, is painted in redletters. 4th line.Each of these twenty squares is attributed in part toSpirit, and its letters areused in combination withthose on the Elemental Tablets in the formationofcertain Names.The most important item on each Angelic Tablet isthe Great Cross whose shaftdescends from top tobottom and whose bar crosses the Tablet in the centre.ThisCross comprises 36 squares, and has a doublevertical line which is called LineaDei Pairis Filiique,the Line of God the Father and the Son, and LineaSpiritusSancti, the Line of the Holy Spirit, crossingthis horizontally, and containingone rank of letters.The Linea Spiritus Sancti is always the seventh line orrankof letters from the top, while the two verticalcolumns of the Linea Dei PatrisFiliique are always thesixth and seventh columns counting from either rightorleft.From this Great Cross, various Angelic and DivineNames are produced, which areof supreme importance.First of all there are the “Three Great Secret HolyNamesof God” which are found in the Linea SpiritusSancti. This line comprises twelveletters, w'hich aredivided into names of three, four, and five letters read-ingfrom left to right. Thus in the Air Tablet, you willfind ORO IBAH AOZPI; in theWater Tablet: MPHARSL GAIOL; in the Earth Tablet: MOR DIALHCTGA, and in the FireTablet: OIP TEAA PDOCE.These Three Secret Holy Names of God are themajor names of the Tablets. TheseNames are con-ceived to be borne as ensigns upon the Banners of theGreat King ofeach quarter. The Name of the GreatKing is always a name of eight letters andcomprisesa spiral or whirl in the centre of the Great Cross. Thusin the AirTablet, the Great King is BATAIVAH. Itis produced:< 276 >And so for the other three Angelic Tablets. The Kingis a very powerful force,and since it initiates the whirlit is to be invoked with due care.The next series of important names obtained fromthe Great Cross are the SixSeniors. Their names beginfrom the sixth and seventh squares of the LineaSpiritusSancti, including these squares, and read outwardsalong the three linesof the Cross to the edge of theTablet. Each is a name of seven letters. In thecase ofthe Air Tablet, the Six Seniors are:HABIOROFAtAAOXAIFiDHTMORDAARX0AHAOZPIOMAVTOTARATO R O f 3AHA 0 z,HIPOTGAVTOTArJ1POTGA(Note the overlapping of letters in the central squares).The Eight-lettered Nameof the King, and the six< 277 >Names of seven letters each of the Seniors,-are invokedby means of the Hexagram.They are attributed to theSun and Planets, and are on a different andhigherplane than are the elemental names. The attribution tothe points of theHexagram is:The King is attributed to the Sun, and the six SolarHexagrams invoke him. TheSenior formed on the lefthand of the Linea Spiritus Sanc'ti is attributed toMars;that on the right hand to Venus. The Name of theSenior formed by theletters in the upper half of theLinea Dei Patris (which is the left descendingcolumnof the Cross, as the right column is the Linea DeiFiliique) is attributedto Jupiter, and the lower halfto Mercury. The Senior formed by the letters ontheupper half of the Linea Dei Filiique is referred to Luna,whilst the Nameformed by the letters in the lowerhalf Is referred to Saturn.These rules apply to each of the Four Tablets andare constant and invariablethroughout. These threesets of Names—the Holy Names of God, the Name ofthe King,and the Names of the Six Seniors, are alltaken from the Great Central Cross.Their Names arealways painted in black letters on a white ground.We must now refer to the lesser Angles of eachTablet. The order given to thearrangement of theFour Tablets also applies to the structure of each indi-vidualTablet, for each is shown together with itsappropriate sub-elements. The GreatCross is themechanism which divides the Tablet and separates(and binds together)the four sub-elements or LesserAngles, as they are called, from the other.In the centre of each Lesser Angle will be seen aCross of Ten squares. This iscalled the SephiroticCalvary Cross. From the letters arranged on this Crossaretaken two divine names which call forth and controlthe angels and spirits of theLesser Angle, and theirnames are used in a preliminary invocation when work-ingmagically with a square of a lesser angle. From thevertical line of theSephirotic Cross, reading from above< 278 >downwards, comes a Deity Name of six letters. Thus, inthe Air Lesser Angle ofthe Air Tablet, we find, in thewhite descending line of the Cross, the nameIDOIGO.It is with this name that the Angels and Spirits of theLesser Angle areto be called. From the cross-bar, read-ing from left to right, comes the deityname of fiveletters, ARDZA, which is used to command thoseAngels called by thefirst name. Thus in every Sephi-rotic Cross in every Lesser Angle, we obtain twodivinenames. One on the descending shaft, always of sixletters, and one on thecross-bar, reading from left toright, of five letters. These names must be readin theseprescribed directions, for if they are reversed, thev callforth evilforces. Like the Names from the Great Cross,these Names on the Sephirotic Crossare painted inblack letters on white. Rut unlike the former, theselatter areemployed with the Pentagram.We now come to the coloured squares grouped aboveand below the Sephirotic Crossin each of the LesserAngles. The most important of these are the four abovethecross-bar of the Sephirotic Cross—called the Keru-bic Squares. From these foursquares are derived fournames of four letters each. Thus, for the top rank oftheAiry Angle of the Air Tablet, we have:R Z (I) L ANote that the white square in the centre, belongs tothe Sephirotic Cross and isnot included in the namesderived from the Kerubic Squares. From thesefourletters we obtain four names, thus: RZLA. ZLAR.LARZ. ARZL.These Four Names, the Names of the Four KerubicAngels of the Lesser Angle, rulethe servient squaresbelow the Sephirotic Cross, and of the four, the firstis themost powerful as the others are derived there-from. By prefixing to these fournames a letter from theappropriate line of the Tablet of Union, we obtainevenmore powerful names, archangelic in character. Thusfor the Kerubic Rank ofthe Air Lesser Angle of the< 279 >Air Tablet, which we are using as our example, theletter “E” of the word “EXARP”on the Tablet ofUnion is prefixed. This produces ERZLA. EZLAR.ELARZ. EARZL,The rule is that thefirst letter of the appropriateline of the Tablet of Unionis prefixed only to theNames formed from the Kerubic Squares. In the AiryAngleof the Water Tablet, the principle Kerubic Nameis TAAD. The name formed by theaddiiton of theappropriate letter from the Tablet of Union isHTAAD: and so on.As an example of this methodapplied to the remaining servient squares of theAirAngle of the Air Tablet, we find:X is added to the 16 servient squares of the angleof AIR.A is added to the 16 servient squares of the angleof WATER.R is added to the 16 servient squares of the angleof EARTH.P is added to the 16 servient squares of the angleof FIRE.Hence EXARP will be used entirely on the AirTablet, and is never used on theother three Tablets.The First letter applies to the Kerubic Squares of eachofthe four Lesser Angles, whilst the remaining fourletters apply to the sixteenservient squares of thoseAngles as shown above. The other names of the TabletofUnion are attribuetd similarly to Water, Earth, andFire. As an example, I givebelow Names formed fromthe Lesser Angle of Fire in the Water Tablet:NL1RXATAPAXPAcNVAASADA3pIR.ND1HNLRXHLRXNHRXNLHXNLR.AXPCNAPCNXACNXPANXPC.AVASAAASAVASAVAAAVAS.ADAPIAAPIDA PI DAAIDAP.ARNILANILRAILRNALRNI.< 280 >Picture #48 [images/img_0048.bmp]The ritual for the consecration of the Four Element-al Weapons gives excellentexamples of the spirit orarchangelic names formed from the Kerubic Squaresby theaddition of letters from the Tablet of Union.The attribution of the Name Yod He Vau He.This Name is the key to the whole of the Enochianattributions of the squares tothe Elements: The lettersare thus referred:' YOD FIRE WANDSn HE WATER CUPSl VAU AIR SWORDSn (final) HE EARTH PENTACLESThe letters of the great name attributed to the FourTablets in order together:Picture #49 [images/img_0049.bmp]ftEarth lab letfire 1abet< 281 >The letters of the great name attributed to eachcorner of the separate Tablets:Air Lesser Anqta Water lesser Anqle«PiPicture #50 [images/img_0050.bmp]Earth Lesser Ancjla Eire Lesser Angle.Not only are the Letters of Tetragrammaton attrib-uted to the Tabletsthemselves, and to the LesserAngles of the Tablets, but they are so arrangedthateven the Squares of the Tablets come under the juris-diction and governanceof the letters. So far as concernsthe Great Cross, the method for attributing toit theletters of the Name is to divide each vertical andhorizontal line intogroups of three adjoining squares.Against the top left hand corner of the GreatCross,and on the left of its horizontal shaft, put the letterof the Name for theElement of the Tablet, thus VAUfor the Air Tablet, Yod for the Fire Tablet, etc.< 282 >Picture #51 [images/img_0051.bmp]1V*nn!VTT“sft!HsV\\nPicture #52 [images/img_0052.bmp]FlnI_v'nr1n%Eacn square of the above diagram represents threesquares on the Tablets. Thisattribution is perfectlysimple if it be remembered that the letter consonanttothe Tablet always comes to the top and left.The arrows show the direction in which the Nameis to be read.The Sephirotic Crosses in the Lesser Angles have,as the student will alreadyhave noted, ten Squares,each of which is referred to one of the Sephiroth oftheTree of Life. The Sephirotic Cross therefore representsthe Sephiroth modifiedby the letter of the lesser angle.Thus Kether in the Airy Lesser Angle is theKether ofVau. In the Watery Lesser Angle, it is the Kether ofHeh, and so on. Theletters, in this case, as elsewhereexplained, refer to the four Worlds.Referring to the other squares of the lesser angles,in the Kerubic Rank theoutside square is alwaysattributed to the letter corresponding to the Elementofthe Lesser Angle. In the Tablets of Air and Water,the Name reads right to leftin the two upper quarters;in the two lower quarters it reads from left toright.In the Tablets of Earth and Fire, left to right in the< 283 >upper, but in the two lower quarters form right to left.Thus in the FourTablets, the Name reads:Picture #53 [images/img_0053.bmp]Though the last two groups of the name are the same,this does not indicate thatthe squares are identical.Their elemental composition differs enormously ineachlesser angle, as a little later will be seen.The Servient Squares beneath the Calvary Cross maybe considered as of fourvertical columns of four squareseach, or, looking at it from a different angle,of fourhorizontal ranks also of four squares each. In attribut-ing the lettersof Tetragrammaton to these ServientSquares, the rule is that they follow theattributionsof the Kerubic Squares. The columns (that is readingfrom abovedownwards) follow the order of the KerubicSquares above, and this order isinvariably followeddownwards for the ranks, reading from right to left.Thus inthe Air Lesser Angle of the Air Tablet, theKerubic Rank has attribution to theName:VAU HEH YOD HEH (Final)Therefore applying the above rule, the Servientsquaresbeneath the Sephirotic Cross follow:VAU HEH YOD HEH (Final)(Final) IIEH * * #YOD * * # *HEH * * * *VAU * * *From this example, it will be clearly indicated thateach square has a doubleattribution to the letters ofTetragrammaton, none being the same since acolumnand a rank differ. Thus, Column VAU rank Yod does< 284 >not coincide in nature with Column YOD rank VAU.We must now approach the reason for this complexseries of references of theletters of the Tetragramma-ton to the squares. According to these attributions,soare certain Astrological, Tarot, Geomantic and Hebrewsymbols referred to theSquares.It will be remembered that in attributing the lettersof the Name to the GreatCross, we subdivided thelatter into groups or blocks of three squares each.Everyblock was attributed to some one letter of Tetra-grammaton. Now the Signs of theZodiac are to beattributed to the Great Cross, and each of those twelveSigns isto be referred to three squares constituting onegroup or block. The order oftheir attribution is gov-erned by the letters of the Great Name alreadyreferredto the arms of the Great Cross. For instance, FierySigns (Aries, Leo,and Saggitarius) are attributed toYOD. Watery Signs (Cancer, Scorpio, andPisces) areattributed to HEH. Airy Signs (Gemini, Libra,Aquarius) are attributedto VAU. Earthy Signs(Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn) are attributed to HEHfinal.Thus each group of three squares, constituting asingle unit, is attributed toone sign of the Zodiac,depending upon the letter of the Name referred tothatgroup. Each Zodiacal Sign, being divisible into threeDecanates, or divisionsof ten degrees, it follows thateach of three Decanates of the Sign may bereferred toone of the squares in any group of three squares. TheSign refers tothe group, the Decan refers to one squareof that group.The rule governing the attributions of the TwelveSigns to the Great Cross is:the Four Kerubic or FixedSigns (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius) arere-ferred to the squares of the Linea Spiritus Sancti. TheFour Cardinal Signs(Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn)are referred to the left side of the Linea DeiPatrisFiliique, and the Four Mutable Signs (Gemini, Virgo,< 285 >Sagittarius and Pisces) to the right side of the LineaDei Patris Filiique.The decanate system as employed by the Order willbe found in the part of thisbook dealing with thesignificance of the Tarot Cards. They begin withtheattribution of the first decanate of Aries to the planetMars, and ending withthe last decanate of Pisces alsoruled by Mars. The order of planets for thedecanatesfollows the order of Sephiroth on the Tree of Life:Saturn, Jupiter,Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, and Luna.There are 36 small cards of the Tarot, as explainedin the appropriate documents,attributed to thedecanates of the Twelve Signs. Therefore to each of thedecanatesquares on the Great Cross will be attributedone of the small cards of theTarot. 2, 3, and 4, of eachof the four Suits of Tarot are referred toCardinalSigns. 5, 6, 7 to the Kerubic or Fixed Signs; and 8, 9,and 10 to theMutable Signs. Thus in the Air Tablet,the Great Cross shows the Tarot anddecanate attribu-tions thus:< 286 >Linao DeiUnaaSpirits*T)arvc t u &Picture #54 [images/img_0054.bmp]The attribution of the Sephiroth to the ten squaresof the Sephirotic Cross isshown on the AdmissionBadge to the 27th Path of Peh, and reproduced in oneof theKnowledge Lectures. The planetary attributionsto the Sephirotic Cross as used inthe Enochian systemare rather different from those used on the Tree of Life.Butthe system that is here employed is constant, andapplies to each of the sixteenSephirotic Crosses onthe four Tablets.In this mode of attributing the planets to theSephiroth on the Calvary Cross ofthe Lesser Angles,Saturn is excluded, and Jupiter and the Tarot Trump,the Wheelof Fortune is attributed to Kether. The titleof this card is “The Lord of theForces of Life,” andKether is the origin and source of Life.To Chokmah is attributed Mercury, the Tarot Key,The Magician, “The Magus ofPower” seeing that< 287 >Chokmah is the distributor of the power from Kether,even as Mercury is themessenger of Jupiter of Classicalmythology.To Binah is referred the Moon, and the Tarot Key,“The Priestess of the SilverStar,” even as Binah isthe completer of the Triad of the Supernals, and asitwere High Priestess to the Inferior Sephiroth. (Com-pare also, says S.R.M.D.,the position of the Path ofGimel in the Tree of Life.)To Chesed, Venus, and the Key of The Empress,“The Daughter of the Mighty Ones.”Chesed is, as itwere, the first of the Inferiors below Binah, and thePath ofVenus is thus reciprocal between Chokmah andBinah, forming, as it were, the baseof the Triangle ofthe Supernals.To Geburah, Mars, and the Tarot Key, The BlastedTower, “The Lord of the Hosts ofthe Mighty,” evenas Geburah represents strength and fiery power.To Tiphareth is the Sun, “The Lord of the Fire ofthe World,” even as Tipharethis, as it were the heartand centre of the Sun of Life.The remaining four squares of the Sephirotic Crosshave no planetary orastrological attributions. The tensquares of the Sephirotic Cross also stand forthe Aceand small cards of the Suit represented by the Elementof the LesserAngle. Thus Wands are attributed to theFire Angle, Pentacles to the Earth Angle,etc.The Kerubic Squares are allotted, as their nameimplies, to the four Kerubimwhose emblems follow theorder of the letters of Tetragrammaton:YODLion—LeoKingVAUMan—-AquariusPrinceHEHEagle—ScorpioQueenHEH (final)Bull—TaurusPrincessThese last are of the suit corresponding to the Element< 288 >of the Lesser Angle as explained above, viz: Wands toFire and Yod; Cups to Waterand Heh; Swords to Airand Vau; Pentacles to Earth and Heh final.It was previously shown how the squares of theServient part of each lesser anglewere given a doubleattribution to the letters of the Name. They were seento beruled by a letter governing the rank, and also bya letter governing the column.In order to work outthe' astrological attributions of this allocation, notethatthe columns go by the triplieity of the Kerubic Squareat the top, the ranksby quality. By this method thereresults a highly intricate and ingenioussubdivision ofelements in the sub-elements of the Lesser Angles.YOD and Fire are referred to the Cardinal Signs,25 VS.HEH and Water are referred to the Kerubic orFixed Signs, % ttlVAU and Air are referred to the Mutable Signs,X W * X-HEH final and Earth are referred to the Elements,A V A T?-As to the reasons of this latter attribution, S.R.M.D.says that the FourCardinal Signs are called the mostfiery because most solar in nature. That is,the Equi-noxes and Solstices occur when the Sun is in thesesigns. The Kerubic orFixed Signs are consideredwatery because they are the most shining andglitteringin nature. The remaining four Mutable signs are calledthe most Airybecause they are the most subtle innature. While the four elements are the mostEarthybecause their operation is mainly terrestrial. Inciden-tally, instead ofthe usual Earth symbol, the planetSaturn is used in the Enochian system,because, toquote S.R.M.D. “though one of the seven Lords whowander (planets),Saturn is yet here classed with thosewho abide because he is the heaviest of theseven and< 289 >thus formeth a link between the Wanderers andAbiders.”The following diagram shows how any Lesser Anglemay be worked out using theabove rules:itHwTvTTTTTw&-[)cT09$mS.'.i \\.*V'm1|M1pis8miv1rh'r-.v;mst§9itWEES—u aIt10m01 tjpiShaded areasare SlueEARTH ANGLE OF WATER TABLETOne final set of attributions concerns the Tablet ofUnion, which is referred toSpirit. It is employed, asbefore shown, in binding together the Tablets, andinbuilding up Angelic Names. Its attributions are to theFour Aces of theElements and to the Court Cards. TheAces represent the root force, and theessential spiritualnoumenon of the element.

It is imperative to understand thoroughlythebasic principles of attributions before beginning theanalysis of the Pyramidsbased on each square. Whatfollowc will have little meaning if the reader hasnotworked out these references and attributions for him-self.T he following diagram shows the Letters of Tetra-grammaton attributed to theFour Enochian Tabletsin detail. The figures refer to the order of readingtheHebrew letters, but must under no circumstances beconfused with the order ofthe Angelic names on theTablets, which always read from left to right.In the 4=7 Grade the admission badge for the 28thPath was a Pyramid. It wasdescribed as having asquare base, and four sides composed ofequilateraltriangles cut off so as to leave a fiat top. These foursides wereattributed to the four Elements, and theflat top was conceived to be the throneof Eth, theSpirit. Hitherto, the Squares of the Enochian Tabletshave beentreated as a single whole, and as being flat.In reality, however, they arerepresented as beingpyramids like that described above. The practicalmagicalsignificance of this will be shown hereafter, butfor the moment we must considerthe method of pro-ducing the sides of these Pyramids, and their attribu-tions.With the exception of the Tetragrammatonletter, upon which everything elsedepends, all the otherattributions appear and are included in the definitionofthe nature of the Pyramid. Each side of the Pyramidis coloured according to itsown appropriate element,or left white for Spirit. It by no means followsforexample that a square front the Airy Angle of Air willbuild up a completelyyellow pyramid. But everysquare of the Air Tablet, in every angle, has atleastone Airy yellow side to its pyramid. Every square of< 291 >KF.Y OF ATTRIBUTIONSPicture #55 [images/img_0055.bmp]Picture #56 [images/img_0056.bmp]ATTRIBUTIONOF THEGREAT NAME TOTHE FOUR LESSER ANGLESPicture #57 [images/img_0057.bmp]< 292 >the Airy Angle of all four Tablets has at least oneAiry side.On a flat surface, the Pyramid is represented bydividing the Square into fourtriangles, leaving a smallsquare in the centre to mark the flat top. On this,ifdesired, the appropriate Enochian letter may be placed.The following will bethe standard of reference, so thatlater should mention be made of Triangle No.2, thefollowing diagram will show its position.Picture #58 [images/img_0058.bmp]The Pyramid is supposed to be in position on theTablet, so that Triangle No. 2points to the top of theTablet. To work out the pyramid of any squarecom-pletely, it is necessary to know the attributions of theFour Triangles andthe element of each. Since everyTablet comprises four distinct divisions, eachof thesemust be considered separately as each produces a dif-ferent type ofpyramid. The rules for analysing thepyramid based on the squares will beconcisely putthus:Great Cross.Triangle No. 1. Sign of Zodiac, small card of Tarot.Triangle No. 2. Spirit.Triangle No, 3. Planet of Decan.Triangle No. 4. Elemental Symbol of the Tablet.Note that Triangle No. 2 on the squares of the GreatCross is always Spirit, asindicating the operation ofthe Spirit in the primary Element, and is shownwhite.Triangle No. 4 is coloured according to the element ofthe Tablet; thus Redfor Fire Tablet, Blue for Water,<293 >Black for Earth, Yellow for Air. Triangle No. i is tobe coloured according tothe triplicity of the Signattributed to it, that is as to whether it is of anEarthy,Eiery, Watery, or Airy nature. Triangle No. 3 is to becoloured in that ofthe Element ruled by the Planetattributed to it. The rule governing the latteris:Sun and Jupiter rule the element of Fire,Saturn and Mercury rule the element of Air,Venus and Moon rule the element ofEarth.Mars rules the element of Water.On the other hand there are alternative methods, theuse of which calls intooperation other forces than ele-mental. Thus the colour of No. 1 may be in thecolourof the Sign itself, as Red for Aries, and Blue forSagittarius, etc.Triangle No. 3 may also be colouredin the colour of the Planet itself, Orangefor the Sun,Green for Venus, etc. If these latter are used, planetaryandzodiacal forces would be inferred in lieu of purelyelemental ones. The former,however, may be found tobe the most practicable for most circumstances.The method of applying these rules to the GreatCross may be seen in thefollowing, consisting of thethree left band squares of the Linea Spiritus Sanctiofthe Air Tablet, showing the pyramids formed from thesquares of the lettersORO:Picture #59 [images/img_0059.bmp]Sephirotic Cross.Triangle No. 1.

It has not been men-tioned before, but it is the rule, when drawing orpaint-ing these pyramids and triangles, to paint the symbolson the appropriatesides in complementary colours.Thus, to take Triangle No. 1 of a servient squareinthe Water Angle of Water, the colour will be Blue torefer to the element ofthe Tablet as a whole, while theappropriate astrological attribution will bepainted onit in Orange. This rule applies to all the squares.< 295 >The method sounds highly complex, but in practiceit is much easier than itsounds.

For example, inBeth, the vowel following‘B’ is V pronounced AY. Therefore, if ‘B’ in anAn-gelical Name precede another as in ‘Sobha,’ thoumayest pronounce it‘Sobeh-hah/ ‘G’ may be eitherGimel or Jimel (as the Arabs do call it)followingwhether it be hard or soft.

M is pronounced Em; Nis pronounced En (alsoNu, since in Hebrew the vowel following theequivalentletter Nun is ‘u’); A is Ah; P is Peh; S is Ess; D is Deh.“NRFM is pronounced En-Ra-Ef-Em or En-Ar-Ef-Em.

It is to be noted that the numberofsquares in the vertical line of the Great Cross, that isin the Linea DeiPatris Filiique, will be 26, whichanswers to the Gem atria or number of YHVH.Alsothe number of points in the Geomantic symbols re-ferred to the Kerubim,Fortuna Major to Leo, Rubeusto Scorpio, Tristitia to Aquarius, and AmissiotoTaurus, are also 26 in number. The Ten squares re-maining on the horizontalbar of the Great Cross, thatis five on each side of the descending column, andnotconsidering the two squares on the centre where theshafts cross, will referto the Ten Sephiroth. And thefirst three letters of those squares willsymbolisethe triad of the Supernals operating through theQuadrangle.Looking at the horizontal line again, and consideringits full quota of twelvesquares, instead of as ten asbefore, then since they are divided into a 3, a 4,and a5,—as in OIP TEAA PDOCE—they may be said tosymbolise the Triad of theSupernals, the Tetrad of theElements, and the Pentagram. Again, in thecommenc-ing Triad of the Linea Spiritus Sancti of each Tablet,it may be saidthat:ORO will be symbolical of the Voice of the Man Kerub.MPH will be symbolical ofthe Cry of the Eagle Kerub.MOR will be symbolical of the Low of the BullKerub.OIP will be symbolical of the Roar of the Lion Kerub.There are various ways of looking at the Pyramidsprior to undertaking thepractical work of using themas the symbol for skrying in the spirit-vision.S.R.M.D.suggests a useful mode of meditation which elaboratesin a mostilluminating way the ordinary attributions.He says: “Thou mayest regard theupper triangle(No. 2) as representing a Force acting downwards.< 300 >The lower triangle (No. 4) as a force striving upwards.The left hand Triangle(No. 1) as acting horizontallyfrom left to right, and the right hand Triangle(No. 3)as a force acting from right to left. While the centre willbe the commonforce. Thus:Picture #61 [images/img_0061.bmp]\"Spirit is strong in any position. Remember that Fireacteth most stronglyupwards, Air downwards, Waterfrom right to left horizontally, and Earth fromleft toright. And in those Tablet Squares according to theirpositions in theGreat Tablet. And thus canst thouapply thy reason unto the elucidation of theeffect ofthe four forces thus rushing together.”Though this may sound wholly incomprehensible atfirst, a little reflection onthe nature of the movementof these forces yields a wealth of idea. S.R.M.D.pro-vides a few examples at hazard of this analysis, and Iquote them as follows:\"The Square ‘A’ of Exarp in the Tablet of Union.Triangle No. 1. Queen of Swords.Triangle No. 2. Spirit.< 301 >Triangle No, 3. Air.Triangle No. 4. Spirit.“Nearly all the squares of this Tablet represent somecombined effect of Lightand Life. Here Spirit acts bothdownwards and upwards. Air is not very stronginaction when it is here placed; and the Queen of Swordsrepresents the moistforce of Air, If eh of Vau. There-fore, if one could attribute a direct materialaction untothe Squares of the Tablet of Union, the terrestrial effectwould bethat of a moist and gentle, scarcely moving,breeze; with a soft vibrating Lightplaying through it,like the most gentle sheet-lightning in summer.”It will aid the reader considerably if, when meditat-ing upon these examples, hedraws the Pyramid withthe triangles so that he can refer to it at amoment’snotice.“The Square ‘H’ of ‘MPH’ in the Great Cross of theWater Tablet.Triangle No. 1, Seven of Cups, ttlTriangle No. 2.

H. Fratre S.R.M.D. Some of them areveryprofound and the student will do well if he givesthem a good deal ofattention—especially in connec-tion with the idea of the projection of the Treeof Lifeinto a solid sphere and forming Five Pillars. This< 303 >part of the Enochian teaching is taken from a manu-script entitled “X. The Bookof the Concourse of theForces. Binding together the Powers of the Squares intheTerrestrial Quadrangles of Enoch,”“Each of these Terrestrial Tablets of the Elements isdivided into 4 LesserAngles by the Great Central Crosswhich cometh forth as from the Gate of theWatchTower of the Element itself. The Horizontal Line ofeach of these ThreeGreat Crosses is named “LineaSpiritus Sancti.” The Perpendicular is calledLineaDei,” the Line of God the Father and Son, the “PatrisFiliique,”Macroprosopus and Microprosopus com-bined. For these 4 Vertical lines resemble 4mightyPillars each divided into twain by a light line shewingthis forth; TheFather Himself, in the absence of theline. And in its presence shewing the Son.“As aforesaid the central points of these 4 GreatCrosses do shew in theCelestial Heavens, and do cor-respond unto the 4 Tiphereth points referred to intheBook of the Astronomic view of the Tarot. Naturallythen the Linea SpiritusSancti coincides with theZodiacal Beit wherein is the Path of the Sun who istheadministrant of The Spirit of Life, and “The Lord ofthe Fire of the World.”The Four Linea S. S. then formthe complete circle of the Ecliptic, a circle atthe centreof the Zodiacal circle.“It is demonstrated in the Tarot manuscripts thatwhen the 10 Sephiroth in theirgrouping which iscalled the Tree of Life are projected in a Sphere(Kethercoinciding with the North Pole, Malkuth co-inciding with the South Pole, thePillar of Mildnesswith the Axis) then the Pillars of Severity and of Mercyarequadrupled, i.e. there are five Pillars instead ofthree Pillars.“The same scheme is therefore applicable to theCelestial Heavens, and the modeof the governance ofthese Tablets in the Heavens is also set forth in theTarotmanuscripts. But as before and as there is said,< 3°4 >the rule of these Four Tablets, Terrestrial as well asin the Heavens, is in theSpaces between the 4 Pillars.That is, between the double Pillars of SeverityandMercy. In these vast spaces at the ends of theUniverse are these Tabletsplaced as Watch-Towers,and therein is their dominion limited on either sidebythe Sephirotic Pillars, and having the great centra!cross of each Tabletcoinciding with one of the 4Tiphareth points in the Celestial Heavens.Thereforeeven in the small squares into which each Tablet isdivided, eachrepresents a vast area of dominion, havingthe correlation thereof in theUniverse, in the Planets,in our Earth, in the Fixed Stars, and even in Man,inanimals, vegetables, and minerals.“Therefore do the 4 Perpendicular or Vertical Lines ofthe 4 Crosses represent 4Great Currents of Forcepassing between North above and South below,inter-secting the Tiphareth points and thus affirming theexistence of the HiddenCentral Pillar of the Tree ofLife forming the Axis of the Sphere of theCelestialHeavens.“Therefore are these Lines which are vertical called‘Linea Dei Patris Filiique,’as manifesting that CentralColumn wherein are Kether and Tiphareth,Macro-prosopus and Microprosopus.“The Calvary Cross of 10 Squares which are in eachof the 4 Lesser Angles of eachTablet are attributedunto the action of the Spirit through the 10Sephirothherein. This Cross of 10 Squares is the admission badgeof the 27th Pathleading unto the Grade of Philosophus,the only Grade of the First Order in whichall theTablets are shewn. It represents the Sephiroth in bal-anced disposition,before which the Formless and Voidroll back. It is the form of the opened outdouble cubeand altar of incense. Therefore it is placed to rule eachof theLesser Angles of each Tablet.“A knowledge of these tablets will then, if complete,afford an understanding ofthe Laws which govern the< 3°5 >whole creation. The dominion of the Tablet of Unionis above that of the 4Terrestrial Tablets and towardsthe North of the Universe.“Of the letters on the Tablets, some be written ascapitals. These arc theinitial letters of certain Angels’names drawn forth by another method, not nowex-plained, and the offices of these do not concern aZ.A.M. Some squares havemore than one letter. Inthese cases, either letter characterises the Square.Thehigher one is preferable. The lower is weaker. If twoletters are side byside, the presumption is in favourof equality. Where two letters are in onesquare, thebest plan is to employ both. But one alone may beused with effect.“Of the difference between these Mystical Names ofthe Angels of the Tablets andthe Hebrew Names suchas Kerub, Auriel, and Michael, etc. Those HebrewAngel Nameswhich have been taught unto the FirstOrder are rather general than particular,attendingespecially to an office or rule whereunto such an Angelis allotted. Asit is written: ‘One Angel doth not under-take two messages.’ For these mightyAngels do rathershew forth their power in the governance of the 4GreatSephirotic Columns as aforesaid, viz: the doublecolumns of Severity and Mercywhen projected in asphere, and this also is under the Presidency oftheSephiroth. But the Names of the Angels of theEnochian Tablets do ratherexpress particular adapta-tions of Forces shewing forth all variations anddiversecombinations of those which are in the other case mani-fested in a moregeneral way.”It will be found written in the Clavicula TabularumEnochi: “Now we are tounderstand that there are FourAngel-Overseers . . . Each one of these Angels isamighty Prince, a Mighty Angel of the Lord and theyare of Him. They are as chiefWatchmen and Over-seers, set over several and respective parts of theWorld, viz:East, West, North, South, as under the< 3°6 >Almighty, their Governor, Protector, Defender. Andthe seals and authority ofwhom are confirmed in thebeginning of the World. To whom belong FourChar-acters, being tokens of the Son of God, by whom allthings are made in thecreation, and are the naturalmarks of his Holiness.”Now thou shalt observe that in the Book of theConcourse of the Forces, a sign isannexed unto eachof the Four Tablets of the Elements. That is, unto theTablet ofAir, a symbol of a T having four Yodsabove it.Picture #62 [images/img_0062.bmp]Picture #63 [images/img_0063.bmp]THE SIGILS OF THE ANGELIC TABLETSUnto the Tablet of Water a Cross Potent, havingtwo letters b. b. a figure 4 anda figure 6 in the anglesthereof.Unto the Tablet of Earth, a simple Cross potentwithout additions.Unto the Fire Tablet there is a circle having twelve< 307 >rays. These be the sacred seals or characters alludedto in the precedingquotation. Thou shalt know thatthese four seals be taken from the Sigillum Dei/Emeth,after and according unto a certain guidance of letterswhich is there setforth. This “Liber Aimeth siveSigillum Dei” that is the Book of Truth, or theSeal ofGod, entereth not into the knowledge of a ZelatorAdeptus Minor.From these Four Sigils there are Four names drawn4forth. From the Tau with Four Yods or T of theSigillum Ameth, T and 4 otherletters are obtained,4counting by the rule of 4 (from the T which is foundat the top of the circle ofletters and numbers on theSigillum Dei Ameth), thus:4.22. 20.18, 1. og.T h a 08This yields the name Tahaoelog for the Air Tablet.(The Fourth square each time from the last willshow the letter and figure given.You are not to count,say, 22 or 20 or 18, but 4 only.—N.O.M.)From b.4. 6.b, grouped about a cross, note that Tequals t, the Cross equals th),is obtained: Cross to h,then b.4., then 6.b,, and continue by 6:4. 22. b. y. 6. 6. a. t. n. n.Th h 4 14 b A 5 9 14yielding the name Thahebyobeaatanun for the WaterTablet.(Four moves from T gives 22.h. b.4, is specially put.y.14 moves to 22 from t.Then 6.b. is special.

A. 9.which yields Ohooohaatan for the Fire Tablet.(Count twelve in every case, neglecting the numbersover or under, alwaysforward.—S.A.)These Names are not to be lightly pronounced.(Note: Some remark obviously is required for theabove. First, the Sigillum DeiAmeth is part of the verycomplex system worked out by Dee and Kelly. Nomentionof it is made in any of the official Order teach-ing for the grade of Z.A.M.other than the above. Ihave, through meditative and British Museum re-search,obtained a good deal of information about thisSigillum and associated“Enochiana,” but have decidedto withhold publication for the time being sincethisvolume is intended to reproduce veridical Order teach-ing and not the resultof personal research. The Namesyielded by the analysis of the Sigils are to beconsideredas the Elemental Kings of the entire Tablet. Thereshould be noconfusion between the nature and func-tion of the King whose name is derivedfrom the whorlin the centre of the Great Cross, and the elementalKing whose nameis implicit in the sigil. The King ofthe Quarter bearing the Banners of theNames of Godis planetary in nature, representing rather the operationof thedivine spirit through the Element and its foursub-elements. Whereas, the Kingwhose name is de-rived from the Sigil is a powerful elemental force.Hisoperation is essentially elemental, and his nature iselemental, and he doesnot represent in any way theoperation of the Spirit. That is not to say that heis anevil force. On the contrary; but it is purely and in-trinsically anelemental force and as such should behandled by invocation with great care. — I.R.)< 309 >PART TWOTHE CONCOURSEOFTHE FORCESThe Keys of the Governance and Combinations ofthe Squares of the Tablets. Theyare the Sphynx andthe Pyramid of Egypt; that is, the combination of theKerubsbeing the Sphynx. The combination of theElements being the Pyramid.Now learn a mystery of the Wisdom of Egypt:“When the Sphynx and the Pyramid areunited, thouhast the formulae of the Magic of Nature.”“These are the keys of the wisdom of all Time; andits beginning—who knoweth it?In their keeping arethe sacred mysteries and the knowledge of Magic andall theGods.”In the Ritual of the 32nd Path leading unto theTheoricus Grade, it is thuswritten: “The Sphynx ofEgypt spake and said: I am the synthesis of theEle-mental Forces. I am also the symbol of Man. I am Life.I am Death. I am theChild of the Night of Time.”The solid Pyramid of the Elements again is theAdmission Badge of the 28th Pathleading to thePhilosophus Grade. It is attributed to the Four Ele-ments.Therefore on its base is the word Olahm, mean-ing World, and upon its sides arethe names of theElements: Aesh, Ruach, Mayim, Aretz or Ophir. Yetthe Apex is notallowed to remain vacant, nor quiteacute in shape, but is cut off and so a smallsquare isformed at the Apex, and the Letters Eth, meaningEssence are placedtherein.This small square maketh of the pyramid a certainThrone or shrine. On thisthrone a certain ruling forceis seated. Within the Throne is a sacred symbol.Place< 310 >then within each Pyramid its appropriate sphynx, andthe image of its God above.Take thou each Pyramidas the key of the nature of each Tablet Square. TheSphynxof each will vary in form according to the pro-portion of the elementscomprising the Square. TheGod of Egypt, whose image is to be placed aboveeachPyramid, shall represent the force ruling under the di-rection of the GreatAngel of the Square. (That is,under the Name formed by the addition of aletterfrom the Tablet of Union.—I.R.). This God shall bethe symbol of the powerof the Light acting therein, asthe Angel shall be the descent of that Lightitself. TheAngelic Name may be typified by the correspondencesof the fourLetters of the Angel’s name, adding AL tothe Name—the letters of the Namestanding for head,bust, arms, body, and lower limbs, etc., as taught intheinstruction on Telesmatic Images. Place the name inTheban or Enochian letterson the girdle.The four forms of the Sphynx are:The Bull WinglessThe Eagle or Hawk .WingedAngel or Man WingedLion WinglessThis variation as to wings is another reason why, ingrouping the Tablets and thelesser angles of the same,the two forms of Air and Water are placed above thetwoTablets of Earth and Fire.From the pyramid of the square, the symbolic formof each Sphynx is formed thus:The upmost of the fourTriangles (Triangle No. 2.) sheweth the head andneck, andin the case of the Angel or Eagle, it showswhether wings are to be added to theform of theSphynx. The two triangles right and left (TrianglesNo. i and 3) showthe body w’ith the arms or Fore-limbs here also. If Angel or Eagle there areWingsadded unto the representation of the Figure, The lowesttriangle (No. 4.)adds the lower limbs, and the tail ofthe Bull, Eagle and Lion.<3” >When Air and Fire predominate there is a maletendency. When Water and Earth, thetype tendeth tofemale.It is to be understood that what is here written re-garding the Sphynx of thePyramid and the God ofEgypt ruling above is applicable especially unto the16squares of the Servient Angels in each lesser angle.Concerning the Skrying of the Squares Servient inthe Spirit Vision. Have inreadiness the necessary im-plements and insignia; also let the ZelatorAdeptusMinor have before him the svmbol of the Pyramid ofthe square. Rehearsethe Angelic calls appropriatethereunto and, having invoked the appropriatenamesgoverning the Plane and division thereof in question,let the Z.A.M. imagineunto himself that he is enclosedwithin that Pyramid. Or let him believe that heis vol-untarily standing within an atmosphere correspondingunto that symbolisedby the Pyramid of the Square,whether of Heat or Moisture, of Cold or Dryness, orofcombinations of these.Let him then endeavour to follow the Ray therefromunto the limits of theMacrocosmic world and to findhimself in a scene corresponding unto the nature ofthePyramid Square. That is, either of landscape, or clouds,or water, or fire, orether, vapour, or mist, or rayinglight, or a combination or combinations ofthese, ac-cording unto the nature of the Plane.For the Pyramids of the Squares are not solid pyra-mids of brick or stone builtby the hand of man. Butrather the symbolical representation of theelementalformula governing the plane of that particular sphere.Having arrived at the plane required, let the Z.A.M.invoke the God of Egypt whoruleth above the Pyra-mid by the power of the Angel of the Sphere—thename formedby adding the appropriate Tablet ofUnion letter to the Angel’s name. At the sametime,vibrate the Egyptian (Coptic) Name of the God orGoddess, whereby he shallperceive before him the< 312 >colossal symbolic form of the God or Goddess. Let himagain use the Angelicformulae, and test it by the powerof symbols and signs. If it abide these tests,thus show-ing it is a true image, then let him request it to makemanifest beforehim the Sphynx of its power.This shall also appear in a colossal figure and shape,and should be tested bythe proper formula. He shallcontinue his invocations until he can behold itclearly,ever invoking the Angel of the plane by the superiorNames, and by theGod of Egypt. Also let him vibratethe name of the Angel, invoking it by its ownname,and by the knowledge of its symbolic (telesmatic)image, the Sphynx and bythe name of the God ofEgypt, and by his own particular symbolic form, ac-cordingto the formula of the Square. Thus thereforein this manner only—if thou wishestto escape fromdelusion—shalt thou be able to discern truly, by skry-ing, thenature of the plane and of its operation.Standing before the Sphynx, andsaluting it with theproper signs, and invoking the God of Egypt by hisproper andtrue names, thou shalt ask by the virtueand power of those symbols and names forthe knowl-edge of the operations and influences of that plane.Thou shalt askconcerning the special attributes of thatvast portion of the confines of theuniverse included inthat sphere, its varying nature, its elemental nature;itsinhabitants, elemental and spiritual etc.; the opera-tion of its rays throughthe Greater World, that is, theUniverse; of its influence upon this particularplanet,upon animals, plants, minerals, and lastly upon manthe Microcosm.And when thou shalt have obtained all this reflectthat even then it is but asmall part of the knowledgeof the Wisdom of the Formulae contained intheplane—even of that one square.NOTES RY FRATRE S.R.M.D.For quick working, make sixteen plain triangles; 4red, 4 blue, 4 yellow, and 4black.Make also Kerubic Figures. A red lion, a black bull,< 3*3 >blue eagles, yellow angel. (Note: These should be madeail about the same heightand width, so that when theyare cut, the separate pieces may be piecedtogether—as in a jig saw puzzle—in different combinations, with-out there beingtoo great a discrepancy in size.—I. R.).Divide each into three; the centre piecebeing halvedby a horizontal cut. From these make compositesphynxes to lay underthe pyramid. (Note: the Sphynxin this instance becomes a synthetic kerubicfigure.Thus you can make a Sphynx with the head of aLion, the shoulders andwings of an Eagle, the body ofa Man, and the hind-legs and tail of a Bull,etc.—I.R.).Make small Egyptian Gods to place above thePyramid. (Note: When drawing theseGod forms if alittle tongue is left at the bottom of the card-boardon which theform is painted, that tongue can be fittedvery easily into a slot of about thesame size at the topor throne of the Pyramid.—I.R.).Make a shallow inverted Pyramid of card-board. Fillthe sides as required withthe coloured triangles torepresent the several squares. Let the Pyramid beshal-low enough to show all four sides at once.These be the Gods of Egypt who rule above thePyramids of the sixteen servientAngels and squares ofeach Lesser Angle. In the middle of each pyramid isthesphynx of its power. Revere then the sacred sym-bols of the Gods, for they arethe Word manifestedin the Voice of Nature.These be the Elohim of the Forces of the Eternal,and before their faces theforces of Nature are prostrate.(Note: It is perhaps hardly necessary to suggest tothe student that he shouldnot attempt to employ theSphynx and God-form formula with the Pyramid untilhehas had much experience in ordinary Tattwa vision.When he has become perfectlyacquainted with thenature of the subtle planes, and has learned to applythesimple forms of tests, so that he is quick to detectimposition or deception,then he may skry in the planessymbolized by the Pyramids.—I.R.)<3H>No. ElementsCoptic= jo] Officers1 SPIRIT: or onetriangle of eachelement2 WATER: or3 out of 4 Water3 EARTH: or3 out of 4 Earth4 FIRE: or3 out of 4 Fire$ AIR: or3 out of 4 Air6 2 WATER2 EARTH7 2 FIRE2 WATER8 2 AIRa WATERo 2 FIREz EARTHHuwtopiCOOSIRISHicttOISISNEPHITHYSZuj copHorusApHcorepi f£)AROUERiS #ATHOR./\\za©o)iop50THISHARPOC RATESHierophanton ThronePraemonstratorImperatorHtereusPast HierophantHiero, off ThroneInvisible StationKerub of EastInvisible StationKerub of WestInvisible Stationto121314IS2 AIR2 EARTH2 FIRE2 AIRZiOtOpTTOUpflt between Altar andI legemonAPIS Invisible Station/\\ZaTTOJtL Kerub of NorthANUBIS KeruxAooor/3LPASHT CSeKKc't Invisible StationKerub of South©ap4>£UAFIRE WATER AMESHETEARTHFIRE WATER AHEPH lAIR A*e4>1EARTH TMOUMATHPHWATER AIR HhMTMa©4EARTH AIR KA&EXNUVFIRE Kape^NiryInvisible Station N.E.Child of HorusInvisible Station S.W.Child of HorusInvisible Station S.E.Child of HorusInvisible Station N.W.Child of Horus“ST” or £ added to a Coptic deity name represents a morespiritual force since Cis attributed to Kether.< 315 >Picture #64 [images/img_0064.bmp]Color KeyPicture #65 [images/img_0065.bmp]Greer\\YellowPicture #66 [images/img_0066.bmp]White and blackare as shown onor\\ the sketches.< 3i6 >Picture #67 [images/img_0067.bmp]Picture #68 [images/img_0068.bmp]Picture #69 [images/img_0069.bmp]Picture #70 [images/img_0070.bmp]Picture #71 [images/img_0071.bmp]Picture #72 [images/img_0072.bmp]Orarv^e headSlue NemyssStripes: black,pnancje ^yel lowBlue beadGraa^z: WernyssStnpes; blue*■ yef !o WBlack heod,Ye I low NcmysS-Stripes- Butz,yal low, + block.V/hite head witkblack 4- ye I lo WStripes; red,yellowy black-<3*7 >Picture #73 [images/img_0073.bmp]In order to show something of the nature of theseEnochian pyramids as revealedby skrying therein withthe spirit-vision, I have thought it advisable toincludehere two or three examples of simple visions obtainedby members of theold Order. These are provided onlyas instances of the procedure and results tobe obtained.Under no circumstances should the student permit hisown skryingresearches to be influenced and mouldedby these visions. He must not attempt tomake his ownaccounts of the nature of the Pyramids accord withthose given here.The technique alone should be noted,and the manner of applying tests—but nothingfurtherthan that should be used in actual practice.I. “A vision of the ‘N’ square in the Airy LesserAngle of the Water Tablet. Thefull name is nhdD, andthe Pyramid God is Ahephi.“Having recited the 4th and 10th Enochian Calls,and invoked the Angelic Names ofthe Tablet of Water,and the Airy Angle, I was carried up by the gentlemovingwaves of warm moist Air, through which Icould see bright blue sky with greyishwhite cloudsmoving across rapidly. I rose in the Air till I foundmyself on avast sandy plain, on the right little vege-tation, on the left a broad riverwith trees and grass onits banks. A cool breeze was blowing from the riveracrossthe plain, and seemed to refresh the green afterthe heat of the day.“I called on Ahephi to appear and the form graduallyfilled the place till thescene disappeared altogether.Tested by the letters, it grew immensely larger,andseemed to have a yellow and blue striped Nemyss,whitish wrappings, with broadblue bands round it,and a greenish yellow light shown about it. I gave theL.V.X.signs and asked to be shown the Sphinx of itspower. This gradually appearedthrough the yellowlight behind the God-form, human head, very fair andbrightface, wings, yellow and blue nemyss, claws ofEagle extended in front, andhind-legs and tail of alion in reclining position.< 3^ >“On asking for the action of the force of the Square,was shown a bubble of Waterinto which Air was con-tinually pouring, and expanding it till it burstanddisappeared, the energy seeming then to pass into otherforms and come underthe rule of another square. Itseemed a transitory action, more the initiator offreshconditions than an end in itself. I asked its effect onthe earth, and wastaken to the scene I had left, andsaw again how the moist breeze from the rivergavefresh life to the vegetation which had flagged duringthe day. Asking itseffect on the animal world, wasshown a Deer standing by a lake. A current offorcepassing over it, seemed to bring the dawn of reasonand glimmering ofconsciousness, the first consciousstirrings of an animal. Acting on man, itseemed toaffect the brain, producing a vague waving motionwhich prevented fixityof thought and definiteness ofidea, loss of the power of concentration.“I then asked to see the elementals of the plane, andsaw numbers of small-sizedhuman figures, fair, activeexpression on face, bodies rather solid-lookingcom-pared to the head, large wings like dragon flies whichwere irridescent andseemed to reflect the colouring ofthings about them.\"I gave the 5 = 6 Signs to the Sphinx and then calledon the Angel of the Square.I saw above the God thefigure I had drawn—the Wings on the Crown wereblue, thecuirass bright steel with the Eagle symbolon the breast in gold, the draperybelow was a yellowishgreen, and the feet bare.”2. “A Vision of the Square “1” of the Earthy LesserAngle of the Tablet of Air.Name ISha. Anoubt is thePyramid God.“This atmosphere was damp and cold. I stood on thesummit of a mountain,cloud-enwrapped, and there,having rehearsed the Angelical Calls, and vibratedthenames, I beheld the colossal form of Anubis, who, aftera time, shewed me theSphinx of his Power. This againshewed me a mighty Angel who answered my signs,< 3!9 >and when in that of the Theoricus I saw that a brilliantray descended into theoutstretched palm of each ofher hands. On my asking for guidance andinformation,she gave me one of these rays, which I beheld as acrystal cord whoseother end rested in the Eternal. TheAngel led me first among the Ethers, andafter a spaceI beheld stars and worlds innumerable.“Through the brighter Suns, particles passed—comingout the other side asblackened cinders. Then cameforth a mighty hand which gathered these cindersandwelded them into a mass, lifeless and vast. Then wepassed to this Earth—to afrigid scene, all snow andhuge blocks of ice. The cold was intense, but I feltitnot. Here were polar bears, and seals, as also many seagulls. In places, theice was stationery, but again it wasviolently moved, block crashing againstblock withdeafening roar. The inhabitants of the place were smalland bloodless,wrapped chiefly in the skins of polarbears.“The influence of this square on Man, makes himviolently impetuous in theabsence of difficulty, butinstantly hopeless in the face of an obstacle,abandon-ing at once every project. The Elementals are demure,bird-like creatureswith semi-human faces. The spiritualbeings are beautiful diaphanous Angels,light brown incolour, with sweet serious faces. They were all muchoccupied whenI saw them. Some had silver in theirleft hands and mercury in their right, whichthey wouldput into a golden vessel together, whence immediatelya pale goldcoloured flame which ever increased in size,spreading out through the Worlds.Others bearing thelegend ‘Solve et Coagula’ woven into their belts, mixedwaterand the principle of cold which they bore in apair of scales, and the union wasthe ice of the regionwe were in. T was wondering whether all this hadanycounterpart in human nature, and its possibilities ofdevelopment when I sawtwo types. One an ancientman toiling along most painfully and the other achildskipping along light-heartedly. As they faded there rose< 320 >between them a radiant figure clad in gold, bearing onher brow the sign Libra inliving emerald. Then Iunderstood that only in and by the reconciliation ofthesetwo forces, the fixed and the volatile is ‘the path-way of true equilibrium’found. On asking for plantsI was shown mushrooms, which seemed to beparticu-larly consonant to this square.”3. “A vision of the square ‘C’ in the Watery LesserAngle of the Air Tablet.Name: CPao. Hoorpokrati,the Pyramid God.“Read the 3rd and 7th Calls. Vibrated Oro IbahAozpi, Bataivah, the Angel CPao.The Egyptian Godis Hoorpokrati.“Found myself in the air in the midst of whirlingclouds. Travelled on by theabove names. Saw theAngel of colossal size clothed in white. Tested with aletterTau and Beth placed over the form, but therewas no change, so removed thoseletters. Clouds seemedto be floating around the Angel. Saluted with LVXSigns andasked to see Egyptian God, who appearedequally colossal while the Angel floatedup above hishead. Tested as before.“Vibrated Hoorpokrati second time, saluted as before,and asked to see theSphinx, both Angel and Har-pocrates returning the saluting sign. Sphinx thenap-peared with Eagle head, lower part human, on one sideEagle’s wings, the otherside human arms. Tested andsaluted as before. The Sphinx was of colossal size.“Now I vibrated all the names repeatedly, and askedto see the meaning of theSquare. I was told that itwas the astral region of storm and rain cloudswithwind. I saw elementals in grey or pearly robes floatingon the white fleecyclouds. (Note: I get them greyerand less defined.—D.D.C.F.) On dark thundercloudswere forms in dark lurid grey raiment, bearing thunder-bolts like theimages attributed to Zeus; many eagle-headed forms among them. Presently I sawone with aCrown. I asked him to show me, and he took me by thehand and wetraversed an enormous distance beyond< 321 >the Earth which became invisible. Then we soared up-wards still in the midst ofthe same surroundings, tillI saw the Sun of that region, shining brightly,butclouds frequently drifting across it, while the cloudswere now below us butonly partially so. He told methat the nature of this Square was to supply theforceson the Astral Plane which generate wind, rain, clouds,and storm on thenatural plane. That these occurredthroughout the Universe but with differenteffect. Thaton our evil planet the effect was sometimes disastrous,beingperverted from their original intention by ourevil sphere. But on other higherplanes the effect wasalways beneficial, clearing away that which had ful-filledits purpose and replacing it by fresh influence.The region attributed to thisSquare seemed simplylimitless. We traversed an enormous distance, yetseemed nonearer the end. So he brought me backagain. Then I thanked him and saluted him,and de-scended to the former plane. There I thanked andsaluted the Angel,Hoorpokrati, and the Sphinx. SoI returned home, dimly seeing my natural bodybeforere-entering it.”< 322 >FURTHER RULES FOR PRACTICEBy G. H. Fratre Supere Aude1. Prepare for private use Four Tablets with correctlettering as given in theOfficial Lecture; and aTablet of Union.2. Make the Four Tablets coloured as brilliantly andas dashingly as possible,and in exact proportion.This should be done with coloured papers. Theymay bedone in water-colours, but this is not sogood. (Enamel or Lacquer paints arebest.—I.R.)3. The Four minor Implements are to be used withthe Enochian Tablets. A smallAltar should bearranged in the room at the time of working. Itshould be drapedwith a black cloth, with a lightedcandle by the wand, incense burning by thedagger,gold and silver or bread and salt with the Pentacle,and Water in the Cup.4. Use the Ritual of the Hexagram for the Invoca-tion of the King and the SixSeniors.5. Use the Ritual of the Pentagram for the Spirit andthe Four Elements.6. The Calvary Cross Names call forth with a word ofSix Letters and command witha word of Five.They rule the Lesser Angles in which they aresituated, and shouldbe used in the preliminaryinvocation.7. The Six Seniors and Kings are on a higher planeand should be invoked with theHexagram Ritual.The Names of the Six Seniors are each of Sevenletters, that ofthe King Eight.8. The Deity Names consist of a Name of Three let-ters, Four letters and Fiveletters, respectively,corresponding to the Supernal Triad, IAO. Also tothe triadof YHVH, Yeheshuah, Yehovashah.<323 >9- The Name of the King and the Letters from thecentres of the Great CentralCrosses initiate theWhirl, and should not be used by those who donot understandits action.10. Remember that the East is attributed to Air,South to Fire, West to Water,North to Earth,when you summon Spirits or Forces. When, how-ever, you go to seekSpirits or Forces on their ownplanes, the attribution of the elements totheCardinal points is as in the Zodiac, as follows:East to Fire, South to Earth,West to Air, Northto Water.n. Bearing this in mind, place yourself (imaginative-ly) in the centre of ahollow cube, standing in thecentre of the Tablet of Union between the 0 ofHCOMAand the second N of NANTA:E X A R PHCOMAxNANTAB I T O MNow imagine the Four Elemental Tablets standinground you like the four walls ofa room, that is,at the four cardinal points. This is subjectiveworking.12. Another method is to imagine a moonstonespheroid, containing the Universe,yourself stand-ing as it were, at first, in the centre, and the Tabletof Unionat the North and South Poles. At thesame time divide the surface into fourquarters,and imagine yourself outside the spheroid. This isobjective working.13. These Tablets can be applied to the Universe, tothe Solar System, to theEarth, or to Man him-self. “As above, so below.”14. Perhaps the most convenient method for a be-ginner to adopt is to apply thisscheme to the< 324 >Earth, treating the Three Deity names as theThree Signs of the Zodiac in onequarter. For ex-ample, take the Fire Tablet and place OIP on theSign Leo, TEAAin Virgo, and PDOCE in Libra.And so on with the other God Names, treatingtheKerubic Sign as the point de depart, one quarterof a house in Astrology beingroughly equal to thesquare of each letter.Each of these spaces, under these circumstances,would appear to be governed by aheroic figure of, say,twelve feet high, not winged. But the Spirit Namesand theNames above the Calvary Cross, even on theEarth plane, bring forth figures oftremendous size andbeauty, which could easily lift a human being in thepalm ofthe hand. From the fiery Lesser Angle of Fire,I have seen AZODIZOD, the figurebeing fiery redwith flaming wings and hair of emerald green.ZODAZODEE, black andwhite, flashing and flaming.EEZODAHZOD, blue and orange, with a mist offlameabout him. ZODEEZODAH, orange, with hazy goldwings like gold gauze, andnets of gold around him.Having selected one of the above methods, let theZelator Adeptus Minor performthe Lesser BanishingRituals with the Sword. Invoke, with the minor imple-ment,the Element required.Our example being the Square of OMDI, a wateryand earthy square in the LesserAngle of Earth in theGreat Southern Quadrangle or Fire Tablet, we take theFireWand. In the four quarters we invoke, with theequilibriating Pentagram forActives, and the FirePentagram, using only the Tablet Names: “EDEL-PERNAA, (theGreat King of the South). VOLEXDOand SIODA, (the two Deity Names on theSephiroticCalvary Cross). I command ye in the Divine NameOIP TEAA PEDOCE andBITOM that the Angelwho governs the Watery and Earthy square of OMDIshall obeymy behest and submit to me when I utterthe holy name OOMDI (pronouncedOh-Oh-Meh-Deh-ee).”<325 >Having repeated this Invocation in the Four Quar-ters, turn to the East if youwish to go to the plane,or to the South if you wish to invoke the Spirits tocometo you. Look at the painted Tablet which youhave prepared until you can carry itin your mind, thenclose the eyes and vibrate the name OMDI andOOMDI until yourwhole body trembles and you al-most feel a sensation of burning.(The items which follow are quite open to discussionand are simply my ownpersonal experience.—S.A.)Then pass through the Tablets and try to see somesortof landscape. My experience of this particularplane was a dull red crumblingearth. I first foundmyself in a Cave. As a symbol I was told that thisSquare ofOMDI was like the roots of a tiger lily; theSquare MDIO to the right,representing the Life work-ing in it. The square IOMD to the left, representedthesap flowing through the stalk and the leaves, as it were;the Square DIOM tothe left of that, the orange flowerwith the black spots upon it, fitlyrepresenting Air, Fireand Earth—yellow, red and black.Afterwards I invoked the King and Six Seniors toexplain the general bearings ofthe Quadrangle. Afterpassing through several fiery planes, each of themofgreater whiteness and brilliance than the last, I seemedto be stationed on ahigh tower situated in the centreof the Quadrangle between the two a’s in thecentreof the Great Cross, and I was told by the Six Seniorsthat they were partlyrepresentative of the planets,but that their Names should really be read in acircle,in a way we should be taught later, etc.Final note. From the lectures circulated among theAdepti, (S.A. here refers tocertain statements madein the Clavtcula Tabularum Enochi which ishereomitted.—I.R.), I have gathered that the Angels placedover the KerubicSquares of the Lesser Angles of theGreat Quadrangle have the followingproperties:Air Angle. “Knitting together and destruction.” Cen-< 326 >trifugal and centripetal forces. Expansive and contrac-tive, etc.Water Angle, “Moving from place to place.” Motion,vibration, changing of forms.Earth Angle. “Mechanical crafts.” Creative or pro-ductive of results on thematerial plane.Fire Angle. “Secrets of Humanity.” Controllinghuman nature, clear vision, etc.And that the Subservient Angels of these Angles,that is the Angels of thesixteen servient squares underthe Sephirotic Cross, rule:Air Angle, “Elixirs.” Purification from illusions, dis-eases, sins, etc. bysublimation.Water Angle. “Metals.” The right methods of polar-ising the Soul so as toattract the LVX.Earth Angle. “Stones.” The fixing of the Higher Selfin the purified body.Fire Angle. “Transmutations.” The consecration ofthe body and the transmutationbrought about byconsecration.(It is to be noted that the Lesser Angles in eachQuadrangle have identicalproperties and qualitiesdiffering only according to the primary Element oftheTablet in whic hthey are situated. That is, the LesserAngle of Air in the AirQuadrangle will be very similarin nature to the Lesser Angle of Air in theWaterTablet, or the Earth and Fire Tablets; and that theonly difference betweenthem will be in the nature oftheir particular Quadrangle. The Lesser Angle ofAiris said to be concerned with “physic” or healing. Theuse of the Lesser Angleof Air in the Fire Tablet wouldhave to be for quite different objects andpurposes thanfor example the Air Lesser Angle of the Earth Tablet.And so for theother Lesser Angles in the primaryElements.—I.R.)< 327 >PART THREETHE CONCOURSEO FTHE FORCESTHE FORTY-EIGHT ANGELICALKEYS OR CALLSThese Calls or Keys which follow are only to be madeuse of with the greatestcare and solemnity; especiallyif they be pronounced in the Angelical Languageasgiven. Anyone profaning them by using them with animpure mind, and without adue knowledge of theirattribution and application, shall be liable tobringserious spiritual and physical harm unto himself.The first Nineteen Calls or Keys, of which 18 aloneare expressed, are attributedunto, and to be used with,The Tablet of Union and the Four otherTerrestrialEnochian Tablets.The first Key hath no number and cannot be ex-pressed, seeing that it is of theGod-Head. And there-fore it hath the number of O with us, though in theAngelicOrders it is called First. Therefore, their SecondKey is with us the First.Unto the Tablet of Union are attributed Six Calls,of which the First is thehighest and above the otherfive .The remaining Twelve Calls, together withFourof those belonging unto the Tablet of Union, areallotted unto the FourTablets of the Elements.The First Key governeth generally, that is as awhole, the Tablet of Union. It isto be used first in allinvocations of the Angels of that Tablet but not at all< 328 >in the invocations of the Angels of the other fourTablets.The Second Key is to be used as an invocation ofthe Angels of the LettersE.H.N.B. representing theespecial governance of the Spirit in the TabletofUnion. It is also to precede in the second place all in-vocations of theAngels of that Tablet. Like the FirstKey it is not to be employed in theinvocations of theAngels of the four other Tablets.(The Numbers such as 456 and 6739, etc. whichoccur in some of the Calls containmysteries which arenot here to be explained.)The next Four Keys or Calls are used both in theInvocations of the Angels of theTablet of Union, andin those of the Angels of the Four Terrestrial Tabletsaswell. Thus:The Third Key is to be used for the invocation of theAngels of the letters ofthe line EXARP, for those ofthe Air Tablet as a whole, and for the Lesser Angleofthis Tablet which is that of the Element itself—Air ofAir.The Fourth Key is to be used for the Invocation ofthe Angels of the letters ofthe line HCOMA, for thoseof the Water Tablet as a whole, and for the LesserAngleof this Tablet—Water of Water.The Fifth Key is to be used for the Invocation ofthe Angels of the letters ofthe line NANTA, for thoseof the Tablet of Earth as a whole, and for theLesserAngle of this Tablet—Earth of Earth.The Sixth Key is to be used for the Invocation of theAngels of the letters ofthe line BITOM, for those of theTablet of Fire as a whole, and for the LesserAngle ofthis Tablet—Fire of Fire.This finishes the employment of the Keys of theTablet of Union. The remainingTwelve Keys refer tothe remaining Lesser Angles of the Four TerrestrialTablets,as hereafter set forth in the following Table.< 329 >KEYNo. ofFIRST WORDSGOVERNMENT1sti reign over you, saith the Godof Justice.Tablet of Unionas a whole.2ndCan the Wings of the Windsunderstand your Voices of Wonder.E.H.N.B.3rdBehold, saith your God, I am aCircle, on whose hands standTwelve Kingdoms.EXARP andTablet of AinIDOIGO andAir of Air.4thI have set my feet in the Southand have looked about me, saying:HCOMA andTablet of Water.NELAPR andWater of Water.5*hThe Mighty Sounds have enteredinto the Third Angle,NANTA andTablet of Earth.CABALPT andEarth of Earth.6thThe Spirits of the Fourth Angleare Nine, mighty in the Firma-ment of Waters.BITOM andTablet of Fire.RZIONR andFire of Fire,7thThe East is a House of Virginssinging praises amongst the Flamesof First Glory.Water of AirLILACZA.8thThe mid-day, the First, is as theThird Heaven made of Hyacin-thine Pillars,Earth of AirAIAOAI,9thA mighty Guard of Fire with two-edged Swords naming:Fire of AirAOUVRRZ.10thThe Thunders of Judgment andWrath are numbered, and areharboured in the North inthelikeness of an Oak,Air of WaterOBLGOTCA,nthThe Mighty Seats groaned aloudand there were five thunderswhich flew into theEast.Earth of WaterMALADL12 th0 you that reign in the South andare 28, the Lanterns of Sorrow,Fire of WaterIAAASD,13th0 you Swords of the South whichhave 42 eyes to stir up the Wrathof Sin,Air of EarthANGFOI.14th0 you Sons of Fury, the Childrenof the Just which sit upon 24 seats.Water of EarthANAEEM.15th0 Thou, the Governor of the FirstFlame, under whose wings are6739 which ewave.< 33° >Fire of EarthOSPMNIR.No. ofKEYFIRST WORDSGOVERNMENT16th0 Thou, Second Flame, the Houseof justice, which hast thy Begin-nings in Glory,Atr of FireNOALMR.17th0 1 hou Third Flame, whose wingsare thorns to stir up vexation:Water of FireVADALI18th0 Thou mighty Light, and burn-ing flame of comfort.Earth of FireUVOLBXDOWherefore, unto the Tablet of AIR are attributedthe 3rd, 7th, 8th, and 9th KEYS.Unto the Tablet ofEARTH, the 4th, toth, nth, and 12th KEYS. Untothe Tablet ofEARTH, the 5th, 13th, 14th, and 15thKEYS. And unto the Tablet of FIRE, the 6th,t6th,and 17th and 18th KEYS.So that, to invoke, for example, the Angels of the lineNAN FA of the Tablet ofUnion, thou shalt first readthe First and Second Keys, and then the FifthKey,and then employ the necessary Names.And to invoke the Angels of the Lesser AngleIDOIGO, Air Angle of the Tablet ofAir, thou shaltread the Third Key only, and then employ the neces-sary Names.But to invoke the Angels of the Lesser AngleVADALI, Water Angle of the Tablet ofFIRE, thoushalt first read the Sixth Key, and then the 17th Key,and after thatuse the necessary Names. Whereas, forthe Angle of FIRE OF FIRE therein, theSixth Keyalone would suffice, as also for the King and AngelicalSeniors of thatTablet.And so of the other Angles of the other Tablets,these rules shall suffice.Now, though these CALLS are thus to be employedto aid thee in the Skrying of theTablets in the SpiritVision, and in magical working therewith, yet shaltthouknow that they be allotted unto a much higherplane than the operation of theTablets in the Assiatic< 33i >World. And, therefore, are they thus employed in bring-ing the Higher Light andthe All-Potent Forces intoaction herein; and so also, are they not to beprofaned,or used lightly with an impure or frivolous mind asbefore said.Also these CALLS may be employed in the invoca-tion of the Chiefs of theElementals according to thetitle of the Book T associated therewith. And inthiscase, it will be well to employ the names of the Arch-angels Michael,Raphael, etc., and their inferiors. Andthou shalt understand that these Hebrewnames aremore general as representing Offices; while those of theAngelic Tabletsare more particular as representingNatures.The Calls or Keys of the Thirty Aethers be all one inform, only that theparticular name of the Aether inquestion is employed, such as ARN, ZAA, etc.< 332 >THE FIRST KEYH reign over you 2Saith the God of Justice 3In power exalted abovel0l SonfVorsag 2Goho lad Balt 2LonshJThe Firmament of Wrath: 2In Whose hands 3The Sun is as a swordlCalzVonpho2Sobra Z~0l l{Ror I Ta Nazps4And the Moon 2 As a thorough-thrusting fire: sWho measurethl0d Graa 2Ta Malprg ^Ds Hol-Q1 Your garments in the midst of my vestures 2And trussed you togetherxQaa NothoaZimz 20d Commah1As the palms of my hands: 2Whose seat SI garnished with the firexTa Nobtoh Zien 2Soba Tkil zGnonp Prge4Qf gathering: 2Who beautified 3Your garments with admiration:1Aldi 2Ds Vrbs 30bolek G Rsam*To Whom I made a law govern the Holy Ones: 3Who delivered you1 Gas arm Ohorela2T aba Pit zDs Zonrensg'A rod 2With the Ark of Knowledge. 3Moreover Ye lifted up Your%Cab 2Erm ladnah^PUafi Farzm1 Voices and sware 2Obedience and faith 3To Him 4That liveth andlZnrza 2AdnaGone 3/adpU 4Ds Horn Od1Triumpheth: 2Whose beginning is not 3Nor end cannot be: 4WhichlTok 2Soba Ipam3LuIpamis 4Ds^hineth as a flame in the midst of your palace 2And reigneth1Loholo* Vep Zomd Poamal 20d Bogpa^Amongst you as the balance 2Of righteousness and truth. 3MovelAai Ta Piap2Piamol Od Vaoan sZacare^Therefore and show yourselves: -Open the mysteries of yourl(e) Ca Od Zamran 2Odo GicleCreation. 2Be friendly unto me 3For I am ^ 4The servant of the samexQaa 2Zorge3Lap Zirdo 4Noco4Your God, ^The true worshipper of 3The Highest.xMad 2Hoath 2Iaida.TABLET OF UNION.•(Or Sobolo; I am not certain which.)TABLET OF UNION£XAR.pHcOMANANTABiToM< 333 >THE SECOND KEYGan the Wings of the Winds Understand your voices of wonder1Adgt Vpaah Zong 20mFamp Said3Q You the Second of the First 2Whom the burning flames 3Have framediVirl-V L2Sobam lal-Prg zJ-Za-Zaz1 Within the depth of my jaws: 2Whom 3I have prepared as cups for aipi-A dph2Casar?na zAbramg Ta Talho^Wedding 2Or as the flowers in their beauty 3For the Chamber of thelParacleda ~QTa Lorslq Turks 3OogeRighteous. ^Stronger are your feet 3Than the barren stone 4And1Baltoh 2Givi ChisLusd 30rri 4OdJMightier 2Are your voices than the Manifold Winds. 3For ye are1Micalp 2Ckis BiaOzongon 2 Lap3Become 2A building such as 8Is not save in the mind of thelNoan 2Trof Cots Ta&Ge 0 Q Manin1 All-Powerful 2Arise, 3Saith the First. 4Move* ^Therefore, GUntolIa~Idon 2Torzu3Gohe L 4Zacar S(F) Oa fiC*Thy servants. 2Show yourselves 3In power and make me 4A strong seer1Noqod2Zamran 3Micalzo Od Ozazm 4VrelpJOf things* for I am of Him 2That liveth forever.lLap Zir HQ-lad.Rules Letters E.

No one in the Order, or my Temple, seemedtoknow anything about it. Whether this same conditionapplies to the otherTemples is hard to say, though,from conversation with certain of the Adepti ofthoseTemples, I gather the same conditions there prevailed.Nothing that was ofpractical value, as throwing anylight on the nature and function of the game,wasthrown on the subject by any of the Order memberswithin the sphere of myacquaintance. It is probablethat the knowledge of this system died with theearlymembers. All that I ever heard were fulsome praisesof its remarkabledivinatory capacity, together withquite a few amusing comments by those whomani-festly knew nothing about it, though no precise indica-tion was conveyed asto its procedure. On two of threeoccasions I have asked Adepti of the rank of ©— 0to play a game with me using my chess pieces andboards, though each politelybacked out of the invita-tion. Also the unmounted state of the Orderchess-pieces was a clear indication that they had never andcould never have beenemployed—like other aspects ofthe Order teaching. And the actual documents onthesubject that were shown to me were vague and obvi-ously incomplete, giving noindication as to the truenature of this matter. No doubt it was intended, by< 346 >those who wrote the papers and devised the system,that the Adept should applyhis own ingenuity to thebare-bones provided of the game, and formulate fromthatskeleton outline, as from the Enochian Tabletsthemselves, a complete system ofinitiation, and a pro-found magical philosophy. It is not therefore myintentionto say very much about Rosicrueian chess,although it can be stated that theperspicacious studentwill divine ideas of great import and discover a depthofmagical significance hidden under the cloak of anapparently trivial game.However, the student who has mastered the fore-going sections of the Book of theConcourse of theForces will no doubt be able to divine the relationshipexistingbetween the profundities of the EnochianTablets and this chess-game. It willhave been neces-sary as a preliminary step to have become perfectlyfamiliar withthe attributions of the Squares, so thatany pyramid can be built upinstantaneously in theimagination too. By this, I mean, that while playingachess-game, the movement of a piece from one squareto another should providemuch material for thought,for the squares on the boards, as on the Tablets,maybe formulated as Pyramids. Some experience, also, inemploying the Pyramidsfor skrying in the Spirit-Vision will be required before any real appreciationofEnochan chess can be acquired.In this game, the pieces are Egyptian god-forms, andthe boards are certainadaptations of the EnochianTabelts. The Tablet of Union, however, is notused.Tablets are reproduced as Chess-boards minus theGreat Central Cross, theSephirotic Cross, and theKerubic Squares over the Calvary Cross in eachLesserAngle. This leaves only the Servient squares in each ofthe Four LesserAngles—sixteen in number, which givesus sixty-four squares per board—the numberof squaresin the ordinary chess-board.One of the papers written by Greatly HonouredFratre N.O.M., gives a shorthistory of Chess as it was< 347 >derived from the Indian Chaturanga, the PersianShatranji, and the Arabic Chess.But since it containsvery little that is of any practical import, I havethoughtbetter not to include it.A few words now as to the nature of the Boards.The Boards consist of the purelyelemental part of eachTablet. There is nothing in the symbolic structure oftheBoard to suggest the operation of the Spirit in anyof it saspects through theElements. This operation ofthe Spirit and its potencies, however, is indicatednotby the squares, but by the pieces and their movementsover the board.To be of any real magical value, the board should bea sort of Talisman orFlashing Tablet. That is, it shouldbe fully painted, showing all the trianglesof the Pyra-mids as brightly and as dashingly as possible. The littleflatsquares shown at the summit of the Pyramid, indi-cating the throne of thegod-form, are not necessary onthese boards. The triangles are completely formed,andthe resulting pyramidal shape is not truncated. The fourAngles of each Tabletwill thus stand out quite brightly,since the elemental colour of the quarterwill show itsnature, even though the triangles of yellow, blue, blackand redwill jostle each other cheek by jowl. When fullypainted, the board is mostimpressive as a flashingTablet. The student may know he has done hisworkproperly when there appear white flashings at theangles of the squares. Thisis important, for the objectof a flashing Tablet is to attract an appropriatetype offorce. And if these chess-boards are made as FlashingTablets, they willautomatically attract force and theirutilisation will become the moresignificant. In brief,each square is, as it were, the name and symbolicaddressof a different Angelic force. The flashing squareswill attract the commencementof the operation of thattype of Angelic power, and the movement of theChessGod-forms over the squares may produce even brighterflashes and indicatethe operation of the divine forces< 348 >therein. With these hints the student is left to work thisout for himself.There will be, in short, four different Boards, Eachis representative of one ofthe Four Quadrangles orWatch-towers of the Elements, and the Angelic Nameson thelatter will be implied on the Boards even al-though no letters or Names arepainted on them. Theuse of any of the four Boards will depend upon par-ticularpurposes, and the attributions of Elements asin the diverse schemes ofDivination will determinewhich of the four boards must be used at any giventime.In Tarot, the Element of Air, the Sword suit,indicates Sickness and Sorrow andunhappiness gen-erally. Hence, in Enochian chess, for diving for somesuchquestion as touches upon trouble or unhappinessthe Air Board would be employed.1 he Fire Board willrepresent the Tarot suit of Wands, implyingswiftness,energy, activity. The Water Board indicates the Tarotsuit of Cups ofpleasure, happiness, merry-making, andmarriage. The Earth Board will refer toall materialplane matters of money, work, employment, occupa-tion, and so forth.The Four Boards of the Rosicrucian game, althoughdifferent, nevertheless agreein certain particulars. Ineach board it is convenient to speak of thearrangementof the Lesser Angles as an Upper and Lower Rank—Air and Water formingthe Upper Rank, and Earthand Fire the Lower.It is evident that the columns of the one Rank arecontinuous with those of theother; and in this continu-ity a certain regular rule is observable. Everycolumnof eight squares commencing in the Upper Rank iscontinued below by acolumn of the opposite Element.Thus the Fiery columns below invariably stand onthe Watery columns; the Wateryon the Fiery; theAiry on the Earthy; and the Earthy on the Airy.A different arrangement of the horizontal Files orRanks of Squares isobservable, and there is a differencein the Upper and Lower Tablets.< 349 >In the Upper Tablets the Kerubic Rank of squares iscontinuous with the ElementalRank; and the Cardinalis continuous with the Common sign Rank, whereasin thelower Tablets of Earth and Fire the variousRanks—Kerubic, Cardinal, etc., arecontinuous rightacross the board.The pieces employed are, as previously remarked,Egyptian God-forms. A full setof chess-pieces numberstwenty men and sixteen pawns. (Note the possiblere-lationship of the thirty-six pieces to the thirty-sixdecanate cards of theTarot.) The game is played byfour players, representing the Four Lesser Anglesofthe Board, thus giving each player one set of five piecesand four pawns. Thefive pieces represent the opera-tion of the Spirit and Four Elemental Rulers—theFivepoints of the Pentagram, the five letters of YHShVH,and the Tarot Ace andCourt Cards. The pawns aretheir servants or vice-gerents. Strictly to be inorder,each of the twenty principal pieces represents a differ-ent God-form,thus:Fire set.Air set.Water set.King—KnephKnight—RaQueen—Sati-AshtorethBishop—ToumCastle—AnoukeKing—SocharisKnight—SebQueen—Knousou PekhtBishop—Shu ZoanCastle—TharpeshestKing—PtahKnight—SebekQueen—ThoueristB i shop—H apimonCastle—Shooeu-tha-ist< 350 >Earth set.King—OsirisKnight—HornsQueen—IsisBishop—ArouerisCastle—Nephthys.However, this tends to confusion, creating in practicefar too complex a game. Itwill be found that four setsof the same five god-forms will suffice. There areonlyfive major god-forms, the others being variations ordifferent aspects ofthose types. These are:Osiris, bearing crook, scourge, Phoenix wand. He isrepresented as sitting on athrone, silent unmoving. Heis the King and represents Spirit, the operation oftheGreat Cross in the Tablets. He corresponds to the Acein Tarot, the root-forceof any element.Horns, a God with Hawk’s head, double mitre, andstanding upright, as though tostride forward. He is theKnight of Enochian Chess and represents the opera-tionof the ten-squared Sephirotic Cross in the FireAngle of any Tablet or Board, andcorresponds to theKing in the Tarot, the figure astride a horse.Isis, an enthroned Goddess with a Throne symbolmounted on the vulturehead-dress. In RosicrucianChess, Isis is the Queen, and represents theoperationof the Sephirotic Cross in the Water Angle of anyTablet. Shecorresponds to the Tarot Queen who isshown seated on a throne.Aroueris, a human shaped God, with a double mitre.He is the Bishop in Enochianchess, and his form is thatof a standing figure, to indicate his swift action.Herepresents the operation of the Sephirotic Cross in theAiry Angle of anyTablet, and represents the Princeor Knight of the Tarot—the figure driving achariot.Nephthys, a Goddess with an Altar or Crescentsymbol above the vulturehead-dress. She is the Castleor Rook of the Chess game. This piece is alwaysrepre-sented as somewhat larger than the others, and is<35i >enclosed within a rectangular frame, within which sheis enthroned. Her office isthe representation of theoperation of the Sephirotic Cross in the Earth Angleofany Tablet, and represents the Princess or Knaveof the Tarot—the Amazon figurewho stands alone.These are the five principal forms used for each ofthe four angles of the Board.Some difference should bemade in the tone of the colouring of the front orfaceof the piece to indicate its angle on the board. Colouredbands may sufficefor this purpose. Moreover the backof the piece—for it is customary to use flatpieces, notround as in ordinary chess—should be painted in theappropriate colourof the element it represents so as toavoid confusion in the recognition of itspower. Thusthe back of the King, as Osiris form, should be paintedwhite torepresent Spirit, and this rule applies to allfour Kings in the four Angles. TheKnight, Horus,should be coloured red. The Queen, Isis, should be blue;theBishop, Aroueris, yellow, and the Castle, Nephthys,should be black and set in alarge frame. Each pieceshould be cut about three inches high.For practical use, these pieces should be mounted onsquare wooden bases, andthose bases painted in differ-ent colours. It will be by the bases that theirplace onthe board may be recognised. For example, there arefour sets of Chesspieces to be set out in the four cornersof the board. Each piece is more or lesslike its corre-sponding piece in some one of the other corners. Thepieces placedin the Air quarter of the board, therefore,will be mounted on yellow bases.Those in the WaterAngle will have blue bases. The pieces in the EarthAngle willhave black bases, and those in the Firequarter will have red bases. Thus, as inthe FourAngelic Tablets, there results a minute sub-division ofthe sub-elementsof the Tablet. There will be an Osirispiece, a King with a white back, on ayellow base, indi-cating that he is a King belonging to the Air Angle.Herepresents the sub-element of Spirit of Air, the mostspiritual and subtle phaseof that element, the Tarot< 352 >Ace of Swords. A King with a blue base indicates hisplace in the Watery Angle. AQueen, an Isis figure witha blue back, set on a red base, shows that she istheQueen of the Fire Angle, representing the WateryAspect of the Firesub-element of any Tablet, the Queenof Wands. A Bishop, yellow backed, mountedon ablack base, shows that he belongs to the Earth Angle,as against a Bishopwith a yellow base whose place isin the Air Angle and who, therefore,corresponds to thePrince of Swords in the Tarot pack. And so for the rest.With but one or two slight exceptions, the piecesmove exactly as do thecorresponding pieces in Chess.The Queen here does not have the full liberty oftheboard as she does normally, nor is she the most power-ful piece on the board.Here she can only move toevery third square. This she can make in anydirection,horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—but only threesquares at anytime. She can leap over interveningsquares, and take pieces on the third squarefromwherever she stands. The other exception is that noCastling is permitted.The Pawns in this Enochian Chess represent theGod-forms of the four sons ofHorus, the Canopic Gods.Their attributions are:Fire. Kabexnuv, mummy-shaped, hawk-headed, theKnight’s pawn.Water. Tmoumathph, mummy-shoped, dog’s head,Queen’s pawn.Air. Ahephi, mummy-shaped, ape-headed, the Bishop’spawn.Earth. Ameshet, mummy-shaped, human-headed, theCastle’s pawn.The same rule for colouring the other pieces appliesto the pawns. Their backsshould be painted in thecolour of the piece they serve. Thus the back oftheKnight’s pawn will be painted the colour of the Knight,red. The base will becoloured according to the LesserAngle in which it is placed. So that in each ofthe FourAngles you will have four pawns on bases in the colour<353 >of its sub-element. The Airy Angle, for example, willhave four pawns mounted onyellow bases. Thosepawns will have four different coloured backs to indi-catethe piece, and therefore the element, which theyrepresent and serve.The pawn moves only one square at a time, and nottwo for the first move as inmodern chess. The rule ofen passant does not apply here, although theregularmethod of taking with pawn, via the diagonal, eitherto right or left,holds equally well.It will be noted that the King has no pawn. Sincehe is Osiris, the other fourpieces and their pawns arehis personal servants and vice-gerents. His placeonthe board is always on the corner of the Lesser Angle,where the correspondingLetters of Tetragrammatonwould be placed on the Angelic Tablets. On thefourcorners of the board as a whole, therefore, will befound the Four Kings.Identical in every way, they yetdiffer in the colour of their bases, the colourof theAngle which they rule. Some variation might be madeas to the posture ofthe God. For instance, the FireKing could be cut as a standing figure, the WaterKingsitting, and so forth. Let it be noted that on the cornersquares, two pieceswill always be found. The King andthe piece corresponding to the Letter of theAnglewill occupy the same square.A piece or pawn threatening, that is giving check, tothe corner square alsochecks the King as well as what-ever other piece happens to be upon that square.In setting up the pieces for play, the rule of Tetra-grammaton on the KerubicSquare of the Tablets, hasapplication. That is, the order in which the lettersofthe Name YHVH are placed on the uppermost squaresof the Servient Squares ofany Lesser Angle, as reflectedfrom the Kerubic Squares above, also govern theplac-ing of the pieces. The Bishop will be placed on the VauSquare, the Queen onthe Heh Square, the Castle onthe Heh final Square, etc. The student whohasthoroughly assimilated the principles involved in the< 354 >attributions of the Enochian Tablets will find all thisperfectlystraightforward, and experience no difficultyherein.With regard to this injunction to set out the pieceson the board following theprime player's setting,whose chessmen are arranged according to the orderofKerubs, note that the remaining three sets of piecesare arranged, on any board,exactly in that order re-gardless of the order of Kerubs in their Angle. Thatisto say, if the prime player chooses an Earth of Watersetting, his pieces willbe set out: King and Castle onthe corner square, then follow the Knight, Queen,andBishop. The other three sets of Air, Water and Firepieces on that board, areset out precisely in that order,either horizontally or vertically as the casemay be.It thus follows that there may result sixteen possiblearrangements of pieces.That is, since there are fourKerubic ranks on each board, and there beingfourseparate boards, the chess-pieces may be arranged onthe board in sixteendifferent settings. The reason forany particular setting—if divination is themotive forplay—must depend on the prme player’s syntheticgrasp of the Orderteaching. Let him remember thatthere are sixteen figures of Geomancy, each withaspecial and specific divinatory value. It should be re-membered that theseGeomantic figures are each underthe influence of a Zodiacal genius and aplanetaryruler. Not only so, but each is attributed to a Hebrewletter, thereforeto a corresponding Tarot Trump, withits allocation to a sign and a constellationin theheavens with all the hierarchical ideas that the latterimplies. Thus theplaying of this game resumes thewhole philosophy of Magic.The prime player must be guided in his selection ofboards not only by choice ofelement as previouslydescribed, but by any one of these sixteen rootsignifi-cations of Geomancy. For each one of these sixteenfigures may be appliedto the sixteen Lesser Angles ofthe Enochian Tablets and chess-boards.

Pinr Ar\\ql<zSETTING OF THE ENOCH IAN CHESS-MENFOLLOWING THE AIR ANGLE OF THE FIRE TABLET(The arrows indicate direction ofplay)angle comes under the operation of a Geomantic rulerand genius, and under thedominion of that portion ofthe starry heavens corresponding to its Tarottrump.The method of attributing the figures to the Angles isidentical with theprocess described for the squares ofboth columns and ranks in the Lesser Angles.Thusthe Airy Lesser Angle of the Air Chess-board would beMutable (Airy) Air,referred to the Zodiacal signGemini, and hence to the Geomantic figure ofAlbus,which is a mercurial figure under the presidency of< 356 >Taphthartharath. The Watery Angle of the Air Tabletwould be Kerubic or Fixed(Watery) Air, which is theSign Aquarius, and the Geomantic figure ofTristitia,attributed also to Saturn, and the ruler over it is Zazel.The EarthyAngles of the Air Tablet, is elemental Air,referred to the Geomantic figure ofFortuna Minor, alsoa solar or Leo figure, ruled by Sorath. The fiery AngleisCardinal Air, the Zodiacal Sign of Libra, and Puellawould be the Geomanticfigure, with a Venusian nature,ruled by KedemeLThe same principle is involved in allocating theGeomantic figures to the otherTablets and angles. Themagical and divinatory value of the Geomantic figuresmusttherefore decide the choice of Chess-boards andLesser Angle settings.The yellow and red men are so placed that theyadvance to the attack of the blackand the blue respec-tively by the columns; while the latter advance by theranks.That is, the Actives are shown as a vertical force,while the Passives are shownas operating horizontally,shewing the Cross of Life, corresponding to theforcesof the Court Cards and the Zodiacal Trumps in theTarot.The central squares of the board contain the 16 signsthat are allotted to eachLesser Angle. And it is onlyfrom these 16 squares that the pieces—except theRookand the King—-develop their full influence or defensiveforce.The Watery and Airy Boards are counterparts ofeach other, so far as thearrangement of the signs, etc.,of the squares are concerned. And the same istrue asregards the Earth and Fire Boards. Every Board hasits uppermost andlowermost ranks of the passive orfemale element; and its two central ranks areof theactive or male element.The most striking difference between the Air andWater, and the Earth and FireBoards is in the factthat in the former the ranks are broken; whereas inthelatter they are not only continuous across each board,< 357 >but they are continuous right across both boards whenin situ. To this is due thegreater balance and evennessseen in the play of the pieces in the lower boards.<3S8>OFFICIAL RITUALThe correct application of the action of themoveable images (representing the motion ofThe Ruling Angels over the Servient Squares)is called The Playe or Rayingof the Chequersof the Tablets.By G. H. Fratre D.D.C.F,Of the Chess King and the Tarot Ace. The move ofthis piece is one square everyway, and answereth tothe action of the Spirit. Wherever it goeth, it com-mencethand initiateth a fresh current, whence it isrepresented by the motion of onlyone square in anydirection and there staying for this purpose beforemovingonward. So that his action is not hurried, butrepresents a balanced movement.Yet in his beginningof action is he at first a mute force, as though throneduponthe water; as in the end of his action he is a lifemanifested and throned uponthe earth. And herein is amystery of the Lord Aeshoori (Osiris) whenenthronedbetween Isis and Nephthys, thus representing the be-ginning and end ofthe action of Him in whom end andbeginning are not, but rather concealment andthenmanifestation. Herein is a great mystery of life, for HisThrones are not inthe two active elements, seeing thatthese latter are his horse and chariot oftransition inthe passage from concealment into manifestation. Thispiece, then,is the symboliser of the action of thepotencies of the crosses on the ServientSquares.Of the Chess Knight, the Tarot King. The move ofthis piece is three squarescornerwise every way (as inordinary chess) and represented the. leaping actionofthe flickering flame. Wherefore also is. he not stoppedin his course by apiece or an intervening square, evenas Fire seizing on a matter speedilyrendereth it trans-< 359 >parent. This piece representeth the action of Fire as theRevealer of theStrength of the Spirit, even as Hoor isthe avenger of Aeshoori. It is a forcepotent and ter-rible, the King in the elemental operations.Thus it openeth the locked doors of matter andsheweth forth the treasure hiddentherein. Thereforehath all life its beginnnigs in a Fire Celestial. Andthenumber of squares covered by the move of the Knightin the midst of the Board(reckoning from the Squareon which he standeth, but not including it) is16squares, of which 8 are checked, and 8 are passed over.Of the Chess Queen, The Tarot Queen. The move ofthis piece is unto every thirdsquare from her (reckon-ing the square whereon she standeth as the first) aswellcornerwise, as well perpendicular, as horizontal.Thus again covering 16 squaresout of a square of 25squares, of which 8 are threatened, and 8 are passedover.But she threateneth not a piece upon the inter-vening square of her move. Andher movement is asthat of the waves of the sea, and (like the Knight)she is nothindered in her motion by a piece on anintervening square. This piecerepresenteth the un-dulating action of water and of the sea, and she isascribedunto the Great Goddess Isis, who is theCherisher of Life.The Chess Bishop or Fool, the Tarot Prince. Themove of this piece is any numberof squares cornerwise(that is only on the diagonal) in any direction evenuntothe limits of the Tablet. He representeth the keenand swift wind, and he isascribed unto the GodAroueris. He is stopped by any piece in his way, evenas thewind is stopped by a material barrier. He repre-senteth the swift vehicle of theSpirit.The Chess Castle or Rook, the Tarot Princess orKnave. The move of this piecerepresenteth the pon-derous and formidable force of earth and its motion isanynumber of squares in a square direction, perpen-dicular or horizontal (but notcornerwise) even untothe limits of the board.< 360 >It is ascribed unto Nephthys the Goddess. It repre-senteth the completed actionof the Spirit in matter.Therefore is its movement square, and also stoppedbyintervening pieces, yet powerful from the length andbreadth of its range.The Pawns. The four pawns represent certain forcesformed by the conjunction ofthe Spirit with each ofthe four elements severally, and they areseverallyascribed unto Ameshet, Ahephi, Tmoumathph, andKabexnuv, who standbefore the face of Aeshoori. Andtheir movement is but one square forward,perpen-dicular, and they threaten one square forward diagonalon each side, thusformulating the symbol of the Tri-angle, for they each represent a mixture ofthree ele-ments under the presidency of the Spirit.Therefore,eachis, as it werethe servant of the God or Goddess, beforewhom he standeth. Yet, they be all, ina manner, alikein their action, although their Lords be different. Eachis theservant of the God or Goddess whose elementis expressed in his symbol, withoutits contrary.In each set of three elements, taken together, twomust be contrary. Wherefore,for example, Ameshet,who represents Water, Fire, and Earth, is the servantofNephthys, whose element Earth is expressed in hisattribution without thecontrary of Air.Ahephi, who represents Air, Fire, and Water, is theservant of Aroueris, whoseattribution is Air.Tmoumathph, who represents Water, Air, and Earth,is the Servant of Isis, whoseattribution is Water.Kabexnuv, who represents Fire, Air, and Earth, isthe servant of Horus, whoseattribution is Fire.One of the rules concerning the Pawns in actual playis that should one reach the8th square of its column,it may be exchanged for the piece of which it isvice-gerent. That is, as in ordinary chess, a pawn whichreaches the eighthsquare may be exchanged for anypiece the player desires—but in Enochian chesstheexchange is limited by the elemental attributions of< 361 >the pieces. So that were an Ahephi pawn the servant ofAroueris, to survive thebattle of the entire game andwin through to the top of the board, it could beex-changed for a Bishop, even though the Bishop wereuntaken and still on theboard. And so with the others.The opening of chess play is known under thetechnical title of “Awakening theAbodes.” As alreadystated the game is set for four players, each of whomworksthe pieces at each of the four angles, playing inrotation. Should the game beused for the purposes ofdivination, the first player would be the querent,theone asking the question, or the person representing thematter about whichinformation is required. This firstplayer chooses which angle of the board hewill playfrom, bearing in mind the divinatory qualities of theelements as setforth in the documents on Geomancyand Tarot.The major difference between Enochian chess andthe modern game is that in theformer, when using itfor divinatory purposes, the moves are decided bythethrowing of a dice. Depending upon the number dis-closed by the dice, so musta certain piece be moved,for the numbers are attributed to pieces. Theactualdetails of the move—that is whether to right or left,backward or forward,to take an opponent or to pressforward—are quite obviously left to the personalin-genium and divining mind of the player. The dice onlydetermines specificallythat such and such a piece shallbe played.The Prime Mover, or the owner of the Ptah piece,plays first, and his first moveis to be decided by thethrow of the dice to indicate which piece or pawn hemustfirst play. Each player follows in rotation, deosil,that is round the board withthe sun from the primeplayer. First the prime player moves, and if his settingisAir, then follow the Water pieces, the Fire pieces,the Earth pieces, and thenback again to the Air who isthe prime mover.< 362 >The actual attributions of the numbers on the dice tothe Enochian chess-piecesare as follows:If the player throws:1. He moves a King or any Pawn.2. He moves a Knight.3. He moves a Bishop.4. He moves a Queen.5. He moves a Castle.6. He moves a Pawn.At the first move of the game, if the dice cast throwsup 1, it clearly cannotapply to the King, for this piececannot move at all until the pawns have beenclearedbefore him. In that event, a pawn would require to bemoved.The reason for the attribution of the numbers on thedice above shown to thechess-pieces are fairly simple.The explanation must be sought in the numbersandpowers of the squares on the Sephirotic crosses. On theten-squared cross,Kether, the Crown, is the firstsquare, which is a fairly sound attribution tothe King,who is Osirir, Spirit—the Number 1. Number 2 on theCross is Chokmah,the Yod of Tetragrammaton, Abba,and therefore the Knight is appropriate. 3 isBinah,to which is referred in the Enochian attributions, theHigh Priestess cardof the Tarot. The mitre of the HighPriestess determines the selection of theBishop. 4 isChesed, to which is attributed the Tarot trump TheEmpress, who isthe chess Queen. And 5 is the Castle,referred to Geburah, and the Tarot card TheTowerstruck by lightning. The remaining number 6 refersto the movement of anypawn, one square.It is not always necessary to use four players. Twoindividuals may play, eachoperating two lesser anglesand two sets of pieces. Fire and Air would bepittedagainst Water and Earth. If this is done, then the twosets of elementalpieces of any player must be regardedas a single unit in practice. That is tosay if the firstplayer whose pieces are the allies of Fire and Air, checkstheEarth King, the second player must not continue< 363 >the movements of the Water pieces, which are his allies,until he has moved theEarth King out of check byany of the usual technical forms of chess. Thereaderwho understands and appreciates ordinary chessmanouevring will appreciatewhat is expected of himin the course of play.When the so-called “stale-mate” occurs, which iswhen a player has no piece orpawn that he can movewithout incurring check, that is the King not being incheckbut so placed that he could not move withoutgetting in to check, the result isthat the player whoseKing is affected loses his turn until his state of“stale-mate” is removed.For the purposes of Divination, an additional piecewas employed. This was calledthe Ptah. Any bookdealing with the Egyptian God-forms will describe theform inquestion. A small figure of this should be made,and on the board it willrepresent the question ormatter of divination. The mode of employing itissimple. It has no power at all, and is not actually usedin the play. It isonly used by the first player to be seton any square in the Lesser Angle fromwhich he beginshis play. Any square, that is, except the one on whichthe Kingfirst stands. The King must reach, in thecourse of the game, this square onwhich the Ptah isset and remain there for one round of the gameun-disturbed—that is without moving therefrom—and un-checked. A knowledge of thenature of the Pyramidswith their elemental composition, and some knowledgeof theAngelic forces represented by those squares andPyramids, will decide the playeras to what square shallbe selected for the placing of the Ptah. If thedivinatoryquestion concerns the fiery Lesser Angle of the Elementof Earth, aquestion involving Capricornus and thefigure Career ruled by Zazel, then thePtah probablyshould be placed upon a square of the Angle which isof the natureof Cardinal Earth, as representing theYod type of Earth, or on Elemental Fire,that is the< 364 >Heh (final) type of Fire. The ingenium of the inter-ested student will guide hisjudgment herein.NOTES CONCERNING THE BOARDS ANDTHE PLAY GENERALLYEvery Lesser Angle throughout the Tablets has adiagonal line of four squaresstarting from its primesquare; which are allotted respectively to Aries,Gemini,Scorpio and Earth. From these four squaresthe Bishops can move one square into asquare of Libra,Sagittarius, Taurus or Water, these completing theseries ofsquares in that Lesser Angle in which a Bishopcan move. Let us call this theAries System of diagonalsquares.This diagonal is crossed by another which in theAiry and Watery boards iscomposed of Cancer, Leo,Virgo and Air Squares, having as subsidiaries, squaresofAquarius, Pisces, Capricorn and Fire. In the Earthyand Fiery board the secondseries of four form thediagonal, and the first the subsidiaries. Let us callthisthe Cancer series.If we now examine the Boards we shall see that theAries system of any LesserAngle is joined diagonallyto the Aries system of the other three LesserAngles;and that the Cancer also is similarly joined to everyother Cancer system.So that we have two systems ofsquares; viz: the Aries and the Cancer; of thewhole,each containing four squares allotted to every sign itcontains. Thisresembles the black and white systems ofsquares of the ordinary board; and it isas if we allottedthe White to Aries, and the Black to Cancer.When beginning a game see to which system thePtah square belongs. Because if itbe a square of theAries system the attack of the opposing Queens isin-significant, while that of the Bishops is strong. In sucha case the number ofpieces is 6; 2 Bishops, 2 Kinghtsand 2 Rooks. That is, in these matters the Airyattackis strong, and the Watery weak.< 365 >If the Ptah be on a square of the Cancer System,one opposing Queen directlyattacks this Square, butthe Bishops do not. In this case the number ofattack-ing pieces is 5; one Queen, 2 Knights, and 2 Rooks.That is, in thesematters the Airy attack is insignifi-cant, while the Watery is strong.If an opposing Queen can attack the Ptah, the de-fence should note well whichQueen it is and shouldremember that this fact greatly enhances her power.Heshould thereupon not hesitate to exchange whatmight otherwise be considered amore powerful piecefor her. She should certainly be exchanged for a Bishop,andprobably also for a Knight.The YHVH order of the pieces corresponds withtheir respective offensive anddefensive Powers.Yod. Knight. The most offensive piece.Heh, Queen. More offensive than defensive.Vau. Bishop. More defensive than offensive.Heh (final). Rook. Most defensive. That is in ageneral sense.Because, according to the circumstances of the actualplay, every piece is ableto assume both roles of attack-ing or defending.Note that, as in ordinary chess, opposing Kings maynot occupy contiguoussquares. There must always beone square between them. This, however, doesnotapply to the Kings who are allies. That is, if Fire andAir are allies, thenthe Kings of these elements mayapproach each other and occupy contiguoussquares.Naturally they do not check each other.When a King has once been moved from the cornersquare which he occupied withanother piece at thebeginning of the game neither he nor that piece can bemovedback again to that square unless it be vacant.If the Prime Player’s King is checked and he cannotmove it, his game is arrestedand his pieces cannot moveuntil the pieces of his ally can release his King.Thatis to say that his pieces remain in situ but having duringthat time of checkno power of action and can neither< 366 >attack nor threaten; they only block the squares oc-cupied. If the allied Kingcan be check-mated, hispartner continues to play and to seek to release him.Whenboth Kings are checkmated, the game is at anend, and the partners checkmatedhave lost the game.The game is also lost by the first player, when thoughneitherhe or his ally is checkmated, the enemies holdsuch a position that the PrimePlayer cannot possiblyattain the Ptah square.The Knights or Fiery forces of the Elements meetand clash violently in allparts, and are strong in attackagainst every thing and everywhere. Their moves,likeFire, pass unarrested through the other elements in ir-regular courses likethe lambent flame, leaping bothdiagonally and square-wise at every move. Theycon-tain the potential forces of the other pieces. Their forceis similar to theTarot King, and to Chokmah. Theyare the Abba forces, and with the Queensrepresent theBriatic forces of the scheme.The Queens or Watery forces of the Elements neverclash with one another, butever undulate onwards,each in its own course unaffected by opposing or cross-ingwaves. But the Watery forces only move in theirrespective pre-ordained courses;they cannot leavetheir limits and enter upon the domain of others. Water,likeFire, is unarrested and undulating, and like Airand Earth it can act diagonallyor square-wise, con-taining the potential force of Air and Earth. They aretheQueen of the Tarot, and Binah. They are theAimah, and are of Briah.The Bishops are subtle and sharp, Airy in quality,moving rapidly, but easilyarrested in their course.They clash not with opposing Bishops, and thefriendlyAirs support each other in attack and defence. Wherethe active Airswhirl the passives cannot come. Theyare the forces of the Princes, and ofYetzirah, the Son.The Rooks are the heavy resisting powers of thePrincess, the Earth by nature,mighty indeed in actionwhen preceded by the action of the other three. That is,< 367 >when in any matter the forces of Fire, Water, and Airhave been absorbed andequilibriated, i.e. removedfrom the board, the mighty powers of the castlescomeinto play. But woe to him who too early calls theseponderous forces forth.The Rook moves through columns as through ranks.She is able, therefore, to reachevery square on theboard, and is very powerful. But her movement isveryponderous, and it is a piece that is not moved manytimes in a game unlessthe forces of the other Elementshave been absorbed in its working out. WhiletheAleph, Mem, and Shin, forces are in full operation theRook is easily attackedand with difficulty defended,unless she remain quiet, and act as a firm basisofsupport and defence to the side. If she, however, makethe mistake of enteringearly into action she is nearlysure to fall a prey to the more subtle forceswhoseproper sphere is attacked.If the more subtle forces do not bring about a solu-tion of the question, andthe matter has to be foughtout to the bitter end, that is, if the YetziraticandBriatic forces are absorbed and balanced in the matter,then do the ponderousforces of Assiah, the Princess,engage in powerful combat.End of Volume FourCompleting the Work< 368 >"}]
