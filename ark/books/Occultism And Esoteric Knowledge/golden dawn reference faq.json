Frequently-Asked Questions (FAQ) +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- +-+-+ 1. What is the Golden Dawn? The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is an initiatory society devoted to spiritual, philosophical, and magical development. To quote its \"history lecture,\" (from I. Regardie's book, _The_Golden_Dawn_), \"The Order of the G.D. [Golden Dawn] is an Hermetic Society whose members are taught the principles of Occult Science and the Magic of Hermes.\" Started in London in 1887 by three British Freemasons, Dr. William Robert Woodman, Dr. William Wynn Westcott, and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, the first Temple of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with the title \"Isis-Urania,\" began to admit Fratres and Sorores in 1888. For the next two decades, they generated a body of esoteric knowledge unparalleled to this day. Traditions as seemingly different as Chaos Magick and Gard- nerian Wicca have roots in the Golden Dawn, and it has influenced scholars (e.g., A. E. Waite) and poets (e.g., W. B. Yeats) alike. The Golden Dawn \"system of magic\" is a tool designed to educate the student of the esoteric in both practical matters of ritual and divination, and in abstract metaphysical ideas. The focus of the Golden Dawn material is primarily Western -- i.e. Judeo-Christian, Greek, and Egyptian -- but some Eastern ideas have crept in over the years. It is a \"hierarchical\" or"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"matricular\" system, in that certain information is reserved for students who have passed beyond a certain point in their occult education. The system of grades is as follows (along with their correspondences with the classical elements, the seven ancient planets, and the ten sephiroth of the Jewish Kabbalah), with the student beginning at the top: NAME ELEMENT PLANET SEPHIRA 0=0 Neophyte --- --- --- 1=10 Zelator Earth --- Malkuth, Kingdom 2=9 Theoricus Air Moon Yesod, Foundation 3=8 Practicus Water Mercury Hod, Splendour 4=7 Philosophus Fire Venus Netzach, Victory 5=6 Adeptus Minor Spirit Sun Tiphareth, Beauty 6=5 Adeptus Major --- Mars Gevurah, Might 7=4 Adeptus Exemptus --- Jupiter Chesed, Mercy 8=3 Magister Templi --- Saturn Binah, Understanding 9=2 Magus --- --- Chokmah, Wisdom 10=1 Ipsissimus --- --- Kether, Crown The grades of Neophyte through Philosophus comprise the First, or Outer Order. A grade called the \"Portal\" comes between 4=7 and 5=6, and this contains some very powerful symbolism on the transition between the Outer and Inner \"Mysteries.\" The three Adept grades comprise the Second, or Inner Order (Roseae Rubae et Aureae Crucis), and are normally only open to those who pass rigorous examinations and are chosen on other qualifications. The final three grades (which refer to the \"Supernal\" sephiroth) comprise the Third, or Hidden Order of Masters. There is considerable disagreement among Order sources as to whether living human beings can attain these final mystical grades (not unlike the Bodhisattvas of Buddhism, it seems). Please note that the above is just a brief summary, and that many details have been omitted for the sake of clarity. For more information, see just about any of the books listed in the Reference section (IV), or email me at the address listed at the beginning of this FAQ. +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- +-+-+ 2. Is the Golden Dawn a religion? Definitely not. Although religious and metaphysical concepts are the focus of much Order work, \"there is nothing contrary to your civil, moral, or religious duties\" (to quote the Neophyte initiation ceremony) in any oaths or Order matters. This is a landmark that seems to have been passed down from Freemasonry, one of the primary sources of Golden Dawn material. However, an overall notion of religious tolerance pervades the Golden Dawn, for one is also reminded (in the same ceremony), to \"Remember that you hold all Religions in reverence, for there is none but contains a Ray from the Ineffable Light that you are seeking.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"For those who would decry all things \"occult\" as Satanic and/or pagan, know that the higher degrees of the Golden Dawn seem to grow more and more Christian in character as one climbs the hierarchy of grades. The influence of the Rosicrucians, a mystical/mythical Christian organization dating from the 17th Century, is strong indeed (see Question 5). For those who shy away from the often-overbearing aegis of Christendom, don't despair, as there is enough symbolism present in Order rituals and teachings to satisfy nearly any taste. Jewish Kabbalah, Islam, the Egyptian and Greek Mysteries, and even the Celtic mythos, have all been integrated into Golden Dawn work at one time or another. +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- +-+-+ 3. Is the hierarchy of grades merely a ruse to empower the \"enlightened?\" Well, even Magical Orders are made up of human beings, and some inevitably take advantage of the \"faithful.\" This can come in many guises: expensive dues for a trickle of information, out-and-out lies about magical powers or ancient sources, forced therapy before advancement, uncomfortable initiations, or expulsion if one holds a differing viewpoint. As always, place your _caveat_ firmly in your _emptor_ before taking any action. However, the concept of the hierarchy of grades has its definite merits. First of all, consider the parallels with education in general. One must first learn ones' alphabet before learning to read; and learn to read before understanding _Tom_Sawyer_, let alone _Finnegan's_Wake_. Also, training in magic necessarily involves an exploration of different modes and areas of ones' own consciousness, the experiencing of which can very well be jolting, frightening, or life-threatening. Some aspects of the psyche are best left unexplored until one develops the tools and stamina necessary for the journey. The issue of secrecy is an F.A.I. (Frequently Argued Issue) on the Usenet news group alt.magick, and for the most part, most of the original Golden Dawn \"secrets\" have already been (or are in the process of being) published. However, it still comes up often enough to address a few points. Why keep certain things secret, you may ask? Well... (a) It is worth it *not* to have everything handed to you all at once."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Whether it is working out physics problems, or reading an Agatha Christie mystery novel, skipping to the end for the \"answers\" takes something away from the experience. (b) Many posit the existence of a \"Group Mind\" which can develop in some seriously-minded associations of individuals. \"Secrecy\" here is just an outgrowth of simple privacy, committment, and integrity among a closely-knit group of people, who don't want their business known by the entire world. (c) One must differentiate between information and knowledge. There is a huge difference between the basic facts of a craft (which can be and are set down in books) and the actual skills that people develop from accumulated experience (which usually cannot even be expressed in concise words, let alone written down). I think many would agree, to use Colin Low's analogy, that a \"Do It Yourself Brain Surgery\" book would be a bad idea. The knowledge isn't really a *secret*, but it's certainly not available for everyone's immediate use, either. (d) Finally, there is the simple fact that there are probably plenty of narrow-minded people out there who would seek to persecute \"those strange Golden Dawners\" if they happened upon, and misunderstood, some tidbit of information taken out of context. All things considered, however, secrecy is something which should certainly be left up to each individual. To quote alt.magick's resident terminator, Tyagi Nagasiva (Tyagi@HouseOfKaos.Abyss.com), \"There are very many good reasons for secrecy, and very few for requiring it.\" +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- +-+-+ 4. Are Golden Dawn Temples still active? How can I become a member? Yes, there are Temples still thriving, from the U.S.A. to New Zealand. See Part III, List of Active Golden Dawn Temples and Related Organizations, below. Becoming a member of a magical order, however, is something that should not be taken lightly. I wish I could reprint Donald Michael Kraig's article \"So you want to join a Magical Order...\" from _The_Llewellyn_New_Times_ (May-June 1992, no. 923), which lays out many of the pros and cons. A few things to note, however: (a) Don't count on having \"secrets\" revealed to you. Ninety-nine percent of them are already published, in some form, somewhere. (b) The symbols and metaphors used by a particular group or tradition may not \"work\" for you. Even different \"Golden Dawn\" groups vary in"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"their focus or underlying worldview, and many have altered or expanded upon the original (19th century) G.D. material. Don't confuse the map -- the association of individuals -- with the territory -- the system of symbol and ritual. (c) Listen to your common sense! If something doesn't feel right to you, by all means don't do it. Not everyone seems meant to work within an Order -- possibly you can do better, and create something new! +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- +-+-+ 5. How is the Golden Dawn connected with the Rosicrucians? The Order itself claims a descent (in spirit if not a direct lineage) with the Rosicrucians, a mystic Christian organization that may, or may not have \"existed\" in the strictest sense of the word. A short history of Rosicrucianism in in order. In about the year 1610, an anonymous document entitled \"Fama Fraternitatis of the Meritorious Order of the Rosy Cross\" was distributed among German occultists, and was printed at Cassel in 1614. It describes the founding of a secret order of enlightened learning in the Hermetic and Christian mysteries. The (mythical) life story of the founder, C.R.C. (Christian Rosenkreutz) is related, as well as the discovery of his wondrous tomb centuries later. A second manifesto, \"Confessio Fraternitatis\" (1615), describes the Rosicrucian Order in more detail, and firmly takes sides against the Papacy. A third document, \"The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz,\" is an interesting alchemical fantasy, probably written by Lutheran pastor Johann Valentine Andreae in his impetuous youth, but with little to do with the previous documents. The publication of these documents met an eager public, and many pub- lished their scholarly and religious \"credentials\" hoping to get noticed and chosen for membership. After about twenty years, however, this fervor seemingly died down. It wasn't until the late 1600's and early 1700's that hints of Rosicrucianism began to reappear, and the Rosicru- cian egregore seemed to find a home in Freemasonry. From England to Russia, Masonic/Rosicrucian groups flourished in the late 1700's, and the most well-known were the Gold- und Rosen-kreutzers in Germany. Again, however, this activity seemed to fade into the background until the late 1800's, with the popular revival of esotericism and the occult in England. The Masonic _Societas_Rosicruciana_ described below (Part II) was the immediate precursor of the Golden Dawn, but no known direct connection is known with the original 17th Century Rosicrucians. In the 20th Century, there has been a virtual explosion of groups claiming the Rosicrucian mantle, and it is quite wisely that the Adeptus Minor of the G.D. is warned to be wary of \"strangers\" claiming to be members of the Rosicrucian Order. Of particular note is the San Jose, California based group A.M.O.R.C. (Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis), which, despite their claims of ancient lineage, were a relatively recent devel- opment. Also, despite a very nice museum and bookstore, they seem to"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"have little else to offer that cannot be found elsewhere. This author agrees with Paul Foster Case's assessment that the \"True and Invisible\" Rosicrucian Order is a shared \"state of mind,\" not an actual organized society. Thus, any historical links between Rosicrucianism and the Golden Dawn seem to be much less important than the fact that many members of the G.D. have been and are in touch with the \"soul\" or egregore of the Rosy Cross. Ex Deo nascimur, in Jesu morimur, per Spiritum Sanctum reviviscimus. +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- +-+-+ 6. Who was Israel Regardie? Dr. Francis Israel Regardie (17 Nov 1907 - 1985, motto \"Ad Maiorem Adonai Gloriam,\" or \"To the greatness of the Lord\") was a relative latecomer in the Golden Dawn, joining Felkin's Hermes Temple of the Stella Matutina in about 1934. He is most infamously known for publishing _The_Golden_Dawn_ a few years later, thereby breaking his oath of secrecy. Every Order ritual, from 0=0 to 5=6, was included, along with many of the original \"knowledge lectures\" and \"flying rolls\" (instructional manuscripts) written by Mathers and Westcott. Although initially spurned by his G.D. peers, lately Regardie has been seemingly vindicated. The publishing of the Order material in a relatively complete form has certainly kept the Golden Dawn from being lost to the mists of time. Many of the modern G.D. Orders claim an \"apostolic suc- cession\" through Regardie, so it seems he has been sufficiently forgiven. During the last few years of his life, he \"authorized\" a few different groups to carry on his work, but it seems that some of these groups have taken to claiming \"bigger pieces of the pie\" when it comes to authority and lineage. Recently, Regardie's role in the propagation of Golden Dawn documents has been called into question. Bill Heidrick (bheidrick@aol.com), the Grand Treasurer General of the O.T.O., wrote on April 14, 1994: \"Regardie's _Golden_Dawn_ was a joint enterprise between Israel Regardie and Gerald Yorke. Yorke supplied the materials, as Francis (I.Regardie) told me himself. Yorke had warning from his family as far back as the days of Equinox Vol.I never to allow publicity of his connections with either Crowley or the Golden Dawn. This is not surprising in that the family was and is not very far removed from the succession to the British throne. When _G.D._ was to be published this ban was serious enough for Gerald to act as a silent partner and unannounced co-author with Francis. Toward the end of his life Gerald did relax his privacy a little, to the extent of taking an occasional \"bow\" in print"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" and supporting Ellic Howe with an intro to _The_Magicians_of_the_ _Golden_Dawn_. The largest public collection of Golden Dawn and Crowley MSS is the Yorke collection in the Warburg Institute at the University of London. That is Gerald's collection, fortified with materials provided by Karl Germer.\" Yorke's contribution to Regardie's later book _The_Complete_Golden_Dawn_ _System_of_Magic_ seems evident, but it is difficult to assess his impact on the earlier published materials. Regardie certainly experienced the initiation ceremonies up to 5=6 at the Hermes Temple, and went through a certain amount of angst at breaking his oaths for the greater good. Some claim that Regardie, later in life, attained the higher degrees of 6=5 and 7=4, and was glad to finally receive true initiation (contrasted to the ceremonies of the \"Inepti\" at Hermes Temple). Harvey Newstrom (hnewstrom@hnewstrom.ess.harris.com), a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn that Regardie sponsored in the 1980's, wrote on April 18, 1994: \"Regardie was given a certificate of 6=5 after visiting New Zealand. This was an honorary degree that was intended to show respect and affirmation of Regardie's work. Regardie was not a member of the New Zealand branch of the G:.D:., he did not study from them, he did not undergo examination from them nor did he demonstrate the completion of the requisites for that level. Most importantly, Regardie still maintained the title, signatures, magical insignia, and other ensigns of office as appropriate for his actual level. He never upgraded his own assesment to claim any higher degrees. After Regardie's death, the New Zealand group also sent a 7=4 certificate filled out for Regardie. Dated after his death, this certificate certainly was an honorary one.\" Patrick Zalewski, in _Secret_Inner_Order_Rituals_of_the_G.D._, claims that Regardie \"...participated in a 6=5 ceremony as one of the Temple Officers\" during his visit to new Zealand in August 1983, but the issue of his initiatory status is left unclear. +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- +-+-+ 7. What connection did Aleister Crowley have with the Golden Dawn? Edward Alexander (Aleister) Crowley (1875-1947) joined the Isis-Urania Temple of the G.D. in November of 1898, and quickly advanced to the grade of Adeptus Minor by January of 1900. Crowley grew distasteful of the pretentious dealings between many of the members, and of the fact that many were initiated for no other reason than their \"worldly prosperity.\" I quote from his \"history lection\" (with the line numbers removed for readability) from Liber LXI vel Causae A.'.A.'. : \"In 1900 one P., a brother, [Crowley, \"Perdurabo\"] instituted a rigorous test of S.R.M.D. [Mathers] on the one side and the Order on the other. He discovered that S.R.M.D., though a scholar of some ability and a magician of remarkable powers, had never attained"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" complete initiation: and further had fallen from his original place, he having imprudently attracted to himself forces of evil too great and terrible for him to withstand. The claim of the Order that the true adepts were in charge of it was definitely disproved. In the Order, with two certain exceptions and two doubtful ones, he found no persons prepared for initiation of any sort. He thereupon by his subtle wisdom destroyed both the Order and its chief.\" While the last statements certainly aren't true (both the G.D. and Mathers long surviving Crowley's defection), it certainly sheds light on the \"birth\" of the Golden Dawn's first \"pseudo-messiah,\" as Gerald Yorke termed Crowley. Crowley's subsequent magical work, too lengthy to describe completely here, was a unique and singular accomplishment. His reception of _Liber_ _AL_vel_Legis_ in Cairo in 1904 marked the beginning of a \"new aeon\" of the world, and of the religion/philosophy of Thelema. The details of ritual and magical doctrine that Crowley continued to propagate, however, were intimately connected with his beginnings in the Golden Dawn. The two primary esoteric Orders which Crowley either created or placed his unique imprint upon are the A.A. and the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis). The A.A., which some claim stands for \"Astron Argon,\" \"Aster Argos,\" or \"Argentum Astrum\" (Greek and Latin for \"Silver Star\"), was Crowley's idea of the ideal and individualized initiatory regimen. Most lineages (which usually are passed down on a one-on-one basis) follow the Golden Dawn- like grade system and magical/mystical \"curriculum\" set down in Crowley's \"One Star in Sight,\" which is in _Magick_in_Theory_and_Practice_. Also, the recently-published _Mystical_and_Magical_System_of_the_A.'.A.'._, by James Eshelman, is a good source of information on this subject (see the Reference List, Part IV, below). The O.T.O. was founded in 1895 by Karl Kellner as a concretization of various Masonic rites, and also as a vehicle for the teaching of tantric- based sexual magic. In 1922, Crowley took over as Outer Head of the Order (OHO), and modified its focus to conform to his \"new aeon\" Thelemic revel- ations. Although still an initiatory organization, the O.T.O. is concerned mainly with the social, economic, and interactive aspects of magic and Thelema, rather than on presenting an individualized system of spirituality (as is the regime of the A.A.). The O.T.O. today is at its largest size ever, with over 2000 members, and many of the active North American G.D. groups listed"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"below have some kind of connection with the O.T.O.. Crowley's _Equinox_, especially the recently-written Volume III, Number 10, is a good reference for the O.T.O.. ======================================================================== === The following is PART 2/3 of the Golden Dawn FAQ. +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- +-+-+ 8. How do I get started? First, there exist various other \"getting started\" documents on magic and esoteric spirituality posted to the Usenet newsgroups alt.magick, alt.pagan, alt.meditation (?), and others, as well as on many Internet FTP and WWW sites. Since the suggestions below come from a Golden Dawn point of view, these other more general documents may also be of interest. Prior to the publication of most of the Golden Dawn material, the only real way to \"get started\" was by petitioning an active Temple, being accepted, and going through the Neophyte (0=0) initiation ceremony. While this is still an option, easy access to the bulk of the Golden Dawn material has opened up other, more solitary avenues of approach. What follow are two basic techniques (one meditative, one ceremonial) that have helped many to begin on the road to their \"Great Work.\" (A) The Neophyte Meditation This exercise in concentration and stilling the mind contains two general components -- breathing and visualization -- but some helpful hints about relaxation and concentration might be in order first. Make yourself comfortable (sit or lay down) and try to relax the body. Starting at the feet, clench and release various muscles, and work up the body to the head and face. Think of your warm blood coursing through your body, enriching each part as it relaxes. If you fall asleep, that's fine, but you may want to find a better time of day to do this. Breathe from the abdomen, not the chest. (i) Rhythmic Breathing: The \"fourfold breath\" is suggested for beginners: * inhale fully, while counting 1-2-3-4 * hold the breath, while counting 1-2-3-4 * exhale fully, while counting 1-2-3-4 * hold the breath, while counting 1-2-3-4 (i) Visualization: From the First Knowledge Lecture (cf. Regardie's _Golden_Dawn_), \"Let the Neophyte consider a point as defined in mathematics -- having position, but no magnitude -- and let him note the ideas to which this gives rise. Concentrating his faculties on this, as a focus, let him endeavor to realise the *Immanance* of the *Divine* throughout *Nature*, in all her aspects.\" This \"primitive point\" (in Hebrew, NQVDH RAShVNH) can be fruitfully"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" compared to the initial point of the creation of the universe, as is described in the _Zohar:_The_Book_of_Enlightenment_ (translated below by Daniel Chanan Matt, NY: Paulist Press, 1983): \"A blinding spark flashed within the Concealed of the Concealed from the mystery of the Infinite, a cluster of vapor in formlessness, ... Deep within the spark gushed a flow imbuing colors below, concealed within the concealed of the mystery of the Infinite. The flow broke through and did not break through its aura. It was not known at all until, under the impact of breaking through, one high and hidden point shone. Beyond that point, nothing is known. So it is called Beginning, the first command of all.\" A comparison can also be made to various modern scientific theories of the \"Big Bang,\" which is thought to have occurred within an infinitesimally small point which encompassed all of the present- day universe. (B) The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram The ritual act of \"banishing\" stems from an old notion that magic must be performed in a purified environment, and that \"evil spirits\" (or undesired \"unconscious thought forms\") must first be told to vacate the premises. A more recent interpretation is that of de- lineating a \"sacred space\" at the beginning of a ritual, apart from the mundane world. The focus is often on a military-like attention to detail, which constructs this impregnable \"circle\" around the magician. The following banishing ritual was given to Neophytes of the Golden Dawn, to get them prepared and accustomed to dealing with spiritual entities. It is also an often-used component at the beginning and end of many rituals. First, perform the Qabalistic Cross: Face East, and take a steel dagger in your right hand. Touch your forehead , and say . . . ATEH (Thou art) Touch your breast , and say . . . MALKUTH (the kingdom) Touch your right shoulder, and say . . . Ve-GEBURAH (and the power) Touch your left shoulder, and say . . . Ve-GEDULAH (and the glory) Clasp your left hand over your right hand hand before you, and say . . . . . . . . Le-OLAM (for ever) Turn the dagger upwards, and say . . . . AMEN"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Next, begin to slowly rotate clockwise (\"deosil,\" with the sun), prepared to trace a Circle around yourself with the dagger. First, while facing the East, trace a \"banishing pentagram of Earth,\" in the order 123451:  2  4 5  1 3 and \"vibrate\" the Hebrew God-name IHVH. Rotate clockwise, and face South. Trace the pentagram, and vibrate ADNI. Rotate clockwise, and face West. Trace the pentagram, and vibrate AHIH. Rotate clockwise, and face North. Trace the pentagram, and vibrate AGLA. Rotate clockwise, and come back around to the East. Upon completing the Circle, form a Great Cross (feet together, arms extended horizontally with with palms forward), close your eyes, and recite the archangelic powers stationed about the Circle: \"Before me, Raphael Behind me, Gabriel At my right hand, Michael At my left hand, Auriel. Before me flames the Pentagram -- Behind me shines the Six-Rayed Star.\" Follow with the Qabalistic Cross again, and you're finished. An interesting analysis and interpretation of this ritual, along with some personal commentary as to its potential, is given below: ---------------------------BEGIN- QUOTATION------------------------------- From: markk@cypress.West.Sun.COM (Mark Kampe) Subject: a lesser banishing Newsgroups: alt.magick Date: 31 Oct 1994 16:45:34 GMT The words are widely known, but it occurred to me that I've never seen a discussion of the melody and harmonies that give them meaning. Surely, like the Tao, \"the tune that can be told is not the true tune\". None, the less, I thought I would try to describe some of the experiences that have accompanied some of my attempts at a LBRP. P.S. ... For those who know the words, please sing along, and tell me how the tune works for you. For those who have your own tunes, would you consider trying to share one? For those who don't haven't tried the song,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" this may not make much sense at all. 0. I begin with receptive silence, first bringing the room into order, then bringing my body into repose, then my breathing into measured rhythm, and finally my thoughts. I cannot begin this work until I have ceased doing other things. 1. Using my father's dagger I trace the circle, and the cross, addressing myself to the ritual. It seems a bit like an introduction (to the One \"who needs no introduction\" :-). The real purpose, however, is to remind me where I am, and why I have come here ... and it does that pretty effectively. Establishing my relationship to the power is indeed an important preliminary to the remainder of the ritual. 2. Facing the rising sun, I inhale and look for the word that brought about the creation. I gaze through the letters that symbolize the ne-plus-ultra and try to find the sound that they represent. This is the word I need to trigger my own creation today. When the Yod becomes clear, I am the Heh that receives it, and the Vau they become wells within me, giving rise to the Heh that I return to the cosmos, and in so doing, animate the first sigil. I pause, as the light kindles, to experience the resonance between the ultimate power of creation, and the power of creation within myself. 3. Turning from sunrise to the sun at full Zenith, I reflect on the awesome majesty of creation, and the power that permeates it. As I contemplate the inconceivable wonder of the universe (with all of its myriad worlds and souls), I search for the name of its Lord ... so that I may trace my next sigil in celebration of Hir glory. Once again, I pause to wait for the channel to come to life and savor my small glimpse of the almighty. 4. Turning towards the setting sun, I reflect on the glory I have been privileged to behold. I note my breathing, and the implicit continuous prayer it offers in praise to the spirit of life. \"Ruach\" means both \"breath\" and \"spirit\", and in our breathing we speak the holy name more perfectly than words ever could. I seek to make each breath a more ardent and perfect prayer, and an act of communion. When my breath has become the name of life, I carve a sigil into which that principle can be enshrined, and welcome the spirit of life into my circle. 5. Turning to the north, I see nothing, and so confront myself - body and spirit, ego and instrument of divine will, animal and god. What am I and what am I to become? How am I to resolve a myriad of aspirations and urges? The answer is not in allowing myself to become a battleground for a thousand balkanized aspects of my own nature. The answer lies in finding purpose and becoming an instrument of that purpose. And so I acknowledge my need, and my inescapable obligation to understand and serve the divine will.

Turning again to the rising sun, and standing in the center of these channels, I look forward to find the spirit of guidance. My needs and aspirations have been anticipated, and provided for. I need not want for guide or teacher. I have but to open my eyes and see them. 7. The power of life swells behind me and within me, compelling me to action and empowering me to achieve. Life is that which does, and that which becomes. I am life, and the power is within me ... or perhaps more properly, I am a manifestation of that power. 8. On my right, I reach out to the light that vanquishes all darkness. I find therein perfection, protection and a power beyond that of life. I recognize it for what it is. I recognize that it is always there, and that I can always draw upon it (if I have but eyes to see it). I open myself to the light. 9. On my left, I reach out to a world bathed in divine light and see its richness, beauty, and perfection. It shames me to recognize how seldom I see the world so illuminated, and I am grateful to be reminded again of its true nature. 10. I stand surrounded by, and attuned to, four open channels for divine energy. Standing naked in the focal point, I reach out, simultaneously, to each. As the four streams of light converge in me, each carrying its own energy into me, I feel the parts of myself that are being brought into resonance. Finally, like a laser, pumped at the right frequency, I burst forth with a nova-like brilliance, now a source of light myself ... and unlike the sigils through which this energy was channeled, I am wholely of this world. I am the connection point between heaven and earth. I am the vehicle through which the divine Will achieves worldly manifestation. ...

A Brief History of the Golden Dawn +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- +-+-+ The history of the Golden Dawn seemingly begins in 1881, when S. L. M. Mathers met Dr.'s W. Westcott and W. Woodman, and entered the _Societas_ _Rosicruciana_in_Anglia_, a scholarly group devoted to studying"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Rosicrucian and Hermetic topics, open to Master Masons only. Westcott took young Mathers under his wing, and Mathers quickly advanced to the top of that organization. The \"magical mottoes\" of these three men may provide insight into their characters. Mathers took the mottoes \"'S Rioghail Mo Dhream,\" or \"Royal is my tribe\" in Gaelic, and \"Deo Duce Comite Ferro,\" or \"With God as my leader and the sword as my companion.\" Westcott was known as \"Sapere Aude,\" or \"Dare to be wise,\" and Woodman was known as \"Magna Est Veritas Et Praevalehit,\" or \"Great is the truth and it shall prevail.\" The next key development was in 1887 with the \"discovery\" of the famous Cypher Manuscripts. Whether found in a Masonic library, bought from a used bookshop, or fabricated whole-cloth by Westcott, these documents contained summaries of the first five G.D. initiation rituals (0=0 to 4=7). They were written in a simple, well-known alphabetic code based on the _Polygraphiae_ of Johann Trithemius, and partial transcriptions have been published in Zal- ewski's _Secret_Inner_Order_Rituals_of_the_G.D._. Mathers took to them with a passion, and fleshed them out into full-blown rituals of ceremonial magic. Written on the manuscripts was the address of a certain Fraulein Anna Sprengel (\"Sapiens Dominabitur Astris,\" or \"The wise one will be ruled by the stars\") in Germany, but many believe that Fraulein Sprengel was invented by Westcott to provide a sense of continental authority and legitimacy to this material. Even if not directly German in origin, many of the magical concepts inherent in the Golden Dawn system were strongly influenced by continental European sources. Without a doubt, the works of the esteemed French occultist Eliphas Levi (1810-1875) were known to the originators of the Golden Dawn system. Levi's students, such as Stanislas de Guaita, Josephin Peledan, and Gerard Encausse (\"Papus\") gathered in societies such as the \"Kabalistic Rose+Croix\" and the \"Catholic Rose+Croix of the Temple and the Grail.\" From the 1880's to the 1910's, these groups, or Salons, gathered to study ancient texts, practice magic and meditative techniques, and spread their occult knowledge to the public. It was a year later, in 1888, that Mathers, Westcott, and Woodman inaugurated the first British Temple, Isis-Urania, and began to admit men and women as Neophytes. In 1890, Mathers married Mina (\"Moina\") Bergson, sister of philo- sopher and writer Henri Bergson, and in 1892 they moved to Paris. The Ahathoor"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Temple was established, and it was not too long after that they clairvoyantly \"brought forth\" the Second Order (5=6 to 7=4) rituals and teachings. Some of the 5=6 ritual material, however, came from the Cypher Manuscripts (not in- cluded in Zalewski's transcription). The first Vault of the Adepti, a required piece of \"scenery\" for Second Order rituals, was built in London, in Thavies Inn off Holborn Circus. The following list of original G.D. Temples comes from Ithell Colquhoun's biography of Mathers, _Sword_of_Wisdom_, and seems to be relatively complete. Any additional information, of course, would be greatly appreciated:  ORIGINAL GOLDEN DAWN TEMPLES 1. Licht, Liebe, und Leben, c1870 (Nuremburg: Fraulein Sprengel) [FICTIONAL?] 2.

Ms. Annie Hornimann, a member of the Isis-Urania Second Order, led a \"revolt\" against Mathers, and there was a bit of litigation concerning the ownership of the temple furniture and other magical trappings. Also, many remaining G.D. members were duped by a Mr. and Mrs. \"Theo Horos,\" American confidence tricksters, and lost a great deal of money and property. The Horos couple were convicted of fraud and the rape of minors in 1901, but the G.D. was dragged through the mud of ignorant publicity, and was never again the same. Finally, in 1903, Aleister Crowley, who previously seemed the \"magical heir apparent\" to Mathers, defected to form his own organizations. In 1909, Crowley published G.D. rituals and doctrine in his _Equinox_, but its limited readership precluded the kind"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"of impact that Regardie's subsequent publishing efforts produced. With the \"golden age\" of the G.D. over, its members went their myriad ways. The Golden Dawn work, however, has been continued by many groups. Most noticeably, there was the _Stella_Matutina_, and its varied offshoots, inaugurated by Dr. Robert William Felkin (\"Finem Respisce,\" or \"Have re- gard to the end\"), and continued in an unbroken line until as late as the 1970's. Also noteworthy is the contribution of Violet Mary Firth (Dion Fortune; from \"Deo Non Fortuna,\" or \"God, not chance\"), who formed the Fraternity (later, Society) of the Inner Light, which functioned for many decades as an alternative, but closely-related, group. What follows is a far-from-complete listing of these succeeding organiz- ations, mostly culled from Colquhoun's _Sword_of_Wisdom_. Note that the list ends near the beginning of the 1970's.

I will start this list with a classified advertisement from the Winter 1991 issue of _Gnosis_ magazine, which parallels my own opinions: \"The Golden Dawn is not a commercial enterprise. Initiation is not for sale. There are Temples that hold valid initiatory succession from the original Mother Temple in London which are quietly doing the Great Work. The Order exists. When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\" Anyway, the following list attempts to be in alphabetic order: * August Order of Light Various Locations, England [Descended from the original Horus Temple of the G.D. in Bradford, England, this group was originally comprised only of members of the Masonic _Societas_Rosicruciana_in_Anglia_, but they currently number about 87 men and women. One of the Temples has a correspondence course, but they seem very selective in who participates. Unlike some other G.D.

Free brochure available. Correspondence course. For the first year or so, one pays $10/month, and obtains a self-initiation ritual, seven weeks of instruction on \"Practical Occultism,\" then about a year of Tarot instruction. The Tarot material is highly recommended. If one is near a BOTA Temple or Proanos, members can participate in rituals, Temple services, and init- iations. Local study groups are also in many cities.

Originated as The Hermetic Brotherhood of Light in Scotland in the late 1870's, members such as Peter Davidson and \"Max Theon\" circulated lessons on magic (sexual magic in higher degrees) mainly through the mail. In the 1890's, a lodge formed in France which contained many prominent French occult- ists. Also, Davidson moved to Georgia and founded a Christian myst- ical community. In 1915, Elbert Benjamine (\"C. C. Zain\") came from Georgia to California, and assimilated Davidson's material into 210 lessons in 22 books, and began the Church of Light in 1932. Its focus is mainly on astrology (the \"Religion of the Stars\"), but there are fifty initiatory degrees as well.
