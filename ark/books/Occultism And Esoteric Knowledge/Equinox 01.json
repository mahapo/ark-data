Whatever knowledge may previously have been imputed to men, it has always been fenced in with conditions and restrictions. The time has come to speak plainly , and so far as may be in the language of the multitude. Thus, the Brothers of the A ∴ A ∴ announce themselves without miracle or mystery. It is easy for every charlatan to perform wonders, to bewilder and even to deceive not only fools but all persons, however shrewd, untrained in observation; nor does the trained observed always succeed i nstantly in detecting the fraud. Again, what the A ∴ A ∴ propose to do is to enable such men as are capable of advancement to a higher interpretation of manhood to do so; and the proof of their ability lies in their success, and not in any other irrelevant p henomenon. The argument from miracles is a non sequitur. Nor is there anything mysterious in the A ∴ A ∴ ; one must not confuse the mysterious with the unknown.

The Brothers of the A ∴ A ∴ have set their faces against all charlatanism, whether of miracle - mongering or obscurantism; and all those persons who have sought reputation or wealth by such means may expect ruthless exposure, whether of their vanity or their dishonesty; for by no gentler means can they be taught. The Brothers of the A ∴ A ∴ will advise simple experiments, and will describe them, by the pens of their chosen delegates, in the simplest available language.

This community possesses a School, in which all who thirst for knowledge are instructed by the Spirit of Wisdom itself; and all the mysteries of nature are preserved in this school for the children of light. Perfect knowledge of nature and of humani ty is taught in this school. It is from her that all truths penetrate into the world; she is the school of all who search for wisdom, and it is in this community alone that truth and the explantation of all mystery are to be found. It is the most hidde n of communities, yet it contains members from many circles; nor is there any Centre of Thought whose activity is not due to the presence of one of ourselves. From all time there has been an exterior school based on the interior one, of which it is but th e outer expression. From all time, therefore, there has been a hidden assembly, a society of the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 8 Elect, of those who sought for and had capacity for light, and this interior society was the Axle of the R.O.T.A. All that any external order possesses in s ymbol, ceremony, or rite is the letter expressive outwardly of that spirit of truth which dwelleth in the interior Sanctuary. Nor is the contradiction of the exterior any bar to the harmony of the interior. Hence this Sanctuary, composed of members wid ely scattered indeed but united by the bonds of perfect love, has been occupied from the earliest ages in building the grand Temple (through the evolution of humanity) by which the reign of L.V.X. will be manifest. This society is in the communion of those who have most capacity for light; they are united in truth, and their Chief is the Light of the World himself, V.V.V.V.V., the One Anointed in Light, the single teacher for the human race, the Way, the Truth, and the Life. The interior Order was formed immediately after the first perception of man's wider heritage had dawned upon the first of the adepts; it received from the Masters at first - hand the revelation of the means by which humanity could be raised to its rights and delivered from its misery. It received the primitive charge of all revelation and mystery; it received the key of true science, both divine and natural. But as men multiplied, the frailty of man necessitated an exterior society which veiled the interior one, and concealed the spirit and the truth in the letter, because many people wer e not capable of comprehending great interior truth. Therefore, interior truths were wrapped in external and perceptible ceremonies, so that men, by the perception of the outer which is the symbol of th e interior, might by degrees be"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"AN ACCOUNT OF A ∴ A ∴ 9 enabled safely to approach the interior spiritual truths. But the inner truth has always been confided to him who in his day had the most capacity for illumination, and he became the sole guardian of the original Trust, as H igh Priest of the Sanctuary. When it became necessary that interior truths should be enfolded in exterior ceremony and symbol, on account of the real weakness of men who were not capable of hearing the Light of Light, then exterior worship began. It was, however, always the type or symbol of the interior, that is to say, the symbol of the true and Secret Sacrament. The external worship would never have been separated from interior revel but for the weakness of man, which tends too easily to forget the sp irit in the letter; but the Masters are vigilant to note in every nation those who are able to receive light, and such persons are employed as agents to spread the light according to man's capacity and to revivify the dead letter. Through these instrument s the interior truths of the Sanctuary were taken into every nation, and modified symbolically according to their customs, capacity for in - struction, climate, and receptiveness. So that the external types of every religion, worship, ceremonies and Sacred Books in general have more or less clearly, as their object of instruction, the interior truths of the Sanctuary, by which man will be conducted to the universal knowledge of the one Absolute Truth. The more the external worship of a people has remained u nited with the spirit of esoteric truth, the purer its religion; but the wider the difference between the symbolic letter and"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 10 the invisible truth, the more imperfect has become the religion. Finally, it may be, the external form has entirely parted from i ts inner truth, so that ceremonial observances without soul or life have remained alone. In the midst of all this, truth reposes inviolable in the inner Sanctuary. Faithful to the spirit of truth, the members of the interior Order live in silence, but in real activity. Yet, besides their secret holy work, they have from time to time decided upon political strategic action. Thus, when the earth was night utterly corrupt by reason of the Great Sorcery, the Brethren sent Mohammed to bring freedom to mankin d by the sword. This being but partially a success, they raised up one Luther to teach freedom of thought. Yet this freedom soon turned into a heavier bondage than before. Then the Brethren delivered unto man the knowledge of nature, and the keys thereo f; yet this also was prevented by the Great Sorcery. Now then finally in nameless ways, as one of our Brethren hath it now in mind to declare, have they raised up One to deliver unto men the keys of Spiritual Knowledge, and by His work shall He be judged. This interior community of light is the reunion of all those capable of receiving light, and it is known as the Communion of Saints, the primitive receptacle for all strength and truth, confided to it from all time. By it the agents of L.V.X. were forme d in every age, passing from the interior to the exterior, and communicating spirit and life to the dead letter, as already said."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"AN ACCOUNT OF A ∴ A ∴ 11 This illuminated community is the true school of L.V.X.; it has its Chair, its Doctors; it possesses a rule for students; it has forms and objects for study. It has also its degrees for successive development to greater altitudes. This school of wisdom has been for ever most secretly hidden from the world, because it is invisible and submissive solely to illuminated governmen t. It has never been exposed to the accidents of time and to the weakness of man, because only the most capable were chosen for it, and those who selected made no error. Through this school were developed the germs of all the sublime sciences, which were first received by external schools, then clothed in other forms, and hence degenerated. According to time and circumstances, the society of sages communicated unto the exterior societies their symbolic hieroglyphs, in order to attract man to the great tr uths of their Sanctuary. But all exterior societies subsist only by virtue of this interior one. As soon as external societies wish to transform a temple of wisdom into a political edifice, the interior society retires and leaves only the letter without the spirit. It is thus that secret external societies of wisdom were nothing but hieroglyphic screens, the truth remaining inviolable in the Sanctuary so that she might never be profaned. In this interior society man finds wisdom and with her All — not the wisdom of this world, which is but scientific knowledge, which revolves round the outside but never touches the centre (in which is contained all strength), but true wisdom, understanding and knowledge, reflections of the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 12 supreme illumination. All dispute s, all controversies, all the things belonging to the false cares of this world, fruitless discussions, useless germs of opinions which spread the seeds of disunion, all error, schisms, and systems are banished. Neither calumny nor scandal is known. Ever y man is honoured. Love alone reigns. We must not, however, imagine that this society resembles any secret society, meeting at certain times, choosing leaders and members, united by special objects. All societies, be what they may, can but come after th is interior illuminated circle. This society knows none of the formalities which belong to the outer rings, the work of man. In this kingdom of power all outward forms cease. L.V.X. is the Power always present. The greatest man of his times, the chief himself, does not always know all the members, but the moment when it is necessary that he should accomplish any object he finds them in the world with certainty ready to his hand. This community has no outside barriers. He who may be chosen is as the fi rst; he presents himself among the others without presumption, and he is received by the others without jealousy. It if be necessary that real members should meet together, they find and recognize each other with perfect certainty. No disguise can be use d, neither hypocrisy nor dissimulation could hide the characteristic qualities which distinguish the members of this society. All illusion is gone, and things appear in their true form. No one member can choose another; unanimous choice is required. Tho ugh not all men are called, many of the called"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"AN ACCOUNT OF A ∴ A ∴ 13 are chosen, and that as soon as they become fit for entrance. Any man can look for the entrance, and any man who is within can teach another to seek for it; but only he who is fit can arrive within. Unprepare d men occasion disorder in a community, and disorder is not compatible with the Sanctuary. Thus it is impossible to profane the Sanctuary, since admission is not formal but real. Worldly intelligence seeks this Sanctuary in vain; fruitless also will be t he efforts of malice to penetrate these great mysteries; all is indecipherable to him who is not ripe; he can see nothing, read nothing in the interior. He who is fit is joined to the chain, perhaps often where he though least likely, and at a point of wh ich he knew nothing himself. To become fit should be the sole effort of him who seeks wisdom. But there are methods by which fitness is attained, for in this holy communion is the primitive storehouse of the most ancient and original science of the human race, with the primitive mysteries also of all science. It is the unique and really illuminated community which is absolutely in posses - sion of the key to all mystery, which knows the centre and source of all nature. It is a society which unites superio r strength to its own, and counts its members from more than one world. It is the society whose members form the republic of Genius, the Regent Mother of the whole World.

He who knoweth little, thinketh he knoweth much; but he w ho knoweth much hath learned his own ignorance. Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool, than of him. 6. Be not hasty to condemn others; how knowest thou that in their place, thou couldest have resisted the temptation? And even were it so, why shouldst thou despise one who is weaker than thyself? 7. Thou therefore who desirest Magical Gifts, be sure that thy soul is firm and steadfast; for it is by flattering thy weaknesses that the Weak Ones will gain power over thee.

Do good unto others for its own sake, not for reward, not for gratitude from t hem, not for sympathy. If thou art generous, thou wilt not long for thine ears to be tickled by expressions of gratitude. 12. Remember that unbalanced force is evil; that unbalanced severity is but cruelty and oppression; but that also unbalanced mercy is bu t weakness which would allow and abet Evil. Act passionately; think rationally; be Thyself. 13. True ritual is as much action as word; it is Will. 14.

It is absolutely necessary that all experiments should be recorded i n detail during, or immediately after, their performance. 2. It is highly important to note the physical and mental condition of the experimenter or experimenters. 3. The time and place of all experiments must be noted; also the state of the weather, and gener ally all conditions which might conceivably have any result upon the experiment either as adjuvants to or causes of the result, or as inhibiting it, or as sources of error. 4. The A.'. A.'. will not take official notice of any experiments which are not thus properly recorded. 5. It is not necessary at this stage for us to declare fully the ultimate end of our researches; nor indeed would it be understood by those who have not become proficient in these elementary courses. 6.

Let then the record be written with sincerity and care, and with practice it will be found more and more to approximate to the ideal. II Physical Clairvoyance 1. Take a pack of ( 78 ) Tarot playing cards. Shuffle; cut. Draw one car d. Without looking at it, try and name it. Write down the card you name, and the actual card. Repeat, and tabulate results. 2. This experiment is probably easier with an old genuine pack of Tarot cards, preferably a pack used for divination by some one who re ally understood the matter. 3. Remember that one should expect to name the right card once in 78 times. Also be careful to exclude all possibilities of obtaining the knowledge through the ordinary senses of sight and touch, or even smell. There was once a ma n whose finger - tips were so sensitive that he could feel the shape and position of the pips, and so judge the card correctly."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"LIBER E 27 4. It is better to try first, the easier form of the experiment, by guessing only the suit. 5. Remember that in 78 experiments you sho uld obtain 22 trumps and 14 of each other suit; so that, without any clairvoyance at all, you can guess right twice in 7 times (roughly) by calling trumps each time. 6. Note that some cards are harmonious. Thus it would not be a bad error to call the five of Swords (“The Lord of Defeat”) instead of the ten of Swords (“The Lord of Ruin”). But to call the Lord of Love ( 2 Cups) for the Lord of Strife ( 5 Wands) would show that you were getting nothing right. Similarly, a card ruled by Mars would be harmonious with a 5 , a card of Gemini with “The Lovers.” 7. These harmonies must be thoroughly learnt, according to the numerous tables given in 777 . 8. As you progress, you will find that you are able to distinguish the suit correctly three times in four, and that very f ew indeed inharmonious errors occur, while in 78 experiments you are able to name the card aright as many as 15 or 20 times. 9. When you have reached this stage, you may be admitted for examination; and in the event of your passing, you will be given more co mplex and difficult exercises. III Asana — Posture 1. You must learn to sit perfectly still with every muscle tense for long periods."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 28 2.

Kneel; buttocks resting on the heels, toes turned back, back and head straight, hands on thighs. 5. The third position: (The Ibis). Stand ; hold left ankle with right hand (and alternately practise right ankle in left hand, &c.) free forefinger on lips. 6. The fourth position: (The Thunderbolt). Sit: left heel pressing up anus, right foot poised on its toes, the heel covering the phallus; arm s stretched out over the knees: head and back straight. 7. Various things will happen to you while you are practising these positions; they must be carefully analysed and described. 8. Note down the duration of the pracitce, the severity of the pain (if any) w hich accompanies it, the degree of rigidity attained, and any other pertinent matters. 9. When you have progressed up to the point that a saucer filled to the brim with water and poised upon the head does not spill one drop during a whole hour, and when you can no longer perceive the slightest tremor in any muscle; when, in short, you are perfectly steady and easy, you will be admitted for examination; and, should you pass, you will be instructed in more complex and difficult practices.

Breathe in through the same nostril fo r 10 seconds. Changing hands, repeat with the other nostril. Let this be continuous for one hour. 2.

When this has become perfectly easy to you, you may be admitted for examination, and should you pass, you will be instructed in more complex and difficult practices. 6. You will find that the presence of food in the stomach, even in small quan tities, makes the practices very difficult. 7. Be very careful never to overstrain your powers; especially never get so short of breath that you are compelled to breathe out jerkily or rapidly. 8.

The five tatwas are usefu l for this purpose; they are: a black oval; a blue disk; a silver crescent; a yellow square; a red triangle. 2. Proceed to combinations of simple objects; e.g ., a black oval within a yellow square, and so on. 3. Proceed to simple moving objects, such as a pend ulum swinging, a wheel revolving, &c.

The relation between the two movements should be varied in different experiments. Or e ven a system of fly - wheels, eccentrics, and governor. 5. During these practices the mind must be absolutely confined to the object determined upon; no other thought must be allowed to intrude upon the consciousness. The moving systems must be regular and ha rmonious. 6. Note carefully the duration of the experiments, the number and nature of the intruding thoughts, the tendency of the object itself to depart from the course laid out for it, and any other phenomena which may present themselves. Avoid overstrain . This is very important. 7. Proceed to imagine living objects; as a man, preferably some man known to, and respected by, yourself. 8. In the intervals of these experiments you may try to"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"LIBER E 31 imagine the objects of the other senses, and to concentrate upon them. For example, try to imagine the taste of chocolate the smell of roses, the feeling of velvet, the sound of a waterfall, or the ticking of a watch. 9. Endeavour finally to shut out all objects of any of the senses, and prevent all thoughts arising in your min d. When you feel that you have attained some success in these practices, apply for examination, and should you pass, more complex and difficult practices will be prescribed for you. VI Physical Limitations 1. It is desirable that you should discover for yo urself your physical limiations. 2. To this end ascertain for how many hours you can subsist without food or drink before your working capacity is seriously interfered with. 3. Ascertain how much alcohol you can take, and what forms of drunkenness assail you. 4. Ascertain how far you can walk without once stopping; likewise with dancing, swimming, running, &c. 5. Ascertain for how many hours you can do without sleep. 6. Test your endurance with various gymnastic exercises, club - swinging and so on. 7. Ascertain for how long you can keep silence. 8.

The obje ct of most of the foregoing practices will not at first be clear to you; but at least (who will deny it?) they will have trained you in determination, accuracy, introspection, and many other qualities which are valuable to all men in their ordinary avocati ons, so that in no case will your time have been wasted. 2. That you may gain some insight into the nature of the Great Work which lies beyond these elementary trifles, however, we should mention that an intelligent person may gather more than a hint of its nature from the following books, which are to be taken as serious and learned contributions to the study of nature, though not necessarily to be implicitly relied upon. “The Yi K ing” [S.B.E. Series, Oxford University Press]. “The Tao Teh K ing” [S.B.E. Se ries]. “Tannhäuser” by A. Crowley. “The Upanishads.” “The Bhagavad - Gita.” “The Voice of the Silence.” “Raja Yoga” by Swami Vivekƒnanda. “The Shiva Sanhita.”"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"LIBER E 33 “The Aphorisms of Patanjali.” “The Sword of Song.” “The Book of the Dead.” “Rituel et Dogme de l a Haute Magie.” “The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.” “The Goetia.” “The Hathayoga Pradipika.” Erdmann's “History of Philosophy.” “The Spiritual Guide of Molinos.” “The Star in the West” (Captain Fuller). “The Dhammapada\" [S.B.E.

Careful study of these books will enable the pupil to speak in the lan guage of his master and facilitate communication with him. 4. The pupil should endeavour to discover the fundamental harmony of these very varied works; for this purpose he will find it best to study the most extreme divergences side by side. 5. He may at any t ime that he wishes apply for examination in this course of reading. 6. During the whole of this elementary study and practice, he will do wisely to seek out, and attach himself to, a master, one competent to correct him and advise him. Nor"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 34 should he be dis couraged by the difficulty of finding such a person. 7. Let him further remember that he must in no wise rely upon, or believe in, that master. He must rely entirely upon himself, and credit nothing whatever but that which lies within his own knowledge and e xperience. 8. As in the beginning, so at the end, we here insist upon the vital importance of the written record as the only possible check upon error derived from the various qualities of the experimenter. 9. Thus let the work be accomplished duly; yea, let i t be accomplished duly.

A LEISTER C ROWLEY . "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"  THE MAGIC GLASSES "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"49 THE MAGIC GLASSES O NE raw November morning, I left my rooms near the British Museum and turned d own Regent street. It was cold and misty: the air like shredded cotton - wool. Before I reached the Quadrant, the mist thickened to fog, with the colour of muddied water, and walking became difficult. As I had no particular object in view, I got into talk with a policeman, and, by his advice, went into the Vine Street Police Court, to pass an hour or two before lunch. Inside the court, the atmosphere was comparatively clear, and I took my seat on one of the oak benches with a feeling of vague curiosity. There was a case going on as I entered: an old man, who pretended to be an optician, had been taken up by the police for obstructing the traffic by selling glasses. His green tray, with leathern shoulder - straps, was on the solicitor's table. The charge o f obstruction could not be sustained, the old man had moved on as soon as the police told him to, and the inspector had substituted a charge of fraud, on the complaint of a workman and a shopkeeper. A constable had just finished his evidence when I came i nto the court. He left the box with a self - satisfied air and the muttered remark that the culprit was “a rare bad 'un.” I glanced about for the supposed criminal and found that he was seated near me on a cross - bench in the charge of a"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 50 sturdy policeman. H e did not look like a criminal: he was tall, thin and badly dressed in a suit of rusty black, which seemed to float about his meagre person; his complexion was tallowy - white, like the sprouts of potatoes which have been kept a long time in a dark cellar; h e seemed about sixty years old. But he had none of the furtive glances of the criminal; none of the uneasiness: his eye rested on mine and passed aside with calm indifference, contemplative and not alarmed. The workman who was produced by the police in su pport of the charge of fraud amused me. He was a young man, about middle height, and dressed in corduroys, with a rough jacket of dark tweed. He was a bad witness: he hesitated, stopped and corrected himself, as if he didn't know the meaning of any words except the commonest phrases of everyday use. But he was evidently honest: his brown eyes looked out on the world fairly enough. His faltering came from the fact that he was only half articulate. Disentangled from the mist of inappropriate words, his me aning was sufficiently clear. He had been asked by the accused, whom he persisted in calling “the old gentleman,” to buy a pair of spectacles: they would show him things truer - like than he could see 'em; and so he “went a bob on 'em.” Questioned by the m agistrate as to whether he could see things more plainly through the glasses, he shook his head: “No; about the same.” Then came the question: had he been deceived? Apparently he didn't know the meaning of the word “deceived.” “Cheated,” the magistrate s ubstituted."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 51 “No”; he hadn't been cheated. “Well, disappointed then?” “No”; he couldn't say that. “Would he spend another shilling on a similar pair of glasses?” “No,” he would not; “one bob was enough to lose.” When told he might go, he shuffled out of t he witness - box, and on his way to the door attempted more than once to nod to the accused. Evidently there was no malice in him. The second police witness had fluency and self - possession enough for a lawyer: a middle - aged man, tall, florid and inclined t o be stout; he was over - dressed, like a spruce shopman, in black frock - coat, grey trousers and light - coloured tie. He talked volubly, with a hot indignation which seemed to match his full red cheeks. If the workman was an un - decided and weak witness, Mr. Hallett, of High Holborn, was a most convinced and determined witness. He had been induced to buy the glasses, he declared, by the “old party,” who told him that they would show him things exactly as they were — the truth of everything. You'd only have to look through 'em at a man to see whether he was trying to “do” you or not. That was why he bought them. He was not asked a shilling for them, but a sovereign and he gave it — twenty shillings. When he put the glasses on, he could see nothing with them, no thing at all; it was a “plant”: and so he wanted the “old party” to take 'em back and return his sovereign; that might have caused the obstruction that the policeman had objected to. The “old man” refused to give him his money back; said he had not cheate d him; had the impudence to pretend that he (Hallett) had no eyes for truth,"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 52 and, therefore, could see nothing with the glasses. “A blamed lie,” he called it, and a “do,” and the “old man” ought to get six months for it. Once or twice, the magistrate had to direct the stream of emphatic words. But the accusation was formal and precise. The question now was: How would the magistrate deal with the case? At first sight, Mr. Brown, the magistrate, made a good impression on me. He was getting on in life: th e dark hair was growing thin on top and a little grey at the sides. The head was well - shaped; the forehead notably broad; the chin and jaw firm. The only unpleasant feature in the face was the hard line of mouth, with thin, unsympathetic lips. Mr. Brown was reputed to be a great scholar, and was just the type of man who would have made a pedant; a man of good intellect and thin blood, who would find books and words more interesting than men and deeds. At first, Mr. Brown had seemed to be on the side of the accused: he tried to soften Mr. Hallett's anger. One or two of his questions, indeed, were pointed and sensible: “You wouldn't take goods back after you had sold them, would you, Mr. Hallett?” he asked. “Of course I would,” replied Mr. Hallett, stou tly: “I'd take any of my stock back at a twenty per cent. reduction; my goods are honest goods: prices marked plain on 'em. But 'e would not give me fifteen shillings back out of my sovereign; not 'e; 'e meant sticking' to it all.” The magistrate looked in to the body of the court and addressing the accused, said: “Will you reserve your defence, Mr. Henry?” “Penry, your worship: Matthew Penry,” corrected the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 53 old man in a quiet, low - pitched voice, as he rose to his feet. “If I may say so: the charge of fra ud is absurd. Mr. Hallett seems to be angry because I sold one pair of glasses for a shilling and another pair to him for a sovereign. But they were not the same glasses and, if they had been, I am surely allowed to ask for my wares what I please.” “That is true,” interrupted the magistrate; “but he says that you told him he would see the truth through them. I suppose you meant that he would see more truly through them than with his own eyes?” “Yes,” replied Mr. Penry, with a certain hesitation. “But he did not see more truly through them,” continued the magistrate, “or he would not have wanted you to take them back.” “No,” Mr. Penry acknowledged; “but that is this fault, not the fault of the glasses. They would show the truth, if he had any faculty for seeing it: glasses are no good to the blind.” “Come, come,” said the magistrate; “now you are beginning to confuse me. You don't really pretend that your glasses will show the truth of things, the reality; you mean that they will improve one's sight, don 't you?” “Yes,” replied Mr. Penry, “One's sight for truth, for reality.” “Well,” retorted the magistrate smiling, “That seems rather metaphysical than practical, doesn't it? If your spectacles enabled one to discern the truth, I'd buy a pair myself: they might be useful in this court sometimes,” and he looked about him with a smile, as if expecting applause. With eager haste, the old man took him at his word,"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 54 threw open his case, selected a pair of glasses, and passed them to the clerk, who handed them u p to Mr. Brown. The magistrate put the glasses on; looked round the court for a minute or two, and then broke out: “Dear me! Dear me! How extraordinary! These glasses alter every one in the court. It's really astonishing. They don't improve the look s of people; on the contrary, a more villainous set of countenances it would be difficult to imagine. If these glasses are to be trusted, men are more like wild animals than human beings, and the worst of all are the solicitors; really a terrible set of fa ces. But this may be the truth of things; these spectacles do show one more than one's ordinary eyes can perceive. Dear me! Dear me! It is most astonishing; but I feel inclined to accept Mr. Penry's statement about them,” and he peered over the spectac les at the court. “Would you like to look in a glass, your worship?” asked one of the solicitors drily, rising, however, to his feet with an attitude of respect at the same time; “perhaps that would be the best test.” Mr. Brown appeared to be a little sur prised, but replied: “If I had a glass I would willingly.” Before the words were out of his mouth, his clerk had tripped round the bench, gone into the magistrate's private room and returned with a small looking - glass, which he handed up to his worship. As Mr. Brown looked in the glass, the smile of expectancy left his face. In a moment or two, he put down the glass gravely, took off the spectacles and handed them to the clerk,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 55 who returned them to Mr. Penry. After a pause, he said shortly: “It is well, perhaps, to leave all these matters of fact to a jury. I will accept a small bail, Mr. Penry,” he went on; “but I think you must be bound over to answer this charge at the sessions.” I caught the words, “£ 50 a - piece in two sureties and his own recognisanc es in £ 100 ,” and then Mr. Penry was told by the policeman to go and wait in the body of the court till the required sureties were forthcoming. By chance, the old man came and sat beside me and I was able to examine him closely. His moustache and beard mu st have been auburn at one time, but now the reddish tinge seemed only to discolour the grey. The beard was thin and long and unkempt, and added to the forlorn untidiness of his appearance. He carried his head bent forward, as if the neck were too weak t o support it. He seemed feeble and old and neglected. He caught me looking at him, and I noticed that his eyes were a clear blue, as if he were younger than I had thought. His gentle, scholarly manner and refined voice had won my sympathy; and, when our eyes met, I introduced myself and told him I should be glad to be one of his sureties, if that would save him time or trouble. He thanked me with a sort of detached courtesy: he would gladly accept my offer. “You stated your case,” I remarked, “so that y ou confused the magistrate. You almost said that you glasses were — magic glasses,” I went on, smiling and hesitating, because I did not wish to offend him, and yet hardly knew how to convey the impression his words had left upon me."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 56 “Magic glasses,” he re peated gravely, as if weighing the words; “yes, you might call them magic glasses.” To say that I was astonished only gives a faint idea of my surprise and wonder: “Surely, you don't mean that they show things as they are,” I asked: “the truth of things?” “That is what I mean,” he replied quietly. “Then they are not ordinary glasses?” I remarked inanely. “No,” he repeated gravely; “not ordinary glasses.” He had a curious trick, I noticed, of peering at one very intently with narrowed eyes and then blinki ng rapidly several times in succession as if the strain were too great to be borne. He had made me extremely curious, and yet I did not like to ask outright to be allowed to try a pair of his glasses; so I went on with my questions: “But, if they show tr uth, how was it that Mr. Hallett could see nothing through them?” “Simply because he has no sense of reality; he has killed the innate faculty for truth. It was probably at not time very great,” went on this strange merchant, smiling; “but his trader's ha bits have utterly destroyed it; he has so steeped himself in lies that he is now blind to the truth, incapable of perceiving it. The workman, you remember, could see fairly well through his spectacles.” “Yes,” I replied laughing; “and the magistrate evide ntly saw a good deal more through his than he cared to acknowledge.” The old man laughed too, in an ingenuous, youthful way that I found charming. At last I got to the Rubicon."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 57 “Would you let me buy a pair of your glasses?” I asked. “I shall be delighte d to give you a pair, if you will accept them,” he replied, with eager courtesy; “my surety ought certainly to have a pair”; and then he peered at me in his curious, intent way. A moment later, he turned round, and opening his tray, picked out a pair of s pectacles and handed them to me. I put them on with trembling eagerness and stared about me. The magistrate had told the truth; they altered everything: the people were the same and yet not the same; this face was coarsened past all description; that fac e sharpened and made hideous with greed; and the other brutalized with lust. One recognized, so to speak, the dominant passion in each person. Something moved me to turn my glasses on the merchant; if I was astounded before, I was now lost in wonder: the glasses transfigured him. The grey beard was tinged with gold, the blue eyes luminous with intelligence; all the features ennobled; the countenance irradiated sincerity and kindliness. I pulled off the glasses hastily and the vision passed away. Mr. Pen ry was looking at me with a curious little pleased smile of anticipation: involuntarily, I put out my hand to him with a sort of reverence: “Wonderful,” I exclaimed; “your face is wonderful and all the others grotesque and hideous. What does it mean? Te ll me! Won't you?” “You must come with me to my room,” he said, “where we can talk freely, and I think you will not regret having helped me. I should like to explain everything to you. There are so few men,” he added, “who proffer help to another"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 58 man i n difficulty. I should like to show you that I am grateful.” “There is no cause for gratitude,” I said hastily; “I have done nothing.” His voice now seemed to me to be curiously refined and impressive, and recalled to me the vision of his face, made beaut iful by the strange glasses. . . . I have been particular to put down how Mr. Penry first appeared to me, because after I had once seen him through his spectacles, I never saw him again as I had seen him at first. Remembering my earliest impressions of hi m, I used to wonder how I could have been so mistaken. His face had refinement and gentleness in every line; a certain courage, too, that was wholly spiritual. Already I was keenly interested in Mr. Penry; eager to know more about him; to help him, if th at were possible, in any and every way. Some time elapsed before the formalities for his bail were arranged, and then I persuaded him to come out with me to lunch. He got up quietly, put the leathern straps over his shoulders, tucked the big case under h is arm and walked into the street with perfect self - possession; and I was not now in any way ashamed of his appearance, as I should have been an hour or two before: I was too excited even to feel pride; I was simply glad and curious. And this favourable i mpression grew with everything Mr. Penry said and did, till at last nothing but service would content me; so, after lunch, I put him into a cab and drove him off to my own solicitor. I found Mr. Morris, of Messrs. Morris, Coote and Co., quite willing to ta ke up his case at the sessions; willing, too, to believe that the charge was “trumped"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 59 up” by the police and without serious foundation. But, when I drew Mr. Morris aside and tried to persuade him that his new client was a man of extraordinary powers, he s miled incredulously. “You are enthusiastic, Mr. Winter,” he said half reproachfully; “but we solicitors are compelled to see things in the cold light of reason. Why should you undertake to defend this Mr. Penry? Of course if you have made up your mind,” he went on, passing over my interruption, “I shall do my best for him; but if I were you, I'd keep my eyes open and do nothing rashly.” In order to impress him, I put on a similar cold tone and declared that Mr. Penry was a friend of mine and that he must leave no stone unturned to vindicate his honesty. And with this I went back to Mr. Penry, and we left the office together. Mr. Penry's lodging disappointed me; my expectations, I am afraid, were now tuned far above the ordinary. It was in Chelsea, high up, in a rickety old house overlooking a dingy road and barges drawn up on the slimy, fetid mud - banks. And yet, even here, romance was present for the romantic; the fog - wreaths curling over the river clothed the houses opposite in soft mystery, as if they had been draped in blue samite, and through the water - laden air the sun glowed round and red as a fiery wheel of Phaeton's chariot. The room was very bare; by the broad low window stood a large deal table crowded with instruments and glasses; strong elec tric lamps on the right and left testified to the prolonged labours of the optician. The roof of the garret ran up towards the centre, and by the wall there was a low truckle - bed, fenced off by a cheap Japanese paper - screen. The whole of the wall between"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 60 the bed and the window was furnished with pine - shelves, filled with books; everything was neat, but the room seemed friendless and cold in the thick, damp air. There we sat and talked together, till the sun slid out of sight and the fog thickened and nig ht came on: there our acquaintance, so strangely begun, grew to friendship. Before we went to dinner, the old man had shown me the portraits of his two daughters and a little miniature of his wife, who had died fifteen years before. It was the first of ma ny talks in that room, the first of many confidences. Bit by bit, I heard the whole of Mr. Penry's history. It was told to me piecemeal and inconsequently, as a friend talks to a friend in growing intimacy; and, if I now let Mr. Penry tell his tale in regu lar sequence and at one stretch, it is mainly in order to spare the reader the tedium of interrupted narration and needless repetitions. *  *  *  *  * “My father was an optician,” Mr. Penry began, “and a maker of spectacles in Chelsea. We lived o ver the shop in the King's Road, and my childhood was happy enough, but not in any way peculiar. Like other healthy children, I liked play much better than lessons; but my school - days were too uneventful, too empty of love to be happy. My mother died whe n I was too young to know or regret her, and my father was kind, in spite of his precise, puritanical ways. I was the only boy, which perhaps made him kinder to me, and very much younger than my two sisters, who were grown up when I was in short clothes a nd who married and left my father's house before I had got to know them, or to feel much affection for them."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 61 “When I was about sixteen, my father took me from school and began teaching me his own trade. He had been an admirable workman in his time, of the old English sort --- careful and capable, though somewhat slow. The desire was always present in him to grind and polish each glass as well as he could, and this practice had given him a certain repute with a circle of good customers. He taught me every part of his craft as he had learnt it; and, in the next five or six years, imbued me with his own wish to do each piece of work as perfectly as possible. But this period of imitation did not last long. Before I reached manhood, I began to draw apart fro m my father, to live my own life and to show a love of reading and thinking foreign to his habit. It was religion which separated us. At school I had learnt some French and German, and in both languages I came across sceptical opinions which slowly grew in my mind, and in time led me to discard and almost to dislike the religion of my father. I mention this simply because any little originality in me seemed to spring from this inquiry and from the mental struggle that convulsed three or four years of my youth. For months and months I read feverishly to conquer my doubts, and then I read almost as eagerly to confirm my scepticism. “I still remember the glow of surprise and hope which came over me the first time I read that Spinoza, one of the heroes of m y thought, had also made his living by polishing glasses. He was the best workman of his time, the book said, and I determined to become the best workman of my time; and, from that moment, I took to my trade seriously, strenuously. “I learned everything I could about glass, and began to"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 62 make my own material, after the best recipes. I got books on optics, too, and studied them, and so, bit by bit, mastered the science of my craft. “I was not more than nineteen or twenty when my father found out that I was a much better workman than his assistant Thompson. Some glasses had been sent to us from a great oculist in Harley Street, with a multitude of minute directions. They had been made by Thompson, and were brought back to us one afternoon by a very fidgety old gentleman who declared that they did not suit him at all. The letter which he showed from Sir William Creighton, the oculist, hinted that the glasses were not carefully made. My father was out, and in his absence I opened the letter. As soon as I h ad looked at the glasses, I saw that the complaint was justified, and I told the old gentleman so. He turned out to be the famous parliamentary speaker, Lord B. He said to me testily: “All right, young man; you make my glasses correctly and I shall be s atisfied; but not till then; you understand, not till then.” “I smiled at him and told him I would do the work myself, and he went out of the shop muttering, as if only half reassured by my promises. Then I determined to show what I could do. When my fat her returned, I told him what had happened, and asked him to leave the work to me. He consented, and I went off at once to the little workshop I had made in our back - yard and settled down to the task. I made my glass and polished it, and then ground the spectacles according to the directions. When I had finished, I sent them to Sir William Creighton with a note, and a few days afterwards we had another visit from Lord B., who told my"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 63 father that he had never had such glasses and that I was a “perfect tre asure.” Like many very crochety people, he was hard to satisfy, but one satisfied he was as lavish in praise as in blame. Lord B. made my reputation as a maker of spectacles, and for years I was content with this little triumph. . . . “I married when I was about two - or three - and - twenty, and seven or eight years afterwards my father died. The gap caused by his death, the void of loss and loneliness, was more than filled up by my young children. I had two little girls who, at this time, were a source of perpetual interest to me. How one grows to love the little creatures, with their laughter and tears, their hopes and questions and make - believe! And how one's love for them is intensified by all the trouble one takes to win their love and by all the pla ns one weaves for their future! But all this is common human experience and will only bore you. A man's happiness is not interesting to other people, and I don't know that much happiness is good for a man himself; at any rate, during the ten or fifteen y ears in which I was happiest, I did least; made least progress, I mean, as a workman and the least intellectual advantage as a man. But when my girls began to grow up and detach themselves from the home, my intellectual nature began to stir again. One mu st have some interests in life, and, if the heart is empty, the head becomes busier, I often think. “One day I had a notable visit. A man came in to get a pair of spectacles made: a remarkable man. He was young, gay and enthusiastic, with an astonishing flow of words, an astonishing brightness of speech and manner. He seemed to light up the dingy old shop with his vivacity and happy frankness. He wanted spectacles to correct a slight dissimilarity between his"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 64 right eye and his left, and he had been advi sed to come to me by Sir William Creighton, as the glasses would have to be particularly well made. I promised to work at them myself, and on that he burst out: “ ‘I shall be very curious to see whether perfect eyes help or hurt my art. You know I am a p ainter,’ he went on, throwing his hair back from his forehead, ‘and each of us painters sees life in his own way, and beauty with certain peculiarities. It would be curious, wouldn't it? if talent came from a difference between one's eyes!’ “I smiled at h is eagerness, and took down his name, then altogether unknown to me; but soon to become known and memorable above all other names: Dante Gabriel Rossetti. I made the glasses and he was enthusiastic about them, and brought me a little painting of himself b y way of gratitude. “There it is,” said Penry, pointing to a little panel that hung by his bedside; “the likeness of an extraordinary man — a genius, if ever there was one. I don't know why he took to me, except that I admired him intensely; my shop, too, was near his house in Chelsea, and he used often to drop in and pass an hour in my back parlour and talk — such talk as I had never heard before and have never heard since. His words were food and drink to me, and more than that. Either his thoughts or the magic of his personality supplied my mind with the essence of growth and vigour which had hitherto been lacking to it; in a very real sense, Rossetti became my spiritual father. He taught me things about art that I had never imagined; opened to me a new heaven and a new earth and, above all, showed me that my craft, too, had artistic possibilities in it that I had never dreamed of before."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 65 “I shall never forget the moment when he first planted the seed in me that has grown and grown till it has filled my l ife. It was in my parlour behind the shop. He had been talking in his eager, vivid way, pouring out truths and thoughts, epigrams and poetry, as a great jeweller sometimes pours gems from hand to hand. I had sat listening open - mouthed, trying to remembe r as much as I could, to assimilate some small part of all that word - wealth. He suddenly stopped, and we smoked on for a few minutes in silence; then he broke out again: “ ‘Do you know, my solemn friend,' he said abruptly, ‘that I struck an idea the othe r day which might suit you. I was reading one of Walter Scott's novels: that romantic stuff of his amuses me, you know, though it isn't as deep as the sea. Well, I found out that, about a hundred years ago, a man like you made what they call Claude - glass es. I suppose they were merely rose - tinted,' he laughed, 'but at any rate, they were supposed to make everything beautiful in a Claude - like way. Now, why shouldn't you make such glasses? It would do Englishmen a lot of good to see things rose - tinted for a while. Then, too, you might make Rossetti - glasses,' he went on, laughingly, ‘and, if these dull Saxons could only get a glimpse of the passion that possesses him, it would wake them up, I know. Why not go to work, my friend, at something worth doing? Do you know,' he continued seriously, ‘there might be something in it. I don't believe, if I had had your glasses at the beginning, I should ever have been the artist I am. I mean,' he said, talking half to himself, ‘if my eyes had been all right from th e beginning, I might perhaps have been contented with what I saw. But as my eyes were imperfect I"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 66 tried to see things as my soul saw them, and so invented looks and gestures that the real world would never have given me.’ “I scarcely understood what he me ant,” said Mr. Penry, “but his words dwelt with me: the ground had been prepared for them; he had prepared it; and at once they took root in me and began to grow. I could not get the idea of the Claude - glasses and the Rossetti - glasses out of my head, and at last I advertised for a pair of those old Claude - glasses, and in a month or so a pair turned up. “You may imagine that while I was waiting, time hung heavy on my hands. I longed to be at work; I wanted to realize the idea that had come to me while Ros setti was talking. During my acquaintance with him, I had been to his studio a dozen times, and had got to know and admire that type of woman's beauty which is now connected with his name; the woman, I mean, with swanlike throat and languid air and heavy - lidded eyes, who conveys to all of us now something of Rosetti's insatiable passion. But, while I was studying his work and going about steeped in the emotion of it, I noticed one day half a dozen girls whom Rossetti could have taken as models. I had beg un, in fact, to see the world as Rossetti saw it; and this talk of his about the Claude - glasses put the idea into my head that I might, indeed, be able to make a pair of spectacles which would enable people to see the world as Rossetti saw it and as I saw it when Rossetti's influence had entire possession of me. This would be a great deal easier to do, I said to myself, than to make a pair of Claude - glasses; for, after all, I did not know what Claude's eyes were really like and I did know the peculiarity of Rossetti's eyes. I accordingly began to study the disparate"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 67 quality in Rossetti's eyes and, after making a pair of spectacles that made my eyes see unequally to the same degree, I found that the Rossettian vision of things was sharpened and intensified t o me. From that moment on, my task was easy. I had only to study any given pair of eyes and then to alter them so that they possessed the disparity of Rossetti's eyes and the work was half done. I found, too, that I could increase this disparity a little and, in proportion as I increased it, I increased also the peculiarity of what I called the Rossettian view of things; but, if I made the disparity too great, everything became blurred again. “My researches had reached this point, when the pair of old Cl aude - glasses came into my hands. I saw at a glance that the optician of the eighteenth century had no knowledge of my work. He had contented himself, as Rossetti had guessed, with colouring the glasses very delicately and in several tints; in fact, he ha d studied the colour - peculiarities of the eye as I had studied its form - peculiarities. With this hint, I completed my work. It took me only a few days to learn that Rossetti's view of colour was just as limited, or, I should say, just as peculiar, as his view of form; and, when I once understood the peculiarities of his colour - sight, I could reproduce them as easily as I could reproduce the peculiarities of his vision of form. I then set to work to get both these peculiarities into half a dozen different sets of glasses. “The work took me some six or eight months; and, when I had done my best, I sent a little note round to Rossetti and awaited his coming with painful eagerness, hope and fear swaying me in turn. When he came, I gave him a pair of the spe ctacles; and, when he put them on and looked out into the"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 68 street, I watched him. He was surprised — that I could see — and more than a little puzzled. While he sat thinking, I explained to him what the old Claude - glasses were like and how I had developed his suggestion into this present discovery. “ ‘You are an artist, my friend,' he cried at last, 'and a new kind of artist. If you can make people see the world as Claude saw it and as I see it, you can go on to make them see it as Rembrandt saw it and Velasqu ez. You can make the dullards understand life as the greatest have understood it. But that is impossible,' he added, his face falling: 'that is only a dream. You have got my real eyes, therefore you can force others to see as I see; but you have not the real eyes of Rembrandt, or Velasquez, or Titian; you have not the physical key to the souls of the great masters of the past; and so your work can only apply to the present and to the future. But that is enough, and more than enough,' he added quickly. ' Go on: there are Millais' eyes to get too; and Corot's in France, and half a dozen others; and glad I shall be to put you on the scent. You will do wonderful things, my friend, wonderful things.' “I was mightily uplifted by his praise and heart - glad, too , in my own way; but resolved at the same time not to give up the idea of making Velasquez - glasses and Rembrandt - glasses; for I had come to know and to admire these masters through Rossetti's talk. He was always referring to them, quoting them, so to say; and, for a long time past, I had accustomed myself to spend a couple of afternoons each week in our National Gallery, in order to get some knowledge of the men who were the companions of his spirit. “For nearly a year after this, I spent every hour of my spare"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 69 time studying in the National; and at last it seemed to me that I had got Titian's range of colour quite as exactly as the old glasses had got Claude's. But it was extraordinarily difficult to get his vision of form. However, I was determined to su cceed; and, with infinite patience and after numberless attempts, success began slowly to come to me. To cut a long story short, I was able, in eight or ten years, to construct these four or five different sorts of glasses. Claude - glasses and Rossetti - gl asses, of course; and also Titian - glasses, Velasquez - glasses and Rembrandt - glasses; and again my mind came to anchor in the work accomplished. Not that I stopped thinking altogether; but that for some time my thoughts took no new flight, but hovered round and about the known. As soon as I had made the first pair of Rossetti - glasses, I began to teach my assistant, Williams, how to make them too, in order to put them before the public. We soon got a large sale for them. Chelsea, you know — old Chelsea, I me an — is almost peopled with artists, and many of them came about me and began to make my shop a rendezvous, where they met and brought their friends and talked; for Rossetti had a certain following, even in his own lifetime. But my real success came with th e Titian - glasses. The great Venetian's romantic view of life and beauty seemed to exercise an irresistible seduction upon every one, and the trade in his glasses soon became important. “My home life at this time was not as happy as it had been. In those long years of endless experiment, my daughters had grown up and married, and my wife, I suppose, widowed of her children, wanted more of my time and attention, just when I was taken away by my new work and began to give her"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 70 less. She used to complain at f irst; but, when she saw that complaints did not alter me, she retired into herself, as it were; and I saw less and less of her. And then, when my work was done and my new trade established, my shop, as I have told you, became the rendezvous for artists, a nd I grew interested in the frank, bright faces and the youthful, eager voice, and renewed my youth in the company of the young painters and writers who used to seek me out. Suddenly, I awoke to the fact that my wife was ill, very ill, and, almost before I had fully realised how weak she was, she died. The loss was greater than I would have believed possible. She was gentle and kind, and I missed her every day and every hour. I think that was the beginning of my dislike for the shop, the shop that had m ade me neglect her. The associations of it reminded me of my fault; the daily requirements of it grew irksome to me. “About this time, too, I began to miss Rossetti and the vivifying influences of his mind and talk. He went into the country a great deal and for long periods I did not see him, and, when at length we met, I found that the virtue was going out of him: he had become moody and irritable, a neuropath. Of course, the intellectual richness in him could not be hidden altogether: now and then, he would break out and talk in the old magical way: And conjure wonder out of emptiness, Till mean things put on beauty like a dress And all the world was an enchanted place. But, more often, he was gloomy and harassed, and it saddened and oppressed me to meet him. The young artists who came"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 71 to my shop did not fill his place; they chattered gaily enough, but none of them was a magician as he had been, and I began to realise that genius such as his is one of the rarest gifts in the world. “I am trying, w ith all brevity, to explain to you the causes of my melancholy and my dissatisfaction: but I don't think I have done it very convincingly; and yet, about this time, I had grown dissatisfied, ill at ease, restless. And once again my heart - emptiness drov e me to work and think. The next step forward came inevitably from the last one I had taken. “While studying the great painters, I had begun to notice that there was a certain quality common to all of them, a certain power they all possessed when working at highest pressure: the power of seeing things as they are — the vital and essential truth of things. I don't mean to say that all of them possessed this faculty to the same degree. Far from it. The truth of things to Titian is overlaid with romance: he is memorable mainly for his magic of colour and beauty; while Holbein is just as memorable for his grasp of reality. But compare Titian with Giorgione or Tintoretto, and you will see that his apprehension of the reality of things is much greater than theirs . It is that which distinguishes him from the other great colourists of Venice. And, as my own view of life grew sadder and clearer, it came to me gradually as a purpose that I should try to make glasses that would show the reality, the essential truth o f things, as all the great masters had seen it; and so I set to work again on a new quest. “About this time, I found out that, though I had many more customers in my shop, I had not made money out of my"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 72 artistic enterprises. My old trade as a spectacle - m aker was really the most profitable branch of my business. The sale of the Rossetti - glasses and the Titian - glasses, which at first had been very great, fell off quickly as the novelty passed away, and it was soon apparent that I had lost more than I had g ained by my artistic inventions. But whether I made £ 1500 a year, or £ 1000 a year, was a matter of indifference to me. I had doubled that cape of forty which to me marks the end of youth in a man, and my desires were shrinking as my years increased. As long as I had enough to satisfy my wants, I was not greedy of money. “This new - born desire of mine to make glasses which would show the vital truth of things soon began to possess me; and, gradually, I left the shop to take care of itself, left it in the hands of my assistant, Williams, and spent more and more time in the little workshop at the back, which had been the theatre of all my achievements. I could not tell you how long I worked at the problem; I only know that it cost me years and years, and tha t, as I gave more time and labour to it and more and more of the passion of my soul, so I came to love it more intensely and to think less of the ordinary business of life. At length, I began to live in a sort of dream, possessed by the one purpose. I us ed to get up at night and go on with the work and rest in the day. For months together, I scarcely ate anything, in the hope that hunger might sharpen my faculties; at another time, I lived almost wholly on coffee, hoping that this would have the same eff ect; and, at length, bit by bit, and slowly, I got nearer to the goal of my desire. But, when I reached it, when I had constructed glasses that would reveal the naked truth, show things as they were and men and"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 73 women as they were, I found that circumstanc es about me had changed lamentably. “In the midst of my work, I had known without realising it that Williams had left me and started a shop opposite, with the object of selling the artistic glasses, of which he declared himself the inventor; but I paid no attention to this at the time, and when, two or three years afterwards, I awoke again to the ordinary facts of life, I found that my business had almost deserted me. I am not sure, but I think it was a notice to pay some debts which I hadn't the money to pay, that first recalled me completely to the realities of everyday life. What irony there is in the world! Here was I, who had been labouring for years and years with the one object of making men see things as they are and men and women as they are, pe rsecuted now and undone by the same reality which I was trying to reveal. “My latest invention, too, was a commercial failure: the new glasses did not not sell at all. Nine people out of ten in England are truthblind, and could make nothing of the glasses; and the small minority, who have the sense of real things, kept complaining that the view of life which my glasses showed them, was not pleasant: as if that were any fault of mine. Williams, too, my assistant, did me a great deal of harm. He devoted him self merely to selling my spectacles; and the tradesman succeeded where the artist and thinker starved. As soon as he found out what my new glasses were, he began to treat me contemptuously; talked of me at times as a sort of half - madman, whose brain was turned by the importance given to his inventions; and at other times declared that I had never invented anything at all, for the idea"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 74 of the artistic glasses had been suggested by Rossetti. The young painters who frequented his shop took pleasure in sprea ding this legend and attributing to Rossetti what Rossetti would have been the first to disclaim. I found myself abandoned, and hours used to pass without any one coming into my shop. The worst of it was that, when chance gave me a customer, I soon lost him: the new glasses pleased no one. “At this point, I suppose, if I had been gifted with ordinary prudence, I should have begun to retrace my steps; but either we grow more obstinate as we grow older, or else the soul's passion grows by the sacrifices we make for it. Whatever the motives of my obstinacy may have been, the disappointment, the humiliation I went through seemed only to nerve me to a higher resolution. I knew I had done good work, and the disdain shown to me drove me in upon myself and my o wn thoughts.” *  *  *  *  * So much I learned from Mr. Penry in the first few days of our acquaintance, and then for weeks and weeks he did not tell me any more. He seemed to regard the rest of his story as too fantastic and improbable for belief , and he was nervously apprehensive lest he should turn me against him by telling it. Again and again, however, he hinted at further knowledge, more difficult experiments, a more arduous seeking, till my curiosity was all aflame, and I pressed him, perhap s unduly, for the whole truth. In those weeks of constant companionship, our friendship had grown with almost every meeting. It was impossible to escape the charm of Penry's personality! He was so absorbed in his work, so heedless of the ordinary vaniti es and greeds of"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 75 men, so simple and kindly and sympathetic, that I grew to love him. He had his little faults, of course, his little peculiarities; surface irritabilities of temper; moments of undue depression, in which he depreciated himself and his work ; moments of undue elation, in which he over - estimated the importance of what he had done. He would have struck most people as a little flighty and uncertain, I think; but his passionate devotion to his work lifted the soul, and his faults were, after all , insignificant in comparison with his noble and rare qualities. I had met no one in life who aroused the higher impulses in me as he did. It seemed probable that his latest experiments would be the most daring and the most instructive, and, accordingly, I pressed him to tell me about them with some insistence, and, after a time, he consented: “I don't know how it came about,” he began, “but the contempt of men for my researches exercised a certain influence on me, and at length I took myself seriously t o task: was there any reason for their disdain and dislike? Did these glasses of mine really show things as they are, or was I offering but a new caricature of truth, which people were justified in rejecting as unpleasant? I took up again my books on opt ics and studied the whole subject anew from the beginning. Even as I worked, a fear grew upon me: I felt that there was another height before me to climb, and that the last bit of the road would probably be the steepest of all. . . . In the Gospels,” he w ent on, in a low, reverent voice, “many things are symbolic and of universal application, and it alway seemed to me significant that the Hill of Calvary came at the end of the long journey. But I shrank from another prolonged effort; I said to myself that I couldn't face another task like the last."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 76 But, all the while, I had a sort of uncomfortable prescience that the hardest part of my life's work lay before me. “One day, a casual statement stirred me profoundly. The primary colours, you know, are red, yellow and blue. The colours shown in the rainbow vary from red to blue and violet; and the vibrations, or lengths, of the light - waves that give us violet grow shorter and shorter and, at length, give us red. “These vibrations can be measured. One day, quite by chance, I came across the statement that there were innumerable light - waves longer than those which give violet. At once the question sprang: were these longer waves represented by colours which we don't see, colours for which we have no name, col ours of which we can form no conception? And was the same thing true of the waves which, growing shorter and shorter, give us the sensation of red? There is room, of course, for myriads of colours beyond this other extremity of our vision. A little stud y convinced me that my guess was right; for all the colours which we see are represented to our sense of feeling in degrees of heat: that is, blue shows one reading on the thermometer and red a higher reading; and by means of this new standard, I discovere d that man's range of vision is not even placed in the middle of the register of heat, but occupies a little space far up towards the warmer extremity of it. There are thousands of degrees of cold lower than blue and hundreds of degrees of heat above red. All these gradations are doubtless represented by colours which no human eye can perceive, no human mind can imagine. It is with sight as with sound. We know now that there are noises louder than thunder which we cannot hear, the roar that lies on the other side of silence. We men are"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 77 poor restless prisoners, hemmed in by our senses as by the walls of a cell, hearing only a part of nature's orchestra and that part imperfectly; seeing only a thousandth part of the colour - marvels about us and seeing that infinitesimal part incorrectly and partially. Here was new knowledge with a vengeance! Knowledge that altered all my work! How was I to make glasses to show all this? Glasses that would reveal things as they are and must be to higher beings — the ultima te reality. At once, the new quest became the object of my life and, somehow or other I knew before I began the work that the little scraps of comfort or of happiness which I had preserved up to this time, I should now forfeit. I realised with shrinking and fear, that this new inquiry would still further remove me from the sympathy of my fellows. “My prevision was justified. I had hardly got well to work — that is, I had only spent a couple of years in vain and torturing experiments — when I was one day arre sted for debt. I had paid no attention to the writ; the day of trial came and went without my knowing anything about it; and there was a man in possession of my few belongings before I understood what was going on. Then I was taught by experience that to owe money is the one unforgivable sin in the nation of shopkeepers. My goods were sold up and I was brought to utter destitution” — the old man paused — “and then sent to prison because I could not pay.” “But,” I asked, “did your daughters do nothing? Surel y, they could have come to your help?” “Oh! they were more than kind,” he replied simply, “the eldest especially, perhaps because she was childless herself. I called her Gabrielle,” he added, lingering over the name; “she"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 78 was very good to me. As soon as she heard the news, she paid my debt and set me free. She bought things, too, and fitted out two nice rooms for me and arranged everything again quite comfortably; but you see,” he went on with a timid, depreciating smile, “I tired out even her patience: I could not work at anything that brought in money and I was continually spending money for my researches. The nice furniture went first; the pretty tables and chairs and then the bed. I should have wearied an angel. Again and again, Gabrielle bought me furniture and made me tidy and comfortable, as she said, and again and again, like a spendthrift boy, I threw it all away. How could I think of tables and chairs, when I was giving my life to my work? Besides, I always felt that the more I was plagued a nd punished, the more certain I was to get out the best in me: solitude and want are the twin nurses of the soul.” “But didn't you wish to get any recognition, any praise?” I broke in. “I knew by this time,” he answered, “that, in proportion as my work wa s excellent, I should find fewer to understand it. How many had I seen come to praise and honour while Rossetti fell to nerve - disease and madness; and yet his work endures and will endure, while theirs is already forgotten. The tree that grows to a great height wins to solitude even in a forest: its highest outshoots find no companions save the winds and stars. I tried to console myself with such similes as this,” he went on, with a deprecatory smile, “for the years passed and I seemed to come no nearer to success. At last, the way opened for me a little, and, after eight or ten years of incessant experiment, I found that partial success was all I"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 79 should ever accomplish. Listen! There is not one pair of eyes in a million that could ever see what I had taught myself to see, for the passion of the soul brings with it its own reward. After caring for nothing but truth for twenty years, thinking of nothing but truth, and wearying after it, I could see it more clearly than other men: get closer to it than they could. So the best part of my labour — I mean the highest result of it — became personal, entirely personal, and this disappointed me. If I could do no good to others by it, what was my labour but a personal gratification? And what was that to me — at my age! I seemed to lose heart, to lose zest. . . . Perhaps it was that old age had come upon me, that the original sum of energy in me had been spent, that my bolt was shot. It may be so. “The fact remains that I lost the desire to go on, and, when I ha d lost that, I woke up, of course, to the ordinary facts of life once again. I had no money: I was weak from semi - starvation and long vigils, prematurely old and decrepit. Once more, Gabrielle came to my assistance. She fitted up this room, and then I w ent out to sell my glass, as a pedlar. I bought the tray and made specimens of all the spectacles I had made, and hawked them about the streets. Why shouldn't I? No work is degrading to the spirit, none, and I could not be a burden to the one I loved, n ow I knew that my best efforts would not benefit others. I did not get along very well: the world seemed strange to me, and men a little rough and hard. Besides, the police seemed to hate me; I don't know why. Perhaps, because I was poor, and yet unlike the poor they knew. They persecuted me, and the magistrates before whom they brought me always believed them and"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 80 never believed me. I have been punished times without number for obstruction, though I never annoyed any one. The police never pretended tha t I had cheated or stolen from any one before; but, after all, this latest charge of theirs brought me to know you and gave me your friendship; and so I feel that all the shame has been more than made up to me.” My heart burned within me as he spoke so gen tly of his unmerited sufferings. I told him I was proud of being able to help him. He put his hand on mine with a little smile of comprehension. A day or two later curiosity awoke in me again, and I asked him to let me see a pair of the new glasses, thos e that show the ultimate truth of things. “Perhaps, some day,” he answered quietly. I suppose my face fell, for, after a while, he went on meditatively: “There are faults in them, you see, shortcomings and faults in you, too, my friend.

Perhaps the truth of things is not for man.” *  *  *  *  * When we entered the court on the day of Penry's trial, Morris and myself were of opinion that the case would not last long and that it would certainly be decided in our favour. The only person who seemed at all doubtful of the issue was Penry himself. He smiled at me, half pityingly, when I told him t hat in an hour we should be on our way home. The waiting seemed interminable, but at length the case was called. The counsel for the prosecution got up and talked perfunctorily for"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 81 five minutes, with a sort of careless unconcern that seemed to me callous and unfeeling. Then he began to call his witnesses. The workman, I noticed, was not in the court. His evidence had been rather in favour of the accused, and the prosecution, on that account, left it out. But Mr. 'Allett, as he called himself, of 'Igh 'Olborn, was even more voluble and vindictive than he had been at the police - court. He had had time to strengthen his evidence, too, to make it more bitter and more telling, and he had used his leisure malignantly. It seemed to me that every one should h ave seen his spite and understood the vileness of his motives. But no; again and again, the judge emphasised those parts of his story which seemed to tell most against the accused. The judge was evidently determined that the jury should not miss any deta il of the accusation, and his own bias appeared to me iniquitous. But there was a worse surprise in store for us. After Hallett, the prosecution called a canon of Westminster, a stout man, with heavy jowl and loose, suasive lips, Canon Bayton. He told u s how he had grown interested in Penry and in his work, and how he had bought all his earlier glasses, the Rossetti - glasses, as he called them. The cannon declared that these artistic glasses threw a very valuable light on things, redeemed the coarseness and commonness of life and made reality beautiful and charming. He was not afraid to say that he regarded them as instruments for good; but the truth - revealing glasses seemed to excite his utmost hatred and indignation. He could not find a good word to s ay for them: they only showed, he said, what was terrible and brutal in life. When looking through them, all beauty vanished, the charming flesh - covering fell away and you saw the death's - head grinning at you. Instead of parental affection, you found"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 82 pers onal vanity; instead of the tenderness of the husband for the wife, gross and common sensuality. All high motives withered, and, instead of the flowers of life, you were compelled to look at the wormlike roots and the clinging dirt. He concluded his evid ence by assuring the jury that they would be doing a good thing if they put an end to the sale of such glasses. The commerce was worse than fraudulent, he declared; it was a blasphemy against God and an outrage on human nature. The unctuous canon seemed to me worse than all the rest; but the effect he had on the jury was unmistakable, and our barrister, Symonds, refused to cross - examine him. To do so, he said, would only strengthen the case for the prosecution, and I have no doubt that he was right, for Morris agreed with him. But even the prosecuting witnesses did not hurt us more than the witnesses for the defence. Mr. Penry had been advised by Mr. Morris to call witnesses to his character, and he had called half a dozen of the most respectable trades men of his acquaintance. One and all did him harm rather than good; they all spoke of having known him twenty years before, when he was well - to - do and respectable. They laid stress upon what they called “his fall in life.” They all seemed to think that he had neglected his business and come to ruin by his own fault. No one of them had the faintest understanding of the man, or of his work. It was manifest from the beginning that these witnesses damaged our case, and this was apparently the view of the p rosecuting barrister, for he scarcely took the trouble to cross - examine them. It was with a sigh of relief that I saw Mr. Penry go into the box to give evidence on his own behalf. Now, I thought, the"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 83 truth will come to light. He stated everything with the utmost clearness and precision; but no one seemed to believe him. The wish to understand him was manifestly wanting in the jury, and from the beginning the judge took sides against him. From time to time, he interrupted him just to bring out what he reg arded as the manifest falseness of his testimony. “You say that these glasses show truth,” he said. “Who wants to see truth?” “Very few,” was Penry's reply. “Why, then, did you make the glasses,” went on the judge, “if you knew that they would disappoin t people?” “I thought it my duty to,” replied Penry. “Your duty to disappoint and anger people?” retorted the judge, “a strange view to take of duty. And you got money for this unpleasant duty, didn't you?” “A little,” was Penry's reply. “Yes; but still you got money,” persisted the judge. “You persuaded people to buy your glasses, knowing that they would be disappointed in them, and you induced them to give you money for the disappointment. Have you anything else to urge in your defence?” I was at my wit's end; I scarcely knew how to keep quiet in my seat. It seemed to me so easy to see the truth. But even Penry seemed indifferent to the result, indifferent to a degree that I could scarcely explain or excuse. This last question, however, of the jud ge aroused him. As the harsh, contemptuous words fell upon the ear, he leaned forward, and, selecting a pair of spectacles, put them on and peered round the court. I noticed that he was slightly flushed. In a"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 84 moment or two, he took the glasses off and turned to the judge: “My lord,” he said, “you seem determined to condemn me, but, if you do condemn me, I want you to do it with some understanding of the facts. I have told you that there are very few persons in this country who have any faculty for tru th, and that the few who have, usually have ruined their power before they reach manhood. You scoff and sneer at what I say, but still it remains the simple truth. I looked round the court just now to see if there was any one here young enough, ingenuous enough, pure enough, to give evidence on my behalf. I find that there is no one in the court to whom I can appeal with any hope of success. But, my lord, in the room behind this court there is a child sitting, a girl with fair hair, probably your lordshi p's daughter. Allow me to call her as a witness, allow her to test the glasses and say what she sees through them, and then you will find that these glasses do alter and change things in a surprising way to those who can use them.” “I don't know how you k new it,” broke in the judge, “but my daughter is in my room waiting for me, and what you say seems to have some sense in it. But it is entirely unusual to call a child, and I don't know that I have any right to allow it. Still, I don't want you to feel t hat you have not had every opportunity of clearing yourself; so, if the jury consent, I am quite willing that they should hear what this new witness may have to say.” “We are willing to hear the witness,” said the foreman, “but really, your lordship, our m inds are made up about the case.”"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC GLASSES 85 The next moment, the child came into the court — a girl of thirteen or fourteen, with a bright, intelligent face, a sort of shy fear troubling the directness of her approach. “I want you to look through a pair of spectacles , my child,” said Penry to her, “and tell us just what you see through them,” and, as he spoke, he peered at her in his strange way, as if judging her eyes. He then selected a pair of glasses and handed them to her. The child put them on and looked round the court, and then cried out suddenly: “Oh, what strange people; and how ugly they all are. All ugly, except you who gave me the glasses; you are beautiful.” Turning hastily round, she looked at her father and added, “Oh, papa, you are — Oh!” and she t ook off the glasses quickly while a burning flush spread over her face. “I don't like these glasses,” she said indignantly, laying them down. “They are horrid! My father doesn't look like that.” “My child,” said Penry, very gently, “will you look throug h another pair of glasses? You see so much that perhaps you can see what is to be, as well as what is. Perhaps you can catch some glimpse even of the future.” He selected another pair and handed them to the child. There was a hush of expectancy in the c ourt; people who had scoffed at Penry before and smiled contempt, now leaned forward to hear, as if something extraordinary were about to happen. All eyes were riveted on the little girl's face; every ear strained to hear what she would say. Round and ro und the court she looked through the strange glasses and then began to speak in a sort of frightened monotone:"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 86 “I see nothing,” she said. “I mean there is no court and no people, only great white blocks, a sort of bluey - white.

It is all cold, all dead.” In a frightened voice she added: “Is that the future?” Penry leaned towards her eagerly: “Look at the ligh t, child,” he said; “follow the light up and tell us what you see.” Again a strange hush; I heard my heart thumping while the child looked about her. Then, pulling off the glasses, she said peevishly: “I can't see anything more: it hurts my eyes.” *  *  *  *  * D EATH IN P RISON . “Matthew Penry, whose trial for fraud and condemnation will probably still be remembered by our readers because of the very impressive evidence for the prosectuion given by Canon Bayton, of Westminster, died, we understan d, in Wandsworth Prison yesterday morning from syncope.” — Extract from the Times , January 3 , 1900 .

He slayeth Sir Amorex le Desirous. These plants did our brother Perardua pluck, as the mystic rites ordain; and these did he heat furiously in his alembic, yet with vegetable heat alone, while he kept them ever moist, dropping upon them of his luna r water, whereof he had three and seventy minims left of the eight and seventy that his Father had given him; and these he had borne upon a camel through the desert unto this place where he now was, which is called the Oasis of the Lion, even as the whole Regimen that in the end he accomplished is in the form of a Lion. Thus then his Lion waxed exceeding thirsty, and licked up all that dew. But the fire being equal thereunto, he was not discomforted. He slayeth Sir Lionel the Warder of the Marches. So now indeed he had wrought the first Matter to a pitch of excellence beyond the human; for without trouble was his tincture thus beautiful.

Therefore he subtly prepared a Red Dragon, or as some alchemists will have it, a Fiery Flying Serpe nt, whereby he should eat up that Sphinx of his, that he had nourished with such ingenium and care. Now this Red Dragon hath seven fiery coils, proper to the seven silver stars. Also was his head right venemous and greedy, and eight flames were about it; for that Sphinx had two wings and four feet and two horns; but the Serpent is one, even as the King is one.

Hers was a curious mission, to serve the envy of the long lank melancholy unwashed poet whom she loved. Will Bute was not only a poetaster but a dabbler in magic, and black jealousy of a younger man and a far finer poet gnawed at his petty heart. He had gained a subtle hypnotic influence over Hypat ia, who helped him in his ceremonies, and he had now commissioned her to seek out his rival and pick up some magical link through which he might be destroyed. The door opened, and the girl passed from the cold stone dusk of the stairs to a palace of rose and gold. The poet's rooms were austere in their elegance. A plain gold - black paper of Japan covered the walls; in the midst hung an ancient silver lamp within which glowed the deep ruby of an electric lamp. The floor was covered with black and gold of leopards' skins; on the walls hung a great crucifix in ivory and ebony. Before the blazing fire lay the poet (who had concealed his royal Celtic descent beneath the pseudonym of Swanoff) reading in a great volume bound with vellum. He rose to greet her. “Many days have I expected you,” he exclaimed, “many days have I wept over you.

In the dim twilight he could see the lovely face that kissed him with lips of infinite splendour, hear the cooing words of love. “Kill it! My God! Adonai !

This true sceptic is indeed the man of science; as Wells’ “Moreau” tells us. He has devised some means of answering his first question, and its answer is another question. It is difficult to conceive of any question, indeed, whose answer does not imply a thousand further questions. So simple an inquiry as “Why is sugar sweet?” involves an infinity of chemical researches, each leading ultimately to the blank wall — what is matter? and an infinity of physiological researches, each (similarly) leading to the blank wall — what is mind?

Descartes supposed himself to have touched bed - rock with his Cogito, ergo Sum . Huxley pointed out the complex nature of this proposition, and that it was an enthymeme with the premiss Omnes sunt, qui cogitant suppressed. He reduced it to Cogito ; or, to avoid the assumption of an ego, Cogitatur . Examining more c losely this statement, we may still cavil at its form. We cannot translate it into English without the use of the verb to be, so, that, after all, existence is implied.

It may be possible for a sane man; but I should like to know more about his mind before I give a final opinion. But apart from purely formal objections, we may still inquire: Is this Cogitatur true? Yes; reply the sages; for to deny it implies thought. Negatur is only a sub - section of Cogitatur . This involves, however, an axiom that the part is of the same nature as the whole; or (at th e very least) an axiom that A is A. Now, I do not wish to deny that A is A , or may occasionally be A . But certainly A is A is a very different statement to our original Cogitatur . The proof of Cogitatur , in short, rests not upon itself but upon the validi ty of our logic; and if by logic we mean (as we should mean) the Code of the Laws of Thought, the irritating sceptic will have many more remarks to make: for it now appears that the proof that thought exists depends upon the truth of that which is thought, to say no more. We have taken Cogitatur , to try and avoid the use of esse , but A is A involves that very idea, and the proof is fatally flawed. Cogitatur depends on Est ; and there’s no avoiding it.

The most profound meditation only leads to an exasperating sense of impotence. There is, it seems, no simple rational idea in the mind which corresponds to the word. It is easy of course to drown the question in definitions, leading us to further complexity — but “Existence is the gift of Divine Providence,” “Existence is the opposite of Non - Existence,” do not help us much! The plain Existe nce is Existence of the Hebrews goes further. It is the most sceptical of statements, in spite of its form. Existence is just existence, and there’s no more to be said about it; don’t worry! Ah, but there is more to be said about it! Though we search o urselves for a thought to match the word, and fail, yet we have Berkeley’s perfectly convincing argument that (so far as we know it) existence must mean thinking existence or spiritual existence . Here then we find our Est to imply Cogitatur ; and Berkeley’s arguments are “irrefragable, yet fail to produce conviction” (Hume) because the Cogitatur , as we have shown, implies Est . Neither of these ideas is simple; each involves the other. Is the division between them in our brain a proof of the total incapacity of that organ, or is there some flaw in our logic?

We compass heaven and earth to make one syllogism; and when we have made it, it is tenfold more the child of mystery than ourselves. We cannot here discuss the whole problem of the validity (the surface - question of the logical validity) of the syllogism; though one may throw out the hint that the doctrine of distributed middle seems to assume a knowledge of a Calculus of Infinites which is certainly beyond my own poor attainments, and hardly impregnable to the simple reflection that all mathematics is conventional, and not essential; relative, and not absolute.

The Christian insists on notorious lies being accepted as an essential part of his (more usually her) system; I, on the contrary, ask for facts, for obse rvation. Under Scepticism, true, one is just as much a house of cards as the other; but only in the philosophical sense. Practically, Science is true; and Faith is foolish. Practically, 3 × 1 = 3 is the truth; and 3 × 1 = 1 is a lie; though, sceptically, both statements may be false or unintelligible.

Practically, “I concentrated my mind upon a white radiant triangle in whose centre was a shining eye, for 22 minutes and 10 seconds, my attention wandering 45 times” is a scientific and valuable statement. “I pray ed fervently to the Lord for the space of many days” means anything or nothing. Anybody who cares to do so may imitate my experiment and compare his result with mine.

There is no distinction whatever; I might easily put the boots on his shoulders, with his head on one foot and his hat on the other. In short, why not be a clean - living Irish gentleman, even if you do have insane ideas about the universe? Very good, say my friends, unabashed, then why not stick to that?

Consequently he goes about contradicting Malkuth; he refuses to allow Malkuth to ob sess his thought. He keeps on crying out that there is no difference between a goat and a God, in the hope of hypnotising himself (as it were) into that perception of their identity, which is his (partial and incorrect) idea of how things look from Kethe r.

Buddha thought the supply of hunchbacks infinite; but why should not the soldiers themselves be infinite in number? However that may be, here is the point; it takes a moment for a hunchback to kill his man, and the further we get from our base the longer it takes. You may crumble to ashes the dream - world of a boy, as it were, between your fingers; but before you can bring the physical universe tumbling about a man’s e ars he requires to drill his hunchbacks so devilish well that they are terribly like soldiers themselves. And a question capable of shaking the consciousness of Samadhi could, I imagine, give long odds to one of Frederick’s grenadiers. It is useless to at tack the mystic by asking him if he is quite sure Samadhi is good for his poor health; ’tis like asking the huntsman to be very careful, please, not to hurt the fox. The ultimate Question, the one that really knocks Samadhi to pieces, is such a stupendous Idea that it is far more of a ! than all previous !’s together, for all its ? form. And the name of that Question is Nibbana. Take this matter of the soul. When Mr. Judas McCabbage asks the Man in the Street why he believes in a soul, the Man stammers out that he has always heard so; naturally McCabbage has no difficulty in proving to him by biological methods that he has no soul; and with a sunny smile each passes on his way.

Now the ideas of McCabbage are banal and dull; those of Hume are live and virile; there is a joy in them greater than the joy of the Man in the Street. So too the Buddha - thought, Anatta, is a more splendid conception than the philosopher’s Dutch - doll - like Eg o, or the rational artillery of Hume. This weapon, too, that has destroyed our lesser, our illusionary universes, ever revealing one more real, shall we not wield it with divine ecstasy?

What is to be done? How shall such mysteries be uttered? Is this how it is that the true Path of the Wise is said to lie in a totally different plane from all his advance in the path of Knowledge, and of Trance? We have al ready been obliged to take the Fourth Dimension to illustrate (if not explain) the nature of Samadhi. Ah, say the adepts, Samadhi is not the end, but the beginning. You must regard Samadhi as the normal state of mind which enables you to begin your resear ches, just as waking is the state from which you rise to Samadhi, sleep the state from which you rose to waking. And only from Sammasamadhi — continuous trance of the right kind — can you rise up as it were on tiptoe and peer through the clouds unto the mount ains. Now of course it is really awfully decent of the adepts to take all that trouble over us, and to put it so nicely and clearly.

Why bother to swing? First, because you’re bound to swing, whether you like it or not; second, because your attention is thereby distracted from those lumbar muscles in which the hook is so very firmly fixed; third, because after all it’s a ripping good game; fourth, because you want to get on, and even to seem to progre ss is better than standing still. A treadmill is admittedly good exercise. True, the question, “Why become an Arahat?” should precede, “How become an Arahat?” but an unbiassed man will easily cancel the first question with “Why not?” — the How is not so eas y to get rid of.

In any case, we are wasting our time — we are as ridiculous with or Arahats as Herod t he Tetrarch with his peacocks!

Even to - day, though many thousand years after they were first written down, we find a greater simplicity and truth in the ancient rituals and hymns of Egypt and Assyria than in the extraordinary entanglement of systems that came to life during the first five hundred years of Christian era. And in the East, from the most remote antiquity to the present day, scientific systems of illuminism have been in daily practice from the highest to the lowest in the land; though, as we consider, much corrupted by an ignorant priestcraft, by absurd superstiti ons and by a science which fell to a divine revelation in place of rising to a sublime art. In the West, for some fifteen hundred years now, Chris - tianity has swayed the minds of men from the Arctic seas to the Mediterranean.

Still, by him who h as eyes will it be seen that through all this darkness there shone the glamour of a great and beautiful Truth. Little is it to be wondered then, in these present shallow intellectual days, that almost any one who has studied, or even heard of, the theori es of any notorious nobody of the moment at once relegates to the museum or the waste - paper basket these theories and systems, which were once the very blood of the world, and which in truth are so still, though few suspect it.

To start from the beginning would appear the proper course to ad opt; but if we commence sifting the shingle from the sand with the year 10 , 000 B.C. there is little likelihood of our ever arriving within measurable distance of the present day. Fortunately, however, for us, we need not start with any period anterior to our own, or upon any subject outside of our own true selves. But two things we must learn, if we are ever to make ourselves intelligible to others, and these are, firstly an alphabet, and secondly a language whereby to express our thoughts; for without so me definite system of expression our only course is to remain silent, lest further confusion be added to the already bewildering chaos."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 146 It will be at once said by any one who has read as far as this: “I lay you whatever odds you name that the writer of th is book will prove to be the first offender!” And with all humility will we at once plead guilty to this offence.

In a hospital a chart is usually kept for each patient, upon which may be seen the exact p rogress, from its very commence - ment, of the case in question.

Now, even to such as are still mere students in the mysteries, it must have become apparent that there are moments in the lives of others, if not in their own, which bring with them an enormous sense of inner authority and illumination; moments which created epochs in our lives, and which, when they have gone, stand out as luminous peaks in the moonlight of the past. Sad to say, they come but seldom, so seldom that often they are looked back upon as miraculous visitations of some vastly higher power beyond and outside of ourselves. But when they do come the greatest joys of earth wither before them like dried leaves in the fire, and fade from the firmament of our minds as the stars of night before the rising sun. Now, if it were possible to induce these states of ecstasy or hallucination, or whatever we care to call them, at will, so to speak, we should have accomplished what was once called, and what is still known as, the Great Work, and have discovered the Stone of the Wise, that universal dissolvent.

Now when St. John of the Cross tells us that a single vision of God may reward us for all the labours of this life, we are at perfect liberty, in these tolerant days, to cry “Yea!” or “Nay!” We may go further: we may extol St. John to the position of a second George Washington, or we may call him “a damned liar!” or, again, if we do not wish to be considered rude, a “neur opath,” or some other equally amiable synonym.

I think I can easily make clear what I mean by these words. “The world of our experience consists at all times of two pa rts, an objective and a subjective part, of which the former may be incalculably more extensive than the latter, and yet the latter can never be omitted or suppressed. The objective part is the sum total of whatsoever at any given time we may be thinking of, the subjective part is the inner ‘state' in which the thinking comes to pass. What we think of may be enormous — the cosmic times and spaces, for example — whereas the inner state may be the most fugitive and paltry activity of mind. Yet the cosmic objec ts, so far as the experience yields them, are but ideal pictures of something whose existence we do not inwardly possess, but only point at outwardly, while the inner state is our very experience itself; its reality and that of our experience are one. A c onscious field plus its object as felt or thought of plus an attitude towards the object plus the sense of a self to whom the attitude belongs — such a concrete bit of personal experience may be a small bit, but it is a solid bit as long as it lasts; not hol low, not a mere abstract element of experience, such as the ‘object' is when taken all alone. It is a full fact, even though it be an insignificant fact; it is of the kind to which all realities whatsoever must belong; the motor currents of the world run through the like of it; it is on the line connecting real events with real events. That unshareable feeling which each one of us has of the pinch of his individual destiny as he privately feels it rolling out on fortune's wheel may be disparaged for its e gotism, may be sneered at as unscientific, but it is the one thing that fills up the measure of our concrete actuality,"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 155 and any would - be existence that should lack such a feeling, or its analogue, would be a piece of reality only half made up. “If this b e true, it is absurd for science to say that the egotistic elements of experience should be suppressed. The axis of reality runs solely through the egotistic places — they are strung upon it like so many beads. To describe the world with all the various f eelings of the individual pinch of destiny, all the various spiritual attitudes, left out from the description — they being as describable as anything else — would be something like offering a printed bill of fare as the equivalent for a solid meal. Religion makes no such blunders. . . . A bill of fare with one real raisin on it instead of the word ‘raisin' and one real egg instead of the word ‘egg' might be an inadequate meal, but it would at least be a commencement of reality.

Shortly after this he became acquainted with a certain brother of the Order of A ∴ A ∴ ; and himself a little later became an initiate in the first grade of that Order.

According to the “British Pharmacopeia” the dose is ¼ to 1 grain. The Lancet vol. i, page 1042 ( 1908 ), records two interesting cases of toxic symptoms caused by taking overdoses of the tincture. Antidotes for Cannabis poisoning are the stomach - pump or emetics followed by stimulating draughts of brandy and water or strong coffee, vegetable acids, such as lemon juice or vinegar.

C . S ., F . L . S . Although “charas” has been properly described as “a foul and crude drug, the use of which is properly excluded from civilised medicine,” it is imported into British India to the value of £ 120 , 000 per annum, a total exceeding the combined value of all the other medicinal imports, so that it is an article which deserves more than passing notice. In dian hemp (Cannabis Sativa), when grown in the East, secretes an intoxicating resinous matter on the upper leaves and flower - ing spikes, the exudation being marked in plants growing throughout the Western Himalayas and Turkestan, where charas is prepared a s a commercial article. Formerly it was cultivated in fields in Turkestan, but now it is grown as a border around other crops (such as maize), the seeds of both being sown at the same time. A sticky exudation (white when damp and greyish when dry) is fo und on the upper parts of the plant before the flowers show, and in April and May, when the plants attain a height of 4 or 5 ft. and the seeds ripen, the Cannabis is gathered, after reaping the crops, and stored in a cool, dry place. When dry the powdery resinous substance can be detached by even slight shaking, the dust being collected on a cloth. In some districts the plants are cut close to the roots, suspended head downwards, and the dust or gard shaken from them and collected on sheets placed on the floor. The leaves, seeds, etc., are picked out, and sand, etc., separated by passing through a fine sieve, the powder being collected and stored in cloth or skin bags, when it is ready for export. In some villages the charas or"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 236 extract is made up into small balls, which are collected by the middleman. On reaching British territory all charas is weighed before the nearest magistrate, by whom it is sealed, a certificate of weight swigned by the Deputy Commissioner being given to the owner. The trader, be fore leaving the district, obtains a permit allowing him to take the drug to a special market. The zamindars of Chinese Turkestan are the vendors of the drug, the importers being Yarkhandis or Ladakhis, who dis - pose of it at Hoshiapur and Amritsar princi pally, returning with piece - goods, or Amritsar merchants who trade with Ladakh. The drug in this way reaches the chief cities of the Punjab during September and October. Thence it is dis - tributed over the Central and United Provinces as far as Bombay and C alcutta, and is used everywhere for smoking. Charas, though a drug, plays the part of money to a great extent in the trade that is carried on at Ladakh, the price of the drug depending on the state of the market, and any fluctuations causing a correspondin g increase or decrease in the value of the goods for which it is bartered. The exchange price of charas thus gives rise to much gambling. A pony - load (two pais or three maunds) sells for Rs. 40 or Rs. 50 , the cost of transport to Hoshiapur (the chief P unjab depot) is Rs. 100 , and there it fetches from Rs. 30 to Rs. 100 per maund. Retail dealers sell small quantities at a price that works out at Rs. 200 to Rs. 500 per maund. Five years ago the Kashgar growers, encouraged by the high prices, sowed a la rge crop and reaped a bumper harvest, only to find the market already overstocked and prices on the Leh Exchange fallen from Rs. 60 to RS. 30 per maund.

Samples of Baluchistan charas made in the Sarawan division of the Kalat State have been sent to the Indian Museum by Mr. Hughes - Buller. The following is the mode of preparation. “The female ‘bhang’ plants are reaped when they are waist high and charged with seed. The leaves and seeds are separated and half dried. They are then spread on a carpet made of goat's hair, another carpet is spread over them and slightly rubbed. The dust containing the narcotic principle falls off, and the leaves , etc., are removed to another carpet and again rubbed. The first dust is the best quality, and is known as nup; the dust from the second shaking is called tahgalim, and is of inferior quality. A third shaking gives gania, of still lower quality. Each k ind of dust is made unto small balls called gabza, and kept in cloth bags. The first quality is recognised by the ease with which it melts.” The local rates per tola are: for first quality 2 a. 5 p., second quality 1 a. 7 p., and third quality 11 p.

No charas is made in the plains of India, except a small quantity in Gwalior, the Bengal ganja yielding no charas in all the handling it undergoes in the process of perparation — thus emphasising the fact that the intoxicat - ing secretion is developed in plants growing where the altitude and climate are suitable, as in the Himalayas and Turkestan. Adulterations. — Aitchison in 1874 stated that no charas of really good quality ever came to Leh, the best charas in the original balls being sent to Bokhara and Kokan. He said the chief adulterant is the mealy covering of the fruits of the wild and cultivated Trebizond date ( Eloeagnus hortensis ). The impression in the United Provinces and the Punjab is that the Ya rkhand drug is sophisticated, and a preference is given in some quarters to the Nepal and other Himalayan forms, which command a higher price. The Special Assistant in Kashgar declares there is no advantage in increasing the weight, as when dealers in Ind ia buy the drug they test it, otherwise they would pay a heavy duty on the adulterant as well as on the charas itself; so no exporter at present would spoil his charas by adding extraneous substances.

Professor Greenish in his well - known work on Materia Medica says the Cannabis Indica is an annual dioecious herb indigenous to C entral and Western Asia, but largely cultivated in temperate countries for its strong fibres (hemp) and its oily seed (hemp - seed) and in tropical countries also for the resinous secretions which it there produces. The secretion possesses very valuable and powerful medicinal properties; but it is not produced in the plant when grown in temperate climates; on the other hand the fibre of the plant under the latter condition is much stronger than that of the tropical plant. The hemp plant grown in India differs , however, in certain"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"A PHARMACEUTICAL STUDY 241 particulars from that grown in Europe; and the plant was formerly considered a distinct species and named Cannabis Indica, but this opinion is now abandoned. The cultivation of hemp for its seed and fibre dates from very remote period s. It was used as an intoxicant by the Persians and Arabians in the eleventh and twelfth centuries and probably much earlier, but was not introduced into European medicine until the year 1838 . For medicinal use it is grown in the districts of Bogra and Raj shaki to the North of Calcutta and westward, thence through central India to Gujerat. Very good qualities of the drug are purchased in Madras, but the European market is chiefly supplied with inferior grades from Ghalapur. The pistillate plants by which al one the resin is secreted in any quantity are pruned to produce flowering branches, the tops of these flowering branches are collected, allowed to wilt, and then pressed by treading them under the feet into more or less compact masses. This forms the drug known as “ganjah,” or (on the London market) Guaza. The larger leaves are collected separately; when dried they are known as “bhang.” During the manipulations to which the plant is subjected in preparing the drug, a certain quantity of the resin is separa ted; it is collected and forms the drug known as “charas” (Churrus). Charas is also prepared by rubbing ganjah between the hands or by men in leather garments brushing against the growing plants, in any case separating part of the active adhesive resin; hence the official description limits the drug to that from which the resin has not been removed."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 242 All these forms of the drug are largely used in India for producing an agreeable form of intoxication; ganjah and charas are smoked, while bhang is used to pr epare a drink or sweetmeat. The drug has a powerful odour, but is almost devoid of taste. Numerous attempts have been made to isolate the active constituent of Indian hemp; it is not possible here to do more than allude to the chief late ones. In 1881 Sieb old and Bradbury isolated a thick yellowish oily liquid which they termed Cannabinine and their results were confirmed in 1884 by Warden and Waddell. In 1894 Robert separated a dark red syrupy mass possessing intoxicating properties and in 1896 Wood, Spive y, and Easterfield obtained from charas under reduced pressure certain inactive terpenes and a viscous resin Cannabinol which when warmed melts to an oily liquid. Cannabinol when taken internally induces delirium and sleep, and, as far as at present known, is the intoxicating constituent of Indian hemp. In addition to this principle Matthew Hay in 1883 obtained colourless crystals of an alkaloid tetano - cannabine which in physiological action resembled strychnine. Cannabis Indica was formerly used as a hypno tic and anodyne but is uncertain in its action. It is administered in mania and hysteria as an anodyne and antispasmodic. Mr. E. M. Holmes, F.L.S., Curator of the Pharmaceutical Society's Museum, writing on the subject of Cannabis Indica says “The Dervishe s make a preparation by macerating the resinous type in almond oil and give a small quantity of it in soup to produced prolonged sleep.”"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"A PHARMACEUTICAL STUDY 243 A strong dose of Cannabis produces curious hallucinations abolishing temporarily the ideas of time and distance; but th e ordinary drug as imported is never the current crop, which the Hindoos keep for their own use. The active principle Cannabinol (as far as is known) rapidly oxidises and loses its properties so that if a really active preparation is required, it is best to get it made in India, using absolute alcohol and the fresh tops, or recently made charas, which, being a solid mass, does not readily oxidise. Before closing it might be well to notice in detail the final investigations made by Messrs. Wood, Spivey, and Easterfield. The following is re - printed from the “Proceedings of the Chemical Society” for 1897 - 8 , and is to be found on page 66 . CANNABINOL “The Authors have continued their examination of Cannabinol, the toxic resinous constituent of Indian Hemp (Tra ns. 1896 , 69 , 539 ). “The substance boils with slight decomposition at about 400 ° its absorption spectrum shows no characteristic bands, its vapour - density at the temperature of boiling Sulphur corresponds with the formula C 18 H 24 O 2 already assigned to the c ompound. “An account is given of the reaction of Cannabinol with Acetic Anhydride, benzoyl Chloride and phosphoric Anhy - dride; the results indicate that one hydroxyl group is present.

The Authors assign the formula C 15 H 18 O 2 to this compound. The same compound has recently been described by Dunstan and Henry (Proc. 1898 , 14 , 44 , Feb. 17 ), who ascribe the formula C 18 H 22 O Ac to it, fuming hydriodic Acid gives no methyl or ethyl iodide when boiled with Cannabinol. Reduction with hydrodic Acid in sealed tubes produces a hydro - carbon, C 10 H 20 . “By long boiling with or without dehydrating agents a hydro - carbon C 10 H 16 is formed. “Oxidation with aqueous chromic acid, alkaline or acid permanganate or dilute nitric acid is accompanied by the production of a caproic acid, lower fatty acids being probably produced at the same time. The action of fuming nitric acid upon cannabinol diss olved in cold glacial acetic acid removes one carbon atom as carbonic anhydride, and produces a red amorphous substance which gives numbers on analysis agreeing with the formula C 17 H 20 N 2 O 6 . “This substance when boiled with nitric acid yields a light - red su bstance C 17 H 20 N 2 O 8 which upon further oxidation yields among other substances a yellow acid crystalline compound C 13 H 15 N 2 O 5 , which forms sparingly soluble crystalline sodium, ammonium and silver salts and is probably a dinitrophenol, and a compound C 11 H 11 N O 4 , the properties of which agree closely with those of the oxycannabin of Bolas and Francis ( Chemical News 1871 , 24 , 77 ). “This compound has the properties of a nitro - lactone, as has already been shown by Dunstan and Henry. “Corresponding crystalline pota ssium and silver Salts have been prepared and analysed.

Nitrocannabinolactonic acid is obtained by oxidising oxycann - abin either by nitric acid in sealed tubes or by potassium perm anganate.

The method of as say, which has previously been called to the attention of this Society, is that which one of us (Houghton) devised and has employed for the past twelve years. This method consists essentially in the careful observation of the physiological effects produce d upon dogs from the internal administration of the preparation of the drug under test. It is necessary in selecting the test animals to pick out those that are easily susceptible to the action of the Cannabis, since dogs as well as human beings vary cons iderably in their reaction to the drug. Also, preliminary tests should be made upon the animals before they are finally selected for test purposes, in order that we may know exactly how they behave under given conditions. After the animals have been fina lly selected and found to respond to the standard test dose, 0 . 01 Gm. per kilo, they are set aside for this particular work, care being taken to have them well fed, well housed, and in every way kept under the best sanitary conditions. Usually we have fou nd it desirable to keep two or more of the approved animals on hand at all times, so there may not be delay in testing samples as they come in. In applying the test, the standard dose (in form of solid extract for convenience) is administered internally in a small capsule. The dog's tongue is drawn forward between the teeth with the left hand and the capsule placed on the back part of the tongue with the right hand. The tongue is then quickly released and the capsule is swallowed with ease. In order that the drug may be rapidly absorbed, food should be"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"A PHARMACEUTICAL STUDY 247 withheld for twenty - four hours before the test and an efficient cathartic given if needed. Within a comparatively short time the dog begins to show the characteristic action of the drug. There are three typ ical effects to be noticed from active extracts on susceptible animals: first a stage excitability, then a stage of inco - ordination, followed by a period of drowsiness. The first of these is so dependent on the characteristics of the dog used that it is o f little value for judging the activity of the drug, while with only a few exceptions the second, or the stage of inco - ordination, invariably follows in one or two hours; the dog loses control of its legs and of the muscles supporting its head, so that wh en nothing occurs to attract its attention its head will droop, its body sway, and, when severely affected, the animal will stagger and fall, the intoxication being peculiarly suggestive and striking. Experience is necessary on the part of the observer to determine just when the physiological effects of the drug begin to manifest themselves, since there is always, as in the case of many chemical tests, a personal factor to be guarded against. When an active extract is given to a susceptible animal, in the smallest dose that will produce any perceptible effect, one must watch closely for the slightest trace of incoordination, lack of attention, or drowsiness. It is particularly necessary for the animals to be confined in a room there nothing will excite the m, since when their attention is drawn to anything of interest the typical effect of the drug may disappear. The influence of the test dose of the unknown drug is carefully compared with that of the same dose of the standard"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 248 preparation administered to ano ther test dog at the same time and under the same conditions. Finally, when the animals become drowsy, the observations are recorded and the animals are returned to their quarters. The second day following, the observations upon the two dogs are reversed, i.e. , the animal receiving the test dose of the unknown receives a test dose of the known, and vice versa , and a second observation is made. If one desires to make a very accurate quantitative determination, it is advisable to use, not two dogs, but four or five, and to study the effects of the test dose of the unknown specimen in comparison with the test dose of the known, making several observations on alternate days. If the unknown is below standard activity, the amount should be increased until the ef fect produced is the same as for the test dose of the standard. If the unknown is above strength, the test dose is diminished accordingly. From the dose of the unknown selected as producing the same action as the test dose of the standard, the amount of dilution or concentration necessary is determined. The degree of accuracy with which the test is carried out will depend largely upon the experience of the observer and the care he exercises. Another point to be noted in the use of dogs for standardising Cannabis is that, although they never appear to lose their susceptibility, the same dogs cannot be used indefinitely for accurate testing. After a time they become so accustomed to the effects of the drug they refuse to stand on their feet, and so do not s how the typical inco - ordination which is its most characteristic and constant action. Previous to the adoption of the physiological test over twelve years ago, we were often annoyed by complaints of"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"A PHARMACEUTICAL STUDY 249 physicians that certain lots of drugs were inert; in fact some hospitals, before accepting their supplies of hemp preparations, asked for samples in order to make rough tests upon their patients before ordering. Since the adoption of the test we have not had a well - authenticated report of inactivity, although ma ny tons of the various preparations of Cannabis Indica have been tested and supplied for medicinal purposes. At the beginning of our observations careful search of the literature on the subject was made to determine the toxicity of the hemp. Not a single case of fatal poisoning have we been able to find reported, although often alarming symptoms may occur. A dog weighting 25 pounds received an injection of two ounces of an active U.S.P. fluid extract in the jugular vein with the expectation that it would certainly be sufficient to produce death. To our surprise the animal, after being unconscious for about a day and a half, recovered completely. This dog received, not alone the active constituents of the drug, but also the amount of alcohol contained in the fluid extract. Another dog received about 7 grammes of Solid Extract Cannabis with the same result. We have never been able to give an animal a sufficient quantity of a U.S.P. or other preparation of the Cannabis (Indica Americana) to produce death. There is some variation in the amount of extractive obtained, as would be expected from the varying amount of stems, seeds, etc., in the different samples. Likewise there is a certain amount of variation in the physiological action, but in every case the administration of 0 . 01 gramme of the extract per kilo body weight, has elicited the characteristic symptoms in properly selected animals."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 250 The repeated tests we have made convince us that Cannabis Americana properly grown and cured is fully as active as the best Indian drug. Furthermore, we have placed our quantities of fluid extract and solid extract of Cannabis Americana in the hands of experienced clinicians, and from eight of these men, who are all large users of the drug, we have received reports which state that they are unable to determine any therapeutic difference between the Cannabis Americana and the Cannabis Indica. CONCLUSIONS 1 . The method, outlined in the paper, for determining the physiological activity of Cannabis Sativa by internal administ ration to especially selected dogs, has been found reliable when the standard dose of extract 0 . 01 gramme per kilo body weight, is tested on animals, the effects being noted by an experienced observe in comparison with the effects of the same quantity of a standard preparation. 2 . Cannabis Sativa, when grown in various localities of the United States and Mexico, is found to be fully as active as the best imported Indian - grown Cannabis Sativa, as shown by laboratory and clinical tests. Much has been written relative to the comparative activity of Cannabis Sativa grown in different climates (Cannabis Indica, Mexicana and Americana). It has been generally assumed that the American - grown drug was practically worthless therapeutically, and that Cannabis Sativa grown in India must be used if one would obtain physiologically active preparations."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"A PHARMACEUTICAL STUDY 251 Furthermore, it has been claimed that the best Indian drug is that grown especially for medicinal purposes, the part used consisting of the flowering tops of the unfertili sed female plants, care being taken during the growing of the drug to weed out the male plants. According to our experience, this is an erroneous notion, as we have repeatedly found that the Indian drug which contains large quantities of seed is fully as active as the drug which consists of the flowering tops only, provided the seed be removed before percolation. Several years ago we began a systematic investigation of American - grown Cannabis Sativa. Samples from a number of localities were obtained and c arefully investigated. From these samples fluid and solid extracts were prepared according to the Pharmacopoeial method, and carefully tested upon animals for physiological activity, and eventually they were standardised by physiological methods. Repeated tests have convinced us that Cannabis Americana properly grown and cured is fully as active as the best Indian drug, while on the other hand we have frequently found Indian Cannabis to be practically inert. Before marketing preparations of Cannabis Americ ana, however, we placed specimens of the fluid and solid extracts in the hands of experienced clinicians for practical test; and from these men, all of whom had used large quantities of Cannabis Indica in practice, we have received reports which affirm tha t they have been unable to determine any therapeutic difference between Cannabis Americana and Cannabis Indica. We are, therefore, of the opinion that Cannabis Americana, will be found equally as efficient as, and perhaps more uniformly reliable than Canna bis Indica obtained from abroad,"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 252 since it is evident that with a source of supply at our very doors proper precautions can be taken to obtain crude drug of the best quality. The proper botanical name of the drug under considera - tion is Cannabis Sativa. Th e Indian plant was formerly supposed to be a distinct species per se , but botanists now consider the two plants to be identical. The old name of Cannabis Indica, however, has been retained in medicine. Cannabis Indica simply means Cannabis Sativa grown in the Indies, and Cannabis Americana means Cannabis Sativa grown in America. Its introduction into Western medicine dates from the beginning of the last century, but it has been used as an intoxicant in Asiatic countries from time immemorial, and under the name of “hashish,” “bhang,” “ganja,” or “charas,” is habitually consumed by upwards of two hundred millions of human beings. The physiological action of Cannabis Americana is precisely the same as that of Cannabis Inidca. The effects of this drug are sai d to be due chiefly to its action upon the central nervous system. It first produces a state of excitement similar to that of the initial stage of acute alcoholism. This excitement of the motor areas and other lower centres in the brain, according to W. E. Dixon, of the University of Cambridge, “is not the result of direct stimulation of these, but is due to depression of the highest and controlling centres. At all events there is a depression of the highest centres, and this is shown by diminished effic iency in the performance of mental work, by inability to concentrate attention, and by feeble judgment.” In lower animals the effects of Cannabis Indica resemble those in man, and present the same"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"A PHARMACEUTICAL STUDY 253 variations. A stage of exaltation with increased movement s is sometimes present, and is followed by depression, lassitude and sleep. Reflex excitability is first increased and then diminished. Cannabis Indica differs from opium in producing no disturbance of digestion and no constipation. The heart is general ly accelerated in man when the drug is smoked. Its intravenous injection into animals slows the pulse, partly through inhibitory stimulation and partly through direct action upon the heart muscle. The pupil is generally somewhat dilated. Death from acut e poisoning is extremely rare, and recovery has occurred after enormous doses. The continued abuse of hashish by natives of the East sometimes leads to mania and dementia, but does not cause the same disturbance of nutrition that opium does; and the habit ual use of small quantities, which is almost universal in some Eastern countries, does not appear to be detrimental to health. Cannabis Americana is employed for the same medicinal purposes as Cannabis Indica, which is frequently used as a hypnotic in case s of sleeplessness, in nervous exhaustion, and as a sedative in patients suffering from pain. Its greatest use has perhaps been in the treatment of various nervous and mental diseases, although it is found as an ingredient in many cough mixtures. In gene ral, Cannabis Americana can be used when a mild hypnotic or sedative is indicated, as it is said not to disturb digestion, and it produces no subsequent nausea and depression. It is of use in cases of migraine, particularly when opium in contra - indicated. It is recommended in paralysis agitans to quiet the tremors, in spasm of the bladder, and in sexual impotence not the result of organic disease, especially in combination with nux vomica and ergot."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 254 The ordinary dosage is: Extractum Cannabis Americanae, 0 . 01 gramme ( 1 . 5 grain). Fluidextractum Cannabis Americanae, 0 . 05 cc. ( 1 minim). The dosage of Cannabis Americana is the same as that of Cannabis Indica, as from our experiments we find that there is no therapeutic difference in the physiological action of the two drugs. Cannabis Sativa, when grown in the United States (Cannabis Americana) under careful precautions, is found to be fully as active as the best imported Indian - grown Cannabis Sativa, as shown by the laboratory and clinical tests. The advantages of using carefully prepared solid and fluid extracts of the home - grown drug are apparent when it is considered that every step of the process, from planting of the drug to the final marketing of the finished product, is under the supervision of experts.

The scene should have been laid in an inaccessible lamaserai in Tibet, perched on stupendous crags; and my familiarity wit h Central Asia would have enabled me to do it quite nicely. One should really have had an attendant Sylph; and one's Guru, a man of incredible age and ferocity, should have frequently appeared at the dramatic moment. A gigantic magician on a coal - black ste ed would have added to the effect: strange voices, uttering formidable things, should have issued from unfathomable caverns. A mountain shaped like a Svastika with a Pillar of Flame would have been rather taking; herds of impossible yaks, ghost - dogs, gry phons. ... But my good, friends, this is not the way things happen. Paris is as wonderful as Lhassa, and there are just as many miracles in London as in Luang Prabang.

Humanity is progressing; formerly men dwelt habitually in the exter ior world; nothing less than giants and Paynim and men - at - arms and distressed ladies, vampires and succubi, could amuse them. Their magicians brought demons from the smoke of blood, and made gold from baser metals. In this they succeeded; the intelligent perceived that the gold and the lead were but shadows of thought. It became probable that the elements were but isomers of one element; matter was seen to be but a modification of mind, or (at least) that the two things matter and mind must be joined befor e either could be perceived. All knowledge comes through the senses, on the one hand; on the other, it is only through the senses that knowledge comes. We then continue our conquest of matter; and we are getting pretty expert. It took much longer to perf ect the telescope than the motor - car. And though, of course, there are limitations, we know enough to be able to predict them. We know in what progression the Power to Speed coefficient of a steamboat rises — and so on. But in our conquest of Nature, which we are making principally by the use of the rational intelligence of the mind, we have become aware of that world itself, so much so that educated men spend nine - tenths of their waking lives in that world, only descending to feed and dress and so on at the imperative summons of their physical constitution.

But another set of people will find another disappointment. I am hardly an heroic figure. I am not The Good Young Man That Died. I do not remain in holy meditation, balanced on my left eyelash, for forty years, restoring e xhausted nature by a single grain of rice at intervals of several months. You will perceive in these pages a man with all his imperfections thick upon him trying blindly, yet with all his force, to control the thoughts of his mind, so that he shall be able to say “I will think this thought and not that thought” at any moment, as easily as (having conquered Nature) we are all able to say “I will drink this wine, and not that wine.” For, as we have now learnt, our happiness does not at all depend upon our pos sessions or our power. We would all rather be dead than be a millionaire who lives in daily dread of murder or blackmail. Our happiness depends upon our state of mind.

Previous records of mine have therefore seemed vague and obscure, even unto the wisest of the scribes; and I am my self afraid that even here all my skill of speech and study may avail me little, so that the most important part of the record will be blank. Now I cannot tell whether it is a part of my personal Kamma, or whether the Influence of the Equinox of Autumn sho uld be the exciting cause; but it has usually been at this part of the year that my best Results have occurred. It may be that the physical health induced by the summer in me, who dislike damp and chill, may being forth as it were a flower the particular kind of Energy — Sammaváyamo — which gives alike the desire to perform more definitely and exclusively the Great Work, and the capacity to achieve success. It is in any case remarkable that I was born in October ( 18 — ); suffered the terrible mystic trance which turned me toward the Path in October ( 18 — ); applied for admission to G ∴ D ∴ in October ( 18 — ); opened my temple at B —— e in"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 8 October ( 18 — ); received the mysteries of L.I.L. in October ( 19 — ); and obtained the grade of 6 ° = 5 °; obtained the first true mystic results in October ( 19 — ); first landed in Egypt in October ( 19 — ); landed again in Egypt in October ( 19 — ); first parted from . . . in October ( 19 — ); wrote the B. - i - M. in October ( 19 — ), and obtained the grade of 7 ° = 4 °; received the great Initiation in October 19 - ; and, continuing, received . . . . . . . . in October 19 — . So th en in the last days of September 19 — do I begin to collect and direct my thoughts; gently, subtly, persistently turning them one and all to the question of retreat and communion with that which I have agreed to call the Holy Guardian Angel, whose Knowledge and Conversation I have willed, and in greater or less measure enjoyed, since Ten Years. Terrible have been the ordeals of the Path; I have lost all that I possessed, and all that I love, even as at the Begin - ning I offered All for Nothing, unwitting as I was of the meaning of those words. I have suffered many and grievous things at the hands of the elements, and of the planets; hunger, thirst, fatigue, disease, anxiety, bereavement, all those woes and others have laid heavy hand upon me, and behold! as I look back upon these years, I declare that all hath been very well. For so great is the Reward which I (unworthy) have attained that the Ordeals seem but incidents hardly worthy to mention, save in so far as they are the Levers by which I moved the Wor ld. Even those dreadful periods of “dryness” and of despair seem but the necessary lying fallow of the Earth. All those “false paths” of Magic and Medi - tation and of Reason were not false paths, but steps upon the"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"JOHN ST. JOHN 9 true Path; even a a tree must shoot dow nwards its roots into the Earth in order that it may flower, and bring forth fruit in its season. So also now I know that even in my months of absorption in worldly pleasure and business, I am not really there, but stand behind, preparing the Event. Imagin e me, therefore, if you will, in Paris on the last day of September. How surprised was I — though, had I thought, I should have remembered that it was so — to find all my necessary magical apparatus to my hand! Months before, for quite other reasons, I had m oved most of my portable property to Paris; now I go to Paris, not thinking of a Retirement, for I now know enough to trust my destiny to bring all things to pass without anxious forethought on my part — and suddenly, therefore, here do I find myself — and not hing is lacking. I determined therefore to begin steadily and quietly, allowing the Magical Will to come slowly forth, daily stronger, in contrast to my old plan, desperation kindling a store of fuel dried by long neglect, despair inflaming a mad energy th at would blaze with violence for a few hours and then go out — and nothing done. “Not hurling, according to the oracle, a transcendent foot towards Piety.” Quite slowly and simply therefore did I wash myself and robe myself as laid down in the Goetia, taking the Violet Robe of an Exempt Adept (being a single Garment), wearing the Ring of an Exempt Adept, and that Secret Ring which hath been entrusted to my keeping by the Masters. Also I took the Almond Wand of Abramelin and the Secret Tibetan Bell, made of Electrum Magicum with its striker of human"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 10 bone.

I began then quite casually by performing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, finding to my great joy and some surp rise that the Pentagrams instantly formulated themselves, visible to the material eye as it were bars of shining blackness deeper than the night. I then consecrated myself to the Operation; cutting the Tonsure upon my head, a circle, as it were to admit th e light of infinity: and cutting the cross of blood upon my breast, thus symbolising the equilibration of and the slaying of the body, while loosing the blood, the first projection in matter of the universal Fluid. The whole formulating the Ankh — the Key of Life! I gave moreover the signs of the grades from 0 °= 0 ° to 7 °= 4 °. Then did I take upon myself the Great Obligation as follows: I. I, O.M. &c., a member of the Body of God, hereby bind myself on behalf of the whole Universe, even as we are now physically bound unto the cross of suffering: II. that I will lead a pure life, as a devoted servant of the Order: III. that I will understand all things: IV. that I will love all things V. that I will perform all things and endure all things VI. that I will con tinue in the Knowledge and Conversation of My Holy Guardian Angel: VII. that I will work without attachment:"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"JOHN ST.

And if I fail herein, may my pyramid be profaned, and the Eye be closed upon me! All this did I swear and seal with a stroke upon the Bell. Then I steadily sat down in my Asana (or sacred Posture), having my left heel beneath my body pres sing into the anus, my right sole closely covering the phallus, the right leg vertical; my head, neck, and spine in one straight vertical line; my arms stretched out resting on their respective knees; my thumbs joined each to the fourth finger of the prope r hand. All my muscles were tightly held; my breath came steady, slow and even through both nostrils; my eyes were turned back, in, up to the Third Eye; my tongue was rolled back in my mouth; and my thoughts, radiating from that Third Eye, I strove to shut in unto an ever narrowing sphere by concentrating my will upon the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.

Yet at the end, at the su preme accusation, the Hiereus smites him into death. The same answer avails him, and in its strength he is uplifted by his aspiration — and now he stands upright.

Evidently the Osiris Risen stage is over; and I think it is a case for violent measures. If one were to slack off now and hope for the morning, like a shipwrecked Paul, one would probably wake up a mere man of the world. The Question then arises: What shall I do to be saved? The only answer — and one which is quite unconnected with the question — is that a Ritual of Adeptus Major should display the Bi rth of Horus and Slaying of Typhon. Here again Horus and Harpocrates — the twins of the twin signs of 0 ° = 0 ° ritual — are the slayers of Typhon. So all the rituals get mixed: the symbols recur, though in a different aspect. Anyway, one wants something a de al better than the path of Pe in 4 ° = 7 ° ritual. I think the postulant should be actually scourged, tortured, branded by fire for his equilibrations at the various “Stations of the Cross” or points upon his mystic journey. He must assuredly drink blood fo r the sacrament — ah! now I see it all so well! The Initiator must kill him, Osiris; he must rise again as Horus and kill the Initiator, taking his place in the ceremony thence to the end. A bit awkward technically, but 'twill yield to science.

But scourging oneself is not easy with a robe on; and though one could take it off, there is this point to be considered: that one can never (except by a regrettable accident) hurt oneself more than one w ants to. In other words, it is impossible thus to inflict pain, and so flagellants have been rightly condemned as mere volup - tuaries. The only way to do so would be to inflict some torture whose severity one could not gauge at the time: e.g., one might dip oneself in petroleum and set light to it, as the young lady mystic did — I suppose in Brittany! — the other day. It's not the act that hurts, but the consequences; so, although one knows only roughly what will happen, one can force oneself to the act. T his, then, is a possible form of self - martyrdom. Similarly, mutilations; though it is perhaps just to observe that all these people are mad when they do these things, and their standard of pleasure and pain consequently so different from the sane man's as to be incomprehensible. Look at my Uncle Tom! who goes about the world bragging of his chastity. The maniac is probably happy — a peacock who is all tail! And squawk.

The only thing to do in short is to go steadily on, with a little extra courage and energy — no harm in that! — on the same old lines. The Winding of the Way must necessarily lead me just where it may happen to go. Why deliberately go off to Geburah? Why not aspire direct by the Path of the Moon - Ray unto the Ineffable Crown? Modesty is misplaced h ere! Very good. Then how aspire? Who is it that standeth in the Moon - Ray? The Holy Guardian Angel. Aye! O my Lord Adonai, Thou art the Beginning and the End of the Path.

JOHN 53 3 . 6 . I despair of asking my readers to distinguish between the common phenomenon of wandering thought and this phenomenon which is at the very portal of true and perfec t concentration; yet it is most important that the distinction should be seized. The further difficulty will occur — I hope! — of distinguishing between the vacancy of the idiot, and that destruction of thought which we call Shivadarshana, or Nirvikalpa - samad hi. [We must again refer the reader to the Hindu classics. — E D .] The only diagnostic I can think of is this; that there is (I can't be sure about it) no rational connection between the thought one left behind one and the new thought. In a simple wandering during the practice of concentration one can very nearly always (especially with a little experience) trace the chain. With neigh - bourhood - concentration this is not so. Perhaps there is a chain, but so great already is the power of prevent - ing the impr essions from rising into consciousness that one has no knowledge of the links, each one having been automatically slaughtered on the threshold of the consciousness. Of course, the honest and wary practitioner will have no difficulty in recognising the rig ht kind of wandering; with this explanation there is no excuse for him if he does.

I hope (by the way) that I have made it quite clear that all this time even a momentary cessation of active thought has been accompanied by the rising - up of the mantra. The rhythm, in short, perpetually dominat es the brain; and becomes active on every opportunity. The liquid Moslem mantra is much easier to get on to than is the usual Hindu type with its m and n sounds predominating: but it does not shake the brain up so forcibly. Perhaps 'tis none the worse for that. I think the unconscious training of the brain to an even rhythm better than startling it into the same by a series of shocks. I should like, to to remark that the suggestions in the “Herb Dangerous” [We hope to publish this essay in No. 2 of “The E quinox” — E D .] for a ritual seem the wrong way round. It seems to me that the Eastern methods are very arid, and chiefly valuable as a training of the Will, while the Ceremonies of the Magic of Light tune up the soul to that harmony when it is but one st ep to the Crown. The real plan is, then, to train the Will into as formid - able an engine as possible, and then, at the moment in the Ritual when the real work should be done, to fling forth flying that concentrated Will “whirling forth wit h re - echoin g Roa r, s o tha t i t ma y comprehen d with"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 56 9 . 0 . invincible Will ideas omniform, which flying forth from that one Fountain issued: whose Foundation is One, One and Alone.” As therefore Discipline of whatever kind is only one way of going into a wood at midnight o n Easter Eve and cutting the magic wand with a single blow of the magic knife, etc. etc. etc., we can regard the Western system as the essential one.

Is there such a thing? How do its phantoms differ from those of absinthe, reverie, and love, and so on? We may admit their unsubstantiality without denying their power; the phantoms of absinthe and love are potent enough to drive a man to death or marriage; while reverie may end in anti - vivisectionism or nut - food - madness. On the whole, I prefer to explain the many terrible catastrophes I have seen caused by magic misunder - stood by supposing that in magic one is working with some very subtle and essential func tion of the brain, whose disease may mean for one man paralysis, for another mania, for a third melancholia, for a fourth death. It is not à priori absurd to suggest that there may be some one particular thought that would cause death.

But might not a sudden f ear cause the heart to stop? I think cases are on record. But all this is unknown ground, or, as Frank Harris would say, Unpath'd Waters. We are getting dangerously near “mental arsenic” and “all — god — good — bones — truth — lights — liver — mind — blessing — heart — one and not of a series — ante and pass the buck.” The common sense of the practical man of the world is good enough for me! 1 . 10 . Will G. R. S. Mead or somebody wise like that tell me why it is that if I get out of my body and face (say) East, I can turn (in the “astral body”) as far as West - Sou' - West or thereabouts, but no further except with very great difficulty and after long practice? In making the circle, just as I got to West, I would swing right back to West - Nor' - West: turn easily enough, in sh ort, to any point but due West, within perhaps 5 °, but never pass that point. I have taught myself to do it, but always with an effort. Is this a common experience? I connect it with my faculty of knowing direction, which all mountaineers and travellers who have been with me admit to be quite exceptional.

And if I happen to have observed its compass bearing, of course I can deduce North by mere judgment of angle, at which I am very accurate. Fu rther, I keep a mental record, quite unconsciously, of the time occupied on a march; so that I can always tell the time within five minutes or so without consulting my watch. Further, I have another automatic recorder which maps out distance plus direction . Suppose I were to start from Scott's and walk (or drive; it's all the same to me) to Haggerston Town Hall (wherever Haggerston may be; but say it's N.E.), thence to Maida Vale. From Maida Vale I could take a true line for Piccadilly again and not go fi ve minutes walk out of my way, bar blind alleys, etc., and I should know when I got close to Scott's again before I recognised any of the surroundings. It always seems to me that I get an intuition of the direction and length of line A (Scott's to Haggerst on bee - line; in spite of any winding, it would make little odds if I went via Poplar), another intuition of line B (Haggerston to Maida Vale), and obtained my line C (back to Scott's) by “Subliminal trigonometry.” In this example I am assuming that I had n ever been in London before.

Well, I've woke myself writing this.

One thing at least is good; if anything does come of this great magical retirement — which I am beginning to doubt — it will not be mixed up with any other enthusiasm, poetic, venereal, or bacchanalian.

I ought to have performed a true Equilibration by an hour's Pr ana Yama in Asana (even if I had to do it without Kambhakham) at midnight, dawn, noon, and sunset, and I should have allowed nothing in heaven above, or in earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth, to have interfered with its due performance.

This food, eaten in a Yogin and ceremonial manner, is doing me good. I shall end, God willing, with coffee, cognac, and cigar.

It is true that some people find that if they hurt the body, they make the mind unstable . True; they predispose it to hallu - cination.

This may be the meaning of the command - m ent “Thou shalt not make any graven image,” etc., just as “Thou shalt not have any other Gods but me” implies single - minded devotion (Ekâgrata) to Adonai. So any mental or magical Image must necessarily fall short of the Truth. Consequently one has to wi ll that which is formless; and this is very difficult. To concentrate the mind upon a definite thing is hard enough; yet at least there is something to grasp, and some means of checking one's result.

But when th ey said to him, “See! he hath taken the road to Damascus!” that holy man answered, as he went quietly to the cemetery, “I will await him here!” So, therefore, there is one place, O thou thief of my heart's love, Adonai, to which thou must come at last; an d that place is the tomb in which lie buried all my thoughts and emotions, all that which is “I, and Me, and Mine.” There will I lay myself and await thee, even as our Father Christian Rosenkreutz that laid himself in the Pastos in the Vault of the Mounta in of the Caverns, Abiegnus, on whose portal did he cause to be written the words, “Post Lux Crucis Annos Patebo.” So Thou wilt enter in (as did Frater N.

I am wondering whether I have not made a mistake in allowing myself to sleep. It would be just like me, if there were only one possible mistake to make, to make it! I was perfect, had I only watched. But I let my faith run away with me. . . . I wonder. 6 . 45 . Dinner over, I go on as I am in calm faith and love. Why should I expect a catastrophic effect? Why should not the circumstances of Union with God be compatible with the normal consciousness? Inter - penetrating and illuminating it, if you like; but not destroying it. Well, I don't know why it shouldn't be; but I bet it isn't! All the spiritual experience I have had argues against such a theory. On the contrary, it will leave the reason quite intact, supreme Lord of its own plane. Mixing up the planes is the sad fate of man y a mystic. How many do I know in my own experience who tell me that, obedient to the Heavenly Vision, they will shoot no more rabbits! Thus they found a system on trifles, and their Lord and God is some trumpery little elemental masquerading as the Almi ghty. I remember my Uncle Tom telling me that he was sure God would be displeased to see me in a blue coat on Sunday.

H ow is it that I expect the reward at once? Surely I am presuming on my magical power, which is an active thing, and therefore my passivity is not perfect. Of course, when IT happens, it happens out of time and space — now or ten years hence it is all the s ame. All the same to IT; not all the same to me, O.M. So O.M. (the dog!) persists irrationally in wanting IT, here and now. Surely, indeed, it is a lack of faith, a pandering to the time - illusion . . . and so forth. Yes, no doubt it is all magically w rong, even magically absurd; yet, though I see the snare, I deliberately walk into it. I suppose I shall be punished somehow . . . Good! there's the excuse I wanted. Fear is failure: I must dare to do wrong. Good! 7 . 50 . It has just occurred to me tha t this Waiting and Watching is the supreme Magical strain. Every slight sound or other impression shocks one tremendously. It is easy enough to shut out sounds and such when one is concentrating in active magic: I did all my early evocations in Chancery Lane. But now one is deliberately opening all the avenues of sense to admit Adonai! One has destroyed one's own Magic Circle. The whole of that great Building is thrown down. . . . Therefore I am in a worse hole that I ever was before — and I've only just realized it. A footfall on the pavement is most acute agony — because it is not Adonai. My hearing, normally rather dull, is intensely sharpened; and I am thirty yards from the electric trams of the Boulevard Montparnasse at the busiest hour of the evening. . . ."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 84 7 . 50 . And the Visconti may turn up! . . . Eli, Eli, lama sabacthani! 8 . 45 . I went out to the Dôme to drink my final citron pressé and to avoid the Visconti. Am returned, and in bed. I shall try and sleep now, waking in time for midnight and t he quiet hours. 8 . 53 . I have endured the supreme temptation and assault of the Enemy. In this wise. First, I found that I did not want sleep — I couldn't stop “Waiting.” Next, I said “Since last night that Black Ritual (see entry 10 . 55 ) did at least serve to turn all my thoughts to the One Thought, I will try it again . . .” Then I said: “No; to do so is not pure ‘waiting.;’ ” And then — as by a flash of lightning — the Abyss of the Pit opened, and my whole position was turned. I saw my life from the dawn of consciousness till now as a gigantic “pose”; my very love of truth assumed for the benefit of my biographer! All these strange things suffered and enjoyed for no better purpose than to seem a great man. One cannot express the horror of this thought; i t is The thought that murders the soul — and there is no answer to it. So universal is it that it is impossible to prove the contrary. So one must play the man, and master it and kill it utterly, burying it in that putrid hell from which it sprang. Luck ily I have dealt with it before.

Have you been fooled all along?” But to - night's thought struck at my own integrity, at the inmost truth of the soul and of Adonai. As I said, there is no answer to it; and as these seven days have left me fairly master of the fortress, I caught him young, and assigned him promptly to the oubliette. I put down this — not as a “pose” — but because the business is so gigantic. It encourages me immensely; for if my Dweller on the Threshold be that mo st formidable devil, how vast must be the Pylon that shelters him, and how glorious must be the Temple just beyond! 9 . 30 . It seems that there was one more mistake to make; for I've made it! I started to attempt to awaken the Kundalini — the magical serpen t that sleeps at the base of the spine; coiled in three coils and a half around the Sushumna; and instead of pumping the Prana up and down the Sushumna until Siva was united with Sakti in the Sahasrara - Cakkram, I tried — God knows why; I'm stupider than an a ss or H . . . C . . . . — to work the whole operation in Muladhara — with the obvious result. There are only two more idiocies to perform — one, to take a big dose of Hashish and record the ravings as if they were Samadhi; and two, to go to church. I may as wel l give up."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 86 9 . 30 . Yet here answers me the everlasting Yea and Amen: Thou canst not give up, for I will bring thee through. Yet here I lie, stripped of all magic force, doubting my own peace and faith, farther from Adonai than ever before — and yet — and yet — Do I not know that every error is a necessary step in the Path? The longest way round is the shortest way home. But it is disgusting! There's a grim humour in it, too. The real Devil of the Operation must be sitting with sardonic grin upon his face, e njoying my perplexity — For that Dweller - of - the - Threshold - thought was not as dead as I supposed; as I write he comes again and again, urging me to quit the Path, to abandon the unequal contest. Luckily, friend Dweller, you prove too much! Your anxiety show s me that I am not as far from attainment as my own feelings would have me think. At least, though, I am thrown into the active again; I shall rise and chant the Enochian Calls and invoke the Bornless One, and clear a few of the devils away, and get an ar my of mighty angels around me — in short, make another kind of fool of myself, I wonder? Anyway, I'll do it. Not a bad idea to ask Thoth to send me Taphtatharath with a little information as to the route — I do not know where I am at all. This is a strange c ountry, and I am very lonely.

The L.V.X. came, too but not enough to pierce the awful shroud of darkness that by my folly I have woven for myself. So at the end I found myself on the floor, so like Rodin's Cruche Cassée Danaide Girl as never was . . . As I ought to have been in the beginning! Well, one thing I got (again!), that is, that when all is said and done, I am that I am, a nd all these thoughts of mine, angels and devils both, are only fleeting moods of me. The one true self of me is Adonai. Simple! Yet I cannot remain in that simplicity. I got this “revelation” through the Egyptian plane, a partial illumination of the re ason.

I am quite happy as a result of my little ceremony — whereas I ought to be taking new and terrible oaths! Yet why should Tahuti be so kind to me, and A sar Un - nefer so unkind? The answer comes direct from Tahuti himself: Because you have learned to write perfectly, but have not yet taught yourself to suffer. True enough, the last part!

For some reason or other, Pranaya ma is quite easy. Concentrating on Adonai, I was in Kambhakham for a whole minute without distress. It is true, by the way. I was — and am — in some danger of looking on this Record as a Book; i.e. , of emphasising things for their literary effect, and dimini shing the importance of others which lend themselves less obviously.

I can see an endless avenue in every case. In short, like the hashish - drunkard in full bl ast, I am overwhelmed by the multitude of my own magical Images. I have become the great Magician — Mayan, the Maker of Illusion — the Lord of the Brethren of the Left - hand Path. I don't “wear my iniquity as an aureole, deathless in Spiritual Evil,” as Mr. Wa ite thinks; but it's nearly as bad as that. There seems only one reply to this great question of the Hunchback (I like to symbolize the spirit of Questioning by “?” — a little crooked thing that asks questions) and that is to keep on affirming Adonai, and refusing to be obsessed by any images of discipline or magic. Of course! but this is just the difficulty — as it was in the Beginning, is now, and every shall be, world without end!

I ought to observe that this is a very striking result of forging this magic chain; for in my normal life I a m one of the soundest sleepers imaginable.

Also I was too pleased with the Heralds of my Lord's coming — the vision of Khephra, etc. It was perhaps this subtle self - satisfaction that lost me . . . so I fell to the shocking abyss of last night! The Dweller of the Threshold is never visible until after one has fallen; he is a Veiled God and smites like the Evil Knight in Malory, riding and slaying — and no man seeth him. But when you are tumbled headlong into Hell, where he lives, then he unveils his Face, and blasts you with its horror! Very g ood, John St. John, now you know!

Go at it more reverently and humbly — oh, you dog, how I loat he you for your Vileness! To have risen so high, and — now — to be thus fallen! 4 . 40 .

Instead o f the Great Balance firmly held, I found only Libra, the house of Venus and of the exaltation of Saturn; and these evil planets, smiling and frowning, overcame me. And so for the sublime Path of Man; instead of that symbol of the Adept, his foot set firml y upon heaven, his whole figure showing forth the Reconciler with the Invisible, I found but the stagnant and bitter water of selfishness, the Dead Sea of the Soul.

During his Kambhakham he willed Adonai with all his might. Let him sleep, invoking Adonai! 5 . 40 . Well hath he slept, and well awakened. The last entry should extend to 3 . 30 or thereabouts; probably later; for, invoking Adonai, he again got the beginnings of the Light, and the “telephone - cross” voices very strongly.

But the Perfume and the Vision came not, nor any full manifest ation of the L.V.X., the Secret Light, the light that shineth in darkness. John St. John is again very sleepy.

But his nature itself, forced through these days into the one channel of Will towards Adonai, went on struggling on its own account. Later, the conscious man took heart and strove, though not so fiercely as before. He passed through the Lightnings of Ajna, whose two petals now spread out like wings above his head, and the awful Corona of the Interior Sun with its flashing fires appeared, and declared itself to be his Self .

The ideal condition seems likely to be perfect oblivion — or (in the Adept) is the Tamo - Guna, the Power of elemental Darkness, broken once and for ever, so that His sleep is vivid and rational as another man's waking; His waking another man's Samadhi; His Samadhi — to which He ever strives —— ? ? ? ? ?

See also the Rosicrucian lecture on the Microcosmos, where this view is certainly upheld , the Qliphoth of an Adept being balanced and trained to fill his Malkuth, vacated by the purified Nephesch which has gone up to live in Tiphereth. Or so O.M. read it. The other idea of the Light descending and filling each principle with its glory is, it seems to him, less fertile, and less in accord with any idea of Evolution. (What would Judas McCabbage think?) And one can so readily understand how tremendous a task is that of the postulant, since he has to glorify and initiate all his principles and tra in them to their new and superior tasks. This surely explains better the terrible dangers of the path. . . . Some years back, on the Red River in China, John St. John saw at every corner of that swift and dangerous stream a heap of wreckage. . . . He, hims elf in danger, thought of his magical career. Alcoholism, insanity, disease, faddism, death, knavery, prison — every earthly hell, reflection of some spiritual blunder, had seized his companions. By dozens had that band been swept away, dashed to pieces on one rock or another.

For, dazzled as he is by the blinding brilliance of this morning's Spiritual Sun, which yet he beheld but darkly, to him now ev en the light of earth seems dark.

Well, he has got to get up more steam somehow, though the boiler bursts. Perhaps early dinner, with Ritual, may induce that Enthusiastic Energy of which the Gnostics write. This morning the whole Sankhara - dhatu (the tendency of the being John St. John) was operating aright. N ow by no effort of will can he flog his tired cattle along the trail. So poor a thing is he that he will even seek an Oracle from the book of Zoroaster. Done. Zoroaster respectfully wishes to point out that “The most mystic of discourses informs us — his wh oleness is in the Supra - Mundane Order; for there a Solar World and Boundless light subsist, as the Oracles of the Chaldeans affirm.” Not very helpful, is it? As if divination could ever help on such exalted planes! As if the trumpery elementals that operat e these things possessed the Secrets of the Destiny of an Adept, or could help him in his agony!

(P.S. — Doubt has arisen about this perfume, as to whether there was not a co mmonplace cause. On the balance of the evidence, carefully considered, one would pronounce for the mystic theory.) One should add a curious omen. On sitting down for the great struggle ( 11 . 14 ) John St. John found a nail upon the floor, at his feet.

There is no money in his purse, no steam in his boilers — that's what's the matter with John St. John. It is clear enough, what happened yesterday. He failed at the four Pylons in turn; in the morning Fear st opped him at that of Horus and so on; while in the evening he either failed at the Pylon of Thoth, i.e ., was obsessed by the necessity (alleged) of recording his results, or failed to overcome the duality of Thoth.

Darwin studies Nature with more reverence and enthusiasm, but without antics — and out comes the Law of Evolution.

The Next Step for humanity in general was then “the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.” One thing at a time. But here he finds himself discussing and disputing with himself the nature of that Knowledge.

This is simply damnable. Egoism is the spur of all energy, in a way; and in this particular case it is the one thing that is not Adonai (whatever else may be) and so the antithesis of the Work. Bricks without straw, indeed! That's nothi ng to it. This job is like being asked to judge a Band contest and being told that one may do anything but listen. Only worse! One could form some idea of how they were playing through other senses; in this case every faculty is the enemy of the Work. At first sight the problem seems insoluble. It may be so, for me. At least, I have not solved it. Yet I have come very near it, many a time, of old; have solved it indeed, though in a less important sense than now I seek. I am not to be content with litt le or with much; but only with the Ultimate Attainment. Apparently the method is just this; to store up — no matter how — great treasures of energy and purity, until they begin to do the work themselves (in the way that the Hindus call Sukshma). Just so the e ngineer — five feet six in his boots — and his men build the dam. The snows melt on the mountains, the river rises, and the land is irrigated, in a way that is quite independent of the physical strength of that Five foot Six of engineer.

The objection is as silly as the objection to illustrating Geometry by Diagrams, on the ground that printed lines are thick — and so on. This is the imbecility of the “Protestant” objection to images. What fools these m ortals be!

How much wiser for the man to behave as a man, the God as a God! This is my real bed - rock objection to the Eastern systems. They decry all ma nly virtue as dangerous and wicked; and they look upon Nature as evil. True enough, everything is evil relatively to Adonai; for all stain is impurity. A bee's swarm is evil — inside one's clothes. “Dirt is matter in the wrong place.” It is dirt to con nect sex with statuary, morals with art. Only Adonai, who is in a sense the True Meaning of everything, cannot defile any idea.

It has always been my custom on this night to look back over the year, and to ask: What have I done? T he answer is invariably “Nothing.” Yet of what men count deeds I have done no small share. I have travelled a bit, written a bit . . . I seem to have been hard at it all the time — and to have got nothing finished or successful. One Traged y — on e littl e comed y — tw o essays — a dozen poems or so — two or three short stories — odds and ends of one sort and another: it's a miserable record, though the Tragedy is good enough to last a life.

And the Chamber was filled with that wondrous glow of ultra - violet light self - luminous, without a source, that hath no counterpart in Nature unless it be in that Dawn of the North. . . . And there were reveled unto me certain Words of Power . . . And I invoked my Lord and recited the Book Ararita at the Altar . . . This holy inspired book (delivered unto me in the winter of last year) was now at last understanded of me; for it is, though I knew it not, a complete scheme of this Operation.

But He withdrew Himself, for that I must do that which I was sent hither to do; namely, to rule the earth. Therefore with sweetness ineffable He parted from me; yet leaving a comfort not to be told, a Peace . . . the Peace.

I suppose it must read as a patchwork of most inhar - monious colour, a thing without continuity or cohesio n.

Of course my rational memory picking out details finds otherwise. But I seem to have two memories almost as if bel onging to two strata of being.
