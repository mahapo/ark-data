But before you do this you ’ ll need to adjust the “ Z o- diac Degree Offset/Ayanamsa ” . This is the fun part. Pick a date for calc u lation using 12:00 noon your local timezone accounting for daylight sa v ings. Each planet is either superior or inferior to the Sun as viewed from Earth. Any planet at or past the far side of the Sun is superior while any planet at or past the near side of the Sun is inferio r. These determine the ensigns each planet makes to the Earth. E.g. Mars superior makes the planetary sign “ Scorpio ” , or purified aspect of Mars. Venus inferior makes “ Ta u rus ” , or guilty aspect of Venus. Jupiter superior is “ Sagittarius ” & inferior is “ Pis ces ” . Saturn sup e- rior is “ Capricorn ” as inferior is “ Aquarius ” . Mercury i n ferior is “ Gemini ” whereas superior is “ Virgo ” . Venus superior is “ Libra ” while Mars inferior is “ Aries ” . Remember, these are synodic aspects or phases of planets to the Earth. As in the su m mary given above, “ Taurus ” is the energy exerted by the planet Venus to the Earth, not an a r bitrary “ sign ” up in the sky or in the angle of sun - light in Earth ’ s tropical seasons. The planetary e n- signs are the radial m o tions and velocities of plane ts towards or away from the Earth, either acce l erating/decelerating. So we see, the planetary ensigns have both direction and magnitude relative to the center of the Earth, as called vectors. These planetary vectors are dynamic, not static. A planet ’ s maxi mum velocity toward or away from Earth is achieved near maximum elongation east or west of the Sun. Keeping this in mind, open the “ Calculation Settings... ” <Alt+Shift+S>, and note the user - definable field for the ayanamsa value. You can enter any decimal value from 360 to - 360 ecliptic arcdegrees. For now, leave it at 0, and click “ Cancel ” <Esc>. Toggle your house system to “ Null ” , and be sure “ Show Graphics ” <v> is enabled. I recommend temporarily di s abling Uranus, Neptune & Pluto to rectify the horoscope by adjusting the ayanamsa accor d ingly. You can see the position of each planet to the Sun and if it is s u perior or inferior. For the Moon waxing is superior and waning is inferior; lunar eclipses are near inferior conjun c tion while solar eclipses are near superior. See? Planets near maximum elongation are at maximum ma g- nitude in proportion to their maximum velocity. E.g. if Jupiter is square to the Sun in close orb, then Jupiter is close to maximum strength either superior or inferior, meaning it is very s trong in Sagittarius or Pisces, respectively. But, Mercury ’ s maximum elongation never e x ceeds about 28 d e grees, which is barely approaching semisextile the Sun. So Mercury ’ s phases of Virgo and Gemini are near maximum radial velocity much closer than squar e or 90 degrees to the Sun but are always well - under 30 degrees/semisextile. The maximum elong a tion for Venus never exceeds more than about 47 degrees which is barely in excess of semisquare. For obv i- ous reasons, only the planets far - beyond Earth ’ s orbit c an achieve square plus greater a s pects to the Sun. I remind you that each planet ’ s orbital eccentricity and inclination etc. affect su b tle"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 3 asynchronicity to aspects; but overall, the long - term averages justify using aspect without r e- gard to the relatively slight, inconsequential incommensurabilities as such complex orbital elements do introduce into our otherwise si m plistic aspect equations. This is readily apparent with Mercury for example, whose orbit is second most eccentric in the whole solar system, a bout 0.2056 (cf. Pluto at 0.2528), so it ’ s not uncommon to pr e dict synodic multiples for Mercury and be in e r ror by as much as five or six days, but over the longer term these errata average out, and your long - term predictions for Mercury are r e- markably ac curate ergo reliable. Venus and Earth, by contrast, have relatively low ecce n tricity or near - circular sidereal orbits, about 0.0068, & 0.0167, respectively. That means Venus is very predictable, even over the short term. Remember that the long - term synodic , trop i cal & sidereal multiples are proven by millennia of observation, which calibrated even the ancient ephe m eris beyond extrapolated theory, e.g. Babylonians, Mayans etc. Now, we can be content to use simple 15 - degree multiples for evaluating planetary a s pects acquiring or separating. By always using the Sun as homeplate in our calculations, we become conscious of the solar day and pos i tion of the Sun relative to our perpetually - rotating Earth, orbiting the Sun year after year, and century after century . This is fundamental to e x panding our awareness of the planets who orbit the Sun sidereally and orbit Earth synod i cally. There are two distinct, but directly related attunements of awareness: one strictly geoce n- tric, without regard to the daily rotation o f Earth ’ s slightly - oblate sphere and two, being the twelve equally - divided meridians of Earth along her terrestrial equator...and where they inte r- sect her caelestial equator — which is the ecliptic, the short - term mean Earth - Sun plane. This is best illustr ated by the AutoCAD graphic depiction below, showing this in three dime n sions: We’ll cover more on the houses in later chapters. But the first reference which is the strictly geocentric is focused on a point in space for every planet, each point at t heir centers, as calc u- lated by reflected light reaching the Earth ’ s geoce n ter. These calculated points in space are therefore coincident with Earth ’ s own geocenter but unlike Earth ’ s geocenter, they are r e ferred to the calculated center of each r e spective planet at considerable distances from the Earth."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 4 This is dependent in turn on the theoretical value of ‘ c ’ within the near - vacuum of local solar system space. Thus we say “ rays of light ” as a crown of seven stars diatonically & twelve stars chromatically. To state this another way we are looking out from the computed center of Earth in all directions, viewing r e flected light bouncing off planets, compensating for the time it takes for light to reach us; to reach our eyes in fact although during daylight hou rs we can ’ t differentiate between such relatively dim light and the majestic brilliance of our Sun at magn i- tude 26.8, while in theory reaching us at our Earth ’ s own geoce n ter. Can you imagine being nearly four thousand miles down to the center of Earth? Y ou can imagine being at the center already, i.e. you are already at the ce n ter. Understand? Place the crown of seven rays and twelve stars upon your own head; you ’ re at the conceptual center of calculation. While you can ’ t imagine being at the center of th e Earth, you can imagine your own mind being at the center of you, and therefore the concept of Earth is at the same ce n ter. In essence you equate your mind in attunement with Earth. WAR!

Recall the “ two a t tunements ” of awareness, one is strictly geocent ric, and two, the meridian houses of the horoscope, which considers Earth as a sphere, not just a point in space. The ensigns, or radial motions of the planets, pertain to the first or strictly geocentric awareness. The aspect list pertains to both, the a s pects being strictly geocentric, and their signs/houses of the horoscope, our mundane sphere numbered by plan e- tary Gods. There is a third attunement, that of the location & time - specific chart in which the precise positions of planets and meridian house - c usps determines horoscopic rulership sc e- na r ios, with added significance of decans and pentads, and the local Ascendant, Ar a bic parts, and the quadrants. So, to promote and achieve the first awareness, consider the planets strictly as points in space, geoce ntric only. No houses, no horoscope, only relative positions of each planet to Earth plus their relative positions to the Sun as viewed from Earth. These are the planetary aspects in 3D space as relative to Earth ’ s geocenter of calculation. T he synodic pos ition of the planets to the Sun determine whether a planet is moving t o- ward the Earth or away from Earth. That is the radial motion of the planets to Earth, and is the most fundamentally affective influence on the psyche. Edgar Cayce made it very clear tha t souls coming to Earth and souls leaving the Earth are at constant war, literally fighting the ba t- tle of Arm a geddon which is the war of ten sidereal years — in reference to the orbits of each planet in sidereal orbital order numbering from the Moon to Plu to, i.e. from I to X, hence the war of Titans vs. Olympians and their victory by the reign of the Gods in the houses of the horoscope: the theme of freewill in the te m ple of the body. This understanding was universal in ancient times, but was abandoned by religious schisms over the centuries before and since. Consider, the three wise men who visited 10 ½ month - old Jesus in Bethlehem were M a goi,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 7 kings and astrologers who had journeyed over six hundred miles from the east, from Babylon & Parthian kingdoms. Th e Magoi were religious a s trologers, judicial astrologers of excellent astronomical & psychic aptitude. They had correctly predicted, deduced and acted upon the observations of the Venus - Jupiter conjunctions of Aug 12, 3 BC and June 17, 2 BC. The go s- pel “ A c cording to Matthew ” makes this perfectly clear — only heathens don ’ t get this. The judicial astrologer knows that astrology is religion, just as any well - disciplined sc i ence is done religiously. Fundamentalist religious fanatics who denounce astrology simply lack comprehension of the subject matter. This is no different for secular academia, atheists, ske p- tics or whatever epithet they bluster, all are not one iota less orthodox than the Pope! Of course they can ’ t acknowledge such obvious similarities in their behaviour, but we can all agree that both atheist and fundamentalist alike are vehemently against astrology — for lack of study no doubt. The geocentric - only awareness of the position of planets to the Earth is far easier to rea l ize today, than it was in th e days of the Magi who did obe i sance to the Messiah. Back in those days the “ 70 Weeks ” prophecy of Daniel was common knowledge, and so the Messiah was expected by all. Even Caesar Augustus wondered if he himself might be the prophesied Me s- siah, as did many others. All expected the Messiah to come about that time, including the M a- goi, so the “ Emperor & Empress ” conjunction of Jupiter and Venus was not so obscure to deduce as “ his star at its rising ” . But we can be sure the Magoi had advanced psychic senses, o w ing in no small part to their real nocturnal vigilance. What took them arduous hours of calculation takes us one or two clicks of a mouse. Technology has come a long way. That ’ s the focus of this lesson, to promote awareness of the planets by their posit ions to the Earth, from simple geocentric aspect and radial motion, to daily horoscopes, then lastly to n a- tal and event charts with the real - time transits and progressions of the solar system as a whole, all relating to souls both individually and collecti vely, both incarnate on Earth and di s carnate among the heavens. With today ’ s technology there ’ s no excuse not to do this, esp e cially since it helps to sharpen our psychic abi l ity. Key to maintaining a constant awareness of the positions of the planets to Earth, is to gain familiarity with the predictable synodic periods of each planet, particularly the seven planets of the week, which are Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn by order of di a- tonic fifths. Nat u rally the Sun & Moon orbit relati ve to Earth by apparent sidereal motion, while all other planets are synodic orbits and appear to orbit the Sun epicyclically. The appa r- ent phases of the Moon are of course synodic as are all the other planets ’ phases. That ’ s the difference between apparen t lunar sid e real motion and synodic phase. The Astrolog program makes it easy to follow the motions of the planets on a daily basis. That ’ s fine, but it ’ s a lot be t ter just to memorize each planet ’ s synodic period, then mark dates on your calendar for when each planet is at inferior conjunction for Mars, Jupiter & Saturn"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 8 since you can spot them weather permitting in the night sky as they are at solar oppos i tion, and watch for the heliacal risings at your location. Mark next year ’ s calendar when each planet will reappear at its synodic i n tervals. Also mark the dates for Mercury & Venus at maximum elong a tion. Remember that any like - phase of a planet repeats synodic motion at fairly predictable i n- tervals. Mostly for Venus, but least for Mercury, b e cause of orbi tal eccentricities as previously discussed. E.g., about every 584 days, you can bet that Venus will be very near where you predicted it would be, from like - phase to like - phase. But that ’ s a long time to wait. We can count the days that Venus gets lost in t he saturation of sunlight, about ninety days as centered around superior conjunction, meaning we can see Venus for the first time about forty - five days after her superior conjunction ge t ting brighter and more prominent in the evening sky. As the bright mor ning star, Venus is lost for only around eight days centered on inferior con - junction four days after which Venus emerges at heliacal rising, then becoming more prom i- nent as the morning star. For instance, the next superior conjunction for Venus is August 18, 2003. Add 45 days and you get October 2, 2003. I ’ ll mark Friday, October 3 to remind me to go out after sunset and see if I can ’ t locate Venus just barely above the horizon, probably a degree or two below Spica, since the Sun is about mid - Virgo on tha t date each year in our present epoch. Knowing familiar bright fiducial stars by their positions on the caelestial zodiac makes it easier to spot planets relative to the Sun, since we know where the Sun is on every date of the year as if se c- ond - nature. Kno wing where the Sun is shows the phases planets are in.

You ’ ll know about when a planet will go retrograde since you know its synodic phase, and so you ’ ll know about how long it will stay retrograde if you memorize five values, Mercury 22, Venus 42, Mars 73, Jupiter 121, & Saturn 138 days average retrograde centered on inferior conjunction. Their synodic period s are just as easily remembered with I - 29.53, II - 116, III - 584, IV - n/a, V - 780, VI - 400, VII 378. Phases of the Moon are already printed on most calendars, so you always know that you can look for the crescent of the new Moon one or two days after superior co njunctions, or on rare occasions you ’ ll see a partial or total solar eclipse, thereby visibly co n firming Moon - Sun conjunction."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 9 It ’ s really not hard to do — once you get used to it. You can learn the motions of the pla n- ets in simple terms, by their average synodic period, and by marking a few dates on your ca l- endar to remind you of when to look for their lights in the night sky. And you ’ ll know by their m o tion relative to the Sun what time and where to look for them. The key here is the Sun. Ever y one knows w hat a solar day is. At midnight LAT you know the Sun is antemidheaven or IC on your local meridian of longitude. To wit when Mars reaches opposition this August 28th, you ’ d better go out and enjoy the view, weather permitting.

Look for Deneb and Fomalhaut above and below bright Mars and you ’ ll be able to see and reme m- ber what ten degrees caelestial Aquarius looks like in the night sky. Since Mars will be som e- what below the ecliptic at the time (between 6 and 7 degrees), then you ’ ll see about where the ecli p tic is in that part of the sky.

Co n sciously know where the planets are, then get out once and awhile and make sure they are out there! The judicial astrologer must also be the astronomer. See? In summary, our first awar e ness is geocentric: center of the sphere of activity. Every planet in our solar system functions as part of the whole. Our soul is alive in the ten heavens, which is consciousness and partic i pation in each sphere thereof; for each of us individually, and as an aggregation continually evolving by the very elements of crea tion. Learning who the Gods are is to acknowledge their presence, from their positions in our solar system to Earth with respect to the Sun, archetypally universal, and powerfully affective in their astrological infl u- ence from their positions to the Earth in real - time eternally."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" C HAPTER 2 T HE DAILY rotation of Earth forms the cornerstone of the ephemeris, which means lite r ally, “ day - book of the Gods ” . Since time immemorial, the chain of transactions in mans life exper i- ences has been inextricably linked to the Sun, the central power source in our solar sy s tem, preserving all life nearby, providing light and warmth to the world. We acknowledge the power of SgrA* at the galactic center as the “ Sun of our Sun ” and whole Milky Way, but this is about the special relationship between our Sun and Earth, our Sun and the awesome planets of a living solar system. While we know that crustal displacements of catastrophic proportions have occurred three times since c. 55,000 BC, the tilt of Earth ’ s rotation to the eclipti c has f a- vored its approximately 23 - degree inclination (presently 23.44 degrees) since the fall of man ~200,000 BC, according to Cayce. This rotational angle is the pr i mary cause of her seasonal imbalances and extreme weather from the tropics to the poles. Happily, the bible says this will be fixed by 2331 AD, with this sanctuary again upright to the Sun; i.e. Earth follows the u p- rightness of the body of Christ. The Earth ’ s rotational obliquity is gradually d e creasing, but Cayce makes it clear that surprisin g changes will be first “ noticeable ” within the span of one calendar month, and that man will experience the first part of it to wit: “ In October there will be seen the first variation in the position of the polar star in relation to the lines from the Gr eat Pyramid. The dipper is gradually changing, and when this change becomes noticeable - as might be calculated from the Pyramid - there will be the beginning of the change in the races. ” — Ref. 5748 - 6, June 1932 Of course the proper motion of stars shows the dipper is very slowly changing, just as all stars move in relation to the local standard of rest \\ sgrab. But this is surely alluding to the a p- pearance of our northern sky to rotate approximately around the star we presently call “ P o- laris ” , named for i ts pro x imity along the north axis of rotation. In contrast, Earth ’ s ecliptic axis lines up near NGC6543 (Cat ’ s Eye Nebula @ +89:50 ’ 33 ” J2000), with Eta 1 D o rado ( - 89:11 ’ 29 ” ) near ecliptic - polar opposition. This is the Earth ’ s caele s tial axis, about which h er rotational axis has precessed at a rate of ~25,626.83 years per gyration. As Earth ’ s axis of rot a- tion shifts more pe r pendicular to the ecliptic, then precession will abate, and the Moon ’ s orbit will become more uniform, and Earth shall flourish with one , perpetual se a son — as we will be “ hyperboreans ” , as the myth says of man living eternally, without sorrow. When man n o tices this “ first variation ” in October, then you can rest assured that it won ’ t take long for Earth ’ s obliquity to continue shifting dram atically in the weeks or months following this long - awaited change; surprising only to those who weren ’ t expecting it, but that doesn ’ t mean all of us"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 11 won ’ t be deeply affected, and undoubtedly worried that the Earth may spin off into the blue yonder? But l o, the power of the Sun to hold planets in orbit is assured to prevent such plan e- tary annihilation for aeons. To understand how our present obliquity affects meridian houses of the Earth, just open the Astrolog program, and, assuming you set your defaults as listed in the previous chapter, set animation “ Jump Rate ” <Shift+#> to hours to watch the meridian cusps (i.e., where they intersect the ecliptic) o s cillate twice a day. This oscillation occurs along the intersection of Earth ’ s meridians of longitude wi th the ecliptic, commencing on the local meridian. For the meridian cusps to remain at or near 30 degrees, then Earth ’ s equ a tor must be near co - planar with the ecliptic. Our terrestrial sphere of experience is referenced first to Earth ’ s geocenter, then to the ge o- graphical meridians. Conceptually, the geocentric “ observer ” sees lights from all dire c tions in contrast to the background tenebrosity of Earth ’ s caelestial sphere. By calculation, a planet ’ s meridian houses originate at its geocenter, “ looking ” at the direction of the local meridian e s- tablished by event location. For natal charts this is of course location of birth. Same for death charts. Activity between birth and death follows the living, breathing entity ’ s location in real - time and always in ref erence to the natal horoscope. The geocenter is a conceptual, astronomically - calculated point in 3D space but the point i t- self occupies no space. This distinction is what makes the ge o center necessarily a concept only as with any single point in space: it has no corporeal existence. A conceptual line b e tween points is an infinite set of no n existent points that satisfy an equation. The reality of light by which all ca l culations are formulated and calibrated prove the positions of the planets such that our pl anetary ephemeris is reliable to the point of sheer mi l liarcsecond - accuracy thanks to JPL. For professional astronomers with powerful telescopes or any instrument that requires the hair - splitting accuracy of the JPL ephemeris and mo d ern star catalogues, su ch is par for the course. But for common observers with a tiny telescope, binoculars or stargazing with the u n- aided eye, the common man need only count by days, and measure with extended fingers & hands to estimate planetary positions against the night sky with a little knowledge & pra c tice. As you ’ ve already learned, every planet ’ s synodic period reveals its sidereal orbit and pro x- imity to the Sun over mere decades of observation. That ’ s why even the cavemen many mi l- lions of years ago must ’ ve known the pla nets are orbiting the Sun — simply by watching the clear night sky and counting the days between consecutive retrogrades or elongations, heliacal or acronycal risings, settings etc. This is how the concept of the ephemeris evolved. We are centered in Earth ’ s sphere of e x- perience while living in this corporeal existence. The concept of seeing light at the center of the Earth is nothing new, but rather is as old as humankind. The ephemeris developed with"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 12 our lives as ancestors over ages of ages. You see it ’ s th e concept of the ephemeris which has evolved with mans experiences. From our conceptual geocentric observatory, we “ see ” the house - cusps and positions of the planets thereto our eye which sees in all directions simultan e ously. Daily trans actions occur by t he relatively slow planetary motion in relatively fast - moving meridian houses for which “ pr i- mum mobile ” gets its name, meaning the fas t est - moving zodiac, since Earth rotates full circle in just one sidereal day. This is what distinguishes our first attunem ent which is stationary with our caelestial sphere, and second attune - ment which is stationary with Earth. In this first sense, we see the Earth rotating from our conceptual ge o centric view against the relatively stationary caelestial sphere. In the secon d sense we view our caelestial sphere rotate relative to our stationary Earth. Same point of view but one is fixed to our caelestial sphere while the other is fixed to our terrestrial sphere. Both views are from the same conceptual point in space at the ge ocenter of Earth. The tie that binds our first and second terrestrial view together is the ecliptic which is our caelestial equator, and Earth ’ s equator of rotation, our terre s trial equator. It is after all the ecliptic intersection with the cusps of Earth ’ s meridians which define the boundaries of each astrological house relative to each meridian of activity. Similarly, it is the ecliptic longitude of planets which determines their actual positions in the meridian houses. Of course the whole Earth is conti nuously active, so the infinite set of meridians which r a diate outward from the geocenter circumscribe the planet — out to the prote c tive radiation shield of the Van Allen Belt, beyond which any conventional transport of living organisms is impossible, les t those lifeforms be quickly irradiated into oblivion under the sering, radioactive rays of an unforgi v- ing Sun. Hence, the boundary of Earth ’ s houses is clearly defined, as the plane of houses & planets is clearly the ecliptic which “ wobbles ” slightly over the long - term, but for the short - term mean Earth - Sun plane as used in the ephemeris, at any given moment that plane is merely two - dimensional, meaning it is a concept which has no corporeal exi s tence. Thus the tilt of Earth ’ s rotational axis to the eclipt ic highlights the astrological associ a tions wrought between our earthly existence and the influence of the planetary Gods which “ sing ” in the horoscope. This varies not only by the relatively slow planetary motions over the course of a day, but also by rel ative time of day to a meridian of local activity. The greater the obli q- uity of rotation, the greater the magnitude of house - cusp oscillation with its proportional co n- sequence, ergo horoscopic dissonance. But the relatively continuous sidereal orbits of pl anets are more natural, and would bring harmony to a horoscope throughout the day from their synodic positions to Earth. The more upright Earth becomes in her heliocentric orbit, the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 13 more astrological ha r mony is achieved, and the Earth becomes more stable and firm under the caelestial sphere. This helps us to recognize what a horoscope is: an event centered on a geographic loc a tion under the divine power of the Gods. It ’ s not nearly so much the location as the activity itself which empowers the horoscope of the same. When you consider that the whole Earth is e s- sentially of one activity, then the first attunement is the sum total of the whole in the colle c tive sense. But the horoscopic regions of Earth ’ s activity are subsets of the whole, as are smaller and s maller subsets with their relationships among all various energies of earthly exi s- tence...vastly too complex for man to ever hope to quantify and qualify, much less synthesize into his u n derstanding of astrology. Fortunately for the judicial astrologer, it is the focus of an event which is readily calc u lated then adjudicated. If the event is centered on a specific time and location, then that data is used for that specific event. If it is more of a general calendar date than time, the horoscope favors the h ierarchic pr e dominance of rulerships therein, hence the “ daily ” horoscope is tied to that event at the location in question. As you see, the event is intrinsic to the value or infl u ence awarded its horoscope, such as Joan of Arc being burnt at the stake. N o small event and no small horoscope. 1E05:15 49N26:34 9am LAT May 30 1431: Neptune on the Ascendant, Uranus has transited midheaven. 9 AM LAT was 8:57:35am LMT (8:53:15 UT). Venus tra n- sited the cusp 8:52:29am LMT (8:48:08 UT), for a difference of just fiv e minutes. Hence Joan ’ s time of death is awarded 8:55am on account of Venus ruling seventh house, Mercury ruling sixth Jupiter fallen therein, Uranus fallen fifth house, Moon exalts second house, Neptune e x- alts ninth as Pluto rules eighth house. Fortune fo urth house as Vertex conjuncts Spirit under Moon & Saturn aloft. Lilith tenth, Node third, Mars eleventh house at 0.7022808 AU rece d- ing. Joan ’ s natal sojourn was Neptune just after sunset, with fortune debilitate third house on January 6 1412 5E40:31 48N26 :35. It would appear that Joan ’ s soul returned home upon her flaming death at Place du Vieux Marche in Rouen. That brave soul ’ s next incarnation was predicated on the horoscope at Joan ’ s demise — just as all discarnate souls had each appointed their previous incarnation ’ s time and place to die accor d ing to choices made and actions taken in their lives as ancestors, and by learning experiences throughout the process of life and death, and souljourns among the heavenly universities in departures ad interim. In some cases, ones planetary souljourn may last seconds, but for most it is years, or even de c ades, rarely longer. It ’ s each soul ’ s aggregate experiences among the heavens beyond the Earth which defines and empowers those forces for that soul - incarnate, and always in real - time.

This is willpower, and is stronger than any collective astrological force in souls who have developed that consciou s ness by practicing and asserting their Dominion in the living temple of the soul and body; that is the indomitable a ssertion of responsible freedom, as the proverbial benevolent dictator over ones own life. In contrast, those who think, speak or act irresponsibly are lacking in wisdom and more readily succumb under the astrological forces. They ’ ve usurped their own will power, and are continually drawn down into the darker realms of Hades, in rebellion against Judgment which is inevitable. Such souls are damned by their own irresponsible actions. Unable to learn from their own mistakes, they are doomed to suffer the most dire consequences for their evi l doing. Hence the horoscope, ones astrologic theme of life, will be used as a force for good by the soul who would accept responsibility for it. Each planet in the n a tal chart is a God who wields tremendous powers over the en tire Earth. It i s n ’ t like we say “ I ’ m going to exercise my free - will so I won ’ t have to worry about powers and principalities of the world neither about the power of the Gods against me personally ” . Differe n tiation of will in the equations of life skirts t he subliminal threshold of co n sciousness. The soul inhabits an awesomely complex living body in an equally miraculous enviro n- ment. One dimension is nonexis - tent. Two dimensions is no n existent. Three dimensions is the basis of the universe. For the first h eaven to exist it must be three - dimensional — at least. The tenth heaven is at least twelve - dimensional, beginning with the third. The first two d i- mensions occur only in consciousness but not in corporeal existence. The third dimension is built on top of the first two, and is the third attunement, as sim i larly built upon the first two consciousnesses: that of the single point, and the infinite set of points of a line or infinite set of lines along a plane. A plane has no z - axis and therefore does not corporea lly exist. See? The line is the bridge between first & second dimensions. Think of the point as 0, the line as 1, and a plane as 2. leaving 3 to number our three - dimensional world. A point is still a point, inferring an absence of width, breadth or height. Absence of what? It ’ s a very abstract concept, one without dimension but which must reference dimension in order to be acknow l- edged as a point. Food for thought. The extension of consciousness into this third dimension is, by the elements of creation, cre ated by the creative forces of God the creator and sustained by the sustenant forces of God the sustainer, and destroyed by the forces of God the destroyer — ergo the cardinal, fixed & mutable courtyards of the four el e mental triplicities. Existence is the d istinction between the first two attunements and the third. Thus the ten consciousnesses of existence and the el e- me n tal forces interacting in this solar system is the most fundamental understanding of jud i- cial astrology which can be attained, as to marry m et a physics & quantum physics.

It ’ s difficult to imagine seeing caelestial lights from a none xi s- tent point at the center of the Earth. The light itself is nonexistent at that point. Our point has no perimeter, no volume, nor space - time. There ’ s nothing but the concept of the ephemeris ergo the concept of the caelestially - then terrestrially - fixed geocentric points for attunement 1 and 2. One in the same conceptual point. Armed with this understanding, then the relevance of the light - apparent radial and synodic motions of the planets along the conceptual plane of the ecliptic, to the focus of activi ty as “ seen ” from our conceptual observatory at our ephe m- eris geocenter, is astrologically self - defining. In the next chapter, the third dimension of existence is introduced into the horoscopic equation of life. Judging specific event and location horoscop es will be the topic."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" C HAPTER 3 T HE THIRD ATTUNEMENT is three - dimensional existence, and integrates the knowledge expl i- cated in previous chapters in which our conceptual first and second dimensions were syste m- atically correlated with the basics of astrono my & astrology, pertaining to radial & sy n odic motions of the planets to Earth and concepts of the planetary ephemeris. Essentially, mans ever - evolving concepts begin on our 3D planet, experiencing, obser v ing, inventing & formulating mathematical models to help us pr e dict the past & future of what we observe in reality. For the basic ephemeredes of ancient and antediluvian astronomers, calc u- lating and predicting planetary motion was likely confined to round degrees of ecliptic long i- tude over integer solar d ays in most common cases, so that it was easy to do and easy to teach anyone who wanted to learn — as ancient astronomers were as common then as mediocre gu i- tar players are today. With the tilt of Earth ’ s axis, the Moon ’ s been repeating her phases about ever y 29 to 30 days, Mercury 116, Venus 584, Mars 780, Jupiter 400, Saturn 378; with retrogrades lasting about 22 days for Mercury, 42 for Venus, Mars 73, Jupiter 121, & Saturn 138. This was obv i- ous to ever y body. Just as obvious was that V e nus orbited closer t o the Sun than Earth did with Mercury closer to the Sun than Venus, and Mars orbited further from the Sun than Earth. Phases of the Moon became lunar months of alternating 30 and 29 days each. It took almost 4 Moons for Mercury ’ s phase to return to its app arent position to the Sun; about 19 and 3/4 Moons for V e- nus; under 26 & 1/2 Moons for Mars; 13 & 1/2 Moons for Jupiter with Saturn a little over 12 & 3/4 Moons to repeat its predictable phases. Mercury was hard to see and erratic in its orbit, so that pred icting days for Mercury ’ s phases was accurate over the long - term but was som e- times off by a few days, from like - phase to like - phase. To correct for long - term discrepancies, the witty astronomer would add or subtract a day for counting many repetitions of any planet ’ s phase. The repeating shadows on rigid stone formations be they natural or modified by man, showed the tropical year to be about 365 & 1/4 days long. That meant that every four tropical years was made of about 1461 days...and the repea t ing shad ows proved it. Such observations were discussed at tribal council, over decades and centuries of observ a- tion. New ideas over how to calibrate or improve the ever - more reliable ephemeris reco g nized the many periodic multiples of the astronomic cycles as ecl ipses & nodes, the tropical & sid e- real year, anomalistic, draconic, synodic months, eclipse seasons & solar tota l ity, planet - planet & planet - star conjunctions and occultation series, trop i cal precession etc. For the five planets of evening & morning, they were observed to have very long - term, sid e real/synodic/tropical multiples:"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 17  Mercury 85 mean - synodic periods =~ 27 tropical years; 191 sidereal ~ 145 mean - synodic ~ 46 tropical  Venus 157 mean - synod ic periods =~ 251 tropical years; 1871 sidereal ~ 720 mean - synodic ~ 1151 tropical  Mars 22 mean - synodic periods =~ 47 tropical years 151 sidereal ~ 133 mean - synodic ~ 284 tropical  Jupiter 76 mean - synodic periods =~ 83 tropical years 36 sidereal ~ 391 mean - synodic ~ 427 tropical  Saturn 57 mean - synodic periods =~ 59 tropical years 9 sidereal ~ 256 mean - synodic ~ 265 tropical The ancient Mayans and Babylonia ns counted such periodic events with fine accuracy. The Babylonians predicted the corrections for orbital eccentricity, inclination, nodal prece s sion etc to hexadecimal fractions of a degree. The Mayans predicted super long - term values, even pr e- cession. Th e ancient M a yan haab intercalation interval using 1508 haabs per 1507 tropical years (C.P. Bowditch, pub. 1906) shows that Mayan astronomers knew that the trop i cal year averaged 365.2422 solar days over the long - term. Further - more they knew that it took s ome 9,360,000 solar days to complete 1 sidereal gyration of tropical precession. The archaeoastr o- nomical evidence for the a n cient astronomers knowing much more about the universe than our modern - day secular scientists have acknowledged is incontrovertible. This is important since modern astronomers & astrologers have been misled by secular academia into believing that astronomy & astrology is something relatively “ new ” when in fact the cavemen of many millions of years BC watched the night sky, and meditate d on their place in the world. Even since the tilt of Earth ’ s axis, Cayce said the best understanding of mans earthly existence was as the great teacher Amilius understood it, emphasizing his rule r ship: “ (Q) Please give a description of the earth ’ s surfac e as it existed at the time of Atlantis ’ highest civilization, using the names of con - tinents, oceans and sections of same as we know them today? (A) As to the highest point of civil i- zation, this would first have to be determined according to the standard as to which it would be judged - as to whether the highest point was when Amilius ruled with those understandings, as the one that understood the variations, or whether they became man made, would d e pend upon whether we are viewing"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 18 from a spiritual standp oint or upon that as a purely material or commercial standpoint; for the variations, as we find, extend over a period of some two hundred thousand years (200,000) - that is, as light years - as known in the present - and that there were many changes in the surface of what is now called the earth. ” - Reading 364 - 4 So, those who have been taught to believe that astronomy & astrology are somehow new to the world are misinformed. Cayce also says astrology is at least as old as the book of Job, which is by far th e oldest book in the Bible. As Moses was born circa 1900 BC, Job goes back much further in time. How much further is probably older than anybody would care to ente r- tain. How any book could survive that long is unfathomable; it must have held universal a p- pe al. Recognition that attunement with God the Creator is what astrology is originally intended to promote, that is the crown of judicial acumen. Astrology is not some “ fortune telling ” art i- fice for charlatans, but is ones attunement with the providential au thority of creation, life i t- self. The certainty of highly - predictable planetary motions is the assurance of astronomical predictions & calculations. Astrological deductions are adjudged by these assu r ances, and it is the law by which said judgments are pro nounced. The planetary ephemeris is our conceptual model built on long ages of nocturnal observ a- tion, connecting existence with concepts about that existence. How quickly the ephe - meris would morph and our perceptions of it be di s torted in the absence of astronomical vigilance. Mans awareness of the pla n ets and his conceptual models of their motion is intrinsically allied with the lights on our celestial sphere. While diurnal parallax almost imperceptibly osci - llates from zero at the local meridian of obs ervation to the maximum triangulated base line of Earth ’ s radius, it is nevertheless accounted for in the ephemeris by taking into account time, location, pressure, humidity, etc. of reported o b servations. In ancient times, observations on the local meridi an at the time of transit was sufficient to assure reliable geocentric coordinates of the planets and fiducial stars, thereby assuring ancient astronomers across the globe that due diligence was taken. No wonder the Mayans, Babylonians, et al were such exc ellent astro - nomers, predicting the past & future planetary positions with awesome accuracy and consi s- tency. The astrologer is then charged with his or her inherent duty to look up at the night sky on occasion, and see for yourself that the planets are in deed where you would expect they should be. Know that the sunlight which illuminates the bright limb of planets and is r e flected back to the observer is what bears corporeal witness to that planet ’ s position on the caelestial sphere and synodic phase to Ea rth relative to the Sun.

Contrarily, those who are careful to diet and eat modest portions of healthy foods like fresh raw veget a bles and fruits, while avoiding heavy man - made or processed foods as often as you possibly can, fast on occasion & do whatever chores you have dutifully without fail; avoid any and all forms of drugs — like you ’ d avoid the plague, and generally, live to serve your fellow man by nurturing and developing w hatever gifts God has given you, those persons have asked for divine gui d- ance and so will obtain it. Everyone ’ s born with a true gift to give, but only a few ever learn to nurture, develop and refine their God - given gifts for lack of self - discipline. Those who are willing to learn must also be willing to work at it. That ’ s why secular - religious fanatics aren ’ t able to learn about the occult sciences: they ’ re simply too lazy and undisciplined to do the work it takes to develop any understanding of it. It ’ s m uch easier for them to remain imm a- ture and illiterate very much to their own detriment. It ’ s imperative to ask for God ’ s help and to declare the intent of your request, asking once and once only in all earnest, and that ’ s it. The wheels are set in motion. Do not ask again. If you asked God to help you to help your fellow man, then in your learning to help others, you ’ ll be learning to help yourself. So be careful what you ask for — and be prepared to devote your life to your calling. It is, after all, your di vine elective. That ’ s your gift. The Gods will use your gift for their divine purposes as your supplication has warranted albeit not as you expect, but you must still do the work and develop your skill to its fullest.

You ’ re here to serve God, not the other way around, as a judicial astrologer will know. As you draw upon the first two attunements with the Gods, then the third attunement b e- gins to “ speak ” its language in the 3D worlds of your experience. As the solar system formed, so formed the ten spheres of consciousness which governs its evolution. Out of these ten heavens, man was eventually brought into material being as descendants of of the same. The first heaven, the Moon, empo wers Somnus and Morpheus, sleep and dreams. While medical and occult - related research, theories and practical applications on these subjects are volum i- nous, humankind has always held a tremendous interest in and regard for sleep and dreams. A healthy pers on tends to sleep more regularly, dreaming more actively & beneficially as a r e sult. Edgar Cayce is probably the greatest advocate and educator on the power of dreams in recorded history. His Uranian souljourn was in part to thank for his attunement with t hat co l- lective inspiration: the universal sustenance of electromagnetic consciousness on the bass o c- tave of the lunar foundation of the Moon, whose ensign Cancer is creative weak forces, or collective unco n scious. Cayce ’ s self - induced hypnosis enabled him to access this aggregate experiential collec - tive at will, running the gamut of the planetary spheres, psychically “ downloading ” data as the patient or subject allowed or warranted. Differentiating between sources of data d e pended on the person or persons involved. E.g., a remote viewing or reading of a patient often hu n dreds or thousands of miles away required no more than a name and geographic location for Cayce ’ s active subconscious mind to co n nect with the patient ’ s own subconscious mind. The contrast between terms like “ un ” or “ sub ” co n scious gets blurred among secular academia, since they don ’ t see the un - conscious as active and readily available to the mind, but as mental processes “ hidden ” from the conscious mind, hence the term “ o c- cult ” . Such defin i tions are antiquated, and are easily clarified. What the worldly academy calls “ conscious ” means to be fully, or at least signif i cantly, awake in the physical body, equating the individual mind with ind i vidual brain function which is strictly limited to i ndividual brain capacity and developed ther e under by experience, education, & overall accomplishments in life. That ’ s fine, but the differences between “ awakeness ” and “ awareness ” are where those secularly - inclined and those occultly - inclined part company.

I wish them all the luck. They can ’ t even figure out si m ple things, like how light can traverse this cosmic radius from deep field galaxies allegedly fifteen billion years older than the Milky Way . They claim these aeons - old galaxies skirt the early edge of the “ big bang ” . Alright, if that ’ s the case, then how could they explain the innumerable galaxies at isotropic opposition? They don ’ t even u n- derstand that Earth is the center of her caelestial s phere, and yet they ’ ll tell us that Earth is not at the center of the universe...do you see the problem here? They can point the powerful hu b- ble space telescope in any direction from nearby Earth orbit and see the light from fifteen bi l- lion year - old galaxi es. Or these may be closer to ten, or perhaps twenty billion years old, depending on how all this data is inte r preted. If the universe were only ten billion or twenty trillion years old isn ’ t the issue here. Rather it ’ s the point of origin — assuming there was one. The fact that the cosmos appears virtually the same in all directions, with older ga l axies apparently thirty - billion lightyears apart with Earth at the central focus of observation, you see, then that light had to travel for a period of fifteen b illion years in order to be seen from Earth in our pr e sent time. Ay, there ‘ s the rub: those well - formed ancient galaxies had to have been fifteen billion lightyears distant from Earth ’ s present position relative in the grand continuum. From our present - d ay Earth, we ’ re seeing light from deep field light sources at isotropic opposition some fifteen billion years ago. I.e., the position in space which the Earth is pre s- ently occupying was co n temporaneous fifteen billion years ago. Meaning, irrespective of th e velocity of light, space itself is the medium through which light traverses. What then is the “ velocity ” of space? It must be the same as light, or secular cosmology is in trouble. They can claim that time - space itself is created as part of this big bang process, and that sounds reaso n- able but still doesn ’ t e x plain how light can travel through space if space doesn ’ t move with light or what made space stop moving with light in the first place. Either way, no one can show how light 15 billion years old is a t opposition to the relative p o sitions in space of the local observer, unless they say the observer is near the big - bang center. Take their “ inflating balloon ” theory where an expanding universe appears isotropic no matter where you are in it. If this is t he case, then even those along its available energy boun d- ary must still be able to view the isotropic universe. For this to be true then our inflating ba l- loon must be infinite in size, utterly boundless, with lights upon lights at infinite distance from an y point in space for all we know. If their “ tired light ” theory has merit, then light rays may not be able to survive nor penetrate the vast chasms of outer space, as the light is di f- fused, absorbed, reflected, refracted, bent by gravity or other influence s of which secular sc i- ence has yet to recognize."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 22 I bet you could go anywhere in the universe and it would still look isotropic. William of Ockham ’ s “ razor ” favors my wager. First, to impos e limits on what God can or can not do would be vain foolishness.

What we see from Earth looks is o tropic and that ’ s a fact. It ’ s no theory, but is strictly an observational reality. What we can see from Earth is but an infinitesimal slice of infi n ity. The lights on the Earth ’ s caelestial sphere are limited only by how far any light can travel through space. A theoretically perfect vacuum might pe r mit light to continue forever, but alas, t he universe is much more than empty space — indeed. But rather than come right out and admit that secular science has no idea of how old or how large the universe truly is, they champion their pet theories as if they were proven fact, which they are not. Sim ilarly, conceptual integration of factual observation with astrological deduction r e quires discipline and prac tice. So be watchful. Don ’ t become entangled in traps of conve n ient self - deception as the secular scientists have invariably done. All occult scie nce is worthy of no less scrutiny than all secular science. Use scientific method. It ’ s not enough to merely claim to have critical thought processes well under control but one must demonstrate it in order to survive the unforgiving test of time. Myriad se cular and occult scientists have posited theories over the ages which fail the test of reality. Take necr o- mancy for example. A mundane, pentagramic circle of protection is not truly needed. In a n- cient times, spirit mediumship and necromancy was an everyday occurrence. While helpful spirits can help you, harmful spirits can harm you. It ’ s good to request a s sistance of helpful benevolent spirits, but it ’ s bad to conjure malevolent hell ’ s a n gels up from Tartaros. James van Praagh for example, shares his ideas about what makes a helpful spirit medium. His ability to contact dearly departed souls for the solitary intent of helping the next of kin is an incontr o- vertible matter of record. He ’ s done this in lieu of aboriginal enchantment or superficial n e- cromantic a ccessories. Spirits who fall ominously between benevolence and malevolence, “ mothman ” types, if you will, they can be both harmful and helpful depending on who ’ s doing the looking. Clearly any intent to protect yourself from harm must accord your desire to help others, just as any intent to benefit yourself must submit to the same golden rule.

At least several thousand deaths and more than two hundred thousand serious injuries occurred as a r e sult. With majo r event charts such as this, is is good to consider the imm e diate and direct effect which it had on the collective populace of the region in question, as calculated according that event ’ s central location. This is obviously the epicenter for a major earthq uake. Judge the significance of an event when interpreting its chart. As you ’ ll find with many natal horoscopes, time of birth is not always within a five or ten minute window of exac - t i tude. Beginning with the worst - case scenarios, neither date of birth, year of birth nor place of birth is known. Take jolly ole St. Nick for example. Nicholas, bishop of Myra, is believed to have been born in Patara, Lycia, in southern Asia Minor. But his year of birth is unknown to history, estimated circa 250 AD, since he died c. 350 AD, and was b e- lieved to be at least 95 to 105 years old when he died. His time of birth is unknown. Nicholas is known for his demonstrative charitability & jovial disposition, and his great love of chi l- dren. That ’ s a Jupiter sojourn, we can be sure of that. But any hor o scope is speculation. And how about Alexander t he Great? Definitely a Sun soul journ, as everybody in the Greek world knew he was a son of Apollo, but beyond that we can only speculate. We can be sure that some proficient a s trolog ers cast horoscopes for the great Alexander in his short and bright lifetime, but these ancient charts are assuredly lost to antiquity. In ancient times, a person ’ s souljourn was understood as the most venerated of astrolog i cal qualities, above horo - scopi c aspects revealed in a natal chart. But horoscopes were noneth e- less understood to affect mortal destiny and to paint ones portrait in the stars. Gaius Julius Caesar was openly proud of his family ’ s Venusian heritage, thus Caesar ’ s souljourn was almost cer tainly V e nus. His place of birth was probably in Rome. His year of birth was 102, 101 or 100 BC, most say 100. His date of birth is likely July 13th (ante diem III Idus Quinctilis). Time of birth? In Rome on 13 July 100 BC, Venus arose about 6:15 AM LAT, a nd transited midheaven around 1:25 PM LAT. But we can ’ t be sure of the year. That makes this horoscope fun to do but is still too speculative. Suffice that Julius Caesar was descended from Venus. Fort u nately in our day and age, date and time of birth is mo re frequently known in first world countries. Even in places like England, where time may not appear on ones birth certificate, but photos and letters, testimonies from family and friends, etc., this often reveals some hour of day that the birth took place , leaving the judicial astrologer to rectify the horoscope. Take a modern example, like Elizabeth Kubler - Ross. First - born of triplets, this famed Death & Dying guru was born in Zurich, Switzerland 8 - Jul - 1926 at either 10:15 PM MET or an half hour later at 10:45. What prompted the change in Kubler ’ s own me m ory of her birthtime is unclear. I ’ ve seen other such cases, such as George Harrison, where he changed his mind rather late in his life as to what time he was born by almost half an hour. Harrison ’ s"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 26 own b irth certificate reads 12:10 AM (GWT) according to his mother, who said that ’ s why she would call him every year on his birthday (25 - Feb - 1943) at 12:10 AM to bid him a good one.

I ’ ve done his birth & death chart and he was born ~12:05, so the 12:10 BC time was either a slightly fast clock or was written down just minutes after George was breat h ing. As for the two - pound newborn Liz Kubler, Zuric h is 47N23 8E32. 10:15 AM (21:15 UT) shows Jupiter on the Ascendant, with no other planets in the a n gle, so Jupiter is easily her souljourn, and Kubler ’ s speculative “ 10:45 ” is wrong.

What follows is exemplary of such paralleli sm which has affected the lives of many mi l lions of people. Consider the remarkable comparison of Abe Lincoln & JFK, which I ’ ve copied & r e- dacted from some popular websites: Lincoln elected to Congress: 1846. Kennedy elected to Co ngress: 1946. Lincoln elected President: 1860. Kennedy elected President: 1960. Lincoln promoted civil rights. Kennedy promoted civil rights. Lincoln ’ s and Kennedy ’ s wives lost their children while living in the White House. Lincoln & Kennedy both shot on a Friday. Lincoln & Kennedy both shot in the head. Lincoln & Kennedy both shot in the imme - diate presence of their wives, and both were shot in the presence of the public. Lincoln & Kennedy were warned by their Se - cretaries not to go to Ford ’ s Theater, or to ride in the open motorcade (in Dallas). Lincoln ’ s Secretary was named Kennedy. Kennedy ’ s Secretary wa s named Lincoln. Lincoln was assassinated by a Southerner. Kennedy was assassinated by a Southerner. Lincoln was succeeded by a Southerner. Kennedy was succeeded by a Southerner. Andrew Johnson, b. 1808, succeeded Linc oln. Lyndon Johnson, b. 1908, succeeded Kennedy. John Wilkes Booth, b. 1839, shot Lincoln . Lee Harvey Oswald, b. 1939, shot Kennedy. (well, not really, but...) John Wilkes Booth was known by his full name. Lee Harvey Oswald was kn own by his full name.

Each psyche is born of the heavenly spheres both individually and collectively as a whole. In the beginnings of our solar system ’ s dev - elopment, the vessels of G od took shape in their o r- bits, eventually becoming stable enough to support life under the unrelenting power and su s- tenance of our central Sun. While Earth is our only planet presently supporting any human beings or animal life of any kind, Mars certainly used to, and yet it takes the entire s o lar system to be supportive for these life - forms to exist anywhere in it. Each of the ten heavens is paradisiacal, but all ten of our planets functioning in harmony together is Paradise. Star Trek creator Gene Roddenb erry (b. 19 - Aug - 1921 1:35 AM MST 106W29 31N45, d. 24 - Oct - 1991 time? 118W29 34N01) envisioned a “ prime directive ” that strictly prohibited interfe r ence with the natural evolution of a developing culture which generally entailed an entire solar system with a planet or two inhabited by that emerging culture. Starfleet was free to visit such emerging cultures, but could not interfere with their innate state of progress. If a culture was too primitive, Starfleet was invisible. This was hardly a novel idea, but i s more anthrop o logic in nature. For example, scientists who study relatively primitive cultures, like tribes of the uncharted Amazon jungles and other similarly isolated regions around the world, such studies have inevitably tempted the curious to see how the tribesmen react to a plane or hel i copter, polaroid camera, two - way radio or anything else that is certain to be threatening or shocking to souls who know nothing of the outside world. Given our recent advances in emerging supertechnologies like digital wireless and nanotech, biotech, cybernetics, genetics etc, no one in his or her right mind would dare expose a primitive man, woman or child to such self - indulgent abuse of our “ PD ” . Uninte n- tional exposure, like a high - flying jet crossing the sky, is a lo ng way from inflicting intentional harm. That ’ s not saying we are forbidden to interact with the tribes who ’ ve remained insulated from outside influence, but those who would meet face to face with these people had better not frighten them with your digital wir e less, or the tribal witchdoctor is liable to give you a curse! The heavens above Earth forever exert their reigns down upon us night and day. As every soul incarnate upon the Earth or d e parted to the nine heavens above her is part of our solar system ’ s collective experience and destiny, it is then up to each individual to develop and nu r- ture his or her own understanding of the variations and what the world has varied from, and why its corrections will soon b e come noticeable. We can find the variations with - in and without, in our body and soul, and in everything around us. It is good to remember this as"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 30 you embark on the astrological jou r ney within. Like the old zen motto says, point your finger to the Moon then watch the Moon, not your finger, or you ’ l l miss all that heavenly glory (as Bruce Lee taught the young man in Enter the Dragon). The collective waters of our vast lunar subconscious is forever in motion, as set in motion from our genesis on the sixth evening - morning of our creating, exalting the Moon in Taurus by the morning of his and her appearance. Relative to the other planets, the Moon is felt to race around the Earth as a chariot pulling us along, tugging at our emotions as one would feel the unsettling motion of others so a t- tuned. Remember the purpose is to assist others. This is to become attuned with those you ’ d like to help in concert with those who will help you to help them. Where we enter into the first heaven of spiritual awareness, the phys i cal body will respond in somnolence, emotio nally drained, as the Moon & Stars rule the night and your consciousness yields under nocturnal vigilance. What happens next depends on how sensitive you are, and how well you hold up under emotional stress, so go with the flow. As you ’ re immersed in this interminable river of colle c- tive soul, you ’ ll be sure to experience deeper emotions in your physical waking state of co n- sciousness. That ’ s a good thing, since you ’ ll soon discover that it is actually permissible to laugh & cry at the same time. Not mere co medic seesawing one to the other, like those ou t- dated “ I Love Lucy ” reruns, but in fact co n currently, on the cusp of the lunar doubles (i.e., double letters). That ’ s why those who shut off their emotions are driven to madness, insanity, or what is properly termed lunacy, particularly near inferior conjunction, i.e., Full Moon. Deep emotions are beginning to surface...get used to it. Of course women express em o tion more easily than men do, so a man is apt to be ove r whelmed if he isn ’ t sensitive in the first place. Strong emotions can hurt worse than the worst physical pain, no matter how e x quisite and ex - cruciating it may be. But emotional tension is also the agent of ones spiritual deve l- opment. Be sure to tune in. As your lunar sensitivity increases, both n ight and day, then the other nine heavens will demand proportionality of your psyche, and rest assured they shall have it. It is this propo r- tion tailored to your psychic deve l opment which needs work in the least - sensitive of your planets, drawing upon the others in which you are more - sensitive. For example, those who clearly demonstrate quick - witted Me r curial intellect are borrowing from other planets in the process. Which of these Gods do you need to express more in your life? The Gods work ceas e- lessly to help us strengthen the wea k est link in the chain of our command, so that we may express the seven heavenly diatonic rays in equity, yet only to the full measure of our capacity, which is perfectly natural. As we grow, we express more, with Uranus ’ inspirat ion resonant on the bass - octave of the Moon, Ne p tune ’ s wisdom resonant on the earthquaking bass - octave of Mercury, and finally Pluto at the center of the Earth, sympathetically vibrant with Venus on"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 31 the crest of the wave. We ’ ll get to those and other plane ts in later chapters, but the Moon is just getting started. Consider the vast depths and varieties of human emotion, not least of which is to grieve the loss of a loved one. This is why sessions or seances are held to contact the dearly departed. Every cli ent wishes to know how his or her loved one(s) is doing on the other side. I ’ ve never heard an y one ask “ what ’ s it like over there, am I going to be okay after I die? ” That ’ s because it is not about oneself, but is only about that person ’ s love & concern fo r another who they dearly miss. That ’ s normal emotion, but is nonetheless extremely powerful and strongly felt. When it comes to matters of life and death, everyone is clairsentient barring full - tilt lun a- tics whose emotions are severely repressed. Those wi th more developed sensi - tivity may not yet clearly see nor clearly hear contact with spirit but can clearly sense their presence in the collective subconscious. Emotional variety can be found in everything and in every experience a person can have. I just love a good “ tear - jerker ” movie when the violins kick in. My eyes well up in tears almost uncontrollably. Every eye in the audience fights back the tears in vain. The more emotionally - insecure a person is then the less they want to be seen crying at the d rop of a hat like a pregnant woman. It ’ s good to laugh in tears and sniffle in public at the monologue of a great stand - up comedian, and it ’ s good to bawl your eyes out at a family f u- neral. If you would know the Moon, a l low your emotions to flow, since as you learn to channel more of this lunar energy in your psyche, your emotions will become more powerful, your imagination and creative abilities will noticeably increase, and your connectivity with the co l- lective sub - conscious will “ well up ” into your waki ng consciousness. Your dreams will b e- come more lucid and instructive. The changeability, inconstancy and vicissitudes of Morpheus are hypnotizing shapes with fluid contours, reminiscent of some more ancient pre - Columbian art and architecture. You don ’ t nee d to know this, as you ’ ll see it in person, i.e., your subco n- scious linked to your waking conscious - ness. Anytime you can stay awake more than two or three days in a row, you ’ ll see remarkably clear dream - images interspersed or integrated with your physic al existence, making it a challenge to distinguish one from the other. A good thirty - six hours of sleep and those dream - images will have subsided. Sleep - deprivation isn ’ t confined to wal k abouts and vision quests, but millions of people in the US, for examp le, suffer from more long - term adverse side - effects due to stressful conditions in their lives. They work too much, play too much, worry too much, thus too much of anything can b e- come ruinous to their health. There ’ s a classic tune from Commander Cody (mos t famous for “ Hot Rod Lincoln ” ) that says “ a whole lot of things I ain ’ t never done, but I ain ’ t never had Too Much Fun ” . But alas even drinking too much pure water can kill you. A few tiny drops of mercury is poiso n ous, yet mercury ’ s vital for health. No mercury at all, and your body dies. Not that the yout h ful vigor of teenagers & young adults ought to be suppressed — God forbid!"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 32 Staying up partying day and night for nights on end is best accomplished at that age. Once you ’ ve started plucking gray hairs, th at is your cue to mellow out, party less, and sleep better. Too much or not enough sleep is the recipe for disaster. The body needs sleep to cleanse and restore itself, and oversoul uses dreams to instruct us & promote qualities of soul through the channel s of the nocturnal air - waves, guided through the subconscious into mans co n- sciousness in cycles, phases, recurring and repeating dream - themes, since the infinite Uranian superconscious on the octave of the Moon is resonant with her unconscious, i.e. weak n uclear force. The divine Uranus - Moon synergy occurs in in the subconscious and rises up to the co n- scious state in phases. So our active consciousness is equally vital for health. An optimum night ’ s sleep for most adults is about 6.7 hours on average. Child ren need more, seniors less. Continued di s ruption against restorative patterns or cycles of sleep and dreams is detrimental. If that ’ s a problem for you it must be corrected. Oversleeping is just as unhealthy, so a balance must be maintained over the lunar months (averaging 29.53 days per lunar month). That ’ s about 8.5 total days or 200 hours sleep that you need from like - phase to like - phase of the Moon — as your sleep is more or less evenly distributed across solunar months in diurnal c y- cles — the o c casional sleeping in or bouts with insomnia notwithstanding. If you missed your normal “ REM ” sleep cycles one night before, you can get mostly caught up the following night pr o vided you get a good night ’ s sleep. In such cases, nearly twice the REM or rapid eye mov ement in stage one - emergent bioelectric “ alpha ” has been recorded on electroencephal o- gram (EEG). But those who suffer from chronic sleep - deprivation are not able to catch up on lost sleep, say, by sleeping in on the weekends. The best thing to do is sleep the same intervals every day a little more or less, and avoiding naps. It ’ s okay to rest during the day but not to sleep (that is unless you are like Cayce, and doing readings). If you find yourself dozing off during the wa k- ing hours, you either need to st art going to bed earlier or get up later. Co n versely, if you ’ re having a hard time getting to sleep on a regular basis, gradually reduce the hours that you sleep until you ’ ve achieved an optimum balance. In extremely rare cases, such as that of Ed Leedskal nin, seemingly boundless energy subdues their need for sleep. How? Is anyone ’ s guess. Most of us must sleep between a fourth and a third of a day for most of our adult lives. Having established regular sleeping habits, your dreams will gradually become eas ier for you to interpret. This in turn will help you to help others to interpret their dreams, since many people don ’ t sleep so regularly, and in any case aren ’ t studying to be a judicial astrol o- ger. Remember Nebuchadnezzar, and Daniel ’ s interpretation of his dream? Astrology is like that, since interpretation or contact is made via our same subconscious connection. Not one other astrologer in Babylon could tell the king his dream much less its meaning, saying “ there is not a man upon the earth who can show the king ’ s matter there - fore..there is no other who can show it before the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh...for this cause"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 33 the king...commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.

The waxing and waning permutations of h u man emotion are like those of the Moon, the happy gree t ing and sad good - bye, as the uniting and separating of o ne, same emotion, as laughing and crying share this same emotional energy at mans psychic foundation. One emotion and two aspects of one same emotion to the human psyche, hence 3 phases or faces of the Moon. The one eternally archetypal, and the two te m- por al, since one is waxing and one is waning, as evening - phase returns and morning - phase rushes forth. The breath of life is the “ tongue ” of our respirational balance between each inhale then e x- hale, birth to death. Thus the “ ah ” sound begins with our breathi ng, first in then out, the first breath of inspiration, first breath of life. And so “ a ” is the first letter of the alphabet. It ’ s our emotional respiration. The waxing energy drawn up from the subconscious into mans conscious experience oxygenates his emo tions, purging the emotional blood of carbon dioxide, so the spent vapors are exhaled to make room for his next breathing cycle — just as the physical body breathes normally, in order to keep i t self healthy. So our emotional “ lungs ” must breathe for mental health, i.e. rather than consciously fight & suppress emotional e n- ergy, it is healthier to flow with mans emotions than divert them with a dam for that levee will surely break. Your every sojourn in the Moon since creation has added up over aeons. Your pe rsonal r e- lationship with the Moon is built on the sum total of your experiences there, as soul, and your incarnated experiences here in soul - body relative to the Moon ’ s position and motion to the Earth, and more particularly to your own position on the Ear th from your first breath of life to your very last exhale. This real - time relationship of the planets to soul - body refers to the newborn ’ s first breath of air which satis - fies the parameters of its foreordained natal horoscope affecting its life until de ath — at which time and place the death horoscope reserves the departed soul ’ s future jud g ment and requisite nativity. The evening - morning of these perpetual souljourning and inca r nating cycles are the two phases of life waxing and waning, returning and ru shing forth. One eternal life and two temporal phases of that life. The first or waxing phase of eternal life begins with soul ’ s entrance into heaven — the “ new moon ” of soul. When the conditions are"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Chapter 4 34 right for that soul to be cut off and cast down to Earth for a new incarnation, then soul sep a- rates from heaven to bear the full burden of some newborn ’ s native horoscope, its personality and disp o sition, its complete human destiny. This is called the second death, the second or waning phase of soul in the phys ical body, hence rendering the aforesaid future judgment which was reserved since that soul ’ s last life - time on Earth imprinted from the moment of bodily death. This second phase of eternal life is the “ old moon ” for soul and “ new moon ” for the living bod y it now i n habits. In this sense, the infant child is the new moon of life, waxing as the child grows into adulthood — the full moon of physical life and the eternal archetype of that body. The waning moon of earthly life is from middle age thru old age, p rovided the soul - body ’ s karma doesn ’ t require premature death for whatever cause. If you ’ re fortunate enough to live past sixty years, then your life - moon is well into its waning phase. If you live to be a hundred, then your life - moon is drawing near to an other new moon, one which is exclusively reserved for the ne w born child born just seconds, hours, days after your old body dies, or perhaps decades, or maybe ten thousand years if your souljourn guides you to another solar system far beyond our own — but eve n then your soul will inevitably return. So there are two primary phases of the one eternal life. The returning or yin - phase is di s- carnate soul in heaven. How long that waxing phase takes to reach the full moon - stage is predicated on that soul ’ s future ju dgment. The oversoul, or perfect soul of souls, is the mighty judge ergo the common misconception that the self judges self. Not self, but the continually individuating will of all humans which colle c tively gestalts the will of integral soul to do the will of God the Creator — the first works. When you consider “ unto the third and fourth ge n- eration ” [Exodus 20:5 from the ten comman d ments] then we see why a psychic medium can only contact departed souls for up to three or four generations passed. We may cont act the memories of an ancient life through souls of the living, or that soul who has recently passed on, or through the latent psychometric memory in the Earth, but every soul incarnates anew before its fourth generation is expired. From the human point o f view, each new moon in the body is a newborn child, the yin - phase of soul ’ s physicality, while simultaneously passing the yang phase for the dis - carnate soul. A birth here is a death there and a death here is a birth there — the perpetual cycle or phase s of eternal life. So for every yin on Earth, there ’ s a yang in heaven, and every yin in heaven echoes yang on Earth. You can see this in a young child, brimming with spirit, pure and immaculate as the water melted from an iceberg. A new crescent Moon sets just above the evening horizon. By the time the child attains adolescence a once - simple childlike demeanor yields to greater r e sponsibility and the freedom to do good or evil that always goes with it. The Moon is well - into her first quarter, waxing gibbou s through the teen years into adulthood, with the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 35 moon ap - proaching full. The full moon of life peaks between its extremes, from about eigh t- een years to fifty - five years, or about thirty - five years of age for the healthiest of human beings. The right time for marriage & procreation begins in the late teens for most of us albeit some get an early or late start in becoming a parent. Usually in twenty years, give or take, the chi l- dren have grown and are living as adults, so the mother and father can live as l iberated adults now older and wiser, in the peak of their full moon of life, which is only now beginning to wane. These are the priv ileged years, where youthful ad vantage begins to fade as the Moon wanes, and we become more spiritually active and less phys ically active only slowly at first then more rapidly into our golden years until the twilight of our aged Moon — thus the new cycle of eternal life begins. How we interpret death is clear, hardly different from how we i n- terpret Newton ’ s laws of motion, “ unif orm motion...unless acted upon...change of momentum proportional to i m pressed force... every force or action there is always an equal & opposite reaction ” . For every waxing phase of every planet, there follows a waning phase as a result. This is most readi ly observed in the Moon ’ s repeating monthly phases, much as sadness and happ i- ness are most easily observed in human emotion. The collective unconscious is the foundation supporting the “ ladder ” upon which we climb up through the heavens, each in their side real order. But the phases or ensigns of the planets are made in their zodiacal order, so the sign Leo follows Cancer and is the subject of Chapter 5."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" C HAPTER 5 T HE POWER OF Leo is made by the Sun ’ s position to Earth in the context of the other pla n ets an d their positions to Earth at the time. It ’ s one Sun and one solar system, astrologically co m- posed of ten planets, no more no less. The majestic Sun appears from Earth to be the same size as the Moon as it ’ s four hu n dred - times more distant and is four - hund red times greater in diameter than the Moon. The Sun ’ s initial yin - phase is the soft reflected light from the planets, and the ambient light of Earth ’ s atmo - sphere. The second or morning solar phase is the direct light and sharply co n trasting shadows in b road daylight. This angle of sunlight cycles with the tropical seasons, from the tropic of capricorn up to the tropic of cancer for southerly and northerly vertical rays, respe c- tively. By the Sun we number the days, weeks, seasons and years. We live by the hours of each solar day, evening - morning. The Sun is the furnace that powers our solar system and is the only planet herein to emit light rather than ref - lect it. This gigantic nuclear power plant is literally the sustaining force of self - preservation, t he queen of wands in tarot, the sustenance of self who sustains the strong nuclear force in our solar system. At nearly 865 thousand miles in diameter the Sun actually orbits with the planets, primarily massive Jupiter, about the solar system barycenter in r e- sponse to the mutual gravitation between the Sun and the Jovian Giant, with more distant Saturn, Uranus and Neptune exerting somewhat less force on the Sun. Add the miniscule masses of smaller planets and moons, asteroids, comets, etc., then the Sun orb its anywhere from about [ - 0.021] and 2.228 solar radii from the system ’ s center of mass over a long - term average of 1.19 solar radii, with a standard deviation of 0.47 s.r, J2000 avg. Jup 1.068sr, Sat 0.586, Ura 0.180, Nep 0.335 [ref LS 13 - 14 January 1997 http://www.sunspot.noao.edu ]. It is good to know this, because it emphasizes the fact that the solar system functions as an integral unit, as each planet ’ s orbital motion testifies. Each planet has its own sun - planet bar y- center, which when combined with th e other planets makes the center of solar system mass. It ’ s fascinating to consider the spiral motion for each planet as the solar system orbits the Milky Way ’ s galac - tic barycenter \\ sgrab, helping us to understand the com - pounding of o r- bits over time, a nd how these are related in the galaxy among many myriads of other solar systems. As you see, the Sun essentially “ corkscrews ” toward the solar apex (HerA* 7Sag20 ’ 52.9 ” +53:26 ’ 01 ” J2000) in its galactic orbit along with the planets ’ spacious helices. The M oon and other planets ’ phases of waxing and waning, returning and rushing forth, is sunlight reflected from bright limbs contrasting to dark — in the softened sense. It ’ s the li t- urgy of the Sun, i.e. lesser light of night albeit the Moon, and even Venus ca n be seen in da y- light as the Sun radiates his light, warmth and splendor into the world. So it is said Apollo vanquishes the darkness, as he scatters the bolts of Jupiter upon all mortal men."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 37 Yet the fiery, more asperated light of the Sun scorches the Eart h, sending his unremitting power needed for the three brothers Zeus, Poseidon & Hades to bring droughts and floods on the Earth, hurricanes, tornados, hail and lightning with all extremes of weather around the globe. The Sun powers the hidden fires far ben eath the surface, which in turn feeds massive volcanos and earthquakes as the Sun inflames such plague - stricken regions with fire and fa m- ines. Apollo ’ s muse Melpomene is that of Tragedy not without cause (play the Dorian scale from D - to - D up and down, then pick out some melodies to hear Melpomene sing in the m e- lodic minor of her “ tragic ” Dorian scale). The Sun ’ s Dorian muse sings in a melodic minor modality, having the natural - sixth compared to the Moon ’ s Aeolian flatted - sixth of Klio ’ s nat u- ral minor. Both sing in the minor mode and are distinguishable by a semitone on the sixth of each diatonic scale. Twins, yes, Identical, no. We live by and bask in the warming solar light, whereas the burning light of the Sun h u- mans can barely tolerate as a species, depen ding on the abundance or scarcity of potable water more than anything else. Just as the Moon & Stars of night channel the superconscious through the subconscious while we ’ re asleep, the daytime Sun is the part of mans days to be physically active and consc ious so that what we ’ ve learned in our sleep can be revealed or a p- plied to our conscious life amid physical activity. Of course not all people sleep at night, but most of us do, as has always been the case since prehistoric times. This is because daylight makes it far easier to see and to stay warm. The cold darkness of night draws man into the safety of his abode. Notably, those active at night who sleep in the day for years on end, they will suffer from more health ailments and have a si g- nificantly shor te r lifespan than their average daylight - active counter parts. Physiological “ ci r- cadian ” rhythm associated with daily regulation of the body ’ s metabolism, sleeping and glandular cycles, is the diurnal clock of Earth ’ s solar day. Daily rhythms are inherent to all living organisms, which in the case of man, helps him to sleep nights and be active during the daytime, since that ’ s how the body of a human being is best designed to survive and thrive. There are circumstances when humans must maintain vigil at nights , but the circadian clock of Earth ’ s solar day is as fixed and sure as the Sun will rise every morning. Our chronic nightowls eventually pay the physical price for their nocturnal pursuits as the world keeps turning. The twinship of the Sun & Moon, made ap parent by nearly equal synodical size during t o- tality of a solar eclipse, includes their yin - yang quality relative to evening and morning, with both Sun & Moon “ yin ” at night and “ yang ” in daylight, differentiating between fem i- nine/masculine sidereal princ iples of planets and their synodic aspect to the Earth. The Moon is innately feminine, the Sun is masculine, yet both exert yin & yang power to the Earth in reference to their respective solar - day rule: by the phases of the Sun, evening and morning of the solar - day, and phases of the Moon, evening and morning of waxing & waning. The"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Chapter 5 38 Moon ’ s bright limb increases in the evening with each new moon, then decreases in the mor n- ing, with each full moon. Hence the morning of the Moon begins at sunset with each full moon preceding the morning of the Sun. As the Moon wanes, she moves closer to sunrise and shares more of the daylight hours with her twin brother, until the old crone is consumed u n- der the splendid rays of the Sun with the assu r ance of being born anew to the Earth ’ s evening skies. These relationships of the Sun & Moon to the Earth are unique, the Sun sidereal to Earth, and the Moon both sidereal and synodic to Earth with re - spect to the Sun — the gen e- sis of the day of the Sun and the day of the Moon relat ive to Earth. Ancient creation accounts from around the world break it down pristinely, recognizing that all of the planets and their moons are perpetually half - sunlit, and half in the shadows of the Sun in stark contrast to the constant solar illuminance, hence the division of evening & morning for the planets. From this sidereal division comes the synodic phases of the planets to Earth, or evening & morning with respect to the geocentric observer under that sphere of control, i.e. moving with the Earth in real - time while all other planets are moving to the Earth in their synodic a s pect. These are temporal aspects of the planets, drawing upon the eternal light of the Sun with parts of that eternal light reflected in all directions away from the planets. And because planets are roughly spherical in shape, the unabsorbed or reflected rays of sunlight radiate in all dire c- tions from the sunlit hemispheres of those heavens. As Earth orbits the Sun, that whole sunlit disc of each planet is fully visible only at so lar opposition, which for Mercury & Venus is impossible to see from the Earth, but as with every planet, is forever in view of the Sun. The slight orbital inclinations of the planets Mars and beyond, a l though Pluto ’ s ecliptic is about 17.1 degrees inclined to Earth ’ s ecliptic, this makes it possible to see almost but not completely all of the sunlit side of any of the planets from Earth, unless the opposition is coincident with crossing the momentary plane of Earth ’ s ecli p- tic as “ wi t nessed ” at the geocenter of observation. The clear concurrence between the light we see with our physical eyes and the light we see with our psychic eye (i.e. having eyes all around), this is the assurance of planetary m o tion, the certainty of ephemeris prediction based long ages of practical experience with astr o nomic observation of the planets via their synodic motions to Earth compounding over about two hundred thousand years since the variations began. Our ephemeris is that light eternally vis i- ble at the center of the Earth. W hile the Sun functions as central conductor of the plan e tary sym - phony, the compositions which the orchestra pe r forms is the function of the central sphere of activity which is the Earth for all human beings and all animal lifeforms herein our solar syste m.

Throughout this contiguous experience of soul with body under the synodic phases and a s trological influences of the planets then soul without the body beyond the Earth to the ete r- nal realm of the heavens, this cycle of life and death has been building under the Sun from the fall, since soul is eternal but the body is temporal. In this tem poral experience under the Sun, the harsh aspects of the sering solar rays have indelibly scarred our memory with harmful s o- lar radiation or else not enough to keep us warm, the extremes of sunlight malignantly affec t- ing the fallen man ’ s experiences throug h seven ages of ages (Fri 22 Apr 177,376 BC Gregorian to Fri 21 Dec 2012 AD), although not fully corrected until by or before 2331 AD for all those hoping to see the “ Second Advent ” by 2012. I reiterate, that ’ s the seven diatonic modes transposed across th e twelve chromatic tones, in this case, of the tropical or seasonal variations under the Sun — as Cayce called “ reasons or se a- sons of thought ” [ref. 398 - 2], the benefic or adverse aspects of seasons, as fall & winter is fo l- lowed by spring & summer, dying off and returning via a new incarnation. This is eleme n tary to the causes by which we observe tropical years & ages of precession, as 780,000 solar days is 2135.57 tropical years per age. Consider the Sun ’ s exalting a s pect at the first of Mars, the tropical mo nth of Aries, in which days begin to get longer than the nights and new life begins springing up. The year is divided first at the equinoxes, then at the solstices. Life is born on the winter solstice. Life is budding at the vernal equinox. Life is at its vertex on the summer solstice. Life then dies at the fall equinox. At this death of life hope begins, hope of life eternal. Of course the transitions b e- tween these cardinal points of the year are fluid and dynamic, but man has numbered the ages of precessi on from his fall, the beginnings of death, from the autumnal equinox, which begins the hope of Venus and exaltation of Saturn at the month of Libra. In the superior or evening seasonal aspect of life, the debilitate Sun takes its days wearied, lower in the sky, fa l ling, dried out leaves and wilted plants, the nights are getting longer than daylight as the Sun heads south for the winter.

Just as the seasons of the tropical year are divided under the Sun, so are the prece s sional ages of life divided, under the Sun and by the tropical year, for the cause of the one is also the cause of the other. Since the seven modes of the planets are interdependent, meaning it takes all seven tones to compose each of the seven modalities, so the planetary modes are transposed through the ages, every mode in each of the twelve ages, making eighty - four unique key signatures per great year. E ach age of precession, or each twelfth of Earth ’ s slow gyration against her caelestial sphere, begins with the Sun at the vernal equinox ingressing the last degree of the zodiacal constellation for which that age was named. The present Piscean age, that of tropical ecclesia s- ticy, began at the vernal equinox 220 AD with the Sun 29Pis59. The Aquarian age would theoretically begin 2370 AD were it not for the manifesting corre c tion to the variations. But we ’ ll speak of the tropical year as it has been for some 200,000 years, and the variations affec t- ing us all, the cycles of life and death which tried us in the fire. The ecclesiastical calendar of the tropical year begins at the month of Aries, in which the Sun is exalted. The four cardinal directions refer to t heir exalted planets, East - Sun, West - Saturn, South - Mars and North - Jupiter. As the Sun rises in the East, it ’ s easy to see why the Sun exalts in Aries, with Leo the sustaining major third of the cardinal self Aries. Hence the Sun is happy, joyful, felicitou s, most exalted in sustaining the self of Mars. The spring - to - spring calendar is masculine, the morning - to - morning calendar of the tropical year. Preceding the ecclesiastical Aries - to - Aries calendar, is the feminine Libra - to - Libra, evening - to - evening, lit urgical calendar, as our superconscious awareness precedes self - awareness. Remember, death is the beginning cycle of life, not the end. The second death is the beginning of our i n- carnate life on Earth, the temporal experience of soul and body. Death is sup erconsciousness while life is consciousness. The superconscious is evening. The conscious is morning. The “ conscious ” is self, self as a physical human being. In heaven is soul ’ s “ superco n- scious ” , while life hereon the Earth is mostly mundane - consciousness compared with the u n- filtered, ecstatic vision which is ours in heaven. So that ’ s the better part of life ’ s challenge, to adapt to the co n ditions presented in the body, mind, and soul, then yoke them together in accordance with ones purpose under the exclu sive purview of providence — by free will. Easier said than done, but that ’ s the challenge of life. As the Sun sustains self, the inn u merable stars sustain others. As the Sun is one star among infinite stars, so the self is one among billions of other selves on Earth. Self - actualization is the birthright of posterity or as the saying goes, we see ourselves in our chi l dren, that inherent DNA “ spark ” of self passed on to our offspring. The relationship of self to others is the diffe r- ence of day and night.

Self is personality and others are soul ’ s ind i viduation. The “ inner child ” is the Arian - archetype of self, which is the collective superconscious exe m plar of ideal - self. The golden rule “ love thy neighbor ” is inherent in soul, the ability to step outside of on e- self as the chromatic tone ‘ C ’ of Aries is consonant with the di a tonic ‘ C ’ of Pluto or geocentric observer at the center of the Earth. So the Sun rises and se ts every day, and by the Sun man predominantly lives out his co n- scious days on the Earth. The tropical angle of sunlight to the latitude of human habitation determines generally cyclic weather patterns for that part of the world and the seasons of each yea r, hence what life is like for the people of that latitude, from the perpetually warm torrid zone to the icy arctic or an t arctic regions where human beings seldom set foot. Soul ’ s return to the blue planet that has been rotating some twenty - three degrees i nclined from its once stable and firm rotational axis for about two hundred thousand tropical years (i.e. since tropical years began), human beings and all soul - bodies on the Earth who must e n- dure the tropical variations and its consequential hardships are understandably reluctant to incarnate again & again to live within such an i n herently dangerous environment.

While the Moon is to feel, and the Sun is to see, it is Mercury ’ s to communicate, and to think logically, analy - tically, mathematically. At an average distance of 0.39 AU, Me r cury is the closest planet to the Sun thus has a sidereal year of just 87.9 7 solar days or less than one - quarter of a mean tropical year. As a result Mercury is frequently in retrograde, which usually lasts for about 22 solar days, and occurs within each 115.9 - day synodic interval centered a p- proximately on inferior conjunction. Mercury is visible only near heliacal rising or setting when Mercury is near maximum elongation never exceeding about 28 degrees long i tude. The brief interval when Mer - cury can be seen just aloft the eastern horizon, occurs within a for t- night past inferio r co n junction or between 10 - 17 days past superior conjunction for about a week. Mercury must be a minimum 18 degrees from the Sun to be observable. As the main physical properties and orbital characteristics of Mercury and other planets is co v ered in my “ Tarot Manual ” (available on my website), here we are concerned with the psychological cha r- acteristics of the planets, as a c tualized in thoughts, words and deeds. The psychologically archetypal qualities of the planets and signs are succinctly reflected in the 22 characters of the ancient alphabet ergo the 22 trumps of the major arcana. The temp o- ral manifestations of these archetypes are mirrored in the 12 courts, 40 pips & 4 pages of the minor arcana. Since the four page cards are really just a co m posite o f the three court cards of each triplicity, there are really only 52 cards in the minor arcana. The 22 cards of the major arcana are simply the ten planets and their twelve signs according to their ideal quality. That ’ s why a common deck of playing cards i s sufficient to cast tarot spreads — in the hands of a gifted psychic. Mercury is the consummate astrologer, magician, mathema - tician, wizard, shaman, scie n- tist, alchemist, and witch. Mathematics is the universal language and the universal arch e type of Merc ury, logical, methodical, quick - witted. The mercurial mind is calculating, cunning, shrewd to a fault. By playing the Locrian scale from B - to - B, up and down the white keys of a piano keyboard, you can listen to Kaliope “ singing ” in her fickle theoretical m odality, f a voring no one tone apart from her own. And so Mercury doesn ’ t hesitate to steal from the other Gods, speaking for the other Gods, to belie and deceive the other Gods. But of course the other Gods are not so easily deceived, unless they ’ ve taken a back seat to the analytical mind. While the intellect of Virgo is the po w erful servant of logic and science, Mercury alone is incapable of reason, lacking gnosis, opposing the mystical wisdom of Ne p- tune."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 43 The caelestial lights provide the exaltation of M ercury, the naming, numbering and div i- sions of light, the mathe - matics of astronomy, the intellectual pursuit of enligh - tenment thru study of every subject matter in existence.

This is the feminine aspect of Mercury. Exalted of mind. Innocence of the intellect. Purity of mind is lost to the temporal waning aspect of Mercury, which is the archetypal Lovers of the major ar - cana, the masculine or “ yang ” phase of Mercury receding, the mutabi l- ity of consciousness — on the augmented fifth of Libra — ergo the Gemin i twins, one mortal, and one im mortal as Castor & Po l lux signify communication between mortals and immortals as “ twins ” created in their image. The very division of signs, se asons, days, and years is numbered first by the evening and morning, innocent and guilty, superior and inferior, immortal and mortal. The “ twin ” duality of life, as the Sun and Moon & Stars are twins complementary one of the other. These are the two great luminaries, as the erudite Hebrew - Egyptian priest Moses wrote in Genesis “ which give light upon the earth, and rule over day and over night, and make a separation between the light and the darkness ” . Counting the hours of night then day at the a u tumnal the n vernal equinoxes, then counting the days between them from fall to spring, then from spring to fall. Then counting the days in the year, then over multiples of years, decades & centuries. Then counting the days and years of the sup e rior and in - ferior ph ases of the planets, then the days of heliacal and acronycal phases to fixed stars, then the multiples of the planets ’ sidereal - synodic - tropical periodicities over longer then longer intervals, reaching great years of trop i cal precession, to the seven mult iples of those ending December 21 , 2012. Such is our merc u rial twinship, intellect and communication for the evening and morning. When considering the synodic aspects of the planets, it is the position of the planets to Earth relative to the Sun which dete rmines which sign the planet is making to the Earth, i.e. whether it is waxing superior or waning inferior by its radial velocity. This isn ’ t the same as the apparent phase of the bright limb to the Earth, but is the apparent motion of that planet either t owards or away from Earth at the time. The bright limb of planets a p pears to wax and wane by its relative position to the Sun ’ s light.

Not only did this prove to prehistoric humans and other fairly intelligent hominids that Mercury does in fact orbit the Sun, but also that Mercury is nea r est to the Sun of all the planets, and has a sidereal orbit averaging about 88 days, give or take a few days due to the steep inclination of Mercury ’ s ecliptic, around 7.0 degrees to Earth ’ s ecliptic, and ecce n- tric orbit 0.2056 or over a fifth difference between major and minor axis. As a result, Mercury has for millions of years appeared to Earth - bound observers to ave r age ~85 s ynodic periods every 27 tropical years, making ~191 sidereal orbits of Me r cury every 145 synodic periods and 46 tropical years on average.

But the fundamental principle of astr o nomical observations and counting the days, months and years between observations has r e mained intact, and proves that prehistoric man knew that the planet s orbit the Sun, and that ancient & antediluvian men have known that the planets o r bit the Sun ever since.

By contrast, planets orbitin g the Sun beyond Earth ’ s orbit clearly encompass all of the closer planets, as they visibly circuit the Sun over time to solar opposition or that planet ’ s inf e rior conjunction. The further away each planet ’ s orbit is from the Sun then the longer that plane t ’ s sidereal orbit takes to complete. This is made a p parent to observers watching the night sky over decades and centuries of o b servation and bookkeeping. It ’ s easy to see that Earth ’ s own sidereal orbit with the Sun takes about 365.26 days, as the heliaca l stars attest.

Clearly, ADC ’ s discovery in 2000 is part of these regions. The great mystery isn ’ t mans divine and extremely ancient origins, but is the question: Why do the orthodox science - worshipers tell so many absurd lies about so many things? You see, the whole basis of knowledge and higher learning was predicated on mans ability to learn from his mistakes. That is until lately, since indoctrination has supplanted knowledge and pseudo - academic dogmas have repl aced normal learning processes. Today ’ s secular - religious types would rather roast in hell than admit to centuries of deception. So at once Mercury is malefic aspect in the psyche of men who promote deception, which is the separation or rushing forth of i n tellect which is quickly getting away from the logical mind — fleeing rational thought processes in haste. The High Priestess is pure of thought, high - minded, ready to think things through clearly with logic and efficiency. She is untainted by the distorti ons of disinformation and boldfaced lies of those who ’ ve let quick Mercury get away from them, i.e. those who ’ ve co n veniently abandoned logic in exchange for foolish pride and rapidly fleeting vanity. The benefic aspect of Mercury is like Roddenberry ’ s Sur ak, who was the father of pure Vu l- can logic known as Kolinahr, and the Vulcan priests who, through much discipline, have a t- tained such lucid, logical thought devoid of distortion which the Vulcan equates with emotional aberr a tion — human frailties in other words. But Spock who is half human and half Vulcan fails to achieve Kolinahr, since his emotions are too human, too evolved in his psyche or “ katra ” to be denied equal footing with his tremendous Vulcan intellect. There are fully ten planets in our colle ctive psyche here in our solar system. The divine spheres are universal, as part of the collective soul of the Milky Way galaxy, then the super - collective soul of clusters of galaxies, and so on, to the universal collective soul approaching infinity. Hence , the ten spheres of heaven are universal yet unique to each solar system ’ s d e- velopment from Alpha to Omega as the universal “ I AM ” testifies in the Greek New Testament. The heavenly sphere of Mercury is often called the mental plane or fifth dimension, th e “ binah ” in the tree of life of traditional kabalah (see Chap. 2 Compleat Tarot Manual) which is the divine vessel of Hermes the God of intellect, the second heaven of the “ ten ineffable seph i- roth ” as the Sepher Yetzirah aptly d e scribes it or doesn ’ t desc ribe it, rather the number ten is definite while the sephiroth are d e scribed as having “ ten vast regions bound to them bound - less in origin and having no ending, an abyss of good and of evil...measureless in height and measureless in depth ” . Essentially, this is the tree of life in the midst of the Garden of Eden, “ to eat thereof is to know good and evil ” .

Edgar Cayce proved that mans ps y- chic consciousness of the heavens is corroborated by mans physical & mathematica lly - conceptual observations of the same. The mercurial intellect is mans purely mathe - matical and logical concept of all that he or she surveys. Hence Mercury is the Magus, the mathemat i- cian of the Gods, the one learned in nu m bers, letters, symbols of all kinds, since mathematics is the universal language of the cosmos.

Her pitch key is C above middle C, the perfect octave at the crest of the wave he mould. Venus (Tipharet) has been notoriously confused with the Sun (Hod) by kabalists since about the first century AD. You can find this in any book or website on the subject, where the center of the tree of life shows the Sun, not Venus, in the place of beauty, justice and ba l- ance — all which are definitive qualities of Venus and not the Sun. This sacrilegious obfusc a- tion among sectarian adhere nts has corrupted directly - related studies, particularly in tarot and astrology for those unaware of this confusion. This is important since it draws attention to how Venus intimidates those who fear her tarot trump, the Empress, the great Goddess of eveni ng whom they don ’ t understand. The sheer beauty of a woman in the eyes of a man is the pristine demonstration of Venus ’ power to beautify life beyond compare. Thus the unive r- sally feminine archetype of Venus is the crest or apex of the diatonic orbits of t he planets, “ crow n ing ” the greater - perfect Ionian mode on the high C above the center Mnemosyne — who is mother of the seven diatonic m o dalities then two more repeated modes, adding the bass of Urania, making eight diatonic tones, then Thalia, making nine, t hen Mnemosyne herself who completes the ten spheres that are bound to the ten ineffable sephiroth i.e. the 10 heavens of the universe.

But Gaea , who is mother of all, is mother of nine muses, and is number ten Mnemosyne at her geocenter with Pluto. There is a fundamental difference between the ascending scales and descending scales. An ascending scale rushes forth, while the descending scale retu rns prostrate. Or as W.

Naturally, we earthlings count in earthly terms like hours, days, weeks, months and years. So we number Saturn ’ s sidereal year as about 29.45 tropical years on Earth. One sid e- real year of Venus is a lot faster since she is so much closer to the Sun, taking 0.615 tropical Earth - years to orbit the Sun once full - circle.

Beyond this the sky ’ s the lim it where music ’ s concerned. Universally, music is deemed the highest form of expres - sion in existence, and is the best v e hicle for teaching and learning about astrology and its related scientific and psychic disciplines since m u sic is the basis of the who le universe and everything in it. Name one exce p tion? Of all seven primary diatonic modalities (the planetary muses) none equals Ionian in pla y- ability, listenability and global popularity. The default key signature regard - less of chr o matic pitch is Ionian . A song written in Gb or F# is automatically major unless specified ot h erwise. A song in Gb has 6 flats, and a song in F# has 6 sharps. An ascending scale is notated in sharp notes, while the descending scale favors flatted notes. Same exact tones, but on e is ascending while the other is descending. The sharpened scale tends to be “ running away ” , as a planet begins to recede after inferior conjunction. In today ’ s modal nomenclature, we think of steps and half - steps as moving upward hence the sharpened scal e. By the ancient nome n clature, however, we think of modes as moving down - ward by steps and half - steps, hence the fla t- tened scale tends to be “ returning ” . Rushing forth and returning as the a n cient SePheR YeTzYRH so aptly described planetary motion. That ’ s why the modern - day Ionian is W - W - H - W - W - W moving up the scale and the ancient mode is W - W - W - H - W - W moving down the scale, which is Lydian, not Ionian. The only di f ference between ancient to modern modalities is that ancient modes descend and modern modes a scend. See? Ancient Phrygian dow n wards equals modern Dorian upwards, since ancient Phrygian descends by H - W - W - W - H - W, and the modern Dorian ascends by W - H - W - W - W - H. It ’ s all very sim - ple, really, but its connot a- tion is profound since both ascending and desc ending scales have a d e finitive place in our planetary awareness. As with Venus, her modality is Ionian ascending and Lydian descending. But the rela - tive pos i tion of Venus to the Earth and the Sun reveals its radial motion and"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 58 thereby we know its active ensign. Taurus is Venus “ rushing forth ” , hence ascending Ionian is the mode of Venus receding by radial velocity. Libra is Venus “ r e turning ” , thus descending Lydian is exactly the mode of Venus closing the distance by radial veloci - ty. This means that a s ong written in the key of Taurus must be written in the key of C#. Likewise, any song in the key of Libra must be written in Gb. This is not the same as a planet ’ s sidereal moda l ity but is exclusively the aspect that the planet is making to the Earth & Sun . When the soul of a body leaves its body in the dust and sojourns among the heavens, that soul is moving in real - time with the sphere of its regathering ergo out of the white oblivion of death, out from the f o cus of the iris, in favor of that sphere(s) wh ere the most remedial work is needed in the pa n theion of its development. Diatonic coexistence means that the ten heavenly spheres do live simultan e- ously in our solar system, and more profoundly, all ten spheres coexist throug h out an infinite universe. The order of heaven is always inclusive of every planet in their sidereal o r bital order. We can ’ t say Moon with - out considering the Moon ’ s Aeolian mode as ascending up the scale rushing forth, and also the Moon ’ s Hypodorian mode as descen d ing down returning. As with every planet, the mode of each is made by the six planets of cre a tion plus the seventh planet of rest with only outer planets ’ sidereal modes composed of all seven planets and itself, so Ur a- nus is eighth, Neptune is ninth and Pluto ’ s tenth. Hence, the mode of Venus returns to Venus, third heaven in the sidereal order of our s o lar system. In the pitch key of Libra, Venus rules superior, thus is “ returning ” by flats in the d e- scending - Lydian mode, commencing on F, so the descending Lydian order goes p recisely like this: W W W H W W / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ 7/ \\ 6/ \\ 5/ \\ 4/ \\ 3/ \\ 2/ \\ 1 F Eb Db B Bb Ab Gb Vir Can Tau Pis Aqu Sag Lib Mer Moo Sat Jup Mar Sun Ven R R R R As you see, the above ch art shows that Venus is the des tination of the d e scending Lydian mode beginning on the F, which is the root tone of the ascending Lydian moda l stru c ture.

The music of the spheres is very real.

I n- deed the sojourn of Jesus was the Empress of heaven Venus — conjunct the Emp eror of heaven Jupiter. Her ascending Ionian and descending Lydian are the mode of man ’ s creation. The evening of Venus is her feminine aspect, the evening star who is closing the distance by radial velocity to Earth, by the descending Lydian mode. While L ucifer ’ s is the morning star, receding by radial velocity, running away in the ascending Ionian modality which is the ma s- culine a s pect of Venus, those cast down from heaven to Earth, those born to live and die in sin.

I ’ ve covered this in detail in my Compleat Tarot Manual. Notably, Venus exalts in the aspect of Jupiter - inferior, which is Pisces, which Neptune co - rules. This is Lydian - ascending, and is examined in later chapters on Jupiter and Ne p tune ergo chapters nine and twelve, r e spectively. The popular myth that “ Men are from Mars Women are from Venus ” perta ins to arch e typal qualities of planets, the eternal archetype of the ten planets and twelve ensigns which expli c- itly compose the major arcana of tarot, not the temporal aspects of planets and signs which pertain to the daily horoscope, i.e. of eternal soul and mortal body which explicitly compose the minor arcana of tarot. The archetypes are spiritual ideals, eternal, universal, illimitable. Temporal existence draws upon soul ’ s ideal as it manifests uniquely in our solar system. Similarly, every solar sy s te m in this boundless universe is unique in its own development, with as many life - forms/species unique to its solar system as are unique within our own solar system — provided it has at least one planet which is able to sustain life...not necessarily as we know it. Given the treme n- dous diversity of living organisms that have come and gone on planet Earth over several bi l- lion years of creative - evolution or evolving - creation, which ever construct you find favorable to your sensibilities (those who are creation - only or evolution - only are sure to see error of their ways someday, just not in my life time and probably not in yours) our favo r ite William of Ockham ’ s razor favors an average solar system as having at least some lif e form a ppear over the course of its ex istence, from alpha to omega, swirling primordial “ star stuff ” until its eve n- tual disi n tegration, over billions of years, not Earth years, but as each inhabited planet counts time. Before Venus ’ day, the creation account of Genesis has all earthly existenc e existing and evolving by the evening and morning of Jup i ter ’ s aspect to Earth, the fifth day of creation, whose synodic orbit averages four hundred solar Earth - days, as we ’ ve already learned, i.e. from evening to evening or from morning to morning. Thus evening to mor n ing/morning to evening is half that. Before the sixth day of creation is completed, all life on Earth with every living creature, every beast, every thing from one - celled amoebae to the most sophisticated dolphins, every plant, every thing on land, sea and air, an i mal, vegetable, mineral from the tropic to the poles, all is well under way and has evolved for some billions of years when the pronouncement is made.

Half that from evening to morning or morning to evening, i.e. superior to inferio r, inferior to superior, respec tively. Recall from chap ters one, two and three, herein before, that the minimum of corporeal existence must be at least three - dimensional in order to exist in reality. One or two dimensions are co n cepts only since they have no y - or z - axis, or just no z - axis, respectively. Thus the minimu m for the minor arcana to be applicable takes three or more dimensions, since the major arcana is the archetypal, non - temporal projection of consciou s- ness or mental image of ten planets and twelve signs of eternal universal mind — the s u preme “ I AM ” of the Gods, by whom the elements of creation were created: Fire, Air, Earth and W a- ter. As with Venus, her three major arcana trumps are the Empress, Justice, and Hierophant, which are the archetypes of Venus, Libra and Taurus respe c tively. See? The minor arcana is where the three archetypes of Venus are temporized into this realm of matter, where planets are man i fest in 3 - dimensional existence and beyond with physical laws which govern its creation, sustaining and d e struction, the realm where elemental triplicit ies and qualitative quadr u plicities form the twelve court - yards of heaven of which Venus rules the Court of the King of Swords (seventh house of horoscope), and Queen of Penta cles (se c ond house of horoscope). Venus is always the 3 of Wands, Pentacles, Swor ds or Cups in conjun c- tion with the King, Queen and Knight of that elemental triplicity. It ’ s important to remember what the “ elements ” of tarot and astrology actually are, which is charted as follows: Element Phys i cal Force Quality Suit Fire - Strong Nuclear - Self - Clubs Earth - Gravitation - World - Diamonds Air - Electromagnetic - Consciousness - Spades Water - Weak Nuclear - Unconscious - Hearts Of course the suit of “ Clubs ” is synonymou s with “ Wands ” “ Diamonds ” go with “ Pent a- cles ” , “ Spades ” equals “ Swords ” and “ Hearts ” are also called “ Cups ” .

This is the material basis of Tarot, as explained thoroughly in the initial chapter of Torah. As we open the second chapter the heavens and earth are completed/limited by the se v enth of Saturn ’ s mixolydian modality whi ch is the F or sidereal pitchkey of Jupiter. I.e. Jupiter li m- its Saturn (Kronos, Father Time) on his seventh ascending tone, which is the first hypophr y- gian tone descending or returning to Saturn ’ s pitch key of G. Hence, in the diatonic war of ten sidereal years/orbits, the key of Jupiter limits the moda l ity of Saturn...it ’ s that simple. You can hear this by playing in mixolydian using only white keys of the piano, thus beginning with G ascending or ending with G descending in hyp o phrygian. See how the F - ke y audibly limits the moda l ity of Saturn. That ’ s the basis of myth about Jupiter defeating Saturn, since sidereal is diatonic — all seven white keys of the piano; synodic is chromatic — adding the five black keys. Sidereal are the seven doubles & sy n odic ar e the twelve simples that the planets make via rulership in the iris. Edgar Cayce ’ s psychic insight into mans great antiquity resulted in hundreds of readings on antediluvian events and cultures dated hundreds of thousands to millions of years BC or else i n reference to Ab - Ram (Father - Abraham) or other pivotal persons and events of human prehistory. Oftentimes, Cayce ’ s rea d- ings would indulge the prospect or client to participate in the psychic reading session, be that participation unconscious or otherwise. Sources for information would be tailored to the su b- ject matter, e.g., astrology readings tapped his astrological source. As with the Genesis account of Adam & Eve penned by the old testament sa v iour Ra - Moses, whose God delivered the Hebrew - Egyptian slave s out of bondage in Egyptian lands, Moses repeatedly referred to the first men as the “ red ” race (Heb. Mda, pronounced aw - dawm), and first women as “ living ” (Heb. hwx, khav - vaw). Hence, Autumn & Even are co m- monly used to d e scribe the “ fall ” and the “ night ” re spectively, just as the night of a calendar year begins with the autumnal equinox, when nights grow longer than da y light, and is rightly the evening of the calendar in the fall, in contrast to the morning of the calendar in the spring, when daylight beg ins to exceed the hours of night. Ever since the fall of Autumn & Even, with Earth tilting some 23 degrees on its axis and the instability of the seasons, time has been counted in “ times ” as two times per year, divided first at the fall equinox, then follo wed by the vernal equinox. The book of Daniel uses this nomenclature pristinely to describe Nebucha d- nezzar seven times bit - rabid as a beast in the field, in which the Aramaic Nde (pr o nounced id - dawn) means from equinox to equinox, from fall & winter to spr ing & summer, from spring & summer to fall & winter (two seasons per year). Hence Neb u chadnezzar was crazy for 3 ½ tropical years, not seven as was previously misconstrued by translators. Daniel ’ s “ 2300 ev e- ning - morning ” prophecy (Dan 8:14) was given in yea rs, literally 2300 lun i solar calendar years, with each year subd i vided by evening (fall & winter) to morning (spring & summer). That ’ s no later than 2331 AD, or two grand centuries of Venus after Jesus was crucified at Ca l vary."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 64 Cayce makes it clear that th e first “ Red ” men projected their innate spiritual being into thought forms (364 - 3), and that these forms were defined by the very nature of their su r- roundings, thei r environment, as men did inter act with it to become physically active by the elements of c reation. And in his Dominion over the earth and all life hereon, continued inte r- actions of creator with his creation developed soul ’ s attachment with his body, and its co m- plementary division into the male & female sexes which would eventually distract the creator into carnal pleasures and self - gratification by habitual indulgence, bringing about consciou s- ness of guilt, awareness of the “ Adamic ” fall to make a long story as short as possible. So you see, it is befitting that J e sus souljourned from Venus, giv en that Venus ’ evening - morning of creation is the conception of humankind in the consciousness of the unive r sal Gods which are ten, not eleven, ten, not nine. Perhaps it is mans inherent consciousness of guilt that has kept Venus at a comfortable distance, the venerated sphere of evening - morning and modality of Even & Autumn, of Lydian descending and Ionian ascending, the superior and inf e rior aspects of Venus, that is Libra and Taurus. As an obvious example, consider the code of celibacy in the Roman churc h. Since Caesar Augustus was the emperor at the time John the Baptist and his first cousin Jesus were born (5 months + 1 day apart), celibate males were forbidden to inherit property under Roman law. Apostles of Jesus were mostly married men, and women pri estesses were commonplace, presiding at eucharistic meals in the early days of the church. Even the first pope Peter was married. By the 4th century however, the Nicene Council of 325 AD decreed that an ordained priest mustn ’ t marry, and by 352 AD, the Lao dicean Council decided that women could no longer be ordained. In 385, pope Siricius left his wife and ordered priests stop having sex altogether. And so the church has continued her descent into corru p tion ever since, but against many dissenting voices, a s many priests, bishops and popes have been married, some with children in the centuries after the Second Lateran Council of 1139 during which Pope Innocent II co n- firmed Pope Calistus IIs decree invalidating clerical marriage. It borders on Socratic irony that the top two saints in Catholicism are Mary Mother Of God & the High Priestess Elisabeth Mother of John The Baptist. Both were married, both had chi l- dren, both are topshelf. “ Hail, Mary, full of grace..the Lord is with thee..blessed art thou among wome n and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus - Christ ” etc. Has any mere mortal done better? Regarding a woman in Luke 7:37 - 50 “ And he said Thy sins are forgiven, And he said to the woman Thy faith hath saved thee...peace ” . Jesus had no pro b lem with such wom en.

The harshness of Mars exemplifies the asperated letters, as Ra is hard, and aR is soft. Both “ R ” sounds, but one begins with a letter while the other ends with it, thus softening the impact of the hard “ R ” sound. Each of the seven double - lettered planets demonstrates this quality, as the Moon is Da and aD, Mercury is Ba and aB, Jupiter is Pa and aP, Saturn is Ka and aK, Venus Ta and aT, and the Sun is Ga and aG. Try pronouncing the harsh letters by e x haling, and compare that sound with gentle inhales by saying the letter bac k wards. Exhale “ Ra ” , inhale “ aR ” and so on , to reinforce these “ double - lettered ” planets. The sidereal pitchkey of Mars is E above middle C, thus if you begin on E, play all white keys up and down from there while pronoun c ing aR descending then Ra ascending. Ra is pushing out into the realm of mat ter, while aR is replenishing and revitalizing the spent blood, for each inhale is followed by an e x- hale, breathe in breathe out.

The teaching of division and di s- cord among humans dates back long before the flood — ages before circa 30,000 BC to about 200,000 BC according to Edgar Cayce ’ s readings. This is fundamental to learning astrology, that there ’ s no new thing under the Sun. It has all been done before, and it ’ ll be done again and again in future epochs long after our present age is utterly eradicated & forgotten. King Solomon knew it, as did many wise kings & queens a hundred thousand year s before King David was in diapers. Astrology is as old as the alph a- bet of the major arcana, i.e., twenty - two pronounced letters of the sidereal and synodic sy m- bols of ten planets and their twelve ensigns. Precisely as the letters are common to kabalah, ta rot & astrology, so too is human pronu n- ciation of the letters integral to their power and meaning. Le t ters have power, words have power. The spoken word has far greater power than words silently read, since the 22 letters of words are symbolic of the ten v ast regions of the planets and the twelve tremendous powers they exert to the Earth in harmony with their synodic aspects superior or inferior. R e member that it ’ s the substantial obliquity of Earth ’ s rotation to the Sun which resulted from Autumn & Even ’ s banishment from the Garden of Eden c. 200,000 years ago, and is the cause of Earth ’ s sidereal - daily oscillations in her meridian houses which transliterate into discord, in direct correlation to degrees of fallen - human nature. And so Adam & Eve fell some 2 3 degrees from uprightness. As with the other planets, Mars is absolutely vital for the very existence of this solar sy s tem and all life in it. How then is “ self ” the enemy of mankind? The ego is that Martian co m ponent of self which makes war with the othe r self running away to conquer, pillage and plunder, to strike hard as a ram ’ s horns against formidable prey, gaining the upper hand by the head of Ares, the mind of war, by blood engorged to the gratification of self, as the symbol for Mars portrays the s exual erection of man whose seed is in himself. Recall Mars - Day in Gen 1:9 - 13: “ And God saith, ‘ Let the waters under the heavens be collected unto one place, and let the dry land be seen ’ and it is so. And God calleth to the dry land ‘ Earth ’ , and to the c ollection of the waters He hath called Seas and God seeth that it is good.

The Vulcan priests were consu m- mate astrologers and metaphysicians, so Moses was well - versed in the ancient Egyptian creation myth as is redacted in his now world ’ s most famous Genesis account, the opening scroll of the Torah. Some believe that this ancient account is written in some numerological “ code ” , no doubt because order cannot help but to emerge out of chaos or any seemingly ra n- dom or unconnected vari ations in a system. There are but ten planets and twelve signs, hence the 22 letters of the common ancient alph a bet. It is no mere coincidence that some order or another rises out of any thing that is carefully studied and analyzed. The very action of obse r v- ing a system has direct effect on its outcome however imperceptible or immeasu r able it may be. Thus “ bible codes ” emerge out of those who read the Torah, as much as ou t of the letters and words them selves. Personally I ’ ve not seen one iota of compelling evidence for hidden bible codes, merely unsubstant i ated claims for their presence as unwarranted leaps of faith in combination with ill - founded & misstated conclusions. At least, we know for a fact that the letters symbolize the ten sidereal planets and th e twelve synodic ensigns they make to the Earth from their positions superior or inferior — ergo planets either returning or running away from the Earth by their radial motion and velocity. The sound of each letter and word pronounced by human vocal cords is the true articulatory basis of their sy m bology, i.e., articulated first by word of mouth, thereafter by written form. Since man was created in the image of the Gods, so human speech audibly expresses the la n- guage of the Gods which are the ten planets & their twelve signs. Every part of the human body inside and out, from every hair on your head to the tip of your toenails, from the subatomic building blocks of matter to every living and dead cell throughout your body including the space your body occupie s, the gestalt and sum total of the body is precisely the expression of the Gods who created h u mans from the beginning in our own image as spiritual beings. So how come we don ’ t look like the planets? That ’ s just it, as souls we experience each planetary c onsciousness in that environment or dimension of s u per - consciousness, each soul individually and every soul collectively part of that vast region of experience, as it brings to bear its planetary influence upon the Earth from its dynamic position in space and time. Fu r- thermore, it is a soul ’ s collective experience in each of the heavens beyond the Earth and r e- turning to this tenth heaven which is Earth, it is these collective souljourns which causes psyche ’ s consciousness to exist and to evolve in the first place."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 69 We see Mars at a distance from Earth, but then everyone has also seen Mars up close and personal, as discarnate souls sojourning many times over in the fifth heaven of the solar sy s- tem. Our very souls were born of that cons - ciou s ness of the ten pl anets gestalted together as I AM this solar system and all life in it, all history of it, and all of its destiny composed in the ever - present now. Each soul herein is connected by their experiences here on Earth and sojourning to the nine heavens above Ear th. It ’ s “ being there ” that enables the astr o logical forces of planets and between planets, in this sphere and just ou t side of it. All of our incarnations on Earth combine to the present circumstances of our earthly body, which is rightly called the temple of the Gods, where one God is creator, sustainer, and destroyer of all ten heavens in every solar sy s- tem in every galaxy in every universe. It ’ s all that we mere mortals can do to experience just one God as one planet at a time in the midst of all ten in this one solar system. Hence, the God of this system is the I AM of all ten co n stituent heavens who complete it, unique to our solar system yet part of the universe. When we read the Genesis account of creation, the first six days reflect our God - conscious ness of this creation from the beginning as Gods manifesting in this realm of matter. Collectively we are the Elohiym, not having any begi n ning or end, only the present eternally, to be pre - sent in eternity. That is who we are. Wherever the Gods have been there each and every one of us as “ I AM ” were also, not separate from but rather as part of the whole. Does that make us each a God in our own birthright? Yes according to the test i mony of Jesus - Christ it certainly does! Not as any of us could ever be cer tain but by the grace of God we ’ re i n- structed by the source that we are indeed Gods in our own right: “ I have said, Ye are gods and all of you are children of the most High. ” - Psa 82:6. “ Jesus answered Is it not written...I said Ye are gods? ” (John 10:34). Thus, the words we human beings speak and write are empowered by the Gods for whom the letters of creation have been imbued with divine expressive powers. Thus the reverence we hold for the Gods is conferred on the sacred letters, by which we a r- ticulate th eir divine expression which is audible and comprehe n sible to human hearing. I.e., while one may or may not understand this subject matter, (s)he can still comprehend the la n- guage being spoken, for the most part. Also, as it was nearly thirty thousand years ago, one common la n guage is being spoken across the globe, and that language is of course English. Within the next couple of de c ades, everyone on Earth will have some fluency in English, in addition to their native tongue, since English is fast becoming t he de jure language of money and commerce around the world. As with any pursuit, this comes down to motivation, the necessity of progress — which is the mother of invention. The common usage of English has propelled it to the top of the la n- guage curve by t he motive force of propulsion, i n centive, money, and more importantly the buying power that money gives you. The US Dollar is the most popular unit of exchange."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 70 Even those who don ’ t speak English do know what the word “ dollar ” and “ change ” means, quarter, dime, nickle and penny, all English words, and they can count from one to a hundred in English without breaking a sweat. Words like “ yes ” or “ no ” , “ thank you ” or “ buy ” and “ sell ” , any of the common English words of commerce are in their vocabulary. The Bri tish set out to conquer the world centuries ago. Their colonizing the new world quickly saw the USA rise to power, eventually to become the most powerful nation in recorded history, with many races, cultures and religions being accommodated in the homogene ity of American citizenship, su r- viving and thri ving under the rubric umbrella of our US government and her international military s u periority, accomplished as much by the power of the US Dollar as by military might. Hence the slogan “ IN GOD WE TRUST ” perta ins directly to articulating the letters and words by human vocal cords, to humans seeing these language symbols in print, or on the computer or television screen, anywhere the nu m bers and letters appear to us those symbols are based on the major arcana, w hich itself is rooted in the ten planets and twelve signs of j u- dicial astrology. Even the “ rock ” of ages is ones acknow l edgment to the Messiah by who is the person who pronounces it. It ’ s written in the Bible: “ When Jesus ... asked his disciples, Whom do men say that I ... am? And they said Some say that thou art ... one of the prophets. He saith ...But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed ar t thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not pr e- vail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and wha t- soever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Then charged he his dis - ciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ. ” — Matthew 16:13 - 20 AV You see Peter didn ’ t say to just anyone who Messiah the Prince is but confessed to Me s siah Himself right to his face who He is. The Messiah asked Peter a question, and Peter a n swered Him. That ’ s what was meant by the author of the gospel “ According to Matthew ” . The found a- tion of the ekklesia, the body of Christ, was never intended to be a “ building ” as a church, synagogue or mosque, or an ashram as a community gathering place. But the words on the lips of a hum an being in answer to the Messiah that indeed He is “ Christ ” , which is the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 71 Anointed Son of God. The innate power of the human voice is the rock of ages by our affirm a- tion of who is the Christ in His presence. Such is the power of the spoken word. The lette rs which comprise the alphabet are sy m- bolic instructions of that spoken sound. While the proto - alphabet has evolved into many di f- ferent languages over the millennia, its origin is the spoken word, literally in our human capacity for speech. The fact that w e h u mans can voice the sounds of the alphabet, that ’ s the root of alphabetical symbology or diagrammatics by use of ones human mouth, lips, nose, teeth, throat, and tongue, in order to speak a language and verbally communicate by uttering various associate d sounds like a “ sigh ” of relief. That ’ s what le t ters are, written instructions for how to verbalize ones thoughts and ideas, emotions, feelings, reactions or other human r e- sponses to both internal and external stimuli in life. Even sign language for the d eaf, brail la n- guage for the blind, semaphore, smoke signals, psychic telepathy, all forms of commun i cation rely on the quality of reception and recognition of the type of si g nals thus transmitted. It is said that it ’ s much easier to observe personality tra its in others than it is in ourselves. How one commu nicates with others is not limited to sp o ken or written words of course, but extends to include every aspect of a pe r son ’ s behavior, each nuance of a person ’ s demeanor, every last gram of expression demon strated by that soul in that body — ideally favoring that person ’ s talent for contributing to the betterment of society, and the well - being of others. E i- ther that, or pathological disorders are sure to rear their ugly head as criminal tendencies, i n- sanity with its short - term and long - term consequences, irreversibly detrimental to themselves no doubt but all too often those around them fall victim to their l u nacy. Statistically, however, Mars souljourners are seldom in that category. Even Edgar Cayce questi oned how it could be that his Uranus souljourn was put to good use, as he sought in earnest to help others, but many Uranus souls have turned out to be undesirable characters. Some very much so, like Adolf Hi t ler, Caligula, Al Capone, Castro, Aleister Crow ley, Saddam Hussein, Charles Manson, Robes - pierre, Carl Sagan, Albert Schweitzer, and Ariel Sharon, a l- beit the last entry has his political hands full with the treme n dous karmic, powderkeg tension in the mideast, so let ’ s wish him well and hope Uranus fin ds Temperance in his Aquarian a s- pect. Otherwise, we ’ re all in trouble. Mars souljourners include such notables as Isaac Asimov, Bill Clinton, Robert De Niro, Edie Falco, Sigmund Freud, Vincent van Gogh, JohnPaulII, Carl Jung, Bruce Lee, Tim McVeigh, Friedr ich Nietzsche, Pablo Picasso, E d garAllen Poe, and Immanuel Velikovsky. Clearly, a more desirable clientele is attributable to Mars than it is to Uranian souls — hands down. No wonder, then, that Mars places at the base of the pillar of wisdom, and not the pi l- lar of severity. Rather the Sun, Apollo, enjoys that privilege. The victory of Mars is called “ natsach ” (Strong ’ s 05329 Heb. “ xun ” , pr o nounced naw - tsakh ’ , var. “ netsach ” 05331 Heb. “ xun ” , pronounced neh ’ - tsakh or nay ’ - tsakh), chief, head,"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 72 director, pree minent, enduring, perpetual, always. Think about that. The perpetual ness of self. No matter where *you* go, there *you* are. This is Mars eternally. Essentially, ones understanding of Mars ’ eternalness is vital to his or her self - destruction: destroyer of self, knight of the mutable quadruplicity of court - yards, the changeability, au g- mentation, tendency to instigate epic and permanent changes to the status quo. That ’ s mut a- ble. As the orbit of Venus is e n compassed by Mars ’ orbit, so the ensigns of Venus are adjoined with Mars ’ ensigns in the chromatic zodiac of the superior & i n ferior aspects that the planets make to Earth relative to the Sun. The innate quality of Venus is beauty, corresponding to the tarot trump of Empress in the major arcana, as the word f or beauty in ancient Hebrew is “ t i- pharet ” (08597 hrapt tiph ’ arah tif - aw - raw ’ or trapt tiph ’ ereth tif - eh ’ - reth). Notably, the H e brew word for Justice is ts@daqah (06666 hqdu tsed - aw - kaw ’ or 06663 qdu tsadaq tsaw - dak ’ ), which corresponds to tarot “ Justice ” , and the superior ensign of Libra. Notably the H e- brew word for Scales of justice is “ mo ’ zen ” (03976 Nzam mo - zane ’ or Mynzam, 0239 scales or balances). Venus ’ i n ferior ensign is Taurus, “ desire ” or in Hebrew t@shuwqah (08669 hqwvt tesh - oo - kaw ’ ), lust (05315 vpn nephesh) and other epithets befitting Taurus, our passion for life, for breathing as the living human. This is important to know, because Venus & Mars in myth are closely associated, so in consider a tion of Venus we can see her through the eyes of Mars & hear her through the ears of Mars, and so on. As it is said Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, much as a man sees a beautiful woman through his admiring masculine vantage point. The view is reversed regar d- ing how Mars appears to Venusian eyes, as obse rving the aggressor through eyes of beauty. The great danger of Mars is ego, the receding aspect of Mars which is transliter ated by the letters into terres trial Aries. This transliteration process is the direct interaction of the sid e real & synodic orbits of planets from their positions to the Earth, thus is absolutely a function of the 84 key signatures of the Gods, which is charted in my last book, Compleat Light & Sound, and is published on the following URLs public domain as always: *Min ’ s Key Sign a ture s Of The Gods, includes signs, decans & pentads: http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=SJH6U5U137772.880162037@Gilgamesh - frog.org *Min ’ s Compleat Light & So und: http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=HIDW4JQJ37765.6015509259@Gilgamesh - frog.org *Min ’ s Compleat Tarot Manual: http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=DYR1OZ3237765.6052777778@Gilgamesh - frog.org "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 73 Consider the sequence of the hierarchical order made by the ten planets and their twelve aspects beginning with th e planets ’ sidereal orbits and the ge o centric ensigns they make to Earth. These compose the major arcana, and are archetypal by definition, existing in the mind, but conceptual points in space along the plane of the eclip - tic have no z - axis, and therefore don ’ t exist in the 3D universe, which is thoroughly described in chapters one through three hereinbefore. In this initial instance of the planets & signs, aspects are being continually made by the planets ’ geocentric longitude along zero latitude of the s hort - term mean Earth - Sun plane aka the ecliptic. See how the Sun ’ s position is not only being considered as a point in space but also the i n- finite set of points along the 2D plane of the ecliptic intersects the light reaching Earth ’ s ge o- cent er, from the li ght - corrected di re c tion of each planet. I.e., the planet is slightly in front of the light making the light itself — more at the speed of light — correlated to that light ’ s inte r- section along the ecliptic as seen from the center of the Earth. That is the p recise definition of what the major arcana symbolizes within our solar sy s tem as viewed from Earth, that these aspects are made strictly along the ecliptic, and more importantly, the entire solar system and stars in the caelestial background are referenced to just one point and one point only, i.e. the conceptual geocenter of Earth, whose number is “ 0 ” as Pluto, 10 as the Earth (ref. chapter 13, Pluto, the geocentric “ white pebble ” ).

The triplicity of fire is composed of king, queen and knight of wands ( clubs), and is articulated by Shin or Sigma, the “ s ” sound produced from the center of the closed front teeth, reminiscent of the hissing sound of a snake, thus the letter “ s ” is assoc i- ated with “ tooth ” , and is the last of the three alphabetized “ mothers ” per sepher yetzyrah, which is based on the ancient chaldaic letters of Abraham many thousands of years older."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 74 There are of course the two other alphabetical mothers, Aleph or Alpha, the “ a ” sound assoc i- ated with Arcturus 29 Vir, alpha Bootes a.k.a. “ herdsm an ” , “ oxhead ” or “ ox - driver ” which marks the beginning of caelestial Libra. I should like to point out that Aquarius, as symbolized by water, really refers to the water - bearer, where superconscious energies originate in spirit, hence Aquarius is pouring wa ter as spirit is poured out on the sons and daughters of the most high. The ensign of Aquarius is made by the malefic aspect of Saturn receding and naturally benefic aspect of Ouranos, the caelestial firmament, fixed just as the 1000 & two stars are fixed, and so Aquarius is a fixed sign. Note also, the sidereal consonance with the Moon is Uranus ’ innate Aeolian modality, where the Moon rules Cancer, king or creator of the unco n- scious, “ cups ” or “ hearts ” by suit, and Aquarius is queen or sustainer of consci ousness, “ swords ” or “ spades ” by suit. This is covered thoroughly in my Compleat Tarot Manual, and the clear modal relationship between muses Klio & Urania is made by their shared A e olian modality, though Uranus is adding the bass sidereal pitchkey of ‘ A ’ b e low middle C, making the mode of Uranus the first to exceed the seven sidereal keys of the first seven planets via adding the bass A to Klio ’ s seven - key Aeolian mode. I mention this again, since there have been some a s trologers who don ’ t understand the n ature of triplicities & quadruplicities, who instead have attempted in vain to denigrate such un - derstanding in lieu of intelligence, a p- parently — either that, or they just somehow missed the m u sical rudiments of the universe and everything and everyone in it. I ’ ll ha p pily accept the latter explanation, because the mind is the beginning of wisdom, certainly not the end of it. The last mother - letter is Mem or Mu, ergo the “ m ” sound associated with “ water ” or the “ m ” - like sign of Scorpio, the purified sign of Mars. Remember, the reason we call superior a s- pects of planets “ purified ” , is because they are in sinful aspect during inferior motion i.e. mo v- ing away from the Earth by radial velocity, until they draw close enough by synodic aspect to the Sun as to be lo st, hence “ consumed ” by the Sun, until superior conjunction when that planet is “ born again ” . For Mercury and Venus, these “ purified ” Gods become visible at suff i- cient elon - gation in the evening skies after sunset. While planets beyond Earth ’ s sidereal o r- bit, beginning with Mars, are seen in early morning hours before su n rise. So when you think of Mercury & Venus as purified Gods who died from their sinful nature and were born again, purged by fire, baptised by Apollo as it were, think of them in evening a fter su n set. Likewise, think of Mars, Jupiter & Saturn as superior or born again in the morning before su n rise. Thus, the consciousness of Mars is in the eye of the be - holder. Anything which can be b e- held, there Aries is to do the looking. This is a diffi cult task for some since the Devil is i n deed the Arian archetype, and no one can easily accept that they them - selves are the Devil. Much rather we should blame the Devil for all of our sorrows, and explain to St. Peter at the pearly gates “ the devil made m e do it ” ad nauseam. Essentially, the Devil makes us do it b e cause we ’ re self - serving and self - preserving, the keyword and common denominator being oneself."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 75 After all, we have placed the blame squarely where it belongs, so don ’ t be too harsh on the poor ol d sod. Every planet has at least several popular attributions, Mars as well, but the pri n- cipal quality of Mars is assuredly Ambition. When used in service of others that ’ s a good thing, but self - serving desire is the very essence of that se r pent called the Devil, Satan, the most evil malevolent force in the universe. The moral is Be sure to include others in your plans, and be certain your plans benefit others. Recall from First - Corinthians fi f teen the passage about the sting “ O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory? ” from verses thirty - five through fifty - six especially by e x- act reference to the scorpion/skorpios/ aqrab and victory/nikos/netsach, in English, Greek, and Hebrew, respectively. The astrology of the bible vastly surpasses all oth er theologies bar none, since in astro - logical theology we ’ re fully cognizant that the elohiym in biblical context does in fact refer to the Gods, and that the ten vast r e gions and the twelve powerful signs indeed refer explicitly to the ten pla n ets of ou r solar system and the twelve aspects they make to planet Earth. When the bible is understood in light of astrology, and class i cal mythology, and the ancient not modern kabalah, the entire codex of old and new testament books springs to life and that ’ s wha t judicial astrology is all about.

I really like the way that the Martian “ Phrygian - Up and Dorian - Down ” sounds. There ’ s something plainly military about it, making it easy to envision so l dier s riding or marching into battle, then returning victorious to Rome. This holds true for each planet whose muse is lite r- ally the beginning order or sound quality of that planet, by its sidereal relationship to the other planets. Mars is unique in our solar system, given the 100s of anomalous, appa r ently man - made monuments decorating its surface in mute testimony to a once - thriving civilization that was utterly destroyed by some mad scientists run amuck with only the asteroid belt and Mars (previously a moon ?) or what new - agers claim was once a great planet, remaining. While such a remotely plausible theory is impossible to prove or disprove by orthodox sc i- entific means, notably the fifth sidereal orbit presently occupied by Mars may have been tran s- ferred fro m the once greater planet that Mars simply orbited as its moon. Whatever the case, the present orbit of Mars certainly does number Mars as the fifth heaven in our solar sy s tem, with its z o diac signs Aries and Scorpio being the inferior & superior aspects t hat Mars makes to Earth rel a tive to the Sun. That much is certain. And we know for sure that only the Earth is presently inhabited by humans or human - like b e ings.

In her case, Mars fell in Taurus, but Venus was i n- nate in Gemini while Jupiter was ruling in Pisces, and she was incarnated from the Jupiter souljourn, much preferable to Uranus like Hitler ’ s was. So you see it ’ s the comb ination of all factors in the horoscope that is the root cause of proclivities & inclinations in pe o ple. This is demonstrable in every horoscope I ’ ve calculated and adjudicated in my lifetime, and this totals several hundred documented case histories of fa mous or infamous personalities, plus unknown and anonymous personalities. All you need is the date, time, and place of birth, and the horoscope can then be precisely charted and deduced. Unfortunately, orthodox sec u- lar - religious scientists do not acknowled ge astrological demonstrability, since the orthodoxy rejects all astrological success stories with - out so much as a cursory glance at the evidence. Not as the gentile masses misrepresent but as the ancient star - logicians successfully practiced by virtue of their col - lective knowledge and skills. With only two astrologers on the planet who shared & preserved this enlightenment, namely Michel Nostradamus and Edgar Cayce Jr. since the days of the ancient Parthian magoi, up until March 1998, no one else in t he world had any idea of how to compute much less adjudicate a real astronomical & astrological chart — which withstands even the most critical scrutiny or scientific method. With so few practi c- ing astrologia iudiciarius, no wonder so few have taught & pro moted it. Self - awareness is ben e ficial with Venus in the balance. I like refracting sunlight using prisms & reflecting it using compact discs since the resulting spectrum splays out into a bri l- liant rainbow of colors of i n tensity not easily rivaled. In so doing the gradations of color are perfectly smooth and co n tiguous, as red looks extremely red, and between ultra - brilliant blues and greens, cyan looks extremely cyan analogous to Libra; orange, yellow, indigo, violet, all seven primary colors and their fi ve secondaries between them are tremendously fiery & vivid under the power of direct sunlight, from magenta at the longest visible wavelength just above infrared, down to the shortest visible wavelength just below ultra - violet. The rainbow helps us to see how the planetary aspects & sidereal orbits work together in harmony (I ’ ve analyzed this extensively in my book on Light & Sound, published earlier this year). This is just one of many octaves of the electromagnetic energy spectrum. The sound of music cove rs about ten octaves not just one, reminding us how the astrological forces range from approaching infinity hertz, down to approaching infinitely long wave - lengths, spanning galaxies.

Beyond the five physical senses, man is born with a wide range of psychic senses which trans - cend the p hysical senses a googol of googols times over, but these also work in harmony with our physical senses. But here we ’ re looking at the divine pattern of life on Earth, as the fallen nature of man injects discord into mans e x- periences and also into mans perc eptions thereof. When we think of ancient Egypt, and their reverence for “ Ra ” or “ Re ” the sun god, words like “ ray ” and “ radius ” come to mind, since the root of Re, pronounced ray, not “ ree ” , d e- scribes the circle of the Sun, and its radiant sunlight emanat ing from its sphere or apparent disc out - wards into space.

Similarly, the soft R - sound at the end of morp - hemes can be found across the alphabet. Other languages, like German, French, Italian, Spanish are comparable by common usage of words that begin or end with an R - sound.

Jupiter ’ s mass is barely 1/1000th that of the Sun, since the Sun is close to ten times larger in diameter than Jupiter, while the Sun is only slightly greater in density as compared to Jupiter, so is tugged by Jupiter in its direction, slight ly away from the solar system bar y center which is formed by all of the other planets and their moons, asteroids, comets, galactic mass, etc. (see Chap. 5). If the grav i- tational pull shared between the Earth and the rest of the solar system was the only for ce in astrology then there would be no suit of wands, spades or hearts, only diamonds in the four elements of creation. Certainly, the Earth has its equal place among the elements according to its tri - plicity of Pentacles, which is the court - yard of Riche s, Servants & Society, Queen, Knight and King of Pe n tacles (ref. Compleat Tarot Manual for comprehensive analyses). But the other three elements have their lawful place in the zodiac of mans experience which are the three suits Clubs (Wands), Spades (Sword s) and Hearts (Cups).

The gestalt of these four elements of cre a- tion, sustenance and destruction emerge as and from the Quintessence/fifth astrological el e- ment. So you se e, these orthodox/secular - religious scientists who have buried their pointy little heads down to their necks in the proverbial sand of ignorance and stupidity, not only do they ignore 3/4ths of the zodiac, they also ignore the original basis and synthesis of the elements!

The great regard that the ancients held for Jupiter and his rightful place as Emperor of the heavens shows that the ancients had a much bet ter understan d ing of ancient scripture than their modern - day counterparts. Why? This is a t tributable to the crucifixion of Christ back in 31 AD. This drastic decline in mans understanding of astro - logy seems to have been gradual, radiating outward from ju st north of ancient Jerusalem ’ s gates of Damascus, to the fa r thest reaches of the globe, a process taking cen - turies to replace ancient gnosis with the wholesale cor - ruption, confusion & inju s tice of the age. However, not all was lost until after the old and new testament were codified circa 100 AD, thus preserving the written word of God for po s- terity. This is evidenced by St. Jerome ’ s erudite translation of the Judeo - Xian canon into co m- mon Latin, which work remains the best version of the Bible and apoc ryphal writings available — due in no small part to Jerome ’ s excellent comprehension of occult practices, pa r- ticularly the paramount importance of judicial astro logy to ones ability to understand the Holy Bible.

Consider the ten co m mand ments, and their as trological implications, since these form the rud i ments of Judeo - Xianity, beginning with commandment number one, comparing the Vulgate with my astro - English translation: locutus quoque est Dominus cunctos sermones hos we speak li kewise is God alt o gether the Gods this. ego sum Dominus Deus tuus qui eduxi te myself to be the God Zeus of you who brought up yourself de terra Aegypti de domo servitutis from the land Egyptian, away from the hou se of servitude. Moses begins with two of the greatest names of God, and makes it abundantly clear that the elohiym do speak and are divinely intelligent beyond any human comprehension. The plain translation of the word “ elohiym ” is Gods not God. The mono theistic Go d is singular, whereas the poly theistic Gods are plural. Experts in ancient Hebrew say elohiym meant som e- thing more akin to the ve s sels or “ containers ” of God. The kabalah says the same thing more or less, that these “ ten vast regions ” , the ten planets of our solar system, they ’ re bound to the ten universal, illimitable immeasurably - infinite regions of the cosmos. Hence, the supreme God of the Universe called YaoHu ’ WaH, God Almighty whose name is unspeakable, He ’ s the God of Abraham and God of Mo ses, the God of J e sus who declares “ I AM! ” (the existing one), the God who says that HE IS. The name or attribution of YaoHu ’ WaH (Lat. Jehovah), is the “ I AM ” , and is above all of the other Gods combined. Rather the ten Gods altogether is the habit a tion of God. To the ancient judicial astrologer it was plainly un der stood that the Gods are the ten pla n- ets, and Jehovah is the gestalt or supreme providential energy & creator of this whole s o lar system and in fact the entire Universe. God ’ s law is Universal, he nce the law of this solar sys - tem is exemplary of His law throughout the whole cosmos. non habebis deos alienos coram me not you shall have gods alien in the presence of me. This second commandment shows that Moses was well - awar e of judicial astrology & the teachings of Abraham, which we ’ ve already learned of Moses in chapter 1 (of Genesis). Class i- cal myth & ancient kabalah are unanimous that the Gods number ten not nine, ten not eleven. These distinc - tions are emphatic and abso lutely not open to anybody ’ s interpretation. The ten"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 85 Gods are each the God of one of the ten planets locally in our solar system, and univer sally in the universe and are empowered by the elements of creation. What distinction shall we make between the plan et Jupiter and the God Jupiter? The planet is local to our solar system, and is created in the archetype or image of the universal God Jupiter. To us in this solar sy s tem, our planet Jupiter is precisely our God Jupiter. There are literally hund reds of god s in the various lan guages & religions throughout the ages. But these major Gods of the upper - case “ G ” variety co m plete the essence of Jehovah - God in our solar system of experience. Every time we die and go to heaven, we find our soul up there among the ni ne hea v ens of the Gods beyond the Earth. We can readily know that the habitation of God corresponds to the planet who embodies and empowers that habitation, that vessel, that “ container ” of God. Don ’ t be dismayed. Man is created in the image and lik e- ness o f the Gods as male and f e male. Each of the ten Gods has a male and fe - male quality or divine personality. The individual soul has had experiences in all ten heavens, many times over. Remember, that our discarnate experiences in heaven and our incarnate ex periences on Earth under the rulerships of heaven, this contiguous afterlife/life cycle is what causes the a s- trological influence of each planet to our soul and also to our body, and from that planet ’ s place in the reig n ing hierarchy of Gaea ’ s meridian cou rtyards. So the second commandment admonishes man not to confuse the major Gods with minor ones, since each minor god is b a- sically a subquality or attribution of the major Gods who number ten in all. It seems the alie n- ation of minor gods from major ones is the warning of this commandment. We must recognize that all of creation are the ten Gods universally. Anything that exists and anyone who exists must be attributable to one or more of these major Gods. Next is the so - called “ second commandment ” , which is in fact the third commandme nt, since the first two command ments are explicitly definitive. The first instructs us that Jeh o vah - God and the Elohiym - Gods are of one accord, one voice, one purpose, and are forever spea k- ing as one. The second instructs us not to confuse foreign demigods with anything other than a subset or sub - quality of one or more of the ten major Gods which are the ten planets, with each planet created to suit its quality of Jehovah. non facies tibi sculptile neque omnem not shal l you make of you sculpture nor any kind of similitudinem quae est in caelo desuper et quae similitude to what is in heaven above or which is in terra deorsum nec eorum quae sunt in in the earth below neither anything which exists in aquis sub terra the water under the earth.

I adopt a more pragmatic view, that we mustn ’ t confuse the living with the dead, the animate with the inanimate, that which is divinely created, and that which we ourselves ha ve crea - ted. That doesn ’ t mean we ought not be creative and put our creativity to use, but in the balance we must never allow ourselves to become complacent, and forget who is the God of Abraham, God the Creator.

The most common Latin - to - English translation is LORD, while “ elohiym ” is usually tran s- lated as God. But the judicial/biblical astrologer knows that Jehovah is best translated as God, since the common usage of the word God means God Almighty, or the One True God of Abraham, God the Creator.

In the calendar of Jesus, the evening of the Sun ’ s day not Saturn ’ s day describes the day and ti me of the week that Jesus resur rected — a fact discovered around 5 AM by Mary Ma g dalene. However, in lieu of their astrological understanding of the gospel, to what avail is any of this knowledge? The Sunday “ sabbath ” , or rest from works, to worship God in heart, mind & soul, that is the saving grace of Xianity, so any pseudo - technical or theological argument is not really being helpful to anyone.

That is why Jubilee must always begin on the first day of that 7 th e c- clesiastical month, called Ethanim, which is commensurate with the first of Tishri beginning the first New Year of the fall - to - fall calendar, counting down to the next Jubilee which shall begin on the first day after the next 49 complete years. honor a patrem tuum et matrem tuam honor the father yours and the mother yours ut sis longevus super terram quam in order that to be long life upon the land which Dominus Deus tuus dabit tibi the God Zeus of you will be giving you. Recognizing who Zeus is is crucial to understanding the bible, mythology, astrology, tarot, metaphysics and all other occult studies. Consider who Zeus fathered, which includes the nine muses, who are the most celebrated in all of the pant heion, by the sweet music of the spheres. Consider Zeus ’ place as the king of heaven, emperor and supreme pontiff of the Un i verse. So do not be surprised that Zeus is the highest and most revered God of heaven, the merc i ful and vengeful ruler of the Gods & Goddesses. Sound familiar? Of course it does it ’ s all in the bible. Remember that each of the ten habitations of God is the elemental medium in which God lives in our solar system. Zeus, Jup i ter, is just one of these ten habitations, in the sidereal orbit of Jupiter which enabled its environ - ment to coalesce and develop into the king planet it is today, over billions of years of creative evolution, or evolving creation among the nine other pla n ets in their orbits, which materialized each in its respective orbit by the Universal laws which define both their existence and their destiny, the law of seven by twelve, the “ 84 ” . The natural parents of a child are the male & female of the human race, who are the r e sult of billions of years of solar system creation and evolution, each of whom is a composite of the planets in which his or her soul has s o journed over these same geological aeons. Zeus is the masculine traits of Jupiter, while Hera is the feminine, something like the tomboy of heaven. In contrast, Venus is the habitation of the great queen of heaven, Empress of the Pa n theion whose masculine qualities are like the beautiful and more e f feminate qualities of Adonis. Hera on the other hand is more the protectress, and like her brother and husband Zeus, she ’ s a jealous God, visiting dire consequences on the mo r tal women with whom Jupiter had affairs — the malefic aspect of Jupiter rece d ing and augmenting up the scale in separation from mere mortals incarnate upon the Earth .

Together the gestalt of the ten planets who are so joined, masculine & feminine, the elements combine to complete the hab i tation of I AM (the existing one) in our solar system. The Universe is infinite in all probability. God is everywhere in solar systems across the Milky Way galaxy and in every galaxy throughout the infinite Un i- verse. He is the one God who made it all. He made the ten universal hab i tations that together equals the sum total of universal infinity. In each solar system, however, the hab i tations of God were made locally, and are unique to every solar system more or less. Again, to us Eart h- lings, the Gods are local to our solar system and who they are together is God to us. To respect our parents is to respect the Gods from whom we are all descended, being made in their image as male & female, as every man, woman and child has masculine & fem i nine aspects to their individual & collective souls. It is no wonder that Jesus ’ second great co m- mandment is much like the first, since God to us is like the coll ec - tive of souls and bo d ies that the ten Gods made l o cally in their, rather we should say our own image & likeness. non occides not shall you murder. Biblical verses in the context of Deuteronomy 12:15, or Acts 10:13, which condone ca r- nivorousness or om n ivorous ness, and other biblical verses that condone killing an evil e n emy, such as 1 Samuel 17:49 and Luke 19:27, this is why the Hebrew “ ratsach ” is translated as murder , not kill. Maybe we should translate this as “ thou shalt not kill anyone or anything unrighteously, not yourself nor any other person or sentient being, not animal or plant or mineral shall you kill or destroy without just cause or genuine need in the sight of God ” .

Like Jupiter, Saturn stands out clearly on clear n ights & good seeing conditions, and particularly when Sa t- urn is at i n ferior conjunction or opposition to the Sun. Saturn ’ s mass is less than one - third Jupiter ’ s, so has a lot lower gravitational influence with the Sun. Saturn ’ s orbit is inclined to Earth ’ s ecliptic by about two and a half degrees, and is only slightly more eccen - tric than Jupiter ’ s orbit at 0.054 & 0.048 respectively. As the least dense planet in our solar system, combined with Saturn ’ s speedy rotation of less than eleven hours per 360 - deg ree day, Saturn is the most oblate sphere of all albeit Jupiter rotates a little faster at under ten hours per Jovian day. Saturn is the golden planet, with his soft atmospheric bands having golden - yellowish hues (see Min ’ s Compleat Tarot Manual for more c omprehensive d e- tails on the planets & signs, such as Saturn ’ s rings). Saturn is made out of the ascending Mixolydian sidereal mode beginning on the pitchkey of ‘ G ’ and ending on ‘ F ’ whose is the sidereal key of Jupiter — hence the classic mythology that Ju piter defeated Saturn: by limiting his otherwise major modality on the flattened se v- enth. Play Saturn ’ s mode beginning on the G and ascending on white keys only. Notice the distin c tively limiting value that Jupiter ’ s ‘ F ’ exerts over the Mixolydian mode. He ar it? Saturn ’ s a s cending mode is W - W - H - W - W - H, and H - W - W - H - W - W descending is Hypophrygian/ Locrian. The best rule to re member is that ascending steps begin on the tonic funda ment al tone of that modality, while descending steps must return to that same toni c key, playing only seven tones per scale. Eight - tone scales begin and end on the tonic key either an octave above or else an octave below that fu n damental tone, different octave, but repeating tones. Saturn ’ s archetype is Judgment of the major arcana, who is Kronos in the Greek, hence the Scythe or father time. The double - ensigns of Saturn are Capricorn and Aquarius, the arch e- typal World and Temperance of the major a r cana, respectively. Saturn is at the center of the “ pillar of severity ” in the tree of lif e. The superior, descending, benefic letter of Saturn retur n- ing is pr o nounced as the softened “ aK ” sound, symbolized with the Caper (he - goat) ergo the ensign Capricorn, i.e. Saturn ’ s benefic aspect returning “ born - again ” by radial velocity. The harsh by le tters of Saturn is the “ Ka ” sound, Kappa in the Greek. Kut, Kill, Kap, Karve, K a- dosh, Kaiser, Kal, Karat, Kami kaze, Karate, Karma, Kasbah, etc. The Saturnine thinker is co n- templative, introspe c tive, reflective, the limits of time, the modal muse of hymnody , praise, worship, or anything related to the sabbath, restful, tranquil, and constrained by limits, s e- rene, disciplined, bringing an end to circu m stances, extreme changes & new experiences, climbing the “ ladder ” of Uranus to reach new beginnings (see next chapter). The harsh, m a-"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 98 lefic aspect of Saturn limits these changes, consciousness of regret, guilt or nostalgia, wistfu l- ness of a lonely soul trapped in time. Saturnine souls tend to be dissatisfied or disappointed, continually seeking to change things fo r the better, as can be a very powerful force for good, but can distract Saturn ’ s atte n- tion too often — a jack of all trades, but ma s ter of none. Capricorn is adjoined to Aquarius, thus the soft/harsh sound of ‘ K ’ are most nearly the same of the double - let tered planets. The ending of “ aK ” is very abrupt, su d den, and with a hard cutting edge, as spoken. Hence, replacing the “ C ” and “ Q ” with the “ K ” , then the names “ Kapricorn ” and “ aKua r ius ” reveal the m selves, but their order seems strangely reversed. That is , until we remember that Saturn ’ s inferior sign is also Uranus ’ su - perior sign, and that the sound of “ Ka ” / ” aK ” are nearly equal when spoken. Also n o tice how the name “ Pisces ” be - gins with the “ Pi ” of Jupiter - inferior/Neptune - superior, and Taurus begins with Venus ’ “ Tau ” . Other signs reveal their sound imbedded within the name, like “ Ares ” which is pronounced “ ah - rays ” , emphasizing the “ Re ” sound for Mars - inferior, and Skorpios with its “ oR ” sound of Mars - sup e rior and Pluto - inferior (see chapter 13). Libr a, of course, is named for the balance and the “ book of life ” , which weighs our works o f good and of evil since caeles tial Libra with Arcturus & Spica close to the beginning is the archetype of the ankh, which is the symbol of Ve nus — the fu l- crum at the ce nter of the tree of life, and who holds both dishes of the balance in Ta u rus & Pisces of the terrestrial courtyards more ruled by the planets Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, & Saturn last of all, i.e. all of the planets who have double - ensigns an d so are more e f fective in adjudicating the horoscope.

Furthermore, each planetary modality is being transposed into a specific chromatic key, and our simpl e pronu n- ciation of each chart becomes very musical. Virgo is always the “ F ” tone, such that the mode of any planet therein is being transposed into that key. Hence Mercury, whose mode is Locrian ascending and Mixolydian descen d ing, begins on the “ E ” then d escends seven steps to the tonic “ F ” . At least, each of the three syll a- bles of this chart ’ s “ eb - out - ip ” should be pronounced in key, hence the triad “ F - Gb - Ab ” .

Saturn ’ s exaltation is for the sup e- rior aspect of Venus, Libra, which is cardinal west — as the Titans count time in the first house of ev e ning, as call ed the west - above. Saturn ’ s common association with the “ devil ” is because of Mars ’ exaltation in the tenth house, that of the “ he - goat ” Capricorn, whose terrestrial court is the King of Diamonds, mea n- ing creative quality of the earth - element.

In essence, every soul tends to grow quick ly a c- customed to its lifestyle, whether incarnated upon the Earth, or sojourning about in the hea v- ens above Earth, or waiting for the judgment between heaven and earth, either below the earth. Remember that the judicial astrologer counts the beginning of l ife at the moment of death, beginning with soul ’ s departure for the heavens. The e x ception to this is called heaven - in - practice, heaven - on - earth, the tenth heaven where humans don ’ t all die but are changed in the proverbial twinkling of an eye, as in one m oment. The continual struggle between souls wanting to stay in heaven verses souls wanting to stay on earth, and souls wanting to leave heaven and return to earth against the souls who want to leave earth and return to heaven, the the ba t tle for evermore i s fought on the aetheric field, where begins evening & morning, the reasons of activity. Consider this profound juxtaposition, since souls don ’ t want to leave their familiar hab i tat, except if they ’ re roasting in Hades, in which case they ’ re dying to leave . Also, there are souls who ’ ve had quite enough of mortal tr i als and tribulations, and so they ’ re dying to return to the relative bliss of heaven. The divine conflict is best described as death to oneself, d e struction of self. Why, you might ask? Because D eath, the Scorpion of Mars - superior, is ante - Aries, lite r- ally “ before the self ” of the inferior aspect of Mars receding by radial velocity. That ’ s why alpha Scorpio was dubbed Antares, ante - Aries. The astrological distribution of the twelve tribes, one tr ibe for each sign, makes one sign per tribesman, with each tribe having a thousand tribesmen in each sign.

Hence each day is for each soul/god - incarnate, literally, a desce n dant of the Gods. 144,000 days (dies) is to 144,000 gods (deis) - incarnate.

There are the three repeat modes, Aeolian, Locrian and Ionian for Ouranos, Poseidon & Pluton - Hades, respe c tively, with 8, 9 & 10 tones each i n their scales. There have been numerous attempts over the centuries to deduce the corresponding z o diac sign for each tribe and their guardian angels, birthstones and astrological sym - bology thereof. Generally, the color of the birthstones roughly corresp ond to the zodiacal rainbow, e.g. Ta u- rus is red - orange, Virgo is green, Capricorn is i n digo, and Pisces is violet or magenta. Libra ’ s green - blue or cyan, Leo ’ s ye l low & Cancer is orange - yellow, Scorpio is blue, Sagittarius is blue - indigo, Aquarius indigo - v iolet, and Gemini is orange.

Sun in Aries, Saturn in Libra, Mars in Capricorn, and Jupiter in Cancer. The compass directions be ing east, west, south & north, res - pectively. Hence, the Sun might be associated with ruby, the color of Aries, or onyx the color of Leo. Since the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter & Saturn make two signs apiece in the zodiac by their superior & infe rior a s pects to the Earth relative to the Sun, it makes more sense that the house of exaltation for each planet goes with that color of birthstone, since that is a planet ’ s most logical favorite color. The Sun prefers red, blood - stone or ruby, or perhaps any other reddish, or pinkish stone like rhod o chrosite would do just as well. You see, it ’ s the planet of ones sojourn which prefers the color of its exaltation. E.g., the Mars sojourner prefers the color of itself, red, and its color of exaltation which i s i n- digo, or any deep - blue stone, such as the sapphire.

You ’ ll find no one has a clue what you ’ re talking about, since they were misled into believing “ tropic - illogical ” cha r latans who can only pretend to be astrologers since they never learned about biblical o r judicial astrology. As for the twelve tribes [Gen 49:1 - 28, ibid], generally zodiacal descriptions are accorded most of Jacob ’ s sons, as the sons & daughters of Israel. The trad i- tional sign for each of the twelve houses are fairly obvious, or so it seems. First, the order of birth is r e corded, as are the names for each of the four directions called “ camps ” which is composed of three tribes each. To the east, to the rising Sun, is Aries with the exaltation of the Sun. Remember, Leo is the zodiacal force tha t the Sun exerts on the Earth. Strength is the Sun ’ s, not some arbitrary sign or group of stars up in the sky, but the Sun. See? The lion is the standard of Judah ergo Judah is the Sun, because the exaltation of the Sun is rising in the east. To the south is the camp of Reuben, with the exaltation of Mars in Capricorn. In the ce n ter is Pluto - superior & Mother Earth with the tabernacle in the camp of Levites. To the west is Libra and the exaltation of Saturn, camp of Ephraim. To the north is Cancer, with the exalt a- tion of Jupiter, which is the camp of Dan. The four elements are each composed of their el e- mental triplicities, with Creator, Sustainer, Destroyer, the King, Queen & Knight, Card i nal, Fixed & Mutable, respectively.

This has long been a sticking point to the orthodox theologians, since they ’ ve never studied bibli - cal astrology, nor have they practiced it. When we look at the list in the context of tri bal “ mothers ” , we then see the correlation with the kaba l lah and classic Greco - Roman mythology. The Olympians are the children of Rhea & Kronos. The Hebrew word ephraim literally means “ very fruitful ” , and Kronus & Rhea were indeed that. When you consider that Rhea ’ s the feminine nature of father time, both “ sister ” and “ wife ” of Saturn and his attributions, you begin to understand the g e- nealogical theocracy that is portrayed in classical mythology. Judah, the Sun, is Apollon - Re, son of Zeus & Leto. His tw in sister Artemis, the Moon, is the only other planet that appears to be a - bout the same size as viewed from Earth, and is further - more the only other planet that is orbiting relative to Earth sidereally, hence, the myth that they are “ twins ” . It ’ s the u niqueness of the Sun & Moon to Earth which is cause for them ruling only one zodiac sign apiece, even though there are seven double letters in the astrologic alphabet. Five of the seven doubles are Mercury & Venus, Mars, Jupiter & Saturn, each of which for m two zodiacal aspects, the hard and the soft, which again are B, T, R, P & K, leaving D and G for Cancer and Leo, r e spectively. This is fundamental to understanding the genesis of the twelve tribes, the twelve chromatic aspects of the Gods to the Earth, w here the Sun & Moon are awarded only one sign each since both planets orbit the Earth sidereally, so that their double - letters, D & G, are made by phases of the Moon to Earth, and night and day made by the Sun to the rota t ing Earth — neither of which are sig nificant vectors in radial velocity, hence they get but one sign apiece. So we see, the ten planets always make 12 signs, and these signs are numbered 1 through 12 in the zodiac beginning with Aries and ending on Pisces, respectively. At this point, let ’ s review the basic genea l ogy of Gods in the Greco - Roman pantheion, using classic Greek names:"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 104 Ouranos (Father Heaven) & Gaea (Mother Earth) / | / The Three Furies, | / Erinyes/Eumenides: | / Alecto (Relentl ess) | / Megaera (Begrudging) | / Tisiphone (Avenging) | /  | / / | / The Three Fates, |/ The Moira/Moirae | Clotho (Weaves) | Lachesis (Measures) | Atropos (Cuts Off) |  |  | { ------- Kronos & Rhea (Time) | \\ / | Zeus & Hera (Sky) | | \\ / Hades (Underworld) | \\ Poseidon (Seas) | \\ Hestia (Hearth) Z \\ Demeter (Fertile) E \\  U \\  S Ares (War)  | Hebe (Youth)  | Hephaestus (Fire)  | \\ Eileithyia/Eris (Travail)  | \\  | \\  | \\  | \\  | \\  | & Leto (Fruitful): /| \\  / | Apollo (Sun) / | \\ Artemis (Moon) / | \\ / | \\ / | \\ & Maia: | \\ / /| \\ Hermes / | & Eurynome: (Messenger) / | \\ / | The Three Graces: / | Aglaia (Splendor) / | Thalia (Good Cheer) / | Euphrosyne (Mirth) & Dion: | / | Aphrodite | (Beauty) |  |  | ad infinitum..."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 105 In the war of ten sidereal years, the chromatic ensigns form twelve directional titans to twelve transliterated signs of the horosco pe, and is the battle of Armageddon between souls cast down to Earth and souls departing to the heavens above. Here they are, in alphabetical order: Titans Olympians ------ --------- Atlas Ap hrodite Koeus Apollon Kronus Ares Epimetheus Artemis Hyperion Athena Iapetus Hades Metis Hephaestus Oceanus Hera Phoebe Hermes Prometheus Hestia  Rhea Poseidon Tethys Zeus Clearly, ten of these twelve signs correspond to double - lettered planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter & Saturn, whil e the remaining two of them match with the Moon and Sun as Cancer & Leo. The vast regions are the Titans in their sidereal and synodic orbits. The Oly m- pians are by astrological transp o sition reigning in the horoscope of Earth, and each soul who sojourns on the Earth. This is done by election, not foisted upon us by the directions. The accession, or succes sion myth of the Olympians over throwing the Titans is som e times inconsistent comparing extant sources such as Hesiod ’ s Theogony, Homer ’ s Iliad, or Apoll o- ni us ’ Argonautica. But the consensus that Zeus reigns supreme with our fellow Oly m pian Gods atop Mount Olympus is uncontested. The Titan Gods were defeated in the ten sid e real - years war, i.e. of each planet or vast region known as the Titans yielding to the music of the spheres transliterating the greatest & predominant rule of the Olympian Gods from their pos i- tions to Earth. The meridian houses or courtyards of the Gods as they trans - pose under the planets closer to the Earth: Venus, Mars, Mercury, Sun, Moo n, Jupiter & sometimes Sa t urn, this is the practice of judicial a s trology. For what purpose we ask? It is the understanding of our soul ’ s rel a tionship, each with its earthly ha bitation of the living human bo dy, it is no less than the conscious elucidation of the principal phases of life & death and soul ’ s sojourns in heaven & earth that every sovereign astrologue adjudges. Why do the secular orthodoxy have such difficulty under - standing what biblical astrology is — or what purpose it serves? You would thin k that everyone with a soul would be interested to learn how and why souls s o- journ in the heavens then incarnate to this earthly body, each of us at our a p pointed time, once to die, then the adjudgment. And so it goes to the ages of ages for every soul ali ve."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 106 The relationship of the Titans with the Olympians shows the contrast between planetary motions and hierarchical reigns in the horoscope. Some of the T i tans are readily associated with their corresponding Olympian, e.g. Hype - rion & Apollon for natural & judicial Leo, respectively; Phoebe & Artemis for natural & judicial Cancer; Oceanus & Poseidon for nat u ral & judicial Pisces, etc. There is the Titan Kreios, God of the four winds, who must yield to Zeus, whose authority overrides the directions, with th e adjudgment of reigns exerted by the Gods upon Earth. And because of our many sojourns there over millions of light - years, we bring that aggregate experience to this, our pr o verbial table of mortal life till the day we die, each of us playing the horoscop ic cards that we ’ re delt. That ’ s why the horoscope is at the first breath of life, whereas the soul has within that day to incarnate again to its newborn habit a- tion. You are part of the Titans & Olymp i ans, invariably at war with the soul and oversoul: one of corrupt nature, approaching inferior conjunction, and the other purified in duel with the Sun to superior conjun c tion, when oversoul is born - again in the heavens. Oversoul is the individual will at one with the will of God. Like Jesus said “ among them t hat are born of women no greater than John the Baptist is risen...yet he that is least in heaven is greater than he..from the days of John till now the heavens suffer violence...the violent take it by force ” [Mat 11:11 - 12]. Some food for thought. Now, of t he twelve tribes of Israel, we ’ ve already iden tified four of them with absolute ce r- tainty. 1) Judah ’ s the Sun whose sign is Leo; 2) Reuben is Mars whose sign is Aries & Sco r pio; 3) Ephraim is Saturn, whose sign is Ca p ricorn & Aquarius, and 4) Dan is Jupite r, whose sign is Sagittarius & Pisces. According to the four cardinal directions these four planets exalt in Aries, Capricorn, Libra & Cancer, East, South, West & North, respectively: CAMP SIGN TRIBE EXALTS ENSIGN MOTHER ---- ---- ----- ------ ------ ------ East Aries Judah Sun Leo Leah  Issachar Leah  Zebulun Leah South Capricorn Reuben Mars Ari & Sco Leah  Simeon  Leah  Gad  Zilpah Center Iris Levi Jehovah All Signs Leah West Libra Ephraim Saturn Cap & Aqu Asenath  Manasseh Asenath  Benjamin Rachel North Cancer Dan Jupiter Sag & Pis Bilhah  Asher Zilpah  Naphtali Bilhah "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 107 There ’ s a tendency to ascribe qualities as described by our father Jacob to the planet for which each child was associated, but this is not necessarily the case. Birth horoscopes of the father, mother and their children may as likely — probably more likely — be the reference b e ing used, since it ’ s predicated by Jacob saying, “ I declare to you what will happen in the latter end of your days ” . That ’ s clearly the fruition of the natal horoscope, and not anything else could that possibly be. Reuben for ex ample, is d escribed like the Sun, yet his tribe matches explicitly with Mars in Capricorn. It could be Reuben ’ s natal Sun or part of Fortune is in terrestrial Leo, for example, and Jacob was interpreting this aspect. Reuben was a Mars sou l journer, that much we can be sure of, as his tribe heads up that camp to the south. Again, it is the mood of the passage which defines its portent since this is given in the imperfect mood, meaning “ temporal ” , for that person specifically, by the Qal stem (Heb. arq , “ qara ” pr o nounced kaw - raw, meaning to befall) Reuben as his firstborn son. His natal Mars in Leo would work too. The point being, we ’ re talking about horoscopes and not the simple order of birth. The real key to solving this long - standing astrological conundrum is revealed in the mothers of these children, with the implied correlation based on the classic creation myth which varied more by language than by actual planet and sign of the major ar - cana as we e x- perience them in our own solar system. The first mother Leah has f ive of the twelve tribes and the Levitical priesthood. Then Leah ’ s handmaiden Zilpah has Gad and Asher, two of the tribes. Rachel has Joseph and Benjamin, whilst handmaiden Bilhah has Dan and Naphtali. R a- chel ’ s grandchildren through Joseph with Asenath, th e daughter of an Egyptian priest, is M a- nasseh and Ephraim; the tribe of Joseph splits into these latter two tribes. Nine of these twelve tribes must be attributed to three mothers Alpha, Mu & Sigma, as charted above. With Sigma the mother of Sagittarius, L eo & Aries. Alpha for Libra, Aquarius & Gemini. Mu for Scorpio, Pisces & Cancer. The remaining three signs are for the Earth - mother which is Virgo, Capr i corn & Taurus. Twelve signs w/ four mothers. In the Greek creation myth, there are at least four pri - m ary mothers, begi n ning with Gaea, Mother Earth, who is the great great grandmother of all creation. Her powers manifest uniquely in every solar system in the universe, just as do the other nine planetary Gods. Kronos & Rhea are born of Gaea & Ouranos. Zeus & Hera are born of the aforesaid, as are Hades, Poseidon, Hestia, then Dem e ter. Zeus in turn fathers progeny with Hera, namely Ares and Hebe, Hephaestus, & Eileithyia. Zeus fathers myriads of other children, Apollo & Artemis with mother Leto, then Hermes with the beautiful Pleiadian Maia, and Aphrodite with mother Dion (others say Mother Earth via castrated parts of Ouranos). In the case of Asenath, most say the mother is as much grandmother Rachel, since the mood of the Qal stem is perfect (Genesis 41:50, 46:20, Heb. dly , yalad, meaning to bear). Not once but twice, clearly em - phasizing Rachel ’ s offspring as to foreordained purpose."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 108 We ’ ll examine both possibilities concerning Asenath and her mother - in - law, since either or both may satisfy our common crite ria. The perfect mood tells us this is more of a long - term prophecy than just a genealogical report. Gen e sis 29:17 says “ Leah was tender eyed but Rachel was beautiful ” . What Leah says in Gen 30:11, the part about “ the troop ” is perfect mood while the part about Gad is imperfect mood. See the difference? The tribe of Gad is foreo r dained, Gad himself is temporal, as to the moment. Gad is the actual son of Zilpah & not just a d e- scendant. Not to belabor this point, but it ’ s imperative that you understand this p articular aspect of the ancient Hebrew language. Not as an expert, but about the difference of imperfect mood verses the perfect mood. One “ speaks ” to the moment, while the other is a lot closer to prop h- ecy. The old aphorism about one day is like a thousan d years just as a thousand years is like a day to Jehovah, this originates in the understanding between the perfect and the i m perfect mood of Hebrew writing, reading and under - standing. The day is imperfect, & 1000 years is perfect. But wait! The day is p erfect as 1000 years is imperfect. It ’ s like reading, then reversing, that famous “ for the want of a nail, the shoe was lost ’“ ; shoe..horse; horse .rider; rider..battle; battle..kingdom and all for the want of a nail ” . The ma c- rocosm & microcosm tend to giv e each other a whole lot to ponder and to be aware of, as holds true for the ancient Hebrew language. It ’ s like a biofeedback mechanism, really, here focused on learning. Because the alphabetical mothers are arranged in groups of four elemental triplicitie s, then their children are subject to the same elements as their mothers. The five double - ensign pla n- ets rule two el e ments apiece, such as Mercury rules Gemini & Virgo, Knight of Air & Knight of Earth. Venus rules Taurus & Libra, Queen of Earth, King of Ai r. Mars rules Aries & Sco r- pio, King of Fire, Queen of Water. Jupiter rules Sagittarius & Pisces, Knight of Fire & Knight of Water. Saturn owns Capricorn, Aqua r ius, King of Earth, Queen of Air. The Sun rules Leo Queen of Fire. The Moon rules Cancer King of Water. Notably, the masculine & feminine a t- tributions of the courtyards com - pl e ment the signs of these houses. The Moon, explicitly feminine, rules over the court of the King of Cups. The Sun, masculine, rules the court of Queen of Wands. Simi - larly, the double - ensign planets rule by radial aspects over their r e- spective co urtyards in the same, complemen tary fashion. The feminine aspect of V e nus is the court of the King of Swords, L i bra, while Taurus, or Queen of Pentacles, is Venus ’ masculine aspect. The unstable, or mutable, courts are ruled by the masculine and feminine aspects of the planet, one for each sign. To wit, Virgo is the feminine aspect of Mercury & Gemini is masculine. The masculine aspect of Jupiter rules Sagittarius, thus the feminine a s pec t rules over Pisces, albeit these dis - tinctions are less obvious than the others. Then we see Mars — extremely masculine — ruling over the court of the King of Wands, Aries. Scorpio, Queen of Cups is perhaps a slightly more feminine aspect of Mars, but tha t ’ s not as obvious at first"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 109 glance. Saturn in Capricorn is male very obviously, as signified by the caper, or “ he - goat ” , the court of the King of Pentacles. Aquarius, the Queen of Swords, is clearly the feminine aspect of Saturn. As we compare these zodi a c al results with Jacob ’ s children and their mothers, several observations may be apparent. This list of children represents the ten Gods and their twelve Ensigns. This grouping of children is consistent with the four elements: Aries = Fire; Capr i- corn = Eart h; Libra = Air; Cancer = Water. Leah has the most children, numbering six in all. Zilpah has two and Rachel has one. Bilhah has two and Asenath has two, for thirteen in all. Levi, of course, represents Pluto & Earth - Mother, which is the center of the eye o f the Sky & the Fool of Tarot, the four Pages together, the twelve Courtyards together. Judah repr e sents Aries, Reuben is Capricorn, Ephraim is Libra, and Dan is Cancer. So far we ’ ve represented five of the ten Gods and four of their twelve ensigns and we have done so strictly by astr o logical scientific method.

So far we ’ ve represented five of the ten Gods and four of their twelve ensigns and we have done so strictly by astr o log ical scientific method. When we include the father figure of the Gods and their Ensigns going in order around the zodiac, Zeus and Hera begat their son Ares who rules Aries. Zeus & Dion begat their daughter Aphrodite, who rules Taurus. Zeus & Maia begat th eir son Hermes who rules Ge m ini. Zeus & Leto be - gat their son Apollo & his twin sister Artemis, the Sun who rules Leo, and the Moon who rules Cancer. Next, the son of Zeus & Maia, Hermes, rules Virgo. Zeus ’ & Dion ’ s daug h- ter Venus rules Libra. The son of Zeus & Hera Ares rules Scorpio. Zeus, the son of Kronos & Rhea, rules in Sagitt a rius. Kronos, son of Ouranos and Gaea, rules Cap - ricorn. Kronos, and his father Ouranos rule in Aquarius. Finally, Zeus and his brother Poseidon rule over Pisces. So, accordin g to the majority consensus of classic myth, Mother Earth is mother to her caelestial sphere Ouranos. Thus, Earth & Heaven are the parents of Kronos and Leah, or F a- ther & Mother Time. This makes Mother Earth mother to two of the ten great Gods, namely Oura nos and Kronos. Note the caelestial firmament is like a brother to Gaea, whereas the planet Ouranos is locally the eighth sphere, and more like a son to Mother Earth in our solar system, i.e. within the limited space of planets out to Neptune and Pluto wel l within the Ku i- per belt & vast Oort cloud. Bottom line Gaea is mother of two of the ten great Gods, Kronos and Ouranos, the seventh and eighth vast regions of heaven in our solar system. Saturn ’ s feminine aspect Rhea is the mother to three more of the gre at Gods, who are Poseidon, Hades"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 110 and Zeus, a.k.a. the three brothers, for a total of five of the ten great Gods, leaving only five more to go. Hera is mother by Zeus to Ares, one of the r e maining five Gods. Four to go. By Zeus Leto gives birth to Apollo & Art e mis, the twins, leaving two to go. By Zeus Maia has Hermes, and by Zeus Dion has Aphrodite. The many facets of Jupiter ’ s feminine nature are mother to his children, and particularly the five younger Gods called the Olympians with Zeus as our Emperor of Heaven. Leah is the only mother with enough children to satisfy the Olympian Gods fathered by Zeus. Like Achi l- les, hero of Homer ’ s Iliad killed by Paris with an arrow, sagitta, in his only vulnerable spot, his heel, Jacob represents Zeus who supplants the reign of Kronos in the pantheion. Even the name Jacob (Heb. bqey pronounced “ yah - ak - obe ” ) means “ heel holder ” or “ su p- planter ” , from the primitive root Heb. bqe, “ aw - kab ” , meaning “ to supplant ” or “ take by or attack at the heel ” , “ assail insidiously ” etc. as the Hebrew Lexicon indicates beginning at Gen e- sis 25:26 (freeware on http://www.onlinebible.net/downloads.html ). The war of ten sid e real years is much the same as myths and enmity surrounding Jacob and Esau, and their d e scen - dants. Israel is already vi ctorious in the perfect mood of prophecy since Jesus was crucified at Golgotha 31 AD. But here in the 21st century AD, many still hold hatred one for the other, this ancient and portentous vendetta. Let ’ s say Leah is the generic name for Zeus ’ many wives a nd lovers, really just the overall feminine attributes of Jupiter, who we commonly associate with Hera or Juno. Leah means weary — no doubt from having so many chi l dren! The biblical names of her sons are Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. Just their names may show some rel a tionship to how they are grouped by threes, as Judah means “ praised ” , Issachar means “ reco m pense or re - ward ” , Zebulun means “ exalted habitation ” . Next, Reuben means “ behold a son ” , Simeon means “ be heard ” or “ rock ” . The n appears Gad whose name means “ troop ” , Zilpah ’ s son. Clearly, Zilpah, whose name means “ trickling ” , is close - ly attached to Leah as her han d- maiden. That ’ s six signs so far. Centered in the twelve signs is Levi whose name appropriately means “ joined toget her ” , the whole zodiac. Before continuing, assuming that Leah ’ s children corres - pond to the Olympic progeny of Zeus, these children are Ares, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes and Ap h rodite. We ’ ve seen that Judah must be the Sun in Aries. The sceptre is the wand, s taff, or rod of power, as in Genesis 49:10 which says “ the sceptre shall not depart from Judah ” relating to “ Shiloh ” , one of many mess i- anic names for Jesus from the old testament. Aries is king of the sceptre or wand, so Judah is almost certainly Aries by the exaltation of the Sun. Simeon & Levi are called “ brothers ” Gen 49:5ff, drawing attention to Scorpio, in which Mars & Pluto are co - ruling. Simeon is fixed “ like a rock..in their anger they slew a man — into their secret come not, O my soul! ” That sounds a whole lot like Pluto i n fe rior and Mars su perior in the eighth house & court of the Queen of Cups. So Simeon is closely aligned with Mars in Scorpio, with anger and wrath,"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 111 death & the underworld of Pluton - Hades. Reuben is something of an anomaly, since “ mutable water ” is Pisces, but the south is clearly Capr i corn with Mars. There ’ s another biblical aspect to this analysis, which pertains to the signs of blessing vs the signs of curse. That ’ s very helpful because half the signs are accursed and the other h alf are purified. I ’ ll quote Deuteronomy: “ Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; A blessing, if ye obey the co m mandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day: And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go a f ter other gods, which ye have not known. And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to po s- sess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount *Gerizim, and the curse upon mount *Ebal ” — Deut 11:26 - 29 AV “ These shall stand upon mount *Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Ben - jamin: And these shall stand upon mount *Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. ” — Deut 27:12 - 13 AV Gerizim is the name of a mountain of Samaria some 3,000 feet a.s.l., which stands against Mount Ebal, about two miles from summit to summit. Ge rizim means cuttings off, souls cut - off by the Scythe from our earthly habitation dispatched to sojourn among the hea v ens above and below, each for their a p pointed time. Our souls are born again at the moment of death in the mortal body to experience our d iscarnate life in heaven. At the second death soul is cast down to Earth to live again in a new human body.

Again, Cancer is to the north, Capricorn is to the south, Aries to the east, Libra to the west. Cap, Sag, Sco, Lib, Vir, Leo are th e signs of blessing. Can, Gem, Tau, Ari, Pis, Aqu are the signs of cur s- ing. We already know Judah is east, Reuben is south, Ephraim is west, and Dan is north, as we know.

On average, the"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 113 Moon is slowly receding away from Earth, whilst the Sun is slowly closing the distance by r a- dial velocity, as if to affirm their astrological reputation. Judah is in the blessings group, while Reuben is in the cursings group. That would put Judah in Leo, and Reuben in Aries, the signs of the Sun - superior & Mars - inferior, respectively. Remember, the inferior signs refer to our soul in separation from heaven being cast down to Earth away from the planets r e ceding by radial velocity. This is to be born in sin, to be born the son of man, as all mere mortals are born to die. Death is the wages of sin. Be co n tent with your wages, the separation of soul from the te mple of the living, and reunion of soul in heaven. Next, the tribe of Joseph is Jacob ’ s eleventh son whose mother is Rachel. Joseph ’ s tribe is split into Manasseh and Ephraim, most likely Aquarius & Capricorn, the sign of Saturn inf e- rior & superior, respec tively. That draws attention to the order of birth, since the eleventh son correlates to the eleventh and tenth sign of the zodiac. Genesis 29:32, says that Reuben is the first - born child of Jacob & Leah, followed by Simeon, Levi, and Judah by the same par ents. There ’ s little doubt that Reuben must be Aries, & Judah must be Leo. Then Rachel ’ s han d- maiden Bilhah gives birth to Dan and Naphtali. Dan fits neatly with Pisces, perhaps because my name is Daniel, and I ’ m a Neptune exalted in Sagittarius beneath rul ing Jup i ter, God is my Judge. So we ’ ve identified several more signs. Issachar is of the blessings group, and is probably the sign of Libra, she who holds the scales of compensation, “ measure of wheat..three measures of barley for a penny ” [ref. Rev 6:6]. After all, it is Saturn, the Scythe who “ cuts off ” , and reaps the harvest. Libra is Saturn ’ s ex - altation, who we ’ ve already identified as Ephraim which is Capricorn, the superior aspect of Saturn. Thus Benja - min is Virgo, the last remaining superior ensi gn in the z o diac. That leaves just two signs to go, Gad and Asher. Now, this list is by no means gospel. It is just a best, educated guess based on reconciling the classic myth of divine pecking - order with the four directions, elements, three qual i ties, or der of birth, two orders of blessing by Jacob in Genesis 49 and Moses in Deuteronomy 33, and the blessings and cur s ings told by Moses in Deuteronomy 27, and the order given by John in Revel a tion 14:1, and the traditional meaning of the names of the twelve sons and tribes of Israel.

Uranus orbits on the oute r most edge of visibility to mans unaided eye at nearly twenty times the distance of Earth to the Sun. Uranus is almost “ rolling ” along its 84 - year orbit with the Sun, since its rotational axis is tipped some 82.14 degrees from perpendicular to its ecli p tic, or as astro nomers say “ 97.86 degrees retrograde ” because the usual west - to - east rotation of the planet is topsy - turvy. The sidereal daily rotation of Uranus is about 17 ¼ hou rs. At over 32,000 miles in equatorial d i- ameter, this finds the blue - green gas giant spinning around 5,800 miles an hour near its outer met h ane gas layer with mostly hydro - gen and helium in the denser clouds below. The moons of Uranus now number twenty - se ven with the tinier, fainter moons being discovered over time as instruments improve. While nowhere near the glory of Saturn ’ s majestic rings, Uranus does hold a relatively faint ring system, having ten thin and narrow bands encircling an eleventh, which i s just as thin but a lot broader and more diffuse than the outer rings — most of which are barely a mile across. The caelestial firmament and its Uranian influences are embodied in the eighth heaven manifest in this orbiting sphere of extremes we call Uran us, who is named for the Greek Ouranos, literally, the Earth ’ s caelestial sphere, all light that reaches the Earth from distant suns that bears witness to the infinite vastness of light and con - trasting darkness far beyond our own s o lar system, with innum erable souls who populate this illimitable expanse of cosmic proportions breathing life into worlds u n told. The extreme obliquity of Uranus ’ rotational axis to its ecliptic reflects the “ bipolar ” chara c- teristics of soul - journers in this region, spending s ome twenty - one years in each season b e- tween e quinoxes and solstices. The tem peratures are so frigid at the cloudy surface of Uranus, nearly - 200 C or - 320 F, that surface temperatures vary little around the whole planet regar d- less of the season. However, t he effect on souls is most drastic due to the extreme orie n tation of Uranus towards and away from the Sun near solstices, and perpendicularity near equinoxes. Rather this is the effect that souls have had on Uranus. Really both causative and effective rel a- tionships occur since neither planet nor soul could exist independently. As with each of the ten heavens, there is much to learn in the sphere of Uranus. Souls d e- velop the sense of the extreme, the free, unbridled and unrestrained — quick to push the env e- lop e of intemperance, thereby defining tem - perance by testing its outermost saturnine limits. Just how far can Saturn recede from Earth by radial velocity? Beyond Saturn, how far can any soul go towards infinity? What ’ re the limits of intempe r- ance?

Saturn teaches souls to yield to what is defined, while father Uranus invi tes soul to strive for new beginnings on the bass octave of the Moon, the beginning of heaven. Because Uranus is the superconscious octave of the Moon, Urania, the muse of astro n omy, adds her eighth pitch be - low the Moon ’ s A e olian s idereal mode on the A b elow mid dle C. This fixed sidere al mode of Uranus is then trans posed in the fixed synodic key of Aqua r ius, which is Bb - minor under ruling Uranus or Bb - mixolydian under Saturn. This innate sidereal modal resonance of Uranus with the Moon occurs on the Moon ’ s d e- scen d ing or superior octave, because Earth ’ s caelestial firmament is composed of the light reaching the Earth from distant suns and galaxies far beyond this relative “ pinpoint ” of our solar system. Think about this. The mean geocentric distance of Ear th to the Sun is about 8 minutes 19 seconds at light - speed, or about 0.000015813 light - years. Pluto averages nearly 39.5 astr o- nomical units to the Sun or about 5 ½ hours. Bright fiducial stars like A l debaran is estimated to be 65 light - years away. Spica 26 0 light - years. Polaris 430 light - years. Antares 600 light - years. Deneb ± 3200 ly. The nearest galaxy, Andr omeda (M31), is roughly 2.5 mil lion light - years away (using conventional light theory). Even nearby stars at ten or twenty light - years are many thousan ds of times further away than tiny Pluto is from our Sun. Yet, avera g ing a mere 238,860 miles from Earth, the Moon is infinitely further away than starlight that hits our eyes and intercepts our psychic eye at Earth ’ s geocenter. The Moon, the closest hea v e nly sphere to the Earth, is almost a quarter million miles away — up there in outer space. The Moon ’ s ps y- chic influence is made by each soul ’ s heavenly e x periences there, up there in the Moon, not here on Earth. We see only a tiny fragment of the total sun light (including eart h shine) that the Moon reflects while viewing it from Earth, or from any other position in local solar system space. What each soul ex periences in the Moon is remembered by the Moon, and by each soul who ’ s been there usually many times over. The relative sid e real position of the Moon in our solar sys - tem makes it innately the first heaven, and the natural minor m o dality. Whereas the synodic or “ light ” position of the Moon to Earth ’ s geocenter is where soul ’ s innate exper i ences in the Mo on are joined together with soul ’ s myriad discarnate experiences in the other nine planets over the aeons since this solar system ’ s inception. You see, it ’ s the system of our soul, ergo our “ sol ” system. An “ old ” soul is simply a term used to describe some one whose words and demeanor e x- ude wisdom beyond his or her years as often seen in a young child “ because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent ” [Mat 11:25]. As the child grows and gets caught up in worldly things, such heavenly inn o cence is lost. As the adult grows old, the soul seeks to realign itself with the divine gnosis in anticipation of r e turning to the heavens, out of the white oblivion (ref. chapter 13).

The point is to remember that soul ’ s experiences in the heavens are interdependent, as each planet to the other plan ets who together complete our sol - system. Like keys on a well - tuned piano, the well - attuned soul brings the diatonic modes of its experience into play hereon Earth in the chromatic z o diac of the elements or astrological forces to the Earth. But because the heavenly realms of soul ’ s disembodied sojourning are each at some distance from Earth, the Moon about 1 ¼ seconds at light - speed, or Uranus averaging 2 hours 40 minutes give or take the up to 8 1/3 minutes accounting for the Earth ’ s distance from the Sun, so you see that the planetary light which i n tersects our conceptual point at Earth ’ s geocenter is the same point shared by all the world relative to that aforesaid planetary light — same light, but is unique to each soul according to i ts cumulative experi ences there in, hence how that light acts and reacts with the souls on Earth, each whose body is born with tendencies based on his or her horoscope which fo l lows them through life, progressing in real - time with the relative light forces. In summary, the ele mental ergo astrologica l forces func tion at light - speed relative to the Earth, on the Earth. Soul ’ s discarnate sojourns in heaven occur in real - time, as does soul ’ s a c- tivity in the living earthly body. See? The planetary light is the relativity of force to Earth. B e- ing there is the ever - present consciousness of psyche. Space - time relates force relative to the heavens beyond. It ’ s like deja vu, which is to remember the present — in realtime. This awareness is subtle yet is very distinct. A di s tant memory is separated by light - years, while the deja vu memory is sep a rated by nothing, by no spacetime, yet is relative to the source of the light & sound that we are remembering. It ’ s analogous to taking a vacation in Hawaii. Pos t- cards just can ’ t do it justice. You have to be there to appreciate it...as with the Grand Canyon. Heaven is like that. You can try to explain how amazing and beautiful it is, but a soul must be there to see it, to experience firsthand the embrace of the divine light. So it is with the rel a ti ve astrological forces, and the gnosis of soul in the heavens then on earth in the body. The twenty - two divine archetypes are outside relativity of force to paraphrase Cayce [3744 - 4]. That ’ s the major arcana. The minor arcana are the courtyards and planets of the horoscope, hence are relative to physical forces. The superconscious is associated with the “ aether ” , the conscious essence of soul that ’ s poured out on the sons and daughters of the Creator, as water from a container, each co n- tainer one of the ten vast regions of the pl ane tary heavens who together compose our solar system from the Moon to Pluto that is to say from the Moon to Earth.

Just as Saturn ’ s superior house is king of gravity, the creative force of the world signified by Capricorn, the inferior house of Saturn is queen of spades, sustaining consciousness through psychic awareness — which is a bit redundant since to be psychic is to be aware, and to be aware is to be psychic.

You see, it ’ s being there that empowers the astrological forces i n di vidually for each soul, and col lectively for every soul born of this vast solar system. Why, you may ask, do I drive this point home repeatedly? Because today ’ s astrologers have been repeatedl y misled by those who were similarly misled for many generations. It ’ s like they were taught for centuries that 2 + 2 = 5. So you can ask any modern - day astrologer some questions about astrology, like “ what ’ s two plus two? ” and you ’ ll inevitably get the sa me a n- swer, “ five ” . While it ’ s easy to sit back and criticize such gullible simpletons, the truth is that for anyone to acknowledge the egregiously traumatic memory of being banished from heaven and cast into hell is not an easy thing to do — not for any hu man being on Earth. That ’ s the p o sition, the point of entry from heaven into hell. And Yes, that ’ s the second death written about by John the revelator, in his apokalupsis. What and where hell actually is has been a longstanding point of contention among t he o r- thodox. Of course there is Hades, the realm of the dead b e neath the ground, and clear down to the center of the Earth where Pluto rules. Then there is living hell, which describes the lives of certainly hundreds of mi llions of star - crossed souls in car nate in a sea of bad karma, and probably most people who ’ ve ever lived have met with some hellish misfortune at one time or another. But if you haven ’ t, then you ’ re either very fo r tunate, or you ’ ve led a very boring life. There ’ s a third kind of hell, whic h is the interface of the previous two — what we mortals call the spirit world. This is where the departed make co n tact with the living and vice versa, or sometimes vis - a - vis between the dead and the living — both equally surprised to see the other. The sp ectral world of the supernatural supports a whole range of apparitions from archangels to horrific demons, and just about everything in between. Encounters with a ghost are usually very frightening. Even visits by arch - angels i n spire fear in the hearts of the bravest of men. And when demons of Tartaros rise up from the abyss, the terror can be so unnerving as to scare any one to death. Thus begs the question, “ where does hell end and heaven begin? ” I ’ ve always believed that if a diehard debunker wants to s pend the night all alone in a torture chamber deep in the heart of some super - haunted medieval castle, then let that brave debunker stand forth and be counted."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 121 Imagine yourself all alone, down in the deepest hold of the Queen Mary from sunset till sunup, a nd on the night of a full moon — no one else on board.

No one is around to h ear your cries for mercy. Or stay in Char - leville castle with similar preconditions, or you might prefer the immense du n geon of Chillingham castle? Spend the night in any torture chamber in the Tower of London. Devil ’ s Island is said to be awfully haunted . You can ’ t go wrong by camping out in one of the brick huts at the Auschwitz - Birkenau concentration - execution camps — alone, at night, not a living soul around to hear your shrieks. A plain old - fashioned haunted house would be a c ceptable, provided it has earned a reputation for being extremely haunted, like one of the “ scariest places on earth ” . As long as you are willing to try it, you should go for it. Make sure a major broadcaster like FOX is there to back you up, so the whole world can know you act u all y did it. But it ’ ll never happen since debunkers are all talk and no action. The risks are too great and the challenge is too demanding. All alone with no way of escaping and no body around to rescue you from whatever — whoever — makes contact with you from beyond the grave. Those debunkers don ’ t believe in spirits, so what are they so afraid of? I ’ ll tell you what scares them and everybody els e inclu ding me...malevolent spirits! That ’ s what scares us all, since that ’ s where hell below and hell above are uni ted. Recall Peter ’ s denial of Christ “ thrice before the cock crow ” [Mat 26:34,75 ibid]. In a few words, talk ’ s cheap, show me don ’ t tell me, faith without works, prove it or else, do it first then you can brag about it later, etc. E x traordinary claims requ ire extraordinary proof. Don ’ t say “ I ’ m not afraid to spend the night all alone in the Tower of London under lock and key ” , unless you ’ ve done it already, or you plan to do it in the imminent future. We ’ ll see if you ’ re serious, or merely fooling yourself. You may be crazy enough to try it — that would be insane! There are surely many cemeteries, mausoleums, catacombs and other uninviting places in the world that rival the Tower ’ s foreboding allure. Old lighthouses, pubs, clubs, restaurants, hotels, abandon ed psychiatric wards, hospi - tals, prisons, sites of murders, warcrimes, old bridges, just about anything else you can think of that ’ s likely to be haunted by malevolent spirits — put it on the list. If you think that you would not be afraid, you ’ d better think again. They say the C o- losseum built cir. 75 AD in Rome is rated as the most outrageously haunted place in Italy after dark, especially for the psychic sensitives, those who get “ messages ” from the stone building blocks. This ability is known as psych ometry. The old monuments where murders and torture were common tend to overwhelm such individuals. Somehow, the crystalline structure of the rocks enables & su s tains the impressing of memories upon them. How is best discerned among the alchemist or minera logist, the psychic medium or physicist, the rock - hound or"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 122 geologist, the astrophile or chemist, plus any other neighboring supernatural or scientific di s- cipline. This crystalline memory is directly responsible for the powers of Mnemosyne, mother of the m usic of the spheres, to remember for many lifetimes into the distant past or for geological aeons, depen d ing on the age of the rocks in question. This is the medium by which Earth ’ s memory remains intact. One would presume that younger volcanic rocks have barely begun to “ remember ” , beginning at the moment the magma cooled and solidified into its igneous fo r- mations. How quickly or slowly the magma cools deter - mines its composition. Lava pouring out of a vo l cano is cooled very quickly, forming finer - grained glassy rocks like pumice, scoria, obsidian and most commonly, basalt. Then there ’ s underground magma that cools slowly before nearing the Earth ’ s surface, pr o- ducing coarsely - grained rocks like granite with its components feldspar, quartz, mica, etc. N o- tab ly about sixty percent of Earth ’ s crust is made of feldspar, and most all igneous rocks contain some variety of it. 80% of the Earth ’ s crust is igneous rock so it becomes the focus of crystalline psychometry. Quartz crystals like amethyst are very popular, because the ancient Greeks believed it can prevent intoxication. Perhaps they meant that it can promote lucidity of mind. Amethyst is the color of Aquarius, Capricorn and P i sces. Diamonds are forever or so it is said. While diamond is certainly the hardes t naturally o c- curring rock on Earth, and the most brilliant, it is nowhere near the toughest. Weak atomic bonds along a diamond ’ s cleavage plane make it brittle, even breakable when struck by a hard object. Jadeite, a metamorphic rock, has interlocking str ucture, making it the toughest, but not hardest gemstone around. Thus different types of rock make for different ability to psychically connect with its me m- ory. Mans attraction to precious & semiprecious gems imply added suitability as psychic cat a- lysts be yond the more common stones. The alchemist has made a science of such studies, and Edgar Cayce ’ s readings promote gemstones in holistic medicine. On this foundation of met a- physics is judicial astrology, for the planets themselves and our souls were formed by the ca r- dinal, fixed and mutable laws. Interdisciplinary studies is the watchword of erudition, hence pattern re - cognition crosses all bounds, and examines all sciences in general. Obviously no one person can know everything (although Leonardo Da Vinci sure gave it a go), so team - work will produce better quality data than solo efforts. Assembling such a team of metaphys i- cians would be ideal, especially if each team member were a trained scientist in a specialized field, having developed psychic senses. Eventually, mankind will integrate his science with the supernatural. When he does, comprehension will increase an hundredfold, and understanding of death will be made plain — just as Cayce said it would. Centuries will pass. When you find the memory of yo ur second death, then you will appreciate biblical pa s- sages such as “ and fear not them which kill... but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell ” [Mat 10:28].

Ne p- tune ’ s orbit is about two - thirds that at 164.79 years. Neptune, who se universal a r chetype is the Hermit of the major arcana, has an orbital eccentricity of only 0.0086, which is barely more than that of Venus. Compare Pluto ’ s eccentricity at a whopping 0.2488, or a fourth again greater ratio b e tween major and minor axis. Combined with Pluto ’ s steep orbital inclination over 17 degrees co m- pared to Neptune ’ s milder 1.77 degrees slope, and Pluto ’ s mean heliocentric distance of 3,670,000,000 miles or less than a third more than Neptune ’ s distance from the Sun, and you ’ ll see wh y these ancient brothers cross paths every two and a half centuries, th e rearound. The third planet beyond the path of his younger brother Jupiter, Neptune, known as P o- seidon in the Greek, there - fore holds the trident — third also by the element water whic h is Pisces, the Hanged Man of tarot, which Jupiter rules in his inferior aspect and Neptune rules superior. At 2,796,000,000 miles from the Sun, the temperature on the surface of this blue gas g i ant stays relatively con - stant at - 200C or - 328F, very near ly the same as Uranus, as is its compos i- tion. Neptune is only a bit smaller at 30,800 miles in equatorial diameter, spinning around at 16 hours 7 minutes per sid e real day, or 6,000 miles per hour at the surface on the equator. The tilt of Neptune on its ro tational axis is more than 29 ½ degrees, but like Ur a nus, is much too far from the Sun to affect sur - face temperatures between se a sons, at 41.2 years apiece. Recall from my Tarot Manual chap 3, the 3:2:1 resonance of Mercury, which rotates on its nearly p lumb axis with its ecli p tic exactly 1.5000 times each 360 - degree orbit (87.97046 earth - days) around the Sun, so that one solar day on Mercury averages exactly two sidereal years, and three sidereal rotations of Mercury equals two sidereal orbits, hence its 3:2:1 ratio of day - to - year resonances. There ’ s a 3:2 resonance between Neptune and Pluto, such that Pluto ’ s angular mome n tum achieves equilibrium with Neptune by slowly librating between steeper orbits with r e duced tangential velocities, then by declining orbits with elevated tangential velocities, thereby pr e- venting any possible coll i sion between them — at least in theory. While a theory can come and go, we can be sure that the earliest life forms on Earth probably date back several billion years. So even with all the catastrophic events of geological antiquity, life has managed to find a way to survive and thrive through rain, hail, sleet or snow, through massive crustal displacements, earthquakes, vol - canoes, meteoroids, famine, pest i lence, war, natural se lection, etc. Yet through it all, life goes on on Earth."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Chapter 12 124 This is because the universe itself is one vast, living organism.

In the original Greek, the word for pebble is “ psephos ” , which means a transparent or white pebble smoothed and rounded, like those most commonly found in a river bed. The word psephos is also used for a transparent quartz lens used to focus sunlight to ignite fires, or to mag - nify something up close. Its root word “ psallo ” refers to singing a melody or hymn, and vibr a tions of strings made by plucking or bowing them in order to play music, to sing hymns by instrumental accompaniment, e.g. harp, hence to “ magnify ” the Gods by hymnodic praise in song.

Acoustical physics, the production, transmission, absor - ption, refl ection, control, effect and general behavior of audible and inaudible sound is a sc i ence all its own. As human beings, especially those with an ear for music of whatever genre you like, we know what sounds good to our ears — and conversely what doesn ’ t.

Dealing with ast rology simplifies things for the purpose of this discus - sion, since we ’ re only co n cerned with the well - tempered twelve - tone scale centered on middle C (C4 of the piano) which is 261.63 Hz by the usual American - standard pitch, putting A4 (the first A above middle C) at about 440 Hz, d e- pending on the temperament used to tune an instrument. Subtle changes in temperament can have a sign ificant im - pact on the listener. A mere one cycle - per - second delta to any tone in the scale can make a major difference in how the i n- strument sounds when played. Similarly a note played hard will momentarily attain a higher pitch than its sustained resolu tion on most acou s tical instruments. But the softer it is played, the more uniform its pitch. The standard pitch for the ascending chromatic scale on C4 up to the C5 o c tave is tuned to the A 440 as follows:  C 261.63  C# 277.18  D 293.66  Eb 311.13  E 329.63  F 349.23  F# 369.99  G 392.00  Ab 415.30  A 440.00  Bb 466.16  B 493.88  C ’ 523.25 This is called “ equal ” temperament, since the frequency between each neighboring tone is multiplied by the 12th - root of 2 (1.05946 30943592952645618252949463) ascending and its reciprocal (0.94387431268169349664191315666753) descending.

Even so, there ’ s no electronic device that can equal an acoustic instrument, but they do come closer and closer herein the 21st ce n tury. The chromatic frequency charts shown above work well in theory, but an a ctual piano is dependent on the reality of its design and construction, its co n- dition and maintenance, its overall quality like the Steinway or Bosendo r fer concert grands, or a common upright. Each piano behaves slightly different from the next, hence the skilled p i- ano tuner must employ methods of counting “ beats ” between intervals that are sui t able for that particular piano. Basically, this stretches an octave slightly due to the stiffness of piano wire, and each octave behaves a little differently. There are two basic methods for tuning p i- anos, but ultimately it ’ s up to the ear of the person tuning the piano which results in a plea s- ing and smooth musical sound when it ’ s played."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 131 Two popular methods are the “ Defebaugh F - F Temperament ” in which slower - beating i n- tervals of fourths and fifths are the dominant tuning refe r ence, using faster - beating thirds and sixths to make sure the fourths & fifths are in tune to specification. Or, there ’ s the newer “ Po t- ter F - A Te m perament ” which essentially reverses the process , tuning and checking by thirds and sixths, then checking the fourths and fifths. This latter process extends the temperament octave to one and a third, and is easier to hear and count the interval beat of inharmonic pa r- tials. There are, of course, a pleth ora of variations on these piano tuning methods but the b a- sics remain true for all. By counting the number of beats per second between coin - cident partials of any two fu n- damental tones, somewhere in the series of partials we can find one beating suffi - ci ently close to the other as to count the beats by ear. Provided one of these two tones is properly tuned, then the other key can be retuned until the proper number of beats per second can be heard. An expert tuner knows to set the tuning pins by correct fe el of the tuning lever, while simu l- taneously setting the strings by playing the string loudly as the tuning settles to pitch — enough to equalize the tension across load bearing points of each string while maintaining the desired pitch. In any case, the tun er begins by making sure that the A above middle C is tuned precisely to 440 Hz, and also that the piano is generally in tune, before attempting any fine tu n ing. Ideally, for a piano to stay in tune, it needs to be in a climate - controlled environment, sinc e radical changes in temperature will throw even the finest pianos out of tune. In such cases, tuning near the equinoxes is about all you can do to minimize the effects of heat and cold. Before the digital revolution, tuning forks were common - ly used to t une A4 (440), C5 (523.252), or F4 (349.228). A - 440 is the most popular sta n dard, which is the key of Saturn - superior, the Mixolydian modality in the sign of Capricorn.

An A - 440 played with a A - 445 makes 5 beats per second. Lastly, the theoretical intervals aren ’ t exactly practical, since every partial above the fundamental pitch is somewhat sharper than it “ sounds ” on paper. For e x- ample A - 440 uses three strings tuned in beat - free unison, meaning each string is tuned to 440 Hz, making that key sound bright and strong when played. Each octave above and below this sta n dard pitch must be tempered to be slightly wider than m athematical theory dictates. It ’ s li ke taking a rubberband and wrap ping it lengthwise around a 12 ” ruler, and marking each inch - mark on the rubberband with a pen. Holding one end of the rubberband to the ruler, stretch your rubberband beyond the other end of the ruler by about a quarter of an inch, and pay attention to how the increments on the rubberband are proportionally — cumulatively — widened as compared with the fixed ruler. The further out that you stretch the rubberband, the wider each interval beco mes, and these differences are compounded over twelve spaces. The same thing happens on the well - tempered piano, such that the highest treble note may be 30 pennies sharp of math e matical theory alone, while the deepest bass notes can reach 40 pennies flat — all the while A - 440 stays at exactly 440 Hz. Concert grands have longer bass strings, which require less stretch than the ordinary baby grand.

However, because the nat ural harmonic series is mathema tically perfect, its theoret i- ca l ove r tones are harmonic across every octave ad infinitum.

You can count for five or so se c- onds, then multiply the beats by 5 or so to increase its accuracy. E.g., the fifth partial of C3 which is 654.07 Hz, is near the fo urth partial of E3 which is 659.26, with a difference of 5.19 Hz, or close to 26 beats per five seconds. Note the ratio of this in - terval is 5:4, and is a major third. It should be noted here that all thirds, fourths and sixths are wide inter - vals, while all fifths are narrow inte r vals. The octave of any key is tempered by the second partial of the bot - tom note with the fundamental of the octave above, such that the inherent shar p ness of the lower note ’ s partial causes the well - tempered octave to be stre tched thereby in reference to the compensating - flatness of the bottom fundamental tone. By comparing all of the partials with both tones of an o c tave being tuned, ratios of partials can be used to fine - tune a specific range, like 4:2, or 6:3, meaning 4th o f the lower and 2nd of the higher, or 6th of the lower and 3rd of the upper. Which ratios are used depends a lot on that particular piano being tuned. That ’ s because the actual series of partials themselves are inherently stretched above the fundamental to which they ’ re referenced so that the higher the partial, then the greater the delta between theoretical frequency and actual frequency.

A second of time is referenced to the long - term average of one solar day on Earth, which day is subdivided into twelve incr e- ments of two hours apiece, ergo twenty - four increments of one hour each. One hour is co m- posed of 60 minutes, so one solar day equals 1,440 minutes. Minutes are broken down into seconds, making 86,400 seconds per mean solar day. Therefore, one second equals 1/86,400th of a mean solar day. When we think of cycles - per - second, we ’ re really thinking of equal fractions of a solar day. There ’ r e also sidereal definitions of one mean sidereal day on Earth, which is similarly su b- divided by sidereal hours, minutes and seconds. The sidereal day is defined as 23h 56m 04.1s of mean solar time, about 0.9972796759 parts of a mean solar day. A - 440 is abo ut 438.803057 Hz sidereal - to - solar. Middle C at 261.625565 Hz solar time drops down to 260.9139 Hz sidereal - to - solar time. These conversions are made relative to solar time, thus A - 440 in sidereal cycles - per - second equals only 438.803057 Hz in solar time. Conversely, A - 440 in solar time is equal to about 441.200 sidereal cycles - per - second. Given that Earth ’ s m e- ridian houses are sidereal, and are “ tempered ” by the approximately 23.439 degree obliquity of Earth ’ s rotational axis to her ecliptic, attunement wi th houses and their planetary signs of the horoscope is analogous to musical tuning and temperament — exemplary of a piano. The strings are the planets attuned with their sidereal orbits, the keys are the ensigns, and the m u- sic is life. Consider also the p artials of light, knowing the octave above red is ultra - viole t, while the octave above infra red is violet. Humans can ’ t see infrared or ultr a violet, but we can certainly feel their effects on the body. So each and every octave of existence can be sensed by the ps y- che through attunement with each spiral of vibration, by listening to the waves within its range of frequency, listening also for its harmonic and inharmonic partials, much as the pla n- ets form spiral orbits with the Sun, as the solar system orbits the Milky Way forever spiraling outward toward the solar apex in this arm of the galaxy.

This is the perfect mood, as it is used in the ancient language. And the imperfect mood is the essence of the minor arcana which is temporal or corporeal, demonstrated by the existence of life in the physical body, subject to the temporal forces of nature as horoscopic forces are natal portraits in progression. Think of life as tuning intervals of different partials, as you li s ten for inharmonic overtones in sympathy with inharmonics of other keys, completing a sidereal ci r cle for each octave of the zodiac which spirals ever onward. The famous “ phaistos disk ” that was discovered in Crete in 1908 at the ruins of an a n cient Minoan palace, is an ancient horoscope complete with planets, signs and lots, all sy m bolized by strangely famil iar icons. About 6 1/3 inches in diameter, and less than one inch in thic k- ness, it has 122 glyphs on one side and 119 on the other. The houses on the perimeter on each side number twelve, and nearly encircle a spiral path towards the center, which pat h way begins with a small gap between the first house and the twelfth house, and this ’ s typical of both sides. The spiral paths form 19 cells on one side and 17 cells on the other.

Pluton - Hades awaits..."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" C HAPTER 13 A T THE CENTER OF THE E ARTH , Pluto resides from superior aspect in the midst of heaven along the axis of Earth ’ s diurnal rotation. At the center of the zodiac, centered in the realm of da ily activity, Pluto is less than 1500 miles in equatorial diameter, and has a solar day equal to about 6.4 Earth - days. Pluto ’ s temperature is - 355* F on average, and has very little surface gravity, due to its relatively low volume and mass, at 1/200th of Earth and 1/400th of Earth, respectively. Like Earth, Pluto ’ s the only other planet in our solar system with one moon, Charon which is notably about half the size of its host and always faces the same way thereto. But unlike Earth, Pluto is tidally locked with Charon, so Pluto is always facing the same way to Charon — making Charon ’ s sidereal orbit of Pluto equal to Pluto ’ s sidereal daily rotation period averaging 6 earth - days, 9 hours and 17.6 minutes, tracing out an highly bar y centric orbit with each other, almost a “ binary ” system sep a rated by only 12,500 miles. Like Venus and Uranus, Pluto is an “ upside down ” planet, around 120 degrees oblique to its ecliptic with the Sun. Pluto has an atmosphere 100,000 times less than Earth ’ s at sealevel (14.7 psi, ergo ~0.00015 psi on Pluto), and attains this ultra - thin pressure approaching per i- helion, when the icecaps at Pluto ’ s poles slowly evaporate then gradually recondense when Pluto pulls away from the Sun. Pluto is verily the Fool of the major arcana, the tenth he aven known as the Empireum or Empyrean, the “ practice ” of heaven and habitation of the Gods atop Mount Olympus. Guarding the broad gates of Hell is the ferocious three - headed Cerberus (Gk. Kerbero v ) with an hundred eyes and tail of the Dragon — symbol of Jupiter ’ s favorite Hekate, the dar k- ening Moon. The Cerberus welcomes souls as they e n ter through Hades ’ wide - open gates, but will bare his razor - sharp fangs at any soul who dares to look back or return from whence it did first enter this gloomy abode. Iden tifying just who — and what — Hades is is easy enough astrologically and mytholog i- cally. But for each soul in the afterlife, experiences are as d i verse as the number of discarnate souls. Pluto exerts two aspects. First is the Empireum, heaven - on - earth, the tenth heaven of soul and body together i m mortal. Second is death, the rivers of perdition for tormented souls, shades of death whose “ unfinished business ” precludes them from cros s ing over. They must wander the shores of the river Styx eternally or until such time as they ’ re willing to let go of what ever earthly thing had po s sessed them or held them back. Souls who hold back in life are also held back in death. The gold coins are symbolic of the wages of kindness in which a soul has profited in life. The f erryman, Charon, guides the kind and generous soul across these venomous rivers t o- ward the other side, toward the white light of heaven, the right side of God into the bosom of Abraham."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 137 Much is written about the dark side of Hades, where the malevolent and uncaring d e scend into damnation, each to the degree not so much which they did evil, but more so their failure to do good — their indifference to justice and inju s tice, their tepid apathy toward our fellow man. This is the judgment of the accursed, not ag ainst devil or despot, but against those who stood by d o ing nothing. So these rivers are flowing with consciousness of guilt, as the fires of Phlegethon, the la m- entations of Cocytus, the sorrows of Acheron, the obli v ions of Lethe, and the hatreds of Styx. What a soul does in life, soul does in death. The idea being, fire is cooled by water, l a ments are soothed by laughter, sorrow by joy, indifference by remembrance, and hatred by love. The soul must do these good things in life, as the opportunity presents itself. In the afte r life, those doers of the good are separated from evildoers, such that the good souls cannot comfort the souls of wickedness, neither can the wicked intrude upon the good, for a vast chasm separates good from bad. Only in the circle of l ife can the two coexist, yin and yang. But in the a f terlife they are kept apart by chaos. This unnerving misty white and bespeckled infinite void of Chaos is the grandest terror of the universe. A soul who detaches itself and enters therein cannot return t o memory but is pulled away in the bottomless nothingness, scattered to the swirling winds, a soul is lost fo r- ever. Out of this endless vacuum of emptiness, Erebus and Nyx, the gloomy subterraneous ca v- ern that leads to Hades and his sister Night were born, and who in turn bare Aether, the pure essence of the astrological el e ment Air (essen tial superconsciousness of the heavenly spheres) Swords of tarot and Spades of hoyle, and his sister Hemera the Daylight of the Sun. And Er e- bus & Nyx also begat Charon. Ma ns continuous cycle of death and life, transmigration of his or her soul from one phys i- cal body unto the next, the planetary cadence of evening and morning from Earth and to the Earth, since mans fall in the garden of Eden, this great war of ten sidereal y ears between the Titans and Olympians will come to fruition in the resurrection. Certainly the Bible is the best place to read about the resurrection of the dead, so we won ’ t belabor the point. Suffice to say that the Xian gospel of Christ - crucified is the most translated, published and widely read pages of any book in recorded history. Even Josephus reminded readers in his discourse to the Greeks concerning Hades (see Min ’ s Light & Sound, ch. 8) that “ for all men, the just as well as the unjust, shall be b rought before God the word..whom we call Christ...whom God and the Father hath glorified: concer n ing whom we have elsewhere given a more particular account.. ” That ’ s saying a lot coming from such a detail - oriented hist o- rian, and it is unambi - guously clear that the new testament gospels & epi s tles are exactly what Flavius Josephus was refe r ring to here."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Chapter 13 138 But the point of this book is to promote biblical astro - logy through the study and awar e- ness of the ten planets in their sidereal orbits and the twelve sig ns they make from their sy n- odic orbits to Earth. Ancient Babylon i ans are historically the best astrologers east of the Mayan empire. The M a goi, or “ wise men ” described in the first book of the New Testament, Matthew, were from Babylonia, Persia, Parthia, a nd probably elsewhere in Asia, Africa, and from as far east as India. For there were many more than the three kings bearing gold, frankincense & myrrh who would do obeisance to the young child Jesus. But it was the three royal astrologers whose visit is re corded in Ma t thew who would define the biblical astrologer for posterity. Old Testament astrologers include Job, Moses, the prophet Daniel and his co m panions (see Ch. 4), plus others lesser known. Jesus said there would be signs in the Sun, Moon & Stars. T he book of Revelation, given by Jesus ’ own angel to John is nearly a carbon copy of the more ancient prophecies of Daniel which were well known to the Magoi, and to the whole Roman Empire by the time that Caesar A u gustus came to power. Nostradamus & Cayce are two unrivaled examples of la t ter - day biblical astro logers whose devotion to Christ was wholly self - evident and unimpeachable. And yet, hardly any modern - day Xians know about biblical astrology since they ’ ve been misled by teachers who were similarly mi sled by their teachers. At least most of them are devout in their faith, if not known for their genius. The secular crowd are really no better off, in fact they show many of the same symptoms as their fundie Xian counterparts — easily misled by the teacher s who were misled by their teachers ad infin i- tum, making a rather unique q uandary for us biblical astrolo gers. Most religious fundamenta l- ists denounce astrology ad hoc while the atheists do pretty much the same thing. They were misled by their teac h ers to shun or mock that which they ’ ve never studied or understood even r e motely. Who then is left to study the bible and study astrology? Modern astroillogers haven ’ t got a clue about the bible or biblical astrology. Mo d ern atheists are no different. Modern Xian s know plenty of the bible, but little about its mythological, tarotlogical and astrological mea n- ing. The moral of the story being Unless you find the gospel and judicial astrology to be of paramount importance to you then you ’ re better off keeping yoursel f in the dark. Planetary Awareness In the multifaceted co n sciousness of Pluto, the planets are focused on our conceptual point at the geocenter of Earth (which is a bit redundant, since geo derives from Gaea). As you ’ ll recall, this point is foremost in mans own mind, a calculated point of zero dimension. When we “ squeeze ” the soul through this venturi of no n existence, soul ’ s existential qualities are stripped away and left behind in the temporal world — with only its pure aether remaining in this a r-"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Mi n’s Planetary Awareness Technique 139 chety pal, ergo perfect mood of soul, the essence of soul which can never die or disint e grate. When that soul returns to a new Earth and in a new body, the part of soul that was left behind is regathered out of its elemental ashes and r e stored anew as the newbor n infant draws its first breath of life. Discarnate souls in heaven are drawn to this new life by their a g gregate karma in their lives as ancestors. Each soul ’ s position to the Earth from the zenith of its planetary sou l- journ, that position between the Asc endant and Midheaven deter - mines the minutes and hours of time sep a rating the live birth of the infant and the soul intercepting that body. That ’ s why Cayce says the soul joins the body in 2390 - 2: “ It(soul) enters either at the first breath physically dra wn, or during the first twenty - four hours of cycle activity in a material plane. Not always at the first breath; sometimes ther e are hours, and there are chan ges even of personalities as to the seeking to enter. ” Thus, in those rare cases where the souljou rning planet has just transited midheaven at the time of birth, then that planet has until about the same time the fo l lowing day to transit again. The horoscope locates that planet from which soul takes its flight, usually fallen, often - times debilitate, sometimes e x alted, only rarely ruling therein. I ’ ve covered such techniques at length a l ready in my other books and articles available on my webpages. Searching the heavens within reveal each planet and its aspect to soul and body. E.g. to soul, archetypal Aries is the “ Ram ” of ambition, the tarot Devil. While to the body Aries is the Ego, and the courtyard of the King of Wands. Both soul - Aries and body - Aries are ruled by Mars - inferior (receding malefic by radial velocity), but the soul is in the perfect m ood while the body is imperfect mood. The heavens are archetypal, The earth is temporal. Thus, heaven on earth is - both - archetypal and temporal. This is why receding Mars elicits malefic or aggre s- sive expression in the earthly lives of souls who incarnate d from the Martian souljourn past their heavenly reprieve, at the point of b e ing cast down from heaven, that point in time and space where a soul is r e turned to the Earth, which again is rightly defined as soul ’ s point of entry. A person who by his or her own volition overrides these a d verse influences of Mars needn ’ t be subordinate there - to. But most people already are by nature, and by force, given to knee - jerk hostility for which Ares is infamous. Many of us will have contact with Pluto - inferior before we experience our own deaths, pa r- ticularly in the realm of hauntings. Paranormal investigators classify various apparitions into recognizable categories: orbs or ghost - lights, spirits, residuals, ectoplasm, vortexes, shades, poltergeists, demons, angels, guardians, guides, echoes, spectres, phantoms, elementals, ba n- shees, fairies, rods, ghouls, vampires, possessions, wraiths, zombies, dopple - gangers, rev e- nants, phantasms, ghosts and what have you. Other circumstances of contact include the NDE, or near - d eath experience. Certain types of psychoactive or anti - psychotic drugs can induce such otherworldly perception, especially in psychically - sensitive individuals. Causes of ghostly encounters have been attributed to bad bread made from ergot - contaminated ry e"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Chapter 13 140 grain, the misidentifi - cation of mushrooms or other exa m ples of food poisoning. But in most reported hauntings, the strongest drug used was coffee, nicotine, and maybe a glass of wine or beer. In other words the hauntings were real not hallucinated. Suc h encounters with the other side, as called the dark side or night side, can be very u n- settling, and each of us must deal with it face to face in the afterlife. But the superior a s pect of Pluto is the central hub of life, the portent of all the good things in the universe, the gladness of souls living in the body of heaven on earth, which is the ekklesia or body of Christ...new Jerusalem. This is the same Phoenix who rises up from the ashes of its former life, born of the Earth - Mother travailing in birth, t he resurrection.
