In the modern world, sickness is more often the result of ignorance of the laws governing the spiritual, mental, and emo - tional forces operating in people’s lives. This book makes available a wide variety of evi - dence bearing on the theory and practice of Metaphysical Medicine. The first part is historical, the second tech - nical, with both parts relating to beliefs held at the present time. This includes practices of Witch Doctors and Native American medi - cine priests; dream diagnosis as practiced by followers of Asclepius, god of medicine; early clinics of Hippocrates; mystical healing by early Christian priests; esoteric physiology and anatomy; the pineal gland; faith therapy; mental healing and others; and the psycho - logical factors contributing to illness. a b o u t t H e a u t H o r | Manly P.

It is not difficult to detect empirical viewpoints, because they are always in conflict with the results of clinical study. The theorist does not have the mental flexibility which comes to those who must adapt their opinions to the diversity of actual practice. There is no doubt that a considerable part of so-called spiri - tual healing is, in reality, nothing but suggestion therapy, but this obviously is unknown to many who practice the healing arts. Much of religious healing especially is suggestion or auto- suggestion, and the results obtained arise from a sincere convic - tion that such results can be obtained. This is not a formal or technical treatise, but a faithful ac - count of things known through experience. In working with those variously afflicted it is necessary to adapt formulas to the problems arising from individual experiences, traditions, and dispositions. It is in failure to so adapt the psychological tech - nique that many mistakes arise in the field of psycho-therapy. Special emphasis is laid upon ailments arising from reli - gious causes, because such cases have dominated my personal experience. There is no confusion worse confounding than that confounded by religious beliefs. And to date very little practi - cal information is available concerning religious ailments and their treatment. This book is divided into two sections, of which the first is historical, and the second technical and clinical. The historical section, however, is far more practical to present day problems than might at first appear.

In the modern world, sickness is more often the result of ignorance of the laws gov - erning the spiritual, mental, and emotional forces operating in people’s lives. In our effort to conquer externals we have failed to meet the challenge of the internal existence. In remote times the tribes which inhabited the earth were mostly nomadic. They migrated, sometimes considerable dis - tances, in search of better hunting or more fertile fields, driven from their old homes by scarcity of game or impoverished soil. By their wanderings these savages escaped many of the diseases which afflict modern mankind. When these nomads began to establish permanent com - munities their health problems increased immediately. The wanderer had left his refuse behind and moved into a healthier environment, but the builder of cities piled his refuse on the outskirts of the old towns and villages, and here a great part of the sickness that still plagues our race had its origin. It is only within the last hundred years that the sanitation problems of the large city have been solved. The sixteenth cen - tury Florentines drove herds of swine through the streets of introduction"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"14 Healing, the Divine Art Florence to scavenge the filth that was thrown from the win - dows of both palaces and humble dwellings. The swine were later butchered and eaten. Conditions in Venice were so bad that most of the Doges contracted smallpox, even in the luxuri - ous surroundings of the Ducal Palace. London had very little sanitation as late as the end of the eighteenth century. Improper nutrition also played a large part in the health problems of our remote ancestors. They depended upon sea - sonal hunting for most of their food, and had no adequate way of preserving meat. Explorers have described how the less ad - vanced natives of certain African tribes, especially the pygmies, will devour raw the putrefying remains of an animal that has lain dead for days in a tropical jungle. A diet of partly decom - posed fish is now regarded as responsible for some of the most dreaded diseases of Asia, including the leprosy so common in China. Were it not that nature had met this challenge of wrong diet with the mechanism of immunities, it is doubtful if the human species could have survived. Ventilation was another mystery to our noble forebears. Their caves and dens never were touched by the purifying rays of the sun, and cross ventilation was utterly beyond their com - prehension. And when men began to build houses, their prin - cipal concern was protection; and every unnecessary aperture was only another hazard. Not until the present century did laws enacted and enforced make adequate ventilation compul - sory in private dwellings, factories and public buildings. And many were the private protests to this extravagant procedure. Infant mortality has always been high among primitive people. This is not alone because of the natural hazards, but the very process of birth has usually been involved in religious ceremonials and rituals not always conducive to the survival of the mother or the offspring. The queens of Egypt were re - quired by the state to be delivered of their children in a pub - lic ceremony, while seated on the Birth Throne. Beating was"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Introduction 15 widely used among savage tribes to hasten childbirth. Medieval physicians found it entirely beneath their dignity to attend a confinement, unless the parents were of royal or noble estate. There is a reputable account of a hog-gelder being called in to perform a Caesarian section. More recently, midwives carried blunderbusses which they fired close to the expectant mother’s ear to hasten delivery. Surgery and bone-setting were among the brighter spots in ancient medical practice. Injuries suffered in war and while hunting took a dreadful toll in the good old times. This class of physical misfortune was probably the first to receive intelligent attention. The causes of such injuries were obvious, and there was less of the mysterious to hinder consideration of the facts. The Edwin Smith Papyrus indicates that the Egyptians had an excellent understanding of surgery at least two thousand years before the Christian Era. Examinations of ancient, possibly prehistoric, skulls show that even trepanning was performed successfully at a remote time. Also, several excellent examples of early dentistry are known in which teeth were filled with inlays of precious or semiprecious stones. In the last two thousand years mankind’s material knowl - edge has increased so greatly that most of the natural hazards which afflicted the ancient human being have been overcome. No longer do we fear the ghosts and spirits that burdened the lives of the untutored savages of the old world. We have every right to be proud of our achievement, but despite this boasted progress, man still sickens, suffers, and dies. And sad to say, much of his misfortune is the result of superstitions and tradi - tions as senseless and deadly as those which afflicted primitive races. The city is an interesting example of the survival of an an - cient tradition which is no longer significant.

Most ancient towns were walled, and men huddled within these walls to find safety from invading armies and marauding bands of brigands. The inven - tion of artillery ended the age of the walled cities, but habit caused the continuance of the huddling process, even after these towns had proved to be nothing but death-traps for their inhabitants. The walled towns of early days were little more than villages. Great cities were unknown in the ancient world. The large community presented problems which even the clas - sical Greeks, wise in so many arts and sciences, were never able to solve. It remained for the Romans to devise the elaborate system of aqueducts and sewers that made feasible the modern metropolis. Although the great cities of today rise as monuments to hu - man ingenuity, they still are a serious menace to the health of the race. The large community brings with it unhealthful congestion, emphasizes poverty, and is a natural breeding place for crime. The vocations and the avocations, amusements and recreations of the city dweller are artificial. Locked in a man- made world, he has lost contact with the God-made universe. No simple Adamite ever groveled before the grotesque ju- jus of his devil cult with a blinder devotion than that with which the modern man venerates the superstition of wealth. The theory of accumulation has blighted the whole course of our civilization. It has turned every man against his brother, and filled the world with a terrible fear. No longer is it the old blind fear of the unknown, but a new and tangible terror, the sickening realization that survival itself is threatened by human selfishness. Savage men feared the mysterious forces of nature, but civi - lized men fear each other, for they have learned that the human being himself is the most dangerous of all creatures.

The free villages in the Andes Mountains are completely socialized communities. They are entirely untouched by our economic theories and function ac - cording to the old Inca laws. These free villages produce solely for use, and the profit system is unknown in them. The citi - zens cooperate in all undertakings, and there is no poverty and practically no crime. These small mountain villages were un - touched by the great depression of 1929 , for the simple reason that there was no debt. It is usual for the economist to dismiss these socialized com - munities as unimportant, and to insist that it would not be possible to apply such rules to large cities or nations. These ar - guments may be true, but the evidence is conclusive that coop - erative living is the one solution for the economic fear complex that is destroying the health and peace of mind of the so-called civilized races. In an order of living based on a doctrine of debt, nervous ailments are bound to increase. Insecurity is the normal heri - tage, and each man must struggle throughout his days to main - tain some semblance of physical success. There is little time for healthful repose in any family where one serious illness may destroy the economic stability of three generations. It is small wonder that strange and obscure diseases flourish in such an atmosphere. Need it be said that the Divine Power that administrates universal nature is influenced in no way by man’s financial as - pirations. The whole mechanics of accumulation is a human invention, and has no significance outside of the human sphere. If men wish to create little symbols on metal or paper, worship them, and fight, cheat, and kill for them, that is a matter of no interest in the wider vistas of Space.

The principal phobias of the modern man are closely related to the false belief to which he is addicted. Prominent among the popular phobias are: fear of poverty, fear of old age, fear of war, fear of financial failure, fear of sickness, and fear of death. All of these fears are closely related to the financial state. We fear poverty because it threatens the survival of everything that is important to our outward lives; we fear old age because it results in unemployment and consequent dependence; we may fear war for a number of reasons, but one of them is the re - sulting economic upheaval. We fear financial failure as one of the greatest disasters possible to an individual. We fear sickness because it endangers our economic productivity. And we fear death because it may leave our loved ones without adequate provision. All too many of our fears are interpreted in terms of money, and life itself is measured in years of earning power. It is not difficult to understand that the conscious or sub - conscious tension due to constant fear is detrimental to health and life. The result is the great American disease-nerves. A great East Indian scholar, whom I knew in Calcutta, made several pertinent remarks on the subject of nerve tension. He said, in substance: It is impossible for the mental life of man to unfold naturally and normally toward a state of enlightenment unless the physical environment be simplified in every possible way. Creative thought must come from an environment which does not interfere with the sensitive impulses, which flow from the mind through the ethers and into the brain. Confusion, stress, tension, interruption, noise, the constant vibratory agi - tation present in the surroundings of the average Occidental, make it practically impossible for him to think in a manner solutional to his personal problems. When I suggested that this wise old Asiatic should visit America, the kindly gentleman was horrified at the prospect."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Introduction 19 He exclaimed: “But I could not think in America; and if I can - not think, I am dead. To think is to live; and to exist without thinking is to be less than an animal; I will remain where I am, where I can sit quietly under my favorite tree and commune with nature.” Nerves manifest disturbance to their structure and func - tion in a wide variety of ways. The more obvious disorders can be diagnosed with reasonable accuracy, and a number of baf - fling symptoms are summed up under the general term, ner - vous break-down. Unfortunately however, nervous exhaustion and extreme nerve over-stimulation, are quite likely to work out through a series of obscure and extremely complicated men - tal and emotional abnormalities. Once the nerves have been whipped by the tension of their environment, the whole per - sonality loses the power to relax into a normal rhythm of living, and the result is revealed through dispositional peculiarities. Among Western peoples there is a popular belief that a bad disposition is a normal and proper thing to have. Excitability, irritability, and violent outbursts of temper are summed up un - der the term, temperament. It seldom occurs to a person suf - fering from temperament that there is anything that he can do to correct his own faults. Person, who have come to me for help become aghast at the prospect of attempting to practice self-control. When told that a bad temper is the cause of the trouble, they will invariably answer, “I know I shouldn’t have such spells, but I can’t help it.” Disposition of course reacts strongly into the body, disor - dering its functions and even attacking the structure itself. It is impossible for any person to escape the consequences of his own attitudes, as these attitudes affect his bodily harmony. In early life, the human being is sustained by a powerful reserve of physical energy. This is especially evident in chil - dren, who are never still and bubble-over with an apparently"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"20 Healing, the Divine Art inexhaustible supply of vitality. Mental and emotional hab - its acquired in youth are not usually obvious in their conse - quences until after middle life. Gradually, as the supply of vital force diminishes, the body begins to exhibit the rewards of the various mental and emotional intemperance with which it has been afflicted. Chronic dispositional tendencies result in chronic physi - cal ailments. The peculiarities of disposition, as we nurse them through the years, set in upon us as bodily ailments, afflicting our later years with innumerable misfortunes which destroy our happiness and peace of mind. Nowhere throughout nature is the working of the law of cause and effect more evident than in problems of physical health. Take cancer for example. I have been able to assemble a large number of case histories which indicate that cancer is a grief disease. It is most likely to arise in the individual who has locked his disappointments, sorrows, and hurts within himself. Grief eats up the normal optimism of human nature, produc - ing in the consciousness a condition identical with that which cancer sets up in the body. As women are more likely to nourish in silence the grieving of their hearts, the ailment is particularly prevalent among them. In three cases that I know of, a deep self-censoring remorse was followed within a year by cancer of the breast, and in each case history no cancer was known in the heredity. Diabetes, in my experience, is often associated with a hyp - ocritical reaction to the circumstances of life. The individual who demands of others a degree of perfection totally absent within himself, and then builds up from his disappointments a negative and cynical disposition, is an easy victim of both diabetes and chronic kidney trouble. Rheumatism and arthritis are present in personalities in - capable of adjusting to change. Several cases are known to me"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Introduction 21 in which severe attacks of these diseases have been quickly im - proved by releasing the mind from the tension of trying to pre - serve a status quo in an ever changing world. An old lady whom lance knew was resolved to maintain her mid-Victorian traditions in the twentieth century. As late as 1920 this quaint character refused to ride in street cars, would have neither electric lights nor a telephone, and dressed in the fashion of 1870 . She would have no part in that motion of prog - ress which she was convinced was leading the world directly to perdition. The orthodoxy of her religious viewpoints was unas - sailable, and she crept about town suffering with rheumatics in every joint. At last through a series of curious circumstances this old lady was rejuvenated. Near her 80th year she gave up the fight to preserve the old way of life, and blossomed forth with a pro - gressiveness of spirit that startled the entire community. Six months later the rheumatism was gone, and she enjoyed the best of health until her 94 th year. Chronic stomach trouble is most frequently found among the worriers and those whose delicate egos are easily bruised. Nervous stomach trouble is a difficult ailment to bear grace - fully, but if the mind can be directed to become less critical of others, more tolerant in its viewpoints, the digestion will im - mediately show a marked improvement. While all sickness cannot be traced to disposition, it can be said with accuracy that all persons with bad dispositions are sick. A bad disposition is one of the heaviest burdens that the flesh can bear. Our nervous folk often build up destructive tension around the simplest processes of their living. This tension distorts and deforms otherwise useful and noble beliefs and convictions. Religion, for example, must be approached with a normal op - timist’s attitude, or the believer soon finds himself in serious trouble. Most of the fanaticism, bigotry, and narrow-minded -"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"22 Healing, the Divine Art ness, so obvious among those addicted to religious convictions, are the result of nerve tension manifesting in the sphere of spiri - tual beliefs. Religion is extremely dangerous for the neurotic, for it will set their neurosis in a peculiarly disastrous channel. Yet, it is the neurotic who is most likely to seek consolation in religion. It is an old philosophical truth that the human being must bring normalcy to any subject which he wishes to consider, or he will fail in that subject. In our Western theory of educa - tion we have overlooked the part that the individual himself plays in the arts or sciences which he is studying. For example, medicine is more than a science; it is a way of living; and only the man who lives according to the philosophy of medicine can become a great doctor. Music is not merely a technique; a musicologist, one who is experienced in the whole theory of music, must live the life of music to gain the full benefit of musical education. We cannot bring an old way of life to a new art without destroying that art by the limitations of our own consciousness. Of all the arts and sciences, life itself is the greatest and most profound. It takes many years to train a physician, or a lawyer, in the particulars of his profession; but it requires many lives of experience and thoughtfulness to bring a human being into the fullness of his own humanity. In order to be a success - ful human being, a man must study the laws which govern his development, and then apply those laws to every aspect of his living. Only when a man lives intelligently, simply, efficiently, and with gentleness of spirit can he be mentally wise, emotion - ally happy, or physically healthy. To the degree that he compro - mises truth, to that degree he will be sick. Philosophy, there - fore, is preventive medicine. Philosophy teaches thus of health, and how it can be pre - served, and if lost, how it can be regained."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Introduction 23 The beginning of health is the discovery of the gods. Our personal living is based upon our conviction concerning the nature of Eternal Being. When we can perceive behind visible nature a Universal Principle of good accomplishing all things through wisdom, strength, and beauty, we free our minds from those several doubts concerning providence. These inwardly discovered certainties bestow the courage necessary for right action, thus establishing the mind in harmony and peace. The second necessary element in a normal philosophy of life is the realization of the eternity of the self, and the understand - ing of the great law of evolution through which all lives are growing up toward perfection. There must be a sense of par - ticipation in the growth and unfoldment everywhere visible in nature. The purpose of life is growth. And a man is successful to the degree that he develops character in harmony with the laws of the world of which he is a part. The third consideration involves the sharing of what we are, and what we have, with others of our kind. Cooperation, friendship, and the constructive emotions which bring human beings into a closer concord are important as elements in a phi - losophy of health. The last consideration is that of leisure; haste and stress must be eliminated from the technique of living. The civilized human being is one who has discovered the dignity of leisure, and it is this discovery which made the Greeks, Hin - dus, and Chinese great in philosophy, art, and literature. There must be time, rescued from less important pursuits, to be devoted to the culturing of the self. It is this freedom from tension that brings with it non-resistance to ideas, and those seasons of contemplation which are a part of true maturity.

He is thus entitled to our respect, and our worthy purpose of seeking a better understanding of his methods, his place, and his position in the advancing march of civilization. It is a mistake to assume that our remote and savage an - cestors enjoyed the boon of good health. The aborigine lived a hazardous and afflicted existence. All about him were huge animals whose strength vastly exceeded his own, and smaller reptiles and insects whose cunning he could not match. The anthropological Adamite man who was to become so great in"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28 Healing, the Divine Art his latter times was the weakling of the prehistoric world, with little to be thankful for, and not much to be thankful with. He was entirely without knowledge of the natural causes of disease. No reasonable connection had been established be - tween his mode of living and the condition of his health. And so, to him, all sickness was of supernatural origin. He could see that the good and the bad were stricken together, the old and the young knew the same pain, the rich and the poor wasted away side by side. He did not know why. Out of this deep unknowing, fear was born. It was fear of everything, of everyone; fear of the great animals which roared in the jungles; fear of the little shining things that buzzed in the swamps; fear of the thunder that rumbled in the sky, and the lightning that filled the heavens with greenish fire; fear of floods and of droughts; fear of earthquakes and tidal waves. Most of all, fear of darkness, that strange and fatal gloom that covered the earth for a part of every day. Night had a thousand terrors for shivering creatures hud - dled in their caves and huts through the long hours of darkness. Outside were strange sounds; and if one of the bravest went forth to seek the origin of the sounds he returned no more. In the morning the others found him, dead, and usually partly de - voured. Darkness was filled with life that struck and destroyed, that slunk on padded feet, and had green eyes that shone in the darkness; it was life that barked, and grunted, and whined, and hissed, life ever waiting, always to do harm. Fear, oldest and cruelest of man’s emotions, heartless and senseless in itself, is the source of endless pain and misery. In a fear-ruled savage world, courage was but an instant of resis - tance followed by disaster. The more men fought against the unknown the greater was their fear, for nature opposed each time became more terrible than before. The venturesome and courageous crept back to their dens like whipped curs, to pon - der with untutored minds the misfortunes of their state."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Beginnings of Metaphysical Healing 29 T h e f i R s T P R i e s T - P h y s i c i a n - P s y c h o l o g i s T Out of this old, dark night of the mind which preceded the dawn of reason came the Witch Doctor. We have no record of the origin or of the processes that produced this fantastic hierophant of the earth’s first healing cults; the first priest, the first physician, and the first psychologist. If to our more sophis - ticated minds the Witch Doctor was a horrible monstrosity, he was to the savage world that produced him the beginning of hope, the first of the long line of adventurers who have dared to shape inevitables to meet the human need. Many scholars, who have deeply pondered old peoples and their lore, have tried to explain the Witch Doctor; of these the psychologists appear to be the most successful, for they have rec - ognized their distant kinship with him and with his methods. But psychology opens only on a small part of the broad vista of philosophy, and a better look at the Witch Doctor can be had from philosophy’s wider perspective; its viewpoint should enable us to discern more clearly the forces that fashioned him, the larger motions that directed his course. The physical origin of religion, to my mind, is the veneration for age. Those who have lived long have experienced the most. Tradition is the record of the long-lived. Not many reached to great age in primitive times and among savage peoples; there were too many hazards in the way; so most of the races re - spected the old, and accorded them dignities and honors equal with the gods and spirits. For, in the first state of human so - ciety, those who reached fullness of years excelled in simple thoughtfulness-the survivor was the superior man. The savage has never been one to preserve the useless. It was not love for his fellow-kind that induced him to feed and protect the old warriors who could no longer provide for them - selves; the considerations were entirely utilitarian. These old men knew the ways of the jungle and the hill. They had been to"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 Healing, the Divine Art far places, they had hunted the forests and crossed the rivers on floating logs. They had known heroes of previous generations, and they were the custodians of words of wisdom spoken by men long dead. In the beginning man honored only strength of arm, but slowly this changed. Another kind of strength had proved that it might save the tribe when valor failed; this other strength was wisdom. And wisdom belonged to the old ones who had lived long. The hereditary chief, young and in the fullness of his powers, honored for his strength, had behind him the old ones, venerated for their wisdom; and it was of greatest benefit for the young chieftain to consult with them and profit by their counsel. Thus came into being the dual form of government that existed throughout antiquity; it came to full flowering in the Egyptian culture-the government of the priest and king. Thus had the fathers become the priests by long and myste - rious processes of veneration and tradition—as even today, it IS the custom of the Catholic to call his priest “Father.” And the word Pope, from the Greek papas, literally means Father. It is well known to psychology that the small child bestows upon its parents-if they do not disillusion it too young—the same veneration that the child will transfer later to its concept of God. Father is God, and God is Father. How many parents realize that when their small boy bumps his knee and comes running to them for sympathy and help, he is expressing the primary religious instinct of mankind? In later life, when tragedies disturb the soul, the afflicted person takes his pain to God through the ritual of prayer, with the firm belief that he will find comfort and strength. Primitive man had no way to perpetuate his knowledge and the records of his deeds except by oral tradition. In time he learned to draw crude pictures on the walls of cliffs; but long before that the Witch Doctor was an institution. Likenesses of"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Beginnings of Metaphysical Healing 31 him, variously garbed in the skins of animals, are included in the earliest form of art. c a n d i d a T e s f R o m T h e s e l e c T e d n e u R o T i c Always, men have wanted to be remembered and have their deeds to live on after them. So the old ones, when they felt that they had not much longer to live, sought for others that they could instruct in their lore and history. Thus it came about that the neurotic became the savior of his tribe, later, of his race. The old men, seeking suitable disciples, turned to the quiet and more thoughtful youths, because their minds were better suited to the perpetuation of tradition than the lustier and more bel - ligerent types. Having discovered someone to his liking, the old man then devoted his closing years to the task of transfer - ring his knowledge, and with it, of course, an ample descrip - tion of his own personal exploits. When the old teacher joined the ghosts of his fathers, the young disciple was, so to speak, ordained to carry on his wisdom, and probably in the name of the older man rather than in his own. A new condition now presented itself. Veneration was no longer merely a respect for years, it was directed to a person of any age who had the knowledge of the “ olds .” But just as in modern time it is impossible to divide learning entirely apart from the personalities of the learned, so did the younger men then share in the respect accorded to their knowledge. This was the next step in the development of the priesthood, when the ones who knew received special privileges. They sat with the warriors when matters of importance were discussed, these wise men who were too valuable to be exposed in battle and whose pursuits did not equip them for warlike exploits. They wore various distinguishing marks and badges. Their advice was sought in all things pertaining to the happiness and security of"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32 Healing, the Divine Art the tribe. It was inevitable that sickness should be brought to the consideration of the wise ones; for there was no other direc - tion in which the sufferer could turn. From the wise ones the sick learned of the experiences of their ancestors under similar conditions. Whatever means had helped in the past were repeated, and faith in the old ways un - doubtedly brought a measure of relief. Memory kept such re - cords as it could, and being a faculty closely linked to imagina - tion, these records grew and flourished in many curious ways. Metaphysical elements were most certainly present in this old pattern, for the psychic sensitiveness of primitive people is established beyond intelligent dispute. The savage is very close to nature, and close to the animal life about him, and most ani - mals possess a higher development of instinct than does man; instinct may have been the beginning of mysticism. And it is not at all impossible that some of the “ olds ” were natural spir - itists and had a crude form of mystic vision. Then at some very remote time it was discovered that this sensitiveness could be increased by fasting and vigils that ex - hausted the physical strength. Those who have lived the longest close to savage tribes are the most convinced that not all the powers of the Witch Doctor are psychological or imaginary. T R a n c e s a n d d R e a m c o n s c i o u s n e s s Dreams probably played an important part in the devel - opment of the aboriginal mystic. The mysteries of the dream life never have been fully explained, but it is well known that a person is most likely to dream about those things that are uppermost in his mind. It is thus quite possible that the tribal prophets were visited in their dreams by the “ olds ” who had been their teachers. If these dead did not actually appear, they could seem to come in dream consciousness, thus linking the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Beginnings of Metaphysical Healing 33 past with the present through the mystery of sleep. Trances are but artificial sleep, induced by drugs, suggestion, or autosug - gestion; and their avowed purpose is to give easier access to the dream state and its phenomena. Here then, are all the elements necessary to produce the Witch Doctor. Time perfected the process. Fainter and fainter in the dis - tance of untrained memory grew the “aids”; they became the great spirits who had lived in the long ago, who now dwelt in some strange ghostland where the seer could seek them in his dreams and trances. The lore of the tribe thus became its reli - gion, and the faith was as cruel and primitive as its believers. It is impossible to understand the Witch Doctor in the terms of our present standards of right and wrong. He was part of his world as we are part of ours, and they are two worlds that have little in common. In sleep we come closer to the old one, but even our dreams have been largely conditioned by our conscious thinking. We cannot know the Witch Doctor, but let us at least re - spect him—in the deep realization that without his strange powers modern civilization could not be as it is. We cannot appreciate his healing methods, without under - standing the religion of the Witch Doctor. In its theological aspect, a religion is an attitude toward life, a series of beliefs and conclusions bearing upon the relationship of the individual to the spiritual world and its creatures. On the moral, or ethical side, religion is the rule of conduct—things that can be done, and things that cannot be done. In primitive society those ac - tions which violated the tribal law were punished in proportion to the magnitude of the offense. And so we can readily un - derstand that the first religious ethics were mostly taboos, and only after thousands of years of refinement was ethics evolved into the dignified standards of today."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 Healing, the Divine Art d i s e a s e a s a s P i R i T u a l m y s T e R y In the beginning, religion was little more than organized fear. Gradually, certain distinctive practices began to appear, bearing witness to specialized attitudes and convictions. Savage theology had this basis: All that is invisible to the untrained eye or is beyond the understanding of the untrained mind is super - natural. Disease, therefore, was a spiritual mystery, one to be approached only by those who had power over spirits and their evil force. So far as we know, these were the tribal convictions as they applied to sickness and disease: Disease itself is a spirit, without form or body, existing in •\t the air and attaching itself to man with or without cause. This spirit, at will, may take on any number of appearances, •\t and may attack man in any of these forms, animate or in - animate. A person possessing magical knowledge, or some powerful •\t fetish, may direct the spirit of disease against his enemies to destroy them. Disease may be caused by angry spirits, either of the human •\t dead, or of animals, or of plants; even of minerals. Any indignity or neglect to the tribal dead may cause their •\t spirits to send sickness or other misfortunes. Animals killed for food may cause disease unless proper cer - •\t emonies are performed at the time of killing. Whether possessing, or not possessing, special occult pow - •\t ers, evil persons may communicate disease by a glance (evil eye), or by touching some article belonging to the victim. The Witch Doctor himself may cause sickness to anyone •\t doubting his powers or resisting his authority."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Beginnings of Metaphysical Healing 35 It is to be noted that no mention has been made of gods as causes of physical misfortunes. This is because in those remote times there was no clear concept of superior deities, nor was there the conception of disease as retribution for sin. The near - est approach was the fear of offending powerful spirits; but no ethical motives were imputed to the spirits, and ethics had little to do with appeasing their wrath. Some writers refer to the practices of the Witch Doctors as Black Magic. This is incorrect; for there can be no perver - sion of power so long as no standard of right exists. Witchcraft became a negative and perverse force as civilization developed standards of integrity which it violates. The term Witch Doctor therefore is incorrectly interpreted as one inferring evil; it ap - plies only to a savage, or primitive magician. Masks always played an important part in the Witch Doc - tor’s rites. What was the origin of these weird masks? I believe they were originally the likenesses of the “ olds .” Most of these masks are to us grotesque and horrible, but the strange designs were probably things of beauty and dignity to the primitive men who made them, and full of subtle meaning. T h e P R e s T i g e i n m a s k s In the mask cults it was believed that to put on the mask was to take upon oneself the spirit which the mask represented. If then, the Witch Doctor put on the faa of the “ old ” he became the embodiment of the “ old ,” spoke with his voice, and pos - sessed his authority. The animal heads worn by the Egyptian priests had the same meaning, and may have originated in totemism—the priest wearing the mask of his spirit-animal. The fear produced by the mask may also have played an im - portant part in this ancient religious custom. The Witch Doctor increased his prestige immensely by changing his appearance"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"36 Healing, the Divine Art into something unearthly. The natives knew of course that a mask was used, but still it produced considerable emotional re - action. Years ago, at Darjeeling in Northern India, a number of Devil Dancers wandered up to our hotel to stage a perfor - mance. Among them was a little boy, about eight years of age, who soon became the darling of the resident tourists. In the evening when the dance was given, all of the performers, in - cluding the youngster, were masked to represent Tibetan de - mons. In the midst of the dance the young boy, wearing the papier-mache head of a bull, rushed toward the crowd, which broke and ran with cries of alarm. All knew the boy, and many of them had been feeding him candy during the afternoon, but in the scramble the educated whites outran the natives. It was primordial logic to suppose that if the mask fright - ened mortals it would have a similar effect upon evil spirits. These, terrified by the awesome spectacle, would depart in haste and remove their evil forces from the village. This belief is at the root of some of the Tibetan ceremonies, and is recorded in many accounts of Witch Doctors and their methods. The sav - age saw no reason to suppose that spirits were any more intel - ligent than himself; what frightened him should also frighten ghosts. There is also a deeper psychological meaning to masks. Their designs come out of the unconscious , or deeply subconscious parts of the human intellect. Possibly the designs were brought over from dream life and are evidences of strange impulses locked in the further recesses of the mind. The religious art of savage peoples has a dramatic integrity that should give the psycholo - gist much to think about. The mask was an escape from self. The wearer became someone else, and in many ways lived another life, with all the implications of such new identity. In some American Indian tribes persons who have suffered from a long series of misfortunes change their names to escape"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Beginnings of Metaphysical Healing 37 further misery. A new name means a new personality, the In - dian becomes someone else; and the spirits who disliked the previous name will have no cause to plague the new one. Any stage or screen actor who uses make-up will under - stand this psychology. When costumed and be-whiskered to look like King Lear, he should feel like King Lear; and if he does not, he is a poor actor. If then, some crepe hair and a little grease paint can make a man feel like Lord Beaconsfield, why can not the mask of a superhuman make the wearer feel a little more like that superhuman being?—in fact make that spirit seem very close and real. Analytical research should be done in this direction; it is a most provocative subject. Various types of noise-makers have always been part of the Witch Doctor’s paraphernalia. His rattle, another means of frightening spirits, or of commanding their attention, also aroused the sick person, made him aware of the presence of the magician, thus focusing his mind on the treatment he was receiving—a process important in what is called suggestive therapy, or healing by suggestion. Many of these rattles were ornamented with symbols resembling streaks of lightning; in this is a possible indication that the sounds they made were intended to represent thunder. The savage is always profoundly impressed by loud sounds, and to his sensitive ears the noise is much louder than it would seem to us. An experiment made a few years ago proved that a certain American Indian could hear the ticking of a watch in a man’s pocket more than fifty feet away. Drums, flutes, and other primitive instruments also served the Witch Doctor in his rituals. Different tribes evolved their own special practices, but in principle all were the same. The antiquity of the Witch Doctor is registered in the universal dis - tribution of his methods. There are no primitive peoples in the world today among which he does not flourish, and there is no civilized race whose spiritual culture does not bear witness to"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"38 Healing, the Divine Art his original presence. It is more than a possibility that both mu - sic and the dance began with him, used as means of frightening away evil spirits, or conjuring up benevolent ghosts. Music began in the mimicking of natural sounds, such as the cries of animals and the songs of birds. After the Witch Doctor had put on the mask of some creature, it was part of the procedure that he should imitate the sounds made by that crea - ture. The endless repetition of similar tones and notes resulted in simple rhythms. At some parts of his ceremonies the magi - cian needed greater emphasis, and in the midst of his chanting he would agitate his rattle or beat his drum; and thus was ac - companiment born. As time passed the various medicine songs were more or less standardized, and musical composition thus came into existence, its form and rhythm fixed by tradition. Placement keys resulted from the natural differences in human voices, and the various pitches of primitive instruments. As late as the Greeks, each member of a chorus sang according to the comfort of his own voice; harmonics was unknown until the time of Pythagoras. From the earliest available records it appears that the dance had its genesis in the efforts of the Witch Doctor to imitate the motions of the creatures whose faces he wore. When he wore the mask of an elephant some inner force impelled him to as - sume the manner of an elephant, and his step was slow and dignified. But if his mask was that of a bird he hopped about and tried to give the impression of flying. Then the wild aban - don of his first efforts was gradually modified by the rhythms of his rattle and drum; he preserved the basic motions of the creatures he represented but he brought them within the limits of his other rituals. Gradually the gyrations became symbolical rather than literal. The dance forms, like the songs which usu - ally accompanied them, then became traditional. The dance has always been part of religion, first as a magical rite, and later as pageantry and aesthetic ritual."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Beginnings of Metaphysical Healing 39 The theatre also began with the Witch Doctor; as sacred drama it continued until the collapse of classical civilization. It was later revived in the medieval mystery plays of the Catholic Church, which are still to be seen in isolated regions. The Peni - tentes of New Mexico include to this day sacred representations from the life drama of the Christ among their strange rites. When the Witch Doctor lived out the personalities of his masks he became an actor, and as he gained ever greater skill in pantomime and impersonation, there was a corresponding increase in the psychological results from his treatments. Much of his early acting was while in a state of ecstasy or light trance, and so we know that his theatrics were from his own subcon - scious nature. In the Egyptian and Greek Mystery rituals the actors were always masked, and those portraying gods were generally ac - cepted as the divinities themselves. When ancient writers stated that they had spoken to certain gods it generally meant that they had spoken to priests wearing the masks of those gods. This was not imposture on the part of the priests, as many moderns have assumed. The masks were known to be covering a human face, but it was an old belief that the gods abode in the likenesses of themselves. In this we find the true explanation of idols and sacred images. e a R l y m e d i c a T i o n b y f e T i s h e s a n d h e R b s The fetish was the beginning of formal medicine; it was the first compound used in the treatment of disease. A fetish may be defined as any material object in which a spirit, or a spiritual power is present. The fetish was some natural substance which by its appearance, or peculiar properties, appeared unusual, or it was bone, stone, or wood crudely carved into the likeness of some creature, or some ceremonial object or sacred relic. Most frequently a fetish is composed of several magical or non-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"40 Healing, the Divine Art magical elements, as pebbles, feathers, hairs, bones, twigs and beads, and has special virtue because of certain rites performed in the assembling of the parts, or because the particular pat - tern composed has traditional sanctity. Commonly the fetish is either worn on the person, or placed in the living quarters as a protection against malignant forces. Fetishes made from small objects and from herbs were sometimes swallowed; they were even inserted under the skin to increase their efficacy. This is probably the earliest form of medication. Herbs were originally used as fetishes only, but as time passed they were chewed, or they were boiled and the brew drunk, not for the sake of its chemical action but in order that its ‘spirit’ might thus be captured and held. Through trial and error it was gradually discovered that certain of these plants were more effective than others, and some ailments responded to one herb and some to another, thus a pharmacology was built up. Magic was the motive, medicine was the result. The evolution of fetishes is an interesting phase of the his - tory of magical practices. As nations refined their beliefs the fetish gradually changed into the amulet. Among the Egyp - tians there was a wide variety of amulets-small figures of gods, goddesses, and sacred symbols, cut from stone or molded from clay baked and glazed. These figures were pierced, so that they could be hung about the neck on a cord. So great is the number of these little charms found in the ruins of Egyptian towns that they must have been worn in profusion, man y by a single person. The amulet was a charm of protection against various evils; the theory of its use was that any spirit or witch that attacked the wearer would be confronted by the likeness and power of a protecting deity. The crucifix worn by many Christians is either a symbol or an amulet, according to the motive of the wearer. If he believes that the symbol protects him in any way, the cross becomes an amulet."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Beginnings of Metaphysical Healing 41 The amulet evolved into the talisman. This is a magical charm decorated with cabalistic formulas or mystical designs calculated to protect the owner against physical or metaphysi - cal hazards. It is usually of metal-silver preferred. Talismans of one class, shaped to resemble parts and organs of the body, were worn to ensure, or to restore health in the parts which they represented. Such talismans were sometimes hung in the temples or churches, as votive offerings or as appeals for help. In Asian countries, especially, will be found a third type of talisman. These are small cases containing prayers or extracts from the sacred writings, and are worn by holy men, or those making pilgrimages to important shrines. Also among Islamic peoples are many talismanic jewels, beautifully inscribed. A small charm in the shape of an open hand is a favorite among the Arabic nations; it represents the hand of Fatima, daughter of Mohammed. It may be well to note that in considerable volume charms are manufactured for use in trading with savage tribes. These fetishes include most of the desired types, those popular in different districts, and all are made according to the best na - tive specifications. These charms are made in England for use throughout the colonial empire, and the traveler should remem - ber this when he is searching for aboriginal religious trinkets. It is quite likely his rare old juju from West Africa originated in London. o R i g i n o f T h e R e l i c It is only a short step from the talisman to the holy relic. This important object in modern religious practice also had its origin in the world of the Witch Doctor. When the savage slew an exceptionally powerful animal, or killed a renowned warrior in battle, he would keep some part of the body of the vanquished, that he might in this way gain strength from its spirit."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"42 Healing, the Divine Art Frequently the Witch Doctor’s magical instruments were formed from human or animal bones. Bowls and drums made from human skulls are to be seen on Tibetan altars, and deco - rations of bones adorn the fronts of the Witch Doctors’ huts. Buddhism makes much of relics, and the tooth of Bud - dha in Calcutta is the object of annual celebrations. (A parade through the streets to the temple of the Sacred Tooth was once held for my benefit). Most Buddhist shrines have been built over remains of great arhats, and small reliquaries containing bits of bone or the ashes of some saint are carried about by both the priest and the laity. As in the Christian faith, these relics are believed to have the power to cure disease and bestow sanctity. When European kings grew weary of bestowing the ‘Roy - al Touch’ for scrofula, these thoughtful princes devised the scheme of coining touchpieces to accomplish the cures. These golden coins are a combination of talisman and relic: their magical powers were talismanic, but they were relics by asso - ciation with the king who could heal by ‘Divine Right.’ These touchpieces are still occasionally met with in Scotland, where they are regarded as excellent remedies for some ailments, espe - cially those of the skin.

Witchcraft is the survival of the old dark magic of Lemuria. Wherever in the world the black people are to be found, the shadow of the Witch Doctor hangs over them, and his wild spirit is in their blood. Witchcraft, as practiced by savage races, is not a perversion of mystical doctrines, as most persons think. It is the way that was old long before men had recognized and differentiated between good and bad. As some cultures grew more rapidly than others and refined their beliefs, it became the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Beginnings of Metaphysical Healing 43 custom to regard primitive beliefs as evil. If this is sound theolo - gy, it is not a very enlightened attitude to assume that the priest of any cult other than your own is the servant of the devil. Believing that disease was a spirit wandering about in the nights seeking for something to afflict, the Witch Doctor was faced with a delicate problem when he forced such a spirit out of his patient. If the spirit was left without habitation it might reasonably resent its condition, attack the entire village, destroy the inhabitants and their flocks. So the spirit had to be kept happy, even when deprived of its victim. There was only one way: it had to be coaxed into finding a new abode, one as de - sirable as possible. An old method was to select a scapegoat and sacrifice him for the good of the whole tribe. All sacrifices were originally made to appease the wrath of spirits and ghosts. Another way was to capture the spirit in some fetish and leave the charm where another would find it, and thus become the victim of the spirit’s desire for lodgings. This might not seem exactly ethical, but self-preservation was the law of the wilds; so whoever found the fetish had to find his own way to get rid of the unwelcome guest. The reputed power of the Witch Doctor to assume the forms of various animals and birds probably originated from his use of masks and costumes. This belief spread to every corner of the earth, in universal acceptance of were-wolves, were-tigers, were- bats, and were-owls. The form assumed by the Witch Doctor was determined by the local attitude toward animals and the fauna of the vicinity, but the principle remained the same. Lycanthropy is folklore associated with the name of Lycaon, mythical king of Arcadia, who was changed into a wolf by Zeus who was offended because the king made him an offering of human flesh. In many myths persons are changed into animals as punishment for evil deeds, but in most cases these merely signify that the animal nature dominates vicious persons and they become human beasts. Accounts of lycanthropy do not"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"44 Healing, the Divine Art imply that the physical body of the wizard or witch changed into a wolf, but rather that the soul or ‘double’ of the sorcerer assumed the appearance of the wolf. A story reached me recently about a were-owl in one of the American Government Indian Schools some few years back. The story is vouched for by a participant in the incident. Sev - eral boys were sleeping on an enclosed screen porch when they were awakened by a screech-owl that in some way had gotten through the screen. The boys immediately decided that it was a were-owl, and attacked it with shoes and sticks-finally kill - ing it. The Indian boys then dressed and took the bird into the forest nearby, and then traveled some three miles to the house of the suspected witch. As they approached they heard the old woman howling and crying out as if in great pain. They threw the dead owl on her front steps and returned to the school. The next day they learned that the old woman was dead. All agreed they had killed a witch. When witches planned to go to the Sabbat, become were - wolves, or vampires, or to travel to distant places, they threw themselves into trances or comas and went forth in spirit bodies or doubles. If they were injured in this magical body the physi - cal form suffered the same misfortune. Here is an indication that at least one phase of the witchcraft doctrine belongs to the phenomena of the subconscious mind. If research in thought transference fulfills the present expectancy, it is possible that the mental purposes of the sorcerer might be felt by the in - tended victim; and he might see, in his dreams, the form which the witch had desired to assume. u n e x P l a i n a b l e m o d e R n w i T c h c R a f T The mental effect of believing oneself bewitched is demor - alizing to persons who are not ordinarily superstitious.

The human mind is very sensitive to phobias and fixations, even when the beliefs are against ev - ery conviction of the conscious intellect. Many times, men and women have emphatically stated to me that they did not believe in witchcraft; then added that it is just as well to leave it alone, and not stir up mysterious things. A planter returning from Java told me that to excite the animosity of the natives was a serious misfortune. When these people are angered strange things happen which cannot be ex - plained by any knowledge that we have today. He told me how the family of one plantation owner was tormented into leaving the island-a stream of mud and filth fell in the various rooms of the house; it seemed to come through the ceiling, in showers of refuse that plagued them for months. Much witch lore is susceptible of reasonable explanation and has no foundation in the practices of the Witch Doctor. The celebrated Brocken, the mountain of the witches in the Black Forest of Germany, was a figment of ecclesiastical imagi - nation and fanaticism. The Bracken, regarded as the site of the infernal Sabbat, was really a place where the old pagans kept up their pre-Christian rites long after the rise of the Church. As all the old Mysteries were institutions of Satan, according to the Fathers, it did not take long for their pronouncements to infect the public mind. The result was a belief in sorcery that is without parallel in history. Thus we see that from the jungle hut of the savage’s Witch Doctor together came forth sciences and superstitions, arts and artifices, spirits and sprites, ghosts and goblins, faiths and fe - tishes. Like the fabulous Banyan tree of India, whose branches fell to earth and taking root became trees in their turn, the primitive magic of the Witch Doctor extended itself through - out the world. Most of the respected beliefs of modern times are but a refinement of his old doctrines. It would seem that we also owe to this jungle sorcerer the discovery and first use"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46 Healing, the Divine Art of intoxicating beverages, when he found that certain herbs af - fected his mind and made easier the trances that he needed in his ministry. The Egyptians believed that the blood of ancient warriors fell into the earth and was absorbed by the roots of the grape; to them drunkenness was possession by the spirits battling in the veins of the drinker, as they once had in life. Even into clas - sical times wine was regarded as the blood of Dionysus, and the frenzies which it caused were sacred to the rites of that god. The use of wine in modern sacraments is the direct descent of a rite from the Dionysian Mysteries of Greece. d o c T o R s a s T h e f i R s T a d m i n i s T R a T o R s o f l a w In the beginning of his power the Witch Doctor used his knowledge largely for the preservation of his tribe, so as time went on it became also his duty to punish those who violated the taboos. He was therefore the first administrator of the law. Tribal organization demanded complete obedience to the tra - ditions, the ways of the “ olds .’ To disobey was to depart from the tribe. If the violation was slight, it might be punished in some lesser way; but if the fault was of large import, death was the penalty. Somewhere in this mystery conscience was born. The inner- voice warning to obey was coupled to fear of the consequences of departure from the hereditary laws. The supernatural powers attributed to the Witch Doctor played an important part in the development of conscience, for it was believed that he could tell the thoughts of men and the schemes in their hearts. In The Emperor Jones , the play by Eugene O’Neil, the wrongdoers punish themselves by their own sense of guilt; in long ago times the Witch Doctor gained the credit. We know conscience as a kind of fear that will defeat a man even if he is immune to other forms of punishment. Conscience was the first-born of taboos."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Beginnings of Metaphysical Healing 47 Somewhere in the long ago the Witch Doctor came to re - alize the fuller possibilities that his position offered. Because there was no evidence of honesty in the universe about him, no incentive or example to direct the course of magical arts, he was tempted to use his mystical powers for his own gain. It was natural that the sorcerer should exploit the fear and respect in which he was held, and thus make himself master not only over the spirits of his people, but their bodies as well. Whatever wealth the tribesmen had, finally came to him in payment for his numerous services. The Witch Doctor seldom aspired to be a chief; he was content to rule the rulers. That gave him added protection for himself. And in the natural course of things he was inevita - bly inspired to ‘make friends and influence people: Because he could, and did, curse his enemies, make spells to bewitch them, transfer disease to them, these were ways to so intimidate the poor savages that they were afraid to refuse any of the magi - cian’s wishes. This development complicated the practice of the reputable Witch Doctor, and vastly increased the prestige of the unscru - pulous practitioner. It was now necessary to fight one spell with another, and the primordial man through most of his life was either bewitched or under treatment. The Witch Doctors had many an occult battle among themselves, viewing with one another to concoct infernal brews and diabolic enchantments. This was the beginning of those strange, evil practices that were to chill the hearts of Europeans for more than fifteen hundred years when the witch cult was revived in the opening centuries of the Christian era. In Africa, the missionary and the Witch Doctor are still struggling for control over the soul of the Dark Continent. A converted native appeared for help recently at one of the mis - sion stations.

They were representa - tives of a faith that has long taught miracles, and the casting out of devils; but these well meaning men lacked the power to perform even one small miracle that would benefit this afflicted family. T h e u s e a n d a b u s e o f m a g i c Some degree of primitive ethics is nearly everywhere pres - ent in the forms of witchcraft that exist in our world of today. Perversions of magical powers are regarded with general disap - proval, even by remote African tribes, and hatred for the Witch Doctor suspected of evil practices is now quite common, even among his own followers, for the processes of growth are at work everywhere in nature, and in human nature. The Vodun, or Voodoo, rites of Haiti abound in witchcraft and wizardry, being of African origin. But a clear line is drawn between the use and abuse of magic. The Houngan is the won - der-working priest of the Vodun cult; the Bocor is the wizard or sorcerer. In his recent work, The Haitian People, James G. Leyburn writes: “A respectable houngan will not permit him - self to dabble in evil magic, destined to bring misfortune to someone else; but such work is the stock in trade of the bocor, who knows the dangers of his profession yet is willing to run the risk for the sake of high profit.” d e v i l d o l l s One of the most common forms of Black Magic, based on old beliefs, are the ‘devil dolls.’ These are small images of a person, carved from wood, or merely made by stuffing cloth"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Beginnings of Metaphysical Healing 49 with straw or sawdust and drawing the face of the victim on the knob representing the head. I have had opportunities to ex - amine a number of these dolls, and in a few cases photographs of the person against whom they were to be used had been cut out and pasted on the doll. This practice is founded in the belief about masks and idols, that the victim is attached to the doll by the sympathetic magic of likeness. But to further assure the effectiveness of the ‘devil dolls’ it is customary to include in their assembly something that has belonged to the object of the intended sorcery. A strand of hair or fingernail parings are first choice, but a bit of clothing or a piece of a shoe will do. Thus is the living victim further bound to the doll by the psychic ef - fluvium remaining in bits of his personal belongings. With the doll completed, certain rites were performed over it, the magical powers of nature invoked to aid in the evil work. Then the doll was variously tortured; pins were stuck into it, cuts were made in the arms and legs, red-hot irons were put against its body, and at last a knife or pin was thrust through the region of the heart. According to magic, the victim, regard - less of distance, suffered all the pains that were inflicted on the doll, and with the last thrust of the knife or pin-he died. When Catherine de’ Medici brought the Ruggieri from Italy to be her sorcerers, she learned from them the secrets of the ‘devil dolls.’ This Queen of France went so far as to break these little effigies on a miniature rack, in order to increase the suffering of the enemies they represented. It was a common be - lief that she disposed of many persons in this way. There was a troubled moment in France when one of these dolls was found made to represent the Queen herself. From the Court of Catherine it is a long way to some little pueblo of the American southwest, but here the ‘devil dolls’ are still to be found, performing their same weird duties-as in the case of an Indian woman who, jealous of the skillful fingers of another rug weaver, made a doll and broke its hands, thus to destroy her rival’s skill."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"50 Healing, the Divine Art The fear that savage peoples have of being photographed or even painted rests in the belief that any harm that may come to the pictures will react upon them.

The man of today’s civilization feels that he has outgrown the magic of the primordial world. When he hears of hexing in Pennsylvania, voodoo in Louisiana, or of an outbreak of witch - craft in New Mexico, he smiles indulgently, wonders how such things can be in enlightened times. His belief is sincere that in the newer and saner way of life he has left behind forever the chanting and the drums. But he cannot escape hearing them; the very basis of modern jazz is the African rhythm, the re - sponse to it is mankind’s reawakening to old, very old memo - ries.

In reality, the two represent distinct stages in the development of occult practices. The Witch Doctor came first, and only through a long and complicated process of evolution was he developed into the Medicine Man. To describe the Indian mystic as a Medicine Man is a sin - gularly unfortunate choice of words. Semantically speaking, it causes, through association of ideas, an entirely erroneous conception of the whole structure of Indian metaphysics. With the term so fixed in the language that it is impossible now to change it, the need is to clarify as much as possible the natural confusion which results from the use of a familiar word in an entirely unfamiliar sense. We think of medicine as a medicinal substance used in the treating of disease, and so a Medicine Man would be one who gives medicines—a physician.

The term was bestowed some two hundred years ago by ignorant whites, with definite intent to disparage; and later, Medicine Man came into still further disrepute when the term was assumed by itinerant quacks, unscrupulous white men who peddled various ‘infallible Elixirs’ and ‘Snake-bite Cures,’ supposedly genuine Indian remedies, but in actuality, utterly worthless concoctions. The dictionary recognizes that medicine is a synonym for magic , as applied to magical forms of healing. This meaning, while a little closer to function, is still misleading. The Medi - cine Man is not necessarily a healer, although healing may be one of his duties. The Indian has long applied the word medi - cine to any mysterious force which is beyond his understanding. When the American army began to use repeating rifles against the Indians, these rapid firing guns were described among the tribes as ‘powerful medicine’; because the Sioux did not under - stand how the rifles could be loaded so rapidly. To the Indians, the Medicine Man was one who possessed supernatural powers as prophet, seer, thaumaturgist, priest, physician, spiritist or spiritual healer. He might be only one of these, or he might combine several of the offices in his person. Primarily he was a holy man; he was one who could speak with the spirits, he knew the ways of the gods. Frequently he was also the tribal historian, for most of these priests possessed re - markable memories. m i R a c l e s u n d e R e v e R w a T c h f u l e y e s Modern skeptics inclined to discount the supernatural pow - ers of the Medicine Man will do well to remember the con - ditions under which he worked. This prophet-priest lived his years and performed his miracles under the ever watchful eyes of his fellow tribesmen. They knew his life from the beginning; they had seen the mystic look come into his eyes; they had"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The American Indian Medicine Man 55 known that he would choose the way of the seer; they remem - bered his first visions, and many times they had seen him come back from his long vigils by the sacred fire. It would be difficult indeed for a man to be a deceiver from his infancy, especially when other watchful and sometimes jeal - ous Medicine Men were ever present to try the spirits. The wonder-worker was continually being called upon for various kinds of services, and if he failed in his enchantments he did not continue long in popular respect. Nor could he remove to some other community if his failures caught up with him. For the Medicine Man to remain in good standing throughout a long and eventful life, his experiments had to be successful in considerable number. The more highly advanced Indian na - tions were far too intelligent to be easily deceived, and it was among these that the mystery priest came to his greatest power and developed to full flowering his supernatural arts. If the tribe needed rain, it was the Medicine Man’s duty to find some way of producing it; excuses might work for a time, but there nevertheless must be rain, or there would certainly be a new Medicine Man. If a prominent member of the tribe was taken sick, the Medicine Man was expected to discover and administer the necessary remedies. Too many failures in this line would also be disastrous, and this magician could not hide behind the dec - laration of an ailment being incurable, as the modern physician can and does. Nothing is impossible to one possessing super - natural powers; the desired cure is the only satisfactory end to the sick call. If the hunting was poor, the Medicine Man was consulted as to the exact location of the game, and when he had made his pronouncement, the hunters started out. It is difficult to say what might have happened to the unhappy shaman had the animals not been there, and the hunters had to come back empty handed, for the simple reason that all available accounts"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"56 Healing, the Divine Art state that always the game was in the place that the priest had indicated. At various times the tribe might be expecting trouble from some other band of Indians, or later, from the menacing white men. Then there would be a council, with the Medicine Man required, upon demand, to describe the enemy war party, state its whereabouts and its strength. Often the survival of the entire tribe might depend upon the accuracy of the priest’s mystical vision; he had to be correct in every detail, although the enemy might be a hundred miles away. These were the daily tasks of the venerated seer, and the whole tribe stood judgment over the results. How many of our most highly trained scientists could qualify for the office of Medicine Man in a tribe of American Plains Indians? Only result; counted; excuses were buried with the dead. m e T h o d s o f T h e s P e c i a l i s T s i n h e a l i n g The more advanced Medicine Man who specialized in heal - ing had in addition to his magical powers some knowledge of medicine and surgery. His physiotherapy included massage, sweat-baths, sun bathing, counter irritation, and local pressure with the hands and feet. He also set broken bones, performed blood-letting, pulled teeth, and bandaged wounds. Dieting and fasting were practiced by most primitive peoples and the Medicine Man prescribed these whenever indicated. Herbs have been used from the earliest times, and the experienced practitioners compounded herbal medicines, and in some cases made use of animal and mineral substances. Medicine as science was highly developed among the In - dians of Yucatan and the Central American areas in the two thousand years prior to the coming of Columbus. These people fitted false teeth and artificial limbs, they perfected a number"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The American Indian Medicine Man 57 of surgical instruments, and they performed the Caesarean sec - tion long before the birth of Julius Caesar. Many important changes had to take place in the structure of ancient society before the dominion of the Witch Doctor was left behind and the Medicine Man became the keeper of his people. The most significant of these changes came gradu - ally in the sphere of religion. The God concept emerged, to put in order the spirit world of primitive man. The processes which brought this about can be studied among such peoples as the Egyptians; they had a large and complicated pantheon of divinities. The spirit guardians of powerful tribes gained prestige as these rose to temporal power. The conquered accepted the spirits believed in by their con - querors, and these victorious spirits gradually assumed the pro - portions of gods. There were gods of peace and war, gods of towns and villages, gods of earth, and air, and fire, guilds of the living and of the dead. As the nomes , or provinces, increased in strength their gods took on national influence and in the end the most successful deities became the superior gods and the less fortunate assumed the estates of tutelaries. With the belief in God came the transference of the tribal virtues to the person of this Invisible Being, the strong and lov - ing protector of his children. Thus God became good, because the ways of the tribe itself were always good. Man made his God in his own image, or in the image of that which he, man, desired to be. The tribal God was a great chieftain, a glorified extension in space of the physical chief. This spirit chieftain was the master of all the lesser spirits and ghosts and they had to obey him. This belief, that malignant agencies were no longer free to wander about afflicting at will, put the world in order. For now, if an evil being sought to do harm, the good God would come to the aid of his people and punish the offending ghost. The bad spirits resisted this loss of power of course, and tried in many"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"58 Healing, the Divine Art ways to outwit the God, but this was not possible, because the God who knew all things could offset the evil purpose of the wicked spirits. It was the good God against the bad ghosts, and the struggle resulted in anthropomorphism, the doctrine of God and devil fighting for control over the world. Soon, good men in this world tried to help the God, and lived according to his will; and after death their spirits could still help him; and also aid in protecting the tribe. Evil men, who disobeyed the God, continued after they had died to plague the living; and so it became necessary for the God to punish them. Thus good and evil came into being, White Magic and Black Magic were divided; and the sorcerer came into ill repute. s u f f e R i n g a s P u n i s h m e n T Then came a culminating psychological realization that was to modify the whole course of human effort. This was the be - lief that suffering was punishment for disobeying the good God. That made it necessary for all who were afflicted by sorrow or sickness to make an atonement for their sins in the form of an offering to the God. This conviction did not work out so well, for the reason that both the virtuous and the vice-ridden were subject to many of the same misfortunes. But the belief had been set up empiri - cally, so the facts had to be altered to fit the preconceptions. When no fault could be found in the unfortunate sufferer that would explain his ailment, an appropriate vice was manufac - tured. Such beliefs as that of the sins of the fathers being visited upon the sons, and “With Adam’s fall we sinned us all,” are remembered examples of endeavors to explain the misfortunes of the virtuous man. It was suspected, too, that evil spirits or ghosts might try to lure men away from the good God by various temptations; or, because of his personal goodness might afflict him out of spite."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The American Indian Medicine Man 59 This became a popular notion, and one that was to be compli - cated by the further involvement that the God himself might tempt his children, to discover how true they were in their de - votion. Saints wrestling with Satan, and Job plagued with boils are illustrative of these viewpoints. From primitive man’s floundering about trying to fit the facts of his living into the structure of his beliefs came some of the world’s most unpleasant and unconvincing religious doc - trines. We have to appreciate the spiritual problems of half- civilized mankind: Man obeyed his God, and suffered; he dis - obeyed his God, and suffered: he made offerings to his God, and still he suffered; or if he sold his soul to evil spirits, even then he suffered. Regardless of everything he suffered, he sick - ened and he died. Is it to be wondered at that in the end he decided that God wanted him to be miserable, and that there was something very wicked in being happy or comfortable? In this state of things there was no rest for the mind, and the ancient pressed on miserably in search of some livable code. He had reached the inquiring stage by now, and the after-death condition of the soul began to intrigue his mind. As late as Homer, ninth century bc, the Greeks believed that the departed dwelt forever in a gray shadow-land, so that the poorest living mortal was more fortunate than the most illustrious dead. But, it seemed obvious that God must live somewhere, and since he was invisible, his house must be invis - ible also; and so the invisible hut of the good God marked the beginning of our conception of the other world. These were days when greatness was measured in strength, skill, and phys - ical possessions. God resided in the best hut, had the finest cattle, and the most desirable slaves-was not God the mighty chieftain above all chieftains? So, heaven came into being. The Valhalla of the strong, it was adorned always in the best, in terms of the things most desirable to men, as witness when gold was introduced as the symbol of wealth, heaven was promptly paved with it."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"60 Healing, the Divine Art Heaven became the great escape for poor suffering mortals who had no peace in this world—But that puts us ahead of our story, for the Medicine Man came before theology had set itself in the doctrine of terrestrial misery and celestial bliss. He belonged to that pagan order of things that held to the belief in joy and in living the full life; he was not one to moralize too deeply about the origin of disease. He did believe in the good God, and in his simple way he came much closer to a sufficient natural religion than those who were too deeply involve them - selves in theological complications. He was never influenced by the conception that mankind was so wicked that it stood in constant need of salvation; and he was so respectful of the vari - ous religious beliefs of his neighbors that he could not be agi - tated by such questions as which of several faiths was the most inspired. What he knew was, his faith was suitable to him; he assumed that others had the same sense of security. R e l i g i o u s b e l i e f s a n d T h e g o o d s P i R i T It is not possible here to discuss fully the various Indian beliefs, for these were distributed among the many tribes and nations. But it may be said that most of the American Indians believed in one God, or Great Spirit, who communicated with his children through the visions and dreams of the priests, and sometimes through those of the laity. After death the soul might go to some Happy Land, or, as in the words of Chief Seattle: “When the last Red Man shall have perished from the earth and his memory among the white man shall have become a myth, these shores will swarm with the in - visible dead of my tribe.” Some Indians believed that the spirits of the departed remained among the living to serve and protect them in time of need. To the Witch Doctor all spirits were evil, but the Medicine Man regarded most spirits as good."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The American Indian Medicine Man 61 The Medicine Man brought forward many of the practices and beliefs of the Witch Doctor, but in every case with refine - ments and a marked improvement in the mental outlook. The mask, the rattle, and the drum remained, but all these imple - ments were now parts of an integrated religious viewpoint. In some sections of the country the Medicine Men still had to fight the wizards and the witches, but these adherents to Black Magic had lost caste and were ostracized by the respectable. Rites changed into rituals as the magical ceremonies were ex - plained in terms of religious symbolism. Every song and dance took on a definite meaning, one understandable in the light of tribal tradition. The spiritual leader was now entering into the time of his leadership. As priest he became the servant of his God, doing the will of the Great Spirit as revealed through an inner communion. The Medicine Man still sought his God in the old magical way, through dreams, visions, and trances. Most great lead - ers of the Indian nations from Hiawatha to Geronimo gained their strength from visions, for on occasion these might come to those who were not actually priests, The celebrated warrior Crazy Horse had a spirit experience in his younger days, and it is known that because of this he believed that he could never be slain in battle; and he was not. His death was brought about by treachery, under a flag of truce. During the Custer wars when one Medicine Man rode up to the American soldiers they fired several volleys at him from a distance of less than a hundred feet; but neither the Indian nor his horse was touched. When the magician returned to his own warriors he shook a number of bullets from his war shirt. Some tribes, like the Ojibway, required long periods of spe - cial training for those who would be medicine priests; but it was more usual for the youth to select the career himself and then rise to fame and authority by virtue of his powers alone."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"62 Healing, the Divine Art In a few cases the gifts of the spirit have been regarded as he - reditary or prenatal. Men too have been called by their visions late in life; but usually the visions began in childhood, and by the time the boy was twelve or thirteen years of age it was the common knowledge of the tribe that he would be a priest. Sometimes he studied with older Medicine Men, but this was not necessary as the visions taught him all the things that he should know. The finest book that has come to my attention on the sub - ject of the mystical experiences of a Medicine Man is Black Elk Speaks , the life story of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux. The work is autobiographical, and was given through an interpreter to John G. Neihardt. Black Elk’s great vision came to him when he was nine; the experience required twelve days, and during that entire time his body was lying in a deep coma, and his life was despaired of. He remembered that on his return from the spirit world, he saw his own body lying in the tepee, and as he came near to put on his body again, someone was saying, “The boy is coming to; you had better give him some water.” Many years later Black Elk was part of a troupe of Indians taken to Europe on a theatrical venture. While on the other side of the Big Water, this priest made a spirit journey to visit his parents on their reservation. This mysterious trip required three days, and during that time his body was in a deep trance and it was difficult to detect any breathing. These accounts may sound extravagant, but the Indian is a truthful man, especially in the matters of his religion. The mystical experiences described by the Medicine Men, when they will speak of such things-which is not often because of the ridicule with which such theories are received by most whites-are identical with those recorded among other nations which have developed elaborate occult traditions. The Indian mystics can see auras about the bodies of persons, can enter"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The American Indian Medicine Man 63 and leave their own bodies at will, can travel long distances in their spirit shapes, can converse with the dead and help them to find their way in the other world, can meet the fathers and grandfathers of their tribes who have gone long before, can see the future in clouds, can describe words as flames of light com - ing from men’s mouths, can feel themselves possessed by spirits and intelligences, and can understand the languages of animals and birds. It is important at this point to realize that most of the Medi - cine Men cannot speak any language but the tribal dialect of their people. It is not possible for them to have studied the metaphysical systems of India, China, or Egypt. It is more than interesting therefore, that they should describe their occult power in exactly the same way as do these other, far separated races. If there are genuine occult phenomena anywhere in the world they are present with the Medicine Men of the American Indians. m a s T e R s o f h y P n o s i s These priest-seers are also masters of hypnosis and mental suggestion; modern scientists have acknowledged their excel - lence, and there is everything to indicate that in their knowl - edge of the suggestive arts they are far ahead of the white man. In Medicine And Mankind , Eugene H. Pool, md , President of the New York Academy of Medicine, describes a medicine sing he attended which was given for the benefit of a young girl suf - fering from an advanced case of tuberculosis. “At the comple - tion of the sing,” he writes, “I said to the medicine man that I thought he worked much harder for his fee than I usually did. With a genial smile and a pat on my back he responded that he did his patient a lot more good, too. Perhaps he was right.” In the same book Dr. Pool also pays tribute to the Indian knowledge of suggestive therapy, in these words: “They have"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"64 Healing, the Divine Art used hypnotism and suggestive treatment far more effectively than we have, and quackery is now no more prevalent among them than with us. They have so combined religion and medi - cal practice that both are respected among them and both are re spec t able.” The modern physician of course has far greater knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and chemistry than the Indian, but the red man excels him in all the metaphysical aspects of the healing arts. Furthermore, the Medicine Man in most cases has been given his healing formulas in his visions, which may mean a great deal in the final consideration of the cure achieved. From any stand point the subject is strange and fascinating, and will sometime mean a great deal to the non-Indian doctor in his search for medical truths. It was my good fortune, some years ago, to see a fire-eating ceremony given by the California Indians. This was in no sense of the word a theatrical performance; it was put on by the tribe solely for religious purposes. A large heap of coals was prepared in advance, and an important Medicine Man came in from the desert to preside. After prayers and chanting that lasted well into the evening, the priest led his followers to the coals, and kicking the embers loose with his foot, he picked up a glowing coal with his hands and put it in his mouth. The others followed his lead, and soon a dozen or more were dancing about with the glow of the coals in their mouths showing weirdly through their cheeks in the darkness. The excitement spread to Indians who had gathered to see the ritual, and in a few minutes men, women, and children were holding the coals in their mouths. When the embers ceased to glow, the Indians spat them, out and selected new pieces. Among the participating fire eaters were two men with badges that showed they were reservation police, but the ceremony was otherwise given in great secrecy because of the violent opposition of church missionaries."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The American Indian Medicine Man 65 This ceremony belongs to the same general type as the famous Fiji Island fire-walking rites. In the Fiji ritual a long trench is dug and fires are burned in it for several days to make ready a bed of coals about six feet in width and from twenty to thirty feet in length. The heat is so great that it is impossible to approach the sides of the trench nearer than ten feet. The fire- walkers, after special preparation and sanctification, step into the fire pit and slowly walk the entire length. An occasional fire-walker will carry in his hand a piece of raw meat. When he has finished the fiery journey the meat is burned to a crisp; but neither the native nor his white body cloth is injured in any way. Examination of the bare feet of the fire-walkers fails to show even the slightest sign of scorching or blistering, yet the heat in the pit may exceed 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. If the power of the mind can prevent a man from being destroyed by such heat, it is time that the subject was given consideration in a much more useful way than merely as a study of personality complexes. To dismiss such miracles by the statement that they are the result of mass hypnosis, and that the audience only ‘thinks’ that it sees the fire-eating or the fire-walking, is a ridiculous evasion of the observable and provable in the actual happenings. Nor can these native ritu - als be compared with modern theatrical performances whose wonders are accomplished with the aid of advanced chemical know ledge and devices. A remarkable Medicine Man on the Blackfoot Indian Res - ervation at Gleichen, Alberta, has been described by Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance. The name of this mystic was Wolf Head; in 1928 he was still alive at the age of eighty-three years. Chief Long Lance writes: “That Wolf Head has a unique power that is unexplainable even to a highly educated white man is admitted by the present Blackfoot Indian Agent, George H. Gooderham, a graduate of Toronto University, a white man who was born among the Indians and has no queer notions about what they can, or cannot do.”"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"66 Healing, the Divine Art Wolf Head gained his medicine powers when struck by lightning at the age of seventeen, and the mystic faculties re - mained with him until he was converted to the Christian faith; then the visions ceased entirely. His most remarkable exploit involves Archdeacon Tims, a missionary to the Indians, who invented a method of writing the Blackfoot language. Wolf Head’s spirit-guide was called Boy Thunder, and one night this spirit appeared and taught the Medicine Man to write the Archdeacon’s characters. The next morning the Indian priest amazed the entire tribe, and especially the Archdeacon, who had tried in vain to teach his system, by writing the new sym - bols perfectly without having had any normal way of learning them. T h e i n d i a n h o P e o f T h e m e s s i a h About 1888 , a mystical Messiah doctrine, based largely upon visions and metaphysical experiences, spread rapidly among the Plains Indians from Missouri to the Rocky Mountains. The prophet of this new dispensation was Wovoka, a young Pai - ute Indian, whose seership arose as he was lying dangerously ill with a fever. An eclipse took place, and during the eclipse Wovoka was in contact with a strange power: He believed that he had been taken into the Spirit World, there to be given a direct revelation by the God of the Indian peoples. Songs and dances being an important part of the new faith, the sect is often referred to as the cult of the Ghost Dance. According to Stanley Vestal, in Sitting Bull: “The Ghost Dance was entirely Christian, except for the difference in rituals.” During the great Ghost Dance, given in September, 1890 , an Arapaho thaumaturgist named Sitting Bull (not the famous Sioux Medicine Man) performed hypnotism with the aid of an eagle feather. The miracle worker waved this feather slowly be - fore the eyes of the assembled subjects, speaking strange words"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The American Indian Medicine Man 67 in a slow measured tone. In a few moments definite hypnotism resulted, eyes became set and glassy, bodies grew rigid, and the Indians fell to the ground in complete coma or trance. They remained in this condition for varying lengths of time. Sitting Bull warned against disturbing the entranced persons: they were seeing visions and conversing with the spirits. From the details of this account it is evident that this important leader of the Ghost cult was using methods for producing trance in no way essentially different from those employed by psychologists fifty years later. Although the purposes of the Ghost Dance were entirely peaceful, and the sect was dedicated to nonresistance and brotherly love, the American government was determined to prevent the spread of the movement. The government attitude climaxed in the Massacre of Wounded Knee, when Indians, who had just surrendered their arms, were slaughtered in cold blood by Hotchkiss guns. The dead included 250 women and children. Thus was ended the Indian hope of the Messiah who was to right the wrongs of the red man and bring peace to the nations. s i T T i n g b u l l a n d T h e m i R a c l e s Among the most celebrated of the Medicine Priests of the American Indians was the other Sitting Bull. He was the Medi - cine Chief of the Hunkpapa Sioux. Father Beede, who spent the greater part of his life among the Sioux, spoke their language and knew most of their leaders, who was finally converted to their religion and initiated into their Sacred Medicine Lodge, is authority for the statement that Sitting Bull was baptized into the Roman Catholic faith. If this is true, he was probably baptized in 1868 by Father Pierre Jean De Smet.

It may be seen on his breast in a well-known photograph of the Chief by D.F.

My sense of truth requires this statement. I study his well attested words and acts in the light of which I myself have seen among Indians. At times his soul seemed to leave his body in part, while his body became some - what rigid, and traveled far away to regions where he beheld the movements of men and heard their thoughts as if they were speaking them in words. Difference of language seems to have been no impediment. Besides such an experience as this, there are many other things, including the foretelling of future events, which I can account for only on the ground that mira - cles of power and miracles of glory are allowed to occur among the heathen as well as among Christians. And I am inclined to think that such miracles occur more frequently among the hea - then. In their lack of the one ever perpetuated miracle of grace, they have more painful need of other miracles. The power of Deity is not restricted.” Sitting Bull’s name is most often associated with the sur - prise and annihilation of General Custer’s troop at the Battle of the Little Big Horn River.

He made medicine beside the body, and the spirit of the dead general appeared to him, and they conversed together. It was then that Custer warned Sitting Bull that he would die by the treachery of the whites, in fifteen years. After the ghost of Custer had vanished, Sitting Bull covered the face of the dead officer with a silk handkerchief that “Long Hair” him - self had once presented to the medicine chief. The details of this story are in Sitting Bull—Custer , by A.McG. Beede. Sitting Bull remembered this warning; several times he mentioned it to his fellow tribesmen. The fulfillment was as startling as the circumstances of the prophecy. Fourteen years and about seven months later Sitting Bull was assassinated by agents of the government at Standing Rock. At the time of the murder Sitting Bull was not on the warpath; he was peacefully sleeping in his cabin. An order was issued for his arrest, then the affair was so arranged that it was almost certain that the Chief could not be taken alive. Indians have claimed that the ghost of Sitting Bull has ap - peared on several occasions. On December 18th, 1890 , three days after his death, the spirit of the great chief appeared to the Two Kettle Sioux in the hills by the Bad River. The story was told by Tom Hetlund two days later. He said. “Night before last some Indians were returning from a little social gathering when a sight met their eyes that chilled them to the bone.

Among the Sioux he remains, to this day, a name to conjure with. h o l y m e n o f m e d i c i n e Since the establishment of the Indian reservations the Med - icine Men have for the most part remained to themselves; they seldom hang about the towns as do other Indians. Nor do they depend upon their powers for a livelihood, but engage in some occupation common to their tribe, such as farming, cattle rais - ing, or sheep herding. The American Indian priesthoods were not celibate orders, and many of the Medicine Men married and had families. In some instances, as among other nations, the holy men have chosen to remain single and devote their lives wholly to prayer and meditation. Medicine Men seldom interfere openly in the government of their people, but in other ways they exercise a very considerable influence in the compos - ite life of the tribe. The Indians of the Southwest present interesting problems to those interested in metaphysical healing. Many of their pueblos have been inhabited for hundreds of years. Community life for many generations molded the consciousness of the tribe, and it naturally follows that problems of social adjustment—the simple lessons learned by centuries of intimate living—color the religions and philosophies of these old town dwellers. It has been observed that whenever men live together in close and permanent association they come in the end to fear"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The American Indian Medicine Man 71 each other more than they fear gods or demons. And so, as might be expected, witchcraft is regarded by the pueblo Indi - ans as a principal cause of disease. Although demons and evil spirits are recognized as secondary causes of sickness, it is gen - erally accepted that these malignant agencies have been set in motion by witches, or by witchcraft. For example, disease may be caused by a wizard ‘shooting’ some foreign substance into the body of a person who has in - curred the animosity of the sorcerer. The stuff shot into the vic - tim may be small pebbles, bits of hair, sticks, or pieces of metal. The shooting is done by magic, and the unfortunate victim does not know that he has been so attacked until pain arises in the part affected. The Medicine Man’s search for the foreign substance is made with the aid of a magic eye, a bit of crystal or glass through which he looks as he examines the patient. This experiment in pain-hunting has been tried upon white men and women, and in several cases these experimental patients have admitted that the Medicine Man, although told nothing, located the exact place where the pain was the worst. Having discovered the place where the witch-shot entered, the next step is removal of the evil thing. The mystic healer places his mouth over the center of pain, sucks out the poison - ous object. This he shows to the patient and then causes it to be thrown away or destroyed. The sick man immediately feels the improvement and the cure follows. This seems to be a very literal application of the Hippo - cratic theory that disease is due to the presence in the body of some foreign substance. Unbelievers say that by sleight at hand the Medicine Man puts the pebbles, or other materials, in his mouth in advance of the treatment; if this is so, it is done so cleverly that such fraud is rarely discovered. Accidents, in which no magical element is suspected, are treated in the same way. A boy, studying in a United States"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"72 Healing, the Divine Art Indian School, slipped one day on a gravel path and received a most painful injury to his knee. Ordinary methods of treat - ment did little good and it was feared that the youth might be permanently crippled. In time, the boy, limping badly and in great pain, returned to his reservation, and his parents called in a Medicine Man. The healer diagnosed the trouble: a number of pieces of gravel from the path were still in the knee. These he proceeded to suck out, to the number of nine or ten, showing them to the boy and his parents. The knee improved immedi - ately. The youth was soon back in school, completely healed. In Oklahoma thirty years ago there was a famous Cherokee healer named Charlie Hughes. A ten year old boy was suffer - ing from a very unpleasant bladder difficulty, and the white doctors were unable to do anything for him. In desperation his father finally sent for Hughes. The Medicine Man told the boy to strip to the waist, and while the lad was doing so, Hughes went to the fireplace and took a shovel-full of coals. He warmed his hands over these coals for some time and then placed his warm hands on the boy’s back in the region of the kidneys. He rubbed the back softly, chanted some old healing melody, and then whistled a single note, which he repeated at considerable length. After some time he announced that he had finished and departed. His patient, now grown to healthy maturity, told me the story himself, and says that he has had no return of the trouble from that day to this-more than thirty years. Dr. Eugene Pool, already quoted, in Medicine And Mankind has this to say about these unusual Indian healers: “The leading doctor within my boyhood memory, in the district in which my parents settled, was an old Sioux medicine man, whose ser - vices were considered by the territorial government so valuable that when his tribe was removed to a reservation he was asked to remain with his white patients, among whom were my own parents. I am sure that much of the medicine I received as an infant and child was derived directly from the lore of this fine,"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The American Indian Medicine Man 73 learned, and much respected old man.” This statement from the President of the New York Academy of Medicine should be of significance to those who would dismiss the Medicine Man as an untutored savage. h e a l i n g b y s a n d - P a i n T i n g Among the Navajo and Hopi tribes, an important place in metaphysical healing is given to sand-paintings, or dry-paint - ings. These are traditional designs relating to divine matters, or to the mythical history of the tribe, and are regarded as bring - ing special virtues to the sick for whom they are made. These paintings are destroyed as soon as the ceremonies are finished; the designs are perpetuated by memory alone. Some years ago it was my privilege to have as a guest in Los Angeles, the late Hosteen Klah, a distinguished Navajo sand-painter and healer. He drew for me, with his own hands, twenty-six of the sand-painting designs on large sheets of card - board, and through an interpreter described the symbols and their meanings. He told me that in his healing work he made the sand-paintings large enough for the sick person to sit, or be laid, upon them, as part of the medicine ceremonies. Hosteen Klah, a noble Indian with the face of a sage and the manner of a scholar, said with all simplicity that when the ceremony was over the patient got well. Because of the great respect in which he was held by the Navajos, Lorenzo Hubell was permitted to make a complete motion picture record of a Navajo healing ceremony. The film, made about fifteen years ago, has never been publicly exhib - ited, but it was my good fortune to see a special showing at the Laboratory of Anthropology, Santa Fe, New Mexico. Miss Mary C. Wheelright, an authority on Indian religions, made a few opening remarks and occasional comments."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"74 Healing, the Divine Art The picture is most revealing, and shows the importance of the healing ceremonies in the life of the Navajo people. In the film, the principal Medicine Man is a cripple who appears to have suffered from infantile paralysis, for he has lost the use of his lower limbs. Known as “The Crawler,” he was brought from a considerable distance to officiate at the rituals. Close views of this holy man’s face showed a fine sensitive expression and a look of deep spiritual understanding. He used very little paraphernalia and depended largely upon the power of his own personality to win the confidence of his patients. Several other famous Medicine Men assisted The Crawler in the depicted healing ceremony, which lasted nine days. Others prepared the great sand-painting which was the central part of the ritual. Miss Wheelright made the observation that most Medicine Men are very poor, in answer to the often made ac - cusation that the rituals are intended for profit. No one can see this extraordinary picture without arriving at the firm convic - tion that everyone involved in the ceremony was utterly sincere and without any ulterior motive. In the book, Sandpaintings of the Navajo Shooting Chant, the author pays the following tribute to the healing priests of the Navajos: “My acquaintance with numerous medicine-men, the light in their faces, the conviction in which they speak of their belief, all suffice to convince me that their devotion is genuine. A fact that is incontrovertible is that, when discord or disease overtakes one of them, no matter how much power he has in his own right, he submits himself to the ministrations of his fellow Chanters with complete faith in their ability to relieve him.” If, as many would have us believe, the medicine priest is one who merely puts on a show for the sake of his own fame, or some reward he might hope to gain, surely he would be loath to trust his life to others of his kind.

Is this because he knows his own symptoms too well? Or is it because he knows his fellow doctors too well? The Medicine Man has no such qualms; he takes his own medicine with perfect trust, because it is the wisdom of his people, given in ancient times by the gods of the tribe. i n T e l l e c T u a l b i R T h b y ‘ f l y i n g s e e d s ’ Some of the Dakota tribes have a most curious and inter - esting belief about the origin of their Medicine Men. Before birth into the material world these priests come into intellec - tual existence in the form of thistle-like ‘flying seeds.’ These seeds are wafted about in the invisible spirit-world by the four sacred winds, until they come at last to the abode of one of the orders of gods. Here the spirit-seeds are instructed in magic and medicine, and also in the chants, feasts, dances, and sacrificial rites. This is accomplished by the process of the seeds ‘dream - ing’ of the gods. When they have completed their training with one group of deities the spirit-seeds fly on to another, and so continue until they have mastered all heavenly knowledge. At last, perfected in wisdom, these flying seeds make a great journey, the length and breadth of the earth, carefully observing the characters and usages of all tribes. In this way the spirit-priest decides where he will be born; and having made this decision, he enters into one about to become a mother, and thus incarnates in human form. When his earthly labors are over the Medicine Man returns to the abode of the gods whom he has selected to serve. Here he receives further inspiration and wisdom; and then, is born again as a mortal. Four is the sacred number of the Indian, and the medicine priest may be born four times into the physical life.

Description of the human spirit as a flying seed reveals an extraordinary grasp of metaphysical doctrine; and must have originated in clairvoyant examination of disembodied entities. Inclusion of the factor of metempsychosis (the passing of the soul at death into another body) also indicates that these Indi - ans were aware of the oriental belief in a plurality of lives. In a discussion of Medicine Men, it is to be remembered that women also fulfilled the various duties of the medicine cult. Medicine Women were held in equal esteem with the men, and became famous as spiritual leaders. The women frequently specialized in problems of childbirth. Like the Medicine Men, they combined magic and simple herbal remedies. c o n c l u s i o n s o f T h e m i s i n f o R m e d a n d u n i n f o R m e d The modern intellectual has considerable difficulty in ac - customing his mind to the animistic beliefs of older peoples.

The objections of the misinformed have been sustained by the uninformed; and oddly, the evi - dence is regarded as conclusive. In the discrediting of pagan miracles, and so-called ‘hea - then’ lore, missionaries have played quite a part. These pious men seldom lose an opportunity to disparage beliefs that differ from their own.

Now, it seems to me, if this method of reasoning is applied to the known accomplishments of the Indian Medicine Man, the simplest solution is to admit that he possesses psychic or mediumistic powers. Civilized man has departed from the ways of nature into artificial habits of his own invention. He has surrounded him - self with a material, economic, and industrial system which is no part of natural law; it is an ersatz structure ever threaten - ing to collapse upon its inventors. The modern intellectual gi - ant, hypnotized by the superstition that he is not superstitious, is burdened by groundless notions that any intelligent savage would laugh to scorn. Nature, wise in all her ways, bestows upon her creations the knowledge necessary for their survival. Man, in the process of becoming civilized, has dammed up his instincts and impulses, and thus has lost his psychic bond with universal life. He will blunder along, falling from one conceit into another.

While many modern authors mention it in connection with the history of medical arts, few devote more than a dozen lines to this extraordinary order of priest-physicians. This lack of interest among the scientific writers is due, no doubt, to the miraculous means by which the cures were accomplished. In the mild controversy about these cures, as to whether they were the result of mass delusion, or animal magnetism, it has not seemed to occur to many that the miracles might be exactly what the Greeks believed them to be, a divine remedy for hu - man ills. The first priestly healer to be mentioned in history was the Egyptian physician, Imhotep. This mighty man left to his peo - ple many proverbs and wise observations about sickness and health, and after his death he was elevated to the estate of a demigod. Temples were built in his honor and a priesthood served these shrines, perpetuating the remedies and magical formulas which he had given to the world. Schools of medicine 3 The greek Healing Cult of asclepius Hippocrates"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Healing Cult of Asclepius - Hippocrates 81 were established in the Houses of Imhotep, and clinics main - tained for the treating of disease. What Imhotep had done for the Egyptians, Asclepius was to accomplish for the Greeks. The sacred Mysteries of heal - ing were established in his memory and his descendants were priest-physicians until the end of Hellenic civilization. Homer refers to Asclepius as an historical person, a Thes - salian prince, and calls him the ‘blameless physician.’ Almost nothing is known of the life of this great healer. It is believed that he married Epione, a daughter of the King of Kos, and was the father of four children; two sons, Machaon and Podalirius, who also became physicians, and two daughters, Hygeia and Panacea, whose names are still remembered as terms in heal - ing. No date can be assigned to Asclepius with certainty, but he probably lived between 1200 and 1000 bc. It is possible that some factual elements may be involved in the myths which grew up about this demigod of medicine, since mythology has been defined as the history of prehistoric times. In most accounts, his father was Apollo, god of healing, and his mother was Coronis, a girl of Thessaly. When the father of the girl Coronis forced her to marry a mortal man, Apollo in his rage destroyed the family. Coronis, although about to bear a child, was slain by Apollo’s sister, the goddess Artemis. Apollo, as his desire for vengeance subsided, was grief stricken at his deed, and descending in his glory he rescued his unborn son from the burning body of Coronis as she lay on her funeral pyre. Thus Asclepius was brought into the world by a Caesarean section, possibly the first account of a child to be so born. It is generally agreed that Apollo took his infant son to Chi - ron, the centaur, to be educated. It was from Chiron, who was also the mentor of Achilles, that Asclepius learned the mysteries of medicine. Let us rationalize this part of the fable."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"82 Healing, the Divine Art h i s T o R y i n T i m e s P R e h i s T o R i c The centaurs have an important symbolical meaning, for they represent the children of Time . Their father was Saturn, the old god-Father Time. To the philosophic Greeks, therefore, the centaurs signified tradition , that which is born of ancient time. Chiron was wise in the old lore—the primitive experi - ence-record of the human race. He was indeed the very person - ification of tradition, this centaur with his human parts rising out of the body of the animal world. In this light the teacher in the fables takes on a rich new meaning. It is well to remember that all myths yield readily to reasonable interpretation. After Asclepius had learned all that Chiron could teach him, he entered upon his career as a physician and performed many great and wonderful cures. It is said that on at least one occa - sion he succeeded in raising the dead. This was his undoing; for Pluto, lord of death, fearing that in the end Hades might be depopulated by the skill and magic of a mortal man, appealed to Zeus to protect the dignity of death and the natural laws of the world. The Father of All then took one of his thunderbolts, fashioned in the fiery pits of Etna, and hurling it at the physi - cian, destroyed him with the heavenly flame. But a grateful humankind did not forget its Prometheus of Medicine, who had paid with his life for the life he had brought back. Asclepius was elevated to the rank of demigod, healing shrines were dedicated to him, his sacred Mysteries were estab - lished, and his descendants set apart as healing priests forever. Many temples to Asclepius were built throughout the Greek states, and later the Roman Empire. The most famous of these was the great Hieron, or sanctuary, at Epidaurus. This magnifi - cent group of buildings clustered about the central temple of the healing god, and in the adytum of this shrine was the gold and ivory statue of Asclepius, by the sculptor Thrasymedes."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"83"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"84 Healing, the Divine Art The divine physician of noble countenance was represented as a seated figure holding in one hand the serpent-wound staff.

They were large airy buildings, constructed for abundance of sunlight. As a proof that faith alone was not to be the basis of wonders, most of the temples of Asclepius were built near “me - dicinal springs, much like the modern spas. d i a g n o s i s a n d T R e a T m e n T o u T o f d R e a m e x P e R i e n c e s If the shrines themselves were remarkable, the method of healing practiced in them was even more so. The diagnosis and treatment were determined through oracles given by the god, himself. These oracles were dream experiences of the patients. When the sick came to the temple for healing, they went through a special period of preparation, and then the sufferers, clothed in new white garments, were brought on their couches into the presence of the statue of Asclepius, and left for the night. In their sleep, the sick saw the god come to life; he walked among them and spoke to them, and prescribed the necessary remedies. In the morning the patients told their dreams to the priest-physicians, who then prepared the medicines or magical formulas. The scientifically trained modern practitioner may call the whole thing a disgusting example of primitive superstition. But, the sick recovered. They were carried into the shrine one day, and on the third day thereafter walked out amidst the plaudits of the assembled multitudes.

Edgar James Swift quotes several accounts of these metaphysi - cal healings, taken from ancient Greek inscription of the fourth and third centuries bc . Dr. Swift’s opinion of these cures can be gathered from the title of his book, The Jungle of the Mind. For those interested in the records, and not in the viewpoints upon them, here they are, in digest: A boy who was dumb made his offering at the altar, and a •\t torchbearer of the god demanded of the youth a promise that if he were healed he would make the usual thanks offer - ing . “I promise,” replied the boy, and all were astonished; for in that instant he had recovered his speech. Pandaras, the Thessalian, besought the god to cure him of •\t scars on his forehead. He dreamed that the god bound his head with a fillet, and when he awoke the fillet was still there. He removed the fillet and found his scars gone. A man blind in one eye, which had only lids, (the eyeball •\t was gone), was visited in his dream by the god, who seemed to boil a drug and put it in his eyes. The next day he saw with both eyes. (This particular account is especially hard on Dr. Swift.) Aleetas, of Alicos, blind, dreamed that the god opened his •\t eyes with his fingers, and he saw the trees about the temple.

The modern doctor knows much more than the ancient priests, but naturally can - not compete with the supernatural! h i P P o c R a T e s , T h e f a T h e R o f m e d i c i n e Among historians of the healing arts there is a popular be - lief that Hippocrates of Kos was the Moses of medicine who led the physicians of his time from the Egyptian darkness of magic and superstition into the promised land of rational therapy. It is in order, therefore, to examine now the life and teaching of this great man, from the viewpoint of a metaphysician. Hippocrates, called the Father of Medicine, was born on the Greek island of Kos, in the year 460 bc. His father was of the family of Asclepiadea, the guild of priest-healers descended from the deified Asclepius. Early writers make much of the fact that Hippocrates was the seventh in lineal descent from the “divine physician.” The mother of Hippocrates, Phaenarete, traced her ancestry back to Hercules, the strongest of mortals. From such an illustrious background a genius could be expect - ed to emerge. Hippocrates studied medicine with his father, Hereclides, a celebrated healer. Later, in Athens, he sat at the feet of the physician Herodicus. For his philosophical education he was for a time the pupil of Georgias of Leontini, a brilliant Sophist; and he also received instructions from Democritus of Abdena, a man of vast learning, and one of the fathers of the atomic theory. Obviously then, Hippocrates was well schooled in those mental disciplines that are the necessary foundation of intel - lectual greatness."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Healing Cult of Asclepius - Hippocrates 89 Having completed his education, according to the custom of his time Hippocrates returned to Kos, there took his vows before the altar of Asclepius, and became a priest-physician as his father had before him. How much time he spent in the temple of the god of healing we do not know. In various places and for a greater part of his life he ministered to the needs of the sick; and we have his thoughtful consideration of their ail - ments preserved for us through his numerous writings. There can be no doubt that Hippocrates was the greatest of the Ascle - piadea, and the materialistic physician should remember that the Father of Medicine was to the end of his days a priest. How has it come about that Hippocrates has received in general the plaudits of medical historians, but the great order of priest-physicians that produced him has been passed over with hardly a grudging compliment? Had it not been for the Mysteries of Asclepius there could have been no Hippocrates. As greatness is honored, is not the cause of greatness equally worthy of respect? It surely is not reasonable to accept a man’s attainments and then deny, or ignore, the very things that made that man what he was. The predicament of the materialist is, how can he afford to honor the teachers of his hero, when to do so would force him to acknowledge the debt he owes to mysti - cal and metaphysical arts? A grateful world has showered honors upon the memory of Hippocrates; his knowledge, for his time, was extraordi - nary; and his personal character was above reproach; his clini - cal methods established a precedent which was to change the whole course of medical thought. All this is to be granted with - out reservation; but this is not the end of the matter, there is reason for resentment in a type of statement that in one form or another appears in almost every modern text on the early his - tory of medicine. Its general import is this: “Hippocrates was the first to separate medicine from superstition and priestcraft, to base its practice upon the principles of inductive philosophy, and direct especial attention to the natural history of disease.”"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"90 Healing, the Divine Art i n T h e h o u s e o f T h e h e a l i n g g o d It is not to be ignored that Hippocrates was born in the shadow of the Asclepian shrine, that his father was a priest- physician, that young Hippocrates first came in contact with disease in the healthy and hygienic atmosphere of the Hieron. Those wise and careful observations that have brought him the eternal gratitude of mankind were begun in the house of the healing god. Here the sick were arranged in wards, their bodily comfort assured by ever watchful attendants. Hippocrates could sit by their couches, listen to their symptoms, and watch the course of their ailments. He had the opportunity to observe and study thousands of cases and distinguish many types of disease; only the great clinics of Asclepius could have afforded such oppor - tunity for research. It was not possible to follow the condition of patients in the temples, as they came only for a short time, so it is probable that Hippocrates also formed clinics of his own so that he might observe the longer courses of some ailments. What little can be gathered about the private practice of Hippocrates indicates that his clinics were patterned, with certain modifications, after those of the temples. Some moderns would have us imagine that Hippocrates stood alone in a benighted world, one shining light in a uni - versal darkness. This is a little difficult to believe. Socrates, Plato, Democritus, Demosthenes, Aristippus, and even Aris - totle were among his contemporaries. He lived in the golden age of Grecian intellectual culture, one of the highest points in the philosophical life of the race. Plato and Socrates definitely believed in the Mysteries, accepted the mystical tradition, and acknowledged the existence of the gods and heroic souls; and these are considered reasons for materialistic opinion to seek to dim their glory."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Healing Cult of Asclepius - Hippocrates 91 T h e c e l e b R a T e d o a T h It would be interesting to know what Hippocrates himself believed—about such matters as the gods, and a future life. He was an initiate of the Asclepian cult, and the celebrated oath attributed to him opens with these words, “I swear by Apollo, physician, by Asclepius, by Hygeia and Panacea, by all the gods and all the goddesses—taking them to witness... etc.” So it could be suspected that Hippocrates was not a perfect example of emancipated materialism. It might also be recalled that very little of good has come to man, in any age, from those of little faith. Apropos of the Hippocratis jusjurandum —the great oath of medical ethics—there is some doubt among inquiring minds as to whether Hippocrates was its true author. Just as the Lord’s Prayer was lifted bodily from the Jewish Talmud, it is quite possible that the Hippocratic Oath was part of the Asclepian rites long before the advent of Hippocrates. This Oath, especially the opening lines, is not entirely satisfactory to the non-mystical minded. Not long ago I was privileged to sit in on an argument when precisely this thought worried several eminent medics. It was the final and mature opinion of these gentlemen that the Oath should be revised!— they wanted references to gods entirely removed, as inconsis - tent with the state of modern enlightenment. It is a little difficult to believe that the priest-physician who took his Oath, when oaths were meaningful, “by all the gods, and all the goddesses” is the same man, according to many texts, who “separated medicine from the priestcraft.’ Hippo - crates, we know, through a series of clinical observations, made a number of important discoveries concerning the nature and course of disease, and the effects of various remedies, not gener - ally known before his time. But this does not prove that he had any intention of overthrowing priestly medicine. Nor does it"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"92 Healing, the Divine Art indicate any intention to deny the spiritual factors in the prob - lem of health. It is true that Hippocrates said that “there is no authority except facts,” but the Greeks certainly would have been the first to assert that it would be a poor religion that facts could tumble from the sky. The Jesuit Father, Athanasius Kircher, discoverer of a number of facts important to medicine, remained a devout man; he never expressed any fear that his findings would overthrow the Papacy. It is probable that the secular physician did come into being as a result of the Hippocratic emphasis upon the physical causes and treatment of disease, but in many ways this separation was a loss rather than a gain to medicine. The division was not nec - essary to scientific progress. A religious system that produced such outstanding individualists as Pythagoras and Plato would not have hindered the medical practices of Hippocrates. There is no evidence that any effort was made to interfere with any of his methods. Hippocrates practiced his medical convictions and communicated them to his disciples without hindrance or persecution, as did most other teachers of his time—so long as they did not involve themselves in politics. T R e a T m e n T b y n a T u R a l m e a n s a l o n e Hippocrates proved, probably without fully realizing the implications himself, that many diseases can be treated success - fully by natural means alone. There were numerous advantages to this viewpoint, but there were also many serious disadvan - tages, as time was to prove. The greatest good that came from the Hippocratic reformation, so-called, was the impetus that it gave to the physical aspect of medical research.

What were the medical opinions of Hippocrates of Kos? He divided the causes of disease into two general classes; the first external, as weather, climate and locality; and the second, internal or personal, as habits, diet and exercise. He believed that appearance, disposition, and mentality were largely influ - enced by climate , thus explaining the general superiority of the Greeks. The decline of the Greeks, in spite of their admirable locality, he did not ‘live to see or explain. Disease, according to the Hippocratic doctrine, was due to the derangement of the “four humours,” or bodily fluids; these are blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. When these hu- mours were not in proper proportion or arrangement sickness invariably followed, and if they could be coaxed into a more propitious relationship a cure could be effected. The Father of Medicine was more famous for prognosis than diagnosis, and was accused of a fatalistic attitude in treatment. He may have brought this fatalism with him from the Ascle - pian temples, for the rules of these shrines included one to the effect that cases obviously hopeless could not be treated. With Hippocrates, if previous cases of a similar nature had ended fatally, he was not likely to oppose the course of the disease. The Hippocratic theory of treatment has been called “cau - tious and expectant.” Diet and baths were his favorite remedies, and he made considerable use of herbs. Leclerc collected a list of almost four hundred milks, wines, fruits, vegetables, fats, and other “simples” which he prescribed. Horns of the ox and stag, and the excrement of the goat, mule, ass, goose, and fox are included in his pharmacology. The opinions of Hippocrates on the subject of astrology arc particularly obnoxious to modern practitioners. Treatment was not his greater bid to fame, although he was honored by the Athenians for his services during the outbreak"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"94 Healing, the Divine Art of the plague. Hippocrates was primarily an observer of dis - ease, and his two sons, also Asclepian physicians, assisted him in compiling the various case-histories that became the basis of his writings. He was sometimes accused of being more inter - ested in watching his patients than in trying to help them, and he was accused by his contemporaries of letting the sick die by “doing nothing to keep them alive.” In this practice he differed markedly from the modern physician, who prolongs life by any means in his power on the assumption that hope lingers until actual death. It was probably his prognostic skill that caused Hippocrates to neglect cases he regarded as hopeless. Eighty-seven books are attributed to him, but most of these were probably by other learned physicians of his time, some with the same name as himself. This would indicate that he was one of a considerable group of similarly minded men. On this subject, in The Doctor In History, Howard W. Haggard, Associate Professor of Applied Physiology at Yale, writes: “Hip - pocrates exists as a name rather than a man. Under that name we group all the great and now forgotten men of Greece who in the fifth century bc formed the scientific basis of medicine.” T h e w R i T i n g o f h i P P o c R a T e s The principal works of which Hippocrates of Kos is now believed to be the author, treat such subjects as prognostics, epi- demics, diet , and air, water and locality. Some of the best of his writings are the Aphorisms , short and spirited sentences, factual and descriptive. The most famous and discouraging of the aph - orisms is, “Life is short and art is long.” Another is typical. “If a dropsical patient is seized with hiccup, the case is hopeless.” Under the name of Bokrar, Hippocrates was known to the Arabs, and his writings were treasured among them through the long night of Europe’s dark ages. A considerable mythology"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Healing Cult of Asclepius - Hippocrates 95 has grown up about this great physician and miracles have been attributed to him that do not appear inferior to the wonders performed by the divine Asclepius, As many of these myths are of Grecian origin, and some of them are very ancient, it would not appear that Hippocrates was regarded as a materialist by his contemporaries or followers. If older opinions are confused, the moderns are no better. Logan Clendening in his book, Behind the Doctor , published in 1933 , writes, “It is doubtful if there was any single personality known as Hippocrates.” It would be rather embarrassing if the father of factual medicine was himself a myth! One thing is certain however, the majority of medical histo - rians do not believe their great physician to be a figment of the imagination. To them he is a very real person, with a long gray beard, and scholarly, if un-Grecian, appearance. How little we really know about these matters upon which we are so sure. My own opinion is that there are few myths that do not root in realities, and Hippocrates was most certainly an actual person, but many of his accomplishments originated among the think - ers of his own, or earlier times. o R i g i n o f T h e b e d s i d e m a n n e R Another important contribution that Hippocrates made to modern medicine was the bedside manner. The physician en - tered with dignity, and if the ailment was not in a violent stage, seated himself beside the patient and ‘artistically’ questioned him concerning his age, his manner of living, his recent expo - sure to infection or contagion, his diet, his previous ailments, and the special seat of the present discomfiture and the symp - toms. This was usually followed by a general examination. He had also to encompass the delicate matter of previous physi - cians and their prescriptions, for it was not ethical to question"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"96 Healing, the Divine Art the ability of a fellow practitioner. Then followed the new medi - cation and recommendations. This, the Hippocratic procedure, has varied little since his day. Concerning the later life of Hippocrates nothing is known, except that he died at Larissa. Ancient writers have given the length of his life variously as 85, 90, 104 and 109 years. Clinton favors 104 years, but most moderns are more conservative, the larger figures do not sound factual to them. He had at least two sons, Thessalus and Dracon, but the date of his marriage and the name of his wife are not preserved. Thus little we know of the wise old physician whose name is burdened with the responsibility of having divided, forever, the art of healing from its priestly founders. The more we study his mind and his methods the more we feel the injustice that has been done him in the name of glory. What Hippocrates really believed was, the gods help those that help themselves. He taught that men should not depend upon divine aid for all the infirmities of their flesh, but should seek natural means of binding up the wounds of their indiscretion. This is not only good science, it is good religion. The many Catholic and Protestant hospitals in our com - munities, equipped with every modern instrument of diagnosis and healing prove that religions do not reject progress in sci - entific knowledge. The great ‘division’ is in the mind alone, and attitudes, not facts, are responsible for the long antagonism between the gods and the doctors, to the dishonoring of both. In his treatise on the sacred sickness [epilepsy], Hippocrates reveals his true position in his own words. “Such things,” he writes, “are divine or not—as you will, for the distinction mat - ters not—and there is no need to make such division anywhere in nature, for all things are alike divine or all are alike human.” Here, the physician, in his own words, denies the very division that has been in his name.

Where there are many schools teaching different - ly about the same thing all learning is obscured. Mankind is united in all essentials, and divided only in those things which are of secondary importance. But it has been fashionable to magnify the difference and ignore the great unities that bind the world together. Selfishness and stupidity caused the Dark Ages, the Inquisition, the wars and economic upheavals that have plagued mankind for ages, and last but not least, the dis - cords of religion, divided as it is into hundreds of sects, which would serve God by plaguing one another. T h e o R a c l e s a n d h e a l i n g s h R i n e s The discoveries made by Hippocrates did not destroy the cult of Asclepius, It remained for centuries the principal custo - dian of public health. A great plague broke out in Rome and threatened to destroy the entire city. The Romans sent an embassy to Epidaurus to beseech the help of the god of healing. The oracles were ques - tioned and Asclepius was pleased to listen to the need of the Romans. He permitted himself to be taken to Rome in the form of a living serpent. As the ship was sailing up the Tiber on the return journey, the god glided over the side of the boat and took to himself an island in the river. The Romans, taking the action as an omen, built their sanctuary to Asclepius on this island, and through the favor of the god, the plague was overcome. A memorial tablet has been found on the site of this temple on the Island of the Tiber. The tablet commemorates four mi - raculous healings that took place in this shrine. The substance of the four inscriptions is as follows: Gaius, who was blind, consulted the oracle and was cold to •\t approach the altar, offer prayers, cross the temple from right to left, place his five fingers upon the altar, raise his hand"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"98 Healing, the Divine Art and place it upon his eyes. He recovered his sight at once in the presence of many persons. This occurred in the reign of Antoninus, (about 120 ad ). Valerius Aper, a blind soldier, consulted the oracle, and was •\t told to mix the blood of a white cock with honey, and rub his eyes with this ointment for three days. He recovered his sight, and gave thanks to the god. A certain Julian, who had hemorrhage of the lungs, con - •\t sulted the oracle and was told to go to the altar, thence take some pine nuts, mix them with honey and eat them for three days. He was cured. The son of Lucius was dying of pleurisy. Asclepius appeared •\t to him in a dream and told him to take ashes from the altar, mix them with wine, and apply them to his side. He was saved and gave thanks to the god. If these inscriptions are representative of Asclepian therapy it is not difficult to understand why the Greeks and Romans so greatly admired their cult of priestly-physicians, Since the rise of the psychological viewpoint it is customary to dismiss all accounts of miraculous healing as ‘purely psychic,’ or as ‘the result of mental suggestion.’ This attitude is justified by the as - sumption that only functional ailments could be so treated, that none but the secular physician was qualified to cope with serious, organic disorders. Let us apply this kind of logic to the testimonials on the As - clepian tablet from the Island of the Tiber. Blindness, hemor - rhage of the lungs, and pleurisy, are not superficial ailments by any standard of medicine. It may be true that blindness can be caused by hysteria; but again, it is more often the manifestation of very serious bodily ills. It is difficult to believe that hemor - rhage of the lungs is merely a mild form of psychic disturbance, and its instantaneous cure is something for medical men to think about.

Not long ago, a man selected my sympathetic ear to pour into it the long tale of his physical woes.

Is it possible that the initiated priest- physicians of antiquity did possess a spiritual insight into the origin and treatment of disease, which was lost to the secular doctor when he severed his connection with the great, mystical institutions of healing? The modern materialist assumes a negative answer to this question, but an assumption is not a fact. When Plato opened his school in the Lyceum he discovered that a nearby swamp rendered the location unhealthful. After a short time he was stricken with a dangerous fever caused by the fetid air. His disciples recommended that he move the Acad - emy to a salutary location.

He died in his sleep, with the books of the poet Sophron under his head for a pillow. A swamp is not a fixation, a phobia, a neurosis, or an inhi - bition; it is a very real source of bad health. A mental attitude alone is not enough to overcome its evil force, nor is autosug - gestion a reasonable answer. Plato might have denied that the swamp could hurt him, but in the end his constitution would have been undermined. There is much more than mere affirm - ing and denying to metaphysical healing. It appears certain that Plato knew how to make himself immune to the local fevers. Who can deny that such knowledge would be valuable, even in this time of inoculations? Plato taught by his example that man possesses within him - self the power to cure the diseases of his body, that in the end, every man is his own priest, and every man is his own physi - cian. Wisdom is a universal medicine, and the only remedy for ignorance, the great sickness of mankind.

By this time secu - lar medicine was well established in Rome, and by numerous Greek physicians who were not priests; so we may assume that they were products of the ‘great separation’ attributed to Hip - pocrates. These doctors had first come to the Roman Empire"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Healing Cult of Asclepius - Hippocrates 101 about two centuries before the Christian Era, and because of the Roman respect for Greek culture, they established large and profitable practices. By studying these men we may discover some of the immediate results of the secularizing of medicine. These physicians who had left spiritual values far behind in their haste after physical knowledge, were, on the whole, a scurvy lot. Cato cried out against them, declaring that the Romans had flourished for six centuries without doctors, only, in the end, to be murdered by Greek physicians. To these in - quisitive medics the human being had lost his identity as a son of God, and had become a case-history. Of their thirst after knowledge, and their ethics generally, Pliny writes: “It is at the expense of our perils that they learn, and they experimentalize by putting us to death, a physician being the only person that can kill another with sovereign impunity. Nay, more than this, all the blame is thrown upon the sick man only; he is charged of disobedience forthwith, and it is the person who is dead and gone that is put upon trial.” It was at this point, also, that commercialism reared its ugly head. The priest-physicians were attached to temples that were supported by the state. If grateful patients, who had been ben - efited, wished to make gifts to the temple, well and good. Most of the shrines were filled with treasures, along with lesser gifts of no physical worth given by the poor, but every offering was a token of actual assistance. Secular Greek doctors, however, charged high fees; they based these upon the limit of the finan - cial means of the sufferer, and they charged the same whether the patient lived or died. Where medicine ceased to be a reli - gion it became a business. When Cato said that the Romans had gone along for six hundred years without doctors, he meant that until the appearance of the Greek medics the healing arts had been in the keeping of the sacerdotal class. The priest-phy - sicians and the temple of healing were the sole custodians of the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"102 Healing, the Divine Art public health during the rise of the Roman Empire, the secu - lar physicians were in authority during the decline. Until the coming of the Greek doctors the Romans had never paid a fee for medical attention, but the crafty Greeks assured their new patients that a man only appreciates what he pays for. The new therapy removed the superstition of Divine aid, and substituted for it the superstition that money can buy health, and pay for dissipation. The greater harm was that the high prices kept health away from the poor, and it was the poor who had to fight and die for the glory of Rome. The Romans had quite a time adjusting themselves to the new scientific viewpoint in medicine; they made laws against malpractice, regulated fees, and devised legal methods to hold physicians responsible for their mistakes and the consequences. The new doctors were supposed of course to be men of high principles, and they had taken the Hippocratic Oath, but it could be questioned how important is an oath to the gods, when belief and faith in those gods is itself undermined. These men were no longer ruled by their own spiritual convictions, by the belief in the reality of Divine powers; and then, as always, it was necessary to govern their actions by man-made codes to protect society from an excess of exploitation. It has ever been difficult to make laws against a privileged class, especially if this class organizes itself against any regula - tions that interfere with its complete freedom of action. The Romans found this out when they tried to regulate the practice of medicine. They succeeded in part, but never again did the Eternal City enjoy that freedom from medical crime that had been there before the coming of the Greek doctors. For several centuries priestly healing and materia medica dwelt side by side in a state of armed truce. To the priests, the secular physician was guilty of the grossest form of sacrilege; and to the emancipated doctors the priest were a superstitious lot insofar as their claims to healing were concerned.

T h e i n f l u e n c e o f b e a u T y o n h e a l T h When secular medicine separated from the Asclepian Mys - teries, its departed in such a hurry that it left behind many of the most important factors and fixtures of the healing art. Primarily it left behind the exalted ethical standards that must apply to all relations between the public servant and the public he serves. It was taught in the temples that wisdom was a divinely bestowed superiority; and that men so favored by the gods must always deport themselves in a manner worthy of the confidence which their wisdom inspires. In their hurried exit the new doctors also overlooked the part that beauty plays in the health of mankind. Utility be - came their one obsessing concern, and even today, after centu - ries of progress, the modern hospital looks more like a factory than a temple of health. The temples of Asclepius were places of beauty and gentle dignity. There may have been less efficien - cy, but there was certainly a noble and beautiful spirit in these sacred places. The priest-physicians were servants of a loving god who looked down with infinite pity upon his suffering world. The body of man was the living temple of a living spirit, and it was gently and reverently cared for. Why is it not pos - sible for the world, rich and powerful far beyond the dreams of the Greeks, to restore this kindly way of health, adding all their scientific knowledge can bestow? Surely in this later day healing can be practiced with the same wise beauty that the ancients knew.

This famous temple on the Island of the Tiber, the first hospital, served the rich and the poor without discrimination. The wisest men of all times have believed in the reality of spiritual values, and they have been inspired to the service of the human need, not by hope of profit, but by love of man. Religion there must be, if the race is to endure; and nowhere is religion more essential than among those who are learned and skilled. There should be something of the priest in every physician, and something of the physician in every priest. Each needs the other, and not the so-called division between them, which is the modern boast. Two schools of medicine have come down to us through the ages, honored and respected by mankind. The first, and oldest, is spiritual medicine, with its doctrines of faith, prayer, penance, divine intercession, miracles, and if you like, a pure and unselfish magic. The second and much younger school is material medicine, developing newer ways of chemistry, bio - chemistry, and electricity. Between these two now stands psychology, old in principle but new in technique, which must try to unite the mystic and the medic for the survival of the race. There seems no good reason why so many scientists should strive eternally to destroy mysticism, and to condemn and ridicule the old ways which made men happier and better.

The attitude of the early Christians on the important subject of mystical healing may be summed up in the words of the Apostle James: “Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.” The Epistle of James, 5, xiv-xv. Of the miracles of Christ, the devout Alexander Cruden wrote: “Our Savior confirmed the doctrine which he taught by a train of incontestable miracles: they were so great in their na - ture, so real and solid in their proof, so divine in the manner of performing them, by the power of his will; so holy in their end, to confirm a doctrine most becoming the wisdom and other glorious attributes of God, and for the accomplishment of the prophecies concerning the Messiah , whose coming as foretold was to be with miraculous healing benefits; that there was the"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"108 A quaint old portrait which records the death by poison of Paracelsus of Ho - henheim, the greatest metaphysical physician in the history of Europe.

Most of the pagan faiths which flourished in the early centuries of the Christian Era could also advance miraculous happening to justify an equal claim to divine overshadow - ing. To extricate themselves from this embarrassing situation the early Fathers had recourse to the second Chapter of Sec - ond Thessalonians , in which is described the “man of sin” who should come with lying wonders after the working of Satan. By various improvisations upon this theme, it was demonstrated to the satisfaction of the pious that all miracles not arising within the Christian faith were snares and delusions, originated with the devil, and calculated to destroy utterly all who regarded them favorably. This solution invited disaster, for it stigmatized all non- Christian beliefs, and set the stage for a vast program of reli - gious intolerance. The devil became the ruler of three quarters of the earth. The Church had set itself the heroic task of fight - ing his power in the four corners of the world. And, as might be suspected, non-Christians did not take kindly to the idea that they were worshippers of Satan, and as the centuries passed, the inevitable consequences of these theological pronouncements were Holy Wars and Crusades.

He cast seven devils out of Mary of Magdala; and in Gerasa he caused a legion of evil spirits to depart out of a man and enter into a herd of swine. Miracles of this kind justified the theological doctrine of demonic possession, and strength - ened generally the public belief in the reality and power of evil. It was upon the authority of the scripture therefore, that the medieval Church made an extensive study of demonology; and the casting out of evil spirits became an important part of the healing arts during the Middle Ages. e v i l d e m o n s i n T h e h e a l i n g a R T s As the various isolated Christian communities of the first three centuries were gradually drawn together into one great assembly, the historical Church began to take form. Much of its symbolism and many of its rites were patterned after the pre- Christian religions of India, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Every effort was made to conceal this borrowing, but from the wider vista of present knowledge the borrowings are evident. The Christian doctrine of the canonization of saints, it seems to me, came directly from the Hindus, especially the Buddhists, and the Greeks. Because of the importance of the saints in the reli - gious healing of the Church, it seems well to look more closely into this phase of spiritual tradition. s a i n T h o o d o n l y T h R o u g h P R o v e d m i R a c l e s In the early years of the Christian faith, canonization was performed by the local communities.

He is first made Venerable. Then, after further con - sideration and evidence, he is advanced and becomes known as Blessed. If additional investigation proves his worthiness, he receives the final honors and the word Saint is placed before his name. Except in the case of Martyrs, it is usual for the sanctified state to be discovered by miracles, performed in the lifetime of the Saint, and further proven by his miraculous interces - sions after death. When the candidate for canonization has been advanced to the state of Venerable, “at least two impor - tant miracles wrought through the intercession of the servant of God must be proved,” before he can be acknowledged as Blessed. And two further miracles must take place through the intercession of one called Blessed, before canonization can be completed. One who is Blessed may receive veneration locally, and prayers may be addressed to him under certain conditions, but only after canonization may he be appealed to by the whole body of the Church. The Saints were important in the mystical medicine of the medieval Christian faith, even as in the Catholic Church of today. They were called upon selectively by those suffering from various ailments. St. Apollonia was prayed to for toothache, St. Valentine for epilepsy, St. Virus for nervous disorders, and St. Anthony of Padua for difficult childbirth. Charms bearing the likenesses of different Saints were worn for protection, one of the most popular being the medals of St. Christopher, sup - posed to preserve travelers from the dangers of their journeys.

It was well that the Church did not further complicate the life of the physician; he was having trouble enough with the patron saints of his own profession. There was Galen to make things difficult, and later was Avicenna, to make them more difficult; and then with the two of them, the confusion was worse confounded. g a l e n a n d a v i c e n n a Greatest of the Greek physicians to practice in Rome was Galen, (Claudius Galenus), born in Mysia, 131 ad. His fame in medicine won him the appointment of official doctor to the school of the gladiators at Pergamos, the city of his birth. He attended several of the Roman Emperors, and according to the Arabic tradition, died in Sicily about the year 201 ad. In anatomy, Galen is known for his persevering dissection on the bodies of animals, but he had no opportunity for a de - tailed study’ of human structure. In physiology, he was domi - nated by the four humours of Hippocrates, and sought to cor - rect their unbalances by medicines of sympathy and antipathy. Galen was much given to magical processes, and put more faith in amulets than in drugs. According to Cullen, he is supposed to be the originator of the anodyne necklace so long famous in England. Avicenna (Ibn-Sina), the Moslem philosopher and physician, ( 980-1037 ad ), was a student of the writings of Ga - len, and his principal interpreter among the Eastern, and later, the European nations. He added many opinions drawn from Aristotle, and mixed with these considerable Neo-Platonic lore and a great inspiration gathered from early study of the Koran. Like Galen, he had very little actual knowledge of the human body and its functions."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Healing During the Rise of the Christian Church 113 Both Galen and Avicenna left voluminous writings, and their books became the official texts of the medieval physician. These ‘priceless’ treatises were interminable volumes, rich in noble generalities, and laden with philosophical discourses on every subject from stomach ache to falling sickness, with oc - casional references to volcanoes. It is beyond doubt that the books of Galen and Avicenna retarded medical progress for hundreds of years; but in their time, there was neither recourse nor relief from their authority. Galen was medicine’s god, and Avicenna was his prophet. T h e P l a g u e s o f T h e d a R k a g e s The thousand years from the fourth century to the four - teenth is the period usually referred to as the Middle Ages, with the first six hundred years graphically designated the Dark Ages. It is pretty much of a mystery what happened to human nature and human progress after the fall of the Roman Empire. All that can be said with certainty is that European civiliza - tion was in the doldrums for a millennium. The wisdom of the classical civilizations was lost, and not until after the Crusades did the minds of men finally shake off the inertia of these mel - ancholy times. Many have asked if the Christian Church was responsible for the Dark Ages. In some ways possibly, but in general it was a victim in common with the rest. The pivotal cause seems to have been the collapse of pagan Rome, for with it passed the law and order of its time. A second cause was the closing of the schools of Athens by Justinian, in 529 ad . The Church may have been partly responsible for this, but the emperor himself was largely to blame. H.G. Wells, in his Outline of History, takes another view of the case. “It is not perhaps true,” he writes, “to say that the world became miserable in those ‘dark ages’... much nearer the"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"114 Healing, the Divine Art truth is it to say that the violent and vulgar fraud of Roman imperialism, that world of politicians, adventurers, landowners and financiers, collapsed into a sea of misery that was already t here.” The Wells’ analysis is thought provoking, but it seems a little strange that a great cultural system, built up through thousands of years of human effort, in a dozen highly civilized nations, and able to survive the vices of Imperial Rome, should have perished with the fall of a system of which it was never a part. The arts and sciences were not driven to Islam simply by the Roman debacle. More likely an ignorant aristocracy took the place of a corrupt one-always, the beggar on horseback’s first act is to persecute the learned. From the meager history that lights the Dark Ages it would seem that a succession of plagues and fevers ravaged most of Europe. These nearly always follow in the wake of War. The armies of Attila were stricken while invading Northern Ita - ly. Barbarians had broken up the existing pattern of life and brought nothing in its place. Men were wandering about hope - lessly, spreading chaos and the plague. Earthquakes added to the general misery and terror, as whole cities vanished from the earth. Famine also swept the continent; the death rate was appalling. By establishment of the monastery system the Church did what it could to preserve the remnants of culture—but only such parts as were not in conflict with the dogmas of the faith. In “the monastery libraries the great texts of medicine, art and music were preserved, together with many of the older scienc - es such as mathematics, geometry, astronomy, logic, rhetoric, and the languages. These monasteries were virtually the only schools, and the clergy, with no worldly ties and with ample time for study, became the only literate class.

The Benedictines"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Healing During the Rise of the Christian Church 115 were the monastery builders, and in time they added schools to their Holy Houses; from these simple schools grew the great universities that were to become the pride of Europe. The Church patronized the universities generously, and kings and princes followed its example. Lack of knowledge was the primary impediment to the progress of these schools. Four branches of learning were fa - vored; belles-lettres, law, medicine, and theology. To enter the universities, it was usually necessary to sign a statement to the effect that the applicant was a Christian, over twenty years of age, a freeman, not a peasant, and of good family. Then, as now, there was also a delicate financial consideration. The curriculum was impressive but sterile. Hooded savants on gilded thrones lectured, or simply read, from ancient au - thorities; and the students sat, listened, believed, accepted, and were overwhelmed, but not informed. Neither science nor the Church was particularly to blame; there was no one who knew more to lead the rest to a better way. The colleges of medicine were typical of the rest. They were grand and impressive necropolises, where somber professors mumbled over the dead tomes of Galen and Avicenna. Dis - eases were worked out by mathematics, and remedies selected because the herbs themselves resembled the afflicted organ. Thus toothwort was recommended for toothache, ivy for the nerves. These were the times of the unicorn’s horn and the be- zoar stone.

The Pissasphaltos mumie, highly recommended by Dioscorides, was made from the crystals found on the bodies of mummies embalmed with bitumen-but our authority notes how this is very difficult to secure and is extensively counterfeited by the apothecaries. The Lybian mumie was derived from bodies that had been swallowed up by Lybian quicksands, and had not been embalmed at all. This delightful argument was finally solved by the discovery of a still more important mumie that could be made from the moss growing on the skull of an executed criminal. Thus went medicine in the good old days, when men feared the physician more than they did the disease. Medieval doctors did not exactly burn the midnight oil in a consecrated search for new ideas in medicine. They were quite impressed with their’ own magnificence, smug and self- satisfied, and of a mind to murder any confreres whose origi - nality threatened their composure. The prince, the priest, and the physician alike were members of closed corporations; they hung together for mutual support in times of trouble; and when fortune favored, they pillaged from each other, with a good conscience. In the heyday of the clergy the heavy hand of ecclesiasti - cal displeasure fell not on the physician, but on the astrono - mer.

The Church acted against these men with all sincerity—but with a woeful lack of knowledge—to put these innovationists back in their places before they tore the universe apart. It does not appear that the early Church made any general effort to limit the study of medicine, or to declare against its practices. The Church respected the doctor, according to the authority of Eccl. 38, i, iv: “Honor the physician for the need thou hast of him: For the most High hath created him... The most High hath created medicines out of the earth, and a wise man will not abhor them.” The Church was the only institution great enough to de - mand common consideration from all the confused factions that made up medieval life. Unfortunately the Fathers were not ‘health conscious.’ They honored the physician, but they did not inspire him to any general effort to improve the health of his world. To the extremely pious, the doctor was just another cross to bear, in a world of pain and misery. In many instances this attitude could be justified by the gruesome way in which the healing arts were practiced. Paracelsus cried out in the ago - ny of his spirit against barber surgeons and barbarous doctors, in these words: “Fortunate is that man whose physician does not kill him.” Earl y Christian psychology shows how profound was the influence of the decadence and degeneracy of the Romans. The debauchery of the Caesars and the indescribable licentiousness of the aristocracy set up such a revulsion mechanism in the ear - ly Church that it turned against all worldly things, including life itself. In an effort to preserve its followers from the evils of the times, the Church thundered its disapproval of the intem - perance of the flesh, carrying its pronouncements to such an extreme as to violently disturb the normal patterns of living."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"118 Healing, the Divine Art o u R g R e a T m i s f o R T u n e T o b e b o R n To the mind once set in a concept of sin, it is not hard to see faults in the simplest and most natural of habits and customs—”Nothing is either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.” In application, theology saw evil everywhere, because it was thinking of evil. The world was regarded as corrupt in all its parts; the greatest misfortune was to be born into the physi - cal state, and the greatest blessing was to die out of it on one’s natal day. Coinciding with this religious viewpoint was the condition of the world itself. Men had small hope of physical security or happiness during the Dark Ages. Life was a painful ordeal, bur - dened with uncounted woes and hopeless to the end. Sickness and poverty were universal, and tyranny rested cruelly upon all. Those who were not carried away by disease or starvation, died on the field of battle. It is little wonder in such an atmosphere a doctrine of corporeal misery and incorporeal bliss flourished. It was inevitable that men should dream of death as liberation, to regard it desirable to leave this world behind. In a sorrowing sphere, sorrow became the virtue of the hour. To the medieval Christian it was dangerous to be happy, for joy might cause the mind to forget the sordid fact of ever pres - ent temptation, and might also lead into actions which would result in sin. It seemed obvious that the longer a man lived the greater would be his opportunity and temptation to make mistakes and commit wrong deeds. With his eternal salvation depending upon his faultless behavior in this life, the sooner he left the mortal world the better. In addition to these negative considerations, the Church ad - vanced a very positive reason why it was not fortunate to live long.

Under a doctrine which taught that all misfortunes were sent by God, and must be borne without complaint and without sin, there was a com - pleteness about things, with no change needed, and no correc - tion. St. Alphonsus was a man of such extreme piety that Pope Pius the vii desired to possess as relics the three fingers of his right hand. These were the fingers that held the pen with which he wrote down his inspired thoughts. St. Alphonsus lived to great age, but his health was always poor; and for many years he suffered his physical pains with patience and humility. His words are regarded as expressing the highest form of Christian teaching on such matters as health. “We must be particularly resigned,” he wrote, “under the pressure of corporeal infirmi - ties, and we must embrace them willingly both in such a man - ner and for such a time as God wills. Nevertheless we ought to employ the usual remedies, for this is what the Lord wills also, but if they do us no good, let us unite ourselves to the will of God, and this will do us much more good than health. ‘Oh, Lord,’ let us then say, ‘I have no wish either to get well or remain sick: 1 will only that which thou dost will.” o b e d i e n c e T o d o c T o R a n d T o g o d Miracles resulting from prayer indicated that God in his wisdom was moved to relieve the suffering of certain persons.

Medicine, on the other hand, sanctified to a lesser degree, might cope with the ailment; then if a cure re - sulted, it was to be understood that God had effected the work through the physician. To again quote St. Alphonsus, when a doctor had prescribed for him; “If I take your medicine, it is because obedience to you is obedience to God.” There was no place in the medieval world for any form of metaphysical healing outside of the Church, and there was very little need for separate healing cults. Those who sought for health through prayer and meditation could fulfill their mystic longings in the cathedrals, churches, and shrines of their faith. Or, if they chose to trust themselves to the physicians, these were available at a price; and their remedies, if not effective, were certainly sensational. Funds permitting, there could even be, then as now, a consultation of tasseled medics. There was, however, a thin fringe of unorthodox magical- medicine, a fringe that was to grow so long and heavy that eventually it wagged the garment. The poor had little hope of medicine from the elegant physicians who served nobility; and under the feudal system, even less hope of buying expensive remedies like the Pissasphaltos mumie; they had to depend upon simple home-made remedies. So the lowly and the poor followed the little path that led to the edge of the village, where some old ‘widow-woman’ held forth medicinally amid bunches of dangling herbs. The lonely and old had a hard time in those days, and if their skill permitted, they would trade in simples, nurse the sick, and deal in charms and philters. Respectable doctors usu - ally had a stuffed crocodile to adorn their reception rooms, but the ‘widow-women’ could not afford such grandeur; so they hung up a dead owl or bat instead. This is all very childish in the light of our present day, but in the thirteenth century the smallest circumstance took on an air of significance."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Healing During the Rise of the Christian Church 121 It seems that these old herbalists, at least on some occa - sions, gained considerable fame for their remedies, and persons of consequence came to consult them. It would then not be long before the robed physician appeared upon the scene in high dudgeon. His personal reactions were precisely those of the modern practitioner should his best paying patient desert him for the local naturopath. But the medieval doctor was not to be outwitted by a ‘widow-woman’; he promptly accused her of being in league with the devil; and the temper of the times accomplished the rest. T h e e R a o f w i T c h c R a f T European civilization of the Middle Ages was overshadowed by the most sinister Creature ever fabricated by the human mind—the devil. For centuries this monstrous hallucination ruled supreme in Christendom, blocking the normal growth of human thinking.

No one ventured out at night because anyone of a host of evil spirits might be lurking under doorsteps and around dark corners. In some of the old churches carved imps peered out from under the pews, and a man was not safe from harm even while he prayed before the altar. These spirits were not at all kindly sprites, like the nymphs and dryads of classical mythology; the demons of medieval imagining were all horrible, soul-devouring monsters; and the poor rustics huddled close to each other, in their cots and hovels, their teeth chattering with fear every time a gust of wind shook the eaves or muttered in the chimney pots.

Solemnly warned to be ever watch - ful of temptation, men finally reached a condition of the mind that caused them to see temptation everywhere. The devil became a mental reality, whose very form could be conjured up by the imagination at the slightest provocation. Shadows took demon forms.

Personal fear, exaggerated by the common terror, brought •\t out the least desirable part of human nature. Each man feared his neighbor, and all men feared any person whose knowledge was greater than their own.

No civilization has ever reached maturity without some persons being born into it with mediumis - tic powers, varying degrees of clairvoyance, and the ability to hear voices or predict events.

It is reasonable to believe that the percentage was high of vic - tims of personal animosity and cupidity. How were the medical sciences faring during those long years of witchcraft and demonology? There is nothing to indi - cate that things went particularly well with any branch of the sciences. If the physician managed to pacify the Church, and dodge the wrath of the Universities, he still had the devil and pub - lic opinion at his heels.

That brought on open warfare between the conscientious doctor and the unscru - pulous apothecary. In an emergency of this kind the apothecary usually accused the physician of being in league with the devil. When this rumor was spread through the town, the populace, including many of the doctor’s own patients, turned on the physician, pelted him with rocks and filth from the streets, and forced him to leave town. It required considerable fortitude to practice medicine under such conditions. T h e c a u s e s o f P l a g u e s The Church and state were deep in theories, but the doc - tor had to face facts that were the direct result of false theo - ries. For centuries, Europe was afflicted periodically by waves of the bubonic plague. Whole regions were depopulated and every medical facility was taxed to the limit. Thousands of doc - tors themselves died of the plague, which spread like wildfire through the towns and villages. It was useless for the medieval medic to preach sanitation; the plague was generally regard - ed as a religious calamity. The faculty of the Paris College of Medicine was of the opinion that the plague was the result of a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn over the Indian Ocean, but the wiser heads were agreed that the devil was the real cause.

This newly developed power of observation resulted in a gradual rift between the Church and the sciences. By the fifteenth century the devil had lost considerable ground. Its existence was still acknowledged by the majority; but to the enlightened minority the Prince of Darkness was slowly passing into the condition of a myth. But if Satan had lost his power over the minds of the thoughtful, his botheration value in the field of learning can scarcely be overestimated. When the physicians in a certain town decided that a nearby swamp was the cause of a local epi - demic, the local clergy was equally certain that the devil was to blame. To arbitrate this dilemma, the physicians came to the conclusion that the swamp was the direct cause of the fever, but the devil was the direct cause of the swamp. The final cure for ignorance is knowledge. About 1440 , Gutenberg of Mainz invented the printing press. According to some of his contemporaries, Gutenberg employed the devil as his first printer, and the Prince of Demons assisted person - ally in the publication of the great Bible. Regardless of this, the printing press was the greatest single force in bringing the world out of the Middle Ages. But it was also necessary to break forever the power of scho - lasticism. At the University of Basel, Paracelsus burned the writings of Galen and Avicenna in a public ceremony. The old era of empirical medicine was closing. Already Leonardo da Vinci was performing dissection for the purposes of art, and a few years later Andreas Vesalius published his great textbook of human anatomy. Nothing could stop the forward motion."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"128 Healing, the Divine Art P a R a c e l s u s , T h e m y s T i c d o c T o R Paracelsus of Hohenheim, burner of the textbooks, was the greatest metaphysical physician in the history of Europe. Theo - phrastus Paracelsus was born in 1493, the year after Columbus discovered the West Indies. His father was a physician, and in medicine and the letters the young man received the benefits of a University education, if the system of teaching then in vogue could be said to bestow any benefits. After he had finished with the schools, the young doctor began his real medical education. One of the happy circumstances that was to mould his charac - ter was a journey to Constantinople where he was able to study with the Moslem physicians. It is not often that a serious student of the sciences is also a man of action, but these two extremes were dramatically mingled in the personality of the man who called himself “Paracelsus”—to indicate that he vastly excelled the Greek phi - losopher Celsus, His contemporaries described Paracelsus as rough, uncouth, bombastic, and fanatically egocentric. He was not attractive in appearance, and made no effort to develop an engaging manner. He preferred arguments to discussions, and liked nothing better than an opportunity to insult important scholastics. Paracelsus traveled extensively and was particularly interest - ed in the healing lore of gypsies, witches, herbalists, and alche - mists. He studied astrology and demonism, talismanic magic, and the Cabala. He was interested in sympathetic medicine and magnetism, and is said to have had a piece of the mysteri - ous alchemical magisterium , Azoth, in the hilt of his sword.

The books of Parace1sus were dictated to his disciples, and published, not in the medieval Latin of the school-men, but in low German, so that all who could read their native tongue could study the problem of health. To the horror of the other professors he also lectured in German, considering it more important to be understood than to be impressive. For these heresies, and the even greater sin of being successful in his han - dling of diseases that had never before responded to treatment, Paracelsus earned for himself the undying gratitude of suffer - ing humankind, and the equally undying hatred of his fellow doctors. At last, the respectable and self-righteous physicians could stand no more of the rabble-rouser who announced publicly that the soft down on the back of his neck knew more about the healing arts than all the doctors of Europe put together. To this insult he added the further injury of taking difficult cases, solemnly pronounced as incurable by the most learned savants, and restoring the sufferers to health. It is sometimes said that Parace1sus was killed in a brawl, but it has been my privilege to examine various old books and manuscripts, and they are unanimous in stating that in 154 1 the great physician was mur - dered by a professional assassin in the hire of the jealous and vindictive doctors. Despite his magic and his mysticism, Paracelsus is honored today as a great pioneer of medicine; but scientific men who revere his name seldom study the metaphysical methods which were the real basis of his greatness. Paracelsus, the first doctor of the modern world, was like most of those who have led men to the truth, a mystic and a seer."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"130 Healing, the Divine Art T h e P R o T e s T a n T R e f o R m a T i o n A vital factor in the development of modern metaphysical healing was the Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth cen - tury. Even now, after four hundred years, it is difficult to fully estimate the consequence of this upheaval within the body of the Christian faith. The Protestant reformers not only decen - tralized the power of the religion, they altered the entire form of worship; additionally, they carved out entirely new sects, dominated by new viewpoints and separated by a confusion of contrary doctrines. Like most who desire emancipation from tyrannical forms, these Protestants immediately set up tyrannies of their own. In their zeal they were guilty of nearly every fault with which they had stigmatized the elder Church. Again it was not a mat - ter of sincerity, but of basic inability to meet the challenge of progress. When Calvin caused Servetus to be burned at the stake over a theological squabble, it is hard to reconcile such an action with the Protestants’ claim that he was seeking the free - dom to worship God according to the dictates of conscience. Or perhaps it was conscience itself that lay at the root of the trouble. In any event, the Reformation did not end bigotry; it only started a number of smaller bigotries, and began a motion toward separation that resulted in hundreds of arbitrary cults, with little of friendliness for each other. Puritanism worked a serious hardship upon the psycho- emotional part of human nature, by depriving it of partici - pation in the pageantry of religion. The grandeur, pomp and glory of the Church was lost to those who left to find their own way of faith. Gone was the Infallibility of the Popes, gone were the Princes of the Church in their scarlet robes, gone were the Gregorian Chants and the mass, gone were the great cathedrals with their rose windows of priceless glass, gone were absolution and the confessional, and gone was the Apostolic Succession."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Healing During the Rise of the Christian Church 131 All this was swept from the life of the Protestant, and noth - ing of solemn beauty was put in its place.

These pages are concerned rather with the psychological results of depriving the human consciousness of religious ceremonial and symbolism, and of the emotional exaltation which comes from participation in such rites. Puritanism chose to take an attitude of extreme austerity. Beauty found no place in its early concepts. Everything reli - gious became drab and colorless. The new churches were most - ly barren and shabby; the virtuous dressed in somber black and developed a dour and stubborn devotion to the jots and tittles. Martin Luther had thrown his ink pot at the devil while trans - lating the Bible into German. The Prince of Evil was still on the job, and never had the medieval Church worked him harder than did the Protestants. After Jonathan Edwards finished one of his sulphurous sermons in old New England, a deacon came up to him and said, “Dr. Edwards, is there any hope for any of us?” If the Latin sermons of the Middle Ages were meaning, less to the unlearned, the English sermons of the eighteenth cen - tury were equally meaningless to the informed. Stolid men in square-toed shoes sat for hours on rough benches and listened to various divines who denounced every human impulse as infernally inspired.

There was no place for mysticism in those neat little red brick churches, shaded with stately elms, where kindly clergymen preached trite ser - mons from well-loved verses of the scriptures. Great orators like Henry Ward Beecher and DeWitt Talmadge drew admiring throngs, and evangelists of the caliber of Dwight Moody and Charles Spurgeon converted thousands. But these men were untouched by that mystical divinity which comes to those, who like Francis of Assisi, preached their sermons to the birds. Nor was there any place for metaphysics in the distant vaulted temples of science, where mathematical-minded physi - cists pondered the plane of the continuum. Charles Darwin and Thomas Huxley ruled supreme in the empire of the mind, and with all the material world to explore, there was no time for vagaries of the spirit. The rise of mystical organization in the modern scheme of life is the direct result of three centuries of Protestant Christi - anity and a hundred years of materialistic science. The spirit force at the root of things cannot be denied. Blocked by the or - ganized literalism of both religion and science, the metaphysi - cal energies in human consciousness were to break through the intellectual barriers men had set up, and create new channels that the old truths should not die.

Andrew Jackson Davis talked with spirits from the other side of death, and learned from them the mysteries of the Summerland. A little later, H.P.

Men who have discovered the answers to their questions will seek no further; but those who have not found what they need will go on searching, and no power in heaven or earth can stop them. The same holds true in the field of medicine. The various non-medical schools of healing survive and flourish only be - cause a great number of men and women are dissatisfied with the theories and practices of orthodox physicians. Instead of trying to understand the reasons for this popular trend, the medical powers-that-be merely thunder their disapproval, and use every means at hand to prohibit the practice of non-medical healing.

For the same reasons none relish being included with several rival sects in any literary pattern. As it is no desire of mine to breed dissension or cause unhappiness among the metaphysicians, it has seemed expedient to classify the various systems of healing according to the methods employed, rather than by names or claims. For comparative purposes, metaphysical medicine can be arranged under four general headings; occult healing, mystical healing, mental healing, and physical healing. In some cases more than one method is employed by a group or practitioner; whenever this occurs the combination should be separated into its basic parts and each considered under it, proper heading. 5 Modern Healing Cults"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Modern Healing Cults 137 In Europe and America most healing cults are nominally Christian, but the technique which they use may be derived from ancient pagan or modern Asiatic sources. As metaphysical healing has been practiced with equal success by nearly all the great religious systems of the world, there is nothing to indicate that one faith has ever been favored above another in power to heal the sick. If miracles seem to be more frequent among non- Christian peoples, it is because the religious spirit is more vital with them than with us. o c c u l T h e a l i n g Occultism is the ancient science which deals with the hid - den forces of nature, the laws governing them, and the means by which such forces can be brought under the control of the enlightened human mind. An occultist is one who believes in the reality of esoteric sci - ences, has studied them in a scholarly manner, has resolved to perfect his own consciousness according to their rules, and may, or may not, be able to practice the rituals and formulas of Transcendental Magic. The occult sciences are the secret teachings of the World Sav - iors, prophets, seers, sages, and initiated philosophers, with which they instructed their most intimate disciples. This body of esoteric tradition has descended to the present time through the medium of secret religious societies, which therefore are in possession of a most sacred and peculiar knowledge of extra- physical energies, faculties, functions, and powers. The most important of the occult sciences are magic, de - monism, exorcism, alchemy, cabala, astrology and other forms of divination, spiritism, magnetism, esoteric cosmogony, and anthropology, the metaphysical physiology of man, and the extra-sensory perceptions."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"138 Pythagoras Pythagoras of Samos was initiated into fourteen different schools of esoteric religious philosophy and treated disease by reading to patients certain verses from Homer's Odyssey; he also advised the study of higher mathematics for those who were mentally or physi- cally unfit.

He must be acquainted with all of the important systems of world philosophy and reli - gion, both Eastern and Western, and he must have a thorough understanding of ancient sciences and arts. There is no place for the superficial thinker in this field; and should he wander in by accident, it would be wise for him to depart in haste. According to the rules of occultism, all particulars must be suspended from universal principles. In the case of healing, any particular cure must bear witness to some general philosophical pattern; that is, it must be explainable in terms of the relation - ship between the macrocosm and the microcosm—between the universe and man. Strangely enough, there is no place for miracles in the sci - ences of Magic. Occultism defines a miracle as an effect, the cause of which is unknown; but the cause must be equal to the effect which it produces. Knowledge is power, and esoteric knowledge bestows the larger power which appears miraculous to the uninformed. The great occultist Paracelsus said, “The be - ginning of wisdom is the beginning of supernatural powers.” Buddha taught that the universal disease of mankind was ignorance, and wisdom the only remedy. This statement sums up, exactly, the attitude of the occultist. It is his conviction that the world is ruled by absolute and immutable laws; to know them is to be wise, to keep them is to be happy, and to break them is to die. Many of these laws are unknown to materi - al scientists, whose faculties are not developed to explore the fourth-dimensional vistas of spirit-space; but it is through such strange laws and knowledge of them that so-called miracles are produced.

Occultism does not teach that good health is the natural birthright of man. Health is reserved for those who KNOW how to live, and have the courage to live what they know. The ignorant can never be well, for cured of one ailment they im - mediately fall victim to another. Health, like happiness, must be earned. Those who would enjoy either, must set the proper causes in motion. Many of the systems of occult medicine practiced in ancient times are without apologists in the modern world, but such as seem likely to be revived I will include in the present survey. For some reason difficult to understand, the greatest of all classical institutions of healing, the Oracles of Asclepius, have no counterpart in present society, and the entire field of dream therapy is ignored. Pythagoras of Samos ( 6th century bc ) was initiated into fourteen different schools of esoteric religious philosophy. He traveled as far as India, and was accepted into the Brahman Mysteries at Ellora and Elephanta. He is the only non-Hindu ever to be so honored. In his school at Crotona, Pythagoras taught certain of his more advanced disciples the systems of occult healing practiced by the priests of various Eastern and near-Eastern cults. Pythagoras treated disease by reading to patients certain verses from Homer’s Odyssey , but whether it was the words of the poem or the voice of the master that possessed healing pow - er is not recorded. This Samian sage also advised the study of higher mathematics for those who were mentally or physically unfit, because contemplation of the orderly sequences of num - bers would subdue the intemperate impulses of the soul and body. It may be interesting to note that Emanuel Swedenborg is said to have become clairvoyant as the result of his addiction to arithmetic problems."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"142 Healing, the Divine Art The researches of Pythagoras in the therapeutic effect of music were revived after the First World War, and experiments were made with men suffering from so-called shell shock. The results were sufficiently positive to arouse considerable interest, and the subject is still under consideration. Greek music was composed according to modes, and the Archon of Athens had enough faith in the occult power of the musical composition that a man could be exiled as an enemy of the state should he write a song in the wrong mode. The Pythagoreans were probably the first to experiment in color therapy, from the principle that it was possible to be fed through the eyes. From the same premise, they exposed various symmetrical geometric solids to the gaze of the sick, in order that the soul might benefit from the harmonizing influence of perfect proportion. This last method they had learned from the Egyptians. Perfumes, incense, and various magical fumigations were also used for healing purposes. These were compounded with the greatest of care, and the odors were believed to pass through the nostrils directly to the brain. It is now known that the pi - tuitary body is especially sensitive to fragrances, so further re - search along this line might be profitable. A French perfumer has created what he calls a scale of odors, similar to a musical scale, and claims to be able to compose harmonic perfumes by this means. Astro-diagnosis and astro-therapy have been practiced for thousands of years, and prior to the middle of the eighteenth century most physicians made use of astrology. Even Lord Ba - con allowed that plagues could be predicted from the motions of the stars, and it is reported of him that he fainted whenever there was an eclipse of the moon. Rene Descartes was no con - vert to the art, but he grudgingly admitted that astrology could not be disproved."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Modern Healing Cults 143 Upon the authority of Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna, medieval astrologer-physicians developed an elaborate system of correspondences between the planets and herbs, chemicals, and mineral medicines. They administered these according to rules of sympathy and antipathy, and judged the disease by the afflicting planet and its aspects. Diseases of Saturn were offset with remedies of Jupiter, and critical days were determined by the moon. Seventeenth century England produced several important writers and practitioners along lines of astrological medicine. Dr. William Lilly, Dr. Nicholas Culpeper, and Dr. Henry Co - ley were the most famous of this group, and these men enjoyed the patronage of Sir Elias Ashmole, to whom some of their as - trological books were dedicated, with permission. An interesting phase of astro-diagnosis was the old practice of setting up a horoscope for the exact minute when a sample of the patient’s urine was taken to the doctor. This enabled the physician to select me proper remedies to take with him when he visited me sick person.

It has been my privilege to know some of these men, and study closely the work they are doing. They should not be confused with the gentleman who was selling chips off the Philosopher’s Stone a few years ago. The Cabala is the secret doctrine of Israel, descended by oral tradition through the priesthood, from Moses the great Lawgiver. During the Middle Ages, both Jewish and Christian scholars were deep in cabalistic speculation about the origin of the universe, the letters of the Sacred Name, and the hierar - chies of the blessed and infernal angels. The Sepher ha Zohar, the Book of the Splendors , has only recently been available in the English language. This is the great text of the Cabala, and those who wish to study the subject should accept no other authority. Popular numerology is not Cabalism.

The French occultist, Abbe Louis Constant (Eli - phas Levi) invoked the spirit of Apollonius of Tyanna for Lady Bulwer-Lytton with the aid of Cabalistic spells. Ceremonial Magic is mentioned here because it taught that spirits and de - mons could be called upon to heal disease and prolong life. The Rosicrucian physicians of the seventeenth century com - bined alchemy, astrology, the Cabala, and magic in their secret system of therapy. Among the doctors of the Rosy Cross should be mentioned Robert Fludd, Michael Maier and John Heydon. In his Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum, Elias Ashmole notes that a Rosicrucian physician was able to cure the young Duke of Norfolk of the leprosy. Some modern Rosicrucian move - ments include healing among their activities, but the methods used do not necessarily relate to the theories of the old order. m a g n e T i c h e a l i n g Magnetic healing was known to the Egyptians, Greeks, and Hindus, and was practiced by them in remote times. The sorceresses of Thessaly treated the sick with metal rods called fingers , and the Chinese highly valued amber for its magnetic qualities. Later, in Europe, the lodestone was held in similar esteem. Magnetic healing and animal magnetism were revived in the eighteenth century as the result of the experiments of Anton Mesmer with his celebrated tub.

The belief that, in the matter of health, those who have de - parted from this life can be of assistance to the living, is a very old doctrine that has survived to modern times. This is spiritistic healing, and a medium is usually consulted who will attempt to contact some decarnate intelligence to gain the knowledge nec - essary to prescribe the proper remedy. This procedure is based upon the belief that the dead who have already passed into the spirit world have discovered secrets about the hidden side of nature, beyond the knowledge of the living. Persons naturally sensitive to psychic impressions may at - tempt to communicate directly with some guide on the inner planes without recourse to a professional medium. Several cases have come to my attention of persons who received instructions in healing and solutions to their own health problems from entities which they contacted by mediumistic means. Widely accepted among modern metaphysicians is the an - cient belief in the reality of certain superhuman beings called Initiates and Masters. A number of sects have arisen which in - volve these Adepts in their methods of healing. Adepts are such disciples of the occult sciences as have attained to great knowl - edge and power, and have been initiated into the secret schools of the esoteric wisdom. In India these Initiates are called Ma - hatmas, and are supposed to abide in remote places far from the habitations of ordinary mortals.

There are a number of Hindus and a few other Asiatic teach - ers of metaphysics in this country who include philosophies of healing among their doctrines. Most of these Orientals com - bine diet, exercise, and rhythmic breathing with their occult forms of treatment. The power of the mind over the body is emphasized, and various esoteric disciplines are taught. This group holds the general view that the ailments of the body can be corrected by purifying the system and increas - ing the spiritual energies through meditation and the practice of the Yogas. Mantras, the Hindu hymns which proclaim the inseparability of the gods, monads, and atoms are also used by these cults; and in their teachings obscure references are made to the kundalini, the universal life-principle which everywhere manifests in Nature. As there is little organization among these Oriental teachers, it is very difficult to give an adequate sum - mary of their methods. The diagnosis and treatment of disease by the study of the aura, or magnetic emanations of the human body, was prac - ticed by the priests of the old Mystery cults. The Kilner Screen, invented by Walter J. Kilner, ba, mb , cantab., mrcp , etc., late electrician at St. Thomas’ Hospital, London, has now brought this subject within the field of physical scientific research. Dr. Kilner was able to devise for those without clairvoyant train - ing a simple method of stimulating the human eye so that it is capable of seeing auras.

Indicative of the trends arc these: The possibility of capturing the rays of the planets in dew; research in the Dru - idic lore of the mistletoe, as a medium for the astral light; and investigation into the crystals formed in human blood, by the process of drying. Diagnosis by divination has also been widely practiced. That eccentric genius, Jerome Cardan, wrote a book on the occult significance of moles on the body, and in the lines of the forehead. The late Count Louis Hamon (Cheiro) told me that he could tell the condition of a person’s health by the lines on the hands and the condition and shape of the finger nails. The Chinese can accurately predict the number of children a woman will bear, from the small lines in the corners of her eyes; and they will also determine the length of life from the angle of the cheek bones. All such methods belong to the general field of the occult sciences, because if they are true, they bear witness to laws operating in the body of man. An occult healer is a person learned in all the obscure arts and philosophies which bear upon the health of man. His ways may seem strange to the uninformed, but the practice of meta - physical medicine is justified by thousands of years of tradition and sanctified by the veneration of ages. m y s T i c a l h e a l i n g Mysticism may be academically defined as the belief that the direct knowledge of God and Truth is possible to man through an extension of his spiritual insight toward union with the sub - stance and essence of Divinity.

A mystic may, or may not, believe in a personal God. To most Christian mystics, Deity is to some degree personal, capa - ble of likes and dislikes, and able to hear and answer the prayers of the faithful. Among Oriental mystics the Divine Nature is usually regarded as impersonal, and is adored as the Universal Reality, to be glorified rather than supplicated. The mystical arts are the traditional disciplines by which the human consciousness is brought into a state of attunement with the World Spirit. These disciplines are largely derived from the lives and teachings of great mystics who are known to have achieved the Cosmic Consciousness. The popular mysticism practiced in modern metaphysical movements has been called ‘the heart doctrine,’ and the fol - lowers of these cults are taught to live from day to day with the emotion of ‘Divine Love’ uppermost in their conscious - ness. Unfortunately, the average student of these subjects has no comprehension of the meaning of the words “Divine Love,” and he can only assume that they signify a sublimated kind of human affection. He therefore tries to love God as he might try to love another human being, and the result is anything but true mysticism. It is difficult to define in words a spiritual process that has no equivalent in the outer life of mankind. Brother Lawrence defined mysticism as “the practice of the presence of God.” This is a noble statement, and certainly inclines the mind in the direction of mystical conviction; but it is not the complete definition. Perhaps we can add, mysticism is participation in the divine nature of being . Participation means to share in common, or to partake of, a substance, quality, or action. There can be no true mysticism without this becoming aware in God. The practice of the mystical disciplines must result ultimate - ly in the attainment of the mystical state. A strange enthusiasm"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"150 Healing, the Divine Art (from the Greek enthousiazein , to be possessed by a god), rises up and fills the consciousness of the mystic, and he is obsessed by a powerful ecstatic emotion of exaltation or rapture. While thus transported he feels himself one with God, and a part of all that lives. As the mystic becomes more sensitive to the sympathies present everywhere in nature, it is ever more difficult for him to resist the emotional or mystical content of life about him. Dante could not gaze upon an open rose without being so com - pletely overcome by its beauty that he lost human conscious - ness in an ecstasy of exquisite pain. The great East Indian saint and mystic Sri Ramakrishna, spent many hours of each day in rapturous contemplation of the Motherhood of God. In the last years of his life, Ramakrishna could not think or speak of the Beloved Mother of the World without passing into Samadhi, the superconscious state. When this mood came upon him, it was necessary for his disciples to support his body, to prevent him from falling to the ground. The earlier forms of Christian mysticism were largely domi - nated by the emotion of suffering. Men sought to come nearer to Christ by experiencing his pain. This was the mysticism of participation through agony. The exquisite sweetness of great pain in Christ, led to the extreme austerities and physical dis - ciplines of the Monks and Fathers of the Church. “Oh! how sweet it is,” cried St. Alphonsus, “to suffer and die, embracing the cross.” Modern mystics seldom go to the extreme of Sufi or Der - vish ecstasy; they are satisfied to follow along the ways of prayer and faith. They believe that God is truly an ever present help in time of trouble, and turn to Him whenever pain or sorrow comes to them. The one really mystical attitude of these people is their firm conviction that Deity can be reached by personal appeal."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Modern Healing Cults 151 Mystical healing , in practice, is most often faith healing, and depends for its accomplishment upon the stimulating of the faith content in human nature, and the psychological and bio - logical results of sincere conviction upon the functional pro - cesses and organic structure of the body. Through faith, the power of God is released in the human chemistry to work its wonders and renew the life of the flesh. The mystical healing of the Catholic Church is closely as - sociated with venerated shrines, holy relics, and sacred images. Through pilgrimage to sanctified places and meditation upon the symbols and objects of faith, the chemistry of the body may be profoundly influenced. Modern scientists are inclined to believe that the healing resulting from faith are psychological rather than spiritual, but they admit that results are obtained in cases where the doctor fails. Of the mystical healing at Lourdes in France, and St. Anne de Beaupre in Canada, Dr. Howard writes: “Relics and shrines cure today as they did in medieval times. Modern physicians even have sent some of their patients to be thus treated. All diseases due to hysteria or to melancholy states of mind are susceptible to such cures. Even men and women suffering from incurable diseases are temporarily improved by the hope that is inspired in them.” Dr. Alexis Carrel is reported to have been converted to the Catholic faith as the result of seeing a cancer wither away and fall off a man’s hand in a few moments at the shrine of Lourdes. It would therefore appear that faith can work miracles beyond the mere improvement of morbid psychological attitudes. The power of holy relics and the intercession of the saints are sustained from the words of the Scriptures. According to Acts 5, xv, xvi , the shadow of St. Peter cured the sick, and it is recorded in Acts 19, xii, that cloths that had touched the body of St. Paul had the power to restore health."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"152 Healing, the Divine Art It is therefore upon the authority of the words of Christ, and the testimony of the Disciples, that faith healing is practiced also by the protestant Christian denominations and metaphysi - cal Christian sects. It is widely believed by these organizations that the spiritual curing of disease is possible to those who have a complete and abiding faith in Christ and his ministry. Other religions hold a similar belief, regarding their Prophets and Saviors, and examples of faith healing resulting from sincere conviction of the healing power of God are to be found in all parts of the world. To effect a healing by faith it is usually necessary to inten - sify the religious emotions of the sufferer in one of several ways. Faith healing in the orthodox Christian sects is frequently part of evangelistic revivals, during which the evangelist works upon the emotions of the audience until a condition approaching cri - sis or ecstasy is produced. Religious healers most often work against a background of this emotional intensity. Many religious organizations teach the value of direct prayer in the curing of bodily ailments. The sufferer may pray himself, or the prayers may be said on his behalf by a priest or clergy - man. It is also common for a group or congregation to unite their prayers on behalf of a sick person. It is also a Christian be - lief that prayers may be addressed to Deity asking help for the sick by anyone of sincere and devout mind; and men may pray for the health of each other, and for those dear to them. When respected national leaders are stricken it is usual for congrega - tions of all denominations to unite in prayers for the recovery of such outstanding men. Healing by the laying on of hands is a very ancient form of mystical therapy, and has been widely practiced among Chris - tian religious groups. The healer has usually believed himself to possess a spiritual power derived from God, which he is able to communicate to other persons by touching their heads or the affected parts of their bodies with his hands. By this contact,"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Modern Healing Cults 153 the spiritual virtue passes into the sufferer, accomplishing a cure by the direct power of God. Laying on of hands is some - times confused with magnetic healing, but the two methods are entirely different in basic principle. It has always seemed to me that the great power of faith lies in the changes that it can bring about in our living and thinking. When a man is converted to some religious belief by the conviction of his own consciousness, the mental, emo - tional, and physical parts of his nature are all profoundly af - fected. Diseases which were the direct or indirect results of the previous patterns of his living and thinking may cease in him, because his new life pattern does not support them. We are all acquainted with the type of doctor who says to his difficult patient, “My good fellow, what you need is a change of air.” Very likely the physician is merely tactfully admitting his desire to terminate relationships with the case. But the advice may be far more sound than it appears. Human beings get into ruts, and these ruts can result in sickness and disease. Many a doctor has had the embarrassing experience of meet - ing on the street a hale and hearty person whose face is vaguely familiar. “Don’t you know me?” beams the stranger, “I’m the chap you told, ten years ago, that he had just six months to l ive.” It then develops that the erstwhile patient was so frightened by the prospect of an early demise that he resolved to get well at all cost. So he went to a ranch in Nebraska and his improve - ment was immediate. The trip to the West and the outdoor life unquestionably did a great deal of good, but there was more to the cure than vigorous living; there was a complete change of outlook, mental and emotional. New faces, other values, and different standards of living, all these played their part. The young man became a new person; and that new person was not subject to the old ailments; so he got well."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"154 Healing, the Divine Art If such changes can be brought about by shifting the per - sonality pattern into a new environment, as much or more can be accomplished by changing the mental and emotional pat - terns. People can become allergic to themselves. The only rem - edy that is appropriate to such cases, is for the individual to change himself. Under certain conditions, religion can bring about this change. An old gentleman once told me that he had cured inflammatory rheumatism by joining a certain church. His friends ridiculed the idea, but it was probably true. Inspired by a new religious zeal, he had earnestly endeavored to mend his moral ways, and his physical health cleared up as a result. m e n T a l h e a l i n g Thousands of years before the advent of Freud, Adler, and Jung, the Witch Doctors of Africa, the Shamans of Asia and America, and the Priest-Physicians of classical Greece, were aware of the psychological factors which influence the lives of human beings. But, because these old occultists involved their knowledge in mystical and metaphysical rites, and used reli - gious and philosophical terms in explaining their conclusions, the entire subject was ignored by modern scientific thinkers, who would not descend from the heights of their smug materi - alism to examine the ‘superstitions’ of the ancients. It therefore remained for the nineteenth century ad to re-discover what the nineteenth millennium bc already understood. A considerable part of psychological lore is still in the keep - ing of religion. In recent years a number of religio-psycholog - ical cults have arisen which are attempting to rescue the spiri - tual values in psychology from the rank materialism of most academic practitioners in the field. It is possible that one of the reasons why scientific psychology has not lived up to the hopes and expectations of its enthusiasts is, that in borrowing its"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Modern Healing Cults 155 its principles from the ancient temples, too much of the reli - gious and philosophical parts of the doctrine were rejected and ignored. Mentalism teaches that the various phenomena of life are of mental origin, that the universe itself is a creation in mind, that the laws of nature originated in the world of thought, and are administered by cosmic intelligence, and that God is the mental, or Intellectual Principle that rules all things, and not a spiritual Being. Mental science is a collective term used by metaphysicians to cover that aspect of spiritual culture by which the individual is improved through personal application of the universal laws governing spiritual thought. It further assumes that mind and not matter is an actual reality, and that the illusion of matter can be controlled by mental power. By this teaching, material life is a false attitude held by a mind which is ignorant of its potential power to dominate all material substances and condi - tions. Mental healing is any form of spiritual-psychological therapy which operates on the principle that the mind can correct the evils of sickness and disease, and restore health by recondition - ing the mental outlook. Mental healing differs from academic psychotherapy in the emphasis that is placed on the spiritual aspect of mind; and in the teaching that spiritual mind is capable of bringing about a state of perfection in the consciousness of the individual. It is important to point out that it is a cardinal tenet of most mental healing cults that health is the natural state of man; sick - ness is the result of the acceptance of mental error . In this respect, the modern doctrine differs widely from the ancient philosoph - ical belief: that sickness and disaster were natural to all mortals, until they perfected their standards of living. To metaphysical mentalists, God, the spiritual mind of the world, desires the health of man, and sickness comes from"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"156 Healing, the Divine Art wrong thinking and not from other spiritual, moral, or physical causes. God wishes all creatures to be healthy and prosperous, but in order to achieve this state, they must realize that this is the Divine Will, and make it their daily task to reaffirm this fact in every thought and action. Mentalism as a religion is represented by a wide variety of sects, each differing from the others in terminology and minor details of procedure, but all agreeing that mind is the origin of happiness and misery, health and sickness, even life and death. A few groups have attempted to prove that it is possible to over - come death, the last great enemy, by setting the mind firmly in the realization of the eternity of life; but to date, none of them has been able to extend man’s existence beyond the usual physical span. A strange contradiction comes into the practices of many of the mentalist sects. While claiming the unreality of mate - rial things, these groups are deeply engaged in accomplishing all that they can of physical success and power. Most mental healing cults seem to include personal unhappiness, marital difficulties, and financial reverses among physical ailments, and treat these problems along with sickness and disease. And, most mental sects are very prosperity conscious, even as they deny the actual existence of the material world. All mental healing is a form of suggestive or auto-suggestive therapy, but some practitioners will not admit this; they insist upon involving its practices in elaborate formulas and meth - ods. Good results are frequently attained, because a person who takes on a more optimistic attitude about himself and his ac - tivities is the one most likely to succeed in life and in business. Also, as we expect a better state of things for ourselves, we are quicker to recognize opportunity and make use of it. The most widely practiced form of mental therapy is healing by affirmation. In metaphysics, an affirmation is a statement of"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Modern Healing Cults 157 spiritual truth intended to overcome a false attitude held in the material mind. It is assumed that sickness has no real existence, but is an illusion resulting from the failure of the individual to preserve the clarity of his spiritual viewpoint. Affirmations are most frequently made by the sufferer him - self, but a practitioner may be consulted to determine the af - firmation most suitable to the immediate problem. Affirmative statements are not addressed to any external agent of healing, but are intended to clarify the realization of personal spiritual sufficiency. Typical affirmations for health are: I am radiantly healthy, and, I am perfect; therefore I cannot be sick· The denial is the reverse of the affirmation. In some groups, instead of a positive statement of health, the negative statement of denial is employed. For example, the patient may say, There is no pain, or my leg does not hurt. In man systems of mental healing, affirmation and denial are used together in a logical sequence. Types of these state - ments include, there is no such thing as disease, therefore I am not sick. And again, I am only sick because I think I am sick. The whole purpose of the statements is to convince the individual himself that what he has accepted as the illness from which he is suffering is only its mental image. A platitude is a general statement of spiritual fact or convic - tion. The platitude is used in healing as the abstract basis for a particular affirmation. It is a moral argument to justify the belief in the therapeutic value of a metaphysical statement of truth. The patient may memorize the platitude himself, or he may have it recited or read to him by a practitioner. The patient can say, God desires all of His creatures to enjoy good health, or all things are perfect in the Divine mind. These are platitudes because they are generalizations, serving to rationalize certain special attitudes concerning the conduct of life. In the field of New Thought, it is held by some, that heal - ing thoughts can be sent to a person at a distance; this is called"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"158 Healing, the Divine Art absent treatment . If the patient is visualized, held in the mind, or thought about intensely, a contact is established regardless of distance and the healing treatment or affirmation will be effec - tive. This method is popular both with individual practitioners and large organizations. The requests for help are written, telegraphed, or phoned to the healer, or group, and the curative vibrations are sent out to meet the need. Large metaphysical-religious orders have departments to handle nothing but requests for healing and related matters. Most of these sects have developed their own special technique in the practice of absent treatment. The ultimate in something or other, is the recent innova - tion of healing by decrees . In this type of mental therapy, the patient or the healer commands the Infinite or its agencies to accomplish the desired cure, immediately and completely. In some cases the power of the decree is intensified by a number of persons decreeing together for the attainment of the purpose. The decrees are usually spoken formulas addressed to some su - perhuman force or being as, I decree for perfect health , or, I de - mand instantaneous healing for my injured foot. There are mental healing sects that do not deny the reality of matter, but teach the development of a dominant personality that can accomplish anything that it wills to do. These folks practice the process of willing for things that they want. Again, this is a method of increasing the courage content in them - selves, in this way to overcome the natural or unnatural limita - tions of their characters. Schopenhauer’s doctrine of the will to power is apparent in these cults and may lead to the production of dictatorial complexes. All who are interested in the power of the mind over the affairs of their lives will do well to remember the words of Py - thagoras, who refused to ask any favors from Divinity because, “All men know what they want, but only the Gods know what they need.”"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Modern Healing Cults 159 Emile Cone’s famous formula, day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better , is an example of mental healing that is not necessarily religious but is simply autosuggestion popular - ized for the masses. One of the most ingenious devices yet to be advanced in this field, is an automatic phonograph which plays suggestive affirmations to the fortunate purchaser while he is asleep. This is based on the belief that the subconscious mind is more recep - tive to impressions while the conscious mind is at rest. Hypnotic therapy belongs in the class of mental healing. It is the technique of creating an artificial receptivity in the mind, so that suggestions for the correction of character defects and functional ailments will be more readily assimilated by the in - tellect. The practice of hypnotic therapy is encouraged in Eu - rope, and recognized as an important branch of psychology, but the entire field is practically ignored in America, due prob - ably, to unfortunate religious prejudices, rooted in a complete misunderstanding of the principles involved. Hypnotism is a mechanical art, and not a spiritual mystery, as so many be - lieve. Students of the processes behind suggestion, or mental heal - ing, should bear in mind the often quoted story of the dyspep - tic farmer who went to the local doctor to get something for his bad stomach. The physician wrote out a prescription and told the man to take it the first thing in the morning. A few days later the patient returned and said that nothing had ever done him so much good. A little adroit questioning revealed that the farmer had not taken the prescription to the druggist to be filled but had eaten the paper itself. P h y s i c a l h e a l i n g It may appear inconsistent to include a consideration of physical healing in a chapter devoted to metaphysical therapy,"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"160 Healing, the Divine Art but it must be remembered that it is quite possible to have re - ligious convictions about absolutely purely physical practices. Most religions have involved themselves in the personal lives of their followers, sometimes with disastrous results. Diet, for example, plays an important part in the spiritual persuasions of many persons. A number of metaphysical sects will not permit their members to eat certain foods, because these are regarded as detrimental to spiritual development. Such restrictions obviously should be applied cautiously, for usually they are entirely arbitrary, and do not take into consid - eration the particular needs of the individual. Vegetarianism was not originally a Christian doctrine; it came to Europe and America from the Orient, where it is prac - ticed by a number of mystic sects, especially the Buddhists. It is not certain that Buddha himself preached a meatless diet, but it is held as necessary to the virtuous life by most of his followers. Buddha is said to have died as the result of eating tainted pork, which was given to him by a poor peasant who could of - fer nothing better to the great teacher whom he dearly loved. The attitude of Buddha on this occasion was, that it is the duty of the Holy Man to accept without question whatever food is given by the sincere, and eat it with gratitude, even though death be the result. This part of the doctrine would simplify life for the hostess who has vegetarians coming in to dinner. Religious organizations may also prescribe the clothing that members shall wear. The style of dress, the color, and the number of garments worn, may be determined by unchanging tradition, or more modern revelations. In many cases, the attire of the sect member is neither artistic nor hygienic, and may be detrimental to health. As the present trend is from prudery to nudity, from the overdressed we can pass to a consideration of the under-dressed. In the freilichparks (free light parks) of Germany before the"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Modern Healing Cults 161 Second World War, nacktkultur (nudism) assumed the propor - tions of a spiritual belief. And it is permissible to regard nudism as a form of spiritual healing, if the devotees of the cult believe in the Divine power of the sun, and agree with the East Indian gymnosophists that the unclothed way is the direct route to God. It is stil1 a moot question as to whether the sexual life of man is a problem in biology or theology; but until the mechan - ics of the immaculate conception have been somewhat simpli - fied, the biologists have an edge in the argument. Celibacy is a very ancient religious practice that may have a profound effect upon the physical life of human beings. Some sects demand complete continence of their members, others permit the sex relationship solely for purposes of propagation. A number of oriental teachers include simple calisthenics and setting up exercises among the disciplines of their cults. So rigorous is the physical culture of the Eastern mystics that few Occidentals are able to assume the correct postures used in Tan - tra and Yoga. Anyone who has sat cross-legged and attempted to hold his body off the ground for an hour by the strength of his arms and hands alone, will realize the tremendous physical endurance that the Asiatic holy men have developed. Because of their spiritual persuasions, metaphysicians are opposed frequently to the entire theory of allopathic medicine. They will not go to doctors, nor will they take drugs, serums, or glandular secretions; and many are opposed to vaccination. Some go so far as to reject surgery, others will permit it if there is no other way to preserve life, but are opposed to minor op - erations, such as removal of tonsils. There is considerable hard feeling between the mystics and the medics, and each group has rather unpleasant opinions of the other.

Electrical and radiomagnetic devices are also accepted as indicating a trend away from drugs. But there is considerable opposition to the use of X-ray for- therapeutic purposes. A medical writer, unhappy over the whole mystical attitude on healing, includes osteopathy among the faith cults, because the founder, Dr. Andrew Still, once said, “God is the Father of osteopathy and I am not ashamed of the child of His mind.” Biochemistry, as developed by Schusler, and later given a metaphysical explanation by Dr. George Carey, with his twelve cell-salts and their zodiacal correspondences, has many follow - ers. With the exception of certain of the mentalists, the mem - bers of the various spiritual groups believe in the sacredness of the human body, and teach that it should be preserved and cared for in every way possible. They emphasize good simple food, proper ventilation, light and non-binding clothes, suffi - cient exercise, sunbaths, hydro-therapy, moderation in all per - sonal habits, the outdoor life, and healthful recreation. To these folks natural living is a religious virtue. While a few go to doubtful extremes in their allegiance to these principles, the majority have a sound and constructive policy in harmony with the best traditions of spiritual and physical culture. 2"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Part Two T H e P H i l O S O P H y OF H ealing"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"165 s o m e f u n d a m e n T a l s The subject now to be de a lt w ith is difficult to present , especially in digest form. Clearest expression demands little or no use of synonyms, for those that could be used are both con - fusing and inexact; the essential words will thus be repeated whenever necessary, for the sake of clarity. According to the doctrines of the occult sciences, the physi - cal body of man is a vehicle for the manifestation of invisible, spiritual energies. These energies not only sustain the body it - self, but flow through it, manifesting as the attitudes, impulses, and functional processes of the outer life. This viewpoint of the old philosophers may be summarized in a definition: Man is a metaphysical being, abiding in the superphysical worlds; he is revealed to our material sense per - ceptions by his physical body, which is the least part of his composite nature. One school of materialistic psychology teaches that thought and emotion arise within the physical body, with individual - ity, character, and temperament being the result of the external pressure of environment and events.

It is not possible to comprehend the principles of occult healing without an understanding of the four-fold constitution of the human being. The personality of man is composed of a mental nature, an emotional nature, a functional nature, and a physical nature. Of these four natures only the physical is visible; but the powers of the remaining three higher natures can be discovered by studying their effects upon the physical nature. The physical body of all living creatures is a mineral organ - ism; of itself it is only a refined kind of stone. According to the Hindu mystics, it is “the hard rock that softened,” described in the Tibetan Book of Dzyan, but still a mineral structure. Consider the composition of man’s physical body—oxygen, 65 percent; carbon, 18 percent; hydrogen, 10 percent; nitrogen, 3 percent; calcium, 2 percent; and phosphorus, 1 percent. The remaining one percent is made up of small quantities of potas - sium, sodium, chlorine, magnesium, iron, iodine, fluorine, and silicon. No matter how these elements are arranged and combined, the occult philosopher contends that the genius of a Leonardo da Vinci, or the mental excellence of a Plato, could not possibly lurk among them. Or, if you combine all the listed chemical el - ements in their correct proportions, the result is not a man, but an inert mass. Is it, then, such a mystical abstraction to believe that the human being is not merely his physical body? Is it not much more reasonable to regard man himself as the intangible power that ensouls the elements, and fashions them into the vehicle of his purposes? The mechanistic school of physics has tried for a long time to prove that the universe and man are self-operating machines,"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"168 Healing, the Divine Art and so there is no need for the hypothesis of a conscious or intellectual principle in nature to explain the mystery of life. But, though machines may be very wonderfully and very skill - fully made, human beings must build them, and human beings must operate them; and when, for any reason, they cease to function, human beings must repair them. For all practical purposes, the human body is a machine, the most perfect machine in all the world. It is capable of almost unbelievable delicacy of function, and is sensitive to every im - pulse of the will, but like all mechanical devices, it is composed of material substances, useless unless directed by intelligence, and inert and powerless unless ensouled by a conscious spirit. m a n ’ s T h R e e i n v i s i b l e b o d i e s Behind the physical form that is visible to the eyes stands man himself, clothed in three intangible but very real bodies of specialized energy. The first of these is composed of mental substance, the stuff that thoughts are made of; the second is composed of emotional substance, the sensitive fabric of feel - ings and desires; the third is composed of vital substance, the functional energy without which physical forms could not en - dure. Man thinks, not with his brain, but through his brain. The brain is but a sensitized area of physical matter which reacts to the subtle impulses of the mental body. In the same way, emotions and functions are communicated to the physical body through the liver and the spleen, and these organs are but distributors of specialized impulses, and not the originators of these impulses. Nothing originates in the body but inertia. All Its activity is communicated to it from one of the zones of metaphysical energy. It is for this reason that the ancients did not refer to the physical body as a principle, but as a receptacle of principles.

The “personality” of the solar system, the sun, with the group of celestial bodies which revolve round it, is composed of four kinds of substance; mental substance, emotional sub - stance, functional substance, and physical substance. In the solar system these spheres of substance are called planes, and together, these make up the personality of the solar God. These four strata are the four worlds of the philosophical Cabala, and it was in the substance of these four worlds that the four Adams came into being. Man has a body to correspond with each of the planes of nature. Each of these bodies of man is composed of the sub - stance of the plane in which it originated. It grows and develops in that plane, it is subject to the laws governing that plane, and ultimately it disintegrates back into the basic matter of that plane. These four bodies are the four Adams, and the physical body is the last Adam, the one that fell into matter and put on the coat of skins. It may be a little difficult to realize that the mind is re - ally a body, and not merely a strange, vague emptiness with thoughts floating about in it. Our way of thinking has long ac - cepted things as material only if we can contact them with our sense perceptions. Yet we know that the five senses of man are only at the beginning of their development, and many very real things are beyond present sensory range. There are innumer - able sounds that the human ear cannot hear, colors and forms that the human eye cannot see, flavors that the human taste cannot register, odors that the human sense of smell cannot detect, and substances so refined that they cannot be felt by the human sense of touch. Only in recent years has science come to a realization of the limitations of man’s sensory perceptions, recognized the possibility of the substance and reality of things unseen."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Esoteric Physiology 171 T h e h u m a n a u R a The physical body of man and the superphysical bodies which sustain it are shown in their proper relationship to each other in the figure on page 166 . To the trained clairvoyant, the higher bodies b, c, and d, are visible as fields of light; they make up what is commonly called the aura. The ancients referred to this aura as an “invisible perspiration,” because it seemed to be emanating from the physical form. In actuality, the only part of the aura that comes from the material body is the etheric sheath b. The emotional and men - tal auras c and d are magnetic fields of energy that flow toward the body, and are involved in its functions through the medium of the etheric sheath. e represents an energy field that has not yet been differenti - ated into a body, but which will become the vehicle of man’s spiritual nature when this has been perfected by the processes of evolution. f is the circumference of personal existence, the shell of the auric egg, in which the human creature lives, and moves, and has his being.

This"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"172 Healing, the Divine Art is the true explanation of the four humours of Hippocrates. The modern physicist defines ether as a postulated medium for the transmission of light waves; but to the occultist the ethers are the secret of all function and growth. The ethers, physical in their origin, are actually the subtler parts of matter. The etheric emanations of the earth itself fill the inner atmosphere of the planet, so that, as Thales expressed it, the earth seems to float in an humid vapor, a thinned-out or attenuated water. This etheric humidity is invisible to the physical perceptions, but may be examined by those possessing etheric sight. When seen, it resembles a slightly luminous thin haze, dimly stratified. Its lower parts are placid and unchang - ing, but its upper layers are in a state of constant agitation. Close to the earth, and about the bodies of living things, the etheric haze is more pronounced, and shines with a greenish- blue light. This light surrounds minerals, plants, animals and human beings with glistening halos. The etheric emanations from the lower kingdoms are not so brilliant as are those of man. T h e f o u R e T h e R s The four ethers and the parts they play in the economy of human life are as follows: Physical or chemical ether , the form binder. Functional or vital ether, the energy binder. Emotional or psychical ether , the impulse binder. Mental or intellectual ether, the thought binder. These ethers have laws governing them, and have qualities inherent in their natures which every metaphysical healer must learn to know and use. A considerable part of so-called physical sickness and disease originates in the etheric binders, and not 1 2 3 4"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Esoteric Physiology 173 in the material body itself. Even contagion and infection are largely the result of disturbances in the etheric envelopes. For example, consider the ethers as protection against bac - terial infections. In the normal state of health the physical body is surrounded by etheric rays which flow out through the skin pores, and enclose the form in a flickering fur-like aura. This aura is a natural defense, repelling contagion and infection, and destroying any germs that come within its field. But, if, for any reason, the chemical vitality is depleted, these sterilizing ether- rays lose their power, and can no longer combat the destructive micro-organisms. P h y s i c a l o R c h e m i c a l e T h e R During life, a pale electric mist hovers about the human skeleton. This is the physical ether, and it seems to originate in the bone marrow. From there it flows out along the heavier chemical formations, touching with its eerie light each cell and organ of the body. Pronounced condensations of this same ether surround most of the vital organs, the strange glow being especially bright about the heart, where it serves as the focus for the physi - cal principle of the body, which is located at the apex of the left ventricle. The human body’s inorganic chemical processes are con - trolled and regulated by the natural energies which operate through the physical ether. As a chemical binder it preserves the arrangement of the element-patterns which make up the corporeal form. Because of its peculiar cohesive power it serves as a matrix holding within itself all the basic substances in - volved in the human chemistry. The physical ether is most active in child life, from the first year to the seventh, during which time its crystallizing activities"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"174 Healing, the Divine Art are establishing order in the inorganic structure that is to serve as the foundation for organic life. In the newborn infant this ether is derived directly from the maternal parent and carries the ancestral records implanted in the fertilized cell at the time of impregnation, and it is the medium for the perpetuation of hereditary tendencies, and the cause of family resemblance. In a larger way it also preserves racial differentiation, and determines organic quality. The physical ether is the most dense and material of the four etheric essences; and it is so similar to the corporeal body from which it emanates that the two are bound together with an in - tense vibratory sympathy. Paracelsus’ followers taught that this ether could be injured by sharp instruments, shocks, bruises, and various accidents which affected the physical body. The higher ethers will permit the repairing of the tissue of the body when cut or wounded, but the chemical ether is entirely inor - ganic, and injuries to it will not heal. The marks will remain, and their shadows in the flesh are called scars, or scar tissue. Plastic surgery in many cases can remove physical scars. But plastic surgery has no effect on the etheric records. Persons hav - ing some extension of vision can still see the abrasions, even after all traces apparently have been removed. As the physical ether impresses the form patterns upon mat - ter, derangement of it may result in deformities, monstrosities, and imperfect births. These bodies seldom survive, for they lack the perfection that permits the proper manifestation of the higher life principles through them. Childhood ailments, especially those in which the bones fail to harden properly, or crystallize too rapidly, are due to derangement of the physical ether. The common reservoir of the chemical ether is the earth, and those suffering from a deficiency of this ether’s activity should contact the earth as much as possible. But they must not expose themselves to the direct rays of the sun. Essential to"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Esoteric Physiology 175 them are the minerals in food, and additional mineral support may be indicated. If there is an excess of crystallization, the mineral intake must be reduced, and the supply of functional ether correspondingly increased. In Europe, occultists have been experimenting with polari - ties which can be taken into the body to increase the flow of the ethers. One of the substances with which they have been working is meteoric iron. Because of its tremendous magnetic powers, this material is useful in combating deficiencies of the etheric energies. Paracelsus was of the opinion that chemical drugs are important to the body, not because they can be as - similated, but because they set up magnetic poles and attract the ethers which are so necessary to physical health. f u n c T i o n a l o R v i T a l e T h e R The vital body of the human being is a brilliant complex of radiant energy. The force follows along every nerve, so that each fiber seems to be filled with an internal light. It glistens in the cell tissue, and the minute particles appear like tiny stars. Around the spleen, which is its peculiar center in the body, it makes a gleaming aureole. In pulsing waves it pours out from the nerve ends and extends several inches beyond the skin. This ether fills all structure with vitality and life, and wherever func - tions are taking place, it gathers its shining substances and en - ergizes the organs and muscles for their tasks. The essential functions of life, growth, reproduction, assim - ilation, excretion, and circulation are maintained by the forces flowing through the vital ether. It also distributes pigmenta - tion. This ether regulates the life energy supply, called prana by the Hindus, which sustains all organic structure, thus main - taining the functions of living tissue. As the chemical ether is associated with the solids of the body, so the functional ether"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"176 Healing, the Divine Art is related to the fluids, and was known among the ancients as the “water of life.” This vital ether is closely involved in all of the processes of human growth, and is especially active from the seventh to the fourteenth years, the period of most rapid physical devel - opment. As the result of the abundance of functional etheric energy at that time, there is a rapid increase in the number of cells, with a corresponding enlargement of the composite structure. In the adult, the principal work of this ether is the restora - tion of tissue destroyed by physical, emotional, or mental activ - ity, and the rebuilding of structure destroyed or enervated by disease. The happy sense of well-being enjoyed by those in good health is the direct result of the normal flow of vitality through the channels of the functional ether. Nature has entrusted the perpetuation of the species to the vital ether, and it is the vortex of this substance in seeds and eggs and animal cells that makes them fertile. The amazing endurance of this etheric atom is attested to in a number of remarkable ways. Wheat, found in the hand of an Egyptian pharaoh who had been buried more than three-thousand years, was planted and it grew. Yet so sensitive is the fertility principle that the slightest derangement of its physical magnetic poles in the body may result in sterility. Although the vital ether is derived from the sun, its activity in the human body is most intense during sleep. It sustains and regulates the automatic and involuntary functions and repairs the consequences of daily wear and tear. If rest is disturbed, this work is interfered with, and the next morning the person does not feel so well. Most of the ailments involving the functional ether are the result of the failure of the human being to cooperate with the biochemical requirements of his body. The effort necessary to mend the damage done by wrong habits, improper diet,"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Esoteric Physiology 177 overwork, and physical exhaustion, may tax this energy flow beyond its capacity. In addition, the vital ether must cope with the depressing and demoralizing effects of destructive mental patterns and emotional excesses which react harmfully upon the physical fabric. Enlargements and benign growths, giant-ism and dwarf - ism, over-stimulation of function, disorders of bodily rhythms, and some types of obesity, are ailments of the vital ether. Ane - mia is an advanced form of etheric debility. Sun baths help in many cases, but, in avoidance of extremes, should be taken only under proper advice. It is a good rule to remember, that the functional ether will serve a man well if he will be moder - ate in all things, and not expect from nature accomplishment of the impossible. Both chemical and vital ether have an interesting photo - graphic quality. As they permeate all the earth’s atmosphere, they are present in any place that man can occupy. A person walking through a room leaves a picture of himself in the ethers of that room; and also a vibratory record of his personality and character. These etheric pictures remain for some time after he has departed. A psychometrist can go into the room later and describe all that has occurred there; and can sometimes do the same from examination of articles of dress, or jewelry, impregnated with the etheric emanations of previous owners. These ethers are especially active in water. Magical vessels filled with water were often used by primitive Witch Doctors and old mystics in their divinations. It is recorded that the celebrated Nostradamus gained some of his prophetic powers from spirits he had captured in bowls of magnetized water, and Cagliostro employed similar methods at his seances. The photographic power and vibratory sympathies in ether are the basis of the new theories of extra-sensory perception. The etheric essences possess what the ancients called an azonic"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"178 Healing, the Divine Art quality. The word azonic means “above zone,” that is, beyond the limitation of place. According to this doctrine, similars are always near to each other regardless of what we call distance. A certain man had his leg amputated, and because he knew nothing about the theory of ethers, he was indifferent as to the disposal of the removed limb. As time went on the man contin - ued to feel pain in the leg that was gone, not an unusual phe - nomena, because part of the etheric body of the leg remained with him. But in this case the pain grew more and more in - tense, and felt as though a sharp instrument was cutting into the missing limb. At last the leg, which had been buried in a wooden box, was dug up, and it proved upon examination that a careless workman had driven a nail through the lid of the box and into the leg. This nail was removed and the patient immediately enjoyed greater comfort. Paracelsus has recorded such instances, but to most modern physicians these are not of interest, not anyhow until something unusual happens to one of their own patients. The activity of the functional ether may continue for a short time after the death of the physical body. There is evidence that hair will grow on the dead. This is denied by some mod - ern authorities, but the older medical writers give numerous examples. A curious book by Oswald Crolli, a disciple of Para - celsus, passed through my hands some time ago. In this work is described a rare case in which the fur continued to grow on an animal’s skin, stretched on a wall. General Albert Pike mentions the vital power of acacia wood, which in Syria will send forth shoots after the tree has been cut down, sawed into planks, and built into door posts. e m o T i o n a l o R P s y c h i c e T h e R Through the arterial system of the human body flows a pale rose light with a greenish fringe of etheric force. This is the"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Esoteric Physiology 179 emotional ether. It courses along the blood vessels in a state of constant pulsation; everywhere there is motion. Around the or - gans, especially the intestinal tract, this fiery substance whirls and eddies. The principal center of the psychic ether is in the liver, and the great vortex of this important gland is a swirling sea of pinkish flame. This ether is responsive to the emotional impulses of the individual, and blazes forth in moments of intense feeling or desire. It registers every mood of the psychic nature, and when for any reason, self-control is lost, as in the case of extreme anger, the effect in the ethers resembles a miniature volcanic eruption. Such outbursts do considerable harm to the etheric structure. If they occur too frequently they will finally destroy emotional control. Through the medium of the emotional ether, the physical body of man is united to his superphysical body of feeling and desire. The two lower ethers are vehicles of involuntary natural processes, but the third ether carries into the emotional centers of the nervous system the fears, angers, disgusts, griefs, joys, surprises, and yearnings of the metaphysical self. It is obvious therefore, that this ether is heavily burdened with impulses, many of which are far from constructive. In addition to its other responsibilities the psychic ether must also distribute the power of motion, and support the sense perceptions. In the growing human being the emotional ether has its period of most intense activity between the fourteenth and twenty-first years. There are marked changes in the physical body during this period, and equally important changes in the mental outlook. It has been observed that many of the less ad - vanced races have unusual problems at this time. Very often, children of these races are mentally alert until adolescence, and then lose the power of further intellectual advancement. A school teacher verified this for me; she taught such a class,"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"180 Healing, the Divine Art and had noted that the children were exceptionally brilliant until their fourteenth year, and from that time on could learn nothing. Impulses carried from the outer world to the emotional and mental bodies enter through the gateways of the sense percep - tions. To a great degree the emotional life is conditioned by externals, and by personal reactions to externals. A person’s general convictions determine largely his impulsive reflexes. The testimonies of the sense perceptions are carried back to the emotional body across the bridge of ether, and the reactions of the emotional body to these testimonies are then returned again through the same ether to the emotional centers in the physical body. In this case the etheric medium carries emo - tional impulses in two directions. The emotional ether can be damaged by an overload of in - tense feeling or desire, in much the same way that too heavy a current damages an electric wire. With its proper function destroyed, the ether may permit an overflowing of emotional content; or it may be so debilitated that emotional reflexes al - most cease. Lack of reasonable emotional control is the cause of numerous physical ailments. On the other hand, too much self-control can prove equally disastrous. All extremes destroy; moderation and right use are the sustaining virtues. Hysteria is one of the most common ailments due to un - balance of the psychic ether. Irresistible feelings flow into the body, and overwhelm the judgment and control. Hallucina - tions of various kinds and a wide variety of psychical distur - bances can be traced to disorganization of this ether. It must be remembered that the ethers are brought into a diseased state as the result of the ab-normalcy of the conscious impulses sent through them. When a breakdown comes, it is not the ethers that are at fault, it is the quality of the material which they are forced to distribute."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Esoteric Physiology 181 m e n T a l o R i n T e l l e c T u a l e T h e R The upper half of the human body is surrounded by a soft golden light that seems to originate in the central parts of the brain. The glow streams out from the third ventricle in particu - lar, enclosing the head in a nimbus like that pictured around the heads of saints. This yellow glow extends down the spine through the sixth ventricle, and touches the spinal nerves with its luminous power. The greater a person’s intellectual life, the stronger the ac - tivity of the mental ether. Its substances and currents are con - stantly responding to thought impulse, and the quality of the mental viewpoint can change the colors in the etheric medium from yellow to deep orange, and even pale green. The intellectual consciousness of the individual flows into the body on the currents of the mental ether. To the psycholo - gist, mind is the total of the conscious states of man; but to the philosopher, mind is man’s consciousness that is perceptive, reflective, and imaginative. It is in this sense that the occultist views the intellect. The mental ether binds the conscious mind to the magnetic field of the pineal gland, which is the mental focus in the physical body. The ways in which mental impulses are distributed through the objective processes of the brain are so important in metaphysical healing that a later chapter is de - voted to a detailed consideration of the subject. The intellectual ether is the most volatile of the etheric es - sences, and is the last to be developed in the maturing of the human being. The activity of this ether begins to be observable in the personality about the twenty-first year, but the period of maximum intensity is from about the forty-fifth to sixtieth years. In the case of an infant prodigy, this ether takes hold earlier in life; and this may cause trouble, because the physical body is not then sufficiently developed to stand the strain of adult mentality."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"182 Healing, the Divine Art The mental ether is the victim of thought disturbances, and may be seriously injured by chronic habits of wrong thinking. All four of the ethers are sensitive to thought impulses, and if they have been seriously affected by faulty mental processes, the consequences are gradually transferred to the physical structure as chronic diseases. Mental senility, and the failure of memory and thought acuteness, is often due to the depletion of this ether. It is an old occult belief that most forms of insanity are not the result of the failure of the mind, but arise in the physical brain or the ethers which support it. If complexes and fixations become too intense, they will destroy the subtle magnetic fields which bind the mind to the brain. The brain, in turn, deprived of the energies necessary to its processes, shows various symptoms of decline and deterioration. Remembering always, that the ethers originate in the physi - cal body, the matter of nutrition becomes a spiritual science. The powers of the ethers depend upon proper food, relaxation, sleep, sunlight, exercise, the normal expression of the emotions and the right attitude of the mind. Many students of the mysti - cal philosophies fail in their search for higher truths because they neglect or even ignore the physical foundation of spiritual regeneration. While the perfection of the physical body is not the principal end of philosophy, the release of the transcenden - tal powers in man depends to a considerable degree upon the health of the body. T h e h u m a n w i l l Closely related to the four fields of etheric energy is that mysterious force which is called the human will. The will has been defined as the total conscious process in making a deci - sion; but much more than decisional activity takes place in its psychic-chemistry. Will power is most frequently an application"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Esoteric Physiology 183 of energy to bring about that which is desired; or that which seems desirable in the light of convictions, ideals, or accepted principles. The direction in which the will is most likely to im - pel life or action is determined by the educational opportuni - ties, the religious affiliations, the environmental circumstances and examples, the economic standards, and the personal incli - nations. Like many of the metaphysical energies that operate through man, the actual substance and nature of the will is unknown to materialistic thinkers, but the consequences which it sets up can be studied and classified. Will is usually bound up with purposes of physical ambition, and if these ambitions are in - ordinate, frequently the result is tragic. The will may force a condition or state that is foreign to the capacity of the personal - ity, and will power, unsupported by adequate rational strength from within the self, can only result in disaster. The delusion is common that will power is a substitute for trained ability. Some metaphysical teachers have circulated doctrines to the effect that a person can accomplish anything that he wills to accomplish. Nothing could be further from the truth; but such ideas appeal to those who have little desire to equip themselves by the arduous procedure of real personal effort. Even if the will could with certainty bring about the circumstances willed for, there is nothing to prove these new conditions would be more solutional than the present state. The uninformed cannot know what is necessary to themselves. The informed quietly but effectively bring about the pat - terns that they require, without heroic exertions of the will. The use of will power in occult healing must be carefully consid - ered, for there are conditions in which it is definitely indicated. For example, the will is useful in breaking up undesirable hab - its, in controlling inordinate impulses, and in directing activity into constructive channels. Moderate self-discipline is good for"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"184 Healing, the Divine Art most persons, and those inclined to be dilatory in matters of decision, or given to sloppy thinking generally, are improved by a little intelligently applied will power. Many who are suffering from dissipation and lack of self-control are in this condition because of will demoralization; in nearly all these cases sugges - tion therapy is helpful. By the judicious use of mental sugges - tion the will can be reestablished as the controller of conduct. The will is a kind of whip, indicated for the lazy, but very destructive to those who are really sick and require a sound pro - gram of health reconstruction. The one exception to this rule is the will to live , Many have recovered from apparently hopeless infirmities by the strength of will alone; when combined with proper therapy the will is a vital factor in recovery. Conversely, patients who lose the will to live may succumb to compara - tively trivial ailments. The attempt to substitute will power for proper treatment, and the type of metaphysics which would deny the right of the body to manifest the diseases which exist within it, can only lead to trouble more serious. The whip or spur may get a last burst of energy from an exhausted horse, but the life of the creature is shortened and we have complicated the misfor - tunes which afflict it. There may be moments when a high duty makes it necessary for us to drive ourselves beyond the breaking point, but this does not mean that we should make a practice of such extreme measures. Pain and fatigue are warnings, and they cannot be denied with impunity. The individual who by will power drives himself beyond the natural endurance of his body will suffer the results, even if he uses a religious formula to justify his actions. The gods never sustain in man any course of action contrary to the laws established for the governing of the world. One who would try to deny symptoms of disease, and go on as though they did not exist, should be fully aware that he is"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Esoteric Physiology 185 a hypochondriac, with symptoms that are entirely imaginary. Seldom can hypochondriacs diagnose themselves as such. Pain is a gentle but insistent reminder that something is wrong; to ignore it is to endanger health and survival. T h e v o i c e o f c o n s c i e n c e Conscience, already mentioned in the chapter on the Witch Doctor, is a mysterious voice worthy of more detailed analysis. Conscience frequently supplies the stuff for exhibitions of will power, so the two can be intimately connected. A theological belief holds that conscience is a spiritual or - gan, by which the will of God is made known in the personal conduct of individuals. A little investigation proves that con - science, far from being the voice of a universal morality, is a very mundane, and often dangerous, form of subconscious opinionism. It is the type of opinionism that Heraclitus called a falling sickness of the reason. Conscience, in actuality, is a fear mechanism, and its origin is in the emotional body. Basically, it is the fear of nonconfor - mity, ever compelling its owner to agree with the patterns of his time. For this reason conscience usually speaks for obedience to law, order, and tradition; and this in many cases is constructive in its effect, for society can survive only if its parts conform with the rules which have been established by the whole. But, though these rules may be necessary, it does not follow that they are divine. Left to its own devices, conscience would no doubt make a very sensible contribution to human betterment; but unfor - tunately, its gentle ways have been interfered with seriously by religious training. Most religious teachings are heavily loaded with ‘thou shalt nots,’ and these have a demoralizing effect on the conscience. They cause this poor faculty to lose all sense of orientation and dissolve in a sea of fears."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"186 Healing, the Divine Art We will never have a spiritual code that solves human prob - lems, prevents war and crime, and leads men to the Promised Land of personal and collective security, until fear is removed from the mechanisms of soul conversion and religious practice. It is impossible to live a truly God-like existence with terror in the heart. Conscience having become the vehicle of the taboos, it can no longer be depended upon to indicate the proper course of action. A man may obey the dictates of his conscience and yet be a danger to himself and a menace to all others in his com - mu n it y. Some have taught that conscience is the voice of Karma, (the principle or law of as-ye-sow-so-shall-ye-reap ) ; but this is not always true, according to my experience with conscience sufferers. The effect is much more likely to have originated in the parental home, where good and bad were defined according to the personal points of view of father and mother. These well- meaning elders, with their well set opinions on virtue or vice may, or may not, have had any intelligent understanding of the meaning of either. Out of “don’t do this,” and “don’t do that,” from tired and exasperated elders, conscience is born. On and on through the years, it keeps repeating, parrot-like, “don’t do this,” and “don’t do that.” A mind accustomed to this endless cycle of negatives be - comes keenly aware of the monotonous voice of the proprieties in every aspect of life, chanting the same dolorous admoni - tions. Resistance to the traditions having been broken in child - hood, before the character is formed, generation after genera - tion goes on, conforming to the old ways; because of fear, fear of displeasing the multitudes who sing the “don’ts.” It is through those who refuse to accept the will and at - titudes of the many that progress comes to the world.

Many of these blazers of new trails are heartily persecuted in their own time for their refusal to conform, only in later centuries to be hon - ored as heroes, with their words and thoughts set up as the basis of new standards of conformity. A great many people are suffering from conscience trouble, and some of them deserve their remorse; but others are mis - erable over thoughts and actions that violate some system of hereditary ‘don’ts,’ but are perfectly natural and honorable. Let me give you a true instance of how foolish and stupid the whole thing can be. A man came to me on the verge of a complete nervous breakdown; he was so mentally and morally sick that his life was endangered. He told me he was filled with shame, he could never raise his head and look men in the eyes again; he was a sinner. This awful knowledge had ruined his digestion and destroyed his peace of mind. He was conscience stricken. And what was the horrible sin? A religious organization that he belonged to forbade its mem - bers to attend motion picture shows on pain of the loss of their immortal souls, and in a moment of weakness the devil had tempted him, and he had gone to see the March of Time. More terrible yet, he had taken his children. This had not at the mo - ment appeared so sinful, but as the weeks passed his conscience had revealed to him the magnitude of the offense. He had bro - ken his solemn vow, had himself done a sinful deed, and had contributed to sin in the lives of his children. It is hard to believe that a thing like this could happen in our day. There is of course nothing spiritually or naturally wrong in going to a motion picture. The real fault lay with the religious group, clinging to a medieval antipathy to all places of amusement. The seventeenth century Protestants stopped even the Shakespearean theater in England."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"188 Healing, the Divine Art The crux of the man’s remorse was the broken obligation. He had given his solemn word, and had not kept it. In this case the sufferer was guilty of two faults. The lesser one was breaking his word, and the greater one was that he had taken such a vow in the first place. But, an obligation which is un - reasonable, unnatural, and out of harmony with wisdom and truth, cannot be binding. No religion can prove that Deity requires such vows. And no man can be held to his word once it is apparent that the entire premise is false. Many religious and most metaphysical organizations de - mand that their students sign various pledges and vows before they can become members in good standing. Because little, if any, personal consideration is given to the characters or tem - peraments of students, these obligations frequently are unsuit - able, and if strictly observed bring disaster. But the majority of joiners do not take their vows too seriously, and their con - sciences do not hurt. It is the very sincere and conscientious person who gets into trouble. He tries to live the letter of his vows, secure in the belief that the cult knows what is good for him; he goes along full of faith until some of his unnatural obligations unsettle his life, forcing him to modify his practices in order to survive; he then has trouble with his conscience. It would surprise you how many metaphysicians are having this kind of difficulty with the still small voice. Of a great number who have come to me for help, some tell stories that are pitiful beyond words. Many psychologists are of the opinion that once the con - science pattern is firmly set, the individual is most likely to be happy if he conforms with its dictates.

But spiri - tuality and fear cannot abide in the same personality.

This is not always easy; the patient’s own descrip - tion of the circumstances which have brought about his dif - ficulties may be quite misleading. If the sufferer is himself a metaphysician, he is likely to have an elaborate explanation of his ailments based upon things he has been taught, or from suggestions made by fellow students. The practitioner has to remember that to the mystically minded all disease takes on mystical qualities, which usually have no existence except in the imagination. Take the case of a woman who had been studying with sev - eral oriental teachers who specialized in breathing exercises. She developed a curious type of headache, affecting the region behind the eyes, and causing great physical discomfort. She discussed the matter with one of her instructors.

The gland is con - nected intimately with the phenomenon of sight, and deteriora - tion of the gland frequently is accompanied by Impairment of the vision. In the normal and healthy adult, the pineal gland contains a number of small granules or crystals.

A technique for the diagnosis of pineal imbalance is as yet quite imperfect, and the methods of treatment are wholly inadequate. The usual procedure to date has been to attempt to normalize the function of this gland by conditioning the other glandular bodies. No satisfactory method for direct treatment has as yet been standardized. Questioning several prominent endocrinologists as to the latest scientific information concerning the pineal gland, they have agreed in substance that its true purpose in the life of the human being is unknown; and they also expressed considerable doubt as to whether the gland is active in the normal adult. The pineal gland appears to reach its maximum activity at ap - proximately the twelfth year of human growth. After this time a retrogressive process starts and the gland function decreases until its effect becomes negligible. This may be true of the pineal gland as a physical structure, but these conclusions are not in agreement with the results of clairvoyant investigation. Nearly all of the independent opera - tors who have examined the gland with the aid of extra-sen - sory perception agree on one point-the pineal gland is active throughout life, and, under certain conditions, its activity may increase to a marked degree.

During this time the opportunities have been many to examine a considerable number of persons in whom the activity of this gland presented unusual features. I hold to the hope, and there is every reason to believe, that in time material science and the occult sciences will unite their findings and recognize the necessity of supplementing each other in research problems of this kind. Seen clairvoyantly, the pineal gland is located near the cen - ter of a magnetic field or aura varying from twelve to sixteen inches in diameter. This aura has no exact or definite boundar - ies, nor are its radiations entirely uniform. Rather, it appears as a pulsing, flickering field of energy which becomes inten - sified under stimulation or irritation, and fades to an almost imperceptible condition as the result of extreme mental or vital exhaustion. Regarding the term aura , all living organisms continually are exuding an insensible perspiration. These subtle emanations are actual extensions of etheric nerve force beyond the termi - nal circumference of the physical nervous system. The aura, or physical magnetic field, therefore, is an emanation from the nerve terminals which surrounds the body with a dim but dis - cernible radiance. These auric emanations flow from the nerve terminals with an appearance resembling fine fur. When intensely magnified, each separate emanation is visible as a stream of minute geo - metrically shaped particles pouring with great velocity from the skin’s surface."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Pineal Gland and the Mental Focus 197 Not only is the human body itself surrounded by a field of these emanations, but each part of the body—organs, systems, and secretions—have their own emanations or auras.

The col - ors, the extent, and the rates of vibration of these magnetic fields reveal the intrinsic natures of the structures from which they proceed. No important change can take place within the structure of any living organism without modifying its aura. v i s i b i l i T y o f T h e g l a n d ’ s a u R a The late Dr. Kilner developed a technique for rendering cer - tain parts of the human magnetic field visible to non-clairvoy - ant vision. With the aid of dicyanin screens he was able to cause a temporary change in the human optical processes which en - abled the average person to see the lower or least attenuated parts of the human aura. Intensive research carried on with these screens resulted in the development of a technique for the diagnosis of human diseases through the study of the patterns and modifications visible in the auric emanations. For details of his methods, consult his text, The Human Atmosphere. The aura of the pineal gland is one of the principal systems of emanations visible in the composite structure of the human being. In brilliance and size it is second only to the aura of the heart, which is the largest and most completely organized mag - netic field in the human body.

The power of visual aware - ness is under the control of the will of the trained clairvoyant, and may be shifted from one plane or focus to another. As the focus changes, various phases of one problem may be analyzed separately. A number of different vibratory qualities must be analyzed and differentiated in the case of the present research. To make this possible, the clairvoyant visual focus must change with each phase of the problem. In other words, each part of the phenomenon must be examined and described in terms of its own plane, or in the vibratory level upon which the phenom - enon occurs. If the focus is not changed, only a part of the sequence of force activity can be examined. Omitting to do this accounts, in part at least, for the di - versity of testimonies which have accumulated in clairvoyant investigation of nature’s unseen forces.

Unbalance as the result of injury or disorder affecting any single gland or group of glands of the endocrine chain. Under such conditions the pineal shows a rapid loss of tone. If one of the lower glands is disturbed or depressed, it throws its load upon another gland. For example: affections of the thyroid may result in a stimulation of the parathyroids, which take up the work of the diseased gland and attempt to preserve bodily har - mony. The pineal is the only gland in the ductless chain which can not shift its load. It is, therefore, less frequently disordered than the other glands, but once affected it is more difficult to cure. 2. The pineal gland may be disturbed through reflex action from the mind. Destructive thoughts with their interrelated emotional states can result in physiological changes in the or - ganic structure and function of the pineal gland. The gland, once disordered in this way, has a tendency to throw out the functions of the other glands, especially those connected with the processes of reproduction. Serious diseases of the pineal usually involve the rational powers. The disturbance may not be accompanied by any seri - ous pain, but it is particularly observable in the eyes; the pupils may contract and there is a tendency to stare without focusing. Some hallucinations of an optical nature may be experienced, and the imagination becomes distorted. Lesser disturbances are associated with fatigue, lack of coordination and continuity"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"200 Healing, the Divine Art of thought, supersensitivity, loss of appetite, nausea, lowered circulation. In all cases where morbid psychology exists apart from morbid pathology, derangement of the pineal may be sus - pected. Insomnia is often present, and occasionally a sense of pressure directly under the crown of the head. Chemical analy - sis of the blood will often show a deficiency of calcium. Except for a limited study of the pineal gland from a patho - logical standpoint, very little actual information about this mys - terious organ is available. Some clairvoyant research has been carried on, but for the most part the observations are merely restatements of occult traditions which identify the gland as the “third eye” referred to in ancient religious symbolism. Ob - servations of the activity of this gland in certain reptiles prove that it is a rudimentary eye which retired into the brain after the development of the present optic system. The composition of the gland itself sustains these findings, and indicates that it might still be sensitive to light. e x T R a - s e n s o R y a n a l y s i s o f T h e P i n e a l g l a n d H.P. Blavatsky, in the E.S. Papers , and certain commentar - ies by her original students and disciples, have indicated a pos - sible course of study which may lead to a more complete knowl - edge of the true structure and purpose of the pineal gland at this stage of human evolution. When first examined, the pineal gland’s magnetic field glows as an electrical haze of bluish-green luminosity, brilliant at its circumference and almost invisible in those parts closest to the gland itself. In the almost spherical field the gland ap - pears, under some conditions, as if in the midst of a hollow globe with a bubble-like wall. The gland is not in the exact center of the globe; when seen clairvoyantly, it is up about one-third of the distance from the"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"The Pineal Gland and the Mental Focus 201 lower extremity of the field. Thus observed, the gland itself re - sembles a minute four-pointed star of extreme brilliance. Fur - ther examination shows that in the small granules is the source of the star-like light; they glow, not with an inherent energy, but as though fluorescent. A further examination of the magnetic field of the gland shows that this field is stratified. There are ten concentric cir - cles, each dimly but clearly demarcated. Each of these circles or rings is in the orbit of small but brilliant points of light. The entire gland with its magnetic field thus resembles a miniature solar system, which is in constant motion around the structure of the gland itself. The axis of the gland’s magnetic field is so inclined that its upper extremity passes through the skull close to the two small foramina near the crown of the head. These correspond to what the Hindus call the brahma-randhra , or gate of Brah - ma. According to the Hindus, life, departing from the body at death, leaves through these foramina. They are connected to the brain by very direct nerve filaments, which are burned out or destroyed by the departure of the life-principle; and it is this which makes it impossible to resuscitate a person once actually dead. The motion of the small points of light within their orbits in the magnetic field of the pineal gland is proportioned math - ematically to the sidereal motion of the celestial solar system. It appears (but this will require confirmation) that the annual motion of the solar bodies is accomplished diurnally in the smaller glandular orbits-a day with man being equal to a year in the solar system. The small orbital points of light of the gland are the posi - tive poles of the complete human endocrine system.

Derangement, disease, irritation, or atrophy of any of the other glands is visible immediately as a modification of its cor - responding energy center in the pineal system. The seven prin - cipal organs of the brain itself are physical extensions of these glandular vortices. (See E.S. Instruction .) All physical organs are physical extensions of invisible energy centers throughout the physical body. The brain is the Mercavah , or chariot, (San - skrit: vahan ) of the pineal gland; and the ten smaller vortices in the aura of the gland are the horses attached to the chariot of the Sun, the racing steeds described by St. Chrysostom. Further inquiry reveals that the magnetic field of the pi - neal body not only has its pole inclined to correspond with the earth’s pole, but it also has a hypothetical equator. And, in conformity with ancient symbolism, the entire magnetic field is enclosed within an empyrean or heavenly wall composed of thirty-six constellational surfaces, corresponding to the princi - pal constellations of the zodiacal and extra-zodiacal orders. This arrangement need not be regarded as hopelessly com - plex or involved. While adequate description is exceedingly difficult, the arrangement itself, when conceived as a whole, is orderly, simple; and it is in perfect conformity with the analogical processes everywhere evident in nature. The gland and its auras constitute a microcosm. The cabalists perfectly symbolized the mystery in their Sephirothic tree. The first and highest part of this tree they called Kether; it corresponds to the pineal gland. Chochmah , and Binah , the second and third spheres, correspond to the right and left lobes of the cerebrum. In the cabalistic writings it is stated that the ten parts of the Sepherothic tree represent the ten parts of the human body, but that all of these parts exist primarily within Kether itself. Thus the whole tree is within the Crown (Kether) in principia . Likewise, the whole body and the whole life of man is within the magnetic field of the pineal gland, the light radiating from which is the Crown."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The Pineal Gland and the Mental Focus 203 T h e s e a T o f s P i R i T u a l P o w e R s The implications of this ancient esoteric science are inevi - table: The universe is an extension of powers that remain eternally in the nature of Deity. Man is an extension of powers resident eternally in his own spiritual source. And the body of man is the extension of powers resident temporally within the aura of the pineal gland. Although the aura is divided into ten parts, only the lower four of these parts are concerned with the maintenance of the physical bodily economy. The lower four parts of the aura of the pineal gland are involved in the distribution of the four ethers described in the previous chapter. The remaining six parts of the magnetic field have comparatively little to do with man’s external life. Their function is noumenal rather than phenom - enal . The ten states of the magnetic field are roughly divisible into two groups of five each, which may be termed the higher and the lower. The five lower are related directly to sensory percep - tion, and the five higher to the mind-octaves of these percep - tions; or to the five perceiving powers for which the perceptions themselves are the media. In the various orders of life, visible and invisible, the po - sition of the gland itself in relationship to its magnetic field varies, regulated by the focusing power peculiar to each of the kingdoms of the animal creation.

This chapter will consider only the fourth field , the one which controls the mental life of the hu - man being. It is typical of the five orbits which make up the southern hemisphere of the magnetic sphere. Those composing the northern hemisphere must be approached through an en - tirely different system of analysis. Separated from the rest of the aura, the fourth field appears keyed dominantly to the color green. The reaction, however, is not as much to the shades of green familiar to us, as to a kind of green that is sensed in the substance of light. We are aware that it is green, but we could not hope to find a color or shade of color by which this green could be reproduced in pigment. This green glow is divided within its own field, in divisions that are extremely attenuated and defy complete analysis. This green field is the present focus for the pineal gland it - self. The gland is located slightly below the center, and, appears to be floating on the surface of a somewhat denser color which occupies the lower two-fifths of the field. In form, the mental field of the pineal gland resembles a spherical glass bottle, the lower two fifths of which appears as though filled with a semi-liquid mist; in the upper part, the material is of almost the same color but entirely gaseous. It is on the surface of the lower semi-liquid mist that the structure of the gland itself seems to rest. Its radiance is more brilliant upward than downward, and it moves slightly as though carried on the surface of a slight tidal motion.

It appears that this motion is not entirely intrinsic; or, possibly more correctly, inherent; but at least part"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The Pineal Gland and the Mental Focus 205 of the motion is communicated to it as to a ship floating on the surface of water. A short distance from the gland itself is a smaller brilliant antibody which for lack of a better term we shall call a men - tal vortex. Revolving about the gland in an ecliptic it causes periodic descent into the denser substances in the lower part of the magnetic field. This vortex makes a complete revolution about the central gland in approximately twenty-four hours. About one-third of this time is required for its passage through the lower part of the sphere, when the antibody is somewhat dimmed. This phenomenon may prove to be part of the expla - nation as to the nature -of sleep. The effect of rearranging sleep hours so as to break the normal rhythm of this motion will require special research, for it has been observed that in some persons and at some times, the revolutional motion of this an - tibody appears to be more rapid. The antibody itself is an important structure of mentoids or mental atoms. It has its own polarity and a rotational motion accompanied by constant emanation. This causes the structure to appear like a tiny spiral nebula. Disturbances of the brain, the optic thalamus, and the anterior lobe of the pituitary body cause disturbances within the structure of this pineal antibody. T h e f u n c T i o n i n g o f T h e P i n e a l g l a n d In the metaphysics of the classical Greeks, the superphysical nature of man is divided into nine parts arranged in the form of three triads. To these is added the physical body, which com - pletes the decad consisting of nine numbers and the cipher— the Pythagorean tetractys . Man was exoterically seven; esoterically, ten. Each of the triads was said to be posited in a sphere. The first triad abode in the Supreme Sphere, and consisted of Being, Life, and Light, which together comprise spirit."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"206 Healing, the Divine Art The second triad abode in the middle sphere, denominated by the Greeks the Superior World. This was the triad of mo - tion. Its parts were: the Unmoved, the Self-moving, and the Moved, referred to collectively as the “gods,” and considered as the zonic and azonic hierarchies—that is, those powers which abide in place, and those which abide distinct from place. The third triad, which abode in the Inferior Sphere, was termed formative. It consisted of the principles of generation designated as creative, preservative, and disintegrative. Collec - tively they comprised the supermundane divinities, of which order the Greeks declared Zeus to be the chief. The equivalent of Zeus in the human system is the ego, or the complex of self from which personalities are suspended as flowers from a par - ent stem. The supermundane principles through their exten - sion outward into the tenth sphere, which is matter, produce form, which is organized matter. Of forms, the human body is the most important to man. Personality is the complex arising from the relationship ex - isting between the supermundane ego and the chain of bodies which it has precipitated. The ego itself, located in the midst of the magnetic field of the physical body, appears in juxtaposition to the physical heart and controls the entire body by impinging its power on the subtle filaments of the Bundle of His. The posi - tive pole of the ego, its radiant principle, impinges itself upon the granules in the pineal gland and the adjacent sensitive nerve areas, which become fluorescent as a result. The negative pole operates through the sacro-coccygeal gan - glia and the principal internal organs of the generative system. The ego itself has no direct effect upon the physical body except that which it produces in the heart. Its other manifestations are achieved by the polarities which it sustains.

It is not merely a third eye in the body; it is the eye of the overself, the focusing point between two con - ditions of form, the invisible archetypal form, and the visible corporeal body. As this focus is located in the vibration of the mental nature, it may be said to grow in the neutral etheric zone between mind and brain. The most sensitive parts of the physical brain, dilated by the presence of an almost intangible gas, are so refined that their ethers mingle with the lowest and most nearly physical elements of the higher nature itself. While they mingle they never actu - ally coalesce, because the two sets of rays move in different di - rections; but the impingement is so close and so nearly perfect that a neutral zone is created. This neutral zone corresponds with the middle part of the vibratory register of the magnetic field of the fourth orbit of the pineal gland. Impulses from the mind must pass through this focus as through a lens before they can be distributed by the brain as nerve impulses. In the same way, all sensory impulses collected from the periphery of the nerve system must return through this lens before they can be incorporated into the mental nature itself. d e f i n i T i o n o f m i n d a n d b R a i n How, then, shall we define the mind? Pragmatically, it is the cause of those mentational processes which we call thought. It includes inspiration, reflection, imagination, analysis, com - parison, and memory. It must be accepted also as the source of mental experience, containing not only the evidence accumu - lated by the senses from the experiences of objective life, but the residual matter of previous lives—all that can be implied by karmic memory.

Brain is an extension downward of mind into matter, in the same way that the spinal cord is an extension of the brain down into the body. The difficulty of analogy arises because mind, though a form and having dimensions, is beyond the imita - tions of our visual power. It is mysterious to us, not because there is any actual mystery about it, but just because we cannot see it. Therefore, if mind has the brain as its pole in the body, and is connected with the brain through certain etheric magnetic areas, the entire procedure is brought within the limits of our comprehension. The scientific objection to the idea of the existence of mind independent of brain is easily met by the philosophically in - clined: So long as brain must serve as a condenser and distribu - tor of mental impulses which cannot become tangible except through some sensitive magnetized field, it is quite obvious that the removal of that field, or its absence, will result in the failure of mental manifestation. The entire brain as we know it, or even brain organization as we understand it, is not essential to mental existence. But the presence of the magnetic field is essential. Simple mono-cellular organisms in which no individual brain has been organized are capable of manifesting rudimen - tary forms of intelligence.

This art, though in its comparative infancy, is making rapid strides toward the comprehension of its purpose. But psychology can not be regarded as a complete science or a perfected art until its foundations are thoroughly laid in a working knowledge of man’s superphysical mental life.

Visions may be visualized memories, obsessions may be domination by ghosts from the subconscious, voices that sound in the air may come from the mind itself-and not from the spirit land. Even automatic writing may be impelled by fixa - tions that seem to live and have independent existence in the deep parts of the subconscious. Here, thoughts are things; ev - ery impulse has taken form and been given power by frequent repetition. When a heavily loaded subconscious bursts forth into the conscious mind, as it will do finally, if the condition is not corrected, life and health are at hazard. The best method of treating fixations is to break them up before they have time to become deeply entrenched in the con - sciousness. Grudges held, regardless of the justification, destroy the holder, and not the opponent. No habits should be allowed to take possession of a life so firmly that they cannot be bro - ken by a simple application of the will. It is to be remembered that men do not have habits, habits have the men. The past should not be permitted to over-shade the present effort, nor old sorrows be allowed to breed in the mind the pleasant pain of martyrdom. Wrong thinking is its own reward—and that reward is misery."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"212 Healing, the Divine Art If it is too late for preventative therapy, then it is necessary to resort to other means. The old patterns must be broken up by an intelligent application of the will. Psychoanalysis helps, but the process is long and expensive. It has been my observation that one of the most terrible aspects of subconscious impulse is an accompanying deadly se - riousness. Those most afflicted will fight with all their strength to justify their misfortunes and rationalize the worst of what they believe. In such cases a sense of humor comes like the shining ray of St. Michael’s flaming sword, which overcame the Prince of Darkness and his legion of unhappy spirits. The man able to laugh at his own mistakes, who can toss aside with a smile the bitter things that have burdened his soul, can do much to unseat the phantoms that are riding on his thoughts. Never must there be bitterness in the laugh, but the sure realization that man is the master of his destiny, and it is in his power to lift the load of his despondency by seeing through them, understanding them, and cheerfully accepting the les - sons they have to teach. T h o u g h T P a T T e R n s If three distinguishable mental currents are flowing down - ward from mind into brain, and from brain through body, it is also true that three distinct states of reflexes are flowing back through nerve into brain, and through brain into mind. Men - tal impulses set up glandular reflexes, and the entire glandular system is involved in human thinking. Conversely, glandular impulses, interpreted first biochemi - cally and then psycho-chemically, affect the mind and the mental attitudes by conditioning sensory and emotional reflex - es. Thus a vicious circle is set up, and we become aware of the absolute interdependence upon each other of all the manifesta - tions of life."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"The Pineal Gland and the Mental Focus 213 One school of endocrinology declares that disposition is a matter of glands. It would be just as fair to say that glands are a matter of disposition. Harmony in the mind results in the increasing health of the body; and harmony in the body im - proves the disposition of the mind. The whole purpose of man’s mental evolution is to bring the mind and body into perfect coordination. If the exigencies of the life render this impossible at any given time, then the mind, as the superior part, should receive the greatest emphasis. It is possible for the mind to excel the body because of its natural and inherent excellence; but it never is possible for the body to excel the mind in a normal personality pattern, because of its utter dependency upon the superior part. Excellence of the hu - man body should not be regarded as merely its physical health, but is to be measured in terms of degrees of refinement and sensitivity to mental impulses. The dispositional equation is the result of the complex of mind working through brain. The brain stores up in its own auric field the experiences of the senses and its reactions there - to. This material is absorbed mentally by the mind and trans - muted into experience. Thus, in a sense, the brain is a sort of stomach which receives into itself certain foods, but the di - gestion of these foods and the assimilation of their energy el - ements is reserved for the processes of mental alchemy. The undigested parts of experience also affect the bodily economy. These impulses are associated with the secretion of pituitrin by the pituitary body; the flow of this secretion differs with each individual, and its psychic load depends upon the undigested mental material which still is in the brain.

It is a struggle between a superior and an in - ferior power for dominion over mental phenomena. The strug - gle apparently is rendered equal, because the brain, though far less in power than the mind, is closer to the body and more im - minently understandable. For this reason the ancients symbol - ized the brain by the moon and the mind by the sun. Leonardo da Vinci went so far as to declare that the moon gave tides to the fluids in the brain. In this he expressed an opinion current during his time. The neutral zone at the point of overlap between the mag - netic fields of the brain and the mind is entirely qualitative, and may only be recognized with the aid of clairvoyant perception. We shall refer to this neutral zone as a LENS, because it is a transmitter of mental light; this the old philosophers referred to as the “light of the soul,” or “the light of reason,” the mysterious light that “Lighteth every man that cometh into the world.” It is the sidereal light of the microcosm, according to Paracelsus and the Cabalists. Certain reflexes are transmitted to the brain by the crys - talline lens of the eye; but it is the magnetic lens that is the medium for the distribution of noumenal and phenomenal im - pulses. As defects in the crystalline lens of the eye result in the distortion of the vision, so defects in the magnetic lens result in aberrations of mental activity. Such astigmatism of the mag - netic lens is the basis for many abnormal psychological states."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The Pineal Gland and the Mental Focus 215 As the magnetic lens exists by virtue of the blending of two magnetic fields, its clarity requires an exact adjustment and blending; every mood of the individual affects these, and every mental and emotional reaction. The mind, as the source of reason in man, flows downward into manifestation through this lens. Pure thought always is qualified or conditioned by the state of the lens. Passing through the lens, thought distorted by any fault that may exist in the lens itself, is reflected upon the sensitive centers of the nervous system. The testimony of the senses coordinated in the magnetic field of the brain is reflected upward or inward through the same lens; and the reflection thus cast upon the attenuated sur - face of the mind itself is likewise distorted according to the imperfections of the lens. Thus the lens itself determines by its quality the accuracy of the impulses which pass through it. The lens may be variously impaired. If the two magnetic fields can not blend at least in part, the result is idiocy. If the blending is but partly accomplished, we have the subnormal and the mo - ron. Under such conditions no reasonable images are reflected either upward or downward, and only mental confusion and opacity remain. Let us consider how the magnetic field of the brain may be affected. T h e m a g n e T i c f i e l d o f T h e b R a i n Every thought arising in the personality complex assumes geometrical form in the brain’s aura. This has long been es - tablished by clairvoyant research and the findings of trained psychics. These patterns set up in the magnetic field of the brain have been called thought-forms, forms that consist of a color, a num - ber, a sound, and a form. They are precipitated with the same"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"216 Healing, the Divine Art regularity and complexity of design that we see in snowflakes, and in such geometrically formed creatures as radiolaria. The repetition of any special series of thoughts intensifies these thought-forms. The result is that they are constantly appear - ing and disappearing within the magnetic field, some persisting and others rapidly fading out. When these thought-forms represent sudden moods or transient opinions, they blaze out brightly with various col - ors and emit a subtle sound. When they represent established convictions, they grow steadily; their intensity is augmented by the fixation of the will. Thus a man attending a concert and affected by the music will interpret these impulses by a mood which is visible clairvoyantly as luminous radiations or waves in the magnetic field. When the concert is over and the mind returns to its normal preoccupations, these waves fade out and other patterns take their place. But an intense hatred will continue as a constant pattern, and may build in intensity over a period of years. Such an intense pattern may ultimately dominate and so completely impregnate the entire magnetic field that it will affect all other thought-forms that may arise there. What the metaphysician terms thought-forms, the psy - chologist calls fixations, complexes, phobias, and neuroses. The stronger patterns by their vibratory rates produce subtle but permanent changes in the entire substance of the brain’s mag - netic field. The result will be distortion in the blending of the brain’s magnetic aura with the magnetic field of the mind; and in extreme cases even a complete rupture of the two fields may occur. Under such conditions the individual loses his reason as the result of destructive fixations. In many cases, the blending of the two magnetic fields is impaired rather than destroyed, and various degrees of men - tal abnormality are apparent. Nature, eternally striving after balance and normalcy, has devised auto-corrective processes to"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The Pineal Gland and the Mental Focus 217 break down strong fixations in the magnetic field of the brain. Thought-forms may be combated or neutralized by opposing thought-forms, upon the basis that two rates of vibration may neutralize each other. Also, thoughts or emotions of extraor - dinary intensity may cause such disturbance within the mag - netic field of the brain that they will burn out entire areas of complexes and fixations. Observation of the brain’s magnetic field during moments of ecstasy or great emotional exhilaration gives the key to various systems of mental therapy. The mind itself also affects its own magnetic field, but usu - ally the effects are less obvious than those set up in the brain. The mind, less subject to transitory moods than the brain, does not create thought-forms. Rather, the entire magnetic field of the mind changes gradually, usually from the circumference to - ward the center. The modifications appear first as color chang - es in the outer fringe of the field, the hues moving gradually toward the center until the entire field changes color. Within one color, as we can perceive it, there are innumerable shades, because the mind is constantly modifying the color values. In many cases, however, there appears to be a general tone pecu - liar to the mind and relatively permanent, and the changes are modifications of this tone. The lens composed of the overlapping of the two magnetic fields is thus in constant motion within itself. Even in the state of physical sleep this motion continues, although the colors and forms are somewhat dim. An elaborate series of personality complexes may cause a frost-like appearance to arise in the lens. The personality pat - terns, like the frost pictures on a windowpane, have shape and definition, but in addition they have an element of life in them that is not apparent in frost pictures. Mental energy passing downward through the lens reflects these thought patterns into the nervous system, where they become the source of innumer - able dispositional complexes. The sensory perceptions sending"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"218 Healing, the Divine Art their energy upward through the lens into the mind similarly cause the reflection of the lens patterns to be thrown upon the surface-of the mind like stereopticon pictures upon a screen. In this way the testimony of the senses is conditioned by the at - titudes of the brain, and the rational impulses of the mind are modified and distorted by these same patterns. The compos - ite consequence is general distortion of the testimony of both the brain and the mind, and results in the personality complex which we have long accepted as intrinsic to man’s thinking pro - cesses. If the lens becomes too heavily obscured by the patterns, the amount of true light that can pass in either direction is correspondingly limited. Thus a man may experience without benefiting by experience. Or he may have visions of a highly worthy type which he is unable to interpret into action. As long as this confusion exists, he may be said to “see through a glass d a rk ly.” It is the desirable end to which all reasonable human be - ings aspire, that they may perceive clearly and understand that which they perceive. To accomplish these purposes, the lens must be kept clean. If it is already obscured, it must be prop - erly cleansed. If this is accomplished, the result is clarity and c on st a nc y. To accomplish this clarity, the body must supply sufficient magnetic energy to sustain the brain’s magnetic field. The emo - tions and the thoughts must be without any serious complexes, and the will must be directed toward the breaking up of such patterns as arise through wrong reaction to the experiences of life.

If a number of the mental faculties concentrate upon a given object, the mind becomes definitely aware of the reality and substance of that object. As these mental beams meet, they form a powerful focus. The sattva , flowing on the will power of attention, takes up its place in this field of intensity, and functions from it so long as the attention is centered there. At - tention is the will to perceive, and consciousness always moves with the will. Thus we come to understand the nature of the sattva , one of the deepest mysteries of Buddhist philosophy. The center of consciousness is in the midst of the converging rays of the at - tention faculties, and wherever the point of attention is at a given moment, the self is there.

We live, and feel, and think in terms of body, and action is motivated by physical considerations. Among the consequences of focusing attention on the phys - ical body are the primitive impulses toward beautification and adornment. The ancient Chinese, Hindus, and Greeks, both men and women, used cosmetics and perfumes extensively. Dynastic Egyptian ladies enameled their toenails and finger - nails, and carried powder, rouge, and lipstick when they trav - eled. Some central African tribes still regard rancid butter as a particularly fragrant hair oil. And Rajpur gentlemen who wish to be in the height of fashion, henna their beards. The human being, always desiring to be physically attrac - tive to others of his species, has devised a variety of ways to supplement his natural charms. Adornment began with bones, feathers, flowers, and furs. Later, crude ornaments were carved from colored stones, molded from clay, and pounded or cast from metals. Clothing was designed originally for protection or adornment, and not for concealment. It was also used to cover bodily defects, but the motive was aesthetic rather than moral. Only in the last two thousand years has dress been associated definitely with morality, with the curious result that immoral - ity has increased generally among clothed nations. This is be - cause the constant emphasis on the effort for concealment has centered the focus of awareness upon the moral issue.

Certain diseases, especially those ailments which affect the heart, draw the consciousness to their symptoms with an almost hypnotic power. When the physi - cian takes the pulse of a healthy man, even this simple action, by directing awareness, often causes an increase in the rate of the heart-beat. Among sufferers from cardiac disorders there is a strong tendency to become ‘pulse takers.’ The fearful patient will hourly take his own pulse, and will feel that he is having a relapse every time he notices the slightest irregularity. Another group has a symptom fixation, which degenerates rapidly into hypochondria. Still others hold to the foolish conviction that out of pain is out of danger, and dose themselves with pain-killers. It is well known that patients suffering from incurable ailments usually have a more sane attitude toward their condition than those whose health problems are trivial. The reason is, hopelessness frees the mind from uncertainty; the physical fixation relaxes because no cure is possible; the mind resolves to make the best use of the time remaining.

Racial discrimination may cause a body fixation, by making the individual overly conscious of color or facial structure. The athlete also is likely to become a victim of his own physical perfection, and forget that the body is the mortal ve - hicle of an immortal soul.

The hands, and sometimes the entire body must be trained to fulfill the impulses of the mind. What then is skill? To the popular mind, skill is technical ability developed, or acquired, by patience, perseverance, or specialized training. According to this viewpoint, the body is trained to perform certain actions much as we might train a seal for the circus. Considered philosophically, skill is achieved by three pro - cesses: First, the consciousness must be completely informed concerning the laws and principles governing the subject under consideration.

And third, the body itself must be disciplined to respond immediately to the impelling of the will. Skill is a form of self-control, and one of the reasons why a particular technique is so difficult to acquire is, the body of the average person has never been subjected generally to the control of the will. If the center of awareness focuses upon the bodily mechan - ics of an art, the result may be a serious technique fixation. In music, the cleverest technician is seldom the greatest genius, de - spite public opinion to the contrary.

Leonardo da Vinci’s immortal painting, La Gioconda (The Mona Lisa), is priceless, but a perfect reproduction executed by a skilled copyist is worth only a few dollars. The true val - ue of a picture lies in its spiritual content, in the vision which conceived it, in the intangible overtones which pervade it. An adequate technique is important, but certain it is that without inspiration skill is lifeless. The world’s finest artists have paint - ed bad pictures when the subject did not inspire them, and mediocre artists have produced great works under the pressure of a compelling spiritual or emotional impulse.

To the Easterner, our Western singing is “a loud noise full of holes.” He does not understand how anyone can enjoy an in - tellectual rendition of memorized compositions, accomplished by muscular gymnastics. The ‘hole’ occurs when the vocalist must pause for a mighty inhalation of breath before attempt - ing high c. The technique of singing is typical of the artistic method. If the student of voice is fortunate enough to have an intelligent teacher, he learns that tone is formed in the mind and not in the throat. We sing with the mind, through the body. Tone flows out from the tonal center of consciousness as vibration. It is carried on the surface of the will, sustained but never forced by the will power. The vocal cords transform mental tone into physical sound. The will still controls the tone, through the physical medium of the breath. Breath does not create tone; it merely floats the tone as the physical carrier of the transformed mental impulse. Singing is a spiritual experience, and not sim - ply a physical technique. Remembering always that tension destroys tonal quality, the enlightened singer keeps his center of awareness away from all the physical structures involved in tone production. Should the vocalist become breath-conscious he will attempt to force tone by increasing breath. Or, attention will cause tension re - sulting in shortness of breath. If he thinks about his throat, the singer will interfere with natural placement; the tone will become throaty, and the tension will cause dryness and even irritation. Mouth-consciousness will cause tension in the facial muscles, cramping tone and resulting in unpleasant grimaces and those labial contortions so noticeable with badly trained singers. The rule is: Relax and sing, contract and bellow."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"230 Healing, the Divine Art A simple formula to overcome the structure and function fixations which cramp the vocal processes is to place the cen - ter of conscious awareness in the magnetic field outside of the physical body, about twelve inches in front of the mouth. As the magnetic field is an extension of the body itself, the point of attention can be posited in the aura as easily as in physical structure. In a curious extra-dimensional way, this placement of the attention center permits the complete formation of tone before it reaches the awareness. By deliberately placing thought in a specific location, the attention is focused there; and the body is left free to fulfill its own functions without conscious interruption. Actually, this is not singing outside of the body, but rather centering the awareness far enough from the delicate mecha - nism of tone production that it cannot interfere with natural processes. Then to increase volume, the singer does not push tone with breath, rather he moves the center of awareness away from the body and allows tone to flow toward this point. Be - come aware of the man seated in the back row, says the rule, and the tone will reach him; in proper volume and without the distortion that results from forcing. A well instructed singer never tries to sing through a throat cold; he sings over, beyond, and away from the congestion, by keeping the center of awareness outside the body. The same technique would apply if a public speaker develops laryngi - tis. It is possible to overcome many limitations of the body by shifting the point of awareness, with resultant relaxing of tense nerves and muscles. s u d d e n a n d d R a m a T i c c o m P u l s i o n s Many functional ailments are the result of poor health fixa - tions supported by symptoms real or imaginary.

The Chinese have a story, perhaps a legend, about an old scholar whose habit it was to walk by the edge of a little lake, while he meditated upon the spiritual mystery of Tao. One day, while in deep contemplation, his attention fixed on his mysti - cal speculations, he wandered out onto the lake, walking safely upon the water. After a time, he realized suddenly his strange position and fear came to him; he promptly sank and almost drowned. The account of the disciple who walked out on the Sea of Tiberias to meet the Master, has a similar meaning. So long as he kept his attention upon Jesus he was safe, but the moment his mind returned to a self focus, he was afraid, and phenomenal power departed from him.

A fear is an irrational emotion, co-eternal with the animal life of man, and it must be included among those ailments for which no ac - tual cure is known. Bravery is not absence of fear, but courage of conviction in the presence of fear.

We are most afraid of that which we least understand. Then, of course, human survival is threatened by numerous natural hazards and man-made dangers, and those suffering from a general tendency to phobias, magnify these risks and ignore the more optimistic probabilities. One of the most debilitating types of fear is the morbid anticipation of di - saster.

A great many fear fixations originate in childhood, that period being particularly sensitive to impressions. A number of cases have come to my attention in which otherwise nor - mal men and women have suffered extreme mental anguish throughout their mature years as the result of being frightened into obedience, during childhood, by ignorant nursemaids or stupid parents. Religious denominations which promulgate doctrines of sin, hell, and the devil have also contributed heav - ily to infant class emotional demoralization. A fully developed phobia is an unreasonable and uncon - trollable terror of some subject or object. The victim experi - ences the most violent internal panic and suffers indescribable torture, without knowing why; and often with a clear mental realization of the absurdity of his condition. Many phobias originate in the natural human tendency to base false generalizations upon some particular circumstance. A man was bitten by a dog, and as a result was afraid of dogs, on the assumption that all dogs are like the one that bit him. Or, to cite another example, a sensitive and naturally fearful child is locked in a dark closet as a form of punishment. Twenty years later, that child, now grown to manhood, is the husband who asks his wife to get his shoes for him, because he cannot go into the closet of his own room without great emotional disturbance. There is one bright side to the problem of phobias: they usu - ally dissolve in the presence of positive action. The quickest and surest way to overcome a fear fixation is to perform the ac - tion most feared. The man who feared dogs recovered when he bought several dogs and made them his constant companions. The first week he was very uncomfortable, but as the months"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"234 Healing, the Divine Art passed he grew to love his pets. The husband with the fear of closets required a more extended program of treatment. He had a weak heart, and had he abruptly been locked in a dark closet for several hours he might have died of sheer terror. After con - siderable conditioning he was induced to enter the closet for a few seconds, with the door left open. Gradually his courage increased, and he could stay for several minutes without serious discomfort. Then, over a period of weeks, the door was kept closed for successively longer periods. One day, with a tragic kind of courage, he walked to the closet, like a condemned man entering the death cell, closed the door, and remained for half an hour. He came out calm and poised, a look of triumph in his eyes; all he said was, “Now I am not afraid,” but that will speak volumes to those who have suffered long from strange blind fears, who know what it means to actually break one of these fixations. Another irrational emotion is hatred; defined as an intense form of dislike, it is far more dangerous to the one who hates than to the object of the hatred. h a T R e d , T h e i R R a T i o n a l e m o T i o n No one can hate and be healthy at the same time. It is es - sentially human for a person to dislike those who have injured him, filched his worldly goods, or frustrated his reasonable ac - complishments. The other person’s fault may be great, but the one who hates him, no matter how just the cause, has the fault which is the greater. The Scriptural admonition, to do good to those who despite-fully use us, is not only a noble statement of spiritual truth, but a cardinal tenet of psychotherapy. It has been my observation that most persons regard their hatreds as righteous emotions, and they have no particular de - sire to get over them. They seem to feel that through dislike they accomplish a vicarious revenge. To work up an implacable"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"The Point of Conscious Awareness 235 hatred may require many years of brooding over real or imagi - nary ills, so that when this is achieved it is not unusual to learn that the despised one has departed, long since, from this mortal life. The ancient custom of forgiving the dead, and burying all grievances with the body, was not so much a kindness to the deceased, as a release for the living. Energy expended in perpetuating grudges is not available for positive accomplishments, and those who hate impoverish themselves with their destructive emotions. A philosophical at - titude toward life and people is a good remedy for hate fixa - tions. An old doctor, who had spent sixty years studying human nature in all its complex manifestations, once said to me; “1 am entirely convinced, from a lifetime of experience and observa - tion, that every man does the best he can, for what he is and what he knows.” The student of psychology becomes tolerant of people and their faults. He realizes that under similar motivations, and limited by the same training, circumstances, and traditions, he in all probability would make the identical mistakes that appear so despicable in others. No man is ever hurt as badly by what is done to him, as by his own mental and emotional reactions to the injury. On one occasion, the Greek philosopher Diogenes was insulted outra - geously by an ignorant soldier who publicly spat in his face; The great Skeptic was silent for a moment, and then observed with a smile, “I realize that I should be properly incensed by this un - warranted act, but addiction to wisdom and love of man have taken away my temper, and I know not how to be angry.” Hate is a destructive fixation of the point of attention. If the fixation is too intense for the individual to overcome by the power of his own will, suggestion therapy is indicated. In extreme cases hypnotic therapy is helpful. There are instances in which the person hated has become the patient’s best friend,"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"236 Healing, the Divine Art once the complex was broken. It is possible to hate anyone if only that person’s faults are seen, and conversely it is equally possible to like anyone, after becoming aware of his virtues. Particularly difficult aversion complexes can result from marital incompatibility, endured over a long period of time. Small irritations, lovingly fostered, develop into hate, and even loathing. It is a tragic mistake to permit human relationships to degenerate into domestic chaos. The wiser course is for the couple to acknowledge the failure, break up the marriage, and part as friends. Even if there are children, separation may be the better way. Inharmony in the home will blight the psyche of the small child, and so perpetuate the parental complexes in the next generation. T h e s e v e n k i n d s o f l o v e Love is the most mysterious of human emotions. According to the teachings of the Platonists, there are seven kinds of love: the love of man and woman; the love of parent and child; the love of friend for friend; the love of beauty; the love of good; the love of wisdom; and the love of God. In this concatenation is a gradual ascent of the emotional point of attention from the personal, through the impersonal, to the spiritual. All the physical aspects of love include strong personal at - tachment to the object of the affection, and this attachment easily intensifies to the degree of a fixation. The emotion of possession also is stimulated, and frequently is mistaken for fondness. The desire to possess or to be possessed is present in most forms of human affection, and its absence is regarded as abnormal. The tendency in modern psychology is to rationalize the emotional processes, and to seek natural explanations for at - tachments and antipathies. A considerable amount of evidence"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"The Point of Conscious Awareness 237 has been accumulated to prove that love is the result of subcon - scious impulses originating in the personality pattern. The love nature is formed in childhood and rarely changes in later years. If the parental home has been reasonably harmonious, the chil - dren will fall in love with persons reminiscent of their parents in appearance or temperament. The boys will select wives re - sembling their mother, and the girls will select husbands re - sembling their father. If the childhood home is unhappy, or the parents die, or the children are reared by other relatives, then the dominant personalities in the lives of the children will sup - ply the types for which there will be a later affinity. A daughter born to an elderly but delightfully companion - able father, might have no interest in boys of her own age, marry a man twenty-five years her senior and be quite happy. One boy who adored his crippled sister, married a charming but physi - cally frail young woman, and is rapturously happy ministering to her comforts. In cases like these is the indication that we prefer to continue throughout life in the familiar patterns that were pleasant in our childhood days. Unfortunately, we can be disappointed. For we may fall in love with a resemblance, only to discover that no two persons are alike, and the resemblance is a delusion when we have to live with the dissimilarities, Extreme possessiveness is the most disastrous consequence of ardent attachment. It is almost impossible to feel possessive - ness without the impulse to dominate. There are no happy end - ings for the situations set up by domination. If, for example, a strong willed parent fails to succeed in dominating a child, the parent is miserable; but if domination is achieved the child’s life is ruined. Possessive parents are a serious menace to the future of their children. Widowed mothers are likely offenders, espe - cially if there is but one child. If the child is a son, he will be in grave danger of becoming a homosexual; and if it is a daughter she may remain unmarried, and her entire personal life become a futile sacrifice to a selfish mother’s comfort and happiness."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"238 Healing, the Divine Art There is in practice a fine point where possessiveness ceases to be a delightful and heart-warming form of amative flattery, and becomes a disagreeable and destructive kind of tyranny. The younger generation is too independently minded to permit such a state of affairs, but a number of such cases have come to my attention concerned with persons beyond middle life. A woman fifty-five years old, suffering from a variety of frustrations and profoundly neurotic, suspected that the cause of her unhappiness was a dominating husband. In their thirty- two years of married life he had never permitted her to select her own clothes, leave the house without him, have any close friends, visit her family, express a personal like or dislike; she was not allowed to learn to drive a car, she was given no pin money , could not vote according to the dictates of her own con - science, attend the church in which she had been reared, or have anything to say about the education of their children. The one opportunity she had to come to me was when her delight - ful spouse was in the hospital with a well-merited touch of gall- bladder. This of course is an extreme case, but in many homes the condition exists to some degree. Buddha pointed out, twenty-five centuries ago, that posses - siveness is the principal cause of sorrow. The dictionary defines sorrow as suffering or sadness arising from loss or disappoint - ment. Loss is impossible without the sense of possession, and disappointment can be the loss or failure of something expected. Loss of physical goods possessed results in poverty, and loss of persons possessed results in loneliness, which is poverty of com - panionship. It is a sad but common mistake to invest oneself so completely in others that the loss of these persons destroys the reason and purpose for our own existence. Realizing how dependent we have become upon those we love, our natural instinct is to hold on to them regardless of cost. When, as must happen, they finally leave us, our sorrow is uncontrollable, and"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"The Point of Conscious Awareness 239 nothing remains but to live on with our memories. The only solution to this problem is to build a personal existence which can survive the loss of the external in persons and things. It is not to be expected that the emotional life of the average person will be entirely satisfactory. Yet any serious departure from the normalcy pattern of humankind leads to tragic con - sequences. Nature has ordained that men and women should establish homes, bring children into the world, prepare them for life according to ability and estate, and then release them to establish their own lives. To depart from this simple cos - mic scheme of things, regardless of the motives, is to increase the hazards of living and open oneself to dangerous complexes, fixations, frustrations, and neuroses. When the emotional life has been frustrated, it is according to rule that the inhibited person should turn either to religion, or seek relief through gratification of ambition. The sufferer may fall heels-over-head into some strange cult, engage in phil - anthropic enterprises, join a club devoted to higher criticism, or become suddenly conscious of civic mismanagement. The process by which the neurotic becomes ‘spiritual’ is summed up tersely in a statement made to me some years ago by a promi - nent member of a metaphysical sect. “My husband divorced me,” she moaned; “then I lost my money through a bad investment; my children have all left me, my health is poor, and so having nothing left to live for, I gave myself to God.” It hadn’t occurred to this lady that she would be no more valuable to the Deity than she had been to the members of her own family.

Without concurring in this opinion, it is useful to know why doctors"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"240 Healing, the Divine Art of the mind come to such a conclusion. Theirs is a good sound argument, substantially as follows: Most of those who take refuge in religion are running away from factual situations which they lack the courage to face. The Balm which is in Gilead is to them just a salve for bruises of the ego. As escapists, they should be inspired to go back into the world, meet their problems, solve them, and reestablish self-confidence and poise. While they nestle in the arms of the Lord these unhappy but well-meaning folk are only exchanging vagaries for ineptitude. The present state of many religious movements wholly justi - fies the viewpoint of the psychologist, and the factual material he has gathered can not be overthrown by sentimental opposi - tion or by howls of heresy. The fault is in modern religions, especially those of the West, having divorced themselves from the great systems of spiritual philosophy which were the foun - dations of the faiths. Julian the Apostate, noblest of the Roman Emperors, attacked the early Church for this very fault and returned to the gods of his fathers. The substance of Julian’s Oration Against the Christians can be summed up in a few lines: No man is worthy to enter a place of worship unless his mind is devoted to learning, his heart to virtuous emotions and his body to good works. God rejoices not in sinners but in just men, not in the foolish but in the wise, not in the well-meaners but in the well-doers. Only when men put their own lives in order is it proper for them to approach the House of God. The temple is defamed if men come only to beg favors; the pious should come giving thanks for the beauty of the world and the universal Good that governs all created things. i n T e l l i g e n c e a n d i n T e l l e c T When the center of awareness is posited in the mental na - ture of the human being, thought dominates both emotion and"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"The Point of Conscious Awareness 241 action. Understanding of thought dominance requires defini - tion of intelligence and intellect. The popular conception is, intelligence is intellect in operation. It seems to me, that the two words signify entirely different states of the mind. Intelligence is the power to perceive the nature of externals in their relationship to ourselves. It is the ability to discern the inter-relationships of presented facts as they may affect us. And it is the aptitude to meet unexpected situations by appropriate personality adjustments. Intelligence arises from experience and observation, and is present sometimes in a marked degree among those who are without benefit of formal education. There is little to indicate that schooling can bestow intelligence; scholastic training is even likely to prove damaging to basic intelligence. Intellect, to me, represents intelligence that has been condi - tioned by formal education. An intellectual person is one who has acquired various forms of knowledge, and who makes use of these rather than native intelligence in the solution of his problems. As a great part of so-called knowledge is merely ac - credited opinion, with little foundation in fact, the intellectu - alist may be over-well versed in fallacies. The educated man is the one most likely to involve his life in destructive complica - tions. He lacks the ability, so evident among primitive people, to think simply and directly. Artificial values divert his atten - tion, and his conclusions lose the name of action. It is unfortunate that we must unlearn much that has been taught to us as sober truth before we can put our lives in order. The intellectual man, limited by his learning, is helpless in the presence of the unknown. The intelligent man, because he has not been narrowed by formalized training, applies common sense to the abstruse problem and generally finds a solution. One of the commonest tricks of the intellectualist is to substitute words for ideas. He will argue with words in lieu of"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"242 Healing, the Divine Art thoughts, then consider himself victorious if he has out-talked his opponent. While it seems to have been the medieval Scholastics who discovered that long words in a strange language are an ex - cellent means of concealing ignorance, yet when some learned man today calls a dandelion a l’araxacum officinale, we are apt to suspect that he has a profound knowledge of the plant. It is well to remember that names can be memorized with no particular benefit, but thoughts must arise from diligent and intelligent consideration of facts. The intellectualist has the type of mind that can deteriorate easily into a tumbling ground for whimsies. Straight thinking is rare in our time, and common sense the most uncommon of the senses. Many psychological difficulties have their origin in the effort to live in harmony with some immature system of opinions. Everyone has opinions and to their owners these notions are vitally significant, worthy to be passed on as a price - less heritage unto their issue. To differ with a man’s opinions is a grave social error, not easily forgiven. But, opinions are of importance no greater than the mental achievements of the person who has them; and they are most abundant where the ability is the slightest. Even your own opinions on any matter are not to be taken by yourself too seriously unless you know you are thoroughly informed on the subject. m o T i o n s o f T h e m e n T a l P o i n T o f a T T e n T i o n Three basic attitudes, interest, indifference, and apprecia - tion, control the motions of the mental point of attention. Each human being has a personal sphere of interests. With most of us, these interests follow the lines of the familiar. The moment we depart from the familiar we realize inadequacy, and this realization, outraging the ego, stimulates fear and doubt. This"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"The Point of Conscious Awareness 243 explains the human tendency to dislike, oppose, and condemn that which is new or different. The pattern of the childhood home, and the doctrines and attitudes inculcated there; the public school, with its emphasis upon certain cultural and economic standards; the university, with its specialized curricula for various professions; the church, with its long established dogma and tradition; and finally, the occupation selected as a livelihood—all these contribute to the reference frame of familiar things and direct interest. Experi - ence, which results from the application of formulas to facts, rounds out the pattern and bestow the finished viewpoint. As an attitude, indifference is lack of interest, which in turn is lack of awareness. That which is beyond our experience is beyond our comprehension. The center of attention passes over the unfamiliar without pause, Or selects only the familiar ele - ments in an otherwise uninteresting compound. There is an old saying that a shoemaker will look at all men’s feet, and the haberdasher sees only their hats and ties. Appreciation is a generalized awareness of certain matters beyond the sphere of specialized attention. A person may en - joy music without technical knowledge, and he may respect accomplishment in fields far removed from his own achieve - ments. The impulse to appreciate is highly constructive, and is an indication of mental refinement. In most persons, the center of mental awareness shifts with the interests of the day and the passing moods of the individual. There is little intensity of realization, and even less continuity of purpose. Things seen are not remembered; experiences add little to the sum of knowledge; and opportunities go unrec - ognized. The inability to control the wanderings of the point of attention, is just as surely a form of sickness as the inability to control the functions of the body. Persons lacking internal organization cannot be healthy, and most of them are suffering from nervous ailments which bear witness to inconsistencies"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"244 Healing, the Divine Art in habits and thoughts. Few Occidentals even realize that it is possible to control either the mind or the emotions. They as - sume that it is necessary to obey every urge, and fulfill every whim, merely because they have the impulse. The opposite extreme is the one-track mind. In this case the awareness is dominated by a fixation that places arbitrary limi - tations upon the perceptions. The one-track mind has certain advantages from a financial and intellectual standpoint, and many of our successful industrialists and scientists suffer from this ailment. When we think of success, however, we must re - member that it is quite possible to succeed admirably in the economic world and fail utterly in our personal lives. And it is this personal failure that destroys us in the end. T h e d e s T R u c T i v e n e s s o f w o R R y Worry, which is intellectualized fear, is one of the most popular of man’s destructive mental habits. Worry and the common cold are equally difficult to cure. The chronic worrier is forever imagining the worst, and then suffering in propor - tion to the magnitude of the expected evil. There is no univer - sal remedy for worry, no simple formula by which the mind can be released from its anxiety complex. It is useless to tell a person not to worr y, a nd it does little good to solve his problem for him. He will direct his attention to some other concern and continue in the same anxiety mechanism. The story of the man who was deeply concerned because there was nothing to worry about at the moment, is no exaggeration. The economic factor contributes many worries in the life of the average person. The uncertainties which afflict us all are particularly difficult to the anxious type of mind. Many feel that they have not accepted their share of the common woe unless they worry industriously about private and public mat - ters. An old lady once said to me, “But I don’t want to stop my"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"The Point of Conscious Awareness 245 worries; I’d be miserable without something to worry about.” Worry causes internal suffering, and suffering makes us feel important, a little akin to the martyrs of the olden days. It is difficult to estimate the full degree of damage that is done to the physical body by the worry habit. Vitality is low - ered, function depressed, and even the organic structure may be seriously affected. The survival of the individual in a state of reasonable health, and his ability to lead a useful and happy life, depend upon a constructive mental attitude, and to achieve this he must overcome the tendency to excessive worry. In treat - ment, religion and philosophy help more than psychology; the sufferer must develop a viewpoint toward life in which faith in good is stronger than fear of evil. d e m o R a l i z i n g R e m o R s e Remorse is another demoralizing mental attitude, in which the center of awareness is centered in old regrets, to the detri - ment of present efforts. It is curious, but true, that those who have committed serious offenses are not always the most re - morseful. The fixation is apt to select some inconsequential mistake, and dwell upon it until it becomes an obsession. If, actually, a person has been guilty of some large fault, the only way to balance the books of his life is to compensate for the delinquency by other gallant and noble actions. A case came to me of a woman who was so remorseful over an early love affair, in which she had been responsible for trage - dy, that she made two subsequent husbands miserable for years with her sighs and moans. Every man makes mistakes, but if he accepts their lessons and goes on enriched by experience, these same mistakes, in the end, can make the man."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"246 Healing, the Divine Art e g o T i s m a n d e g o i s m No consideration of mental pathology would be complete without a few words on the subject of egotism. Here a distinc - tion might be made that is not clearly indicated in the dic - tionary. I would define egoism as self-awareness; and egotism as excessive self-awareness. The ego is the self recognized as distinct from other selves, and egoism is the natural result of this realization. Psychologically speaking, the acceptance of the concept of the separate self leads to the impulse to protect or preserve individual existence. This brings into play the much abused libido , which is not necessarily the sexual nature but is better defined merely as the primitive will to live. The quality of egoism is present as an equation in most hu - man action, and is responsible for the greater part of progress, personal and collective. Because we are , we can do, and we can have, we can achieve—yes, even, we can renounce, we can sac - rifice, and we can die. It is said that no man can give more than himself. It is egoism that makes possible this supreme unself - ishness. We exist. Religion teaches us to exist morally, philosophy to exist ethically, and science to exist efficiently. With the sense of self comes the solemn determination to protect the dignity of our being. Plato permitted suicide to those who could no lon - ger protect the honorable estate of the internal principle. The Oriental philosopher is not burdened by the concept of the ego, because he does not believe in the reality of the per - sonality complex. To him, all subjective life is universal; and the perfect human accomplishment is the overcoming of the delusion of separate existence. It seems therefore, that egoism is the burden of the West, the peculiar responsibility of the Occi - dental. Certainly, self-awareness is at the root of our entire the - ory of life, manifested to the full in our competitive system of economics. Herein lies the cause of rugged individualism, and"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"The Point of Conscious Awareness 247 the sincere, but sometimes unpleasant belief, that men must go on, age after age, struggling desperately to excel in wealth, position, or accomplishment. A moderate amount of egoism is necessary in the life of the average man, to preserve him from the encroachment of other ambitious persons. But there is little to indicate that egocentric - ity contributes much to happiness or good health. In our time, personal ambition has become a dangerous disease in its own right; and, by aggravating other ailments, it contributes exten - sively to bodily infirmity. Most successful men are sick. Egoism, unless tempered by the moderating influence of wisdom, gradually changes into egotism, which is self-obses - sion. The consciousness is focused on the fact of self, and the result is an offensive self-conceit. The condition may develop even further and produce a kind of mania, such as is evident in the lives of tyrants, despots, and dictators. The divinity com - plex is about the last stage of egotism, and causes the delusion of divine power and authority to arise in a personality least suited for a God-like career. Most world conquerors who have drenched the earth with the blood of their fellow creatures have suffered from the divinity complex. Pride, arrogance, the desire to possess, the will to dominate, the urge to impress others with our superiority, and the willing - ness to sacrifice the good of those about us to our own inter - ests, are common and often justified forms of egotism. Society has a tendency to reward those who have a high opinion of themselves, and to penalize the modest man. But the evidence remains, that egotism is a destructive mental attitude, and each person must decide for himself, either to do that which is best for his happiness and security, or suffer through a compromise of his standards to meet the stupidity of the world. There is another form of egotism that manifests through a variety of negative attitudes. Constant self-censure, exaggerat - ed humility, over-obvious modesty, some types of shyness and"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"248 Healing, the Divine Art timidity, radical departures from conventions, and the public depreciation of one’s own abilities, are all evidences of self-con - sciousness. The normal person is the one who is not conscious of self, and therefore does not need to extol or condemn himself or his actions. Considerable space has been devoted to this problem be - cause it plays such an important part in the health of men and women. Wherever the point of conscious awareness is posited, there will be stress and tension; and these forces are violently detrimental to normal function. When the focus of attention is upon the self, the individual cannot be natural, and he cannot relax. Life becomes a frantic struggle to satisfy ego-ambition, or to justify mistakes. These are as frequent, often more so, in the lives of egotists as in the careers of less intensive persons. The man who will never change his mind, because to change it is to admit that he has been wrong in the past, is bound to have trouble both with his disposition and his digestion. And not in much better condition is the befuddled mortal who told me that he dared not acknowledge his errors for fear that he would lose faith in himself. The egotist is forever pretending to be more than he is, which makes for a most uncomfortable state of affairs for all lives concerned with his. The tension caused by egocentricity can prevent the very ac - complishments that mean so much to the self-centered person. An old Chinese saying maintains that the man who works for glory never does his work well. It is the man who labors for the joy of the labor who comes in the fullness of time to the fame deserved. When this happens he is hated by those who have done little themselves, the egotists who resent the greatness of other men.

It may be true that every man is a potential god; but if he overworks this potential without evolving it into a true potency, he is in a fair way to develop a divinity complex. My case histories include several dealing with persons who believed, soberly, that they were God, and by this delusion, ruined their lives. Some have told me of long conversations held with Deity, and how He had appointed them to correct the evils of the world. Others think they are great Initiates, possessed of ce - lestial wisdom, acquired through degrees bought in fraudulent organizations; or because they have vastly overestimated some personal psychic experiences which they did not understand. Still others were party to esoteric secrets that would change the whole course of civilization, and their ‘masters’ had so in - formed them. In possession of such stupendous knowledge, these persons become puffed up with their own importance, egos distended to the bursting point. I have watched some of these cases over a period of many years, and not one of these poor deluded men and women had made the slightest contribu - tion to human progress. Most religious organizations depreciate the beliefs of other groups, and sometimes evolve elaborate explanations to sustain their prejudices. Each cult assumes its own infinite superiority, and this attitude is passed on to the membership as justification for the complex of spiritual aristocracy. As a result, the devotees come to look with smug pity upon those unfortunate mortals who have not the vision to join the self-elected.

When a man has done nothing himself of which he can rea - sonably be proud, he is likely to fall back upon family, nation, or race, for the stuff with which to bolster up his ego. While it may be comforting to have illustrious forebears, or to belong to a dominant racial strain, personal superiority cannot be in - herited or vicariously conferred. Confucius defined a superior man, not as one born to high estate, or of the ruling class or race, but as one who was above the performance of an inferior action under any condition. Unfortunately, there is very little that can be done to help the chronic egotist, for the reason that he refuses to admit any fault in himself or his ideas. He always blames his numerous misfortunes on other persons and other causes, and often takes the attitude that all the world is to blame for his unhappiness. Only the laws of karma and reincarnation can work out his problem, and it may take many lives of pain and sorrow to break down the ego-complex. If the tendency to inflated ego appears in small children it should be broken up at once, before it has a chance to become established.

A number of patients have told me that their psy - choanalysis would have been much more useful to them if the psychologist had been more idealistic and philosophical in his recommendations. Most persons suffering from personality and character de - fects are profoundly ignorant of the simple truths of construc - tive living. They have lost impersonal perspective, and their own problems are magnified entirely out of proportion with their true values. They are confused, disillusioned, and discour - aged. They fear the world because it has hurt them; and they fear themselves because of the internal weaknesses that have brought on past and present misfortunes. For these muddled ones, a few simple, usable directions are far more practical than profound psychological formulas, difficult to understand. For such as these, I would offer the following summary of basic truths which apply to health and happiness. T e n c o m m a n d s f o R R i g h T l i v i n g Thou shalt not worry, for by so doing thou shalt suffer the same disaster many times. Thou shalt not try to dominate or possess others, for it is the right of every man to govern his own actions. Thou shalt not desire after fame, for the burdens of great - ness are an affliction unto the spirit. Thou shalt not desire after great wealth, for there is no peace in the lives of the rich. 1 2 3 4"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"252 Healing, the Divine Art Thou shalt relax, for great tension is an abomination unto the flesh. Thou shalt have a sense of humor, or thy years will seem much longer and more painful in the land. Thou shalt love the beautiful and serve the good, for this is according to the Will of Heaven. Thou shalt harm no other person, by word, or thought or deed, regardless of the cause; for to do so is to perpetuate the sorrows of the race. Thou shalt not be angry at any person for any reason, for anger injures most the one who is angry.

In ancient times, the secret sciences of nature and the esoteric parts of religion and philosophy were closely guarded in the Temples of the Gods, by orders of initiated priests. A young man resolved to dedicate his life to the service of the Mysteries, had first to secure letters from the elders of his city and the teachers of his preparatory school; these credentials tes - tified to his outstanding character and scholastic ability. They were issued only after a complete investigation of his family background and his own conduct from early childhood. And the applicant had to prove proficiency in at least three arts or sciences, usually mathematics, astronomy, and music. When the candidate for admission to the Temple had pre - sented his recommendations to the priests, he was further ex - amined as to his bodily perfection, moral integrity, and devo - tion to learning. If he passed these tests with sufficiently high honors, he was admitted to the class of neophytes, to begin his term of formal instruction."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"254 Healing, the Divine Art The period of study and testing lasted from five to ten years, according to the rules of the particular order. At any time dur - ing this period the neophyte might be dismissed if he lacked the required aptitudes. At the end of his novitiate, the disciple was expected to take the grand tour. Unless wars made the journey impossible, he visited the Mystery Temples of various districts and countries, studying for a time at each of the Sanctuaries. Finally, at the discretion of the Hierophant of his own Temple, the neophyte was informed that he might attempt the initiation. The initiatory drama was divided into several parts. Select - ed priests questioned the candidate to prove his knowledge in every branch of the sacred sciences. He was turned over to an - other group of initiators who tested his fortitude, and his moral and physical courage, in tests which exposed him to a series of real and imaginary dangers. If he failed in any of these trials the neophyte disappeared forever from the sight of men. The last part of the ritual was a magnificent religious pag - eant, given in the great theatre of the Mysteries. The candidate was accepted into the Brotherhood of the Twice Born, he was embraced by the Master of the House, who also bestowed the ‘new name’ and the insignia of the Order. The new initiate was then instructed in the final secrets of the adytum, and admon - ished to go forth from this inner shrine and devote his life to the service of mankind. m i s i n T e R P R e T a T i o n a n d m i s u s e o f k n o w l e d g e These elaborate precautions were not imposed by any self - ish desire on the part of the priests to prevent the spread of wisdom; they were dictated by two important considerations: The first was to prevent the misinterpretation of knowledge by the uninformed.

It requires many years of study, devotion, and self-discipline to fit the life and the mind for the abstractions of metaphysical philosophy. It is a popular modern conceit that knowledge belongs to whomsoever can discover it, by any means, fair or foul. The initiated priests of the elder rites held to a different conviction. They taught that knowledge belongs only to those who can use it wisely. The most difficult of all the arts and sciences is reli - gion, because it deals with intangibles; few indeed are the land - marks among familiar things to guide and direct the truth- seeker; his dependence must be upon the strength of his own vision, and the basic integrity of his own viewpoint to protect him from the perils of abstract contemplation. The old temples are now gone from the Western world: the priesthoods which guarded the shrines have vanished away; and the secret doctrines of long ago have become the religious fads of modern times. And now, after the lapse of ages, the thoughtful observer is beginning to understand why the old priests refused to give their spiritual secrets to the untutored world. The Occidental has an especially hard time trying to keep his spiritual values straight. There is little in his environment or experience that can help him. He has been educated in material matters, but is as ignorant as a new-born babe when it comes to superphysical problems. But in Asiatic countries, mysticism is still a living force, and most educated Orientals have a working knowledge of the so-called esoteric sciences.

Self-styled psycholo - gists were explaining to enchanted audiences how dollars float - ed about in space, hunting for pockets to fall into, and the secret of success was to push out the chest, firmly, against the reverse side of the third vest button. Metaphysical teachers in flowing gowns of pastel hues taught spontaneous precipitation of prosperity, and led their enthusiastic followers in meditation, visualization, realization, holding the thought, and treating for power. Turbaned Orientals, masquerading as Yogis, involved their disciples in hopeless confusion; and when things were nicely out of hand, moved on to other pastures. This was indeed the heyday of the cults, and the inmates of Old Bethlehem Madhouse were addicted to no wilder notions than those which then occupied the minds of sober American students of new thought. Weird cults, large and small, sprang up like mushrooms in the night. There was no rule or reason in the various teachings, all were pronounced inspired, and each contradicted the others. A totally uninformed public selected as best it could from the wide display of offerings. None knew enough to justify his own choice, or aid others in their dilem - ma.

Those were the days when housewives were deep in spiri - tual alchemy, and maiden aunts made solemn pronouncements after two weeks in astrology. The local tailor was a Rosicru - cian of high degrees, and the neighborhood grocer a Gnostic Illuminist.

The very condition which the old initiates had feared came to blase America with all its deadly force. Mankind makes lovable mistakes at times, and this was one of the times. The truth-seekers of that day were earnest and sincere, but they could not succeed; they lacked both wisdom and understanding. How could Mrs. Smith, who put up excel - lent quince preserves, realize that it was not possible to master the secrets of the Cabala in ten easy correspondence lessons? She had never heard of the Cabala until she took those lessons, and did not dream that the most learned of Hebrew scholars approached the great Mystery of the Cabalistic Splendors with fear and trembling, and devoted a lifetime of prayer, medita - tion, and study to a few verses of its sacred books. Many sects were founded in these troubled Nineteen-Twen - ties. Some were created by honest well-meaning folk totally un - prepared to cope with the consequences of organization and the complications which always arise in man-made institu - tions. Most of these sects were short-lived, and were destroyed by their own internal bickering. Other groups were started by thoroughly dishonest men who had no interest beyond the golden opportunity to become rich off the faith and credulity of their followers. These false leaders were definitely criminals, and the damage they have done in the lives of human beings is beyond estimation. The Great Depression ended most of the lesser cults, but some have survived to perpetuate the confusion. For years it has been one of my jobs to salvage the products of false religious teachings.

This basic dif - ficulty is aggravated further by that unsettled state of mind which causes metaphysicians to wander from one belief to another, accumulating a mass of unrelated notions. As indi - gestible food results in physical stomach trouble, so indigestive thoughts and ideas result in mental dyspepsia. Once the mind loses its contact with those simple certainties which protect the normal person, the power of direct and solutional thought is lost, and the whole mental nature degenerates into vagary.

But this is only the beginning of his misfortunes. Black magicians will hound him the rest of his days; evil spirits will plague his sleep and malicious forces will steal away his goods. Even the eternal being of the meta - physical heretic is threatened with divers calamities. One group warned that to leave their order was to be set back two-hundred incarnations in spiritual evolution. Another sect warned that only members in good standing would be permitted to see the second coming of Christ. Some leaders have gone so far as to hint, broadly, that they will destroy with occult powers any followers who attempt to depart from their holy ministrations. Thus does the old fear of the devil and his agencies rise again in modern mystical movements, and so are most metaphysicians loaded with fears, primitive terrors with a thin veneer of new thought. With most cultists of today, the belief in the miraculous has taken away common sense. Trivial circumstances take on deep esoteric meaning. Persons have phoned me in the middle of the night to report a strange scratching sound under the floor near the bed. Is this noise caused by a Mahatma? Or do I think it possible that an initiation is pending? Or are the elementals at work again? Then, with a quaver in the voice, comes the inevi - table question: Is it some evil force come to destroy? If you assure the terrified one that a mouse under the floor would explain the situation quite nicely, and if he then accepts your explanation-which is rare-relief is mingled with disap - pointment.

Experience proves that genuine occult phenomena are ex - ceedingly rare; and physical suffering due to such causes is equally rare. Obsession, spirit possession, black magic, psychic persecution, vampirism, undue occult influence, malicious magnetism, elemental annoyances, and destructive vibrations are the more common forms of occult ailments. We may con - cede that such phenomena do exist, since history supports such a belief, tradition further sustains it, and experience confirms the testimonies. But we can also realize that not one in five hun - dred cited cases actually involves any superphysical factors. Imagination, distorted by erroneous religious teaching, is responsible for a wide variety of curious manifestations that appear supernatural to the individual who has lost his sense of values. The man who reads Sinistrari’s Demonologia far into the night is quite likely to dream of demons, and see an assemblage of imps leering at him from the foot-rail of his bed. After a few weeks study of kundalini and the spirit-fire in the spine, the novice is almost certain to feel strange currents moving through his body and imagine he is on the verge of cosmic-con - sciousness. Soon after learning of the existence of Masters and Adepts, it should not be surprising if the overwhelmed student dreams of these great ones, and then announces proudly that he has left his body and gone to a temple in the high Himala - yas. The imagination is ready always to supply the substance for things hoped for and longed after. The psychic phenomena reported on every hand cannot be genuine; the students are not sufficiently advanced nor in - formed to have such experiences.

The simplest method of showing how metaphysical or pseu - do-metaphysical ailments should be diagnosed and treated is by reference to case histories. They allow the reader to examine the evidence for himself and to discover how easily the human mind becomes a victim of mystical hallucinations. All of these records are authentic, but names and unimportant details have been slightly altered to protect the sufferers from embarrass - ment. To work successfully with problems of this kind the practi - tioner needs broad, general knowledge of his subject and three specialized qualifications. First, he should be a good listener, never shocked by revelations, capable of evaluating evidence, and as a professional consultant not be susceptible to false in - terpretation of conditions which the patient himself has come to believe. Second, he must possess a certain gift for strategy, so that the patient will not depart in a huff when told the un - romantic basis of his case.

One patient ex - plained at great length how he had been attacked by evil forces while in a state of amnesia, with terrible consequences extend - ing over a period of years. The story was convincing except on one point, the poor man could not remember when the amne - sia occurred! Another miserable old gentleman believed that several wicked magicians had invented a kind of radio that sent out destructive vibrations. The full force of this machine was being centered upon him; he was sure of this because he could hear the buzzing of the instrument day and night. It took a world of argument to persuade this deluded person that he was afflicted with buzzing from nothing worse than an attack of catarrh. T h e c a s e o f T h e s c a R a b R i n g Late one afternoon Mrs. Mary Annett laid on my office desk a massive and ornate ring containing a large beetle cut from blue stone. She sat down, folded her hands on the edge of the blotter, and exclaimed with great agitation, “Can you help me to get rid of this cursed thing?” Slowly, and with consider - able difficulty she told her sad story. Mary had been studying the occult sciences for a number of years with several teachers and groups. At last she had found her true teacher, a ‘perfectly wonderful’ master who admitted that he was the only living initiate of the mysteries of Karnac, So it came about that Mary completely immersed herself in pseudo- Egyptian metaphysics. Then, one day several months earlier, this good lady had been ‘drawn’ by some psychic force into a little second hand store, and there was this “perfectly wonder - ful” old Egyptian scarab ring. It cost only a song, “because it"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Ailments Psychical and Pseudo-Psychical 263 was meant for her,” and the dealer “had no idea of its value.” She had worn the ring only for a few days when she discovered that the scarab had “perfectly wonderful” vibrations. Now, it so happened that Mrs. Annett had a friend and fel - low student who was a ‘perfectly wonderful psychometrist; and one evening the two believers went to work on the ring. After an appropriate procedure the occult divinator announced that the scarab had belonged to an ancient Egyptian priestess, who had been buried alive in the vaults of the temple, because she had dared to oppose the will of an evil magician. There was even the possibility that friend Mary was a reincarnation of the ill-starred priestess. It was all ‘perfectly wonderful,’ but not for long. A few nights later Mary Annett had a vision, The wicked Egyptian magician appeared in the dead of night and the sim - ple drama assumed melodramatic proportions. The deceased sorcerer laughed fiendishly and pointing a ghostly finger at ter - rified Mrs. Annett told her that the ring was cursed, and that so long as she wore it her soul belonged to his evil purposes. Then to complete the fatal picture, he further threatened that if ever she attempted to dispose of the scarab he would destroy her, body and soul. The vision returned night after night, and all manner of mi - nor misfortune had followed upon the curse. Her pet dog had mysteriously died, then the family pocketbook disappeared, a sister had an accident, and soon after, Mrs. Annett herself be - came the victim of a strange sick spell. She had gone to her teacher, the still ‘perfectly wonderful’ man from Karnac, to be told by him that the condition was very serious, for Egyptian death-curses defied the highest mag - ic of the modern world. Long before the story with all its lurid details was finished these certain things were evident: There was not one bit of genu - ine psychic phenomena involved in any part of the happenings."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"264 Healing, the Divine Art The ring was not cursed; there had never been any priestess; the wicked magician was an illusion; the psychometrist friend had erupted in a violent outburst of imagination; the reported misfortunes were ordinary occurrences, falsely involved in the story; and last, .but not least by any means, the ‘perfectly won - derful’ master from Karnac was a fraud—or he would have found out the truth by one or another of his marvelous occult powers. Fortunately the proof was conclusive, and Mrs. Annett went home happy. She had no more trouble with phantoms but experienced a highly dramatic moment when she stopped off to tell the man from Karnac what was on her mind. The only level-headed person in the case proved to be the second hand store dealer, and with him the amateur detection technique came into the diagnosis. My first glance at the ring told me that the scarab was a fake, one of thousands made in Italy during the last twenty-five years; counterfeits which are sold all over the world as genuine but at a price far below the value of these comparatively rare Egyptian signets. One glance and inquiry as to what she had paid for the scarab, established that the good lady’s strong vibrations could be only in her own mind. What really had happened to Mary Annett was this: She had Egypt on her mind, not the Egypt of the archeologist or antiquarian, but a fantastic, imaginary Egypt; one that existed only in the mind of a fraudulent metaphysical teacher. This un - worthy controlled his ignorant followers with ‘perfectly won - derful’ revelations, which he hatched whenever they served his purposes. All aflutter with these splendid fictions, Mrs. Annett was drawn to the ring, not by its vibrations but by her own exaggerated interest. The incompetent psychometrist supplied the stuff necessary for a definite hallucination. Mrs. Annett dreaming about the tale she had heard, mistook the dream for a vision.

The other complications followed as a matter of course. There are accounts of Egyptian curses which never have been explained satisfactorily, but fortunately, this was not one of those strange cases. The cause of Mary Annett’s months of fear and acute mental suffering was nothing but fraudulent in - struction in mystical beliefs. T h e c a s e o f T h e d e v i l ’ s w e a T h e R v a n e Tired little Mrs. Sarah Briswell looked for all the world like Whistler’s painting of his mother. Her narrative was to me es - pecially pathetic because so much of pain and misery had been brought to the closing years of a sweet and gentle life, which had been burdened enough without this added woe. It required several hours to hear her story, but the substance is as follows: Mrs. Briswell was approaching eighty, with her husband dead for fifteen years. After his death she had turned to meta - physics for comfort and consolation. She had attended many classes and had studied with nearly every lecturer who had vis - ited her community. One teacher in particular had made a profound impres - sion. This ‘wundermann’ was the self-styled first line of defense against the ‘dark forces’ that were bent on the destruction of mankind. Every cult but his own was in league with the devil; and even the heads of nations and states were really black ma - gicians determined to overthrow the world. The air was filled with evil vibrations, and a great dark monster hovered like some immense vampire bat above the earth. This horrible crea - ture waited to devour any who rejected the salvation offered by the ‘wundermann,’ in ten easy lessons, with an advanced course for the elect."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"266 Healing, the Divine Art Frightened out of her wits by this awful state of world af - fairs, aging little Sarah Briswell lived for years in constant fear. As second childhood came upon her, weakening mental fac - ulties were set in a hopeless phobia. She dared not leave her room in a cheap boarding house after dark for fear that some malicious force would destroy her. She recited magical formu - las every night to protect her immortal soul, and hung sacred pictures on the walls to keep away black magicians. Then the terrible thing happened. From her one little window on the third floor back, Sarah Briswell could look out over the roofs of the run-down neigh - borhood in which she lived. A few hundred feet away was a stately old mansion, heavily trimmed with the ginger-bread decorations of the Gay Nineties. On one corner of this preten - tious house was a round squat tower, and on top of this tower was an elaborate weather vane of wrought iron; Sarah Briswell was fascinated by the weather vane. One day as she was gazing at the ornate device, to her utter amazement the arrow turned slowly and pointed directly at her. Then, as the childish little woman expressed it, “Everything came to her in a flash.” The ancient dwelling was the headquarters of the black forces that were trying to destroy the world. The wicked sorcerers released their terrible magic through the point of the weather vane. Sometimes they pointed the iron arrow at her; and then she could feel the dreadful vibrations trying to kill her, because she was party to an awful secret. It was useless to explain that the arrow was turned by the wind. That sort of explanation is all right only for uninitiated mortals who do not realize that dark forces are plotting the ex - tinction of mankind. Nor did it help to point out that the house with the weather vane was not an ogre’s castle, but a cheap ho - tel where elderly men with small means rocked all day long on the rutted wooden porch.

Not a great deal could be done for Sarah Briswell. She was too old; her mind was too feeble to understand the truth about her own case. But a certain amount of psychological release re - sulted from the simple telling of her story. She had the personal comfort of feeling that her duty was done. For she turned over to me the task of saving the threatened world. With my assurance that the matter would be given all nec - essary consideration, Mrs. Briswell departed with a somewhat better attitude and a pathetic little scheme of her own. She, with all secrecy, was going to move to another house, where the evil forces could not find her. This is the only case of psychic persecution involving a weather vane in my files, but there are a large number of in - stances in which fear of evil beings has brought years of mental suffering. Unfortunately, the condition will continue just as long as fraudulent religious teachers, some of them mentally unbalanced themselves, are permitted in the name of religious tolerance to circulate false and destructive doctrines among their susceptible followers. T u R n a b o u T m a l e v o l e n c e Among the mental prosperity cults the persecution complex results from a fear that the very type of mental selfishness we are directing against others, may, in turn, be directed against ourselves. A man who was “holding the thought” for a rich relative to die and leave him a fortune, suddenly was certain that the wealthy uncle was sending equally malevolent mental vibrations in the direction of his evil-minded nephew. Here a bad conscience reaped its own reward. Education is no protection against complexes, once the in - tellect is undermined.

A physician in Santa Fe told me this curious case: One of his patients, a totally unschooled Mexican, was cursed by a bruja (witch), and told that he would die in one year to the day. The cursed man slowly failed in health, although he was without any physical ailment; and on the allotted day turned over in his bed and died—of fear. This man believed his life might have been saved had a Mexican boy with the name of Jose put on his clothes inside-out, and then ordered the witch to release her victim. Such are the workings of primitive psychology.

Sometimes the imposture is so perfect that only weeks of pa - tient research can uncover the facts. There is no conscious in - tent to deceive, but usually there is considerable wishful think - ing involved in the occurrences. Many persons turn to the psychic in times of grief or afflic - tion. Under such conditions the reasoning faculties have small opportunity to function. So intense is the general desire of hu - mankind to communicate with some loved one, that, particu - larly in bereavement, supernatural origin is attributed to the most trivial happenings.

Some of my case histories should prove of real value to thoughtful researchers In the field of psychical phe - nomena. T h e c a s e o f T h e P h a n T o m b R i d e g R o o m Mrs. Betty Larson and John had been married just one year. She was an attractive girl, graduated from a well-known university, and to all appearances level headed and practical. Betty had become interested in the occult through her mother, who was completely immersed in a cult that specialized in soul- mates. This was the only part of the teaching that had made much of an impression on the younger woman. John was an average American, twenty-five years old, sober, industrious, very much in love and a trifle dull. He had no interest in things mystical. If Betty had those ideas, it was all right with him. Mrs. Larson explained her problem simply and clearly. She was not passionately in love with John, but she did admire him sincerely and felt that they could be happy together. They had been married only about three months when their lives had been triangulated by a visitor from the other world. The appari - tion had appeared to Betty in the middle of the night, and she was positive, (they always are,) she was not asleep at the time. He was a young and handsome specter, costumed as of the romantic medieval period. In spirit voice he announced to the"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"270 Healing, the Divine Art young wife that she was his soul-mate, married to him forever in the inner world; and so she must divorce her husband, and remaining true to her spirit partner throughout life, they would be united forever after her death. “I don’t know what to do,” said Mrs. Larson. “John is a fine man, and all this has hurt him terribly. But my soulmate is everything I have ever dreamed of, and if we are ordained to be one, I must be true to him.” It had looked for a moment that this might be a real psychic problem, but Betty revealed the key to the whole matter when she said of her mysterious visitor that he was everything she had ever dreamed of. For that is exactly what he was—a dream. Like many other young girls, Betty in her teens had created in her own mind a romantic ideal of the man whom some day she would marry. Of course, it is rare that such a dream can be realized; and in her conscious mind Betty knew this. She mar - ried John as one who promised to be a satisfactory husband, though possessed of few of the attributes of her ideal type. But the subconscious mind remembered Prince Charming, and a half-belief in the doctrines of the’ soul-mate cult was sufficient to set up a mechanism which resulted in the young wife’s vi - sion. Imaginings of this sort can not endure the light of exposure, and Mrs. Larson had only to be made to realize that her spirit bridegroom was the personification of her childhood dream hero to see the entire process.

His is a case where it is quite possible that the trouble started with an actual psychical experience, but gradually de - veloped into a typical psychological delusion. The night after the Battle of Gettysburg, the Captain, ex - hausted and slightly wounded, threw himself on the ground under a small tree and fell into a deep trance-like sleep. Just be - fore dawn he was awakened by someone shaking him violently. Sitting up half dazed, the astonished officer saw a tall figure in shimmering white standing among the branches of the tree. The unearthly being spoke in a low sorrowful voice: “I died, and I did not want to die. I died yesterday on the field of Gettysburg, and now from the spirit world I can see the folly of war. Wars must cease, so that other innocent men shall not die as I have died. Wait, and watch, and pray; for in the fullness of time I will reveal to you the secret of everlasting peace among the nations of the earth. Through you all wars will end.” After these fateful words the specter disappeared. Perhaps it was a vision of some soldier who had died in bat - tle, or perhaps it was the whole revulsion mechanism to war set up in the subconscious mind of the Captain himself which caused the vision. The facts can never be known. But one thing is certain, the ghostly occurrence ruined the life of Captain Hartsell. Year after year he waited, and watched, and prayed; and many times the spirit appeared to him in his dreams, always promising to reveal in a little while the secret of world peace. On several occasions it seemed as though the revelation was at hand; but for some reason at the last moment it was always delayed, time after time, year after year."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"272 Healing, the Divine Art For nearly seventy years the Captain waited faithfully for the solutional spirit message, but it never came. He did not marry; he gave up his business, and eked out a scanty living by doing odd jobs, for these could be dropped the moment he received the great call. In the course of his lifetime he consulted numerous mediums and psychics, but they could not wrest the secret from the mysterious spirit. At last, Captain Hartsell died at a Soldier’s Home, a broken-hearted old man, laid to rest in the army cemetery with those others who had fought at Get - tysburg. The promise of some world changing revelation from the spirits of the departed is a common and tragic form of psy - chic disturbance. At least a hundred such cases are known to me personally, and not one has ever received the knowledge promised. The original vision at Gettysburg could have been authentic, but even so, the spectral dead soldier had no real solution for the tragedy that had destroyed him. He never ap - peared but once; it was the Captain’s fixation that took over and manufactured a ghost out of the substances of longing, hope, and belief. This imaginary spirit could never bring the secret of peace, because it could never know more than the mind in which it was created. This is the true explanation of a large group of pseudo- psychical phenomena. If the supposed entity exists only in the mind of the believer, it can not under any conditions solve problems that the believer himself cannot solve. Such pseudo- spirit promises, therefore, either must go unfulfilled, or the an - swers come from the living person’s own level of thinking. Thus immature opinions may be transferred to the false ghost, to be returned again to their original creator through the lips of the vision, as an awe-filled and divine revelation. In this way many cults come to be founded by the self-deluded; and the spirit world is blamed for fantastic and foundation-less doctrines."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Ailments Psychical and Pseudo-Psychical 273 v o i c e s f R o m T h e g R e a T b e y o n d Persecution by voices, supposedly belonging to the dead, or to black magicians still alive, is a frequent form of pseudopsy - chic malady. From my large collection of such case histories, one is selected. It involves a prosaic man, a plumber by trade, who attempted to develop his spiritual perceptions with the aid of a crystal ball. William Jetty began to hear voices after his third sitting with the crystal. At the beginning he was appropriately thrilled with his newly gained clairaudience. But after a time, the spirits made quite a nuisance of themselves, with their constant jab - bering. The voices seemed to come from the air, and by differ - ences in their tones appeared to be both male and female; at least a dozen spirit personalities were differentiated. The plumber was in a sad state when he came to see me. Night or day he had no peace; always the atmosphere was alive with whispering, chuckling, moaning, or shouting entities. Some of the voices were vile and hateful, others were gentle and entreating. Recently the voices had urged the frightened man to commit suicide, and then they would howl with ghoulish glee and tell him that he was going mad. Even as he was telling me this story, Jetty could hear the demoniacal laughter of the spirits. It required considerable time and thought to clear up the case of William Jetty, the plumber. The spirits that had risen to torment him were born in the ghostly sphere of his own subconscious, in a ghastly procession of impulses, phobias, and complexes which had assumed audi - tory forms, to release their doleful energies through the sym - bolism of words. Jetty heard the voices in his own mind; and it was in vocal patterns that all of his old hates, fears, greed, lusts, grudges, and disappointments whispered their confused stories in his mental ear.

It was a great help to William Jetty to learn that his trou - ble was not due to evil spirits. As he expressed it, “I can fight against my own faults, but I cannot fight the supernatural.” With him, the battle was half won when the true state of af - fairs was known. It was the unknown that assumed monstrous proportions and paralyzed initiative. It made possible closing again the door of the subconscious, and returning the ghosts in time to their proper closet. Jetty went to work himself on some of the major fixations and cleared them up after a while. William Jetty gave up the crystal ball. He knows now that sitting for hours gazing into a gleaming sphere with the mind a blank is far, more likely to release the phantoms of the subcon - scious than it is to raise genuine spirits from the misty deep. T h e c a s e o f T h e m o v i n g f i n g e R s The lady was about forty years of age who one day dropped heavily into one of my office chairs. She was poorly organized, mentally, emotionally and physically; her suffering came from a serious overdose of a popular cultism. There were a number of interesting points in her narrative. Mrs. Ethel Kirkbride, as we’ll call her, married about fifteen years, was the mother of three children. From obvious defects in character it was easily understood that she was a poor house - keeper, mentally lazy, full of self pity, addicted to countless worries, extravagant and a nagger. A few months back Mrs. Kirkbride had noticed a peculiar twitching in her right arm and hand. This increased until she developed into a full-fledged automatic writer. Now, all she had to do was to pick up a pencil, and her fingers began to quiver and jerk as though moved by some spirit force, and the result was scrawling, half legible material, “signed by an archangel.”"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Ailments Psychical and Pseudo-Psychical 275 The purpose of the lady’s visit was not to secure help for her condition, but to invite me to publish her spirit manuscript, and thus change the whole course of human history. Examination proved the so-called book to be a hopeless and horrible mass of unrelated jargon, of no possible value to any - one. It had everything in it from soul-flights to bad poetry, the whole permeated with bitterness and frustration. The manu - script was heightened with a number of curious examples of neurotic and erotic symbolism. Broken down by the Freudian technique, usually applied to dreams, the automatic writings held the clearest indications that Mrs. Kirkbride was unhappily married, and that she enter - tained some very disagreeable notions about her husband. When told that her automatic literary production was a complete expose of her own private life, Ethel Kirkbride was properly indignant. As it was proven to her, incident by inci - dent, she glowered and fumed. At last, when she could stand no more of the damning evidence, she grabbed the manuscript, tore it to shreds and departed with a number of unladylike re - marks. But out of the scene came good results; Mrs. Kirkbride did no more automatic writing. But it is doubtful that her home has been much the happier. It has been proven to me on a number of occasions that au - tomatic writing can originate in the subconscious mind. It may come as wish fulfillment, or as a means of releasing frustrations and inhibitions. The same is true of the Ouija board and other psychic devices. d e l u s i o n s o f R e b i R T h The doctrine of reincarnation is one of the noblest and most practical of all philosophical teachings.

Occidental misunderstanding of the great law of rebirth as given by Gautama Buddha led to many humorous and pa - thetic situations at the time of the modern mystics giving the matter the benefit of their attention. A smallish gentleman, marked from head to foot with evi - dences of non-eventuality, slipped into my sanctum one day and drawing himself up to his full five-foot-four, announced solemnly, “I am here.” Evidently my reaction was not sufficiently profound; so he added, with gestures, “I am Ramses the Great, reborn to lead the world.” This visitor was not insane; it was not his mind that was lost, but his common sense. An amusing episode occurred at a meeting of an occult or - ganization when a leader declared that she was the reincarna - tion of Hypatia. Instantly another prominent member arose and shouted, “It’s not true—I’m Hypatia!” A man tall and thin with a smile enhanced by the lack of three front teeth, once buttonholed me after a lecture. “It’s a secret,” he whispered, “but I am Jacob Boehme reborn.” It seemed to me an excellent opportunity to get some valuable information about the strange teachings of this obscure Ger - man mystic. But, the toothless one could not answer any of my questions. He explained the complete loss of his previous knowledge by saying, “I am here for a greater purpose, and all my previous studies have been blocked from my conscious - ne ss,” Things get more complicated when the memory of other lives is so complete that the visitor remembers your past incarna - tions, as well as his own.

Not a great deal of variety enters into reincarnation stories; the elements are generally similar, with minor variations. Occa - sionally past lives are held responsible for phobias and aversions. One man attributed his pyrophobia, (fear of fire), to the belief that he had been burned at the stake in a previous existence. A lady of uncertain morals excused her nymphomania on the grounds that she was the re-embodiment of Sappho, without any trace of lyric poetry. Two case histories will indicate the usual trend of the rein - carnation persuasion. The first account is undoubtedly false, and the second probably true. Both persons were convinced that they had lived in Rome during the early centuries of the Christian Era. Robert Forsland felt certain that he was the rebirth of Mar - cus Aurelius Antoninus, Emperor and eclectic philosopher. While in college Robert had developed a bad case of hero wor - ship of this noble Roman, and had selected the Meditations as the subject for his thesis. After a number of years of normal business experience, soliciting insurance, Forsland read a book on reincarnation, and began to speculate as to his own previous lives. Quickly his mind reverted to Marcus Aurelius. Could it be possible that the haughty Marcus lived again in the humble frame of an insurance broker? If it was possible, it could be probable. If it was probable, it could be so. Ergo , it was so."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"278 Healing, the Divine Art Upon this extraordinary example of logic, Robert erected a sober conviction that the grandeur which was Rome abode in him. For a man of mediocre attainments, an imperial destiny was a heavy responsibility. Robert did his best; but that best was pitifully inadequate. Trying to be a superman, he failed utterly at the task of being a normal human. He lost the respect of his friends, and his insurance employers decided against ad - vancing a man with such a fixation to a position of authority. Had Robert borne the slightest intellectual resemblance to the splendid Antoninus, all could have been forgiven; but from any point of perspective, except his own, the claim was absurd; and could be interpreted only as a mental aberration. Albert Moorhead was an entirely different type of man, and his story demanded serious consideration. When Albert was six years old, he told his parents that he had lived before he was born to them. And in this previous life he had been a Roman soldier stationed in Palestine during the reign of the Emperor Vespasian. The Moorheads, a good, orthodox Scotch-Irish family, were horrified; the members all tried in every way to disprove this strange remembrance. But the boy refused to be shaken, and added so many accurate details of Roman life and history that in the end the parents themselves were half convinced. The little lad told them that in his former life his name was Lucian, and after serving several years in the Near East he had returned to Rome by way of Ephesus. Because of his service in foreign wars he became a member of the Imperial Guard, and frequently accompanied the Emperor on state missions. Later, he was pensioned and retired to a small farm, where he died at an advanced age. At eleven, Albert insisted on studying Latin; and so quickly did he learn the language that at thirteen he could read Virgil in the original.

He seldom discussed his memories, but one evening he summed up his conclusions thus: “I was only a soldier eighteen centuries ago, living the life of my time. I hope that in this incarnation I can do something really worth while. But if I cannot accomplish everything now, I will do my best and look forward with certainty to other lives.

But she was a brilliant lady and a charming hostess, so her peculiarity was passed over as a pos - sible consequence of Hapsburg blood. Had the Duchess been a metaphysician, her eccentricity in the matter of the chairs would have been regarded as proof that she was a very advanced soul who had selected this lofty perch to protect her higher vibrations from earthly contamination. A prominent occultist of some years back was so worried over the possibility of being drained of his especially refined psychic effluvium that he would shake hands only while wear - ing black silk gloves. As none of the World Saviors, prophets, or religious leaders, ever found a protection necessary, it may safely be assumed that the silk gloves metaphysically belong in the same category as the Duchess’s two chairs.

It was my misfortune, some years ago, to attend a lecture where a prominent speaker held the attention of a considerable audience while he explained how the moon was going to ex - plode, and the fragments shower down upon the earth, killing all who did not join his movement.

An interesting case of this kind comes to mind. It involves a truth lecturer who enjoyed the reality of coffee, at the same time denying the reality of caffeine. The reasoning used was somewhat as follows: The next time you think that coffee is go - ing to keep you awake at night, stand in front of a mirror and drink a large cup of coffee.

Once the bodily condition is corrected, it is possible to accomplish much more with the psychical and psychological difficulties. d i e T f a d d i s T s Truth-seekers seem particularly susceptible to dietetic fads. It was not so long ago that health movements assumed the proportions of religions, and some outlandish doctrines were taught. If some of the health cults were quite sane and help - ful, others had nothing to offer but laxatives and bad advice. The laxatives may have served a useful purpose, but at best the advice was worthless, These diets, variously circumscribed and limited by religious beliefs, aggravated constitutional ailments and stimulated functional disorders. The vegetarians stuffed themselves with starch, and the raw food addicts got into trou - ble with parasites and Paris green. When the system rebelled against the notions of its owner the unpleasant symptoms were interpreted as assaults by black magicians, or they were low vibrations sent out by enemies or relatives. Confronted by what appears to be a metaphysical ailment, the first thing to do is to check the physical health of the suf - ferer.

Each person has a normal rate of respiration. This may be abnormalized by emotional excitement or physical disease; but when this rhythm is disturbed by the mind, and the natural flow of the breath is variously controlled by the will, the results are likely to be measured in terms of nervous derangement. Even more dangerous than the breathing exercise itself is the stress and tension set up in the effort to concentrate and meditate, when the temperament is unsuited to such pursuits. Trying desperately to achieve the different spiritualized states described in the textbooks, or explained by the Oriental teach - er, the student passes through cycles of hope and despair, which work a real hardship on the constitution.

As none of the promises could be fulfilled, there was no particular point in being conservative. My collection of case histories includes a number dealing with the havoc wrought by development exercises. In only one instance was the damage definitely due to over-stimulation of psychic centers. It was a case in which the student had been practicing Yoga for nearly twenty years, and had neglected to bring his physical and emotional natures into harmony with the Yogic disciplines. He did not realize that it is fatal to per - form advanced esoteric exercises, and at the same time nurse personal animosities and a bad temper. The Hindu teacher involved in this tragedy was a fine and learned man, utterly sincere. He simply did not understand Western people; and it never occurred to him that a student would attempt to develop his spiritual faculties without correcting his personal faults as he went along. The average metaphysically-minded person is preserved from serious consequences by his lack of patience and conti - nuity of purpose. He studies a system of development and if illumination does not come in a few weeks he drifts to some other teacher who promises quicker results. While this process is demoralizing in itself, it may prove less serious than the con - sequences of actually attempting a long program of effort in a wrong direction. Oriental exercises are not the only ones that can cause dif - ficulty. One disciple of a Western sect followed its instructions to the letter: He placed a lighted candle on each side of a mir - ror and gazed at his own eyes in the glass. The result was a form of auto-hypnosis; the poor man could not release his eyes from their reflections in the mirror, and finally collapsed in an hysterical convulsion.

When you point out to the leader the chaos that is developing in his cult, he assures you that it is impossible for the teaching to be at fault in any particular. The instructions are divinely inspired; and if anything is wrong, the members themselves are to blame. P R o s P e R i T y T e a c h i n g s Certain prosperity teachings must be mentioned, because of their final demoralizing effect upon the health. One lady told me that it was positively uncanny how she could get any - thing she wanted by visualizing her desire, then demanding that the universe bring about its fulfillment.

Her mental decrees had all been backed up by a series of dishonest and despicable plots, which she justified by a religious belief that everyone is divinely entitled to anything that they ardently desire. Less violent forms of the prosperity delusion include the process of sitting down and waiting for the universe to pro - vide. This is no more than a highly esoteric form of laziness. A man who had followed this formula described to me in thrill - ing detail the proof of divine providence in his life.

Such procedures as these cannot fail to have a detrimental result in the lives of human beings. Existence is a kind of bal - anced struggle for survival and accomplishment. Men become strong and wise through struggle and effort. When the incen - tives for living are confused by irrational beliefs, all parts of the personality suffer; for a man cannot be happy or healthy unless he is carrying his part of the common load. Nature punishes alike the drone and the schemer by making their misdeeds the basis of compensatory misfortunes. Criticizing or exposing religious frauds is resented by many persons who believe that we should see only the good in these beliefs, whether it be present or not.

When the ancient Israelites built their tabernacle in the wil - derness they divided the peoples of the twelve tribes into three classes of worshippers. The multitudes gathered in the great open square before the temple to pray, to make offerings, and to listen to the moral counsel of the priests. The priests themselves assembled in the inner courtyard, there to discourse on deeper matters and worship in another and more learned way. Only the High Priest could enter the Holy of Holies, where the Spirit of the Lord hovered between the wings of the Cherubim. The High Priest had a rope fastened to his foot when he approached the Mercy Seat. If one worldly or unhallowed thought entered his mind while in the presence of Jehovah, he would be stricken dead. As the other priests could not enter the Holy of Holies, they would be the ones to drag the body out of the sanctuary by the rope on its foot. In spite of foolish talk about new dispensations, under which all humanity may study the sacred sciences, the old laws still hold true, and will always remain in force. As the great Mai - monides so wisely pointed out, the moral parts of religions are suited to the majority of men; the philosophical parts are suited to the few who have given their lives to such studies; and the spiritual parts are reserved to the very few whom God himself shall select from the number of the learned. It is better for the multitude that its worship should be before the gate; and many cultists would be safer and happier in the old and simple faith of their fathers.

These malignant agencies were exorcised by the Church with the aid of rituals, holy water, and sacred relics. It was customary to make a small hole in the floor of a room where witches were examined or tortured. When the demon was forced from the body of its victim, it could take the form of a rat and escape through the prepared opening. If the hole was not provided, the spirit might attach itself to one of the inquisitors. In modern belief the possessing entity usually is recognized as human or elemental. It is widely taught in present day cults that possession by spirits frequently is mistaken for insanity, and so improperly treated by materialistic physicians; for they do not recognize the difference between obsession and true in - sanity. And it is quite possible that such mistakes actually do occur. Cases of alleged obsession have come under my observa - tion in considerable number, affording excellent opportunity to examine this strange phenomenon. Present in most instances has been the factor of divided personality. Nearly everyone is to some degree a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Among the mystic faiths there is much discussion of higher and lower natures, and the eternal conflict between them. As Goethe expressed it,"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Diagnosis and Treatment 291 “Two souls within our body strive.” Thus the Faust and sub- Faust struggle for dominion. The dominant personality comes to be recognized as the normal self, and the submerged per - sonality goes unrecognized, unless some unusual happening reverses the polarities. A personality can be split by the violent inhibition of a group of normal and natural impulses. An overdose of indoc - trination can cause the very outburst of potentials that it seeks to prevent. In noticeable evidence is the old belief that the minister’s son is sure to turn out badly. An early surfeit will turn the mind against all religious con - victions. Nothing good is accomplished by inhibiting normal mental, emotional, or physical tendencies; the auto-corrective mechanism in human nature will finally force the release of the inhibited impulses. If the inhibitions have been intensive over a long period of time, the releasing process may bring about disastrous results. A quiet and patient husband endured the cruel and bitter nagging of his wife for twenty-five years without once losing his temper. Then, one morning he killed her with an ax. Had this man expressed his proper indignation at times along the way of their married life, the wife would have been a better woman, and the husband would not have ended up as a murderer. He held his temper too long in the presence of just cause, and trag - edy was the outcome. A little girl, of a family exceedingly poor, spent many hours of each day gazing into shop windows at pretty trinkets she could not buy. Later, a fortunate marriage gave her the means to purchase whatever she wanted. But it was too late; years of inhibition had destroyed her ability to enjoy the very things she once had wanted. Then, suddenly, this Mrs. Winters, as we’ll call her, developed kleptomania. She began by stealing small articles, and was very happy with the little things that she stole, but found no pleasure in things bought for her. Mr. Winters"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"292 Healing, the Divine Art went about quietly and paid the merchants for the shoplifted articles without his wife’s knowledge. This woman was obsessed with two fixations; the love of pretty things; and the childhood realization that to buy them was an unforgivable extravagance, for to spend money foolishly was to deprive her family of food. So firmly was this fixed in her subconscious that in adult life the things she wanted brought her no happiness, unless she could secure them without spend - ing once crucial money. Another little girl, coming home from school one day was a victim of criminal exhibitionism. If little Florence had followed her first impulse, which was to run home and tell her parents, the chances are no serious damage would have been done. But when the child reached the house she was in hysterics, and afraid to describe what had occurred. In the privacy of her own room, Florence re-lived the terrible experience hundreds of times, and a serious psychological condition was established. Even then, this delicately poised fixation might have been neutralized by a fortunate romance or marriage. But in her late teens Flor - ence went through an unhappy love affair; and this changed the fixation into a complete obsession. Her entire personality passed through a rapid change and as the aversion mechanism came into complete power and assumed the proportions of an obsession, Florence developed pronounced lesbian tendencies. T h e c a s e o f T h e T w i n b R o T h e R s One morning my phone rang, and a masculine voice at the other end of the wire inquired, rather casually, “Can you do anything for a man who is someone else?” This was the case: Two brothers, twins, but not identical twins, had volunteered for military service in the First World War. Harry and George were intensely devoted to each other,"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Diagnosis and Treatment 293 and had never been separated until the time of their enlist - ment. Overseas, a few weeks before the armistice, Harry was killed in action. When the news reached George he collapsed, and was invalided home, presumably suffering from what was then broadly termed shell-shock. It was while recuperating that George made the astonishing discovery that he was no longer himself but his brother, Harry. He had kept this strange secret for a number of years, but gradually a deep concern had arisen in his mind. If Harry had taken his body, what had happened to his own consciousness? Was he, George, wandering about in the spirit world while he, Harry, was living on selfishly, in the body of another? He, as Harry, was perfectly willing to die, if George could come back. But could he, George, return and use the body that had been taken from him? As is usual in these cases, the causes of the trouble re - vealed themselves. In the telephone message was the first clue. When George inquired, “Can you do anything for a man who is someone else?” It was George asking about Harry. Through - out the narrative it was George who knew that he was Harry. It was George, as Harry, who was willing to die for Harry, as George. If Harry had taken his brother’s body, he would not have said, “after Harry died in France,” but rather, “After I died in France.” This was a case of obsession by an idea, and not possession by a spirit. The twin brothers had been very close, and a vivid picture of each was in the subconscious mind of the other. Grief imposed the mental image of Harry upon the personality of George, and he really thought he was his brother. The psychic personality of Harry was built up from memories, supplemented by George’s own conclusions about his brother’s temperament. Suggestion therapy soon cleared up the confusion. Mrs. Yeaman developed a curious delusion. She was con - vinced that her only child, a daughter who had died in her"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"294 Healing, the Divine Art ninth year, came back on various occasions from the spirit world and manifested through the body of her mother, possessing it for several hours at a time. During these periods Mrs. Yeaman seemed to become a small child; even her voice changed, and she prattled on about dolls and toys and Teddy bears. Many spiritualists believe that children who die continue to mature in the spirit world, but little Constance never grew up, because her mother was unable to visualize the child beyond her ninth year. This was another case of idea obsession. James Avitt claimed that his body was borrowed without his consent by an Oriental mystic who preferred to manifest his presence without taking on a corporeal constitution. While possessed by the spirit of this Hindu, James made learned dis - courses on Asiatic metaphysics. He insisted that he could not have made the speeches himself. But, when questioned, he ad - mitted that he had attended many lectures by Yogis and Swa - mis. The subject matter of these lectures had not been retained in his conscious mind, but all were properly recorded in his subconscious, later to come out through this apparent obses - sion. In many alleged cases of spirit possession, the possessing entity is of a lower mental and moral order than the supposed victim. The reason for this is that it is customary to inhibit the less desirable phases of character, and these build up in the suppressed personality. When an obsession results in the com - plete degeneration of the moral nature it is safe to assume that the obsession is a symptom of strongly inhibited tendencies to deprav it y. In the course of years a few cases of genuine occult obses - sion have presented themselves. One experience with these rare instances is worth noting. My library contains a number of early magical manuscripts, including some which deal with the rites for the exorcising of evil spirits and obsessing demons. It occurred to me to try"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Diagnosis and Treatment 295 these medieval formulas on Otto Fertig, who was having seri - ous trouble with some kind of an entity. Strangely enough, the spells were effective almost immediately; the bothersome spirit, whoever he was, departed in haste; and did not return. If there is a reasonable suspicion that an account of spirit possession is genuine, the simple remedy is to change the psy - chic pattern of the afflicted person. If the life is shifted into a new design the obsessing being is likely to depart. Improved physical health, new interests in living, and a positive normal outlook, result in the body becoming an uncomfortable habita - tion for the uninvited guest. Obsessions, both psychological and occult, usually occur in very neurotic persons, and the breaking of the neurosis ends this type of phenomena. b a s i c P R i n c i P l e s o f T R e a T m e n T It is always easier to prevent a psychic disturbance than to get rid of one after it is thoroughly established. False teach - ings and improper methods of study are the principal causes of metaphysical health problems, which makes it evident that it is in these directions the ounce of prevention must be applied. Those who are likely to be unduly influenced by spiritual pretensions can always be reminded that a metaphysical teacher is not a superhuman being, in spite of his claims. He may, or may not, be learned in his subject, but his solemn pronounce - ments are no more important than the opinions of other men, unless he can substantiate his claims by reasonable and under - standable proof. By keeping this thought in mind the truth- seeker can avoid wrong selection of subject matter. Improper methods of study are a common fault. This is be - cause the average person does not know how to discipline his thoughts. One frequent mistake is to plunge into a religious doctrine to the exclusion of every other consideration in life. The enthusiast will read day and night, taking off only enough"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"296 Healing, the Divine Art time to attend the meetings of his chosen cult. He lives solely for his new found convictions, and wears himself out in a few weeks. The mind, unused to such specialized exertions, be - comes exhausted and confused, and the integrity of the view - point is lost. Life takes on an appearance of undeviating seriousness to the tyro in the mystic arts. Those who are obsessed with the problem of their eternal salvation have no time for rest or re - laxation. The ‘advanced’ students are those who are ever ready to tell me that simple, homely, human things no longer interest them; they have evolved beyond the commonplace, for their lives are wholly dedicated to truth. This whole attitude is wrong. No sound educational institu - tion would permit students to ponder any subject continuously for months, and certainly not for years, without break or relax - ation. Contrast is necessary to the normal function of the intel - lect, and where it is lacking the thinking will not be found. Religious beliefs are just as habit-forming as narcotics; and the damage done in both cases is equally serious. The religious addict degenerates into a fanatic, and all progress is lost. One hour a day of abstract metaphysical study is all that can safely be sustained by the average mentality. Additional hours hinder rather than help. When the appointed period of study is ended, the wise stu - dent closes the book, detaches his mind from the entire field of metaphysical thought and interests himself in other mat - ters that concern ordinary human beings. No student is so advanced that he can not profitably laugh and play, or keep up his social contacts, continue his recreations, and attend to his regular duties. For science, and art, and literature, and so - ciology are just as important to a well-rounded philosophical viewpoint as mystical religion. Occult diseases are not likely to afflict well-balanced mentalities, but they are always a threat to one-track minds."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Diagnosis and Treatment 297 Those who go off the deep end in their religious contempla - tions often find themselves in domestic difficulties. They bur - den the entire family with their immature opinions, neglect their children, allow their homes to go to wrack and ruin, and fail utterly in their responsibilities as husbands or wives. To those of practical mind, such spiritual beliefs are not particu - larly attractive; and so the fanatic is likely to regard himself as misunderstood and even persecuted by his relatives, when the fault is actually his own. A splendid way to keep the feet on the ground is to balance occult studies with their correspondences among the physical sciences or philosophies. Those who are interested in alchemy, can take a course in chemistry. If astrology is all, the study of astronomy is the anodyne. Those interested in the mystical as - pects of comparative religion, might well enroll for a university course in the subject. The foolish belief to be eliminated is, that time is wasted in un-illuminated formal education. Throughout the country opportunities exist for men and women whose educational advantages have been limited to study extension courses or attend adult sessions of the eve - ning schools. The public libraries can supply properly balanced programs of home reading on most vital themes. By availing himself of these facilities the sincere truth-seeker can educate himself in the great systems of human thought that have led the world. Suppose someone is interested in Buddhism. Several of the larger universities have courses in Oriental religions. These em - brace the conditions that brought Buddhism into existence, the sphere of its influence, the best available information about the historical Buddha, the faith that he founded, the councils by which its course was changed, and the means by which the doctrines were disseminated throughout Asia. When armed with a solid working knowledge of the Buddhist philosophy,"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"298 Healing, the Divine Art misinformation can be detected immediately, and the admired teachings can also be defended with authority. This was the burden of my recommendations to Mrs. El - sie Redlich when she came to me for help to straighten out a muddle of neo-Buddhist nonsense she had gathered from several poorly informed but very imaginative teachers. Mrs. Redlich was aghast at the prospect of actually studying Bud - dhism under academic supervision. “I could never study every day,” she exclaimed; “I don’t know how to study; and I could never remember all those awful names and dates and places. And to write out answers to questions: why I simply haven’t got that kind of mind. I don’t want a lot of dry facts; I want Illumination.” This good lady was trying to study the deepest and most complicated philosophical system in the world; and yet she admitted to having the kind of mind that couldn’t at school learn the simple historical facts of the Buddhist religion. She of course had no desire to improve her mind; all she wanted was to achieve nirvana without effort. And this is so with many metaphysicians; they do not want to work for knowledge. They are content to listen to their favorite teacher and let him do the thinking for them. They desire the rewards of wisdom without the long and difficult process of becoming wise. s T R i c T b u T s y m P a T h e T i c g u i d a n c e If it is too late to establish proper thinking habits, then it is necessary to repair, insofar as possible, the damage done by wrong habits. When a person in psychic difficulty comes for help, strict but sympathetic guidance is needed. It must be un - derstood with the patient that he will follow to the letter the method of treatment outlined by the healer. If he refuses to agree to such a program, then he should be dismissed imme - diately. I have found it wise also to decline the case when it is"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Diagnosis and Treatment 299 evident that the sufferer has mental reservations and is likely to disobey in spite of promises. Successes are few with those patients who feel that they know more than the practitioner. If the psychic disturbance is the result of false or improper instruction, the sufferer must be made to sever all relations with the organization or teacher responsible for the trouble. Only on this condition should the case be handled. If the teachings themselves are reputable, and the difficulty is due to misun - derstanding or misapplication of principles, the mistakes must be corrected, and then the mind be given a period for rest and readjustment. If extreme nervousness or hallucinations are present, all metaphysical studies and development exercises of every kind must be discontinued for at least a year after the last of the unpleasant symptoms have disappeared. Once the nervous sys - tem has been upset, it remains supersensitive for some time to the causes which produced the specialized tension. In other re - spects the nerves may be quite normal, but if confronted again with a similar type of stress, the nervous structure will show damage almost immediately. Some devotees will not stop their exercises, because they fear that to do so will retard the development of their spiritual natures. Such a one said to me, “I would rather die than give up my occult growth.” She made her choice; she died less than a year later in a home for mental cases. T h e P h y s i c a l e x a m i n a T i o n The procedure with a patient includes a complete physical examination, with special attention to chronic ailments, the nervous system, the ductless glands, the eyes and the teeth. Mystical speculations seem to work an especial hardship on the glandular functions; and conversely, if the glands are deranged"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"300 Healing, the Divine Art the mental and emotional natures are particularly susceptible to psychic disturbances. As many metaphysicians neglect their physical health, either from addiction to mental healing meth - ods, or because of their prejudices against doctors, the physi - cal examination usually reveals a number of conditions that require correction. Then, to proceed in proper order, the diet should be consid - ered; and there is a wide variety of fads in this field. Religious movements that impose particular diets on their members sel - dom inquire into the nutritional requirements of the individual cases. One group which had followers in Northern Siberia ac - tually demanded of these poor folks that they give up meat eating and the wearing of furs—a death sentence in that barren and frigid country. Sufferers from nervous and psychic ailments should be en - couraged to eat normally and wisely of nourishing and prop - erly prepared foods. Three well-balanced meals, eaten regularly, and taken with enjoyment, will go a long way toward clearing up psychic difficulties. Mysterious symptoms can result from nervous stomach trouble aggravated by the belief that one gains spiritual merit by attempting to wean the body from ‘low vibra - tion’ foodstuffs. In my experience occasional but considerable trouble can be caused by over use of citrus fruits. They should be taken very moderately by persons suffering from any nerve excitement or irritation. Some flourish on one type of diet, and some on another; there is no way of planning a food program that will fit all cases. Usually a simple, tasteful meal of regular foods, eaten in moderate amounts, brings the best results. It is certainly a mistake to become so conscious of things to eat that no time or energy is left to perfect the life in other ways."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Diagnosis and Treatment 301 e m o T i o n a l f R u s T R a T i o n s As emotional frustrations lead a large number of unhap - py persons to the study of religion, these frustrations are next on the list to be investigated. Usually, religion does not solve emotional problems I it merely transforms the impulses and obscures their natural origin. Inhibited emotions, unrequited loves, unhappy marriages, disastrous romances, tragic sexual experiences, and general disillusionment may be suspected whenever a person turns to religion with fanatical devotion. As women brood over these matters much more than men, women members are likely to predominate in religious organizations. Persons who nurture grievances and griefs are inclined to choose a solitary life. They have few friends, and their melan - choly dispositions are not calculated to draw acquaintances, or to hold them. And so, it is always helpful in diagnosing and treating to examine into the social life of the patient. If mysti - cism is being used simply to fill up the days of a lonely exis - tence, the sufferer should be encouraged to increase his circle of friends and take a more active part in the life of his community and neighborhood. The extroversion which results from par - ticipating in social activities is a fine and normal way of break - ing down inhibitions. The tendency to go off by one’s self and suffer in silence, is bad, not only for the victim himself, but it is against all the laws of social existence. The present temper of our time complicates this situation. It is not easy to find congenial people, and most groups of the socially minded are inclined toward extravagance and dissipa - tion. But outside contacts are necessary; and a little thought will discover a suitable avenue of social expression. Hobbies are important to the balanced life of the individu - al. All metaphysicians should have hobbies entirely apart from their spiritual beliefs. Hobbies broaden the perspective, increase the store of useful knowledge, stimulate outside contacts, and"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"302 Healing, the Divine Art break down internal tension. When neurotic inclinations are pronounced, the sufferer will find that a hobby can give con - structive release and comfort. An avocation has possible eco - nomic advantages, also; it may lead to a future vocation. But regardless of this contingency, it is valuable in complementing the dominant interests of the personality. A number of cases have come to me in which the spiritual studies were used to escape from some real and personal prob - lems of the moment. Both the French and Russian revolutions were caused, in part, by this approach to vital issues. The aris - tocracy exploited the people and the clergy recommended only patience under affliction. In the end the people rose and de - stroyed both church and state. Let me give you an example of this condition as it exists in the lives of modern truth-seekers. Mrs. Lucille Stewart told her story in these words: “If it was not for my studies of truth, I could not live with my husband another day. He is selfish, insensitive, and completely immersed in his own affairs. We have nothing in common, but it is my karma , so I will stay with him and be patient until the law of life gives me release.” Her attitude was noble and kind but ut - terly impractical and unsound. In the first place, she was con - tributing to the delinquency of her husband by permitting him to continue in his selfish ways without correction or discom - fort. And in the second place, she was injuring her own psy - chological structure by going along, year after year, deprived of the natural companionship and close sympathy to which she was entitled. No good was coming out of the problem for either person, except the wife’s over-development of patience to the degree of frustration. Mrs. Stewart had been driven to religion by this very frus - tration, and through the lack of courage to put her house in order. She should have corrected her domestic difficulties by a simple application of common sense. When she came to me, Mrs. Stewart was suffering from hallucinations and a variety"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Diagnosis and Treatment 303 of nervous ailments. There was no possibility of a permanent correction until she solved the disaster in her emotional life. Instead of inspiring her to solve this problem, religion was giv - ing her only patience to endure something she had no need to endure. Attempting to practice the metaphysical disciplines of sev - eral different cults at the same time often leads to trouble. This is not broad-mindedness, but a dangerous eclecticism. It is al - ways wise to secure a list of the patient’s affiliations from the time he became interested in mysticism. Many clues will be un - earthed in this way. Sometimes the fault lies not with the pres - ent teachings, but with old notions which have lingered in the recesses of the mind. It is also useful to check the individual’s present reading. He may have picked up dangerous literature, which abounds at the moment. T h e h o P e l e s s , T h e c o o P e R a T i v e , T h e m i s T a k e n The character and disposition of the patient must be care - fully considered when recommending a system of treatment. The spiritually sick divide themselves into three distinct classes according to mentality and temperament. The first division is made up of the cases that are nearly, if not entirely, hopeless. This does not mean that the ailment is hopeless, but rather, that the addiction to foolish beliefs is incurable. If such persons are helped out of one difficulty, they will fall immediately into another. There is no good, solid ra - tiocination possible to these folks; they are vague, disconnected in their thinking, filled with platitudes and noble generalities, and utterly unable to resist the persuasive powers of fraudulent teachers and cults. The second division encompasses those who still retain con - siderable of their native intelligence and will cooperate within"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"304 Healing, the Divine Art certain limitations. There is a good chance of getting these per - sons back to normalcy, and they are proof against the more obvious types of religious swindles. This group will follow in - structions that are given, but most of their decisions must be made for them, as they have little innate talent for spiritual speculations. The third, and smallest division, contains men and wom - en of marked ability and unquestioned intelligence who have made a few mistakes, but have the mental power to solve their problems once they understand the causes. These types will do their part cheerfully and enthusiastically, and can be set right in nearly every instance. Only wide experience can bestow skill in the diagnosis and treating of metaphysical diseases. While all the cases are much alike in principle, the personality equation complicates each problem, for almost certainly the patient is working against his own best interests. Long familiarity with the subject, however, enables the practitioner to estimate the situation correctly, even before the sufferer has begun to tell his story. R e s T o R a T i o n T o n o R m a l c y If all the circumstances listed in this section have been checked upon and analyzed, the healer is in possession of most of the information necessary to form the basis of treatment. Lesser details will fall into their proper places, and the case can be considered as a whole-a complete problem pattern. It is not possible in a general work of this kind to explain the formulas used in treating every combination of mystical maladjustment. Here again, experience is the only certain guide; experience de - rived from a thorough knowledge of the occult philosophies, and perfected through years of practical application. The broad, basic rule of treatment is that normalcy must be restored. That which is abnormal to any individual is dangerous"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Diagnosis and Treatment 305 to his life and health. This is true even though the abnormality results from a sincere effort to live some religious belief that is beyond the understanding or capacity of the believer. There is no truth in the notion that God will protect the foolish because they are sincere in their foolishness. It is entirely possible to get into serious trouble searching for truth, if the seeker breaks natural laws along the way. Deity protects only those who are too wise to attempt to break Its laws. Happy, simple, human ways are the best ways for the ordi - nary man. There are a few whose extraordinary abilities qualify them to explore the mysteries of magic and the occult sciences, but it is extremely unfortunate for the average person to at - tempt the works of genius. If the passion for the mystic arts is strong and irresistible, then the proper foundation must be laid in study and research under reputable instruction. It is evident that a man who cannot distinguish a false teacher from a true one is not yet ready to search after the great spiritual intangibles of the universe. It may seem that this book attacks all mystical philoso - phies; but such is not the intention. It is a volume devoted to metaphysical healing, with therefore little space to be devoted to the spiritually healthy. But they exist, and in considerable numbers, among those who have found in their beliefs strength and courage to face the problems of life and perfect their own characters. They have approached the subject quietly and in - telligently, have never been involved in dubious organizations, have never followed after questionable teachers, and have never tried to finish the work of ages in a few short years. And so they are not seeking help for their troubles; they have kept out of trouble by the generous use of common sense. Once, twenty-five centuries ago, the Greek sage, Thales of Miletus, was walking down a narrow road at night discours - ing to his disciples about the stars.

Man is a spiritual being with feet of clay. In his haste to release his divine potentials he may well forget that he is bound to the earth by a corporeal nature that has certain reasonable demands that must be satisfied. 2"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Visit Our Online Catalog at www.prs.or g Works on Occult Philosophy by Manly P.
