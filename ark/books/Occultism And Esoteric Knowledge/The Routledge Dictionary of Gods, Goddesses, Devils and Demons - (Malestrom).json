Gods and demons are the forms taken by these powers, their hypostatizations, as it were, in the shape of light and darkness, sun and moon, fire and water, bird and snake. The divine can reveal itself in all the phenomena of nature, just as the demonic can. But it is not only from with- out that the numinous presents itself to man: it can arise spontaneously in religious experience as an ‘exponent of feeling’ (Wilamowitz-Moellendorf ), and it can be divined as ‘a dark abyss . . . which is not accessible to our reason’ (Rudolf Otto) . The images generated in the human mind are, then, representative of stages reached in man’s understanding and in his knowledge of himself; in a certain sense, indeed, every divine image has traits which identify it as a self-projection of mankind. As ideal beings, the gods are what man would like to be; but they are also what he, in his spatio- temporal imperfection, cannot be. Every religion has its own conventions and symbols which serve to express the functions, the aspects and the spheres of competence of the members of its pantheon. And this means that the conscious and unconscious nexus of conventions specific to any one religion is hardly, if at all, accessible to believers in another religion, or to those who believe in no religion at all. Thus, even for the ancient Greeks the animal gods of the Egyptians were shocking and revolting. And modern man, proud as he is of his reason and logic, fares no better when he is called upon to recognize an authentic view of God in the often and – in the most literal sense – obscure rites and images of an alien religion. Above all, we must not fail to recognize that the concepts ‘god’ and ‘demon’ are by no means evenly weighted in the various religions. The innumerable deities of Hinduism and Buddhism carry about as much significance as angels or saints do in monotheistic religions. There are mortal gods, gods who die (like Balder and Osiris) and demonic beings whom death cannot touch (for example, the Devas). The border- line between gods and demons is fluid (see Asura, or the Nymphs); and with the Christianization of a people, its erstwhile deities can be devalued to the status of devils (as in the case of Pan or Dabog) or accepted into the corpus of Christian saints (for example, Brigit Köndös). From the largely anonymous mass of spirits, gods and demons are distinguished by being more sharply and individually characterized, as shown, for example in the bestowal of names upon them. The present reference work offers a conspectus of all the more important supernat- ural beings who have acquired ‘personality’ in this sense, both in the pantheons of the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"classical cultures and in the world religions of today; and the religious systems of the so-called ‘primitive’ races are also given their due place. Any attempt at an exhaustive survey of all the names, functions, symbols and attributes in this field was excluded from the outset: the mass of material is such that even several volumes could hardly cope with it. Heroic figures in saga and legend have been included only where this is justified by their subsequent deification: thus, Aeneas and Heraklés are included, while the Celtic King Arthur and the Germanic hero Siegfried are not. The same goes for founders of religions, and for saints: the reader will find Buddha and Lao-zi in these pages, but neither Muhammad nor Zarathustra. Mythological detail has been intention- ally cut to a minimum. There is no entry for Christ: for various reasons, adequate treat- ment of this figure lies outside the scope of the present work. The reader’s attention is directed particularly to the two appendices, in which the individual gods and demons are classified from various points of view. The illustrations serve only to lighten the text, and are not intended to be in any way a scientifically exact iconography. It should be borne in mind that in the case of certain cultures it is hardly possible to find suitable matter for illustrative purposes and that certain peoples and religions have a pronounced antipathy to images and representation of any sort.

Head-words in the origi- nal text carry stress-marks based on: H. Hunger, Lexikon der griechischen und römischen Mythologie , 6th edn, 1969. These are retained. 2 Sanskrit and Vedic Standard transcription is used for Sanskrit and Vedic names, based on Macdonell, Sanskrit-English Dictionary , OUP, 1924. The distinction between the dental series: t, d, n, s; the retroflex series: t , d , j , s ; and the palatal series: c, j, ñ, f , has been retained. Here, s and f are both pronounced as sh ; t , d , j are the same sounds as are heard in English t, d, n; t, d, n are their continental counterparts (as in Italian); ñ is the Spanish ñ. 3 The sh sound where it otherwise occurs – particularly in ancient Near Eastern and Egyptian names – is transcribed as ˇ s.

Under the name Etsai (i.e. devil) it instructs its devotees in its arts. Abaddon (Hebrew, ‘downfall’, ‘ruin’) In the Old Testament, the word refers to the underworld, the place of destruc- tion (e.g. Job 26: 2; 28: 22). In the Apocalypse, it means the angel of hell, the lord of the plague of locusts (Revelation 9: 7–11). Known in Greek as Apollyon, i.e. destroyer. Abat(t)ur A mythical figure of the Mandaeans. At the last judgment it weighs souls and/or their deeds. The name derives from Persian and is construed as meaning ‘bearer of the scales’. Abellio A Gallic local deity, known from inscriptions in the Garonne valley. He has been interpreted as a god of apple- trees. Abgal (Apkallu) Seven Sumerian spir- its deriving from the Abzu ( → Apsu) and subject to Enki. It is probable that they reflect legendary antediluvian kings .Some of the Abgal are conceived as fish-men. Abhiyoga Generic name of the servile gods in Jainism; they help the supreme gods ( → Indra) to create rain and darkness. Abora The supreme being worshipped by the Canary Islanders on the island of Palma. The god sat in heaven and caused the stars to move. Abraxas A (variants Abrasax, Abraxis) Occult theonym used in Graeco-Oriental gnosti- cism. In Greek values, the letters add up to 365, corresponding thus to the number of days in the year. The hebdomad of let- ters was associated with the seven plan- ets. Abraxas stones were used as amulets and usually show the god with the torso and the arms of a man, the head of a cock and serpent legs. In scientific liter- ature he is also known as Angnipede \u0001 ‘snake-feet’. Abu Sumerian god of vegetation. According to one tradition he was born from the skull of → Enki, an image of the emergence of plants from the earth’s surface. Abundantia Roman goddess personi- fying abundance ( abundantia ). She lived on in the Lady Habonde (Abundia) of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"French popular belief, who visits people’s houses by night bringing prosperity. Acala ‘The Immovable’, a divinity in Indian Buddhism. As ‘Protector of the Teaching’ his image stands before tem- ples to ward off those hostile to the Buddhist doctrine. He has three eyes and six arms, and he grinds his teeth. His weapons include the sword, the thunder- bolt (Vajra), the axe and the noose. Acaviser → Lasas Achelóos Greek river-god bearing the same name as the river which runs into the Ionian Sea. The son of → Okeanos and of → Tethys. The myth tells how Achelóos fought the hero Heraklés for possession of the Deinaeira, taking the form first of a snake, then of a bull. He married the muse Melpomene, and the → Sirens were supposed to be his daughters. Under the name Achlae, Achelóos is attested in Etruria from the sixth century BC onwards, and is represented as heav- ily bearded and with the horns of a bull. Achilleus (Latin, Achilles) Hero of Greek legend. The young Achilleus had been dipped by his mother → Thetis in the water of the Styx to make him invul- nerable, but the water did not touch the heel by which she held him (hence ‘Achilles’ heel’). In the Trojan War he was slain by Paris. Achilleus was venerated as a hero throughout Greece. In the Black Sea area he had divine status, and was known from the Hadrian era onwards by the epithet Pontarchos \u0001 ruler of the sea. Acoran The supreme being, wor- shipped by the inhabitants of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. Temples to him were erected in remote mountain places difficult of access, and these affor- ded inviolable asylum. A daily offering of milk was made to the god by maidens clad in white leather. Adad 2 Acala (in Syria, Hadad) Babylonian god of weather and rain; the name is usually written with the cuneiform character for ‘wind’. He was thought of as son of the supreme god → An. His epithets ‘Dyke-warden of Heaven’ and ‘Lord of Abundance’ identify him as the beneficent giver. If he withholds the rains, drought and famine ensue. His symbolical animal was the bull, his sign was a cluster of lightning flashes. An ancient hymn describes how heaven and earth rise before the god, who is also called Ramman ( \u0001 thunder). The illustration (a seal motif ) shows him in a robe adorned with astral signs and with a tall hat deco- rated on top with feathers; in his hand he holds the pincer-shaped bolts of lightning. Adam(m)as The parental godhead of the Naassenes, a gnostic movement in Phrygia; conceived as a father-mother syzygy, the ‘parents of the aeons’. Adam Kadmon According to the Kabbala (a Jewish mystical movement) the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"first man, an emanation of absolute perfec- tion. He is symbolized by the major axis of ten concentric circles, the Sephiroth or ten circles of creation. Thus, Adam Kadmon as primeval man symbolizes the universe. He is androgynous, and is seen in ancient Jewish mysticism as partaking in, or blend- ing with God. The Bahir book (twelfth century) mentions the ‘seven holy forms of God’, all of which have correspon- dences in the limbs of the human body. Man thus exhibits the mystic structure of the godhead. Adam Kasia (‘the hidden Adam’), also known as Adam Qadmaia, ‘the first Adam’ .A god-like form postulated by the Mandaeans, which unites in itself microcosm and macrocosm. This form was regarded as, at one and the same time, the soul of the corporeal Adam and as the soul of every man. Adam Kasia is a redeemer, and is himself redeemed. Cf. in Jewish mysticism, → Adam Kadmon. Adibuddha (‘primeval Buddha’) The concept is of a → Buddha who has existed from the beginning of time and who has created, through contempla- tive development of his Self, the five → Dhy a ni-Buddhas. These are the Buddhas of contemplation, which then bring forth the five → Dhy a ni-Bodhisattvas, from which the universe arises in a series of self-superseding acts of creation. Adibuddha is thus a kind of primeval or original creator. His epithet is Vajradhara (‘bearer of the thunderbolt’). Aditi Indian goddess; her dominion is over the divine ordering of the world, and she is the mother of the → A dityas. In later tradition she appears as the personi- fication of the earth; her bosom is its navel. The name ‘Aditi’ really means ‘infinity’, and the goddess is a form of the Great Mother who embraces all living and being. She is also a redeemer figure, as she is supposed to free those who believe in her from sickness, need and the stains of sin. A dityas ‘Progeny of Aditi’ ( → Aditi) A Vedic grouping of seven or eight gods; at its head is → Va r u j a, often in associ- ation with → Mitra and → Aryaman. Martanda, the eighth son of Aditi, is seen as the divine fore-father of the human race. Like Aditi, the A dityas were believed to offer salvation from all ills. Post-Vedic literature postulates twelve A dityas in the role of twelve sun-gods, who are in turn connected with the twelve months of the year. Adonis Originally a Phoenician-Syrian god (the Semitic word ‘adon’ means ‘mas- ter’). He embodies vegetation scorched by the heat of the summer sunshine, and was worshipped in the mystic cults as a god who dies and is resurrected. According to Greek legend, he was born from a myrrh tree, into which his mother had been changed. He was the beautiful lover of → Aphrodíte. When he was killed by a boar while hunting, the goddess caused the Adonis rose to spring up from his blood, and she was able to secure his release from the underworld for six months in the year. The seeds of the so-called Adonis garden grow readily in a bowl or a box, and their blossoming and rapid withering were seen as symbolizing the life and death of the god. Adonis was taken over by the Etruscans under the name of → Atunis. Adraste (or Andraste \u0001 she who is invin- cible) A goddess of war in ancient Britain, to whom Queen Boudicca (AD 61) had captured Roman women sacrificed. A parallel is found in Gaul where the Vicontii had a goddess of war named Andarta. Adraste 3"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Adrásteia (‘the inescapable’) Originally a Trojan-Phrygian mountain divinity who was also worshipped in Thrace and who appears in Greece from about 400 BC onwards as the guardian of righteousness and the goddess who avenges all wrongs; connected with → Nemesis. Whether there is any common Indo-Germanic connection with the Celtic-British → Adraste is not clear. Adro A god of the Lugbara people who live on the shores of Lake Albert in East Africa. He lives with his wives and children on earth, preferably in rivers, and he makes himself known to humans in the shape of whirlwinds and grass fires. The celestial aspect of this earthly god is known as Adroa, a divinity in his own right, who created mankind in days gone by, but who now lives at infinite removal from us. Aegir A north Germanic sea-giant, husband of → Ran. At a carousal for the Aesir ( → As), he had shining gold brought into the hall which was lit up as though by fire. It has been suggested that the gold represents the shimmering of tranquil seas without wind. Aenéas To begin with, a Greek hero (Greek: Aineias) in the Trojan War, the son of King Anchises and the goddess → Aphrodíte, the mother of the gods from Mount Ida. The saga of his flight from the ruins of Troy became known to the Romans and the Etruscans in the sixth century BC; and soon thereafter he him- self was honoured as a heros . For the Romans he was the embodiment of the old Roman virtue of pietas (piety, rever- ence for age and tradition) thanks to his having rescued his father (lamed by light- ning) and the holy images, and taken them with him on his wanderings. The emperor Augustus believed that his family was descended from the son of the gods, Aenéas. Aesculápius The god of healing → Asklepiós, introduced into Rome during a plague in 293 BC. In his capacity as all- healer, he became one of the most popu- lar gods of the early Empire. The emperor Marcus Aurelius had himself depicted as Aesculápius, bearing a caduceus as sceptre. In modern times the caduceus has become the symbol of the medical profession. A ey ma Da e va ( a e sma \u0001 madness) The Parsee demon of lust and anger. His wrath is directed mainly against the cow, which occupies the central place among the creatures. Only by → Sao m yant can he be finally overcome. Aetérnitas For the Romans the person- ification of eternity, both of the Empire and of the deified emperors. Symbolically rep- resented by the phoenix perpetually arising from the ashes of its own burning, and the snake biting its own tail (Uroboros): both of these illustrating a process which has no beginning and no end. Afi God of rain and thunderstorms among the Abkhaz people who live in the western Caucasus. His name must not be uttered by women, who call him simply ‘the one who is above’. Aga y (Avestan \u0001 ‘evil eye’) A demon of illness in Iranian religions: primarily a demon of those sins which are commit- ted by means of the eye. Agathós Daímon A good genius or guardian spirit in ancient Greek mythol- ogy. It was often imagined as a winged serpent which hovers invisibly round a man and brings good luck to his home. Agdistis (Agditis) A hermaphrodite being in Phrygian mythology. It is 4 Adrásteia"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"descended from → Papas, made drunk by → Diónysos, and emasculates itself on waking from its drunken stupor. An almond tree grows from its sexual organs, and the fruit of this tree makes the daugh- ter of the river-god → Sangarios preg- nant. She gives birth to → Attis. Agdistis, now in its female aspect as a form of the Great Mother ( → Kybéle), falls in love with the beautiful youth Attis; when he is unfaithful to her, she makes him lose his reason. Aglaia → Charites Aglibol The moon-god of Palmyra (ancient Syria). He bears the sickle moon on his forehead – at a later date, on his shoulders. The name is sometimes explained as ‘bull of Bol’, which would suggest that the sickle was originally bull’s horns. His cult spread via Greece to Rome. Agni (etymologically connected with Latin ignis \u0001 fire) The Vedic god of fire. He carries the sacrificial burnt offer- ing to the gods. There are two or three versions of his birth: on the one hand, he is said to be born from heaven, from the sun or from lightning, but then again he is born from an earthly source, from stone or from water, in which extinguished fire resides. As portrayed, he is reddish in hue, with a long beard and clothed in fire; in his hands he carries flames, a trident and a water-pot. He is said to be mounted on a ram or a male goat. In old texts Agni is described as the ‘bull of the waters’, that is to say, he makes the water pregnant: a symbolical reference to the cosmic process, in which (male) fire enters into (female) water. Agni is an intermediary between mankind and the gods, especially when he appears in the sacrificial fire. Agnóstos Theós (Greek \u0001 ‘the unknown god’) It seems that altars to ‘unknown gods’ were set up in Athens. In his address to the men of Athens (Acts of the Apostles 17: 23) Paul uses the singular – ‘To the unknown god’ – but this seems to be a monotheistic adaptation. As far as the his- tory of religion is concerned, there is no doubt that ‘all gods’ (Pantheon) were invoked and worshipped – gods who are not named but who are not nameless. An unknown or anonymous god is also attested in pre-Islamic Arabia, and votive inscriptions from Palmyra (second and third centuries AD) are addressed to him ‘whose name is praised for ever and ever’. His epithets are ‘Lord of the world’ and ‘the good one’. Ah Bolom Tzacab In scholarly litera- ture known also as god K or as ‘the leaf- nosed god’ because of the leaf-shaped ornament he wears in his nose. He was the Mayan god of agriculture, and was supposed to control rain and thunder. Ahone The supreme deity of Indians who once lived in the Virginia area. He was so far removed from men, so remote, that they did little to honour him. In this, he differs from → Okeus. Ahriman Middle Persian and modern Farsi version of the Avestan name Angru Mainyu (‘evil spirit’), the name given by Zarathustra to → Ahura Mazda’s adver- sary who counters every act of creation with an act of anti-creation. Ahriman is the embodiment of all evil; he inhabits an underground realm of eternal darkness, from which he brings smoke and black- ness, sickness and death into the world. His symbolical creature is the snake. At the end of time, he will subside power- less into darkness. In Mithraism and Zervanism Ahriman is venerated as a god; his rituals include the sacrifice of those animals which belong to the powers of evil. Cf. also → Arimanius. Ahriman 5"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Ahura Mazda appointed judge of the dead. He is first mentioned by name in Plato. Aíolos (Latin: Aeolus) The son of → Poseidon; in Greek mythology, the pro- genitor of the Aeolians, directed by → Zeus to rule the winds. It was he who gave Odysseus a bag containing contrary winds to speed the homeward journey. Aión (Greek \u0001 time) The word may refer to an age or epoch in the history of the world, or to the god himself who per- sonifies such an age. He is depicted in human form, entwined in serpents and with the head of a lion. He is often winged and sometimes shown standing in the Zodiac. He figures in the mysteries of Mithras, whose concept of Aion is of Persian origin ( → Zervan). The Lord of Time is also a primeval god (known as Aion to the Manichaeans), and he enters Greek thought in the shape of → Krónos, which in the course of further philo- sophical speculation, coalesces with its homonym → Chronos. Airyaman Etymologically related to the Modern Persian erman \u0001 guest. The Old Iranian god corresponding to the Vedic → Aryaman. To begin with, he was a sort of collective deity whose duties included supervision of such social bonds and contracts as hospitality and marriage. 6 Ahura Mazda Later Ormazd (old Persian \u0001 ‘Lord or wisdom’). The name of the one true God preached by Zarathustra. Originally Ahura Mazda was conceived as ruling over the oppositional pair Spenta Mainyu and Angru Mainyu ( → Ahriman), but later he became conceptually identified with Spenta Mainyu. In the teaching of Zarathustra, light is made visible by Ahura Mazda and serves in his praise. Subsequently the paramount light, the sun, appears as the form of the god, and in the Avesta the sun and the moon are described as his eyes. Over against the world of truth and light which he has cre- ated, stands the anti-world of deception and darkness. By means of fire, Ahura Mazda can distinguish good from evil. On Achaemenian seals the god is depicted in a winged ring (the sun or the moon); sometimes his body projects upwards out of the ring. This type of representation was taken over from Assyria (cf. illustra- tion to → Assur). Ahurani ‘She who belongs to Ahura’, an Old Iranian water-goddess, to whom people prayed for growth, insight and progeny. Libation formed part of the ritual in her honour. Aiakós A Greek god of the under- world, the son of Zeus and of Aigina.

At the end of time he will fish the souls of those tem- porarily damned out of hell by means of a net. Eschatologically he may coincide with → Srao m a. Ai Tojon The creator of light among the Yakuts (in Siberia). He is conceived as a giant, double-headed eagle, which perches on the tip of the world-tree. Aitu In Samoa, a portmanteau word for the lower order of gods who are called Atua in the Marquesas. Included here are, above all, the various tutelary gods of var- ious families and villages, who appear in the shape of plants or animals. One Aitu known as Fe’e ( \u0001 cuttlefish, squid) started out as a god of war but gradually took over the role of ruler over the king- dom of the dead. The Aitu often display demonic rather than godly characteristics. The word ‘aitu’ is also used in Maori, where it means not only ‘deity’ but also ‘sickness’ or ‘misery’. Aitvaras A Lithuanian household spirit which appears as a black cat or a black cock. When he flies in the sky he looks like a wavy line. He is a creature of the devil, which persuades the householder to sell his soul for a rich reward. Aius Locútius (Latin \u0001 the speaker) A Roman nonce-god who is supposed to have given a warning of the approach of the Gauls (391 BC). A k ay agarbha (‘whose origin is the ether’) In Indian Buddhism, a → Bodhisattva with the characteristics of a celestial deity. He holds jewels in his hands, and his symbol is the sun. He appears in the Tibetan Books of the Dead as Nam-mkhai snying-po , yellowish in colour and furnished with sword and bell as attributes. In Japan he is known as Kokuzo, and is a personification of supreme knowledge of the absolute void ( fu nyata ). Aképhalos This is not really a proper name, but rather the designation of a ‘headless’ being which was regarded as a demon in antiquity. There were many of these: originally beheaded for criminal offences, they became ghosts or acolytes in magic practices. In Hellenistic Egyptian papyri dealing with magic, spells and incantations, the akephalos is even addressed as God; here we may per- haps see the influence of the myth of the dismembered → Osiris. Aker In ancient Egyptian texts his name is written with the determinant for ‘Earth’, and the god himself is an embod- iment of the earth. He is represented as a narrow strip of land with either a human or a lion’s head at the ends; later, this becomes two lions with their backs turned to each other, which bear the hieroglyph of the rising sun. One lion looks towards the west where the sun sets; the other faces east where the sun rises again from the realm of darkness. The two lions and hence the god they represent guard the entrance and the exit of the underworld. Akerbeltz (‘black billy-goat’) In Basque popular belief, Akerbeltz is the representative of the god → Mari. In accordance with his name he is depicted as a black billy-goat. People who want their animals to do well turn to him for help. In earlier times, a black billy-goat was kept in the farm-steading to protect the herd from plague and sickness. In the sixteenth/seventeenth centuries he was venerated as a god by witches and wiz- ards; sacrifices were made to him, and dance formed part of the ritual in his honour. Akerbeltz 7"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Akongo The supreme god of the Ngombe who live in the Congo area. As creator, he bears the epithet ‘he who forms’; that is, it is he who gave the world its shape. Ak s obhya (‘the unshakable’) One of the five → Dhy a ni-Buddhas: probably an hypostasis of the historical → Gautama Buddha, with reference to his withstand- ing the (legendary) temptations of the satanic → M a ra. Iconographically, he is represented as a Buddha clothed in the habit of a monk, and seated on a sun. He is celestially orientated on the east, and in Tantrism the eye of the Buddha, the ele- ment ether and the season of winter are attributed to him. In Tantric iconography he may be given six or eight arms; his main attribute is the vajra , the thun- derbolt, and he rides on a pair of ele- phants. Several divinities emanate from Ak s obhya, including → Heruka, → Jambhala, Yamari. Ala Earth-goddess of the Ibo people in East Nigeria. She represents the earth in its dual aspect – fecundity and death. Alako A god of the Norwegian gyp- sies. His original name was Dundra, and he was sent down to earth in human shape by his father, the great God, to reveal their secret law and lore to the gypsies. When this was accomplished he returned to his own realm in the moon, and has ever since been known as Alako. The name is etymologically related to the Finnish word alakuu \u0001 waning moon. Alalu The first among the heavenly kings according to the pantheon of the Hurrians who lived in North Syria in the second millennium BC. For nine years he occupied his divine throne before he was overthrown by Anu, the first of the gods. Alalu was called Hypsistos (‘the highest’) by the Greeks. Alardi In the popular belief of the Ossetians in the Central Caucasus a spirit who on the one hand causes smallpox and, on the other, protects women. In folksong he is given the epithet ‘the winged one’. Alaunus A local Celtic name for the god → Mercurius. In the Mannheim area, Mercurius was given the epithet Alannus; near Salzburg, inscriptions have been found giving the form ‘sacrum . . . Alounis’. Albiorix (‘King of the World’) Epithet, perhaps also a specific form of the Gallic war-god → Teutates. Alcis A divine pair of brothers in the belief of the East Germanic tribe of the Naharnavali (in Silesia?). According to Tacitus they were worshipped in a sacred grove, and they were never depicted. In the interpretatio romana they are identi- fied with the heavenly twins → Castor and Pollux. The etymology of the word Alcis is not clear. It may be connected with the word alces which Caesar notes as meaning ‘elk’, and this would make the Alcis brothers elk or stag gods. Alisanos (attested also in the form Alisanus) A local god in Gaul, men- tioned in inscriptions found in the Côte d’Or. The place-name Alesia may well be connected with him. Attempts have been made to identify him more closely as a mountain-ash god, or god of rowan trees. Allah (Arabic, al-ilah \u0001 the God) In the pre-Islamic period, the supreme deity, creator of the earth and giver of water. Interpreted monotheistically by Muhammad as the one true God, to whom it is incumbent upon men to submit ( isl a m \u0001 submission).

The ‘beautiful names’ of God correspond to the epithets which are used to paraphrase Allah in the Qur’an: 99 names are known (hence the 99 beads in the Islamic rosary) but the ‘greatest name’, the name which will complete the hundred, is known to no mortal. In Islamic mysticism (Sufism) Allah is compared to a sun which sends forth its rays; his throne is a sign of his omnipotence and of his remoteness from his creation. Since graphical representa- tion of Allah is forbidden, it is only in cal- ligraphy that he can be spiritually ‘presented’. Allat (‘the goddess’) Venerated in Central and North Arabia in pre-Islamic times. Herodotus records the Semitic name in the form Alilat. She was particu- larly revered in Ta’if where an idol to her, a white granite block, stood. She was sup- posed to be one of the three daughters of → Allah, and was associated with the planet Venus. Certain texts also seem to point to a solar connection. Allekto → Erinyes Almaqah Moon-god and tutelary god of the South Arabian kingdom of Saba. Members of the tribe of Saba called them- selves ‘the children of Almaqah’. He is symbolized by a cluster of lightning flashes and a weapon which looks like a slightly bent capital S. His symbolical animal is the bull, and in some texts he is referred to as ‘Lord of the horned goats’. Aloádes In Greek mythology the giant sons of Aloeus (or of → Poseidon) named Otos and Ephialtes. In their fight against the gods they try to storm Olympus; and they bind the god of war → Arés fast and hold him captive for 13 months. When → Ártemis throws herself between them in the shape of a hind, they kill themselves in their blind lust to hunt down the quarry. It is possible that the Aloades were pre- Hellenic gods, who were casualties in the struggle surrounding the introduction of the new religion of Zeus. Alp (Alb) Old Norse alfr . The original designation of the mythical → Elben. In Germanic mythology, the Albs were unearthly beings, half god half dwarf: and here we may recall Alberich, the king of the dwarfs in the Nibelungensage, famed for his Tarnkappe which conferred invisi- bility, and the magic belt that gave him strength. In later years, the Albs came to be known as demonic beings which caused sickness and nightmares. In popu- lar superstition the nightmare – a terrify- ing experience during sleep, followed by an equally terrifying awakening – is explained as induced by a threatening demon ( → Incubus, → Succubus). In Bavaria and Austria, the evil female demons known as Druden take the place of the Albs. Alpan (also Alpanu, Alpnu) An Etruscan goddess, variously portrayed as winged or unwinged, belonging to the female demons known as → Lasas. She is naked except for a cloak which hardly conceals her body, she is richly bejewelled and wears light sandals. The Alpan 9"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"evidence strongly suggests that she was a goddess of the art of love, but she also possesses traits that mark her as a goddess of the underworld. Amaethon A Celtic god of agriculture in Wales, revered as the great ploughman. He belongs to the Welsh family of gods of the Don. Amáltheia (in Latin Amalthéa) A nymph or, in other versions of the story, a she-goat which nourished the infant → Zeus with her milk, and was rewarded by being transferred to the heavens where she figures as Capella (Latin, \u0001 goat). A horn broken off from Amáltheia was transformed by Zeus into the cornucopia, the symbol of plenty. Amaterasu (Japanese \u0001 ‘shining from heaven’) The sun-goddess of Shintoism, venerated in the shrine at Ise as the divine progenitor of the Japanese imperial fam- ily. Her epithet is Omikami: ‘great and exalted divinity’. The myth tells how she arose together with the moon (god) when the god of heaven Izanagi washed his eyes on his return from the under- world. Angered by the atrocities com- mitted by the storm-god → Susanowo, Amaterasu withdrew to a cave, and all light faded from the earth; but the other gods used a mirror to entice her back again. Amaunet One of the group of Egyptian gods known as the Ogdoad. She was seen as the Divine Mother pre- siding at the beginning of time, when she merged with → Neith. In inscriptions she is named as ‘the mother who was the father’; that is to say, she needed no spouse. Within the Ogdoad, → Amun is allotted to her as partner. In the Ptolemaic era she was seen as the embodiment of the life-bringing north wind. Amenominakanushi (Japanese \u0001 Lord of the bright centre of heaven) The supreme heavenly divinity in Shintoism. In contradistinction to → Izanagi, he plays no part in myth, nor is there any record of a shrine or place of worship in his honour. Nevertheless he occupies first place in the list of gods: transcending all of them, he sits alone on a nine-fold layer of clouds (a symbolical reference to the nine heavens). Amentet Egyptian goddess of the west and of the lands lying in that direction. As the sun sets in the west (symbolizing the entrance to the underworld) Amentet is also the goddess of the necropolis where she receives the dead as they enter the Beyond. Ameret a t (‘non-death’, ‘life’) In Old Iranian religion, Ameret a t belongs to the circle of Ame m va Spentas, where she rep- resents immortality. She is usually men- tioned together with → Haurvat a t, whose dominion is over the waters, while Ameret a t rules the plant world. In the Yasna the two goddesses figure as the food and drink of heaven. For the faithful, they represent the reward awaiting them after death. As abstract concepts they are both feminine, but when personified each can take on male gender. In the final sac- rifice Ameret a t is united with her earthly symbol, the world of plants. Ame y a Spentas (‘the holy immortals’) In the religion of the Parsees, a collective title for the personifications of abstract concepts who serve → Ahura Mazda as his archangels. Five of the Ame m a Spentas may well have arisen from elemental spir- its via a process of reinterpretation: A m a (Avestan \u0001 truth) is symbolized by fire in the Gathas, Kh m athra vairya (‘desired realm’) is the protector of metals, and is often represented as god of war; 10 Amaethon"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"→ Armaiti (‘compliance, compliant thought/speech’) is closely connected with the earth, while → Haurvat a t (‘per- fection’) is associated with water, and Ameret a t (‘immortality’) with plants. To this original group of five, → Vohu Manah (‘sound views’) and → Srao m a (‘obedi- ence’) were added as archangels after Zarathustra. On occasion, → Spenta Mainyu and even Ahura Mazda himself are mentioned as ‘holy immortals’. Amida Japanese form of → Amit a bha, a dogmatic development of the eleventh/twelfth centuries. Amida is also given the Sanskrit name Amit a yuh (‘immeasurable life’), a reference to the Buddha who possesses the properties of immeasurable light and life. In the J o do faith, teaching concerning Amida coa- lesces with the belief in J o do, the Pure Land. Thereafter, simple evocation of the name of Amida Buddha is enough to ensure release, provided belief is deep and genuine. Amit a bha (Sanskrit \u0001 immeasurable light; Chinese A-mi-t’o or O-mi-to) The most popular of the five → Dhy a ni- Buddhas. He is enthroned in heaven as lord of the paradisical land of Sukhavati, entry into which is vouchsafed to all who believe in him. His celestial direction is the west, his element is water and he is associated with the evening twilight. In iconography, he is represented as a red- coloured Buddha, both of his hands lie open in his lap in the pose of meditation. His ceremonial vehicle is a pair of pea- cocks, and he is symbolized by a lotus or an alms-bowl. The Amit a bha cult reached China from India in the fourth – sixth centuries AD, and spread thence to Japan ( → Amida). Amm The moon-god in pre-Islamic South Arabia. In the kingdom of Qataban he had the status of a tutelary national god, and the people of Qataban called themselves ‘the children of Amm’. His lunar character is indicated by his epithet: ‘he who waxes’. In addition, he acts as a weather god, and in this capacity he is symbolized by a cluster of lightning flashes. Amma The divine creator in the reli- gious system of the Dogon (in Mali). He created the universe in the form of a world-egg which was divided into two placentas: from these, the bi-sexual world arose. According to a different and occult tradition, the god raped the earth, whose sexual organ was an ant-hill. Ammavaru A mother-goddess of the Telugu, a Dravidian people who live in east-central India. According to the myth, she existed before the coming to being of the four ages, that is, before the creation of the world. From an egg which she laid in the Sea of Milk arose the three gods → Brahm a , Vi sj u, and → F iva. She rides on a jackal. Ammit A female demon who plays a part in the Egyptian Day of Judgment. She was feared as ‘devourer of the dead’, and she had the head of a crocodile, the torso of a predatory cat and the buttocks of a hippopotamus. This monster lurked near the scales of justice waiting for the verdict to be given, whereupon she devoured the sinner. Ammon The god of the West Egyptian oasis of Siwa, and of its oracle site (Ammonium) which was celebrated in antiquity. The god was represented as a ram. Ammon is the Greek form of → Amun. After visiting the Siwa oasis, Alexander the Great regarded himself as a son of Zeus-Ammon, much as the Pharaohs were held to be sons of Amun- Re. North African rock drawings showing Ammon 11"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the ram bearing the disc of the sun are held to be outliers of the Ammon (Amun) cult. Amoghap aq a (‘unfailing noose’) In Mahayana Buddhism, a form of → Avalokite f vara. He is white in colour, has a face and eight arms, and stands with his feet close together on the moon. His main attribute is the noose (a hypostatization of compassion) with which he lassoes the faithful, much to their benefit. Amoghasiddhi (‘flawless perfection’) In Buddhism, one of the five Dhy a ni- Buddhas; he is green in colour and assigned to the northerly quarter. His vehicle consists of a pair of Garu d as (mythological eagle-like birds), and his attribute is a double thunderbolt ( vi f vava- jra ). He is associated with the bodily eye, the rainy season and the element of water. In Tantrism he may be represented with three faces and six arms. Ámor The Roman god of love, corre- sponding to the Greek → Éros. In Latin poetry Amor is also called Cupido ( cupid- itas \u0001 longing, lust, passion). In the Christian Middle Ages, a distinction was made between Amor or Amor Dei ( \u0001 God) and Cupido ( \u0001 the devil). In classical art, Amor was represented as a puer alatus (winged youth); his attributes are a bow and arrows and/or a torch. The story of Amor and Psyche has been popular since the early Hellenistic period. Here, Psyche, representing the caducity of human life on earth, is awakened by Amor’s kiss to life eternal. Amphitríte A goddess of the sea, pos- sibly pre-Hellenic. In Greek mythology, she is the daughter of → Nereus, and the wife of → Poseidon. Accompanied by Nereids and Tritons she moves over the waters in a vessel made of mussels. It was only in association with Poseidon that she was made an object of worship. Amun 12 Amoghap aq a (‘the hidden one’) In the Pyramid texts he is already mentioned as a primeval god, in association with his wife → Amaunet. In Old Egyptian thought he was the moving agent in the invisible breeze; thus he was venerated as god of the wind and ruler of the air. From the eleventh dynasty onwards he is attested as god of Thebes. Here, he coalesces with the sun- god ( → Re) to become Amun-Re, and, as Thebes increased in power, he became king of the gods and tutelary god of the empire. In his capacity as primeval god of creation he is venerated in the shape of a goose; otherwise, the ram is his sacred animal, a reference to his function as god of fertility. After the fall of Thebes his cult prospered in Ethiopia and among the oasis dwellers ( → Ammon). An (Anu) In Sumerian the name means ‘above’, ‘heaven’ and is written in the cuneiform character with the same sign as the word for ‘God’ ( dingir ). His consort is variously given as Ki (the earth) or the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"goddess Antum. An is the supreme god of the Sumerian pantheon, and the centre of his cult was at Uruk. In the Babylonian period his eminence as god of heaven is still stressed, but his role in religious observance is no longer an important one. In the main he is not favourably disposed towards human beings to whom he sends, for example, the demon → Lama m tu and the goddess of death → M a mitu. Among the Hurrians, Anu was regarded as the successor of → Alalu. Ana (or Anu) Celtic-Irish goddess of the earth and of fertility. She was said to be the mother of the gods. Two hills near Killarney in Munster are called after her Da Chich Anann: i.e. the two breasts of Ana. Anahita (‘the immaculate’) Originally, a Semitic goddess related to → Anath, she was received into the pantheon of the Parsees as a goddess of fertility and of victory. She is pictured as a maiden in a mantle of gleaming gold, with a diadem and jewels. In iconography she wears a high crown, in her left hand she often carries a water-pot (in her capacity as goddess of water) and at her breast she carries a pomegranate blossom. The dove and the peacock are sacred to her .Temple prostitution formed part of her cult. In the Avestan calendar, the tenth day and the eighth month are dedicated to her. In Middle Persian tradition she is called Ardvi Sur, and in Asia Minor she was assimilated to the Great Mother. After the conquest of Babylonia by the Persians some traits of → I m tar as goddess of love and of the planets were transferred to Anahita. Ananké Greek goddess of fate. As the personification of ineluctable necessity, of inevitability, she is even set above the gods. In Orphic teaching she is incorporeal but universally present. On occasion she fuses with the figure of → Adrásteia. In her capacity as ‘she who guides the worlds’, she is portrayed holding a spindle. Anat(h) To begin with, a Phoenician- Canaanite goddess whose name is inter- preted as meaning ‘providence’ or ‘precaution’. She is the maiden sister of → Baal, but also on occasion his spouse. In the Ugarit texts, she wreaks terrible revenge on the god of death → Mot, on behalf of her dead brother. She was taken over by various peoples in Hither Asia as the goddess of nature and life, and con- tributed something towards the make-up of → Astarte and of → Atargatis. From the Ramessids onwards, Anat was also venerated in Egypt as a goddess of war; in this capacity her attributes include shield, spear and axe, and also a high crown with two ostrich feathers. Anbay A pre-Islamic god in south Arabia. His name may have been origi- nally a regal plural and may be etymolog- ically connected with the name of the old Mesopotamian god → Nabu (‘the harbin- ger’). Anbay is an oracular god and ‘Lord of justice’. In his capacity as ‘spokesman’ (‘harbinger’) he acts for the moon-god ( → Amm) who ranks above him in the pantheon. Anezti (Anedjti) God of the ninth nome of Lower Egypt, from whom → Osiris seems to have borrowed the crook and scourge as symbols of overlordship. A n giras ( a . ng \u0001 to say, announce, related to Greek angelos \u0001 angel) ‘The seers descended from the gods’ in the Veda and in Hinduism: ‘sons of heaven’ who by dint of sacrifice achieved immortality and the friendship of → Indra. Ani Etruscan god. On the bronze liver he is located at the exact north, that is to Ani 13"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"say, in the highest heaven. The name Ani may be etymologically connected with that of the Roman god → Janus. Whether two-visaged coins indicate an Etruscan Ianus bifrons is not certain: and equally doubtful is the claim that Ani comes from ianus (‘buttress’, ‘arched gate’) and is therefore connected with a sky-god (arch of heaven). Anky-Kele The god of the sea in the pantheon of the Chukchi people in north- east Siberia. As lord of the (sea)creatures, and hence of the food supply, he has power of life and death over the human race. Ánna Perénna An ancient Roman goddess. During the class war between the patricians and the plebeians she is supposed to have saved the latter from famine. She was worshipped in a grove lying to the north of Rome, and every year on 15 March there was a popular open-air festival in her honour. It is possi- ble that Ánna Perénna is a derivation of the Earth Mother. An y ar and Ki y ar According to the Babylonian creation epic Enuma Eli m , the third generation of gods and the parents of the sky-god ( → An). The name An m ar is construed as meaning ‘totality of heaven’ or ‘horizon of heaven’; Ki m ar would then be ‘totality of earth’ or ‘earth horizon’. Similarity in sound led to the Assyrian national god → Assur being identified in the late Assyrian period with An m ar, and promoted to a position of supremacy over all the gods. Antaíos (in Latin Antaeus) According to Greek myth, the son of → Poseidon and the goddess of the earth → Gaia. The Greek word antaíos means ‘he who meets’. The giant Antaíos lived in Libya; and everyone whom he met there he challenged to a wrestling match and killed. Herakles finally overcame him by picking him up from the ground, thereby severing Antaios’ dynamic contact with Mother Earth. Anubis 14 Anky-Kele Egyptian god of the dead, in the shape of a dog or a jackal; occasionally in human shape with a dog’s head. It is not certain what the name means; the meaning ‘little dog’ has been suggested. At Assiut, Anubis was known by the epithet ‘Lord of the cave mouth’, i.e. the entrance into the city of the dead. As god of the dead he is ‘Lord of the divine hall’ and hence in charge of mummification, in which capacity he undertakes the ritual prepara- tion of the corpse and its transfiguration. With the rise of → Osiris, Anubis was demoted vis-à-vis the new Lord of the Dead and put in charge of weighing the hearts at the last judgment. The Greeks gave the name Kynopolis to important centres of worship. In the interpretatio graeca Anubis was identified with → Hérmes. Anuket (Greek form Anukis) Egyptian goddess of the Cataract area. Particularly venerated in Elephantine, she was also known as ‘mistress of Nubia’. Her sacred animal was the gazelle."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Anunna (Sumerian \u0001 ‘those who are of princely seed’) Collective title for the pantheon of a given locality: e.g. the Anunna of Laga m , or for the gods of heaven and earth. In Akkadian (the lan- guage spoken in Babylonia and Assyria) the loan-word Anunnaku denotes the lower gods in contra-distinction to the gods who dwell in heaven ( → Igigi). Anyigba → Trowo Ap a m nap a t (‘Grandchild of the waters’) In Old Iranian belief a ‘god found in the water’. He is the giver of water to men, but he also acts in a military capacity. He is the hero who quells rebellious lands. His epithet is ‘owner of swift steeds’. Vedic India had a god of the same name; according to the Rigveda he is golden in appearance and he distributes water. It is possible that → Poseidon as he appears on Bactrian coins is a mutation of the Old Iranian water-god. Apar a jita (‘the unconquered’) Belongs to the → Krodhadevat a s of Indian Buddhism. He is white in colour, and dec- orated with snakes. He has three faces – white, black and red. In pre-Buddhist belief he seems to have figured as leader of the demons, and as such is trampled underfoot by → Bh u tad a mara. Apar a jit a (‘the unconquered one’ (female)) A female deity in Indian Buddhism; she is yellow in colour and has one head and two arms, and is bedecked with jewels. Her countenance arouses ter- ror, and she tramples → Ga j e f a under- foot. She scatters all devilish beings ( → M a ras) and unruly gods like → Brahm a are obliged to hold her sunshade over her head. Aphrodíte Greek goddess of beauty and love, identified by the Romans with → Venus. Attempts to derive her name from the Greek word aphros \u0001 foam, date back to antiquity. On this interpretation, the goddess is ‘she who is born of the foam’; or, as another of her names – Anadyomene – suggests ‘she who arises from the sea’. Her cult is pre-Greek and probably oriental in origin; certain rites associated with her, like the temple pros- titution in Corinth, remind us of → Astarte. She was also known as Kypris and as Kythereia after the main shrines in her honour on Cyprus and Kythera. In coastal areas she was revered as Euploia – ‘she who confers a good voy- age’. Plato and others make a distinction between the ‘heavenly’ Aphrodite (Urania) and the goddess who ‘belongs to the whole people’ (Pandemos). According to Homer, Aphrodite was the daughter of → Zeus and Dione, married to → Hephaistos but in love with → Arés, a liaison from which → Éros was born. She also loved the beautiful → Adonis. Her attribute was the dove. Her aegis cov- ered fertility in the plant world, and she was venerated in Athens as the goddess of gardens. Aphrodíte 15"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Apis (in Egyptian Hapi) Holy bull worshipped in Memphis. He was origi- nally a symbol of fertility, but in the course of time he acquired other charac- teristics; above all, he came to be identi- fied with the ‘glorious soul’ of → Ptah. After his death, Apis enters the god → Osiris, and the compound Osiris-Apis (in Grecianized form Serapis) is used to denote the ensuing mixta persona . Apis became a god of the dead. From the New Kingdom onwards he wears the disc of the sun as a head-dress. Apis-bulls were regarded as holy and were interred in sub- terranean burial chambers in the so-called Serapeum. Herodotus identifies Apis with → Epaphos. Aplu An Etruscan god borrowed from the Greek pantheon ( → Apollon), latterly specified as god of thunder and lightning. He is pictured as naked except for a man- tle which covers part of his body; on his head is a wreath of laurel and he holds in his hands a staff which usually ends in a laurel twig. The god figures in various myths, but there is no trace of a cult devoted to him. Apo Katawan ‘Master’ or ‘Father’ Katawan: a god of the Hambal-Aeta, a negrito tribe in the Philippines. Sacrifice is made to him, and people pray to him. Apóllon A Greek god, probably of Asia Minor origin. He fulfills several functions: as protector of cattle, he keeps wolves away (hence his name of Lykeios); as pro- moter of agriculture he gets rid of field- mice (Smintheus); and as a stone pillar standing in front of a house he protects both it and its inhabitants (Apollon Agyieus). He is a god of healing (with a snake as attribute) and a god of expiation, whose arrows bring sickness and death. Above all, however, he is the god of ora- cles, his most celebrated oracular shrines being Delphi and Delos. The laurel plant is sacred to him. As god of the muses Apollon Musagetes he is often represented with a lyre, and singing and music are in his gift. Finally, from the sixth century onwards he was demonstrably venerated as a sun-god. His epithet Phoebus (‘the bright or pure one’) was originally understood in a purely cultic sense, but it soon acquired ethical connotations. The myth relates how he slew the Python dragon, only a few days after his birth. His parents were → Zeus and → Leto, his twin sister was → Artemis, and his son was the god of heal- ing → Asklepios. Apóllon was the first Greek god to be introduced into Italy (Etruscan → Aplu). Augustus saw him as his personal tutelary god. Apophis An Egyptian monster, reptil- ian in nature, which lives in darkness and which threatens the sun-god in his daily journey across the heavens. Apophis is a rebel against divine and cosmic order. It is told in the hymns to the sun how the snake-demon is sliced with knives or pierced by a lance. In the late Egyptian 16 Apis"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"period, Apophis came to be identified with → Seth. Apsaras Vedic water-spirits. As heav- enly beings they are coupled with the musicians of the world of the gods ( → Gandharvas). They are fond of games of chance, and confer good fortune at the gaming table. According to the Atharvaveda, they can cause madness. It has been suggested that the name derives from Sanskrit ap \u0001 water and sar \u0001 to stream. Apsu (Akkadian; the Sumerian form is Abzu) Personification of the sweet- water ocean lying under the earth, which united with → Tiamat at the beginning of time. According to Sumerian myth, Abzu is the place where the goddess → Nammu formed the first men from clay. The Babylonian creation epic relates how Apsu is slain by the magic weapons of the goddess → Ea. It is in Apsu – that is to say, in the water – that Marduk is finally born. Aralez The ancient Armenians believed in the existence of these dog-like creatures gifted with supernatural powers. Their specific function was to lick the wounds of those killed or wounded in battle, who then recovered or were resurrected to new life. In the popular mind they were beneficent dog-like spirits who lived in heaven; at an earlier date they may well have been seen as god-like creatures of a menial order. Aralo → Aray Aramazd (from Old Persian → Ahura Mazda) The supreme deity of the ancient Armenians, creator of heaven and earth. He has a son → Mihr, and a daugh- ter → Nana. He was taken over by the pre-Christian Georgians under the name of → Armaz. In the ascendancy of the Greek pantheon he was identified with → Zeus. Arapacana A → Bodhisattva, one- faced, red or white in colour and resplen- dent like the full moon. He sits in meditative pose on a double lotus. In his right hand he wields a sword, in his left he holds a book which he presses to his breast. Aray (also Ara) Old Armenian god of war, known as ‘the beautiful’. Probably of common Indo-Germanic origin along with → Ares (originally a Thracian god). However, Aray also has certain character- istics of a dying god who rises again, which lends some support to the thesis that this Armenian god was identical with the Hittite god of the countryside who bore the same name. It is possible that this god lives on in Aralo, the Georgian god of agriculture. Arduinna A local goddess in Gaul, named after the Ardennes. She was a god- dess of hunting, and interpreted by the Romans as equivalent to → Diana. Her sacred animal was the boar. Arebati Mythical sky-god of the Bambuti (Pigmy people on the Ituri in Congo). He is the ruler of the world, who created the first man by kneading his body from clay, covering it with a skin and pouring blood into the vessel thus formed. His epithet afa ( \u0001 father) is to be understood in the same sense. Arés (accented in Latin on first syllable: Áres) Greek god of war. Etymologically, his name is not entirely clear, but it proba- bly means something like ‘destroyer’ or ‘avenger’. He is accompanied by → Eris (dissension), Enyo (horror) and Phobos (fear). His original homeland was Thrace, and few temples were devoted to him in Hellas. He was not a popular god, and Arés 17"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"accordingly he is not often portrayed in Greek art. His parents were → Zeus and → Hera, and his mistress was → Aphrodíte.

Argaulídes → Kékrops Árgos In Greek mythology a many- eyed giant entrusted by → Hera to keep guard on → Io; he was, however, lulled to sleep by → Hérmes and killed. His name has become proverbial for eyes which miss nothing. Arhat (Sanskrit, ‘he who is worthy of reverence’) In Buddhism and Jainism a saint, one who has reached the highest stage of perfection possible on earth. In H i nay a na Buddhism, the ideal figure who has reached the goal of self-deliverance, by means of asceticism and meditation; in Mah a y a na Buddhism, the → Bodhisattva who shows others the way to salvation and sacrifices himself for them, is more highly venerated. Essentially, the Arhat is a human being, but he is endowed with the heavenly eye which he uses to perceive the ebb and flow of beings in the different worlds. In the pantheon of Chinese Buddhism, the Arhats (called in Chinese lo-han ) form a third class after the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas, thus still occupying a higher position than the gods. In Jainism, the Arhats are removed in their perfection from all earthly desires and actions, and they are revered as ‘supreme gods’. Ariádne Originally a Minoan goddess; her Cretan name Aridela means ‘she who shines in splendour’. Her death as described in Homer suggests a goddess of vegetation. In the myth, Ariádne is the daughter of the Cretan king → Minos and of → Pasiphae. She uses a ball of wool to help Theseus to find the way out of the mazes of the labyrinth. After her death, Ariádne was led out of the underworld by her husband → Dionysos and taken up to Olympus. Her crown was fixed by → Zeus as a constellation in the heavens (Corona Borealis). Arimanius (Areimanios) A variant name for the Persian → Ahriman, found in classical writers. According to Herodotus, a god of the underworld, ‘kakodaimon’ in contrast to the good spirit. Plutarch says he is an embodiment of Hades and the darkness invoked by Persian magi. Later he came to be identi- fied with the Egyptian god → Serapis (as god of the dead) as well.

Aristaíos An ancient Greek peasant god, protector of herds and the original bee-keeper. In Hellas he was ousted from favour by → Apóllon, as whose son he was subsequently regarded. In Kyrene (Libya) he continued to be venerated as the son of the goddess of the town. Arma A Hittite moon-god, correspon- ding to the Hurrian → Ku m uh. In hiero- glyphic Hittat his determinant is a sickle moon (Lunula). On reliefs he wears the sickle moon on his pointed and horned cap. On his back he has a pair of wings. Armaiti (also Aramati) Personification of ‘compliant speech’ (and thereby corre- sponding to the Vedic → Sarasvati) belonging to the → Ame m a Spentas. In the Gathas, Armaiti is closely associated with the earth and offers nourishment to the cow. She is goddess of the earth and hence of fertility, and also of the dead who have ‘gone into’ the earth. Ármány (Hungarian ármányos \u0001 cun- ning, insidious) The gloomy prospect facing the world was personified under this name in the Romantic movement in Hungary. First so used by Vörösmarty in 1825. Armaz The supreme deity in pre- Christian Georgia; corresponds to the Armenian → Aramazd. His cult represen- tation is described as clothed in golden armour, with a golden helmet and jewels. In his hand he carries a gleaming sword. Arsnuphis (also Harensnuphis) Greek form of Egyptian divine name meaning ‘the beautiful companion’. He is a Nubian god (‘Foremost of Nubia’) in the sense of the Egyptian → M u; and he is also identi- fied with the Nubian regional god → Dedun. He is often represented as a lion.

He is twin brother of Azizu ( → Azizos); together they represent the evening and the morning star, and are pictured in Palmyra as riding on camels or on horses. Ártemis Ártemis 19 Greek goddess of the hunt, who can be shown to share in the functions of several other divinities. She is Queen of the wild beasts ( Potnia theron ) in which capacity she can be traced back to the Minoan period. Graphically, she is represented as winged and accompanied by lions, deer and birds. Mainly, however, she appears as the virgin huntress roaming the woods with her attendants, the → Nymphs. She can use her arrows – like her brother → Apóllon – to send peaceful death or sud- den destruction. In anger she is terrible."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Originally, human sacrifice was not unknown to her cult – we may recall the story of Iphigenia who was replaced on the altar by a hind. She was also the god- dess of birth, and on Delos women sacri- ficed their hair to her in token of their devotion. She also appears as a goddess of vegetation and fertility (e.g. in the Peloponnese). In Asia Minor her cult overlapped that of the Great Mother (the many-breasted Artemis of Ephesus). Later, Artemis also came to be identified with the moon-goddess → Seléne. As bearer of light (Phosphoros) she had a temple in the harbour of Athens. The myth makes her the daughter of → Zeus and of → Leto.

The same god is found in Iran under the name of → Airyaman. As (pl. Aesir) In Norse mythology, the race of gods inhabiting Asgard were called the Aesir. The name comes from Old Norse ass \u0001 stake, beam, and this might suggest that the oldest representa- tions of these gods were carved stakes. At the head of the Aesir was → Odin, and they included → Thor, → Ty r , → Balder, → Heimdall, and the goddesses → Frigg, → Nanna, and → Sif. In the History of the Goths written by the historian Jordanes, the Aesir appear as deified ancestors (Gothic ansis ). The dividing line between the Aesir and the other race of Germanic gods, the → Vanir, is not fixed. A y Egyptian god, described as ‘Lord of Libya’, dating from the very earliest times. He is represented either anthropo- morphously or with a falcon’s head. Later, he continued to be worshipped in oases in the Libyan desert, and took on some char- acteristics of → Seth. He is often shown with the head of one of the animals sacred to Seth. Asag In Sumerian mythology a demon which dries up wells and covers the earth with sores into which it squirts poison.

Asmodaios (in Latin Asmodeus, in the Talmud A m medai) A demon ( → A em ma Da e va) taken from Old Iranian religion by the post-exile Jews (Tobias 3: 8, 17). In rabbinic literature he becomes the chief of the evil spirits. In some ways, Asmodaios is reminiscent of the Assyrian → Pazuzu. A q okak a nt a Sub-form of the Buddhist goddess → Marici. She rides on a pig and is golden-yellowish in colour. Sometimes she is pictured as standing on the moon above a lotus. She is clothed in white and she herself is bedecked with jewels; with her right hand she makes the varada-mudra gesture, indicating that certain wishes have been granted. Asopós Boeotian river-god (after the river of the same name in central Greece). Son of → Poseidon. When → Zeus abducted one of his daughters, Asopos himself was struck by lightning. Assur Originally the tutelary god of the town Assur; subsequently promoted to the rank of national god of Assyria. Etymologically the name is obscure. From the thirteenth century BC onwards, he gains the ascendancy over → Enlil, ousts him from the dominant role and takes over the epithets ‘Great Mountain’ and ‘Father of the Gods’. From the ninth century BC onwards he is equated with → An m ar. Among his functions are the judicial office, otherwise reserved to the sun-god, and the conduct of war. In Assyrian art he is shown as a god Assur 21 (in Latin, the accent is on e : Asklépios) Greek god of healing. His oldest known temple was at Trikka in Thessaly. It was only from the fifth century BC onwards that his cult spread over the whole of Hellas, and he began to oust his father → Apóllon as a divine healer. Originally he may have been a snake-god; and when new votive shrines were being dedicated to him, a snake was involved in the cere- mony as an incarnation of the god. He is usually pictured as a bearded man with his staff round which the sacred snake is entwined. The main centre of his cult was at Epidauros.

Astar (Ethiopic \u0001 sky, heavens) Often mentioned as god of heaven or sky-god in inscriptions dating from the time of the empire of Axum (Ethiopia, third to fifth centuries AD). The name is etymologi- cally related to the South Arabian → ’Attar. Astarte (A m tarat) Semitic goddess, associated mainly with Syria and Palestine. The Ugaritic form of her name is Attart; she appears in the Old Testament as → Asthoreth, and in Babylon as → I m tar. Her cult was that of an oriental god- dess of love and fertility, and was accord- ingly marked by many excesses (temple prostitution). She is usually shown naked. When she was taken over by the Egyptians she began to figure more and more as a goddess of war, and spear and bow were her attributes. Among the Greeks, Astarte was identified with → Aphrodíte as the heavenly goddess of love. As in the case of other fertility god- desses, her sacred creature was the dove. According to Philon of Byblos, she donned a bull’s head as a symbol of her ruling position, and there are other refer- ences to the horns assigned to her. Asteria → Perses Asthoreth A goddess worshipped in the Palestine area, corresponding to the Syrian → Astarte. She was principally a goddess of love and fertility, though among the Philistines she was a goddess of war. Solomon paid occasional homage to her, and even had a temple erected in her honour near Jerusalem (I Kings 11: 5; II Kings 23: 13). The plural form of her name is Astharoth, and this is used in con- junction with Baal as a collective name for the female divinities of the Canaanites (Judges 2: 13; I Samuel 12: 10). The bib- lical place-name Astharoth-Karnaim, i.e. ‘Astharoth with the two horns’, indicates that a horned goddess was visualized.

Ast o Vid a tu (Avestan ast \u0001 bone) The name may be roughly translated as ‘disin- tegrator of bodies’. Initially a minor demon, later promoted to the status of a god of death, whom no mortal can escape. From the moment of generation on, all men should know that his noose is already round their necks. For this reason, he has the epithet Marg \u0001 death. In Middle Persian texts he also appears as a chief representative of the devil. Asura In Indian Buddhism a group of demons who once upon a time lived in heaven but who were cast by the gods into the ocean. The story of the struggle between the gods and the Asura is a favourite theme in the Pali canon. In the Vedic religion, the Asura (Vedic, asu \u0001 life, life-force) were a primeval group of gods who were superseded by the up-and- coming → Devas. In the Atharvaveda and thereafter, the name denotes only demons. Asurakum a ra (‘Demon-princes’) In Jainism, the first group of the → Bhavanav a sin gods. They belong to the uppermost regions of the underworld; they are black in colour and their clothing is red. Like the gods, they are able to gen- erate rain and thunder. A q vin ( a f vin \u0001 having horses) Indian twin gods equivalent to the → Dioskúroi. They appear driving their horses in the morning sky, and they are givers of honey. The fact that they are twins is attested in the Rigveda. As divine healers they can cure the sick and rejuvenate the old. At a later period in Indian thought they are associated with → S u rya. As sons of → Dyaus, they are also called n a satyas . Ataecina Old Hispanic goddess, ven- erated in the region between the Tagus and the Guadalquivir. Interpreted by the Romans as equivalent to Proserpina. From inscriptions it is clear that she was regarded as a goddess of the underworld: one stele shows her holding a cypress branch. Atargatis Syrian Mother Goddess (Dea Syria) who was also venerated in Asia Minor and in Greece during the Hellenistic-Roman period. The centre of her cult was at Bambyke (Hierapolis) in Syria. The name Atargatis is a compound of → Astarte and → Anat, whose func- tions she took over, particularly those relating to fertility. The male partner allotted to her was → Adad. Her throne was flanked by lions; the ear (of wheat) and the coping stone were her attributes. In Askalon she was worshipped under the name Derketo in mermaid form. Áte Greek goddess of disaster; the embodiment of blind folly, benightedness, which stupefies man, mind and soul, and lands one in disaster. She was supposed to be a daughter of → Zeus. Atea The primeval god of Polynesian tradition: the space in light which was in the beginning sexless but which then divided itself into the god → Rangi (heaven, sky) and the goddess Papa. These two are the parents of all the gods. A Tahitian myth relates that Atea was created as an initially female divinity by → Tangaroa. Athená (or Athéne) Virgin tutelary goddess of Athens and Greek goddess of wisdom. Originally a Cretan-Minoan palace goddess, perhaps identical with a Cretan snake-goddess: the snake continued Athená 23"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"into later times to be associated with her (picture in the Parthenon). Her epithet glaukopis ( \u0001 owl-eyed) hints at an ear- lier version in the shape of a bird. In Homer, Athena appears in two forms: as Promachos (‘champion’) she is goddess of battle and bearer of the terrible aegis (the breastplate with the head of Medusa); and as Ergane (‘Craftsman’) she acts as instructor in the handicrafts. In her capa- city as a protective deity she bears the epi- thet Pallas; and the palladion , the icon named after her, was supposed to protect the city and its houses from harm. Regarding her birth, the myth tells how she sprang from the head of her father → Zeus. She forms no amorous attachment of any kind, and remains Parthenos – the virgin. The tale is told of how the gods competed with each other to see which of them could provide the most noble gift: Athená won the competition by giving Attica the olive-tree. But that was not all: she gave the peasant his plough, to women she gave the loom and she invented the flute. Thus, along with her role as goddess of war she is also a goddess of peace. The Romans equated her with → Minerva. Atirat A West-Semitic goddess, described by the Babylonian king Hammurabi as ‘daughter-in-law of the king of heaven’ and ‘queen of lascivious- ness’. The name derives either from atir \u0001 friend, or from an Arabic word mean- ing ‘brilliance, brightness’; if the latter derivation is correct, this would seem to point to a solar connection. In South Arabia, Atirat appears in association with the moon-god → Amm. Átlas (‘the bearer’) Son of the Titan → Iapetós and the Oceanid Klymene; sen- tenced to carry the vault of heaven because he took part in the campaign against the gods. The equation with the mountain range in North Africa was known in antiquity; for example, it is to be found in Herodotus. Atlaua Old Mexican water-god (Nahuatl atl \u0001 water) who is also associ- ated with the ‘arrow’ ( atlatl ). He is ‘Master of the waters’. When he takes his arrow in his hand, he will soar up like the Quetzal bird. Aton In Ancient Egypt, primarily the designation of the visible disc of the sun, which was regarded as a manifestation of → Re. In the New Kingdom, the sun-disc was personified and under King Amenophis IV, who called himself Echnaton (i.e. ‘he pleases Aton’), it was declared to be the one true god. Portrayals from this period show the sun-disc, whose rays are arms which end in hands bearing the loop of life. The monotheism associ- ated with Aton was abandoned after the death of Echnaton. Atri One of the deified bards, singers of sacred songs ( → Ri s is) in ancient India. His name, ‘the devouring one’, was 24 Atirat"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"an epithet of fire.

Átropos → Moires ’Attar A god worshipped in South Arabia BC. In invocations of the divine trinity he takes pride of place. The planet Venus is allotted to him (the morning star); and he is a god of war and of pro- tection in war, with the epithet ‘he who is bold in battle’. In addition, he is the giver of water, vital for life, a function in which his services overlap those of the moon- god. The antelope is sacred to him, and one of his symbols is the spear-point. Outside South Arabia, ’Attar may assume androgynous traits (as in Ugarit). Attis Phrygian god of vegetation, lover of the Great Mother ( → Kybéle). In an older version of the myth he is a beautiful youth who is killed by a boar while hunt- ing. The later version is the better known: according to it, Attis loses his reason in his desperate passion for Kybéle, and emasculates himself under a pine-tree. Spring flowers and trees grow up from the blood of the dying youth. Attis mystery rites with sacramental partaking of food and taurobolium (baptism with bull’s blood) were widespread throughout the Roman Empire. At the end of March the feast of the dying and resurrected god (symbolized by a pine-tree) was solemnized. Atum Ancient Egyptian primeval god and creator of the world, venerated espe- cially in Heliopolis. His name is construed as meaning ‘he who is not yet completed’, or perhaps ‘the nonexistent’. Before heaven and earth became separated he was the ‘one lord’. In the Pyramid texts he appears as the primeval mountain, that is, the first substance to arise from primeval chaos. He may take the form of the scarab, the snake or (later) the ichneumon. Atum begat the first divine couple → M u (breath of wind) and → Tefnut (humidity). In accordance with the solar syncretism of the Egyptians, Atum and → Re could be equated. Atunis The Etruscan name of → Adonis, taken over by the Etruscans from the Greek pantheon in the fourth century BC. Represented only on mirrors, usually in association with → Turan; the two together corresponding to the Oriental- Mediterranean pair of the Great Mother and her son. Aufaniae Celtic deities, known from votive inscriptions found in the Rhineland and in Spain. They seem to be matron-like figures. Auróra For the Romans, the morning red and the goddess who raises it in the sky; cf. → Eos in Greece. Auseklis (Latvian \u0001 morning star) A Baltic stellar god, subordinate to the moon but often represented as serving the sun. When marriages are held in heaven he forms part of the bridal cortege, and he is a willing helper in the heavenly bath- house. As a place associated with birth and with curative properties, the bath- house was particularly strongly endowed with vital forces. Auxo → Horae Avalokite q vara (also Avalokita or Loke f vara) In Buddhism, the most popular of all the → Bodhisattvas. He is regarded as an emanation of → Amit a bha, and as the so-called → Dhy a ni- Bodhisattva of the present age.

He is an embodiment of compassion, a main virtue in Buddhism. Out of compassion he descends to hell in order to redeem the souls who suffer there. Iconographically he is depicted in many ways. Usually he has two arms, but in the Tantric tradition he has four or six arms. One of his most signifi- cant attributes is the wreath of roses; another is the moon ( → Amoghap af a, → Khasarpana). In his plaited crown he bears the portrait of Amit a bha. When he is shown with ten or eleven faces, this is with reference to his universality. One of his most popular representations is as Cint a ma j icakra-Avalokite f vara: that is, he bears as attributes a jewel ( cint a ma j i ) held before the breast, and a wheel ( cakra ). In China he has been transformed into the female deity → Guan Yin. In Japan he is known as K(w)annon and in Tibet as sPyan-ras-gzigs, as an incarnation of whom the Dalai Lama is regarded. Awonawilona Creation god of the Zuñi (one of the Pueblo Indian tribes). He is the origin of all life; his epithet ‘He- she’ shows that he is held to be hermaph- rodite. He created heaven/father and earth/mother by throwing balls of his skin on the primeval waters. Ayiyanayaka (also Ayiyan) A kind- hearted tutelary god of woodland and countryside venerated by the Dravidians and the Singhalese, the protecting deity of the northern part of the island of Ceylon (Sri Lanka). According to one myth he was born as a golden statue from the right hand of → Vi sj u. The god is still invoked today to protect crops and when there is danger of plague. Ays Among the Armenians this word means not only ‘wind’ but also the evil spirit which rushes along in the wind: it can penetrate into human beings and drive them crazy. A z i Dahaka (Avestan aˇ zi \u0001 snake, cf. Modern Farsi aˇ zidah a \u0001 dragon) A mythical figure which reaches back into the very earliest Indo-Aryan times. It was a snake-like monster with three heads, initially preying on cattle and an enemy of all good men. Subsequently it was seen as the usurper of the Iranian king- dom and the embodiment of falsehood. Temporarily conquered, he will present himself as a threat once more at the end of time as an accomplice of → Ahriman, but then he will be defeated once and for all. Azizos and Monimos It is under these names that the morning star and the evening star were venerated in Syria; they were depicted as two boys with an eagle.

In the Late Egyptian period, the god assumes the form of a billy-goat. Ba (2) (pl: Baw) Ancient Egyptian des- ignation for a spiritual power which Horapollon identifies with Psyche. In the oldest religious texts, anonymous gods who make occasional appearances are written with the signs for Ba; and later the word becomes a synonym for the mani- fested form of a god. The Apis bull is the Ba of → Osiris, the star Sirius (Egyptian Sothis) is the Ba of → Isis, and the Pharaoh is seen as the ‘living soul’ of the sun-god → Re. Ba (3) Chinese goddess, a personifica- tion of drought. In some literary sources she is referred to as the daughter of the mythical Emperor → Huang-di. Baal Storm-god and god of fecundity of the West Semites, represented both in human shape and as a bull. The word ba’l means ‘owner, lord’ and can be a generic term for gods in general. Thus, it is applied to various local deities, as, for example, Baal-Sidon or Baal-Lebanon; the Baal of Tyros was known as → Melqart. → Baal-Hadad occupied a cen- tral position in Syria as a whole. Belief in Baal came with the Hyksos to Egypt, where the god is specifically depicted as wearing a conical cap with a long band and bull’s horns. Soon afterwards, Baal was identified with → Seth. Baal-Addir (‘mighty Baal’) Initially the god of the Phoenician town of Byblos, whence his cult spread to Punic (Carthaginian) Africa, whether as a god of fertility or of the underworld is a moot point. Among African troops in the Roman army he was identified with Jupiter Valens. Baal-Biq’ a h As ‘lord of the plain’ (between the Lebanon and the Anti- Lebanon) this was the deity after whom the town of Baalbek was named. Initially a weather-god (like → BaalHadad) he became in the Hellenistic period a sky- or sun-god, and was identified with Zeus.

His symbol was the bull, the emblem of fertil- ity. According to Ugaritic texts, Baal dwelt on the Sapan mountain and hence is also known as Baal Sapan. His chief ene- mies are → Jamm (sea) and → Mot (death). A stele at Ras Shamra shows the gods bearing in his hands a club and the symbol of lightning. Baal-Hamon The earliest known ref- erence to this god occurs in an inscription found at the Phoenician settlement of Zindsirli. The name is taken to mean ‘lord of the censer altars’. He is known chiefly as the supreme god of Carthage, whence he was introduced to Malta, Sicily and Sardinia. In North Africa, he was revered mainly as a god of fertility, a role attested in the epithet given him in Roman times – Frugifer (‘fruit-bearer’). The sacrifice of children played a part in his cult obser- vances, both in Sicily and in North Africa. Owing to the similarity between his name and that of the oasis god → Ammon, he was also regarded as an oracular god. The Greeks identified him with → Kronos, the Romans with → Saturnus. Baal-Karmelos (‘lord of Kamid’) A Canaanite god revered on Mount Carmel. In I Kings: 18, 19 ff. it is related how the prophet Elijah challenged the priests of Baal to conjure up a burnt sacrifice with- out fire.

Bacax A deity revered by the ancient Berbers; he was supposed to dwell in a cave at the entrance of which sacrificial offerings were to be made. Bácchus was implanted in Rome at a compara- tively early date. It was a secret cult, and its rites, die Bacchanalia, were marked not only by sexual excesses but by crimes of every description, so much so that from time to time the cult was prohibited. The most significant portrayal of Dionysiac mysteries is to be found in Pompeii. Badb (Bodb) Irish goddess of war. The battle-field is called after her ‘land of Badb’.

The ety- mology of his name is not clear, and there are accordingly several different interpre- tations of his function; thus he is vari- ously seen as a god of light and as a god of vegetation – that is, as a god who dies and is resurrected. Again, he has been seen as a hypostatis of the war-god Odin, an interpretation depending on equation of his name with the Old Norse adjective baldr \u0001 courageous, bold.

In Basque tradition he plays the part of a cultural initiator who instructs mankind in the art of agricul- ture, and from whom they copy forging and working in wrought iron. Ba ya mum A god worshipped in ancient south Arabia. His name may come from Arabic baˇ s a m \u0001 balsam bush. This suggests that he was a god of healing, a hypothesis strengthened by the fact that one ancient text relates how he cured two wild goats or ibexes. Bastet An Egyptian goddess, inter- preted as a personification of ointment. At an early period she was visualized in the shape of a lion, and this led to her coales- cence with the leonine → Sachmet. In line with the syncretism typical of Egyptian religion she was seen as the ‘eye of → Re’ and coupled with → Tefnut. From the New Kingdom onwards, Bastet is increas- ingly represented as having the head of a cat. Memphitic tradition makes her the mother of the god of embalming → Anubis. The centre of her cult was 30 Balder"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Bubastis, and hence we find even classical authors calling her Bubastis. Bata Taurine god, tutelary deity of the seventeenth nome of Upper Egypt. He is known from the New Kingdom legend of the two brothers. Baubo partly legendary in nature. Their symbols and attributes are in common use as lucky charms. Their names are: → Cao Guo-jiu, → Han Xiang-zi, → He Xian-gu, → Lan Cai-he, → Li Tie-guai → Lü Dong-bin, → Zhang Guo-lao, and → Zhong-li Quan. Bebellahamon North Arabian (Palmyran) god in whom scholars have seen a variant of the Punic → Baal- Hammon. Beelzebub (Beelzebul) The well- known derivation from ‘baal-zebub’, i.e. lord of the flies, is not proven; it is more probable that the name means ‘Baal the prince’, thus corresponding to the Phoenician concept of the god. He was a tutelary god in the land of the Philistines (II Kings 1: 2). Rabbinical texts inter- preted the name as meaning ‘Lord of the dunghill’; the word zabal \u0001 to dung, is used in rabbinical literature as a synonym for idolatry. In the New Testament, Beelzebub is chief of the demons (Matthew 12: 24–27). Befana In popular belief in north Italy, a female demon of midwinter. She brings presents – but she can also turn nasty and may turn up as a ghost. In some ways she reminds us of the → Bercht in German popular belief. The name Sefana (or Befania) comes from Epiphany, the feast of the Magi (6 January). Beg-tse (Tibetan beg-ce \u0001 hidden shirt of mail) God of war in Lamaism. He is clad from head to foot in mail, and he car- ries a garland of human heads and a crown in the shape of a skull. He often appears under the name of ICam-srin. Behanzin A fish-god venerated in Dahomey. Behedti This god, who took the form of a crouching falcon, was venerated in Behedti 31 Initially, a personification, current in Asia Minor, of female fecundity. According to Orphic (Greek) tradition she is an old woman, who makes the grieving → Demeter laugh by showing her her pudenda. The obscene gesture is to be understood as a protective charm against the powers of death. As a demon, Baubo was visualized as headless or with her head placed between her legs. The name has been variously interpreted as meaning ‘belly’, ‘hole’, ‘womb’. Ba Xian (‘The Eight Immortals’) In Chinese popular belief there are many men and women whose way of life sets them far apart from others, so much so that they can lead a happy life on earth which never ends: these are xian . A particularly well known group of xian is formed by the ‘Eight Immortals’ who are partly historical personages,"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"the Egyptian town of Behdet (Edfu). Very early on he became a local form of the great falcon-god → Horus. The proper symbol of the solar deity is the disc of the sun, fitted with a pair of wings. Behedti also takes over the role of the king identi- fied with Horus. From the Middle Kingdom onwards, the sun-disc became a widespread symbol of protection. Behemoth (Hebrew behema \u0001 animal) A designation of the hippopotamus (Job 40). In Jewish eschatology it figures as an apocalyptic beast; and in the Christian Middle Ages it was identified with → Satan, and patristic authority was invoked to prove it. Perhaps we may also see a relic of Behemoth in the allegedly secret figure of Baphomet, whose symbolic presence the Knights Templar are said to have venerated and kissed upon entry to the Order. If this is indeed so, then the name does service here as a cover-name for the true God. Beh e r Ethiopic sea-god, often named in conjunction with → Astar. Bel (1) This Akkadian word means ‘Master’ and is a component in more than one divine name. In later times, the word Bel came to be used for the god → Marduk, and this applies to the Biblical passages involving his name as well (e.g. Jeremiah 46: 1; Daniel 14: 3). In a Greek version of the Babylonian creation myth he is called Belos. Bel (2) The supreme god of Palmyra, whose name was originally Bol (from Semitic Baal?); Bol seems to have turned into Bel ( → Bel) under Babylonian influ- ence. He was a sky-god and his attributes included lightning flashes and an eagle. He formed a trinity along with the moon-god ( → Aglibol) and the sun-god ( → Yarhibol). Belenus A Celtic god revered espe- cially in the eastern Alpine area, though his cult extended into north Italy and south Gaul. The root bel -probably means ‘shine’, which would suggest that Belenus was a god of light. In Aquileia, the god was presented as → Apollon. B e lets e ri A Babylonian goddess who figures as ‘book-keeper’ and ‘clerk’ of the underworld. As the underworld is circum- scribed as ‘steppe’, she is also known by the epithet ‘Queen of the steppe’. She is the spouse of the nomad god → Martu. Belial Also Beliar (‘the unholy one’, ‘the worthless one’). Wicked men are specifically described in the Old Testament as ‘men of Belial’ (2 Samuel 16: 7). In Psalm 18: 5 the word is used in the phrase ‘floods of ungodly men’ ( nachalei belial ), usually rendered in Catholic Bible transla- tions as ‘streams of the devil’. Satan, the devil, is clearly intended in the reference in 2 Corinthians 6: 15, and similarly in pas- sages in the Qumran texts: Belial is the spirit (and the prince) of darkness. Belili Old Mesopotamian goddess, probably a denizen of the underworld. She was a sister of the god of vegetation → Dumuzi. Several attempts have been made to derive the Biblical figure of → Belial from her. Bellona (1) Cappadocian goddess (Asia Minor) who was given a role in the retinue of the Mother Goddess ( → Kybéle). Bellóna (2) Roman goddess of war: more precisely, a personification of war. Her name comes from the Latin bellum \u0001 war. On occasion she figures as the spouse of → Mars. Bendis Virgin, arms-bearing goddess of the Thracians; equated by the Greeks with → Artemis, sometimes with → Hekáte. Her cult was introduced into Athens in the time of Pericles. 32 Behemoth"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Beng A gipsy name for the devil. He often engages God in a trial of strength, but is always beaten. He dwells in the woods and prefers to go about his shady business by night. Benten some Alpine districts it is customary to place food for her on the roof on Perchtentag (Epiphany). The → Perchten are called after her. Berekyndai In Phrygia, the divine attendants of the Magna Mater ( → Kybéle). Bes Beset 33 In Japan, the Buddhist goddess of elo- quence and music, patron saint of the geishas, and reckoned as one of the seven → Shichi-Fukujin, the gods of good luck. She is represented wearing a jewelled diadem and holding in her hands a stringed instrument. Her name is some- times written as Benzaiten. Bercht Perchta is an alternative form, and she is also called Frau Berta or Eisenberta. As a midwinter spirit she goes back to pre-Christian times in Germany; but with the coming of Christianity she became the personification of the night preceding Epiphany (6 January) called perahtun naht in Old High German. She appears in various guises: as Butzenbercht, the bringer of gifts, as ‘Spinnstubenfrau’ (spinning-room woman) who visits houses by night, and then again as ‘stomach- slasher’, ‘bogey-woman’. Traces of the cult once surrounding her still survive: thus, in In ancient Egypt, a half-demonic half- divine figure which occurs also in the plu- ral. The Bes has a grotesque face and a dwarfish body. To begin with, he carried a lion-skin on his back, of which only the ears and the tail survived into later times. His most important attributes are the Sanoose (a symbol of protection), knives as defensive weapons and musical instru- ments whose sounds scare off evil spirits. Beset A female → Bes, belief in whom was particularly widespread in the time of the Ptolemies. The lion’s tail is missing from her attributes; instead, she has a crown of feathers. Like Bes, her function is apotropaic."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Bestla In the Edda, the daughter of the giant Bolthorn, and the mother of the god → Odin. Her name is interpreted as mean- ing ‘giver of bast’, which would identify her as a goddess of the yew tree; alterna- tively as ‘tree-bark’, a reading which would made Odin a god born from a tree. Bethel The word really means ‘the house of God’, but it is found as a divine name in Canaan. There is an identical place-name in the Old Testament (Genesis 31: 13) which has certainly nothing to do with the non-Biblical god. On the other hand, the reference in Jeremiah 48: 13 is probably to the god Bethel. Bhaga (Sanskrit ‘dispenser’; Iranian baga \u0001 god) In the Vedic religion, one of the → Adityas. He is invoked as a giver of good fortune and prosperity, and in addition he is the god of marriage, to whom the month of spring is dedicated. Bhagav a n (Bhagw a n: Sanskrit \u0001 the exalted one, the sublime one) In the Indian Bhagavata sect a designation for the supreme god, later identified with the god → Vi sj u and with his incarnation → Kri sj a. Certain aboriginal tribes in India, like the Bhil, have taken over the Sanskrit word → Bhagw a n, as the name of their highest god. Bhagw a n Supreme god of the Bhil people (in north-west Central India). Bhagwan was originally alone, but then he created the other gods and made them bearers of light. He is known by other names such as Parmesar (‘the highest’) and Andate (‘Giver of corn’). He is also judge of the dead. Bhairava (Sanskrit \u0001 the terrible one) This Indian god is regarded as an emana- tion of → F iva having been born from the space between F iva’s eyebrows. He is endowed with four or six arms and a fierce visage with protruding canine teeth; he is festooned with snakes, and he carries a garland of skulls and a bowl full of blood. His sacred animal is the dog, and he often rides on one. Bhairava is regarded as a heavenly watchman, and it is customary to offer him small figures of dogs made out of sugar. Bhai s ajyaguru (‘Master of medicine’) A → Buddha of the healer’s art, who makes his appearance as early as the fourth century AD. He is probably a deifi- cation of → Gautama Buddha in his capacity as medicine-man. His paradise lies in the east and is floored with lapis lazuli. In China he is called Yao-xi, in Japan Yaku-shi. He is usually shown hold- ing in his right hand the bitter medicinal fruit of die myrobalan. Bhavanav a sin One of the four main categories of gods in Jainism; they dwell in the upper regions of the underworld, in a place ‘gleaming with jewels’. Bh i ma (Sanskrit \u0001 the terrible one) Several aboriginal Indian tribes have taken this name from Hindu mythology to designate a god who seems to be associ- ated with sky and weather. Bh r kuti A female deity in the Buddhist pantheon. She has one head and four arms, she is yellow in colour and young. With her right hands she makes the gesture signifying that a wish has been granted, and holds a garland of roses; in her left hands she holds her attributes – the triple staff (the three staves bound together which a Brahman could carry to show he had renounced the world) and a waterpot. She is located on the moon and bears on her head the like- ness of → Amit a bha.

He has one head and four arms; he is of dire appearance, and his three eyes are underlined in red. He is black in hue, but that does not prevent him from shining like a thousand suns.

Bh u tas In India, a designation for demons who can assume the most var- ied assortment of shapes – horses, pigs, giants, etc. Bia A child of the queen of the Greek underworld, → Styx, and the constant companion of → Zeus. His name ( bia \u0001 power, strength) suggests that he may be no more than a hypostatization of the father of the gods. Biegg-Olmai → Olmai Bilwis (Middle High German pilwiz ) In the earliest references to him, in texts from Bavaria and Austria, he appears as a nature spirit who uses a sort of missile to cure illnesses. At the end of the Middle Ages, however, there is a switch in mean- ing, and the erstwhile demonic creature turns into a magician, or even a female witch. Bilwis is also known in east Germany, where he appears as a man endowed with demonic powers and with sickles attached to his feet; at night he cuts narrow strips into corn-fields (hence ‘Bilmesschneider’, Bilmes-cutter), or chooses some other way to rob the farmer of part of his crops. Today, in popular belief, he is little more than a bogeyman. Binbeal → Bunjil Bisham → Shichi-Fukujin Bochica Culture-hero of the Muisca Indians in Colombia. He gave his people laws and taught them handicrafts. His figure finally coalesced with that of the sun-god. Bodhisattva In Buddhism a being ( sattva ) intent on achieving enlighten- ment ( bodhi ). The Chinese term is Pu-sa, the Japanese Bo-satsu. Bodhisattva is the → Buddha to be, whose compassion for humanity is so great that at times he renounces achievement of Buddhahood. Originally, this was taken to mean no more than the historical Buddha before his enlightenment, but in die sequel the number of Bodhisattvas became infinite thanks to the concept of ‘future Buddhas’. They are heavenly beings who bring sal- vation (for example → Avalokite f vara, and → Mañju f r i ), who are worshipped in ceremonial ritual and who are invoked in any and every case of need or distress. The eight ‘great Bodhisattvas’ are called Mah a bodhisattvas. Iconographically the Bodhisattvas are shown robed as princes and bearing a five-leaved crown. Boldogasszony (also known as Kis- boldogasszony or Nagyboldogasszony) Virgin goddess of the ancient Hungarians, ‘the great and rich queen’ whose milk is holy. She is the protector of mother and child. With the coming of Christianity, she was transformed into the figure of the Virgin Mary as the ‘divine princess’, the ‘queen’, the mother of the Hungarian people. Bolla A demonic snake-like being in Albanian popular belief; called Bullar in South Albania. It is only on St George’s day that it opens its eyes, and if it should then see a human being it will devour him. After twelve years the Bulla turns into the fearsome → Kulshedra.

Boréas In Greek mythology, the per- sonification of the harsh north wind. He surprises Oreithyia, the daughter of the King of Athens, at play and abducts her to his homeland in Thrace. When a Persian war fleet was decimated in a violent storm, Boréas achieved cult status in Athens and was duly worshipped. Borvo A Gallic god. The root of his name ( bor ) is supposed to signify ‘boil’, ‘bubble’, and the god himself is associ- ated with curative mineral springs. Bragi (Old Icelandic bragr \u0001 the most distinguished) North German god of the art of poetry. He is first mentioned in late texts, and this has prompted the sus- picion that he is in fact an historically attested Skald of the same name, who was subsequently promoted to mythological status. No cult seems to have been attached to his name; → Idun is men- tioned as his wife. Brahm a This is properly the masculine form of the Sanskrit word brahman , and it designates the personification of → Brahman in Indian religion. Originally, Brahm a was regarded as the head of the → Trim u rti: he was creator and director of the world, and he was the supreme god of the Devadeva (the gods). He was pictured with four heads and in his four hands he holds the four Vedas, the holy scriptures of ancient India. Among his other attrib- utes are a vessel containing water from the Ganges, and a garland of roses; he rides on a Hamsa (i.e. a goose) which becomes, by poetic licence, a swan. His spouse is → Sarasvat i . In recent times, the figure of Brahm a has lost much of its for- mer prestige. He is now god of wisdom and progenitor of the Brahmins. An epi- thet used frequently in connection with him is Kamal a sana – ‘he who sits on the lotus’. Brahman (Sanskrit neuter noun) Originally this word designated the Vedic magic incantation or sacred formula; then it came to mean the power inherent in the utterance, the power which enables the gods to perform their mythic functions and which enables the Vedic priests (Brahmans) to undertake the sacred rites. Finally, in the Upani s ads, this holy power becomes the omnipotent, indeed the cre- ative principle, the original cosmic ground, the world-soul. One text describes Brahman as the ‘wood’ from which heaven and earth are built. In the F atapatha-Br a hma j a, Brahman is con- strued as a personal and supernatural being. Bress Irish god of fertility. According to the myth, he is a son of the King of Fomore, but is adopted by the → Tuatha De Danann.

B r haspati (also found as Brahma j aspati \u0001 Lord of prayer) Vedic god, who for- wards the prayers of human beings to the gods. He is ‘born from the great light in the highest heaven’ and he drives dark- ness away with roars from his sevenfold mouth. In Vedic mythology he appears as the protector of cows, and as the regent of the planet Jupiter; in this latter capacity he is pictured as golden-yellow and bear- ing a staff, a garland of prayers (a prayer- ring) and a water-pot. Brigantia A goddess (of victory?) known from inscriptions found in Britain. Her name is derived from the Celtic word brig ( \u0001 hill, height), which is also the root of the name of the Brigantes, who lived in what is now Wales. The goddess may be connected with the Irish → Brigit, but this is not certain. Brigit (Irish brig \u0001 power, authority) Daughter of the god → Dagda, and patroness of smiths, poets and doctors. She was associated with the ritual fires of purification, and the feast of Imbolc , on 1 February, was in her honour. Later, she was taken over by Christian hagio-graphy and was venerated in Kildare as the holy Brigit, who was supposed to tend the holy fire along with 19 nuns. Britómartis A virgin goddess peculiar to Crete, who later on merged with the figure of → Artemis. The pre-Greek name was interpreted in late classical times as meaning something like ‘sweet virgin’. Buchis The holy bull venerated in the ancient Egyptian town of Hermonthis, near Thebes. He was supposed to be the ‘living image’ of the god → Month, though he also figured as the herald of the sun-god → Re. His brood-cows were regarded as holy in their capacity of ‘those who gave birth to Re’. The bull was characterized by a white body and a black head. Buddha Buddha 37 (Sanskrit ‘the awakened one’, ‘the enlightened one’) The designation of one who has attained illumination or enlightenment (bodhi), the highest aim in Buddhism. The Buddha can be recog- nized by 32 cardinal and 80 secondary bodily characteristics: e.g. on the sole of each foot is a wheel with a thousand spokes. The most important Buddha is the historical one ( → Gautama Buddha). Three or six Buddhas are supposed to have lived before him, and he will be fol- lowed by the fifth Buddha ( → Maitreya).

Bukura e dheut (‘the beauty of the earth’) Old fairy-like creature in Albanian folklore and folk-tale. She is always ready to help, and so powerful that she can undertake tasks that would nor- mally be the province of God or of an angel. Her castle is guarded by all sorts of weird and wonderful creatures. She often develops a demonic dimension and is then in touch with the underworld. Bukuri i qiellit (‘the beautiful one in heaven’) A designation for God which is current in Christian circles in Albania. It goes back to ancient Illyrian times, when three gods divided themselves into heaven, ocean and underworld. Bulaing Female divinity of creation in the religion of the Australian Karadjeri. She is an immortal being living in heaven, who has created all things and all crea- tures. The word bulaing is also used to denote the mythical serpents. Buluga (also Puluga) The supreme god of the Negritos on the Andaman Islands. He is regarded as immortal, omniscient and invisible, he has created the world and mankind, and sees to it that his commandments are obeyed. His female counterpart, the supreme being of female sex, lives in the northern part of the archipelago; she is called Biliku. The wind is supposed to be Buluga’s breath, and his voice is heard in the thunder. Bumba Supreme being, creator and progenitor of the Boshongo, a Bantu tribe in Africa. In the beginning, he was alone; there was then nothing except darkness and water. Then Bumba was smitten by agonizing stomach pains, and he spat out the sun, the moon and, finally, living creatures. Mankind came last of all. Bunjil ( Bundjil \u0001 falcon) The supreme being of the Australian Kulin. This being formed the first humans, and it blew its breath into their mouths until they began to stir. It is not usual to refer to this being by name; usually it is called ‘our father’. Its son is Binbeal, the rain- bow. In the Karnai tribe, only initiates know of Bunjil’s existence. Bur(i) A mythical primeval being in the religious system of the Germanic tribes. He was the first man and the pro- genitor of the gods. He came forth from a salty block of ice when the primeval cow Audhumla licked it. His son is → Bor.

He was the first being, at whose command all things arose. He created the animals to serve man. Cai-Shen The Chinese god of riches. He has been identified at different times with various historical personalities. He is said to have been a hermit endowed with supernatural powers; thus he was able to ride on a black tiger. Cakravartin (‘he who turns the wheel’) An appellation for a world ruler in Indian Buddhism. His birth and his youthful years are closely similar to those of a → Buddha, and like a Buddha he has 32 car- dinal characteristics on his body. He is the lord of the wheel ( cakra ) which symbol- izes the Teaching. A Cakravartin can only be born when there is no Buddha on the earth. According to Jainist teach- ing, a Cakravartin has 14 ‘jewels’ ( ratna ): first and foremost a wheel, then a fell (pelt), a staff, a sunshade, a jewel, a conch, a woman, a sword, a general, a house- father, a master-builder, a priest, a steed and an elephant. Camaxtli Tribal god of the Chichimec. Originally an astral god, he became the Aztec god of hunting and of fate; on his body he bore the signs of the twenty days. In addition, he is the leader of warriors slain in battle or offered in human sacri- fice, whose souls become stars in the eastern sky. C a mund a Hindu goddess, a manifes- tation of the terrible → Durg a . Her name seems to be derived from the names of two demons Canda and Munda, whom she is supposed to have slain.

Caturmah a r a jas (Chinese tian wang ) In Buddhist cosmogony these are the four great kings who guard and control the four quarters of the world; they correspond to the → Lokap a las of Hinduism. They are enthroned on the invisible and holy world-mountain of Meru, whence they extend their protection to Buddhist truth ( dharma ) in all parts of the world. To begin with, they are regarded as benevolent beings, but with the rise of Tantrism they turn into warlike and menacing figures who inspire fear. The North is guarded by → Va i f ravana, the West by the red → Vir u p a k s a, the South by → Vir u dhaka, and the East by → Dh r tar ast ra. Cautes and Cautopates Companions of the god → Mithra, particularly associ- ated with him in the ritual slaughter of a bull. One has a raised, the other a lowered torch; and this has led scholars to see in them representatives of day and night, the onset of spring and of autumn, life and death. The etymology of the names is unclear. Centaurs 40 Cao Dai Fabulous creatures in Greek mythology; wild and half-animal, they had a human torso and the body of a horse.

Like the Greek → Demeter, she was also a goddess of fertility and of marriage: Her temple on the Aventine Hill was a central point for the plebs, the common people. Her feast, the Cerealia, was celebrated on 19 April. Ceres Africana A North African god- dess of the harvest, mentioned by Tertullian. She is also known as Ceres Punica. The Latin name hides an autochthonous fertility goddess. Cernunnos the underworld. In a few cases he is por- trayed with coins. Cernunnos may in fact be a pre-Celtic god (game preservation?). Cghene Supreme being in the reli- gious belief of the Isoko in south Nigeria.

As a trinity, the Graces appear first in Hesiod, where they are named: Aglaia (splendour), Euphrosine (cheerfulness) and Thaleia (blossom). In mythology and in art they appear in the retinue of → Aphrodíte or of → Apóllon, and bring beauty and pleasure to mankind. The → Horai are closely associ- ated with them. The → Gratiae corre- spond to the Charites in the Roman pantheon. Cháron In Greek mythology the ferry- man who rows the dead over the border river (Acheron, Styx) to the underworld, Cháron 41 A Celtic god who sits in the so-called Buddha attitude, his head adorned with a set of antlers. He is thus portrayed on the Gundestrup cauldron. His name has been taken to mean ‘the horned one’. He seems to have been mainly concerned with fertility and with wealth, though he also seems to have been associated with"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"and delivers them at the entrance to Hades. He is paid by putting a coin ( obolos ) in the mouth of the dead person. Originally, Charon was a demon of death in the shape of a dog. He persists in mod- ern Greek folklore as Charos, only now he rides a black horse which sweeps the dead along with it by means of its wooden saddle. Charontes Male and female demons of death in the Etruscan religion; they are most frequently shown bearing hammers. The name is derived from → Charun. Charun A male demon in the under- world of the Etruscans. His attribute is a hammer which he carries on his shoul- der, or on which he supports himself. He has a nose like a vulture’s, pointed animal ears and, often, snakes growing on his head instead of hair. Frequently he is shown with wings. Charun escorts the dead, and watches over the portals of graves. His name is connected with that of the Greek → Charon. Chasca Coyllur In pre-Columbian Peru, the god of flowers and protector of maidens. Cheíron (Chiron, Greek cheir \u0001 hand) Originally a Thessalian god of the art of healing. He owes his name to his skill with his hands. In Greek mythology he is the son of → Kronos, a wise → Centaur, well-disposed towards men, who instructs → Asklepiós in the curative skills. In his cave on Mount Pelion he reared many famous heroes (Achilles, for example) until finally he was struck by a poisoned arrow fired by → Herakles, and voluntar- ily renounced his immortality in favour of → Prometheus. Cheng-huang This Chinese designa- tion was originally applied to chthonic gods and subsequently transferred to local gods, tutelary deities who are responsible for a district and its inhabi- tants. The Cheng-huang are terrestrial gods in that they supervise districts, look after law and order and ward off danger. Chensit Goddess of the twentieth nome of Lower Egypt, who took the form of the uraeus snake and was then associ- ated with the tutelary deity → Sopdu. She may be portrayed bearing either the crown of → Hathor or the feather of → Maat, or both. Chentechtai This is the Grecianized form of the Egyptian appellation Chenti- cheti. To begin with, he was a crocodile god but soon took on the form of a falcon; he is also connected with → Kemwer, the black bull of Athribis. Finally he con- verges with → Osiris, so much so that he is referred to as ‘Osiris who dwells in Athribis’. Chenti-irti (Machenti-irti) A falcon- god venerated in the Egyptian city of Letopolis, who was identified with → Horus as far back as the Old Kingdom. His main characteristic is that, in corre- spondence with the myth of the lost lunar or solar eye, he is conceived as having no eyes. As a judge, he looks after law and order. Chepre (Chepri) The appellation given to the scarab, the dung-beetle worshipped in Heliopolis in its aspect as primeval god. The scarab is then ‘he who arose from himself ’, who came forth from the earth without any generative process. Very early on, he was taken as a manifes- tation of → Atum, and finally equated with → Re. The sun-god arises as Chepre, newly born from the underworld, and makes his appearance in the heavens. As a primeval god, Chepre can assume the shape of a snake; in human shape he is portrayed as bearing a scarab on his head. 42 Charontes"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Cherti A ram-god often mentioned on early Egyptian steles, who was venerated especially in the area of the town of Letopolis. In the Pyramid texts he is allot- ted the specific function of ferryman in the realm of the dead. Cherubim (Kerubim, connected with the Assyrian word karibu ) Hybrid crea- tures, half-animal half-human, who appear in the Old Testament. They are presented as guardians of the sacral points round which Jewish life and belief centre: the Tree of Life, the Ark of the Covenant, the temple; and they indicate the presence of God. In the vision of Ezekiel they form the living chariot of → Jahwe (Ezekiel 1: 5 f.) In the book of Revelations they are described as ‘beasts’ and they stand around the throne of God (Revelation 4: 6 ff.) They are ‘full of eyes before and behind’ and this identifies them as cosmic beings, the eyes symbolizing the stars. According to a Christian interpretation which goes back to Dionysius Areopagita, the Cherubim are a particular class of angels. Cherufe A gigantic fabulous creature which eats men in the folk-lore of the Araucanian Indians who live in Chile and Argentina. It lives in volcanoes and feeds on young girls. Chia Appellation of the moon, and the name of the moon-goddess of the Muisca Indians who live in what is today Colombia; she is also their progenitor. The ruler of Muikita (known under the name of Zipa) is regarded as the terres- trial representative of the moon. Chicome coatl (‘Seven snakes’) Aztec goddess of foodstuffs; in particular, the giver of maize. Among her attributes are the maize cob and the ceremonial rattle (cf. → Chalchihuitlicue). Chímaira (Greek \u0001 goat) A fabulous monster in Greek mythology: it has a lion’s forequarters, the body is that of a goat (with a goat’s head) and the tail is replaced by a snake. Homer tells us that the Chimaira is native to the coast of Lycia, and it is possible that it was originally Chímaira 43"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"a demon symbolizing the Lycian ‘earth- fire’. According to Vergil it lives at the entrance to the underworld. The monster was slain by the hero Bellerophon. Chinna-mast a (‘whose head is cut off ’: occurs also in the form Chinnamastak a ) A terrifying goddess in Tantrism; she holds her own head in one hand, and the head’s mouth opens to receive the blood that spurts from the gaping neck. The goddess is worshipped mainly in Bengal. Chnubis In Roman times a god com- bining Greek and Egyptian characteris- tics. He appears as → Agathós Daímon, and as a gnostic → Aión, and is portrayed as a snake with a lion’s head which is usu- ally surrounded by a halo of rays. Some connection between Chnubis and → Chnum is possible but not certain. Chnum aligned on each side. At Elephantine, Chnum was regarded as guardian of the source of the Nile and hence was donator of the life-giving waters. His main func- tion is a creative one: he fashions the bod- ies of children on a potter’s wheel and then introduces them into the mother’s womb. Hence his epithet: ‘the sculptor who gives life’. In the Hellenistic age, he played the part of a god of revelations, and he appears in the literature of necromancy as Haruer- Chnuph – i.e. as a variant of → Haroeris. Chons Egyptian moon-god, son of → Amun and of → Mut, with whom he forms the triad of Thebes. His name means ‘he who fares through (the heavens)’ – a refer- ence to his lunar character. As ‘Lord of time’ he converges with → Thot, whose ibis head he sometimes adopts. He is usually represented as a young man in mummy posture with his legs close together, and with the crescent moon and the full moon on his head. In Thebes, Chons was equated with → M u, and was regarded as bearer of heaven. One of his epithets is ‘he who gives advice’ (Greek Chespisichis). As Chons-Re he was seen as a form of the youthful sun- god, to whom one turned for protection against wild animals. Chontamenti (Chonti-amentiu) Egyptian god of the dead. His name means ‘he who is in the uttermost west’: it is in the west that the sun goes down, and there too is the kingdom of the dead. The god is represented as a crouching dog or jackal. In the Pyramid texts we find a king wish- ing to be changed into Chontamenti so that he may be able to rule over the dead. Chors A god of the eastern Slavs, known from his being mentioned in the so-called Nestor Chronicle along with other sources. He was probably a sun- god. The etymology of the name is not clear. He seems to have been a sort of hybrid with a dog’s head and horns. 44 Chinna-mast a (Chnumu) An Egyptian god in the shape of a ram; the name itself denotes a ram. He is portrayed as a man with a ram’s head, the horns being horizontally"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Chronos Personification of time, often coincident in the late classical period with the figure of → Aión. His portrayal as a bearded old man with sickle and hour- glass was particularly popular in the Renaissance and the Baroque periods. Cihuacoatl (‘female snake’) An earth- and mother-goddess venerated in the town of Colhuacan, often shown with a child in her arms. She it was who helped → Quetzalcoatl when the first man was being created. Sometimes she coincides with the figure of → Teteo. Cinteotl (Centeotl) Aztec god of maize, the most important plant in ancient Mexico. Cinteotl represents a specific aspect of → Quetzalcoatl. Citipati (‘Lord of the graveyard’) Graveyard demons in Buddhism, espe- cially Tibetan Buddhism. They are repre- sented as two dancing skeletons. Coatlicue (‘she who wears a skirt of snakes’) Aztec goddess of earth and fire; she also appears as mother of the gods. Her statue in Mexico City shows, apart from the skirt of snakes, a head with two snakes and a necklace consisting of human hands and hearts: the latter in evi- dence of the need for human sacrifice if cosmic order is to be upheld. On her back hang 13 leather cords decorated with snails, symbolizing the mythical heaven. The goddess was made pregnant by a ball of down or an emerald, and gave birth to → Quetzalcoatl. Concordia Roman goddess, personifi- cation of concord. When civil disputes were settled, shrines were dedicated to her. She is portrayed – e.g. on coins – as bear- ing a cornucopia and a sacrificial bowl. Confucius (Latin formation from Chinese Kong-(fu)-zi , ‘Master Kong’) Chinese philosopher. In the year 174 BC one of the Han Emperors made sacrifice to him for the first time at his grave, which is still extant today. Not long after- wards, the first Confucian temple was erected. Finally, in a decree issued in the closing years of the Chinese Empire (in 1906) Confucius was placed on the same footing as the supreme deities of heaven and earth. Tradition has it that at his birth two dragons hovered over the home of his parents. Consus (‘he who gathers in’) Roman god of the safely gathered harvest. He had an underground altar in a circus to the south of the Palatine Hill. By virtue of his chthonic character he was also connected with the dead. Culsu A female demon of the Etruscans, who stands at the portal of the underworld. Her attributes include a burning torch and a pair of scissors (for cutting the thread of life?). Cund a (also Candr a or Cunti) A female deity in Buddhism, an emanation of the Buddha → Vajrasattva, whose image she bears on her crown. She has one face, four arms, and she is white like the moon in autumn. One of her right hands is in the mudr a of donation, and one of her left hands holds a lotus on which a book lies. The other pair of hands are holding a bowl. Curche Old Prussian god of fertility; he was also known as ‘god of food and drink’. Cyclops (Greek Kyklopes \u0001 ‘round eyes’) In Homer, man-eating giants with one single eye in their foreheads. In Hesiod, they are the sons of → Gaia, who forge thunderbolts for → Zeus. Later, they came to be regarded as helpmates of → Hephaistos, and denizens of volcanic areas. Cyclops 45"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"God D No name is known for the Maya god thus designated in specialist litera- ture. He appears as ruler of the night and the moon, and is portrayed as an old man with sunken cheeks. Sometimes he is shown carrying the shell of a sea-snail on his head – a symbol of birth and life. Dabog A south Slavonic sun-god. The root bog can mean both ‘riches’ and ‘god’. In the epic poetry of the Serbians, Dabog appears as ruler over the earth. He is mentioned among the gods, statues to whom were erected in Kiev, and in the ‘Song of Igor’ we are told that the Russians are ‘Dabog’s grandchildren’. Under Christian influence, Dabog was reduced to playing the part of → Satan. The Poles have an equivalent in Dazbog. D a dimunda (or Devat a band a ra) One of the most popular gods of the Singhalese (Sinhala) people. To begin with, he was a god who looked after tem- ples, then he became ‘treasurer’ ( devat a ) of the god → Upulvan, and finally he emerged as protector of Buddhism in Ceylon. He rides on an elephant, and there are many → Ya k s as in his retinue. Da e n a This goddess, the daughter of → Ahura Mazda and of → Armaiti, is the personification of religion in the Old Iranian pantheon. The word da e n a means ‘that which has been revealed’. Da e vas (Daiwa; Middle Persian Dev) An appellation for the gods in the Indo- Aryan period (cf. Sanskrit → Deva, devi). For Zarathustra, the da e vas were, to begin with, simply the ancient gods, who were of no consequence in comparison with → Ahura Mazda; but later he came to regard them as fallen angels or as demons. They are black in colour and are active enemies of the true religion; they eat corpses and torture souls in hell. Dagan D (Hebraized form: Dagon) A west Semitic god of corn. His name means ‘corn’ but was confused by the Israelites with Hebrew dag \u0001 fish – hence the pic- tures of the fish-tailed god. In Ugarit, Dagan was regarded as father of Baal, and in the Old Testament he appears as the chief god of the Philistines (Judges 16: 23ff.). The Canaanites brought his cult to Mesopotamia, where he acquired → M alas as consort; from certain texts we may deduce that he was also equated with → Enlil. Dagan occupied a special position in the religion of the Amorites in Mari. Dagda An Old Irish god whose name means ‘the good god’. He occupies a pre- dominant position in the race of gods known as the → Tuatha De Danann. The"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"epithet associated with him – Ollathir – can be translated as ‘All-father’. He is the god of contracts, and is equipped with three attributes: an enormous club which slays but which can also restore life; a magic harp on which a melody for sleep, a melody for laughter and a melody for woe can be played; and a cooking-pot from which no one is turned away hungry. Daho A Pyrenean deity in Roman times; what we know of his functions makes him comparable with → Mars. Daikoku → Shichi-Fukujin Daimon In the Greek pantheon, the divine instance which allotted us our indi- vidual fate. In Homer, the Olympic gods are called daimones ; but from Hesiod onwards they are understood as beings intermediate between gods and heroes, who may have a beneficent or a malevo- lent influence on human destiny. Popular belief took them as personal guardian spirits. In Greek philosophy, daimonion came to mean the divine spark in man. Under Roman, oriental and early Christian influence, however, demons ended up as sinister and evil spirits. Daityas In Indian belief, demonic ene- mies of the gods. They are the sons of the goddess → Diti banned by → Indra to dwell in the depths of the ocean because of her reluctance to perform sacrifice as due. In later tradition, Prahl a da, who was raised by → Vi sj u to be king of the Daityas, exhibits the characteristics of a wise ascetic. Wa kin i Supernatural beings in Buddhism, who fly in the air. They are invested with specific magical powers, they can initiate novices into the secret learning of the Tantra, and they can be of assistance to a Yogin who wishes to fur- ther his spiritual insight. They appear as young girls hideously disguised or with the head of a lion or a bird, and with the face of a horse or a dog. They are also supposed to eat human beings. Dak s a In Indian thought, a deity bound up with the concept of the creative power. He is regarded as the son of the world creator → Praj a pati, from whose right thumb he is said to have arisen. He is also invoked as progenitor of the human race. According to one tradition, → Diti is his daughter. Daktyloi (Greek daktylos \u0001 finger) In Greek tradition, demonic beings who discovered the art of working in metal. They may originally have had phallic sig- nificance. They are indigenous to Asia Minor and Crete, and form part of the ret- inue of the Magna Mater. A distinction is often made between right-hand daktyloi , who worked as smiths, and left-hand dak- tyloi , who were active as sorcerers and magicians. Dala kadavara (also known as gar a yak a ) In the beginning probably, an elephant goddess of the Singhalese: dala \u0001 tusk. Later, after the introduction of Buddhism, it was believed that the now demonized god was a bringer of illnesses and misfortune. One way of keeping him off is to hold a ceremonial masked dance. Damballa A divine being venerated on Haiti, whom all the other → Loa regard as their father. His sacred colour is white, and his symbolical creature is the snake. Accordingly, St John the Evangelist, who is portrayed with a snake (because of the legend of the beaker of poisoned wine), is regarded as a manifes- tation or variant of Damballa. Damgalnunna (Damkina; in Greek form, also Dauk e ) Old Mesopotamian goddess, wife of → Enki, and mother of Damgalnunna 47"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"→ Marduk.

Dana (also found as Ana) In Ireland the mother of the gods ( → Tuatha De Danann); in mythology she is hardly to be distinguished from → Ana. D a navas Half-divine half-demonic beings in Indian tradition. They were ban- ished by → Indra to live in the ocean. The monster → Bali was one of their number. Dáphne (Greek \u0001 laurel tree) Daughter of the river-god → Peneios. She was a beautiful nymph, who fled from → Apóllon when he was making advances to her. When Apóllon persisted in pursuing her, she was changed at her own wish into a laurel tree. Daramulum Son of the Australian god of creation → Baiame. He rates as a mediator between his father and human- kind, whose progenitor he is. In addition he was raised to the status of a lunar being. His name means ‘onelegged’. Images of this god fashioned from clay are only shown at initiation ceremonies. Da-shi-zhi (‘the strongest’) In Chinese Buddhism, a female Bodhisattva ( → Mah a sthamaprata). Through the power of love she was able to break out of the rule of Karma, thus opening a way for all creatures to escape from the cycle of rebirth. In art she is shown receiving souls in the shape of flowers in the heav- enly paradise. Datin A god often invoked in Thamudic (old north Arabian) inscriptions. Neither his name nor his function are clearly under- stood: it has been suggested that the name might mean ‘he who seizes’, or that the root meaning is ‘fertility’, ‘abundance’. Debata Among the Toba-Batak in Sumatra, this word is used to denote both an individual god and divine power in general. Decuma → Parcae Dedun (Dewden) Egyptian god, lord and giver of incense.

Deive Lithuanian appellation for divinity; certain stones which were the object of veneration were called deyves . With the coming of Christianity, the word came to mean a heathen deity or a fairy of some kind. Dema-deities A.E. Jensen has pro- posed this lable for a category of mythical primeval beings who are revered in primi- tive planter-cultures as bringers of these cultures. They occupy a midway position between gods and men. It is to their death that men owe the first cultivable plants. In this connection, the myth of the maiden Hianuwele is particularly well-known. The word dema is taken from the language of the Marindanim who live in New Guinea. Demeter (abbreviated form Deo) Greek goddess of the earth and of fertility, daugh- ter of → Kronos and of → Rheia. While searching for her daughter → Persephone, stolen from her by → Hades, she was well received in Attika, and showed her thanks by teaching the king’s son Triptolemos how to organise his fields and planting. Her attribute is the ear of corn. 48 Damona"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Her epithet Melissa ( \u0001 bee) indicates her maternal and nourishing function. According to Hesiod, her liasion with Iason produced Plutos, the god of riches and the epitome of all the gifts of the earth.

The mys- teries enacted in honour of Demeter at Eleusis took place in a shrine which was accessible only to initiates, who were bound by solemn vows to secrecy.

It is in Deng that the universal spirit has revealed himself to humankind. Dercetius A mountain-god venerated in ancient Hispania. Dev (pl. dev.k) In Armenian belief, spirit beings corresponding to the Iranian → da e vas. They were held to be immor- tal; they lived in ruins and appeared to man in various guises.

Deva (Sanskrit \u0001 heavenly, divine) The general Vedic appellation for what is divine. According to the Rigveda there are 33 devas. In Hinduism, the word is used for a certain category of traditional gods, whose significance falls far short of the national gods like → F iva or → Vi sj u. The Mah a bh a rata speaks of 3333 gods. Among the devas are the → A dityas who rule the heavens, the → Rudra who con- trol the atmosphere and the → Vasus who are of the earth. In the original Vedic scheme of things the devas were immor- tals; in the post-Rigveda period they are part of creation; and in Jainism and Buddhism the gods are subject to the law of Karman like other creatures. In Buddhist texts, the devas appear almost exclusively as disciples or servitors of → Gautama Buddha. Devaputra (‘son of the gods’) In Buddhism, a designation for gods, other- wise unnamed, of lower rank. The term is also sometimes used pejoratively for the gods of Hinduism. Devel (or Del) This is what the gipsies call their highest being. Contact with Christianity led to a distinction between baro (or phuro ) devel , ‘great’ or ‘old’ god, and tikno (or tarno ) devel , ‘small’ or ‘young’ god: the latter being Christ. The word devel is cognate with Sanskrit deva \u0001 god. Devi In Indian religions, the designa- tion of female deities, which may be incarnations of natural phenomena (e.g. → U s as) or hypostatizations (e.g. → V a c).

Dhy a ni-Buddhas The five ‘meditat- ing’ Buddhas who arose from the primeval Buddha ( → Adibuddha), and who are classified in terms of heavenly quarters, colours, seasons, magic formu- lae and phonological divisions of the Devanagari script. Individually, they are named as → Vairocana, → Ak s obhya, → Ratnasambhava, → Amit a bha and → Amoghasiddhi. These heavenly Buddhas are, in a certain sense, the inef- fable body of the dharma, while the five ‘human’ Buddhas who appear on earth during our age form its manifest and material emanation. The term Dhy a ni- Buddha is being gradually replaced by ‘tath a gata’ (‘the perfected one’, ‘(having) thus fared’). Diana Ancient Italian goddess of woods and forests; in Rome and Latium, she was also held to be the protectress of virginity, and she was worshipped as the moon-goddess. Her name is derived from Diviana \u0001 the shining one (female). As goddess of the federal cult of the Latins she had a temple on the Aventine Hill. Tales from Greek myth about the divine huntress → Artemis were taken over by the Romans and applied to Diana. Dian-Cecht In ancient Ireland, a god of healing who could heal wounds mirac- ulously.

Dimme Sumerian female demon of puerperal fever and diseases of infants, often known as ‘daughter of → An’. She corresponds to the Akkadian → Lama m tu. Diomédes One of the most celebrated Greek heroes in the Trojan Wars: proba- bly in origin an ancient war-god in Argos. This would explain why he is presented in the Iliad as an opponent equal in birth, if not superior to → Ares and → Aphrodíte. He is regarded as the founder of several towns in southern Italy, where he was subsequently revered as a god. Diónysos Greek god of fertility, of wine and drunkenness. His name is taken to mean ‘son of Zeus’. His original home- land seems to have been Thrace and/or Asia Minor; his alternative name, Bakchos (Latin → Bacchus) may be of Lydian origin. According to the myth, his mother → Semele died when her lover → Zeus revealed himself to her in all his divine majesty as a bolt of lightning. Diónysos has several epithets; thus, Bromios (‘thun- derer’) and Lyaios (‘the deliverer’ of men from their cares). First and foremost, how- ever, he is the god who created the vine and caused milk and honey to flow from nature. His cult was tumultuous, ecstatic and orgiastic. Women (maenads or Bacchae) distracted by his influence ran and danced through the woods waving torches and thyrsus staves. The thyrsus staff entwined with ivy and vine and with a pine cone at the tip was the main attribute of the god; theriomorphically he was visualized as a goat or a bull, both of them symbols of animal fertility. In dionysiac processions a phallus was borne along. Dionysos was seen as a god who dies and is resurrected; and his entry into Athens on a ship on wheels was construed as a return from the underworld. In the later cult of Orphism he was equated with → Zagreus. Dioskúroi (Greek \u0001 ‘sons of Zeus’) The twin brothers Kastor and Polydeukes, a pair with many parallels in the mythol- ogy of other IndoGermanic peoples: e.g. in India, the A f vins, and among the German tribes the → Alcis. They came to live with men and helped them in battle and when they were in peril on the sea. In their cosmic function as sons of heaven they were thought of as theriomorphic; the Greeks called them leukippoi \u0001 hav- ing white steeds. Their cult has also an astral aspect, and they figure in the Zodiac as Gemini, the Twins. D i pamkara (‘Lighter of lamps’) A Buddha who preceded → Gautama.

Discordia → Eris Disir (Old Norse; Old High German idisi ) Collective appellation for certain god- desses of fertility and destiny in Germanic mythology. The disir sacrifice ( disablot ) performed in autumn, recalls the cults of vegetation gods and goddesses. These goddesses were also supposed to be help- ful as midwives, and in this function → Freyja bears the name ‘ dis of the Vanir’ (Vanadis). Among the West Germans, the disir took over the role of goddesses of destiny and fate, as well as that of god- desses of battle (cf. the first Merseburg Zauberspruch).

In Snorri’s Edda, a distinction is made between álfar who are light and beautiful in colour, and álfar who are dark. The álfar were the objects of a cult, and this distinguishes them from the dwarfs. They were seen as spirits of fertility and as protective spirits; often again their behav- iour suggests souls of the dead. They may suffer a transition into a demonic aspect, and then they are bringers of sickness and ill-fortune ( → Alp).

In popular belief and in classical art he is shown as the winged youth with his bow and arrows which he fires into the hearts of gods and men, thus awakening them to love. He also fosters friendship between men and boys, and this is why the Spartans paid homage to him before battle. His cult in Thespiai in Boeotia, was of very ancient standing: here he was worshipped in the form of a stone. His power to arouse and move the world led the Orphic cults to recognize him as creator of the world. → Ámor is the corresponding figure among the Romans.

They were, in general, well disposed towards human beings, though they were not slow to pun- ish those who failed to show gratitude. Such beings were called elves among the Germanic tribes, while the Baltic peoples knew them as → Laume. The word ‘fairy’ comes via Old French feie, fée from Latin fatua \u0001 (female) seer, and fatum \u0001 fate, destiny. In association with the Greek → Moirai and the Roman → Parcae, three fairies were thought to be the goddesses of fate. Fama Roman personification of rumour.

At a very early date Faunus was identified with the wolf-god → Lupercus.

Nothing further is known about him, but it has been suggested that he may be a god of thunderstorms whose origins go back to pre-Germanic times.

In Rome, her feast (Floralia) was celebrated from 28 April to the beginning of May.

It is likely that this Nordic Forseti corresponds to the Friesian god Fosite. Fortúna (also Fors Fortuna) To begin with, the old Roman goddess of women, whose cult was, in part at least, oracular. First and foremost, however, Fortúna turned into the goddess of good fortune; indeed, she herself, as her name indicates, personifies fortune, luck, which proves effective in a given situation. In Cicero’s time she was already being identified with the Greek → Tyché. In art she is portrayed with rudder, cornucopia and globe as attributes. In the Renaissance, Fortuna came back into popular favour as a motif in art – now, however, equipped with a wheel to remind the viewer that luck may not last. Frava y i (usually translated as ‘she who confesses’ or ‘she who is chosen’) In Old Iranian religion, the fravaˇ si denoted the spiritual preexistence of the believer, which watched over him as a protective spirit. As a collective, the fravaˇ sis helped → Ahura Mazda to create the world; they foster plants and, as riders armed with spears, they defend heaven. In their capacity as warriors they resemble the Indian → Maruts. Freyja (Old Norse \u0001 mistress, lady) North German goddess of love and fertility; one of her functions is to assist women in childbirth. Her attributes are the necklace called Brisingamen ( brisa \u0001 to shine, glitter; possibly a solar symbol), Freyja 63"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"a falcon cloak, and a chariot drawn by cats. She rides on the boar with golden bristles, Hildeswin. As a daughter of → Njörd she belongs to the race of the → Vanir; in due course, however, she joins the Aesir ( → As) and becomes the wife of Od (variant of → Odin). When she loses him she weeps golden tears for him. On occasion, she becomes indistinguishable from → Frigg. Cf. also → Gefjon. Freyr (Old Norse \u0001 Lord, master) North Germanic god of thriving crops and peaceful prosperity: the son of → Njörd, brother of → Freyja, and one of the → Vanir. In a temple in Old Uppsala there was a statue of the god in his phallic aspect as god of fecundity. The Swedish royal dynasty of the Ynglinge regarded him as their progenitor. In myth he figures as the owner of the miraculous ship Skidbladnir and goldenbristled boar Gullinborsti. The esteem in which Freyr was held is evident from his epithets such as ‘patron of the gods’ and ‘world-god’. Frigg (south German Frija, Lombard Frea) Germanic goddess, incorporating on the one hand gross sensuality (she is accused of adultery) and, on the other hand, the maternal principle. Her name is translated both as ‘she who is loved’ and also as ‘spouse’. She protects life and par- takes in the wisdom of her husband → Odin. If she had a specific cult nothing is known of it. The Latin dies veneris (‘day of Venus’) was taken over by the Germans as ‘Frija’s day’ (Friday). The historian Paulus Diaconus mentions the goddess as patroness of the Lombards. Fudo Myoo Japanese god who wields the sword of knowledge in his fight against the hate and the greed which are characteristic of ignorance. Fufluns Etruscan god corresponding to the Greek → Dionysos. The name may derive from an Indo-Germanic root meaning ‘to beget’ or ‘to swell, overflow’. On an altar in Tarquinia we find the cult name Pacha given to the god. Fujin God of the wind in Shintoism. He is shown carrying a sack full of winds on his shoulders. Fukuro kuju (Japanese \u0001 luck, riches, long life) Japanese god of good luck, portrayed with an exaggeratedly high cra- nium. He is often accompanied by a crane and a tortoise as symbols of longevity. Fulla (‘fullness’) Germanic goddess, attendant in retinue of → Frigg. The second Merseburg charm makes her Frigg’s sister. Furies → Erinyes Fu Shen Chinese god of luck. He is usually portrayed in the blue robes of an official, with his son on his arm. Often he forms a triad along with → Shou Lao and → Cai Shen. Fu-xi The first of the three Chinese cultural heroes; he instituted marriage, and we also have to thank him for teach- ing us how to fish. He married his sister → Nü-gua, thereby ensuring due balance in the forces of yin and yang . Nü-gua’s attribute is the compass while Fu-xi’s is the protractor: together the two symbolize the construction of the world – the round heaven and the square earth. Fylgir (or Fylgjur; Old Norse \u0001 female attendants) In Germanic belief, protec- tive spirits attached to individuals. If they choose to appear, it is in the form of a woman or an animal. They were not the object of any sort of cult. 64 Freyr"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"God G Maya god, so designated in spe- cialist literature, who represents → Kukulcan in his solar aspect: possibly the nocturnal stage of that aspect.

Demoted with the coming of Christianity to the status of an evil spirit. Gabriel (Hebrew \u0001 ‘the strong one of God’) In the Bible, an angel who appears as a messenger from God: first, in Daniel 8: 16–27. In the New Testament, it is he who brings Mary the tidings that God has chosen her to be the mother of his son (Luke 1: 26–28). In Jewish apoc- alyptic literature he figures as an angel of retribution and death; in Christianity as an archangel together with → Michael, → Raphael and → Uriel. In Islamic tradition he is called Gabra’il, and is at the apex of the angelic host. Gad A designation for various benefi- cent divinities in ancient north Arabia. Gad is really a personification of (good) luck, and corresponds to the Greek → Tyché. The name was also used by the Nabataeans for a specific god. Gaia (Ge \u0001 earth) Greek goddess; together with Chaos and → Éros she belongs to the first principles of the cosmos. F rom her are born heaven ( → Uranós) and sea ( → Pontos). Made preg- nant by Uranós, she gives birth to the → Titans and the → Cyclops. Her union with the underworld (Tartaros) results in the birth of the monster → Typhón. It was in Attica alone that Gaia was of religious significance. In Homer, she is invoked in oaths along with the sun ( → Hélios). In art, her beneficent fecundity is often sym- bolized by attributes such as a cornucopia and the fruits of the earth. Galla (Akkadian Gallu) Sumerian demon of the underworld. It was by Galla- demons that the god of vegetation → Dumuzi was taken to the underworld. Gandarewa In the Avesta, a demon living in the water who is constantly trying to swallow the good works of creation; finally he is slain by the hero Keres a spa. Gandharvas A class of Indian demigods, spirits of nature who inhabit the heaven of → Indra, along with the → Apsaras.

On south Indian monuments he wears a crown. In Nepal a form of Ga j e f a called Heramba appears, which has five ele- phant heads; while in Thailand the god is often depicted with four heads and two arms. Ga j apati was also taken over by Buddhism. Ga n g a The masculine form – Ganges – derives from Greek. Indian river-goddess; she is depicted with two or four arms. In her right hand she holds a water-pot, in her left a lotus. The Ga k g a is supposed to emerge from one of → Vi sj u’s feet and to flow into the moon and the starry firmament. Ganymédes Originally perhaps a demonic guardian of the well of life. In Greek saga he appears as a beautiful youth. → Zeus falls in love with him, and sends his eagle to abduct the youth and bring him to Olympus. There, he becomes the cup-bearer of the gods, who gives them their daily life-giving draught. In the late Hellenistic and Roman periods Ganymede was transferred to the heavens in the shape of Aquarius the Waterbearer.

Garmangabi(s) Beneficent goddess of the Sueves (Suebi), a Germanic tribe who lived in the Neckar area. The second component of the name – gabi – is proba- bly cognate with ‘give, gift’ (German, ‘geben, Gabe’), and it figures also in the name of a group of matronly goddesses whose cult was once practised in the Rhineland: Alagabiae, i.e. those who give richly. Cf. also → Gefjon. Garu w a 66 Ga n g a (Sanskrit garut \u0001 wing) The prince of birds in Indian mythology, the enemy of snakes and the most fervent devotee of Vi sj u, who rides on his back.

She was the local mother goddess of Laga m . Gaueko In Basque popular belief and mythology the lord of darkness, a spirit of the night. He may on occasion prove friendly and helpful; but he can also appear as a devil. He often manifests himself in the shape of a cow or as a gust of wind. Gaur i In Indian religion, a good- hearted and sympathetic variant of the Great Mother. She is, as her name sug- gests, the ‘white one’, contrasting thereby with the black → K a l i . Gautama Buddha poetically he is also called M akyamuni – ‘the wise man of M akya race’. He was able to withstand all the temptations put in his way by his adversary → M a ra. Gautama became the Buddha (‘the enlightened one’) who upon entry into Nirvana severs all connection between him and the world and who is then inaccessible even to prayer. In the course of time, however, he was deified and became the → Buddha prototype, the exemplar for all Buddhas, both past and future. The → Bodhisattvas and the → Dhy a ni-Buddhas are hypostases of him. His most important symbols are closely connected with his life on earth: the footprints (his presence on earth), the Bodhi-tree (enlightenment), the wheel (the teaching of the way), and the stupa (entry into Nirvana). Images of Buddha are char- acterized by the u sjis a , the raised portion of the cranium, and the u r ja , a radiant point (originally a lock of hair) between the eyebrows, signifying enlightment. Gayomard (Gay o Marta) The first human being in Iranian mythology; his name means ‘mortal life’. According to one tradition, it was from his body that the parts of the cosmos were fashioned. According to another version, his seed impregnated the earth from which there then emerged the first man and the first woman. From Gayomard’s decomposing body there arose the seven metals. As the first mortal being, this primeval human will be resurrected. Geb (earlier incorrect reading: Seb) Egyptian earth-god. The name is probably an old word for ‘earth’, which later fell into disuse; in the Pyramid texts we are told that the dead enter ‘geb’. One myth relates how the earth-god copulated with the sky-goddess ( → Nut) to beget the sun, thus becoming ‘father of the gods’. The kings of Egypt designated themselves as ‘heirs of Geb’. When the Geb 67 His real name was Siddharta of the Gautama family (Pali form Gotama);"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"god is represented anthropomorphically he is usually wearing the crown of Lower Egypt on his head.

Gebeleizis Herodotus mentions this god of thunderstorms venerated by the Thracians who lived in the Balkans; he has been identified with → Zalmoxis, but this is a moot point. Gefjon Germanic goddess belonging to the Aesir ( → As). Her name seems to be connected with the root meaning ‘to give’ (German geben ), and she herself lives up to her name by functioning as a goddess of good fortune and prosperity. In Denmark, she herself handles the plough. Among the south Germanic tribes her counterpart may well have been → Garmangabis. And behind both of these goddesses we may well discern the figure of the goddess of fertility → Freyja, who indeed bears the epithet ‘Gefjon’. Genii male and female winged figures; and, in the art of the ancient east, to hybrid beings with the heads of birds who appear in a posture of greeting or who are fertil- izing the sacred tree, e.g. on Assyrian relief tablets and, similarly, on Cretan cameos (see illustration). Today, the term denotes ghostly beings endowed with supernatural powers. Genius Roman deity, a personification of the creative powers invested in man: the female counterpart of Genius is → Júno. Every man was accredited with his own genius , representing his male vigour and strength; and under Greek influence this came later to correspond to → Daimon.

The belief that every place has its tutelary spirit, its genius loci , is a product of the Roman Empire. → Genii. Ge y tinanna (Sumerian \u0001 vine of heaven) Old Mesopotamian goddess, sister of the vegetation-god → Dumuzi, and wife of → Ningi m zida. The fact that she was equated with the ‘book-keeper’ of the Babylonian underworld → B e lets e ri, suggests that she too was connected in some way with the nether regions. Geu y Ta y an (‘fashioner of cattle’) In old Iranian religion the divine creator of cattle, often equated with → Ahura Mazda. Geu y Urvan (also as Go m urvan, Go m urun) In Old Iranian religion, the heavenly guardian of cattle. In poetry, he himself appears as a cow. The name means ‘soul of the cow’. Ghul → Jinn Gibil Sumerian god of fire; in Akkadian (Babylonian) he is called Girra 68 Gebeleizis (pl. of genius ) Protective spirits who guide human beings. In Etruscan and Roman art they were represented as naked winged youths. Since the seven- teeth century the term has been applied to"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"or Girru.

Even → Marduk once visited the fire-god in order to get his insignia of office cleaned when they had been soiled. Giants (Gigantes) In Greek mythol- ogy, a savage race of giants born from the earth ( ge genis ), implacable adversaries of the Olympian gods. They arose from the drops of blood spilt on the earth ( → Gaia) by the emasculated → Uranós. It is possible that the gigantes were originally embodiments of natural earth forces, such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. In their struggle with the gigantes (gigan- tomachia) the gods can only win with the help of a mortal ( → Heraklés). Gilgame y Early historical king of the Sumerian town of Uruk. In his mythologi- cal aspect he is shown fighting the heav- enly bull and → L uwawa, the demonic ruler of the cedar forest. He engages in a fruitless search for eternal life. After his deification he was counted among the gods of the underworld. The Hittites knew the hero under the names of Gi m .gim.ma m , the Hurrians as Galgami m . In texts from Asia Minor the name is always written with the determinative sign for a god. Giltine Lithuanian goddess of death. Her name derives from the verb gelti \u0001 to sting, harm. Clad in white, she approaches the house in which the sick person lies; then she strangles or suffocates him. Glaúkos (Greek \u0001 bluish-green) A sea-god known for his gift of prophecy who was very popular among sailors and fishermen in the ancient world. The legend is that he was once a fisherman himself who became a god when he ate of a magic herb and jumped into the sea. On occasion, he shares with other sea-gods the name halios geron (‘the old man of the sea’). Gluskap (Kluskave) Cultural hero among the north-east Algonquin of Canada. Born of a virgin, he fights his evil twin brother, and, after the great flood, he creates a new earth out of a piece of mud. Occasionally he is con- ceived in the form of a hare.

Goibniu In ancient Ireland the god of the blacksmith’s craft, whose magic pow- ers enabled him to turn out weapons which could not fail. The name is derived from goban \u0001 smith. Grievously woun- ded in a battle with the → Fomore, he was restored to health in a fountain of youth. Goibniu possessed the mead that gave eternal life. In the Welsh tradition the god is called Govannon; farmers need his help to clean the ploughshare. Gong Gong Chinese devil who lets loose the great flood and who is the adver- sary of the ruling god. He is embodied in a black dragon and he is attended by the nine-headed, snake-bodied Xiang Yao, whose excretions generate evil-smelling springs and swamps. Gorgons In Greek mythology, the three daughters of the sea-god → Phorkys, named Stheno, Euryale and Medusa. They were winged creatures, with snakes for hair and prominent Gorgons 69"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"tongues. The gorgonaion , a representation of the horrifying head of the gorgo , was used in temples and at graves to ward off evil powers. Alone among the three sisters Medusa was mortal, and when → Perseus struck off her head, the goddess → Athéne fixed it to her shield. Reference to ‘the gorgon’ in the singular is always to Medusa. Gou Mang and Ru Shou The messen- gers of the Chinese sky-god: the former promises good luck and long life, while the second augurs punishment and disas- ter. They share the attribute of the double dragon. Gou Mang is associated with the spring and the east; Ru Shou with autumn and the west. Govannon Celtic god of the Welsh, corresponding to the Irish → Goibniu. Graii (Greek \u0001 old women) The daughters of the sea-god → Phorkys, who guard the way to the Gorgons. They have one eye and one tooth among the three of them. Gr a ma-devat a (‘village deity’) A local tutelary god in India.

A rock or stone, unadorned save for red colouring, marks the seat of the gr a ma-devat a . Grannus Gallic god of healing. The city of Aquae Granni (Aachen) was a cen- tre of his cult. The name may come from a Celtic root ghrena , meaning ‘hot, warm’, which would connect the god with hot springs. Grannus is one of the gods whom Caesar designated as → Apollo(n). Gratiae, Graces (Latin gratia \u0001 grace, charm) In Roman belief, divine figures incorporating youthful grace and joie de vivre ; they correspond to the Greek → Charites. They symbolize the arts of sculpture and poetry. They are mostly portrayed as naked, often garlanded and with flowers. Guan Di Chinese god of war, patron of literature and protector of trade and mer- chants. In the Manchu dynasty he was particularly venerated because of his war- like functions; but in other periods of Chinese history he was regarded as the guardian of righteousness which protects men from strife and evil. In origin, Guan Di was an ordinary man called Guan Zhong done to death by his adversary, but later deified on account of his many and signal virtues. Guan Yin A female → Bodhisattva ven- erated in China, who developed from → Avalokite f vara. She is enthroned on a mountain or an island in the Eastern Sea.

In the old Babylonian period she was equated with → Nin’insina, and the dog was the symbolical animal of both. Gullveig A sorceress belonging to the → Vanir race of gods in Old Norse mythology, though with pronounced demonic traits. It was through Gullveig that the lust for gold entered the world: a lust, to which even the Aesir ( → As) suc- cumbed. The latter made three unsuccess- ful attempts to burn Gullveig. Gul- y e y (also as Gul-a m e m ) Hittite god- desses who always appear in the plural. A possible but not universally accepted translation of their name is ‘scribes’ or ‘determiners (female) of fate’. In the Hurrian pantheon they were called W utena. They are the goddesses of fate who dispense good and evil, life and death. In this function, they are comparable with the Greek → moirai . Gurzil A god in the shape of a bull, venerated in ancient Tripolitania. One tradition relates that he was begot by → Ammon on a cow.

Gwydyon 71"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Ha The old Egyptian god of the west- ern desert: hence his epithet ‘Lord of the Libyans’. As god of the west, he plays a part in the cult of the dead; and on sar- cophagi of the Herakleopolites period he is shown seated at the right hand of the defunct person, i.e. at the west side. He is depicted in purely human form, and in the script he bears the determinative of the desert on his head.

Hades (Aidoneus, from Greek aides \u0001 the invisible one) Greek god of the underworld, son of → Kronos and of → Rheia, husband of → Persephóne. His name is no doubt connected with the magic cap conferring invisibility which Hades possessed. As Pylartes (‘closer of gates’) the god watches over the entrance to his realm, to ensure that no one who enters can turn and go back. His cult seems to have been confined to Pylos. As the interior of the earth has treasure hidden in it, he was also called Plutos ( plutos \u0001 riches) and coupled with → Plutos. His Roman counterpart is → Orcus. Hadúr (Hungarian had \u0001 army, úr \u0001 master) In the first half of the nine- teenth century, this designation was used in Hungary for the War Lord of the spreading light, in contrast to → Ármány. This is a poetic recapitulation of older tra- ditions, according to which the supreme god of the Hungarians was comparable with the Roman god of war → Mars. Hah Egyptian god, personification of infinity and eternity. He was regarded as the bearer of heaven, and is accordingly depicted with arms outstretched, often supporting the sky. His image provides the hieroglyph of the word for ‘million’. As an ornamental symbol the figure of Hah carries a palm-frond (a year-sign) on his head or in his hands. He is often associated with the god of the atmosphere → M u. Hainuwele A → dema -deity in the mythology of the Wemale people on the island of Ceram in the Moluccas.

The north is the heavenly quarter allotted to him. Hapi (2) Egyptian god, a personifica- tion of the Nile, represented as a well- nourished man. Although he was des cribed as ‘father of the gods’, no specific cen- tres were devoted to his cult. He is usu- ally depicted as one making sacrifice (i.e. bringing gifts) to gods and kings. Harachte (also Hanumat \u0001 he who has strong jaws) In India, an ape venerated as a god. Indra hurled a thunderbolt at him and smashed his left jaw, because he tried to grab the sun (believing it was something to eat). Hanuman was regarded as the patron saint of learning.

In one temple founded by Ramses III he is invoked as ‘mighty god, lord of heaven’. Harendotes (‘Horus, who protects his father’) in Egyptian texts, a special form of → Horus who ensures the continued sur- vival of his father → Osiris in the under- world.

Harmerti (‘Horus of the two eyes’) Egyptian tutelary god of Seden (in the delta) who denotes → Horus as the falcon of heaven. The two eyes are sun and moon. A triumphant hero, he does battle with → Apophis. Haroeris (in Plutarch Harueris) The Egyptian form of the name, Her-ur, means ‘the elder Horus’. The designation serves to distinguish the old falcon-god → Horus from the Horus of the Osiris myth: that is to say, the god is a theologi- cal device. Haroeris is a sky-god, and in the tradition of Kom Ombo he is the son of the sun-god → Re. In the sequel, he becomes indistinguishable from → M u. Because he fights to regain the lost eye of the sun, he became the tutelary god of oculists. Harpies (Greek harpyiai \u0001 the snatchers) Female malevolent demons in Greek mythology.

To placate them, people throw pieces of bread or cous-cous into the river. H a y am(m)eli The Hittite god of black- smiths and the art of wrought iron. A certain tree was sacred to him, but exactly which tree is not known. Hathor Egyptian sky-goddess. Her name means ‘house of Horus’, where ‘house’ may be taken to denote both the cosmic house (heaven) and the womb. At an early period, Hathor was regarded as the mother of the sun-god → Horus, until replaced in this function by → Isis. Thanks to the conception, prevalent in the Nile delta, of the sky as an enormous cow, the goddess herself was portrayed in the form of a cow. Mostly, however, she is depicted anthropomorphically, in which case she bears the cow’s horns on her head with the solar disc between them. She is also the goddess of dancing, of music and love; and in this capacity her main attrib- ute is the sistrum, a kind of rattle. An ancient tree cult is also connected with Hathor – she is ‘queen of the date-palm’ and ‘queen of the sycamore’ – and she dispenses food and drink to the dead. Hatmehit (‘first of the fishes’) Egyptian goddess, the centre of whose cult was at Mendes. She is portrayed in anthropomorphic form, and she bears a fish (dolphin?) on her head. Hatuibwari Hybrid being, half divine, half demonic snake, on the island of San Cristoval in Melanesia. She has a human torso, four eyes and four breasts, in order to suckle all created creatures. On her back she has two wings. It is widely believed that the winged snake fertilizes the mothers of priests. This snake-like being can also appear under the name of Agunua, and it is from him that the human race derives. Haubas (Hobas) A pre-Islamic god frequently mentioned in Sabaean (south Arabian) inscriptions. It has been sug- gested that he may represent a particular form of → ’Attar."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Haukim Old South Arabian deity.

Haurvat a t is also associated with life after death. Hayagr i va (‘Horse’s neck’) One of the Buddhist → Krodhadevat a s. He is of dwar- fish stature, with a pot belly and a horse’s head. In Indian literature he is regarded as an avatar of → Vi sj u, in Buddhism as an emanation of → Amit a bha or of → Ak s obhya. In Tibet, he belongs to the pro- tective deities who see to it that demons are kept at bay. H azzi Mountain god of the Hittites and the Hurrians. He forms part of the retinue of the god of weather, and he was invoked in Hittite state treaties as god of oaths. As a mountain – geographically, Mount Sapon near Ugarit – L azzi is the seat of the gods. H ebat (Hepat, Hapatu) The chief god- dess of the Hurrians, ‘Queen of heaven’ and wife of the weather-god → T x sub. She was also taken into the Hittite pan- theon and then frequently equated with the sun-goddess → Arinna. She is por- trayed as standing on a lion or a panther; sometimes she is shown sitting on a throne, wearing the pointed regal cap. Hébe (Greek \u0001 ‘freshness of youth’) Daughter of → Zeus and of → Hera, Greek goddess of youth. She is active as the cup-bearer of the gods, and she is the wife of the deified → Heraklés.

It is said that he weighed himself down with stones and threw himself into the river, thus achiev- ing immortality. Until the end of the Zhou Dynasty (256 BC) a maiden was sacri- ficed to him every year by being thrown into the river as his bride. H edammu Snake demon of the Hurrians. He lives in the sea and is insa- tiably voracious. Hedetet The scorpion-goddess in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. As ‘daughter of Re’ she merges into the figure of → Isis. Heimdall (Old Icelandic Heimdallr) Germanic god who acts as watchman of heaven. His dwelling is called Himinbjörg (‘heavenly mountain’). He is the son of nine giant maidens (held to be daughters of the Aesir ( → As)). The etymological derivation of the name is uncertain; at one time the meaning ‘the brightly shin- ing one’ was proposed which would make Heimdall a god of light or a sun- god. Another proposal was based on com- parison with a poetical word for ‘ram’ – heimdali : Heimdall would then figure as the focal point for a primitive agrarian cult. Yet another suggestion – that he was the progenitor of the human race – is based on a passage in the Völuspa. As ‘watchman of the gods’, Heimdall stands at the bridge Bifröst (the Milky Way?) whence he announces the onset of Ragnarök by blowing the gjallarhorn . This juxtaposition of horn and world-tree has led to yet another interpretation of Heimdall – as a personification of the axis mundi . Heitsi-Eibib National hero of the Hottentot people in South Africa. He is invoked as ‘grandfather’ and he grants the hunter luck in the chase. More than one place is cited as the scene of his death, and at all of these sites – each of them seen as his grave – a heap of stones is 76 Haukim"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Hemsut 77 erected in his honour. In terms of comparative religion he is probably best classified as a kind of bush-spirit. Hekáte the daughter of → Loki and the giantess Angrboda; and as the sister of → Fenrir and of the → Midgard-snake, she has demonic character. Hel is entitled to claim dominion over all those who die in the land except those who fall in battle. Even the gods must tread the ‘way of Hel’ – like → Balder after his early death. Heléne Daughter of → Zeus and of → Leda, sister of the → Dioskuroi. In origin, a goddess of vegetation, and honoured in some places as a tree divinity (Dendritis): in Sparta, the plane tree was sacred to her. The myth tells how she was abducted by the Trojan prince Paris, an act which led to the outbreak of the Trojan war. Heliades → Phaéton Hélios Greek sun-god, the son of the → Titan → Hyperion and the female Titan Theia; brother of the moon-god → Seléne. Hélios is he who sees all and hears all, and who is invoked as witness to an oath sworn. As god of light he can make the blind see – but equally he can strike sinners blind. He played little part in Greek religious observance, though he was worshipped on Rhodes and, to some extent, in the Peloponnese. In art, Hélios was often represented driving a chariot drawn by four (often winged) horses, his head surrounded by a halo of rays. In late classical times he was equated with → Apóllon. His Roman counterpart was → Sol. Hemen A falcon-god venerated in the Egyptian city of Hesfun (Asphynis). Thought to be identical with → Haroeris. Hemera → Nyx Hemsut (Hemuset) Egyptian god- desses of fate, female counterparts of → Ka, who were also seen as protective spirits. They were supposed to take a new-born child into their arms. Their A goddess in Greek mythology who origi- nally hailed from Asia Minor (Caria). She does not appear in Homer. She is a chthonic deity, the mistress of all sorts of nocturnal nastiness, including necromancy. Her ghostly aspect is indicated in her epithet Antaia (‘she who encounters you’): on her nocturnal hunt she could spell disaster for those who met her. She has snakes in her hair, she carries a torch, and is attended by howling dogs. In spite of all this, she was a popular goddess, and in Athens there was a small altar to her in front of every house. Hekáte was also seen as the goddess of cross-roads. In this capacity she was called Enodia or Trioditis, and was then depicted as three-headed or with three bodies. Heket Egyptian goddess in the form of a frog (a symbol of life and fertility). She ranked as a primeval goddess and tutelary goddess of childbirth. In the town of Kus she was revered as the mother of → Haroeris.

He corre- sponds to the Akkadian god → I m um. Heng E (Change-e) Chinese goddess of the moon, a younger sister of the river god → He Bo. After stealing the pill of immor- tality from her husband, the sun-god → Shen Yi, she fled to the moon, where she has lived ever since as a toad. She is rep- resented in art wearing regal garments; in her right hand she carries the disc of the moon. Heng E is a symbolical figure for the cold, dark female principle ( yin ). Hephaistos (Latin Hephaestus) Greek god of fire, of smiths and craftsmen. The son of → Zeus and of → Hera. As he was lame when he came into the world, his mother threw him out of Olympus. In his underworld smithy he fashions pre- cious weapons and implements, e.g. the sceptre of Zeus, the chariot of → Hélios and the aegis of → Athená. In his work, he is helped by the → Cyclops. In origin, Hephaistos was a god of Asia Minor; and on the island of Lemnos he was revered as the embodiment of the fire which breaks out of the earth. At the end of the sixth century BC his cult reached Athens. The Romans identified him with → Vulcanus. Hera (Here) Greek goddess, daughter of → Kronos and of → Rheia, sister and wife of → Zeus, the king of the gods. She is the mother of → Arés, → Hephaistos, → Eileithyia and of → Hébe. She keeps a jealous eye on her divine husband, whose amorous liaisons infuriate her. Hera was invoked as the guardian of wedlock and she also figured as goddess of childbirth. In Athens and on the island of Samos her union with Zeus was celebrated as ‘holy wedlock’ ( hieros gamos ). She was a par- ticular object of veneration for women, and her epithet was teleia , i.e. ‘she who brings fulfilment’. The main centre of her cult was in Argos, and hence she was also known as Argeia. Her sacred animal was the cow, and among her attributes were the peacock and the insignia of her status as queen of the gods, the diadem and sceptre. Her Roman counterpart was → Juno. Heraklés 78 H endursanga (Greek \u0001 ‘made famous by (the land of ) Hera’) Son of → Zeus, the father of the gods, and the mortal Alkmene.

In his aspect as kallinikos , the radiant victor in all forms of contest, he became the national hero of the Greeks. Among the ordinary people he was very popular as someone one could turn to in need, and a protector against all sorts of unpleasantness ( alexikalos ). Young people especially saw in him their protector, and they called him Herakles Enagonios. The cult of this demi-god was also widespread in Italy ( → Hércules). Among his attributes is the skin of the Nemean lion. Hércules The Latin name of the Greek → Heraklés. The demi-god had himself travelled far and wide, and it was fitting that he should become god of trade and traffic in goods and patron of traders. In Rome’s imperial age, as the invincible conqueror of all difficulties (Hércules invictus ) and the benefactor of mankind, he was magnified into the epitome of all the imperious and imperial virtues. Herensugue Among the Basques, a devilish spirit who appears in the shape of a snake, though one tradition gives him seven heads and the ability to fly. Hermanubis In the cult of Isis, the Egyptian god of the dead → Anubis was united in one figure with the Greek god who guided the souls of the dead → Hérmes. The priests of Hermanubis, the resultant amalgam, wore the dog’s head of Anubis, and carried the herald’s staff (the kerykeion ) of Hérmes. Hermaphróditos Son of Hérmes and of → Aphrodíte. He was passionately loved by the spring-nymph Salmakis, so much so that their bodies merged and united forever, thus giving rise to an androgynous being. The cult of this twin divinity (which may have ancient oriental antecedents) reached Athens by way of Cyprus. Hérmes One of the most popular of all Greek gods; the son of → Zeus and the mountain nymph → Maía. Sacred to him were the piles of stones erected in ancient Greece to guide travellers – hence, presumably, his name (Greek hermaion \u0001 pile of stones). In front of Greek houses stone pillars used to stand ( hermen ) in which Hérmes was supposed to reside in order to protect the dwelling from harm. In this capacity, the god was known as Pylaios or Propylaios. Hérmes is the messenger of the gods, equipped with herald’s staff ( kerykeion ), winged shoes and hat; he is protector of tradesmen and travellers – but also of thieves. The myth relates how Hérmes while still a small boy, stole a herd of cat- tle belonging to his brother → Apóllon. In his aspect of psychopompos he leads the souls of the dead into the beyond. He is also ‘the good shepherd’ and is often por- trayed carrying a ram under his arm or"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"over his shoulder ( kriophoros \u0001 ram- bearer).

Hermes Trismegistos (Greek \u0001 Hermes the thrice great) The Greek name for → Thot, the Egyptian god of writing and learning. As the putative founder of phi- losophy and mysticism he was also known as Hermes Logios. In late antiq- uity he was regarded as the harbinger of the one true God and creator of the world. His role in hermetic literature is that of a sage and legislator. Hermod(u)r A deified hero in the north Germanic myth of → Balder. After the murder of Balder, he rides to → Hel as a messenger of the gods, to ascertain whether there is any possibility of Balder’s return from the underworld. Hermod and the Danish king Heremod in the Beowulf saga are probably one and the same. Heron A god who appears on Egyptian monuments of the Ptolemaic and Roman periods; he is shown as a rider who is bringing a libation to a rampant snake. This is very probably the horseman god → Heros, who was worshipped in Thrace and Asia Minor and who was brought by the troops of Alexander the Great and the Diadochoi to Egypt. Heros A Thracian god represented as a horseman who makes his appearance as the conqueror of a monster. He was also a god of the dead, and as such his image was used on funerary steles. His name is cog- nate with the Greek word heros \u0001 hero. Heruka Buddhist god, an emanation of → Ak s obhya. In Tibet, he is reck- oned as one of the protective deities ( → I st adevat a s). As normally represented, he is three-eyed, shows his teeth and has tousled hair; he has a severed human head and he is smeared with ashes, and he sits or dances on a corpse. In some represen- tations he appears with his female partner ( → Praj na ) in the Yab-yum posture: in this case he bears the name Hevajra ( \u0001 Oh Vajra!). A particular form he may adopt is that of Sapt a k s ara. Inter alia , Heruka confers Buddhahood and protects the world from the forces of evil. Hesat (‘the grim one’, ‘the wrathful one’) Divine white cow: she was supposed to be ‘the first of the cows’ and was later asso- ciated with → Isis.

Hesperides Greek nymphs who guard the tree with the golden apples in the gar- den of the gods, along with the dragon → Ladon. They were supposed to be daugh- ters of the night ( → Nyx) or of the giant → Atlas. Hestia (Greek \u0001 hearth) Greek goddess of the heart and its fire: daughter of → Kronos and of → Rheia. The hearth was the sacred focus of the household, the central point which vouch-safed protec- tion: and here a small sacrifice was made to the goddess before meals. The corresponding fig ure in the Roman pantheon was → Vésta. Hetepet An Egyptian cult centre in the north of Heliopolis.

Hez-ur Egyptian baboon-god; ‘the great white one’. Even in the Old Kingdom, he was taken to be a particular form of → Thot. Hiisi Karelian (east Finnish) forest- god, later demoted to the status of forest- spirit or troll. The word ‘hiisi’ is now used to mean ‘devil’ in a diluted sense. Hike (another reading is Heka) In ancient Egypt, the personification of the magical properties which are inherent in the gods. Theological speculation made Hike the eldest son of the primeval god → Atum, with whose creative organs (heart and tongue) Hike was further identified. Hike even had his own shrines in On and near Memphis. It is noteworthy that doc- tors liked to call themselves ‘priests of Hike’: in other words they wanted to invoke his magic powers in the treatment of their patients. Hilal (Hillaliy) The name means ‘new moon’, and denoted the moon-god, espe- cially in his aspect as new moon, in ancient Arabia. Himavat (Sanskrit himavan \u0001 bearing snow) Personification of the Himalaya mountains. This mountain god is the father of → P a rvat i and of the → Ganga.

Hintubuhet (Hin, Hina \u0001 woman) The supreme being venerated on the island of New Ireland in Melanesia. In spite of her name she is an androgynous being, as both parties to a marriage invoke her as progenitor in terms of their own sex: in one aspect she is equated with the male sun and the male butterfly Talmago, in the other aspect she is equated with the female moon and the female butterfly Heba. Hira v yagarbha (Sanskrit \u0001 womb of gold) In the Rigveda, the unnamed god of creation, who subsequently appears as → Praj a pati. In later Sanskrit literature the name is used to denote → Brahman. Hira v yakasipu → Narasi y ha Hirguan → Orahan Hittavainen (Hittauanin) The god of the hare-hunters of the Karelian (east Finnish) people, mentioned in an ancient list of gods. The etymology of the word is uncertain; it may be connected with Finnish hitto \u0001 devil, or it may be derived from the name of the patron saint of hunters, Hubertus, who was introduced into these parts along with Christianity. Hlodyn (Hlödin) Old Icelandic goddess of the earth and of fertility: one tradition"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"makes her the mother of → Thor, a role allotted in other traditions to → Fjörgyn. There is probably a connection here, both etymological and semantic, with the name of the west German goddess Hludana; and the latter has been seen as the matrix for the figure of Frau → Holle. Hludana → Hlodyn Höd(u)r North Germanic god, son of → Odin. His name means ‘battle, strug- gle’ but nothing about him suggests a war-like character. In the myth, Hödur is blind; and he judges people not by their outward appearance but by their inner worth. Incited by the malicious → Loki, he unwittingly slays his brother → Balder. Holle Like → Bercht, originally the leader of a more or less demonic band of spirits (named as Hollen or Hulden), who are popularly believed to be sometimes friendly but at other times punitive. Holle lets the newly born emerge from her underworld realm, where she also receives the souls of the dead. When she shakes her cushions, it snows. Bishop Burchard of Worms ( c . 1000) knew about Frau Holle, and translated her name as → Diana, after the Roman goddess. It is possible that Frau Holle is connected with the old Germanic goddess Hludana ( → Hlodyn). Hong and Ha → Dv a rap a la Hönir North Germanic god who had a hand in the origin of the human race, along with → Odin and → Lodur (Loki ?): Odin gave the first men life, Lodur gave them language, sight and hearing, while Hönir gave them understanding and feel- ings.

He is shown as a young man with a lance and a cornucopia. Horae (Greek horai ) The Greek god- desses of the three seasons: Spring, Summer and Winter. Originally they represented the seasonal forces of growth. The Athenians called them Thallo (goddess of blossom), Auxo (goddess of growth) and Karpo (goddess of ripened fruit). According to Hesiod they are the daughters of → Themis, and have ethical significance: their names in this version are → Eunomía (law and order), → Díke ( justice) and → Eirene (peace). Horagalles A god venerated by the Lapps: ‘the old man’, usually portrayed carrying two hammers. Reindeer used to be sacrificed to him. He is actually Thor, the god of thunder, borrowed from the Old Norse religion. Hor-Hekenu (‘Horus of ointments’) A specific form of → Horus worshipped in Bubastis; the burning heat surrounding him drives the powers of evil away. As ‘lord of protection’ he personifies the pro- tective ointment and the supernatural pow- ers attributed to it. He is usually portrayed in human form with the head of a falcon. Horus Egyptian god, whose name – meaning ‘he who is above’, ‘he who is afar’ – would seem to indicate a sky-god. He was depicted as a falcon, with the sun and the moon as his eyes. At the very beginning of the historical period, the king was equated with this divine falcon; and every Pharaoh’s name had the ‘Horus name’ as one of its elements. In line with the dualism characteristic of Egyptian thought, the mythological clash with → Seth (who deprives Horus of one of his eyes) leads to a division of their sphere of power: Horus is lord of Lower Egypt, Seth of Upper Egypt. As the bearer of the solar eye, Horus is closely connected with the 82 Hludana"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Huitzilopochtli 83 sun-god → Re (cf. also → Harachte).

Hubal Pre-Islamic god venerated in central Arabia. His anthropomorphic image in red carnelian still stands in the Ka’aba in Mecca; and it is possible that the black stone of the Ka’aba is connected with him in some way. The god was famous for his oracle (performed with seven arrows). Huh and Hauhet → Ogdoad Huiracocha (Viracocha) The supreme god of the Inca empire. Traditionally he was connected with Ti q huanaco, whose importance as a cult site extends back into pre-Inca times. According to the myth he was born of a virgin, and he often displays solar characteristics. His epithet Pachamac designates him as ‘creator of the world’. Those who fail to do fitting homage to the god are destroyed by fire or flood. Huitzilopochtli (‘humming-bird of the south’) Tribal god of the Aztecs; also a solar god.

Specialists in Central American studies refer to him as ‘god A’. Hun-Hunapu Among the Quiché Indians, the father of the divine twins → Hunapu and Ixbalanque. In the book of Popol Vuh it is related how the god lost his head (here, a solar symbol) while playing with a ball in the underworld: the head was hung up in a calabash tree which had previously never borne fruit, and as a result the tree became fruitful. Huracan High god and creator god of the Quiché Indians who live in Central America. He is the ‘heart of heaven’.

Ikenga I The function of this god, worshipped by the Ibo in Nigeria, was to guide men’s hands or arms correctly – hence his name which means ‘right upper-arm’. He is rep- resented wearing two enormous horns (symbolizing his power) with a sword and a severed human head in his hands. The two horns may be doubled; that is, there may be four of them.

Illapa (Ilyapa, also as Katoylla) The god of lightning, thunder and rainstorms in the pre-Columbian Inca empire. Illujanka Hittite snake demon, which was slain by the weather-god. The myth was taken up by the Canaanites in the form of the mythical struggle of → Baal Sapon against → Leviathan, and reached the Greeks as the story of → Typhón. The tale of the weather-god’s battle against Illujanka was recited at the feast of the New Year ( purulli ); a new era begins with the destruction of the mon- strous snake. Ilmarinen (ilma \u0001 air, weather) In Finnish myth, the ruler over wind and weather; he is also the protective deity of travellers. He is also the divine smith who studs the sky with stars, and who has cre- ated not only the vault of heaven but also the Sampo (probably the axis mundi ).

He is red or gold in colour, and he is mounted on horseback or sits in a chariot drawn by horses. As V r trahan, Indra is the great dragon-slayer, who frees the streams obstructed by → Vritra. In Hinduism, Indra is white in colour, clad in red, and he rides on the elephant Airavata which was generated by churning the ocean of milk. He is ruler of the easterly quarter. Indr aji or F ací ( \u0001 power) are named as his wives, and he is constantly accompa- nied by the → Maruts. In Jainism, the word denotes the highest rank in divine hierarchies: that is to say, each class of gods has its specific Indra. Ing Divine progenitor of the Germanic Ingwaeones who lived on the Baltic coast. The meaning of the word is not clear: ‘lance’, ‘yew’ or even ‘man’ have all been suggested. According to an Anglo-Saxon runic poem, the god Ing seems to be con- nected with the eastern Danes, and corre- sponds to the Yngoi of the Scandinavian tradition. It is possible that the Vandals brought the cult of Ing from their home- land in Sweden. Inguma A Basque spirit, something like an → Alp. He creeps into people’s houses by night and throttles them. Inmar Sky-god of the Finno-Ugric Votyak (Udmurt) people. The in part of the name means ‘sky’. The name is applied to other divine beings in their mythology, and after the coming of Christianity it was transferred to the Mother of God (‘Inmar-mother’). 88 Inar The god of foodstuffs in Shintoism, rep- resented as a bearded man carrying two bundles of rice. His messenger is the fox, and this is why there are always stone or wooden foxes sitting in front of Inari shrines. In popular belief, the god and the fox could merge together to form one being. In Japanese myth there was also a goddess of rice called Inara, who could assume the form of a fox. Incubus (Latin \u0001 he who lies on top) Among the ancient Romans, and even today in Italy, the name of an → Alp.

He was repre- sented by a gold disc with a human face. Inuus Old Latin god, invoked to pro- tect herds; later, equated with → Faunus. Io (1) In Greek mythology, the daughter of Inachos, the King of Argos. She was a priestess serving the morally strict → Hera, who was outraged to find → Zeus making love to her. There are differing ver- sions of what happened next: one tradition says that Zeus turned Io into a cow to hide her identity; another agrees about the cow but asserts that Hera did this to punish her. In any case, Io was handed over to the hundred-eyed watchman → Árgos for safe-keeping. Zeus organized her escape, and she wandered restlessly over the earth until she reached Egypt where her human form was restored to her, and she gave birth to → Epaphos. The Greeks resident in the Nile delta equated her with → Isis, who was usually represented with cow’s horns. Io (2) (or Kiho) The chief god of the Maori people in New Zealand. Some of the statements made about him suggest Christian influence: thus, Kiho is ‘the eternal one’, ‘the omniscient’, ‘the god of love’ and he who has created all things through ‘the word’. Only the priests and the high nobility knew anything about him, and his name might only be whis- pered in lonely places. On the Polynesian island of Mangaia, the word Io means something like ‘marrow’, ‘kernel’, and can also denote ‘god’. Ipet (Ipi in the Pyramid texts) Egyptian hippopotamus goddess who soon merged with a similarly named local goddess of Luxor to form a goddess of the Great Mother type. As the consort of the tutelary god Amun she figures as the ‘Queen of the two lands’ – that is, of Upper and Lower Egypt. Iris (Greek \u0001 rainbow) A sister of the → Harpies, a virgin goddess who hastens down from Olympus as messenger of the gods bearing the commandments of → Zeus and → Hera. She is usually shown as winged and bearing the herald’s staff. Irmin Old Germanic god, whom we can probably equate with the war-god Tiwaz ( → Tyr). Originally, the name seems to have meant ‘divine’, ‘holy’, but it came to mean ‘strong’, or ‘mighty’. The name of the Irmin-pillar in Saxony prob- ably refers to this god. The Irmingot (‘great god’) found in the Hildebrandslied is perhaps a late echo of this old Germanic god, though the poem itself shows Christian influence. I y ara (older form: E m ara) Ancient Mesopotamian goddess: ‘Queen of the judgment seat and of the sacrificial dis- play’, and guarantor of oaths. Her emblem is the scorpion. In Ugarit, her epithet was Hulmittu \u0001 snake, lizard. She was deeply venerated by the Hittites as ‘Queen of the mountains’. In Syria, it was her sexual potency that was emphasized.

Isis whom she received the child → Horus; she buried him and mourned him together with her sister → Nephthys. When, later, every dead person came to be identified with Osiris, she became protector of the dead. As ‘she who is rich in spells’ (Urthekau) she was accepted into the world of magic and necromancy. From the Middle Kingdom onwards, her solar aspect is displayed in her epithet ‘eye of → Re’. In addition, she was Queen of Sirius, and Greek authors (e.g. Plutarch) interpreted her as a moongoddess. In the Hellenistic period, Isis became patron of sea-farers, and was given a rudder as attribute. She was, with very few excep- tions, portrayed in human form; the cow’s horns and the sun disc she bears on her head she owes to her coalescence with the figure of → Hathor. I y kur Hittite weather-god, comparable with the Hurrian → Te m ub. His sacred number is 10 and his sacred animal the bull; his attributes are a club and shafts of lightning. He sits on two mountain-gods or rides in a chariot drawn by bulls. I m kur manifests himself in thunderstorms and rain; he is ‘king of heaven’ and helps the earthly king in time of war.

One myth tells of her descent to the under- world, where her sister → Ere m kigal ruled. In I m tar’s absence, all procreation ceases on earth. Although she is hailed as ‘virgin’ she has many lovers, notably Tammuz ( → Dumuzi). Like → Inanna, her Sumerian counterpart, she has, alongside her erotic aspect, both war-like and astral functions. She is the goddess of Venus as morning star, and on Middle and late Babylonian border markers she is represented as an eightpointed star. Her brother is → M ama m . Her importance was such that her name could be used as a general appellation for ‘goddess’; and iˇ star a ta are ‘the goddesses’.

It is doubtful whether there is any connection with → Isdes. Isten (2) Supreme god of the ancient Hungarians, sometimes conceived in monotheistic terms. He was seen as the creator of all things. Among his attributes were the arrow, the tree, the horse and the phallus. He sent his eagles to guide his people – the Hungarians – into their new homeland. His epithets include úr ( \u0001 lord, master) and el ] ( \u0001 the living one). With the coming of Christianity, Isten merged into the figure of God the Father.

Jagaubis Lithuanian fire-god, who was gradually ousted in popular belief and tradition by Gabija. Jahwe spurious form → Jehovah. In origin, Jahwe was very probably a mountain- god (Sinai). For the Israelites he was jahwe zebaoth , ‘the lord of hosts’. In I Samuel 17: 45, the word zebaoth refers to earthly hosts, but elsewhere the hosts may be of angels (I Kings 22: 19) or of stars (Deuteronomy 4: 19).

The Third Commandment states, ‘Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain,’ and this was taken to heart so seriously that while the four consonants of the name could be written – J H W H – the name itself was pronoun- ced with the vowels of ‘Adonai’ ( \u0001 Lord). Exactly what the name means is a disputed point: ‘he who exists’, ‘the breather’, ‘he who summons to existence’ are some of the suggestions, all of them questionable.

Metaphorically the double-headed god also stands for begin- ning and end, the threshold point at which the old year becomes the new, and accord- ingly January is named after him.

Yet another epithet of hers was Moneta, signifying ‘recollec- tion’; this epithet came to mean ‘coin’ because a mint was set up close to the temple of Moneta. Juno was originally an Etruscan goddess who was especially venerated in Vei. In Rome she was hon- oured by women in the feast of the Matronalia, held on 1 March.

Logos (Greek \u0001 word, reason) The ‘world principle’ in Stoicism, the most powerful philosophical movement in the Hellenistic age. As logos spermatikos it is the power that informs all things and brings all things about. It is the divine spirit, indeed God himself, from which the other, mythological gods have arisen. With Philo of Alexandria, the Logos takes on personal and anthropomorphic charac- teristics. In the New Testament, the Logos is used as a designation of the person of Jesus as the son of God. Lokap a las (‘world-guardians’) This designation appears, from the time of the Upani s ads on, with reference to the gods who guard the four heavenly quarters; they are also known as dikp a las , i.e., ‘guardians of the heavenly quarters’.

In one of his manifestations, as a mare, Loki is said to have given birth to the stallion Sleipnir. He can, in fact, take on almost any shape he wishes. Popular etymology has connected his name with the word log (German Lohe \u0001 fierce flames). Wherever Loki appears along with Odin, he acts as the factotum of the gods, never at a loss for sharp practice.

Lucifer (Latin \u0001 bringer of light) A name used in Christianity for the devil. It goes back to Isaiah 14: 12, where the casting into hell of the King of Babylon is likened to the fall of the resplendent morning star (Hebrew helal ).

His func- tions identify him as a god of war and of the magic arts, but poets benefit from him as well as warriors and magicians. The raven is particularly associated with him. In the Irish sagas, Lug is also called Lamfada \u0001 he of the long hand, and some students have seen in this a reference to the sun’s rays, just as his spear has been interpreted as indicating lightning.

There are ‘sea-mother’ ( → J u ras m a te) and ‘fire-mother’ (Uguns m a te), ‘berry-mother’ (Ogu m a te) and ‘plague-mother’ (Mera m a te). There is even ‘devil’s-mother’ (Joda m a te). Máter Matúta Old Italic goddess of the dawn and the morning light. Gradually she developed into a goddess of women and childbirth, and later, in her equation with → Inó, into a patron god- dess of seafarers. Matres In Roman Gaul, in Britain and in the Rhineland, a group of maternal deities, usually thought of as a trinity, though sometimes there seem to be only two of them. They are usually shown seated beside each other with baskets of fruit in their laps, or perhaps a cornu- copia. Often, the woman in the middle has a babe-in-arms. It is likely that veneration of the matres was limited to members of the household. Matsya In Indian mythology the piscine avat a ra in which → Vi sj u rescued → Manu from the waters of the deluge. Matsya 121"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Maui A sort of roguish demigod in Polynesian belief: on the one hand, he helped the gods to raise the vault of heaven and to order the course of the stars therein, on the other hand, he caught the sun in his net and stole fire in order to give it to man. Many inventions are due to Maui, for example the fish-trap and the cat’s cradle. His epithet is Tikitiki, which suggests some connection with the first man ( → Tiki). Maui was never the object of any religious cult. Mawu The sky-god of the Ewe people in Togo. He created the spirits ( mawuviwo \u0001 children of god), in order to provide a link between himself and human beings. He is the giver of all things, and he loves the colour white – even the food he par- takes of is white. Mawu is often equated with the deity known as Sodza ( → So). Among the Fong people in Dahomey, Mawu is female and identified with the moon; yet another version of the myth makes the god androgynous. Mawu is the sister of the sun ( → Lisa). M a y a (‘miraculous power’; later meaning ‘deception’) In Vedic times a designa- tion for the power of the gods, a power created by → Vi sj u as a female primeval principle, from which the world is gener- ated.

He sends souls into the bodies of new-born chil- dren, and receives into his heaven the souls of those who have died after leading a good life. Ma-zu A goddess worshipped on the southeast coast of China. Her epithet is tian-hou , ‘Queen of heaven’ and she is particularly helpful to fishermen in dis- tress on the seas.

Melqart (more precisely, milk-quart \u0001 city king) The chief god of Tyrus in Phoenicia, also venerated in the daughter- city of Carthage. He is connected with the sea and sea-faring and on coins he is shown riding on a sea-horse. At a later date, he was also seen as a sun-god, which may have had something to do with his equation with → Heraklés. Men A moon-god, particularly vener- ated in Phrygia in Asia Minor, and believed to rule not only over the heavens but over the underworld as well. When plants and animals flourished and pros- pered, this was ascribed to his heavenly influence. His epithet was tyrannos \u0001 master, a word which the Greeks took from the Lydian language. M e ness Old Latvian moon-god, hus- band of the sun-goddess ( → Saule) and tutelary god of travellers. He was invoked before setting out on a military campaign and at the consecration of a standard: that is to say, he had a military function as well. He also played a part in exorcism and incantation. Menhit (Menchit) An ancient Egyptian goddess in the form of a lion; her cult was especially associated with Latopolis (Esneh). Her name means ‘she who slaughters’, and this identifies her as a goddess of battle. Her husband was → Chnum, her son → Hike.

Mephistopheles (Mephisto) The name of the devil in the literature of necro- mancy and magic in the late Middle Ages, and in the Faust story. The name seems to be derived from Hebrew mephir \u0001 destroyer and tophel \u0001 liar. Mercurius (Mercury) The Roman god of trade and industry, whose shrine in Rome was on the Circus Maximus. Originally he was one of the ancient gods of riches and profit ( dei lucri ) and it was not until he was equated with the Greek → Hérmes that he became the god of trades- men and merchants. His name used to be derived from mercari \u0001 to carry on a busi- ness, but it now seems that an Etruscan origin is possible. His opposite number in the Etruscan pantheon is → Turms. Mercurius, Gallic Celtic names are extant for the god the Romans called Mercurius: thus, the Picts called him Adsmerius, while the Lingones and the Mediomatrici knew him as Clavariatis. He was especially venerated on mountain- tops: hence such names as Mont-Mercure in the Vendée, and Merkur near Baden- Baden. Like the Roman model, this god too has the caduceus as attribute, and in his hand he holds a purse. His sacred animals are the cock, the tortoise and the ram. In the area round the Mosel and the Rhine he was depicted along with → Rosmerta. Whether this Gallic god shares certain individual traits with → Teutates or is identical with him, is a moot point.

Meret (Mert) Ancient Egyptian god- dess of song and rejoicing. As ‘Queen of the treasury’ she is often depicted stand- ing on the hieroglyph for ‘gold’. She appears also in double form as Meret of Upper and of Lower Egypt. Mesaru → M ama m Mesenet In ancient Egypt, the person- ification of the ‘birth-tile’ on which the mother giving birth crouched.

Mikal A Phoenician god revered on Cyprus, in function perhaps a god of plague and pestilence. Milkom The chief god of the Ammonites who live in east Jordan. The name probably derives from the Semitic word for ‘king’ ( milk, melek , cf. also → Malik).

Mi-lo Fo (also called Pu-Sa) The Chinese name of the Bodhisattva → Maitreya, who is to make his appearance at the end of time. He is represented as a plump monk, with a happy laughing face, in a crouching posture; in his hands he holds a wreath of roses and a purse.

As Minerva Medica she was the tutelary god- dess of doctors and had a shrine on the Esquiline. As tutelary goddess of Rome she had her main temple on the Aventine. She was later equated with the Greek goddess → Athená. Minerva, Gallic Caesar mentions this goddess of handicrafts ( operum ) and arts ( artificiorum ). Her Celtic name is unknown. Many inscriptions have been found dedicated to her, and in these she is often given the epithet Belisama (Celtic bel \u0001 shining, resplendent). As a rule, she is portrayed as armed. She also appeared as medica , i.e. as a physician, and in this capacity her cult was connected with medicinal springs. Her counterpart among the ancient Irish was → Brigit.

Among his attributes is a plot with let- tuce plants (as an aphrodisiac!). As the local deity of Koptos he became tutelary god of the desert roads. One of his epithets was Kamutef, i.e. ‘bull of his mother’ in token of his auto-generation.

In the course of Zarathustra’s reforms he was ousted by → Ahura Mazda from his hitherto predomi- nant position; but in the fourth century BC he made a vigorous come-back as a cult figure, though Zoroastrian circles contin- ued to ignore him. The Avesta tells us that Mithra has 10,000 ears and eyes; he rides in a chariot drawn by white horses. He causes the rain to fall and the plants to grow. In the post-Alexandrine period in Asia Minor Mithra took on traits of → Apóllon and of → Hélios, thereby tending more and more to the sun-god type. Cf. Mithras. Mithras intensified until he appeared as the figure of Sol invictus , the ‘invincible sun’. In late antiquity, the universal appeal of this god shows itself in a number of symbioses with other gods (Mercurius, Zeus, Serapis). Mitra The Vedic god of friendship and of contracts. While → Va r u j a ruled the night and received dark sacrifices, Mitra ruled the day and received white sacri- fices. He is one of the → A dityas, and figures generally in the late Vedic period as a friendly god. In Iran, he is paralleled by → Mithra. Mixcoatl (‘cloud-snake’) A manifesta- tion of the Aztec god → Tezcatlipoca, the form he adopted when he made the first fire: as boringstick he used the rotating fir- mament held in place by its two poles.

Mog Ruith An Irish god, who rides in a chariot of bright bronze, or flies through the air like a bird. The ruith component in the name may be connected with the word roth \u0001 wheel, thus indicating a solar trait in the god. One tradition makes him out to have lost an eye. Moires (Moirai; Greek moira \u0001 portion, share) Originally, man’s allotted ‘por- tions’ in life, his share of fate; thereafter, the three goddesses of fate, Klotho (the spinner) who spins the thread of life, Lachesis, who sustains it through all con- tingencies, and Atropos (‘the inevitable’) who cuts it through and thereby brings death.

The cult excluded women, and its rit- uals were held by night in underground rooms ( mithraea sing. mithraeum ).

Moloch This is a Greek transcription of the Hebrew Molek – the name of a Canaanite god, to whom human sacrifice (of children) was originally made. Many Israelites consecrated their children to Moloch by throwing them into the flames (2 Kings 23: 10). Lately, the name Moloch has been compared with the Punic root MLK \u0001 offering, sacrifice; if a connection can be established, this would suggest that Moloch was not a god but rather a particular form of sacrifice. Moma The Uitoto Indians in South America believe in Moma as their creator and primeval father. When he was slain, death entered the world. Since then, Moma has ruled the underworld, which is in keeping with the lunar characteristics also ascribed to him. Momos In Greek religion the personi- fication of blame, censure. Hesiod describes Momos as one of the sons of night ( → Nyx). Mon In the religious system of the Kafirs in eastern Afghanistan, the first divine creation of → Imra.

Morta → Parcae Mot (Semitic mawt, mot \u0001 death) Phoenician god of drought, of infertility and death. He is lord of the underworld, the ‘charnel-house of earth’. Mot is adversary of → Baal, whom he slays. The goddess → Anat thereupon travels to the underworld, and cuts Mot to pieces with a sword, which leads to the resurrection of Baal. It is probable that Philon of Byblos had Mot in mind when he writes of a god ‘Muth’ whom the Phoenicians call ‘death’. dMu (also written as rMu) In the Bon religion of ancient Tibet, equivalent to → Lha.

Mulungu (often as Mungu) The supreme god of various East African tribes, e.g. the Kamba. His epithet is mumbi , i.e. ‘creator’. Etymologically, the name Mulungu is connected with Bantu words meaning ‘ancestral domain’ or ‘ancestral soul’. It is probable that in origin Mulungu figured as ancestral chief or progenitor. Mummu The adviser of the old Mesopotamian primeval god → Apsu. Both were overcome by → Ea, who stripped Mummu of his radiance, thereby appropriating his being for himself. Mundilferi → Mani Muruk a n Ancient Dravidian deity, whose name means ‘the youthful one’. He is also known as C e y o n (‘the red one’).

Another divine Nana is also known to us – the daughter of the river-god → Sangarios in Asia Minor.

Then he caused sand and water to mate, and from the union came forth 132 Nana"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Nareau the Younger. The latter conquered darkness by forming the sun and the moon from his father’s eyes; from the flesh he created rocks and stones, and from the backbone the ‘tree of the fore- fathers’, from which came the ancestors of the human race. Nari Among the Slavs, demonic beings who seem to have been in origin the souls of dead children. The Bulgarians imagine them in the shape of birds. In the Ukraine they are reckoned as belonging to the domestic goblins. Narisah The Manichaean ‘god of the world of light’, the father of the twelve ‘light-virgins’ (dominion, wisdom, vic- tory, conviction, purity, truth, belief, patience, uprightness, kindness, justice and light), corresponding to the twelve signs of the Zodiac. Narisah may also appear as ‘virgin of light’, and is then essentially androgynous. Narkissos (Latin Narcissus) Son of the Greek river-god Kephissos and the → Naiad Leirope. In unrequited love for his own image reflected in the water, he wasted away until he was transformed into the flower which now bears his name. Nasr (also Nusur) Ancient Arabian god whose name means ‘eagle’. Apart from this, little is known about him. Natha (Sinhala \u0001 protector, master) One of the four chief gods of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), equated with the Bodhisattva → Avalokite f vara: subsequently also identi- fied as the future Buddha → Maitreya. The Buddhist goddess → T a r a is supposed to be his spouse. Naunet In the ancient Egyptian cos- mogony of Hermopolis, Naunet belongs to the → Ogdoad, and is the female coun- terpart of → Nun, the personification of the primeval deep. In old religious texts Naunet figures as an underworld comple- ment to heaven ( → Nut), thus becoming a kind of counter-heaven which the sun traverses during the night. Ndjambi Sky-god of the Herero peo- ple in south-west Africa, the source of all good deeds. Whoever dies a natural death is borne aloft by him. It is not permissible to utter his name except on certain very special occasions. Nebtuu (Nebetu \u0001 ‘queen of the fields’) A local goddess venerated together with → Chnum in Esneh, the ancient Latopolis. Nechbet Nechmetawaj 133 Upper Egyptian tutelary goddess of the monarch, represented as a woman with a vulture’s skin on her head, or as a vulture. Her attributes are the rod of authority and the eternity symbol. Her sacred creature, the vulture, became symbolical for the whole of Upper Egypt, and entered the Pharaonic regalia together with the snake representing Lower Egypt ( → Uto). In popular belief in the days of the New Kingdom and later Nechbet was revered as a goddess of birh. Nechmetawaj (Nehmet-awai) An ancient Egyptian goddess venerated in"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Hermopolis. Her name means ‘she who takes the part of the robbed’. She is the female counterpart of → Thot, who is of course a protector of justice: their son is → Neferhor. At a later date, the goddess merged with → Hathor. Plutarch men- tions her under the name of Dikaiosyne. Neferhor (Greek form Nephoros or Nopheros) Ancient Egyptian god, forming a triad with → Nechmetawaj and → Thot. The name means ‘he who is fair of face’. Nefertem (Greek form Nephthemis) Ancient Egyptian god of sweet savour: actually, the deified lotus flower which he bears on his head or carries in his hand in his anthropomorphic guise. In one Pyramid text he is described as the ‘lotus- bloom on the nose of Re’. In his solar aspect, Nefertem himself becomes the sun-child on the lotus blossom, and the victorious god of light. He is often shown with a lion’s head: after all, his mother → Sachmet was a lion-goddess. Nehalennia A Germanic goddess, evidence of whose cult has been found in the Low Countries. It is not clear what her name means: and it has been variously suggested that the references to her iden- tify her as a goddess of fertility or as a goddess of the dead. Altars dedicated to her show her with fruit (or a basket of fruit) and a dog; often the bows of a ship appear which may show her in another light, as a tutelary goddess of seafarers. Nehebkau A snake-demon in ancient Egyptian belief. He serves the sun-god, whom he accompanies in his barque; and he is a kind of watchman at the entrance to the beyond. Finally, he assumes the stature of a primeval god, and becomes, as lord of (everlasting) time, the hope of the dead. Neith (‘the terrible one’) This is the Greek transliteration of the name of the local goddess of Sais, the consonants of which are N.t. She was essentially a god- dess of war: her cult symbol which she bears on her head consists of a pair of crossed arrows, often with a shield as well. Her epithet is ‘she who opens up the ways’, indicating that she marches ahead of the monarch and his army. The location of her cult – in the delta of the Nile – explains her close relationship with the crocodile-god → Suchos, who is described as her son. Sometimes Neith appears as a primeval goddess, who may even have androgynous features. She is a goddess of the dead along with → Isis, → Nephthys and → Selket. Nemesis A Greek goddess who saw to it that justice and luck were evenly dis- tributed in human life and who meted out due punishment for misdeeds and arro- gance ( hubris ). The name is connected with the root nemein in the sense of ‘apportionment of what is proper, due’. The cult of Nemesis centred round Rhamnus in Attica and in Smyrna. In the Hellenistic period, Nemesis was regarded as the goddess of the agone (sporting competitions of all sorts) and under the Roman Empire she was honoured in amphitheatres and at racecourses. Nemetona A Celtic goddess, who was often coupled with the Gallic → Mars. Her name is derived from the word nemton \u0001 shrine, sanctum, and means something like ‘she who is revered in the shrine’. Nenun (Nenwen) Ancient Egyptian local god of Kus. He was a falcon-god, later equated with Haroeris. Neper This old Egyptian word means ‘corn, grain’, and it is also the name of the god personifying grains. He is regarded as the son of the ‘food-snake’ → Renenutet, and offers hope to the dead as ‘he who lives, after he has died’. 134 Neferhor"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Nephthys (Nebthut: her name in hiero- glyphic consonantal spelling is Nb.t-hw.t \u0001 ‘mistress of the house’) Ancient Egyptian goddess, who seems to be asso- ciated with → Seth, but who is function- ally on the side of → Osiris, whose corpse she guards together with her sister → Isis. In this way, she becomes a goddess of the dead. Nephthys and Isis are of the east and they receive the rising sun. Nepit The female counterpart of the ancient Egyptian corn-god → Neper. She is usually shown in human form, carrying a sheaf of corn on her head; but some- times she appears in the form of a snake. Neptunus (Neptune) Old Italic god of flowing water. The people celebrated his feast (the Neptunalia) on 23 July, the aim being probably to ward off the high sum- mer drought. Neptune was equated with the Greek sea-god → Poseidon, and he was, in addition, the god of race-courses. Nereids The fifty daughters of the Greek sea-god Nereus. As → Nymphs dwelling in the sea they form the retinue of → Poseidon. Two of them, → Amphitríte and → Thetis, deserve special mention. The Nereids live on in the Greek mind today as gentle fairies. Nereus The Greek god of water, espe- cially of the sea; the son of → Pontos and the earth-goddess → Gaia, and father of the → Nereids. Like other sea-gods, he has the gift of prophecy, and is able to change his appearance at will. Nergal (Sumerian, Nerigal) An ancient Mesopotamian god of the underworld, the husband of → Ere m kigal. He was particu- larly venerated in the city of Kuthu, whose name, significantly, served as a synonym for the realm of the dead. Other names given to the god were Lugalgirra and → Meslamta’ea. In origin, Nergal was an earth-god incorporating the burning heat of summer, and who brought fever and pestilence to human beings. Nerthus The Roman historian Tacitus records the existence of this Germanic goddess, whom he calls Mater Terra, ‘mother earth’. Archaeological and toponymical evidence suggests that her cult was mainly centred in Denmark. She is described as travelling through the land in a wagon drawn by cows and covered by a cloth; when she returns to her shrine, the wagon and the cloth, and even her image, are washed in a sacred lake. In Norway and Sweden, Nerthus is transformed into the figure of the male → Njörd. It is likely that both Nerthus and Njörd are later versions of an originally androgynous fertility deity. Nethuns The Etruscan god of water, especially of wells and springs, later of the sea also. The name corresponds to the Latin → Neptunus. Like Neptune, Nethuns is shown as naked and bearded, with a wreath of leaves in his hair. Neto(n) An ancient Hispanic war-god with astral character. The name is proba- bly connected with the Celtic word neto \u0001 warrior. Ngai The supreme god of the Masai people in East Africa. The name means ‘rain’ and indicates that Ngai was origi- nally seen as a weather-god. When a male Masai dies, Ngai is invoked as follows: ‘Oh god, I pray, give health, give posses- sions, give children.’ Ngai is also revered as supreme god by the Bantu Kikuyu peo- ple: he lives in heaven, and lightning is visible evidence of his presence. Niamye The supreme god of the Baule people in the Ivory Coast. He was born from the mother of the gods. The first thing he did was to create a wife for himself, and then he turned his hand to creating men and animals.

As his name suggests (‘Master physician’) he is a god of healing. Ningal (Sumerian \u0001 ‘great queen’) The wife of the ancient Mesopotamian moon-god ( → Nanna or → Sin), and mother of the sun-god. She appears in Syria under the name of Nikkal. Ningirsu (‘lord of Girsu’) A Sumerian god belonging to the Laga m pantheon, the husband of → Baba. He is probably iden- tical with → Ninurta, and like the latter he appears in two distinct functions: he is first a god of fertility and vegetation, and in this function his epithet is ‘lord of the ploughland’; second, he has a military side and strikes terror into foreign lands. His symbolical animal is the lion-headed eagle Imdugud. Ningi y zida (Ningizida, ‘lord of the right tree’) Chthonic god of the Sumerians. His symbolical creature is the horned snake. According to Akkadian incanta- tions, he watches over the demons who have been exiled to the underworld; while other traditions present him rather as a god of healing, akin to his father → Ninazu. Finally, he also figures as custo- dian at the entrance into heaven. Ningyo A mermaid in Japanese popu- lar belief. She has a human torso and a fish’s tail. She wards off misfortune and preserves peace in the land. Nin h ursanga (Sumerian \u0001 ‘queen of the mountains’) A mother-goddess: many Mesopotamian rulers – e.g. Hammurabi and Nebucadnezzar – called themselves ‘children of Nin l ursanga’. Ninigi → Takamimusubi Nin’insina The Sumerian local god- dess of Isin; in the Babylonian period she acted as a goddess of healing. At times, identified with → Inanna. 136 Nidhöggr Greek goddess mentioned first in Hesiod. She is the personification of victory which is given by → Zeus or by → Athená. She is mostly portrayed as a winged messenger of the gods, with lau- rel wreath, girdle and palm-leaf. Her Roman counterpart is → Victoria.

Ninurta is probably identical with the → Ningirsu worshipped in Laga m . Nira h Old Mesopotamian god who incorporates the snake in its apotropaic aspect. He is represented as a snake on Babylonian border-markers. Nirrta → Nirrti Nirrti (Nirriti \u0001 annihilation) Indian goddess of destruction, who threatens both living and dead. In sacrificial ritual, she is allotted the colour of black, and her messenger is the dove. Her husband is Nirrta (Nirrita) who is lord of the south- west precinct. Nisaba Sumerian goddess of the art of writing and of knowledge, daughter of the sky-god → An. She ‘opens men’s ears’, i.e. she gives them understanding. As in the case of → Nabu, her emblem is the writing-stylus. In origin, Nisaba was a corn goddess. Nixe (Water-sprite) (Old High German nihhus \u0001 crocodile; related to Sanskrit nijanas ‘washing oneself ’) The male Nix (Nicker) was originally a water-monster of an animal nature, regarded as mali- cious and dangerous. In Sweden, it is known as Näck. The female Nixe is a water-sprite with a human torso and the tail of a fish. There are similar beings in the folklore of many nations: cf. the → Rusalka of the Slavs and the → Ningyo of the Japanese. Njörd A Germanic god, descended from the → Vanir but resident with the Aesir ( → As) until the end of the world. He rules over wind, sea and fire. He is enormously rich, gives the peasants good harvests and helps the fishermen to land good catches: that is to say, he behaves as a god of fertility. In west Norway, Njörd was especially venerated as a god of the sea. His children are → Freyr and → Freyja. His female counterpart is → Nerthus, whose name is an allomorph of his. Nommo In the cosmogony of the Dogon people in west Africa, a designa- tion for primeval beings who existed along with the creator god → Amma.

Nommo 137"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Nona A Roman goddess of birth, so-called because of the nine-month term of pregnancy. Norns (Old Norse norn \u0001 she who whis- pers) In Germanic mythology, spae- wives who determine a person’s fate on earth the moment he or she is born; like the → Disir, they also play a part in the actual process of birth. To begin with, there seems to have been a plurality of Norns, but in the end they were reduced to a triad, perhaps under the influence of the → Parcae. In the Völuspa they are named as Urd, Verdandi and Skuld: that is to say, the past, the pre- sent and the future, or what has been, what is and what will be. The thread of fate which the Norns are spinning is only occa- sionally mentioned. In essence, the Norns are closely related to the → Valkyries. Nortia Etruscan goddess of fate and fortune. Her attribute is often a large nail. In her temple at Volsini it was the custom to hammer in a nail at New Year; this may have been a sort of expiation rite – the nailing down of the defunct year – or it may have symbolized good wishes for the coming one. Notos Greek god representing the south wind. Like his brothers → Boréas, → Euros and → Zéphyros, he is a son of the morning red ( → Eos). His Roman equivalent is Auster.

She formed the first human beings out of yellow clay, and she invented the flute. Like the mythical cul- tural hero → Fu-xi, Nü-gua is depicted with reptilian lower half. Num Sky-god and supreme deity of the Samojedic people; the word num also denotes the visible sky. The god is the cre- ator of the sun, moon and earth, but he delegates the running of the world thus ordered to inferior deities. His epithet jilibeambaertje identifies him as the pro- tector of herds and flocks. Reindeer are sacrificed to him and hung up on trees or poles. Num-Torum Sky-god of the Mansi (Vogul) people: he lives in a resplendent golden house in the seventh heaven, with an iron (or silver) pillar in front of the door which signifies the axis mundi . The bear is closely associated with Num- Torum, and bears are regarded as the god’s children. Nun Ancient Egyptian god, the personi- fication of the primeval deep, the waters from which all that is has arisen. Like the ocean, he embraces the earth, but is at the same time underneath it. As the primeval god who was existent in the time of Chaos, he bears the epithet ‘father of the gods’. On occasion he is represented – like the other male gods of the → Ogdoad – with a frog’s head. His female counterpart is → Naunet. Nusku Old Mesopotamian god of light and fire, the son of → Enlil, and father of the fire-god → Gibil. He is the enemy of witches and demons.

In the evening, she swallows the sun in the west, only to eject it next morning in renewed vigour in the east. She is the ‘sow who eats up her piglets’ – that is to say, she subsumes all the heavenly bodies in her own being. In the Egyptian cult of the dead, she is connected with the concept of resurrection; and the coffin is regarded as the symbol of heaven, indeed of Nut her- self, from whom the dead awaken to new life. In art, she is shown being raised by the god of the air, → M u, above the earth- god → Geb. Nyama (Bantu \u0001 animal, game, fish) A designation for a class of wild animal which is rich in magic power, and which incorporates a force which is partly spiri- tual and partly physical. The word can be used to denote spiritual powers (e.g., the capacity of a dead person to avenge him- self, to take reprisals); and among the Mandingo it is a circumlocution for certain deities. Nyame The supreme being of the Akan (in the south of Ghana). It is Nyame who sends the soul into the embryo, and who determines individual destiny. Temples are erected to him, in which priests spend their lives in his service. His sacred number is five. His male aspect appears in the sun, his female aspect in the moon. Being essentially androgynous, Nyame can also appear as a goddess. He corresponds to → Niamye of the Baule. gNyan Tibetan spirits who live in trees and stones, and who can send illnesses (especially plague and pestilence) and death to man. As they move about in the mountains as well, they are considered to be close to the gods. Nymphs (Greek nymphe \u0001 young woman) For the Greeks, these were female nature deities of a lower order than gods; but they were sometimes regarded as demons also, especially when accom- panied by satyrs and → Silene as their male partners. They dwelt in the moun- tains and in caves ( oreades ), in the sea ( → Nereids), in springs and pools ( → Naiads) and in trees ( → Dryads). In Greek myth they are called ‘daughters of Zeus’, and in popular belief they were regarded as conferring fertility. As a rule, they appeared in groups, often in the ret- inue of → Dionysos and sometimes led by → Hérmes, whose own mother was a nymph ( → Maía). In the Hellenistic- Roman period they were regarded mainly as water-spirits, and duly represented with water-pot or mussel shell. The build- ing concerned with the provision of water in a Greek city was called the numphaion (Latin nymphaeum ). Nyrckes Nyrckes figures on an old Finnish list of gods as the one who gives ‘squirrels from the forest’. In magic for- mulae used by hunters he appears as lord of the forest animals, and as the son – but sometimes the wife (!)- of the forest god → Tapio.

Odin to achieve wisdom he sacrificed one of his eyes. In saga and in popular belief he appears as a one-eyed warrior armed with a spear, or as a wanderer in a blue mantle with a floppy hat. Finally, he is also the leader of the ‘wild army’ of peregrinating souls. One of his epithets is Grimnir (‘the masked one’) – this because of his fond- ness for changing his outward shape (e.g. into eagle or snake) and for disguises. Other specific epithets are Hangagud (‘god of the hanged’) and Bölverkr (‘harm-bringer’). In Scandinavia and in England, the third day of the week is called after him – English Wednesday. In the myth, Odin is swallowed by → Fenrir at Ragnarök, the destruction of the world. Early medieval bracteates show the god threatened by a monster; he is accompa- nied by two birds and sometimes by a deer as well, as in our illustration. Odqan Mongolian fire-spirit.

As cosmic gods they are represented in anthropomor- phic form; individually they also appear as apes who are seen greeting the rising sun (a symbol for the creation of the world). They are also sometimes conceived as chthonic animals, the male gods appearing as frogs, the female ones as snakes. Ogma Chief god of the Irish pantheon. In the battle against the demonic → Fomore, he is able to take their king’s sword away from him. One of his epithets is ‘he whose visage is like the sun’. One of his most signal achievements was to invent the Og(h)am script which is used in the oldest texts in the Irish language. Ogmios A Gallic god, corresponding, as his name suggests, to the Irish → Ogma. Lukianos (second century AD) equated him with → Heraklés. Bald- headed and wrinkled, carrying a bow and a club, he is supposed to symbolize the power of speech.

Olifat (other forms of the name are Olafat or Yelafath) In the belief of the Caroline Islanders, a superhuman figure, part culture-hero, part rogue. His father was the sky-god, his mother was a mortal woman. On the one hand, he gave mankind fire – but on the other, he gave the shark its teeth so that it could eat men. Olmai (Olmay) Among the Lapps, this word denotes divine properties: thus, biegg-olmai is the wind-god, and → waralden olmai is a god of universal significance. Olokun In Yoruba cosmogony, the god of wealth and of the sea. He is often to be seen on Benin bronzes; he has legs like fish, and in each hand he holds a lizard. In days gone by, human sacrifice was made to Olokun, it is said, to placate the anger of the god. Among the Ika Ibo, Olokun was worshipped in the form of a water- jug.

He is the originator of all things: according to one tradition, indeed, he thought himself up. His Maya counterpart is → Hunab Ku. Omichle → Pothos Onuris The Greek form of the god Anhuret, worshipped in the Upper Egyptian city of This (Thinis). The name Anhuret means something like ‘he who brings the faraway’.

Horus took over the royal inheritance of Osiris, while the latter acts as regent and judge in the realm of the dead, and causes the plants to sprout forth from the surface of the earth. This shows him as a fertility god, an aspect which is underlined by his connection with the annual flooding of the Nile. As the ‘eternally good being’ he appears under the name of Wennofer. As lord of the under- world, Osiris represents the sun in its noc- turnal transit.

Orpheus The son of the Thracian river-god Oiagros and the Muse → Kalliópe. Apóllon is often said to be his father. Orpheus can charm plants and animals with his singing and his luteplaying. When his wife Eurydice died, he moved the gods of the under- world so deeply with his singing that they restored her to him – but she had to go back to the underworld again because Orpheus disobeyed the com- mand of the gods and looked round at her .Later, he was torn to pieces by Thracian Maenads and interred by the → Muses.

In Tibet, he is said to have changed many demons into → Dharmap a las. Padv a xtag → Xr om tag Pajainen In the Finnish myth of the slaughter of the great bull (or pig), this is the god who figures as the slaughterer.

He was represented with the horns and legs of a billy-goat, and it is in the guise of a randy goat that we see the mythical Pan pursu- ing → Nymphs. One of them, called Syrinx, changed herself into a reed to escape his clutches – so Pan cut several reeds and made himself the pan-pipes ( syrinx ). He had a habit of appearing out of the blue, especially in the hush of the noonday heat, and this caused panic among men and animals. The tale that Plutarch tells about the death of Pan shows that he was a vegetation-god.

P a ndar a (‘the white one’) A Buddhist goddess, the partner ( prajñ a ) of → Amit a bha. Her element is fire and the passion of love. Iconographically, she appears in various forms. Pandora Created by → Hephaistos at the behest of → Zeus, and equipped with every seductive gift, she was despatched to earth as the first woman. With her she had a box (really a barrel: in Greek pithos ) containing sorrow and misfortune. It is possible that she is a later version of an ancient earth-goddess, as the name, which means ‘she who gives all’ or ‘she who is rich in gifts’ has been applied to such a goddess also. Panku Papas 147 (Pan-gu) A primeval giant in Chinese mythology. He was born from the five basic elements, and he used a hammer and chisel to form the heaven and the earth. According to another version of the myth, Pan-gu arose from the world-egg in which yin and yang were as yet undivided; and from these components he formed the earth ( yin ) and the heavens ( yang ). After the death of the giant, the sun arose from his left eye, the moon from his right eye, the rain from his sweat; his flesh decom- posed and fell apart to form the arable land, and the plants grew from his hairs.

Pa q upati (‘Lord of cattle’) Seals belonging to the ancient Indus cultures show this ithyphallic deity seated in the Yoga posture, surrounded by animals (especially snakes as symbols of fertility). In the Veda, Pa f upati is one of the names of → Rudra; later, the name was used for → F iva in his aspect as a god of fertility. Pa f u not only means ‘cattle’, ‘beasts’, but is also a designation for the soul; as ‘Lord of the soul’ the god leads his devotees to the ‘end of sorrow’, that is, to liberation.

These were supposed to be mainly a form of protection against wild animals, and images of them were worn as amulets round the neck to ward off evil. They were called the ‘sons of → Ptah’. The youthful Ptah could himself figure as a Patek; and, imported in this guise from Egypt, he was a popular figure in Carthage. Pattini The most important female deity of the Singhalese. She watches over marriage and keeps epidemics at bay; and she is said to have brought the cultivation of rice into Ceylon. The myth tells how she was born from a mango which had been struck by a divine arrow. ‘Fire-walking’ is a practice bound up with her cult. Pax Roman goddess of peace, equated with the Greek → Eirene.

Traditionally, she came originally from Kahiki (Tahiti), expelled by her divine brothers who could no longer put up with her insubordination.

Pellonpekko Finnish god of barley; his name comes from pelto \u0001 field. To him is due the first beer brewed from barley. In Estonia, Peko is a corn-god, a waxen image of whom is kept in the corn- chest. St Peter is called Pekka in Finnish, and it was on St Peter’s day that the festive beer used to be brewed; taken together, these points suggest Christian influence. Pemba (Bemba) Creator-god of the Bambara in West Africa. When he was let down by the world-spirit → Yo on to the earth, a tree grew out of him, under which the humans who had been created by → Faro, sought refuge.

The old beliefs linger on in the Perchten processions with their grotesque demonic disguises. Perendi Old Illyrian name for God, related to the Lithuanian → Perkunas, the god of thunder, and the Greek word keraunos \u0001 lightning. That is to say, Perendi was a storm-god.

On the way back to Seriphos, he rescued Andromeda from a sea-monster. Perun A Slavonic god of thunder, especially venerated in old Russia. His name is taken to mean ‘striker’; the Polish word piorun means ‘thunder’. Among the images of gods erected at Kiev, Perun was shown with a club as attribute.

Whether Perun is etymologically connected with the Lithuanian word → Perkunas is not certain. Petbe Old Egyptian god of retaliation, whose cult was known in the Ptolemaic- Roman period.

Phaéthon (‘the shining one’) The son of the Greek sun-god → Hélios, who once allowed him to drive the sun-chariot. But Phaéthon was too weak to control the fiery solar steeds: he came too close to the earth and caused a terrible fire. Whereupon → Zeus hurled him in a flash of lightning into a stream, on whose banks his grieving sis- ters, the Heliades, were transformed into trees which drip amber tears.

It is uncertain whether Pinikir corresponds to the Kiri mm a who is often mentioned in invoca- tions to the gods. Pirwa (Peruwa) A Hittite deity, whose name is derived from peruna \u0001 cliff. An associated epithet is ‘queen’, but other- wise the deity is considered to be male. His attribute is the horse.

Poseidon Poseidon 153 Greek sea-god, the son of → Kronos and of → Rhea. The name is already attested in Mycenaean times, but the etymological meaning is not clear. In Homer, he rates as one of the most powerful gods along with the lord of heaven → Zeus, and the god of the underworld → Hades. He sends storms and earthquakes, but he may also favour the traveller with a good voy- age. In origin, Poseidon was possibly an old fertility god, in the shape of a horse, and venerated as the patron of horse- breeding; later on, the horse figured as his sacred animal, and in Corinth horse-races were held in his honour.

According to Philon of Byblos, Pothos moved as a ‘dark’ wind over the face of Chaos, and impregnated himself. Prahlada → Daityas Praj a pati (‘Lord of the creatures’) In the Rigveda, the name of the divine cre- ator of the world. In the Atharvaveda he is said to be the creator of heaven and earth. The world arises as an emanation from his inexhaustible being. His function as a progenitor is underlined in the Mah a bh a rata where he appears as pro- tective lord of the sexual organ. Occasionally, he takes the place of → Va r u j a, whose sacred animal, the tor- toise, can be one of the forms Praj a pati may assume. In Hinduism, Praj a pati is understood as one of the names of the god → Brahman. Prajñ a In Buddhism, the female principle: on the spiritual way, it is the intuition which complements the male technique of meditation. The meaning of the word prajñ a is ‘wisdom’ or ‘insight’. The law of polarity specifies that prajñ a can be paired with certain male partners as their necessary complement. The personified prajñ a s form the passive components in this partnership; and accordingly, in iconographic representa- tion, they are always shown smaller than the god so complemented. When both are shown in the Yabyum position, the polarity is integrated. Prajñ a p a ramit a (Perfection of insight) The personification of a text of the same name, in which → Gautama Buddha is supposed to have set out his teaching. As a female deity she figures in iconography from India to south-east Asia and Java, hardly changing in appearance and usu- ally equipped with the text in question.

Preas Eyssaur A god of the Khmer people; he is a destructive god, but from death he engenders new life, and in this he corresponds to the Indian → F iva. The upright stone pillar which the ancient Khmer kings adopted as the symbol of their authority is, in fact, a version of the linga symbol, characteristic of F iva. Preas Prohm A mythical primeval god of the Khmer, himself uncreated but con- taining within himself all power.

Priapos A Phrygian god of fertility, of gardens, bees, goats and sheep. In Greece, he was unknown until the Macedonian hegemony, and his cult never assumed sig- nificant proportions, either in Greece or in Rome. His father was said to be → Dionysos, and his mother → Aphrodíte, the goddess of love. His cult was most honoured in Asia Minor, and in Lampsakos, on the Hellespont, he is even supposed to have been the most important figure in their pantheon. He was represented as an ugly, satyr-like man with exaggerated genitals. Priapos played a second part too, as the patron of fishermen and sailors. Pri q ni → Maruts Prithiv i (‘the wide (earth)’) In India, the earth, felt as a mother and symbolized in the form of the cow; in Vedism, revered together with the god of heaven → Dyaus.

Prometheus (‘he who thinks things out in advance’) The son of the Titan → Iapetos, who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. As a punishment, he was chained to a rock in the Caucasus, and an eagle fed daily on his liver, which was self-restoring. Finally he was released by → Heraklés. Prometheus was a culture- hero who brought man not only fire but also handicrafts and art, and he was revered in Athens as the patron of crafts- men, particularly potters. One tradition makes him out to be the actual creator of the human race, as he formed men and women from clay and water. Proteus A divine ‘old man of the sea’ in Greek mythology.

Saule herself was thought of as dwelling on her farm or estate on top of the moun- tain of heaven, and she was invoked in prayer to foster the fruits of the earth. Among the Lithuanians, Saule (the sun) figures less prominently as a deity, having been set in heaven by the divine smith; but here too we find the tradition that sun and moon ( → Menulis) form a conjugal couple. Saules meitas These were the ‘daugh- ters of the sun’ in ancient Latvian mythol- ogy, and are often mentioned together with the → Dieva d e li. While the daugh- ters of the sun sow roses, the sons of the sky-god strew golden dew.

She is portrayed wearing the cap normally reserved for male deities, and a slit skirt which leaves her legs free. Wings sprout from her back. Her sacred animal is the lion. M au m ka’s reputation as a goddess of healing reached as far afield as Egypt.

He drives in a golden chariot and has golden arms which reach to the frontiers of heaven: in other words, a solar god. Saxnot (‘sword-companion’: cf. Old High German sahs \u0001 knife, sword) Originally, the tribal god of the Saxons, who is mentioned in an old Low German manuscript along with Donar and Wodan ( → Odin). He is probably a local form of → Ty r. Sebettu (Akkadian \u0001 the seven) Designation of a group of demons, some benign, others malignant. The seven malevolent demons are in fact the prog- eny of the sky-god → An, but that does not prevent them from helping the plague-god → Erra; they also encircle the moon, thereby causing an eclipse. The benign seven appear as adversaries of these malignant spirits. Sebettu was also the Akkadian name for the Pleiades.

Semele In origin, Semele was proba- bly a Thracian-Phrygian earth-goddess. In Greek myth she appears as the daughter of the Theban king Kadmos. When → Zeus, who was wooing her, revealed him- self to her in all his divine majesty, she was burnt by the lightning emanating from him.

The horse, the antelope, the pig, the hippopotamus and the crocodile were regarded as sacred to Seth.

He was portrayed as a peasant, either naked or clad in a tunic tucked up round his legs; in his long hair he wears a wreath of pine twigs, and he has a goat- skin over his shoulders.

In this, they are close to the old demons of death like the → Harpies; and they were often represented on funer- ary monuments as symbolic figures of mourning.

His rather more haphazard attributes are a club and a purse, reminiscent of figures like → Heraklés and → Mercurius. Often he holds in his hand a vase or a drinking- bowl ( olla ), which may be symbols of plenty and which may identify him as a god of fertility.

As a represen- tative of the unpredictable way of the world, Tyché became particularly popular at the time of the Sophists, when belief in other gods was at a low ebb. Several Hellenistic towns, such as Antiochia on the Orontes, chose Tyché as their tutelary goddess. In art she is shown with a helms- man’s rudder (as director of fate) and cor- nucopia (as bringer of good fortune). The wheel and the globe point to inconstancy and transitoriness. Her Roman counter- part was → Fortuna. Typhón (Typhoeus) The progeny of the underworld (Tartaros) and the earth ( → Gaia). A monster with a hundred dragon- heads and snake’s feet. From his union with → Echidna came → Kerberos, → Ladon and the Chimaira. The name Typhón (or Typhos) means ‘whirlwind’, and later the giant was taken to be a demon which causes storms and earthquakes. Tyr The original form was Tiwaz, Anglo-Saxon Tiw, Old High German Ziu, cognate with Greek → Zeus. To begin with, a sky-god of the early Germanic peoples, till he was ousted by → Odin. The Romans were quick to identify him as a god of war, and the week-day dedi- cated to Mars became Ziu’s day (Tuesday; Alemannic Zischdi). Tyr/Ziu was not only god of war but also of justice, and his spear was an emblem of judicial authority as well as being a weapon. At Ragnarök the god falls in battle with → Garm.

In Karelia and in Ingermanland, the prophet Elias (Elijah) takes the place of Ukko. Ülgän The sky-god of the Altai Tatars. He it is who sends the saviour Maidere to earth, to teach men to respect and fear the true god, but Maidere is slain by the evil → Erlik.

Ull(r) A north Germanic god, whose name may be connected with the Gothic word wulthus \u0001 splendour. He is closely associated with the administration of jus- tice (oaths were sworn over his ring) and he was invoked for protection in duels. He was reckoned to be a skilful archer and skier. On the one hand he has all the traits of a god of winter, but on the other he is connected with the forces of fertility, and in place-names his name is more often than not combined with words meaning ‘field’, ‘meadow’, etc. In myth, Ull is the son of → Sif and the stepson of → Thor. Ullikummi Ancient Anatolian demon, created by the dethroned king of the gods → Kumarbi, by making a stone pregnant, in order to help him to get back his king- dom in heaven.

It may also represent the rainbow. Medicine-men believe that their erect penis is identical with Ungud. Uni Etruscan goddess, corresponding in terms of Greek myth to → Hera, and accordingly allocated to the sky-god → Tin. In addition, she was the tutelary god- dess of Perugia. It is probable that the name Uni is not Etruscan, but connected with the Italic-Latin name Iuno ( → Juno).

He and his wife of the same name (together forming an androgynous unity?) then generated the first human beings. Unumbotte A mythical god of the Bassari people who live in Togo. He first created human beings, and then the animals. Unut A goddess in the form of a hare who was worshipped in the fifteenth nome of Upper Egypt (Hermopolis).

Upuaut (Wep-wawet; the Greek tran- scription is Ophois) Ancient Egyptian god of Siut, in the form of a black jackal or wolf. The name means ‘he who opens up ways, paths’ and may refer to a suc- cessful military campaign. His standard accompanied the king as a sort of battle ensign. His attributes as a god of war are the club and the bow. In processions he precedes the god → Osiris, just as he pre- cedes the king. In Abydos he became, as ‘lord of the necropolis’, a god of the dead. Upulevo The sun-god in the Indonesian island of Timor.

In the Vedas she is described as a delicate bride in rose-red garments with a golden veil. She drives in a car pulled by reddish cows (an image of the morning clouds). Usin y A Latvian deity with somewhat indeterminate functions. In part it has the characteristics of a god of light, with special reference to the morning or the evening star; in part, again, it is connected with spring, and, finally, appears as a sort of tutelary deity of bees. With the coming of Christianity, the figure of Usin m was transmutted into that of St George.

In other respects he falls short of the Akkadian sun-god → M ama m in importance and sig- nificance, and this is evident from the fact that he is classified under the moon-god ( → Nanna) who was his father. Uzume Japanese goddess of jollity, whose obscene dancing entices the god- dess → Amaterasu from her cave, thus ensuring the return of the spring sunshine bringing life and fertility. al-Uzza The Bedouin tribes in ancient central Arabia regarded al-Uzza as the youngest daughter of Allah (the other two being → Allat and → Manat).

It may appear either as an animal or in human form and it tries to lead travellers astray at cross-roads. Vahagn Armenian god of bravery and victory, corresponding to the Iranian → Verethragna. His epithet, Vi m apakal, has not been satisfactorily explained: it may mean ‘dragon-strangler’ (dragon-slayer) or ‘drawer up of dragons’, in the sense of a god of thunder-storms. In Armenian myth, Vahagn arises from fire and has flames for hair. Vahguru (‘Great guru’) The name of the one true God in the Sikh religion which has been influenced by both Hinduism and Islam. He is also known by the Hindu names Hari (‘God’) and Govinda (‘herds- man’). There are no images of gods in the Golden Temple at Amritsar. Vaim a nika In Jainism, a group of gods who dwell in mobile palaces in the world above. One of the most important gods in this group is → F akra. Väinämöinen The central figure in the Kalevala, the Finnish folk-epic: a singer of magical potency and inventor of the kantele (a zither-like instrument). He has all the marks of a shaman who can range through the underworld in the form of a snake; in the end, however, he is translated to the heavens where Orion is his scythe and the Pleiades form his woven shoes. In a list of gods drawn up in the sixteenth century he figures as Äinemöinen, ‘he who forges poems’. Vairocana (‘sun-scion’) One of the five → Dhy a ni-Buddhas. Of the five world-divisions, the centre is the one allotted to him, and his season is the win- ter. He is white in colour, and his hands are held in the so-called sermon position against his chest. His vehicle is a pair of dragons or a lion, and his emblem is a white wheel. In Tantrism he appears as three-faced and six-armed. In China, Vairocana is known as Pi-lu Fo and may appear in the office of a world-ruler. Certain Japanese sects like the Tendai and the Shingon regard him as the uni- versal Buddha, all other Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and gods being merely specific manifestations of him.

Finally he was seen as preceptor of esoteric doctrines and ‘lord of secrets’. Vajrasattva (‘Vajra-being’) Revered in Nepal as the sixth → Dhy a ni-Buddha. In much Tantric ritual he is regarded as a mystic Buddha. The second half of the night is allotted to him, and his season is autumn. He is portrayed balancing a vajra on his right hand in front of his breast. Vajrav a r a hi In Buddhist belief, one of the most important supernatural female beings ( → Da kin i ). Her name means ‘diamond-sow’ and this she owes to the fact that there is a growth close to her right ear which looks like a pig’s head. Her naked body is red like a pomegranate blossom. In her right hand she holds a thunderbolt ( vajra ), and in the left a skull and a club. Vajrayogin i A Buddhist goddess of initiation, one of the → Da kin i s. In her yellow form she is headless, and carries her head in her hand. From her rump comes a stream of blood. In her more usual red form, she has thunderbolt, cra- nium and club as attributes, and is functionally equivalent to → Vajrav a r a hi. Vali A Germanic god, the son of → Odin and of → Rind. He was only one night old when he avenged the death of → Balder by slaying the murderer Hödur. The speci- fication of ‘one night old’ probably refers to moment of initiation, not to date of birth. Valkyries (German Walküren; also as Valkyrien; Old Norse valkyrja \u0001 ‘she who selects the dead’) Supernatural female beings commissioned by the god → Odin to intervene in battles and bring heroes doomed to die (Einherjer) up to Valhalla, ‘hall of the dead’. From the names of individual Valkyries, their orig- inal function as natural demonic forces is clear: thus, for example, Wolkenthrut (‘cloud-power’) and Mist (‘fog’). It is not until the heroic epic in Middle High German that the anthropomorphic image of the warrior maiden appears. Vampire In south Slavonic folklore, the spirit of a dead person, or a corpse revived by an evil spirit. Vampires arise by night from graves and suck people’s blood. In the literature of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries – for example, in E.T.A. Hoffmann and Gogol – vampires became more and more demonic in char- acter: it is enough to think of the film fig- ure of Dracula. In Greek folklore the → Lamia correspond to the vampires. Vanir A group of north Germanic gods, including among their number → Freyr, → Freya, and → Njörd: all three of them being fertility deities. The struggle between the Aesir ( → As) and the Vanir, and the subsequent reconciliation between them, may reflect the opposition between two ways of life – that of the peasant and that of the warrior. The Vanir countenanced marriage between siblings, and they were master magicians ( seidr ). Vanth A female demon in the Etruscan underworld. She is represented as winged, with a snake, a torch and a key as attrib- utes. On alabaster urns from Volterra we can see that there is a large eye on the inside of each of her wings – a warning that this demonic being is everywhere present and keeps an eye on everybody. Vanth is a messenger of death and may be helpful with the quietus.

V a yu (Sanskrit \u0001 wind) Indian god of wind; it is related in certain myths that he arose from the breath of the world-giant → Puru s a. V a yu, → Agni and → S u rya form one of the oldest triads. In the Rigveda, the → Maruts appear as his sons. In Iran too there was a wind-god called Vayu along with → Vata. The Iranian Vayu was the tutelary god of warriors, and also a deity controlling fate. In this latter capacity he can appear as either a beneficient Vayu or an evil one (then also known as Wai). This dual role is particularly marked in the Pahlavi texts. Pantheistic speculation made Vayu out to be the breath of God, or the suspiration of the cosmos.

He is of youthful appearance and is reminiscent of → Aplu, 196 Var a ha The third incarnation of the Indian god → Vi sj u. In the form of a boar he slays the demon Hirañyak s a and frees the earth which the demon had sunk in the ocean. Varu v a The supreme god in Vedism, creator of the three worlds, heaven, earth and air. The etymology of the name is doubtful; it may be cognate with the Greek Uranos (‘sky’). Varu j a is the guardian of order, both cosmic and moral ( rita ). He binds evil-doers with his nooses; but he can undo sin just as one undoes a noose. In late Vedic theology, Va r u j a becomes lord of the night as → Mitra is of the day. In later mythology, Va r u j a is the god of water and guardian of the westerly quarter of heaven. One of his epithets is N a g a r a ja, ‘King of the snakes’. Vasi st ha In Indian mythology, a poet ( → Ri s i) who had access to the gods, and who may indeed have been himself of divine origin.

Her epithet is indicative: Kapu m a te , ‘graveyard-mother’. Venus (Latin \u0001 love, sensual desire) Old Italic goddess of spring and gardens, native to Latium. It was not until the beginning of the third century BC that her cult reached Rome. Her feast – the Veneralia – was celebrated on 1 April. Under the influ- ence of Greek literature she was equated with → Aphrodíte. Caesar, who regarded himself as descended from → Aenéas and hence from Aphrodíte/Venus, intro- duced the cult of Venus Genetrix, in which the life-giving function of the goddess was stressed. Verbti ( verbi \u0001 the blind one) Old Albanian god of fire and of the north wind which fans fires. He hates unclean- liness and bad ways of speaking. Christianization turned Verbti into a demon, and it was spread about that anyone who invoked him would go blind. Verdandi → Norns Verethragna Old Iranian god of victory who manifests himself in the wind, and then again in anthropomorphic or theriomorphic form. Particularly note- worthy is his incarnation as a boar which tramples opponents with its metal feet. The name contains the word vritra \u0001 encloser, obstruction (for the Indian form → Vritra): Verethragna is he who breaks down resistance, the victor. Vertúmnus (or Vortumnus) In origin, an Etruscan god ( → Voltumna) who was taken over by the Romans in the third century BC. He was revered as the god of change, i.e. of the changing year (Latin vertere \u0001 to turn, change). His feast, the Vortumnalia, was celebrated on 13 August. The wife of Vertúmnus was → Pomona.

Vidy a dhara (‘possessor of knowledge’) Semi-divine beings in Buddhist belief, who are supposed to possess a knowledge of supernatural powers. They can fly through the air and are therefore known as v a yuputras , ‘sons of the wind’. They bear garlands of flowers and are reminiscent of flying genii. In Tibet they are Tantric divinities under the name of rig-’dzin lnga , i.e. they are five ( lnga ) in number. Vidyujjv a l a kar a li A Buddhist god- dess, a specific form of → Ekaja ta .

Country people used to lay food and flow- ers in front of caves where they believed the vila dwelt.

The benign yak s as were taken over by Buddhism and appear in art, for example, as supporting figures. Yama of hell; he is clothed in red garments and he has a noose with which he draws the soul out of the body. He rides on a black buffalo.

Zalmoxis The supreme god of the Thracian Getae and Dacians (Dacia being the area known today as Romania). The only solid information we have about him comes from Herodotus. The ancient Greeks interpreted Zalmoxis as the founder of a religion, while present-day scholars tend to see him rather as an earth-god, a sky-god, a ruler of the dead or as a figure in divine mysteries. The legend tells how Zalmoxis took human form and lived among his people and then vanished for three years and was mourned as dead. In the fourth year, however, he came forth again from an underworld cave (the realm of the dead).

His name comes from the Indo-Germanic root dei (‘to shine’) and is cognate with the names of other sky-gods ( → Dyaus, Diu-pater → Jupiter). The myth of the divine child – reared by the goat → Amáltheia or by the bee Melissa, and hidden from Kronos by the armed dancers, the → Kurétes – goes back to Cretan/Mycenaean times. The grown Zeus hurls his father and the other Titans into Tartaros, and shares world-mastery thereafter with his brothers → Poseidon and → Hades. With his wife → Hera he sits enthroned in Olympus. He has many liaisons with mortal females, and on these occasions he appears in various guises – as a golden rain (with Danae), as a bull (with Europa), as a swan (with Leda).
