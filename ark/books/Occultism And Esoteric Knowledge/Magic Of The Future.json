It is rather a manual for the person who intends to put the tarot cards to use for spells. It is a how-to book, in which you can find exact instruction on how to set up the tarot cards to get the desired effect. Most people know the tarot only as a tool for divination. Each of the tarot cards represents a field of experience and/ or a function in life. In a tarot reading, you shuffle the cards and then you lay them out in a specific manner such as the Celtic Cross Method or the Tree of Life Method. Then you judge each card by its position in the layout and how it relates to the other cards. From this you can then derive important statements about the person for whom you are reading. Here we are talking about spells. When you give a tarot reading, you channel energies from the universe toward yourself. You use the cards as indicators of what the universe tells you. If you do a spell with the tarot, you use the cards as energy filters. In the case of a spell, the tarot cards represent the energies that you are about to send off. I have mentioned above that each tarot card represents a field of experience, or a function, or an idea. As such, each tarot card is an archetypal symbol. To combine tarot cards means to combine ideas. Consequently the tarot cards are an ideal tool to creatively act upon your universe in magical operations. A magical operation is any action at a distance that involves the use of structural links and life energy, or psychic power. Therefore, to be effective in magical work, you need a source of life energy, a psychic link to the target of your operation (unless the target of your magical operation is present), and a structural link that represents the specific action that you desire. The success of every magical work depends on these three key factors. The better the psychic link to your target is, the easier you can influence it with a magical operation, or spell. Psychic links for targeting are structural links that are near- identical with the target. Hair and fingernails contain the genetic code that is unique for every individual. This genetic code allows you to connect with every cell in the body of the target person. Clothing has a similar effect. This is so because clothing has skin rubbings in it even after it went through the washer and drier. Other good psychic links with the target are visualization, the writing down of the name (which involves visualization), and radionic settings. These psychic links are not of the identical kind, but of an “equivalent nature.” Equivalent structural links are an excellent substitute in cases where near identical links are not available. A radionics setting is such an equivalent structural link, and so is any design symbolizing the target person of your operation. Photos are somewhat in between the two extremes that we have just described.

At a very early age, he has developed a fascination for science in general and for the stars in particular. Consequently, he has read eagerly any book on astronomy, astrophysics, mathematics and physics that he could get hold of. At age 16, he became interested in the subject of hypnosis. He began studying this discipline, later he perfected Autogenic Training and eventually, at age 18, he began the practice of Hatha Yoga. This practice strengthened his then frail body within a few weeks and his overall condition and health improved considerably. Quite naturally, these spectacular results gave Karl an incentive to explore other sciences that were not part of his academic curriculum. Studies and practice in astrology, practical magic, rune magic, and practice of various forms of life energy technology such as astral traveling and clairvoyance followed within one year. He studied the works of Mesmer, Korschelt, von Reichenbach, Tesla, Lahkowski, and others. At age 19, Karl began his graduate studies in mathematics and physics. Several times, he interrupted his academic studies to travel extensively. In the course of these travels, he gained valuable information about magical practices and the use of life force in many cultures and traditions and he met many gifted teachers and adepts on the subject matter. During his stays in South Africa, Switzerland, Berlin, and, since 1974, the United States of America, he continued his studies, which he then rounded off with general semantics, radionics, Reichian psychology, and orgone physics. Shortly after his arrival in the United States, he built his first orgone accumulators and conducted multiple experiments with these amazing devices. It was obvious that what Reich called orgone was the same form of energy that he had explored for more than a decade before knowing of Reich. In fact, a device he built years earlier following the plans of Korschelt was an orgone accumulator. Korschelt called his device a “Solar Ether Radiation Apparatus” — its plans are dating back to 1897. Mesmer’s barrels with iron filings, also built and tested by Welz years before he studied Reich, were obviously the earliest orgone accumulators of which we know that were built by a scientist with the accumulation of life force in mind. Therefore, we can safely say that Franz Anton Mesmer has invented the life force accumulator one and a half centuries before Reich. Soon he realized that orgone can be projected at any distance and that this projection follows structural links. This is a fact that was evident to people of all ages and cultures who harnessed life force, such as shamans, conjurers, spiritual workers, magicians, and healers. For this type transfer he had to develop a factors, you can read the course “Magic of the Future” by Karl Hans Welz. For a strong effect of the spell, you need a strong source of life energy. Many magicians create their own energy as they need it. The creating of psychic energy, or life energy, is an integral part of every magical ritual. Magicians use a variety of methods to create life energy. These methods range from chanting, dancing, sex magical practices, and processes of visualization all the way to the sacrificing of animals. A most effective way to generate life energy continuously is the Welz Chi Generator. The third, equally important, factor is the “energy filter.” This energy filter is a structural representation of a desired action or of a specific energy (entity) that works toward a desired result. This structural link to the action, or energy filter, needs to be a correct representation of the intention of the magician. Otherwise the spell may not be effective or it may have an unexpected outcome. We are back at the tarot cards full circle. The tarot cards are a system of such energy filters that can be applied to practically all situations. For all these reasons, to be a good magician means years of training, practice, and study. Or does it? Study the course “Magic of the Future” and you will realize that you can learn magic with ease and fast. The skill is the correct success strategy for each one of your operations, bypassing potential interferences, etc. Many of the spell books on the market make the task of casting effective spells seem easy, and all too often would- be magicians get only meager results. This is so, because they are not capable of creating the psychic connection (structural link) with the target or they cannot generate a sufficiently large"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 5 mathematical model that accounts for this phenomenon. This model also accounts for many of the amazing phenomena of ESP, magic, radionics, even astrology. In 1992, he invented the orgone generator ® . This extraordinary new device is a significant step beyond the mere accumulating of orgone energy as happens inside the orgone accumulator. Furthermore he realized soon that pulsed orgone energy (which an orgone generator can produce — or a rotating planet) transforms DOR (deadly orgone) back into orgone energy. The problem of “orgone accumulators going bad” when afflicted by DOR was successfully counteracted with a technological device for the first time in known history. More striking proof of this characteristic of orgone generators ® became evident when he invented a DOR generator. The orgone generators TM proved to be effective in counteracting the negative effects of devices that develop DOR when operating, such as radioactive smoke detectors, fluorescent tubes, TV screens, and other electromagnetic pollution. The orgone accumulating devices on the other hand, are ineffective. In fact, these devices “foul up”, i.e., when exposed to deadly orgone (DOR) too long, they accumulate it and consequently become centers of this energy. Soon Karl Welz recognized that the orgone generator ® can be a significant help in many practices involving the use of life energy (or orgone) such as the development and practice of ESP, magic, self improvement, and trend generation with the help of astrological energies. Extensive testing confirmed that orgone that is pulsed in low frequencies (Alpha, Theta, Delta states, etc.) is considerably more effective to cause the corresponding brain wave states than any one of the now obsolete methods that use sound, light, or electric pulses. The orgone generator ® has been on the market since early 1993. Tens of thousands of people all over the world who decided to have an edge in their aspirations are now the proud owners of these devices. In 1994, Mr. Welz invented a new orgone accumulating material (orgonite ® ) that is significantly more effective than the traditional materials such as layers of steel wool and fiberglass or celotex. This new material allows making powerful orgone generators ® of very small size! amount of psychic energy (life force) for the spell. With the invention of the WELZ CHI GENERATOR, this situation has changed dramatically. Now even a beginner can cast effective spells. The Welz Chi Generator creates sufficient psychic energy, or life force, to lock on to the target, and to actively effect the outcome of every spell AT THE TURN OF A DIAL! To do magical work successfully, you need to have the following: A good structural link to the target of your work, a good power source for life energy, and an appropriate filter that correctly represents the energy that you send to the target of your work. It is up to you by now to find a good structural link. It may be hair, a photo, or a transfer design that the person whom you help carries with him/ her or you can use a radionics device. To generate sufficient life energy and to generate it continuously for your spell work, you should have a Welz Chi Generator. People who do many spells usually have several of the smaller generators or they work with the powerful RAD 2400 HD. As far as the energy filter is concerned, the tarot spells in this book provide you with a wide range of applications. If you follow the instructions in this book carefully, there is very little that can go wrong when you do magical work with the tarot cards. For very specific situations HSCTI has set up a spell consulting service that you can access by telephone (www.spelllab.com). Using the instructions given here, you can set up an effective tarot spell with a Welz Chi Generator (such as the JU 99 CE, or LPOG 2400 DL) and a deck of tarot cards. To hone your skills further, I strongly recommend that you purchase a good introduction in the tarot. I recommend highly Eden Gray’s MASTERING THE TAROT or any other of Eden Gray’s books. The best deck for the spell work is the RIDER WAITE TAROT DECK. With very few exceptions, most other tarot decks are outcroppings of artistic fantasies rather than symbolically correct representations of universal archetypes. Experience taught us that symbolically correct representations make magical work much easier. My good education prevents me from giving my opinion about the books on tarot spells that are presently on the market."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com T HE T AROT C ARDS The Tarot deck has 78 cards. Each card has a specific meaning. The Tarot deck has 22 major Arcana and 4 suits of minor Arcana. The major Arcana represent universal energies, or universal ideas. The four sets of minor Arcana represent energies that are more specific. These energies relate to the four elements of fire, water, air, and earth. The books by Eden Gray are very good introductions into the understanding of the tarot cards. For the more advanced person I suggest the book “The Tarot of the Bohemians” by Papus. The purpose of this book is to give you a series of Tarot Spells that you can adjust to many situations of magical work. In the following, you find the abbreviations that we are going to use in the descriptions of all spells in this book. 1. The Major Arcana: For the major Arcana, we are using Roman Numerals: I The Magician II The High Priestess III The Empress IV The Emperor V The Hierophant VI The Lovers VII The Chariot VIII Strength IX The Hermit X The Wheel of Fortune XI Justice XII The Hanged Man XIII Death XIV Temperance XV The Devil XVI The Tower XVII The Star XVIII The Moon XIX The Sun XX Judgment XXI The World 0 The Fool 2. The Minor Arcana Each card of the minor Arcana appears in the following manner: K for King, QU for Queen, KN for Knight, and PG for Page. The cards from 1 through 10 carry their respective number: 1 is for the Ace, two for the two, etc. The suits are as follows: wd for wands, cp for cups, sw for swords, and pt for pentacles. Examples: 2 cp = Two of Cups. Kn sw = Knight of Swords 1 pt = Ace of Pentacles 10 wd = Ten of Wands. 3. Stacks of Cards in the Tarot Layout Description: Some set up of spells require stacks of two or more cards. When we describe a spell, these stacks of cards appear in the following manner: 1 cp / VIII / 9 cp means that the Nine of Pentacles is at the bottom, above it is Strength, and on top of the stack is the Ace of Cups! H OW TO S ET UP A T AROT S PELL For a spell you can set up the Tarot cards in two ways. The first method is to lay out the card after card, starting from the front end of the Welz Chi Generator or, if you still do not have one, from where you are standing (if on the floor) or sitting (if the layout is on the table). Usually, you put the link to the target with the last card of the layout."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The New Welz Chi Generator® Is more than a generator of life force It is a way of life !!!

Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 7 Some of the positions may be stacks of two, three, or four cards, rather than single cards. The second method consists of stacking the cards, and putting the stack standing between the output of the Welz Chi Generator and the structural link to the target. If cards branch to the side such as in some of the love spells, you slide the side cards a bit into the stack so that their position is evident. A RRANGEMENT #1 The following is a spell for success in business. It will serve as an example of how to set up the cards in front of the Welz Chi Generator. First you set up the Welz Chi Generator. About two inches in front of the output pipe of the generator, you put the first card, which in our case is the card #8 of the major Arcana: STRENGTH (VIII). Put the card down face up, with the bottom of the card closest to the output of the EPG and the top of the card on the far end. This is the upright position of a card. When a card is reversed, you put it down with the top end closer to the output pipe. Next to STRENGTH (VIII), at its top end, is THE HIGH PRIESTESS (II). The next card is THE MAGICIAN (I), then The HANGED MAN (# XII), then The HIEROPHANT (# V), followed by The WHEEL OF FORTUNE (card # X of the major arcana), which is followed by a STACK of 4 cards and the psychic link to the person for whom the spell is performed: Bottom card: the THREE OF WANDS, on top of it the NINE OF CUPS, which is covered by the TEN OF PENTACLES, on top of it the SIGNIFICATOR OF THE"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com PERSON for whom you perform the spell, and on top of it the PSYCHIC LINK to that person. The choice of the significator can be a problem for the person who is not familiar with the tarot. Use the following guidelines: Pages: Persons of both sexes up to 15 years of age. Knights: Persons of both sexes, unmarried, age 16 to 25. Queens: Women, married, or over 25 years of age. Kings: Men, married, or over 25 years of age. The four suits relate to basic characteristics of the person: Cups: Spiritual persons, scholars, artists, or priests. Pentacles: Materialistic persons or business persons. Wands: Farmers, laborers, earthy persons. Swords: aggressive persons, military, police, justice 2. Settings Chi Generators of the “Junior” series have fixed frequencies. Set other generators at a flickering rate, at the threshold of where you perceive the flickering as a continuous light. In other words: the flickering should be so fast that you barely can perceive it as such. You can use a pendulum or a stick pad to determine the optimal rate of flickering (frequency) for the situation. In fact, any frequency that you choose will work. Set a very slow blinking speed if you know that the target person is asleep during the time when you perform the spell. OTHER REMARKS: The only thing that is crucial is the set up of the tarot cards. The frequency of the Welz Chi Generator is of secondary importance. This holds for all tarot spells. Experience will teach you what settings and what timing is best for every purpose. A good rule is to set a slow frequency when the target person is likely to be asleep and a higher frequency when the person is in a waking state. Keep the machine running for a day or two, then stop for a day, then start up again. Alternatively you can have the machine only running while the target person is asleep or you can keep it running while the target person is in a waking state. If you do the above business spell for yourself it is good to have a transfer diagram on the spell instead of the significator for yourself. You carry the identical diagram with you. Better yet is the transfer couple that you get with your Chi Generator, of which one part is with the last card of the spell arrangement, while you carry the other part on yourself. I strongly suggest that you keep the machine running while you are doing business. This is even more important, if you set up a spell that gives you an edge in negotiations.

Now, hold the center of the palm of either hand approximately one inch (2 – 3 cm) above the printout of the diagram. Be sure that your hand is relaxed: open, and not stretched out!

All cards and the psychic link or transfer diagram are in one stack. You lean this stack onto a vertical surface such as a box or a picture frame. The card that is closest to the Welz Chi Generator in arrangement #1 (in our example it’s STRENGTH) will face the output pipe of the generator in arrangement #2. The psychic link is the one closest to the picture frame. If you are a beginner in performing Tarot spells, it is an advantage to use arrangement #1 on every spell before you proceed to arrangement #2. This is so because arrangement #1 gives you better insights into the working of the spell. Important: The timing given with the individual spells that follow are for middle of the line devices such as the LPOG 2400 DL or RAD 2000. Run the devices of the “Junior” series three to four times as long, and the HD devices (RAD 2400 HD and LPOG 2400 HD) about one third the times given here.

Moreover, it does so without loss of energy . All that is needed is the right structural link (some professionals prefer to call it “psychic link”) to establish contact. This fact makes their work possible, even easy! In fact, it is so easy that everybody is now capable of working the magic of professional psychics, shamans, spiritual workers, etc. This has been one of the reasons why many of these professionals decided to guard their powerful secrets like precious gems, making them available only to very few hand picked people.

Besides of the use of these words being blatant violations of trademark laws, much of the equipment that is offered has little to do with the generation of orgone energy, and the “orgonite formulas” are poor, since I was very careful in not revealing my formula, so there was nothing to steal besides the most rudimentary and obvious ingeredients. Naturally, the JU 99 CE, which is in the price range of the cheapest copy cat devices, has silver tubing, Voltage Regulator and other features that put it light years ahead of those poor imitations.

T HE C OURSE IN M AKING T ALISMANS L ESSON I I NTRODUCTION As far as we look back in written history we find reports of magic. If we go beyond written history and analyze archaeological objects, we can find many that we can explain as being magical. We find also magical practices with people that are still living in the Stone Age. From this we can safely conclude that magic is as old as mankind. Immediately the question arises whether magic is traditional in principle or whether someone some time back actually invented the principles of this science. It is my opinion that magical interaction with the environment is a result of empirical insights. Early humans had experiences such as precognition of extra sensory perception. For instance, the have been very angry at another person and this person suffered some harm soon afterwards. From such consistent experiences it is only a small step toward actively repeating the experience. The creativity of early humans has not been blocked by rigid scientific dogmas telling them of how the world around is supposed to look and function. The space time concepts of these beings followed the experience they had. This experience naturally included magical practice and the results of this practice. Therefore the concepts of space that these humans had were essentially different from our average concepts. With such flexible concepts they were better equipped to perform magical action than most humans of our days. Our times experience a surge in magical practice. The problem that many practitioners face in our days is their own rigidified concepts of the environment in which they live. This environment has lost its magic in the true meaning of the word! People who have been conditioned at an early age to accept rigidified pop scientific concepts on the one hand and religious indoctrination on the other find it very difficult to accept magical action as something totally natural. In fact, this action is just as natural at reaching out with the hand to grasp something. Such conditioning toward pop science and academic science helps those folks who have a vested interest of keeping the status quo: people of established religion on the one hand and power hungry temple masters of a magical religion on the other. Worse yet, this rigidity plays well into the hands of those whose only interest lies in totally debunking anything that’s magical."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"You Can Get what You Want and by now you can have this extra magickal power which spells success Before you begin to use the Orgone Generator ® to help you achieve decisive positive permanent solutions, you can now examine thoroughly your innermost desires and ask yourself a few key questions: 1. Do other people envy you? Or do you envy others? 2. Do other people want to be like you? Or do you wish you were living other peoples’ lives? 3. Are others in awe of you? Do they puzzle at your meteoric rise to the top as much as they wonder about your success, accomplishments and amazingly good fortune? Or is it perhaps the other way around? Here is a list of some of the good things that you probably want: The things you want to own The money you want to acquire The things you like to achieve The exotic places you want to see The abilities you like to have Good fortune at all times The love you like to receive Abundance on all levels Achieve and maintain balance, harmony and peace And much, much more... Now, in this course you are learning that it is your Power that carries your decision, obeys your command . This Power is a manifestation of the life force that you have available . Wise people in the Far East called this life force, or power, Chi and they developed many techniques of self-improvement from this knowledge such as Tai Chi and Chi Gong. Modern Western terms for life force are orgone, animal magnetism, Od, Solar ether, and others. To understand the advantage that this Power, i.e., life force, can give you, imagine the following: Bring a native in from a remote jungle to a city. The electricity will not work for him until he realizes that this button turns on that light and that switch turns on this radio. Naturally, for him the effects of electricity are “magic”. His friends who never learned how to flip a switch have no access to this magic whatsoever. 18 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com What I pointed out above should make it clear once and for all: there is nothing supernatural to magic. Intelligent analysis of magical practice leads to a very few basic scientific principles that you can use to explain the whole field with ease. I have demonstrated this beyond the shadow of any doubt in my course “Magic of the Future.” I could well have chosen another title for that course: magic of the past in the light of science. Talismans are as ancient as mankind. Early humans intuitively knew that they could combine symbols, plants, animal parts, etc., for specific purposes such as love, wealth, health, success, or protection. When organized religion began to take over, talismans gained the aspect of the Divine hierarchies that these religions preached. When such a talisman worked as expected, followers of these religions saw this as a proof that their religion was the only true one. Quite often they were oblivious of the fact that other religious systems also offered talismans that worked. When there was no longer any denying was possible as to effectiveness of talismans from other tradition these objects were considered to be evil. What is a Talisman? By now it is obvious that a talisman is an object that serves a specific purpose. The purpose is the influencing of events. If a man is in danger of attack, he may want a talisman for protection. If someone wants to find a partner, a talisman for love can be of great help. Talismans are batteries of psychic energy. They are structured with energies of a higher order that can bring the desired trends into action. The way the talisman is made determines its action. Its structure represents the forces, or spirits, that are called for help in the circumstances for which the talisman is made."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"As you know by now, Your Power is dependent on your available Life Force.

These modestly priced units can provide you with great solutions for years. All of them you can integrate into increasingly sophisticated workstations. Middle of the line units provide a wider variety, more power, and upgraded features.

Basic and middle of the line units and kits are a great choice for persons who use this extraordinary equipment in the main for self-improvement and for management of their desires. For added impact upon others or to exercise some form of mind management (or mind control) upon them, and for work with superior effectiveness, you should choose a unit that’s top of the line.

The amulet is for protection only. People carry amulets to ward off undesirable powers, spirits, or human beings. The talisman has a more active role. It is a magnet that attracts the desired new circumstances. Quite often, a talisman combines active and protective purposes. Astrological talismans that represent the planets are a good example for that. These talismans are activators and protectors at the same time. A talisman is a battery of cosmic energies. If you wear a talisman, you can tap into these energies whenever you need to do so. The talisman acts automatically in the appropriate situations, whether you are aware of its action or not. When you first make a talisman, you give it an initial charge. After this initial charge, the talisman self charges continuously and it stores the charge until you need it. The talisman acts as a transformer of life energy that you find everywhere in the universe. It continuously attracts life energy from its surroundings (ideally from a generator of life force) and it dynamizes it with its specific symbolic structure. This way the life energy that it emanates carries with it the power of the desired trend, or action. In this course, you will gain a good understanding of the working of a talisman and some instructions of how to make for yourself a good selection of powerful talismans. You can use these talismans then whenever you see a need for this. Types of Talismans The purposes of talismans are infinite. The only limits are self imposed boundaries of human imagination and human desire. No matter how far you wishing and desiring reaches, you will always find more wishes, goals and desires beyond. Amulets have protective purposes only. Some of them serve the purpose to ward off demonic or other negative forces. Others help as a protection of the home. Some of the amulets have the special purpose of warding off the “evil eye.” Most talismans have the purpose to draw good circumstances such as luck, love, health, power, success, and wealth. In this category fall also the talismans that help reach goals of a more spiritual nature such as philosophical insights, wisdom, knowledge, and psychic powers. History tells us many examples in which would-be lovers went on to harness the powers of talismans after all other means failed. My own professional practice is filled with stories of success in similar situations. Quite often a simple talisman could lead to the success that had eluded the client for a long time. One of the most famous talismans of which history tells us is the love talisman that Catherina de Medici, Queen of France, has commissioned and worn. It contains the symbolism that shows it to be a very powerful magnet to attract love for its wearer. There have been sick persons, especially those who were considered to be terminally ill, who resorted to the use of talismans after all skills of conventional medical practice failed. For centuries the planetary squares have been used as a stock in trade by the medical profession. The physician determined first the planet"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com that ruled the disease, then he prescribed the magical square of the opposing planet to bring about a balance of energies in the patient. It is quite interesting to note that these planetary talismans were acceptable to the then omnipotent church while all other magical practices were punishable by death. In old times childbirth was a risk for both, mother and child. Magicians and priests alike designed talismans to protect against the demonic influences that were thought to be out to kill mother and child. Talismans for success, to ease bad circumstances, and for love that are made by followers of a religious system that sees suffering or guilt as its highest goal cannot have the powerful impact as do talismans that are made by people who do not expose themselves to such horrible limitations. If you want a talisman that works, do not ask a person who believes in suffering to make it for you. Business and politics are another field where talismans find wide use. Many people pursue success, power, and wealth. There are many persons who made it to the top and credit this to one or more skillfully designed talismans. Talismans that are incorporated in houses are here to bring success, health and protection to its inhabitants. The very structure of some houses follows talismanic principles. A good example are Runic symbols that you find in the beam structure of Saxon-style houses. Another important group of talismans are astrological talismans. These talismans take elements of the zodiac to counteract shortcomings in an individual horoscope. The proper making of an astrological talisman requires a thorough knowledge not only in talismanology, but also in astrology. Some astrological talismans can be very precise. They are fine tuned to the exact positions of the planets in an individual horoscope. Therefore such talismans are useless for any person other than the one for whom they were made initially. General purpose astrological talismans, on the other hand, can help any person. Planetary talismans are such general purpose talismans. M ATERIALS USED FOR T ALISMANS When I first began to make talismans, I had an interesting experience. I was designing a talisman for a specific purpose. My teacher came by and I asked him what material I should best use for this talisman. His short answer was: Take toilet paper! This answer was a total surprise for me at first. I thought that he was kidding me. Then I realized that the material is of importance, but that it is not all important. What counts is the energy that you put into the talisman. Like anywhere else in magic, there are no absolutes in talismanic practice and no strict dogmas. The material is of help indeed. It is an added factor that establishes a structural link to the energies that the talisman is expected to project. Many different materials were used to make talismans throughout the ages. It depended much on what materials were available to the person who made the talisman. Especially in illiterate societies the material chosen takes a special importance. It becomes symbol for the deity, or energy, that the talisman is to project. To combine the materials means to combine the special creative energies that the materials represent. We know of correlations between specific trees and deities. When a person wishes to have the power of this deity, the talisman will"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"You learned it in this course: The fact that Magic and Radionics are perfectly interchangeable! A radionics device establishes non-fleeting and stable structural links. In this respect, the radionics device has a decisive advantage over the human brain, which has the characteristic of “moving around”. Magical objects and magical sigils are structural links of the same stability. Therefore, a radionics device can also be called a “universal magical sigil”. It is a technological device that establishes structural links and holds these structures longer than our brain can do. The advantage of the radionics device over the magical or any other symbol is its infinite flexibility! The seasoned magician always prefers a combination of the two: the magical sigil to make use of energies that people have used successfully over and over again and the radionics device for the purpose of fine-tuning these energies and adjusting them to the specific purpose of the operation. This way they can tie into well-established energy patterns (the magical symbol), which they modify for a specific purpose with the radionics device. The Power Radionics TM Program combines the two in a most effective way! The most important factor required for the success of a radionics operation is not the specific make-up of the device that you use to establish equivalent structural links; it is the amount of life force used for the operation and the sophistication and adaptability of the envisioned trend energies, ideally as an “independently acting” thought form. This is the reason why the RAD 2400 HD is ideal for your magical work. It is obvious by now that the radionics device is the ideal tool to establish equivalent structural links that connect to any desired target, trend, or to both. The advantage of the radionics device over the methods of traditional magic, such as sigils, oils, dolls, etc., is the obvious fact of its incredible flexibility. Sigils, oils, etc., are designed for one thing and one thing only. The radionics device naturally can be set up for any purpose. IT IS UNIVERSAL !!! Magic is action that uses life force and structural links. Seen under this aspect, radionics is magic that uses technological devices (including computer programs) as universal structural links, which you can tune to any desired trend and/or target. Our Equipment, computer programs and other accessories have their scientific basis in this principle. Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 23 be of the wood that is “sacred” to that deity. In our times the preferred materials for talismans are still very varied. We know of mojo bags that contain specific herbal mixtures, wooden talismans, metal talismans, talismans that have precious and semi precious stones attached, and talismans of paper or parchment. Good jewelry should have a function as a talisman. Otherwise it’s worthless “artistic” junk, no matter how much you paid for it. The choice of form and stones should be left to a good talismanologist. Some talismans are not worn by a person, but they stay in that person’s dwelling or business. Examples are statues of saints or gods. People who practice some form of natural magic like to use plants, parts of plants and parts of animals such as feathers, teeth, and claws, for talismans. I NSCRIPTIONS AND S YMBOLS ON T ALISMANS We know of talismans that have no inscriptions at all. They are composed of parts, the combination of which relates structurally to the trends that the talisman is designed to bring. The talisman is then activated by charging it with the intent combined with a surge of life energy. Mojo bags are a good example for such talismans. The herbal mixtures in these bags form structural links with the energies of a higher order (trends, or deities) that the talisman connects with. You will find an elaborate theory of structural links, energies of a higher order and life energy surges in my course magic of the future . Symbols that represent deities or other energies of a higher order are a"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com powerful addition to a talisman and so are inscriptions that have the same purpose. There are a variety of symbolisms available that are representations of the multi-dimensional spectrum of energies of a higher order that surrounds us. When we combine such symbols on a talisman, we can determine exactly the purpose of the talisman that we are designing. To combine symbols of this kind literally means creatively acting upon the universe. In most traditions, deities have not only a symbol, but above all else they have a name. To inscribe the name of a deity besides its symbol establishes an additional structural link with it. In some traditions the magicians claim that ‘when you know the true name of something, then you have control over it. Some inscriptions are prayers or wishes that are written in an ancient language. Antiquity of the language adds to the power. This is so because people of many eons have called to the same forces over and over again. The linkage thus established becomes stronger with each use. An alternative is to entirely custom tailor the structural linkage to trends or spirits. The advantage of this is precision that the magician can achieve in expressing the purpose of the talisman. This process compares to creating a specific deity, or spirit. The more elements that are structural links to energies of a higher order, the more powerful the talisman will be. Therefore talismanologists take great care in choosing the right materials of the talisman, the right symbols and inscriptions, the right incenses for fumigation and the right oils for specific charge. It takes a lot of practical knowledge to be able to choose all the right ingredients. In this course I am going to include tables and lists that give you a basic knowledge that is necessary for the making of powerful talismans. If you know such basics, you will be able to make talismans for nearly all purposes. A good overall knowledge of magical astrology, cabalah, and many other metaphysical disciplines is an advantage for the talismanologist. An important factor in making talismans is the choice of the best time(s) to make the talisman. Such choice is usually based on astrological factors. In all, this seems a huge amount of knowledge that you need to acquire if you want to become proficient in the art of making good and powerful talismans that serve a precise purpose. On the other hand, it is not something that’s sheer impossible! In this course, you will learn to make good talismans for a general purpose. Such talismans do not require extensive background training. To make them is relatively easy. This you will find out in the second lesson where you begin with the practice of making talismans. You will make a talisman that will help you harmonize your relations to others. As you continue to study this course and further talismanic literature, you will gain more and more insights in this fascinating field until you will be a true expert in talismanic practice."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 25 L ESSON II Y OUR FIRST TALISMAN Practice is the best teacher! It will help you understand the principles that are involved with the making of talismans. This is the reason why you will go ahead to make your first talisman now, in this second lesson. The talisman that I have chosen for you to make has been around for at least 1900 years. It is the famous Sator Arepo talisman. Many people have appreciated it because of its manifold powers that its inscription connects with. The Sator Arepo Talisman, its effects, its history. In the book, The Egyptian Secrets of Albertus Magnus, you find another reference to this talisman. There the author claims that you can extinguish a fire when you throw into the flames a tin plate that has this square engraved. This recipe obviously has a hidden meaning rather than a literal one. You find such hidden meanings in many of the old magical books, or grimoires. The hidden meaning in this previous statement is the following: the talisman can calm down anger and rage (fire), especially when it is sent off with an attitude of benevolence and optimism. You find the reference to benevolence and optimism in the statement about the metal, tin. Tin is ruled by Jupiter, the planet that brings benevolence and optimism into our lives. Engrave the Sator Arepo talisman on a tin disk and it will help you control anger and rage, your own or of people with which you are dealing. It will calm down a hot temper. Traditionally this talisman had the reputation of bringing good luck and love. Modern magicians recognized it to give slight telepathic capabilities, mainly by virtue of its power to intensify thoughts and bringing thoughts closer to the material plane. This characteristic explains the old formula concerning this talisman: Hold the talisman in your right hand while wishing something intensely. The wish will be fulfilled! I like to give the talisman to my students, because it helps penetrate magical and mystical secrets with ease. The difficulties that may arise from too fast a progress in magical sciences will likely not occur to the student who carries this talisman. It allows you to get more and more in tune with the energies of the universe. Another characteristic of this talisman is important to mention. It protects the person who carries it against attack. This is so because the attacker The Sator Arepo talisman is a letter talisman. It has five rows of letters that are arranged in a regular way. This talisman is truly a ‘classic’ among the talismans of the Western tradition. Nobody can say exactly where it came from. Some assume that it is an early Christian magic formula. Others say that it originated in the Gnostic school of Marcion. The talisman has general purpose. People a few centuries ago claimed that it helps discover witches and protect against them, for no witch can stay in the same room where this talisman is."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com sees his or her own meanness in the carrier of the talisman who is object of the attack. Consequently the attacker gets scared and stops scheming. The arrangement of the letters in this talisman shows some karmic correlations. It is a talisman that helps the carrier to modify karma. Coming from a Gnostic school of the first century CE, the words are Latin, and so are the letters. I have run across many “explanations” of the virtues of this talisman that were based on Hebrew lettering and corresponding cabalistic principles. Usually these explanations tried to “prove” some point such as the exclusive validity of some metaphysical school. My good education prevents me from expressing in writing the thoughts that I have about such manipulations. The talisman is at the beginning of many metaphysical systems. Probably this is so because the talisman represents the as above so below in some manner. It can bring the carrier in tune with his or her cosmic mission and with cosmic responsibilities. One important characteristic of this talisman is that it can help get rid of any kind of haunting, spooking and the like. Some persons draw a diagram on the back side of the talisman. This diagram represents the structure of the lettering on the front side. It increases the sensitivity of the person wearing the talisman still more. I NSTRUCTIONS OF H OW TO M AKE Y OUR F IRST T ALISMAN I will keep the instructions that follow as simple as possible. As you continue with your practice, I am going to explain each of the steps that you are going to take. If you do follow these steps with care, you will end up with a fine talisman that will be a good help for you for the time to come. In addition to this, you will be able to use this talisman to make other talismans. This is so, because you can intensify the energies of other talismans with it. To make this talisman you proceed step by step as listed below. I recommend that you follow these steps with every talisman that you make. 1. Procuring the materials (incl. oils and incenses) or making sure the materials are available. 2. Setting up your workspace 3. Preparing the materials 4. Choosing the time 5. Preparing yourself 6. Making the physical object that will be the talisman 7. Charging the talisman (also fumigation and rubbing with oil) 1. Procure the materials (incl. oils and incenses) or making sure the materials are here. Before you start making a talisman, you need to be sure that you have all the materials that you need. Most of the time this means to go out and buy or otherwise procure these materials. In more involved situations, you need to follow some rules when you procure the materials. Some herbs, for instance, have more magical potency when they are harvested at specific times. If you prepare herbal tinctures using methods of alchemy, you may need to wait for specific astrological “windows” or you can generate these energies in other ways such as with a Chi Generator. If you are a practicing magician, chances are that you have most materials available. In this case all you need to do is getting the materials from your resources."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 27 The materials that you need to consider are: materials for the making of the talismans, materials of the talisman proper, and materials that you need for the ceremonial of making the talisman such as incense for fumigation and oils for special charging the talisman. For your Sator Arepo Talisman you need: a. Your altar, covered with a white tablecloth. You can use a table. b. Something that represents the three elements of fire, water, and air. The talisman will be the synthesis of the three, the earth element. Censor with frankincense White candle Cup with water A cord to make the outline of a triangle on the altar 3. A sheet of parchment. Parchment is difficult to find. You can use a sheet of paper, parchtone paper or parchment paper instead and clear foil to laminate the paper. 2. Set up your workspace You make the talisman in a ceremonial setting that is not unlike the setup of an altar. To make your Sator Arepo talisman it is good if you do this in a ceremonial setting from beginning to end. On your table, set up a triangle large enough to contain the utensils representing the elements. The tip of the equilateral triangle should point away from you. Its base should be close to you. There should be sufficient space between the base of the triangle and you to allow making your talisman with ease. Set the white candle in the corner of the triangle that is farthest away from you. Put the cup with water into the left corner of the triangle and the incense burner into the right corner. This altar set up has to do with the four magical elements of fire, water, air, and earth. You can learn more about the elements and the aligning of these elements in the Course in Cosmic Consciousness, which is available from HSCTI. In front of the triangle and outside of it put the utensils that you need for the making of the talisman: parchment, pen or quill, ink (if you use a quill), lamination sheets, stencils for the circle, a ruler, and scissors. 3. Light the candle and incense 4. Project power into the water Hold your hand above the water. Imagine energy leaving your hand and entering the water. You find more details about this practice in the course “Magick of the Future.” 5. Mentally cleanse the materials which you use to make the talisman, especially the parchment or paper. Imagine all energy leaving the material and draining into the ground. 6. Choice of the timing. The choice of the right time for the making of a talisman is of great importance. Therefore it is good for the talismanologist to learn the basic principles of magical astrology. Some talismanologists prefer to have an astrologer select the correct time for them. The chosen time is such that the cosmic constellations reflect the purpose of the talisman. A love talisman, for example, is very good when Venus is powerful and in good aspect with Mars. Approximate methods consist of setting up the desired planetary energies within the realm in which you make the talisman. If you use an approximation, you are not dependent on the time. You create a greenhouse of astrological"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com energies that you create, so to say, which has the right condition for the talisman. A good tool to set up such a field of astrological energies is a Welz Chi generator. Very good is the ATGS 3000. With this amazing machine you can actually generate fields of astrological energy that never occur naturally! That’s something that magicians of the old never thought about! It adds a new dimension to the art of making talismans! The Sator Arepo talisman is general purpose. Therefore you can make it at any time. 7. Prepare Yourself Now you can go ahead to the actual work of making the talisman. At the time that you determined to be good for this purpose, you bring yourself gradually into a mental state that will help you in your work. This you begin best by entering a state of meditation. Meditation removes you from the influences of everyday life. Very good for this purpose is a state of consciousness in which you have the elements aligned. You can find this information in the course of cosmic consciousness. You can find this course on the net at www.meditrance.com. The insights in the working of the universe that you will gain from this course will help you very much in your work as a talismanologist. When in the meditative state, you are aware of the work that you are going to do. Draw power from the universe while you know that you are getting stronger and stronger. 8. Make the Talisman Now you are ready to actually make the talisman. Again light the candle and project energy into it. Do this in the awareness that the candle is a symbol of the energies of light and of the fire element. Focus on the water and project energy into it. Then light the incense and energize it. Sitting in front of the table you take your piece of parchment and draw a square on it. The size of the square should be between 1 1/2 and 2 inches. Draw vertical and horizontal lines into the square so that you end up with a square that has five rows and five columns. Draw a circle around the square. Then put the letters into the square. After you have finished drawing, cut out the round talisman. 9. Charging the Talisman. If you have followed my instructions up to now, the talisman contains already a significant charge, and you will increase this charge to the maximum possible. You charge the talisman by slowly tracing all the lines and letters and projecting energy into it. You can use a pointed tool that you hold in your hands such as a toothpick. Trace the lines very slowly. While you trace them, you feel energy flow from your arm into the talisman. Feel the energy build up on it as you proceed with your tracing. Repeat the tracing of all lines and letters over and over again. From time to time hold the talisman two or three inches in front of the center between your eyes. You may notice some tingling or a similar sensation. This feeling will increase as you proceed charging the talisman. If you cannot feel the tingling you need not be discouraged. With practice you will find your best method to feel the energy buildup in an object such as a talisman. Keep charging the talisman until you feel good about the energy that you have accumulated in it. While charging it is best that you do not focus on the purpose of the talisman. Simply keep projecting energy into it.

Checking the Talisman When you have finished charging the talisman, you proceed by checking its power. Again you should put yourself in a state of universal consciousness, or alignment of the elements. Hold the talisman in your hand and wait for feelings, insights, ideas, visions, etc., that may come to you. Write your experiences down in your magical diary for future reference. 11. Wearing the Talisman Now that you have finished the talisman, you can use it. I recommend that you wrap it into paper or, better, silk and carry it with you in your pocket whenever you think you want its power. I suggest that you put your talisman away from you during the night and that you mentally disconnect from it. You can put the talisman into a glass jar with a glass lid for this purpose. In the following lesson, I am going to introduce you to planetary talismans. Planetary talismans are among the most widely used talismans. L ESSON 3 P LANETARY T ALISMANS The planetary talismans are among the most commonly used ones. As the name indicates, those talismans represent the energies of the planets. Usually, a planetary talisman is composed of several elements, each of which represents a specific energetic characteristic of the planet. In this and the next lesson, I will make you familiar with some of the most commonly used symbols found on planetary talismans and correlations of planets with numbers, metals, and colors. To make good planetary talismans, you need to know (i.e. learn) some important things about the planets themselves. Most important to know is the field of action of the planet. This is necessary, because the purpose of the planetary talismans is to help you achieve things that correspond to the field of action of a specific planet, such as art, love and beauty with Venus, war, sports and activity, mathematics with Mars, wealth with Jupiter, authority with the Sun, and intellectual pursuits with Mercury. The “traditional” planetary talismans, therefore, have specific fields of action, which you find described in the next chapter. This field may be narrowed down to more specific action by adding symbols of other energies to the talismans, which naturally is part of the work of a skilled talismanologist.

In fact, the most important method of effective self- improvement prior to the invention of the Welz Chi Generator ® resulted from new knowledge of the working of the human brain. It has been well established that every thought, feeling, sensation, and level of awareness has a corresponding brain wave pattern, or frequency. Consequently, you can determine the level of awareness that you want to harness for your success by controlling your brain waves. We know of Alpha, Beta, Theta, and Delta brain waves, all in the low frequency range from approximately 1 Hz to 30 Hz (cycles per second). Gamma frequencies are above 30Hz. This method of controlling brain waves with low frequency input is not new at all! In the 1930’s researchers found that repetitive light and/or sound stimulation caused brain waves to adjust to the same frequency. For decades now, some “new age gurus” and other cult leaders made extensive use of repetitive sound pulses, often of the inaudible and subliminal kind. This helps them to make their captive audiences more receptive to their preaching.

J UPITER The talisman of Jupiter is cherished by many people, because it helps to riches, honor, and glory. It also helps you become influential: Your opinions gain weight and are appreciated, the optimism that you radiate when carrying such a talisman can be “catching” and consequently it attracts likeminded optimistic people. Jupiter helps secure peace. The talisman of Jupiter provides a good feeling for religious things, law and order, and it makes conscientious."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"in time as the very dawn of humankind, shamans used drumming (repetitive beats of low frequency) to put their audiences into altered states where they had experiences that they would not have in their normal state of daily activities. In our times, this type of pulse, or “beat” is used in many events where the capturing of audiences and the temporary control of their habits and minds is considered to be important, such as in fashion shows, exercise machine advertising, TV commercials, military training, church meetings, and infomercial pitches to the public, to name just a few. You can find a variety of good Light-Sound (LS) devices on the market today. A LS-device typically stimulates the brain indirectly with light flashes through goggles and sound stimuli (beats) through earphones. These stimuli will cause the brain to adjust to the frequency of the flashes and sounds and consequently generate the corresponding level of awareness. All LS-devices have a serious flaw: They depend on earphones and goggles to be effective. In other words: if you want to access a specific level of awareness such as charismatic appearance, calm, or creativity, you need to get the stimuli through earphones and goggles. It is obvious that you cannot wear these LS- devices when you really need them! Just imagine appearing on a date, an important business meeting, or a sports event with an LS-contraption on your head! And you cannot do creative writing, or art, either while using an LS-device on your head. You need to wait until you can take it off your head, and then your brain waves most certainly will adjust back to their usual state. That’s exactly where an LPOG 2400 DL makes a big difference! By now it is well-established that the technology of the Welz Chi Generator ® is far superior over the conventional type light-sound mind machines. The reasons are obvious: You can set up The Welz Chi Generator ® to emit Low Pulse Orgone in the exact frequency of brain waves: Alpha, Beta, Theta, or Delta. When you are in a field of LPO (Low Pulse Orgone, or Chi), your brain can adjust to its frequency almost instantly and with ease. This is so, because the detour over sensory perceptions or questionable electric mini-shocks (as in a couple of more recent devices) is no longer necessary. Life force in brain wave frequencies means a more effective impact and therefore faster results. You achieve the corresponding states of mind almost in an instant !!! The most striking advantage of our LPO technology over conventional type mind machines is the fact that you can project LPO (Low Pulse Orgone) at any distance. Simply use a structural link such as the TC 99 Transfer Couple or the PBT 2400 Power Booster with Transfer Disk, put it into your pocket, set your generator at the desired pulse speed, and go to a business meeting, on a date, to the gym, to a sports competition, or anywhere else. In fact, nobody will notice your invisible helper. That’s all! You can relax or go about your usual business at any place. There is certainly no need for you to have those cumbersome and ridiculous goggles, earphones, or other contraptions, on your head ever again!

Mars gives power over your adversaries, and it can secure success in litigation. S UN The talisman of the Sun gives honor, good reputation, influence, power, and popularity. It helps generally in making your wishes come true. This talisman provides good circumstances and a long life. V ENUS The talisman of Venus makes attractive, especially to the other sex, and it causes love. This talisman is one of the ideal talismans for love, which is only surpassed by an individually designed love talisman. Venus is very favorable to actors, dancers, artists, jewelers, and to persons who are involved in arts and crafts. M ERCURY The talisman of Mercury activates the mind. It is good for speech, writing, authoring, studies, and travels. It is especially favorable to merchants, travelers, journalists, and authors. This talisman can be a great help in magical evocation of spirits. Therefore, many lodges require from their beginning members that they make this talisman as one of the first ones. M OON This talisman counteracts all dangers from the water element. It also protects against attacks during the night. The Moon helps you develop capabilities of clairvoyance and mediumistic powers. It favors all persons who are subject to continuous change, either by profession or position in life. T HE PLANETARY METALS The seven “traditional” planets correspond to their specific metal. Those metals contain the specific vibration of the planet. Therefore, it is useful to make a talisman with the specific metal of the planet. You can also make the talisman of a non metallic material. In this case, it is helpful to attach a chip of the planetary metal to the talisman. Planetary talismans made on metal are generally round. SATURN: Lead. Lead is easy to work with, but toxic. Therefore, it should not have contact with the bare skin. You may use parchment and draw a circle around the talismanic symbols, using a lead pin. Another way is to carry the talisman of Saturn in a little leather bag.

It can be engraved with any engraving tool. JUPITER: Tin. Tin is easy to work with, and it can be in touch with your skin. Therefore, you can work a Jupiter talisman as a pendant. Tin can be engraved with an engraving tool, or it can be etched with hydrochloric acid. MARS: Iron. Not to be confused with steel, which is an alloy of iron (Mars) with coal (Saturn). Iron can be etched with hydrochloric acid, or engraved with an engraving tool. SUN: Gold. Naturally, a good sized golden talisman will require a good sized amount of money. As a substitute you can use bronze. VENUS: Copper. It easy to work with and easy to etch. It is soft enough for engraving tools. Etching fluids for copper are commercially available. MERCURY: Its metal, mercury, is liquid, and very poisonous. Some metaphysicists suggest copper which is gold plated, using the metal mercury in the plating process. This process has some drawbacks, above all that hardly any business uses this method of gold plating. In our days, German silver is used, and brass. MOON: Silver. Silver is easy to work with, and its price is affordable. P LANETARY C OLORS Tradition ascribes colors to the planets. In the following, I will mention various colors with each planet. However, the first color mentioned is the color of the sign of the sign which is the daily throne of the planet. One exception: The Moon: its throne is cancer, which is a “night sign”. The whole question leads to the zodiacal colors of light energy and the zodiacal color shades of life energy, which would go beyond the scope of this lesson to be discussed here. You can use colors especially when you decide to make a planetary talisman on paper, parchment paper, or real parchment. SATURN: VIOLET (Aquarius), black, dark gray, dark green, dark brown. JUPITER: BLUE (Sagittarius), dark violet, dark blue, purple, burgundy. MARS: RED (Aries), red brown, orange, lilac. SUN: YELLOW (Leo), gold, brown yellow, light yellow, orange. VENUS: GREEN (Libra), pink, indigo, light green, blue. MERCURY: ORANGE (Gemini), yellow, gray.

In addition, each planetary number is the basis of a planetary square in which the numbers are arranged in such a very peculiar way: In a planetary square or magical square, the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is always the same. Each planet has four specific numbers: the first number is the number of the planet. The second is its square, which is the number of the planet multiplied by itself. The third number is the sum of a column, row, or diagonal, and the fourth number is the sum total of all numbers in the square. SATURN: Number of Saturn:3 The square: 9 Sum of the column, etc. : 15 Sum of all numbers: 45 Based on this, the four numbers of Saturn are: 3,9, 15, and 45.

The purpose of a Welz Chi Generator ® is the generating of life force, or Chi energy. Our programs are Power Radionics TM Programs, because you can connect them structurally with a Welz Chi Generator ® , which adds Power to your radionics operations. purpose of the orgone generator ® (Welz Chi Generator ® ) is to provide the radionics device with massive life energy in order to get far reaching results faster, easier, and more effectively than ever before! This combination of the new Welz Chi Generator ® with the radionics device, Power Radionics TM , opened the door to many new ways to benefit from radionics more effectively than ever before. For this reason, the new Power Radionics Devices and Power Radionics Programs are very effective tools with near-infinite potential! Why Power Radionics TM ? Power Radionics is a gigantic step ahead of all conventional radionics devices and radionics programs (see the diagrams on page 13): It adds massive life force to radionics. This means continuous power driving towards the results that you programmed into your computer. The continuous flow of life force is made possible with a special structural link that connects your life force generator (Welz Chi Generator ® ), the Power Radionics TM Program and the target of your operation: Therefore, each program comes with a fully individualized transfer card and the corresponding file on your program that connect the trend and target settings of your radionics device directly with the trend and target functions in your program. Another important feature that makes the Power Radionics Program much more effective than the rest is the fact that we included four settings in addition to the “Trend” and “Target” settings in the average radionics program: (1) an orgone transfer function to energize the Power Radionics Program (see above about transfer cards) ( 2) a basic energy (“Basic Action”) setting that boosts the trend-to-target connection with the principal energy field (3) a setting for a trend energy that is exerting an influence upon the environment of the target, for a more rapid overall success, and (4) a setting for an alternative target. This alternative target can also be used as a “grounding function” to prevent repercussion to the operator when the trend energy cannot reach the envisioned target for reason of interference, blockage, etc. You find these extremely important settings only in our Power Radionics Programs. The obvious lack of such overall flexibility naturally makes any other radionics program on today’s market inferior to the Power Radionics Programs from HSCTI !!! You can use the program by itself, especially when connected to an orgone generator (Welz Chi Generator ® ). It works best in conjunction with an orgone radionics device: the RAD 2000 or the RAD 2400 HD, and, especially, with the RAD 5 with its 5 heavy duty orgone generators ® , one for each setting of the RI 2400 CD. In fact, the RAD 5 was fashioned after the RI 2400 CD. The RI 2400 CD Radionics Program and Interface for PC About Power Radionics TM Radionics was first discovered a century ago. It is a technology that involves interaction with the human consciousness. This technology helps you to project at any distance energy (life force) and trends that give inclination to desired effects or results. In the transfer test you have experienced proof that distance is irrelevant in work with radionics. You can use the radionics device to project energy and trends to yourself and to others. This fact makes radionics a powerful tool in your hands, provided that you have the open mind to make use of this exceptionally effective technology. We have shown you that such projection is possible with the help of life force and structural links. This works as well in the case where such structural links are of a purely abstract nature in the form of radionics settings, or “rates”. In other words, the technology of radionics can now easily be explained as a direct consequence of the characteristics of life force: Its transfer at any distance by way of structural links and its negative entropy! Assumptions of “esoteric” speculations, or assumptions, such as non-measurable “frequencies”, “higher planes”, “astral energies”, “morphogenetic fields” and the like certainly are a thing of the past, obsolete, and no longer necessary for a scientific explanation of the amazing effects of radionics! Power Radionics TM is the logical consequence of this new understanding of radionics: While the purpose of the radionics device is the establishing of structural links, the Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Actually, you can run as many radionics operations simultaneously as you want and your computer permits.

The Timing You have your talisman designed. Now you want to determine the right time when to make the talisman. One of the most commonly used ways of timing a magical action such as making a talisman is following the system of planetary days and hours. According to this practice, a Venus talisman is best made on the day of Venus, which is Friday, during the hour of Venus. While there is agreement concerning the planetary days (after all, the days are named after planets), there are several methods of calculating the planetary hours. The system most in use begins the day of the planet at six p.m. 6-7 p.m. 7-8 p.m. 8-9 p.m. 9-10 p.m. 10-11 p.m. 11-12 p.m. 12-1 a.m. 1-2 a.m. 2-3 a.m. 3-4 a.m. 4-5 a.m. 5-6 a.m. 6-7 a.m. 7-8 a.m. 8-9 a.m. 9-10 a.m. 10-11 a.m. 11-12 a.m. 12-1 p.m. 1-2 p.m. 2-3 p.m. 3-4 p.m. 4-5 p.m. 5-6 p.m. S = Sun, M = Moon, H = Mercury (Hermes), V = Venus, A = Mars (Ares), J = Jupiter, K = Saturn (Kronos).

Cleansing the materials If you work with metal, you can cleanse with the four elements. The four elements are very important in talismanic work of the Western traditions. For more about them see the course in cosmic consciousness: http://www.meditrance.com. If you are not familiar with the four elements, there is no reason to panic. For now, it is sufficient for you to follow the procedures which are outlined below. The cleansing effect will be there no matter whether you are knowledgeable of the elements or whether you have absolutely no idea thereof. First, have the metal in a dish with sand, or earth, for a day. As you put the metal into the dish, you strongly visualize (imagine) that any impurity which pertains to the earth element will be absorbed by the earth or sand in the dish. Discard the earth after you have taken the metal disk out of it. Next, you put the disk in water for one day. Proceed the same way as with earth. Next, you heat the metal over a candle flame (with a pair of pliers, of course), strongly imagining that all impurities pertaining to the fire element are cleansed away, and last you cool the nmetal by swinging it through the air in circles. While you do that, you imagine that all impurities which pertain to the air element are blown out of the disc of metal.

This exact frequency module boasts a total of 10,000 settings. Its precision of 1/100,000 is unsurpassed. Advantages of the EPM 2400: The “Input EPU” jack on the heavy duty devices (the RAD 2400 HD and LPOG 2400 HD) leads to a second generator in the Heavy Duty orgone generating units. This second generator can be powered up with a pulse input from the EPM 2400. When having both generators running, you can more than double the power output of your heavy duty device. The advantages of this exact frequency generator are obvious: With it you can now set your generator output at any frequency that you desire, any frequency that best reflects your needs. This exterior precision pulse module has been designed to meet the requirements of persons who desire to set any frequency of their choice with absolute precision, stability, and reliability. This exact frequency requirement is desirable for specific purposes such as performance enhancement in sports, or when you work with a radionics system that is based on actual frequency settings. Therefore, you can use it in conjunction with a stick pad, pendulum or other device to determine frequencies that work very much like radionics rates. This way you can either set up a system of exact frequencies that reflect specific trends or you can use a book that gives you a list of these frequencies. The radionics qualities of this extraordinary device allow you to get a frequency rate either by rubbing a stick pad, then, when you feel the “stick”, by pushing the “random” button, or by releasing the other buttons to set frequencies whenever you feel the stick."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 47 If the material is paper or parchment, you proceed in a different way, of course. First, light a candle. Then, light some incense. A stick of frankincense is excellent. This is, so, because frankincense has superior cleansing qualities. Have a cup with water and a dish with earth on the altar. What follows is a process of imagination, as was with the metal disc. After a brief meditation, look at the paper or parchment. See it connected with the four elements which are symbolized by the objects on your table. Imagine that the impurities are drawn away for the talisman to be. Finally, take the talisman, hold it in your hand, and strongly blow on it, imagining that all impurities are blown out of it into their respective elements. Blow first, connecting with the fire element. Next connect with the air element, then with water, and finally with earth. Similar procedures apply to crystals and gemstones. Those may also be put into salt water for a day or so. Salt is a universal cleanser that absorbs impurities. Therefore, you can also use salt for metal and for paper or parchment. In this latter case salt is recommended, of course, and not salt water. When working with salt, be sure to imagine that the impurities will be absorbed. A focus on the four elements will enhance as well: First, imagine the impurities of fire being absorbed by the salt, then the impurities of the air element, then of the water element, and finally of the earth element. The cleansing, of course, has to be done before the time that you determined the making of the talisman. 3. The set up Clean off a table. On the table, put things representing the four elements: A candle, incense, a cup with water, and a dish with earth, or sand. Instead of the dish with earth, you can use a crystal. Arrange the objects as shown below. Now, set the Sator Arepo talisman that you made in lesson two on the table, at the center of the four elements. Your workspace is in front of the symbolism of the four elements. The Sator Arepo talisman serves as an intensifier of the planetary energies you will put into the talisman that you are going to make. If you make the Venus talisman that we described in the preceding lesson, you can begin with this at the hour of Venus on the day of Venus. Four hours are available for this purpose: Thursday evening from 6 to 7 p.m., Friday early morning from 1 to 2 a.m. (ideal!), Friday morning from 8 to 9 a.m., and Friday afternoon from 3 to 4 p.m. Have your parchment ready, and the green colored pen (Venus). 4. Drawing the talisman Enter a brief meditation. If you are familiar with the ONENESS meditation, or cosmic consciousness meditation, bring yourself into this state of alignment of the four elements. Now, begin to draw the talisman on the parchment. Draw slowly, and while drawing project energy into the talisman. You may imagine green Light being projected into the talisman with every line you are drawing. This way, you charge the talisman as you are drawing it. Green Light projection is especially easy and powerful on the day of Venus during the hour of Venus. The Sator Arepo talisman intensifies those energies. Your state of being ONE is a still more excellent support of what you are doing. 5. Further charging Ideally, after you finished drawing the talisman, you can go ahead and charge it even more. Mentally trace every line of the talisman, project energy into it, look at the various symbols and numbers. Proceed this way until you feel good about the result, or until the end of the hour of Venus."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com CONCLUSION In this course, you have gained a good impression of what is involved in the making of talismans and you have gained practical experience in doing so. The process of charging the talismans that you learned here is but one of many methods. Planetary talismans are very useful. Therefore I suggest that you make all seven for yourself. The talismans which you do not use, you put best in a glass or plastic jar with a glass or plastic lid. You may use the talismans selectively, depending on what you intend to do. It is an advantage for the beginner to carry one talisman at a time, and, preferably one talisman for several weeks. If you know your astrological chart, you have an idea which of the planetary talisman is the one you want to have your first experience with over an extended period of time. Otherwise, your personal needs will determine the talisman that you want: Jupiter for money, Venus for love, Mars for sports and competition, etc. If you have a very pressing, or a very specific, personal need, it may be useful if you get instructions to make a special talisman from a professional source. This way, you have a talisman with a very specific action rather than a planetary talisman whose action is broader and which is encompassing a variety of fields of life experiences. A PPENDIX In the previous lessons you learned about talismans and how to make them. You certainly realized that making talismans is not too difficult. The typical talismanologist has a wealth of symbols and talisman designs available. With this collection of symbols he or she can then custom tailor talismans for any individual for any purpose. The capability of astrology, the use of the pendulum or any other form of ideomotoric movement, and plain old intuition are valuable tools. You will acquire them with time as you will acquire the experience of how to tackle the various problems that your customers want to solve. I encouraged you to study the course “Magick of the Future”. If you did, you certainly have realized by now that a talisman is a structural link to a very specific trend energy. Once the link is fully established, the talisman is continuously powered by the life force of the person who carries it. When you use a talisman for an extended period of time, you connect it with trend energy other than its original charge, depending on your experiences while carrying it. These energies can counteract the effectiveness of the talisman. In older jargon, the talismanologist said that it took on some psychic clutter. These energies have to be removed from time to time, i.e., the talisman has to be cleansed from acumulated negativity and re-charged. You can cleanse the talisman in the same manner as you have been cleansing the utensils and the material for the talisman before you have made it. It is a cleansing that uses the four elements. You recharge the talisman the same way as you have charged it originally.

Although you do not carry it around with you, you are continuously connected with the trend energy that you have set on the device. This is so, because the device is not only set to connect with the trend energy, but it is also connected to the target person. The target person of the radionic operation is surrounded by a field of trend energy in the same way as the person who carries a talisman. If radionics alone is used, the trend energy is powered by the life force of the target person. An orgone radionics device functions as a universal talisman. Besides its near-infinite flexibility this modern technological approach has another advantage: It supplies the target with the life force that is necessary to connect it with the trend energy. In other words: with chi energy boosted radionics you have a universal talisman that is not only more flexible than any of the traditional talismans, but it also supplies life force continuously. Using Chi energy boosted radionics compares to traditional talismanology as modern transportation compares to walking, horseback riding and traveling in buggies. Most magicians prefer to use symbols in conjunction with orgone boosted radionics, either as filters on the device or in the radionics program for their PC. A symbol can connect with desirable characteristics of which the talismanologist has thought when making a talisman for the person who wears it. Many symbols possess inherent mechanisms of success and well being that we often overlook when simply setting the radionics device. With Chi energy boosted radionics devices you can carry something inconspicuous on you that acts as a powerful personal talisman at all times. Find out more about Chi energy boosted radionics before continuing to read here. Then you will understand better the instructions that follow. High-Power Talisman using Chi Energy Boosted Radionics Required: (1) An orgone boosted radionics device: RAD 2000, RAD 2400 HD or better. (2) Filter cards, symbols, or, if you have a PC, a radionics program such as the RI 2400 CD or the PR 2000. With the RAD 5 and a radionics program you can power up to 5 radionics operations at the same time. With the ATGS 3000 up to twelve. If you have one transfer diagram for each one of them, you can set up five different trend energies of your choice. Then you carry on yourself the diagram of your choice while you have the other diagrams away from your body, either in a brief case or in the glove compartment of your car. For instance, if you are traveling, you can set up 5 OBR talismans that run continuously. You can have one for extreme aggressiveness in one business negotiation where this is indicated, one for more charismatic and popular characteristics for business dinners or martini lunches, one for relationships and sex, and one to boost your performance and give you energy at the sometimes unavoidable golf game. (3) Any kind of transfer object such as a transfer disk. This is optional, since a target setting of the radionics device is sufficient in many cases. However, if you use a RAD 5 with up to five different talismanic forces acting, you want five different transfer disks, each one for a different action. The transfer disks, of course, have the advantage that you can select them when needed and put them away afterwards when you do not need any more the specific energy.
