And this is a book about those things. Long ago, the happemngs that made it into histories were the irregularities of experience: the unexpected, the catastrophic, and the ominous. Gradually, scientists came to appreciate the mystery of the regularity and predictability of the world. Despite the concatenation of chaoti- cally unpredictable movements of atoms and molecules, our experience is of a world that possesses a deep-laid consistency and continuity. Our search for the source of that consistency looked first to the 'laws' of Nature that govern how things change. But gradually we have identi- fied a collection of mysterious numbers which lie at the root of the consistency of experience. These are the constants of Nature. They give the Universe its distinctive character and distinguish it from others we might imagme. They capture at once our greatest knowledge and our greatest ignorance about the Universe. For, while we measure them to ever greater preClslOn, fashion our fundamental standards of mass and time around their invariance, we cannot explain their values. We have never explamed the numerical value of any of the constants of Nature. We have discovered new ones, linked old ones, and understood their crucial role in making things the way they are, but the reason for their values remain a deeply hidden secret. To search it out we will need to unpick the most fundamental theory of the laws of Nature, to discover if the constants that define them are fixed and framed by some over- arching logical conSistency or whether chance still has a role to play. Our first glimpses reveal a very peculiar situation. While some constants seem as if they will be fixed, others have the scope to be other than they are, and some seem completely untouched by every- thing else about the Universe. Do their values fallout at random? Could"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xiv The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e they really be different? How different could they be if life is to be possible in the Umverse? Back in 1981, my first book, The Anthropic Cosmological PrinCIple, explored all the then-known ways in which life in the universe was sensi- tive to the values of the constants of Nature. Umverses with slightly altered constants would be still-born, devoid of the potential to evolve and sustain the sort of organised complexity that we call life. Since that time, cosmologists have found more and more ways in which the Universe could exhibit variations in its defining constants; more and more ways in which life could have faIled to emerge in the Universe. They have also begun to take seriously the possibility and actuality of other universes in which the constants of Nature do take different values. Inevitably, we find ourselves in a world where things fell out right. But what was the chance of that happening? Here we shall look at many of these possibilities, connecting them to the curious history of our attempts to understand the values of our constants of Nature. Recently, one big story about the constants of Nature has produced a focus for media attention and detailed scientific research. It raises the most basic question of all: are the constants of Nature really constant after all? A new method of scrutinizing the constants of Nature over the last I I billion years of the Universe's history has been devised by a group of us. By lookmg at the atomic patterns barcoded into the light that reaches us from distant quasars we can look and see what atoms were like when the light began its journey billions of years ago. So, were the constants of Nature always the same? The answer, unexpected and shocking, raises new possibilities for the Umverse and the laws that govern it. This book will tell you about them.

In the world of scientific exploration the recognition of the impact of change is not so new. By the end of the nineteenth century it had been appreciated that once upon a time the Earth and our solar system had not eXisted; that the human species must have changed in appear- ance and average mental capability over huge spans of time; and that in some broad and general way the Universe should be winding down, becom1Og a less hospitable and ordered place. Dur10g the twentieth century we have fleshed out this skeletal picture of a changing Umverse. The climate and topography of our planet is continually changing and so are the species that live upon it. Most dramatically of all, we have discovered that the entire universe of stars and galaxies is in a state of dynamic change, with great clusters of galaxies flying away from one another into a future that will be very different from the present. We have begun to appreciate that we are living on borrowed time. CataclysmiC astronomical events are common; worlds collide. Planet Earth has been hit in the past by comets and asteroids. One day its luck will run out, the shield provided so fortuitously by the vast planet Jupiter, guarding the outer reaches of our solar system, will not be able to save us. Eventually, even our Sun will die. Our Milky Way galaxy will be drawn into a vast black hole deep 10 itS centre. Life like our own will end. Survivors will need to have changed their form, their homes and their nature to such an extent that we would be challenged to call their continued existence 'living' by our own standards today. We have recognised the simple secrets of chaos and unpre- dictability which beset so many parts of the world around us. We under- stand our changing weather but we cannot predict it. We have appreciated the similarities between complexities like this and those that emerge from systems of human interaction - societies, economies, choices, ecosystems - and from within the human mind itself.

But there is a sense in which all this change and unpredictabl1- ity is an illusion. It is not the whole story about the nature of the Universe. There is both a conservative and a progressive side to the deep structure of reality. Despite the incessant change and dynamic of the Visible world, there are aspects of the fabnc of the Umverse which are mysterious in their unshakeable constancy. It is these mysteri- ous unchanging things that make our Universe what it is and distin- guish it from other worlds that we might Imagine. There is a golden thread that weaves a continuity through Nature. It leads us to expect that certain things elsewhere in space will be the same as they are here on Earth; that they were and will be the same at other times as they are today; that for some things neither history nor geography matter. Indeed, perhaps without such a substratum of unchang10g reahties there could be no surface currents of change or any complexities of m10d and matter at alL These bedrock 10gredients of our Umverse are what this book IS about.

The loss was bad enough but when the cause was discovered it looked like a case for the force-feeding of humble pie. Lockheed-Martin, the company controlling the day-to-day opera- tion of the spacecraft, was sending out data about the thrusters in Imperial units, miles, feet and pounds-force, to mission control, while NASXs navigation team was assuming like the rest of the international scientific world that they were receiving their instructlOns in metrIc units.

Quantity was measured differently from country to country and conversion factors were needed, just as we change currency when travelling internationally today. Once international collaboration began on technical projects the stakes were raised. s Precision engmeering requires accurate inter-comparison of standards. It is all very well telling your collaborators on the other side of the world that they need to make an a1rcraft component that is precisely one metre long, but how do you know that their metre is the same as your metre? MEASURE FOR MEASURE PAROCHIAL STANDARDS 'She does not understand the concept of Roman numerals. She thought we just fought World War Eleven.' Joan Rivers' Onginally, standards of measurement were entirely parochial and anthropometric. Lengths were derived from the length of the king's arm or the span of his hand. Distances mirrored the extent of a day's journey. T1me followed the astronomical variations of the Earth and Moon. Weights were convenient quantities that could be carried in the hand or on the back. Many of these measures were wisely chosen and are still with us today in spite of the official ubiquity of the decimal system. None 1S sacrosanct. Each is designed for convenience in partic- ular circumstances. Many measures of distance were derived anthro- pomorphically from the dimensions of human anatomy. The 'foot' is the most obvious unit of this sort. Others are no longer so familiar. The 'yard' was the length of a tape drawn from the tip of a man's nose to the farthest fingertip of his arm when stretched horizontally to one side. The 'cubit' was the distance from a man's elbow joint to further- most fingertip of his outstretched hand, and varies between about 17 and 25 of our inches (0.44-0.64 metres) in the different ancient"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"8 The Constants of Nature cultures that employed it.? The nautical unit of length, the fathom, was the largest distance-unit defined from the human anatomy, and was defined as the maximum distance between the fingertips of a man with both hands outstretched horizontally to the side. The movement of merchants and traders around the Mediterranean region in ancient times would have highlighted the differ- ent measures of the same anatomical distance. This would have made it difficult to maintain any single set of units. But national tradition and habit was a powerful force in resisting the adoption of another country's standards. The most obvious problem with such units is the fact that men and women come in different sizes. Who do you measure as your standard? The king or queen is the obvious candidate. Even so, this results in a recalibration of units every time the throne changes hands. One notable response to the problem of the variation in human dimen- sions was that devised by David I of Scotland in I ISO to define the Scottish inch: he ordained that it was to be the average drawn from meas- urements of the width of the base of the thumbnail of three men: a 'mekill' [big] man, a man of 'messurabel' [moderate] stature, and a 'lytell' [little] man. The modern metric system of centimetres, kilograms and littes, and the traditional 'Imperial' system of inches, pounds and pints are equally good measures of lengths, weights and volumes so long as you can measure them accurately. That is not the same thing as saying they are equally convenient, though. The metric system mirrors our counting system by having each unit ten times bigger than the next smallest. Imagine having a counting system that had uneven jumps. So, instead of hundreds, tens and units we had a counting system like that used in England for non-technical weights (like human body weights or horse-racing handi- caps) with 16 ounces in one pound and 14 pounds in one stone.

Introducing new weights and measures brings with it a certain"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"JOURNEY TOWARDS ULTIMATE REALITY 9 upheaval in society and IS rarely received with unalloyed enthusiasm by the populace. The French Revolution therefore provided an occasion to make such an innovation without adding significantly to the general upheaval of everything else. s The prevailing trend of political thinking at the time sided with the view that weights and measures should have an egalitarian standard that did not make them the property of any one nation, nor give any nation an advantage when It came to trading with others. The way to do thiS was believed to define measure against some agreed standard, from which all rulers and secondary measures would be calibrated. The French National Assembly enacted this into law on 26 March 1791, with the support of Louis XVI and the dear statement of principle submitted by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand: 'In view of the fact that in order to be able to introduce uniformity of weights and measures it is necessary that a natural and unchanging unit of mass be laid down, and that the only means of extending this uniformity to other nations and urging them to agree upon a system of measures is to choose a unit that is not arbitrary and does not contain anything specific to any peoples on the globe.'9 Two years later, the 'metre'lO was introduced as the standard of length, defined as the ten millionth part of a quarter of the Earth's meridianY Although this is a plausible way to Identify a standard of length It is dearly not very practical as an everyday comparison. Consequently, in 1795, the units were directly related to specially made objects. At first the unit of mass was taken as the gram, defined to be the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at 0 degrees centigrade. Later It was superseded by the kilogram (1000 grams) defined as the mass of 1000 cubic centi- metres of water at 4 degrees centigrade. Finally, in 1799, a prototype metre bar l2 was made together with a standard kilogram mass and placed in the archives of the new French Republic. Even today, the reference kilo- gram mass is known as the 'Kilogramme des Archives'."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"10 The Constants of Nature Unfortunately, the new metric units were not at first successful and Napoleon reintroduced the old standards in the early years of the nineteenth century. The European politIcal situation prevented an inter- national harmonisation of standards. IJ It was not until New Year's Day 1840 that Louis Phillipe made metric units legally obligatory in France. Meanwhile they had already been adopted more universally in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg twenty-four years earlier, and by Greece in 1832. Britain only allowed a rather restricted use of metric units after 1864 and the USA followed suit two years later. Real progress only occurred in 1870 when the International Metre Commission was established and met in Paris on 8 August for the first time, to co- ordinate standards and oversee the making of new standard masses and lengths. 14 Copies of the standards were distrIbuted to some of the member states chosen by the drawing of lots. The kilogram was the mass of a special cylinder, 39 mm in height and diameter, made of an alloy of platinum and iridium 15 kept under three glass bell-jars and stored inside a vault at the International Bureau of Standards in Sevres near Paris. Its definition is simple: 16 'The kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram.' The British Imperial Units, like the yard and the pound, were defined similarly and standard prototypes were kept by the National PhysIcal Laboratory in England and the National Bureau of Standards in Washington DC. This trend for standardisation saw the creation of scientIfic units of measurement. As a result we habitually measure lengths, masses and times in multiples of metres, kIlograms and seconds. One unit of each gives a familiar quantity that is easily Imagmed: a metre of doth, a kilogram of potatoes. This convenience of size witnesses at once to their anthropocentric pedigree.

The result was an explosion of units of measure. Every type of material began to have its own standard of strength and tolerance, quantity and weight. Not only were these umts anthropocentric they were profession-centric as well. Brewers liked one choice of volume measure, water engineers another; jewellers measured weight differently to sailors and architects. When I was a child there was a common brand of lined exercise book that would be used for making notes at school. They always had red or blue covers and the outside back cover of the book listed all the peculiar Imperial meas- ures of length, area, capacity and weight (see Figure 2.2). For the engineer and the practical person of affairs this was convenient, useful and no doubt very profitable. But for anyone seek- ing an integrated natural philosophy it made human knowledge appear fragmented and idiosyncratic. A visitor from another planet would be perplexed by the need for different measures of weight when buying gold, apples or sealing wax. MAINTAINING UNIVERSAL STANDARDS 'There was a crooked man who built a crooked house.' Nursery rhyme By the second half of the nineteenth century, engineers, industrialists and scientists were becoming overwhelmed by the profusion of ad hoc units and measures. The industrial revolution had accelerated the devel- opment of every imaginable industry. Manufacturing, machining, meas- uring, designing, building - these were the rages of the age and they spawned more and more units."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"14 The Constants of Nature Within the halls of science the existence of standard lengths and masses was not entirely satisfactory for the purist either. Every time standard masses were handled with their special tongs their mass would be very slightly changed. It would vary slightly as atoms were evaporated from their surfaces or dust deposited from the atmosphere. They were not really constant. IS Nor were they universal. Suppose that a signal had been received from an engineer on another planet asking us how big we were. It would be no use sending an answer in metres or kl10grams and then responding to the Inevitable reply, 'What are they?' by telling our extraterrestrial correspondent that they were objects kept in glass containers in Paris. Unfortunately the quest for univer- sal standards had created examples which were neither standard nor umversal. WIthin science the drivmg force for rationalisation came from the study of electricity and magnetism. Different systems of units were in use by different groups of scientists and had different relationships with the traditional metric units for mass, length, time and temperature. The first general response to these problems came from Lord Rayleigh and James Clerk Maxwell. In hIS Presidential address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1870 Maxwell advocated the introduction of standards which are not tied to special objects, lIke standard metres l9 or kilograms kept in special conditions. For standards like these can never really be constant. The standard mass in Paris will lose and gain molecules all the time. Measures of time that are defined, like the day, by the rotation of the Earth or, like the year, by its orbit of the Sun likewise cannot be constant. As the rota- tion of the Earth slows, and our solar circuit changes, so these standards will very slowly drift. They may be defined in extrahuman terms but they are not candidates for ultimate standards.

Maxwell saw an opportunity to use the sameness of molecules to define standards absolutely: 'Yet, after all, the dimensions of our earth and its time of rotation, though, relatively to our present means of compar- ison, very permanent, are not so by any physical necessity. The earth might contract by cooling, or it might be enlarged by a layer of meteorites falling on it, or its rate of revolu- tion might slowly slacken, and yet it would continue to be as much a planet as before. But a molecule, say of hydrogen, if either its mass or its time of vibration were to be altered in the least, would no longer be a molecule of hydrogen. If, then, we wish to obtain standards of length, time, and mass which shall be absolutely permanent, we must seek them not in the dimensions, or the motion, or the mass of our planet, but in the wave-length, the period of vibra- tion, and the absolute mass of these imperishable and unal- terable and perfectly similar molecules [i.e. atoms].20 Maxwell was specially interested in molecules for many philo- sophical purposes. He recognised the significance of there existing populations of identical building blocks for all the material bodies we see around us. If we take any piece of pure iron it will be composed of a collection of identical iron molecules. The fact that these molecules appear to be identical is a remarkable feature of the world. Maxwell contrasted this invanance With the changeability and evolution of living things predicted by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Maxwell pointed to the molecules of Nature as entities that were not subject to selection, adaptation or mutation. His challenge was to find a way to exploit this Immutability and universality In the way that we define our units of measurement. In this way we would"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"16 The Constants of Nature be able to take a step away from the b1as introduced by the impera- tives of human convenience towards the deep invariances of physical reality. In 1905 the red light emitted by hot cadmium atoms 21 was first used as a standard against which to define a umt of length called the Angstrom (denoted by IA and equal to 10- 10 metre). One wavelength of the cadmium light was equal to 6438.4696 A. This was a key step because for the first time it defined a standard of length in terms of a universally constant feature of Nature. The wavelength of the light emitted by cadmium 22 is fixed by the constants of Nature alone. If we wanted to tell an extraterrestrial physicist our size, we could do 1t by saying what we mean by 18 billion wavelengths of red cadmium light. 23 A BRILLIANT IDEA! \"'Where did the matter come from?\" \"What is the difference? ...

Isaac Bashevis Singer\" In 1874, an unusual Irish physicist called George Johnstone Stoney found himself having to make sense of the Babel of practical units. He had been invited to deliver a lecture on units of measurement at the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Belfast. 25 This annual meeting still exists today but is now devoted to showcasing the developments in science for the general public, the Press and young people.

By studying Michael Faraday's experiments on electrolysis Stoney had even predicted 27 what its value must be - a prediction subsequently confirmed by J.J. Thomson who discovered the electron in Cambndge m 1897 28 and announced his discovery to the Royal Institution on 30 April. To this basic quota of electric charge Stoney eventually gave the name' electron' and the symbol E in 189 F9 (after first calling irJO the 'electrine' in 1874) and he never missed an opportunity to publicise its properties and potential benefits for science. 31 Stoney was also an older distant cousin of the famous mathe- matician, computer scientist and code-breaker, Alan Turing, whose mother recalled childhood memories of the unusual uncle the chl1dren called 'electron Stoney'.32 He was also the uncle of George FitzGerald, now famous for proposing the Lorentz-FitzGerald contractlOn of length, a phenomenon that was eventually understood within the context of Einstein's special theory of relativity. Stoney was also a practical man and worked for two years for the Earl of Rosse construct- 109 sensitive optical instruments for his private observatory at Birr Castle before becoming Professor of Natural Philosophy at Queen's College Galway in 1850. After his retirement he moved to Homsey 10 north London and continued publishing a steady stream of papers in the Royal Dublin Society's scientific journal. It is hard to find an Issue that doesn't contam a paper under his name, on every conceiv- able subject, we find everything from time travel to how bicycles stay upright. Stoney found the programme for the Belfast meeting of the British Association full of accounts of different units and standards: how to measure them; how best to define them; how to mter-relate them. This was all very useful for insiders but somewhat tedious for everyone else. Stoney saw an opportunity to simplify this vast perplexity of human standards of measurement and to do so in a way that would lend more weight to his electron hypothesis. Stoney had been a member of a British Association committee 33 which had determined conventions for electrical units in the years leading up to this conference, and so had"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"JOURNEY TOWARDS ULTIMATE REALITY 19 already been required to give some thought to the problems of umts and standards. Stoney recognised that his concept of the basic electromc charge unit provided the missing piece 10 a small puzzle. Suppose that one wanted to devise units of mass, length and time that were not attached to purely human standards of convenience, like the pound or the mile or the fortnight. Then they needed to be derived from some aspect of the underlying fabric of the Umverse that was not anthropocentric, that did not depend on where you are located when you measure it, or when the measurement was made. This ruled out traditIOnal approaches to standards which took a standard mass of a kilogram or a length of a metre and kept them in a specially controlled environment somewhere and just compared other reference masses or lengths to them. These masses and lengths are anthropocentric 10 origin but, what is worse, they are anthropocentric in principle because there is no way in which to tell extraterrestrials how much mass or length defines our standard Without sending It to them. In order to escape the shackles of anthropocentric bias Stoney looked to the constants of phySICS to supply something that might transcend human standards of quantity. Newton had discovered that gravity obeys an apparently universal law. The force between two masses whose centres are separated by a distance is proportional to each of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centres. The constant of proportionality should be the same everywhere in the universe. 34 This constant, G, gives a measure of the strength of gravity. The important thing about it is that it is believed to be constanr3 5 - the same value should be found everywhere it is correctly measured. Moreover, It has a strange value when expressed in our convenient anthropocentric units (G = 6.67259 X 10- 11 m 3 s- Z kg- l ) because those units were devised for other anthropocentric purposes. The second constant of Nature that Stoney appealed to for hiS non-anthropocentric standards was the speed of light, c. Aga1O, this quantity transcends human standards. It has a fundamental significance."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"20 The Con 5 I a n I 5 0 f N a I u r e In fact, it has an even more fundamental significance than Stoney could ever have known. Einstein showed that the speed of light 10 a vacuum should act as the ultimate speed limlt in the Umverse - no information can be sent faster. It had also been discovered that the product of the permeability and permittivity of space that defined different units of electricity was equal to the square of the speed of light, so revealing its special universal status with respect to electric- ity as well. To these two constant quantities Stoney added his own candidate for the third great constant of Nature - his basic electron charge, which we now label by the symbol e. It was the last piece needed to complete the jigsaw. It fitted the bill in the same way as G and c. It was presumed to be umversal. It was associated with a fundamental aspect of the structure of Nature. And it didn't care about human convenience. Stoney announced his trinity of constants like this: 36 'Nature presents us with three such units and that if we take these as our fundamental units, instead of choosing them arbitrarily, we shall bring our quantitative expressions into a more convenient, and doubtless into a more intimate, rela- tion with Nature as it actually exists. For such a purpose we must select phenomena that prevail throughout the whole of Nature, and are not simply associated with individual bodies. The first of Nature's quan- tities of absolute magnitude to which I will invite attention is that remarkable velocity of an absolute amount, inde- pendent of the units in which it is measured, which connects all systematic electrostatic units with the electromagnetic units of the same series. I shall call this velocity VI [i.e. our c]. If it were taken as our unit velocity we should at one stroke have an immense simplification introduced into our treatment of the whole range of electric phenomena, and probably into our study of light and heat."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"JOURNEY TOWARDS ULTIMATE REALITY 21 Again Nature presents us with one particular coeffi- cient of gravitation, of an absolute amount independent of the units in which it is measured, and which appears to extend to ponderable matter of every description through- out the whole material universe. This coefficient I shall call G I [i.e. our G]. If we were to take this as our unit of coef- ficients of attraction, it is presumable that we might thereby lay the foundation for detecting wherein lies the connection which we cannot but suspect between this most wonderful property common to all ponderable matter, and the other phenomena of nature. And, finally, Nature presents us in the phenomenon of electrolysis, with a single definite quantity of electricity which is independent of the particular bodies acted on . . . This definite quantity of electricity I shall call E, [i.e. our e]. If we make this our unit quantity of electricity, we shall probably have made a very important step in our study of molecular phenomena. Hence we have very good reason to suppose that in VI' G I , and E l , [i.e. c, G and e] we have three of a series of systematic units that in an eminent sense are the units of Nature, and stand in an intimate relation with the work which goes on in her mighty laboratory. We have thus obtained ... the three great fundamen- tal units offered to us by Nature, upon which may be built an entire series of physical units deserving of the title of a truly Natural Series of Physical Units.' In his talk Stoney referred to the electron as the 'electrine' and gave the first calculation of its expected value. 37 He showed that the magic trio of G, c and e could be combined in one way, and only one way, so that a unit of mass, a unit of length and a unit of time are created from them.

Although a mass of 10- 7 gram is not too outlandish, similar to that of a speck of dust, Stoney's units of length and time were unlike any that had been encountered by SCIen- tists before. They were fantastIcally, almost mconcelvably, small. There was (and still IS) no possibIlity of measuring such lengths and times directly. In a way, that is what one might have expected. These units are deliberately not constructed from human dimensions, for human convenience, or for human utility. They are defined by the very fabric of physical reality that determines the nature of light, electricity and gravity. They don't care about us. Stoney had succeeded brilliantly in his quest for a superhuman system of units. But, alas, they attracted little attentIOn. There was no practical use for his 'natural' units and theIr significance was hidden to everyone, even Stoney himself, who was more interested In promoting his electron up until its discovery in 1897.

And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.' Max Planck\" Stoney's idea was rediscovered in a slightly different form by the German physicist Max Planck, in 1899. Planck is one of the most important physicists of all time. He discovered the quantum nature of energy that launched the quantum revolution in our understanding of the world and provided the first correct description of heat radiation (the so called 'Planck spectrum') and has one of the fundamental constants of Nature named after him. He was a central figure 10 physics of hiS time, won the Nobel prize for physics in 1918, and died in 1947 aged 89. A quiet, unassuming man, he was deeply religious 40 and greatly admired by his younger contemporaries, like Einstein and Bohr. Planck's conception of Nature placed great emphasis upon its mtrinsic rationality and mdependence of human thought. He believed in an intelligence behind the appearances which fixed the nature of re- ality. Our most fundamental conceptions of Nature needed to be aware of the need to identify that deep structure which was far from the needs of human utility and convenience. In the last year of his life he was asked by a former student if he believed that the quest to unite all the constants of Nature by some deeper theory was appealing. He replied with enthusiasm, tempered by realism about the difficulty of the challenge: 'As to your question about the connections between the universal constants, it is without doubt an attractive idea to link them together as closely as possible by reducing these various constants to a single one. I for my part,"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"24 The Constants of Nature however, am doubtful that this will be successful. But I may be mistaken. '41 Unlike Einstein, Planck did not really believe in any attainable all-encompassing theory of physics which would explain all the constants of Nature. For if such a theory arrived then physics would cease to be an inductive science. Others, like Pierre Duhem and Percy Bridgman, regarded the promised Planckian separation of scientific description from human conventions as unattainable in principle, view- ing the constants of Nature and the theoretical descriptions that they underpin entirely as artefacts of a particular human choice of repre- sentation to make sense of what was seen. Planck was suspicious of attributing fundamental significance to quantltles that had been created as a result of the' accident' of our situ- ation: 'All the systems of units that have hitherto been employed, including the so-called absolute C. G. S. system [centi- metre, gram and second, for measuring length, mass and time], owe their origin to the coincidence of accidental circumstances, inasmuch as the choice of the units lying at the base of every system has been made, not according to general points of view which would necessarily retain their importance for all places and all times, but essen- tially with reference to the special needs of our terrestrial civilization . . . Thus the units of length and time were derived from the present dimensions and motion of our planet, and the units of mass temperature from the density and the most important temperature points of water, as being the liquid which plays the most important part on the surface of the earth, under a pressure which corresponds to the mean properties of the atmosphere surrounding us. It would be"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"J 0 URN E Y Tow A R 0 5 LJ L TIM ATE REA LIT Y 25 no less arbitrary if, let us say, the invariable wave length of Na-light were taken as unit of length. For, again, the particular choice of Na from among the many chemical elements could be justified only, perhaps, by its common occurrence on the earth, or by its double line, which is in the range of our vision, but is by no means the only one of its kind. Hence it is quite conceivable that at some other time, under changed external conditions, every one of the systems of units which have so far been adopted for use might lose, in part or wholly, its original natural signifi- cance.' Instead, he wanted to see the establishment of 'units of length, mass, time and temperature which are independent of special bodies or substances, which neces- sarily retain their significance for all times and for all environments, terrestrial and human or otherwise'.42 Whereas Stoney had seen a way of cutting the Gordian knot of subjectivity in the choice of practical units, Planck used his special units to underpm a non-anthropomorphic basis for physics and 'which may, therefore, be described as \"natural units\": The progressive revela- tion of thiS baSiS was for him the hallmark of real progress towards as far-reaching a separation as possible of the phenomena in the exter- nal world from those in human consciousness. In accord with his universal outlook, in 1899 Planck proposed 43 that natural umts of mass, length and time be constructed from the most fundamental constants of Nature: the gravitatiOn constant G, the speed of light c, and the constant of action, h, which now bears Planck's name. 44 Planck's constant determines the smallest amount by which energy can be changed (the 'quantum'). In addition, the incorporation of Boltzmann's constant, k - which simply converts umts of energy"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"26 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e into units of temperature - allowed him also to define a natural temper- ature. 45 Planck's units are the only combinations of these constants which can be formed with the dimensions of mass, length, time and temperature. Their values are not very different from Stoney's: I1\"lp1 = (hc/GY I2 = 5.56 X 10- 5 gram ~I = (Gh/c 3 y I2 = 4.13 X 10-33 centimetres li>1 = (Gh/ c 5 Yl2 = 1.38 X 10-43 seconds Again, we see a contrast between the small, but not outrageously small natural unit of mass and the fantastically extreme natural units of time, length and temperature. 46 These quantities had a superhuman significance for Planck. They cut into the bedrock of physical reality: 'These quantities retain their natural significance as long as the law of gravitation and that of the propagation of light in a vacuum and the two principles of thermodynamics remain valid; they therefore must be found always to be the same, when measured by the most widely differing intelligences according to the most widely differing methods.' He alludes in his closing words to the idea of observers elsewhere in the Universe defining and appreciat10g these quantities 10 the same way as ourselves. 47 For the time, there was something quite striking about Planck's units, as there was also about Stoney's. They entwined gravity With the constants governing electricity and magnetism. Gravity had always been a largely uneventful branch of physics. Newton had apparently found"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"J OUR N E y Tow A R a S U L TIM ATE REA LIT y 27 the law of gravity and very few questions were asked about it thereafter. True, there were annoying small discrepancies between its predictions and the observed wobble of the planet Mercury as it orbited close to the Sun. Some had even suggested making a tmy change to Newton's law to explain it but most astronomers expected that small effects from the non-spherical shape of the Sun or errors in the observations might rescue Newton. It seemed to be a finished story. By contrast, there was continual progress and debate about the laws of electricity and magnetism. They began looking like separate laws for static electricity (that makes your hair stand on end), dynamic electricIty (that makes currents flow), and magnetism. But gradually the two electricities were found to be different complexions of one elec- tric force. And then Maxwell showed that electricity and magnetism were really different sides of the same coin: moving magnets could make electrical currents flow and electric currents could create magnetIc forces. But never did gravity seem to impinge upon electricity and magnetism or the behaviour of atoms and molecules. As a result we see that there existed a very different view to that of Planck and Stoney about natural umts. The physiCIst Paul Drude, a leading contributor to the study of electromagnetic waves, optics and materials, held the prestigious professorship of physics at Leipzig. In 1897 Drude proposed 48 a system of absolute units of mass, length and time that were tied to the properties of the aether that was then believed to permeate all space. His choice of standards were the velocity of light, and the average distance travelled by the particles of the aether before they mteracted. Drude could then see no way49 for gravity to be linked to electricIty and magnetism and so did not follow Stoney and Planck in devising natural units contaming G. Even for Planck, the entry of G into his natural units was a mystery. He offered no explanation as to the meaning of the tiny Planck units of length and time. What did they mean? What would happen if you looked at the world on these dimensions? It would be a long time before these questions were asked 50 and far longer before they were answered."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"28 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e PLANCK GETS REAL 'The increasing distance of the physical world picture from the world of the senses means nothing but a progressive approach to the real world.' Max Planck We have seen how Max Planck appealed to the eXistence of universal constants of Nature as evidence for the existence of a physical reality that was quite distmct from human minds. But he wanted to go much further and use the existence of these immutable constants as an argu- ment agamst positivistic philosophers who thought science was entirely a human edifice: measured points organised in a convenient way by a theory that will eventually be replaced by a better one. Planck appreciated that the writmg of equations and the formulation of phys- ical theories was a human activity, but that does not mean that it is nothing but a human activity. For him, the constants of Nature had emerged uninvited and, as hiS natural umts clearly showed, were not chosen for human convemence alone. He writes: 51 'These ... numbers, the so-called \"universal constants\" are in a sense the immutable building blocks of the edifice of theoretical physics. So now we must continue with the question: What is the real meaning of these constants? Are they, in the last analysis, inventions of the inquiring mind of man, or do they possess a real meaning independent of human intelligence?

Therefore, up to quite recently, positivists of all hues have also put up the strongest resistance to the introduction of atomic hypotheses and thereby also to the acceptance of the above mentioned universal constants. This is quite understandable, for the existence of these constants is a palpable proof of the existence in nature of something real and independent of every human measurement. Of course, even today a consistent positivist could call the universal constants mere inventions which have proved to be uncommonly useful in making possible an accurate and complete description of the most diversified results of measurement. But hardly any real physicist would take such an assertion seriously. The universal constants were not invented for reasons of practical convenience, but have forced themselves upon us irresistibly because of the agree- ment between the results of all relevant measurements, and - this is the essential thing - we know quite well in advance that all future measurements will lead to these selfsame constants.' There were many more options open to Planck's opponents, of course. It might have been that the constants he chose were not truly constants at all when scrutinised with vastly greater precision. They might be varying very slowly, perhaps by only a few parts per million over the age of the Universe. Or, it might be that they are only constant in some statistical or average sense. Smce these possibilities carmot be excluded except by assumption or prejudice there needs to be a detailed experi- mental study of constants and their constancy.

For, amusingly, at the end of the nineteenth century, it was widely believed that all the interesting discoveries had already been made in physics and all that remained was to measure with greater and greater accuracy - an enter- prise of polishing rather than of discovery or revolution. Caricaturing this hubns, Albert Michelson wrote 10 1894 that there was a view abroad that 'The more important fundamental laws and facts of physical science have all been discovered, and these are now so firmly established that the possibility of their ever being sup- planted in consequence of new discoveries is remote ... Our future discoveries must be looked for in the sixth place of decimals. '52 Even Planck had been influenced by these views. As a student in 1875 he recalled that his tutor advised him to work in blOlogy because all the important problems of physics were solved and the subject was fast approaching completeness. Ironically, Planck was the leader in creating the new quantum view of reality that was then followed by Einstein's assaults on our conceptions of space, time and gravity.

He played a major role 10 creating the correct perspective upon the atomic and quantum character of the small-scale world of matter, showed how the speed of light introduced a relativity into each observer's view of space, mass and time, and single- handedly found the theory of gravity that superseded the classic picture created by Isaac Newton 250 years before. He was always fascinated by the way in which some things must always look the same, no matter how the viewer is moving. The prime example that he displayed was the speed of light moving in a vacuum. No matter how fast the source of a light beam is moving relative to you, after it emits its light you will always measure the light to have the same speed relative to you."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"34 The Constants of Nature This is completely unlike any everyday motion at low speed that we are familiar with.

But fire a light beam from a train moving at the speed of light (300,000 kilometres per second) and it will be found to move at the speed of light relative to the ground. The speed of light is a special constant of Nature. It is the benchmark against which we can judge whether motiOn is 'fast' or 'slow' in some absolute sense. All over the Universe we expect that the speed of light plays the same basic role. It is a cosmiC speed limit: no 1OformatiOn can be transferred faster than the speed of light in vacuum. 3 Einstein had many interesting things to say about the constants of Nature at different stages of his life. It was his elucidation of the theory of relativity that endowed the velocity of light 10 vacuum with its special status as the maximum speed at which information could be transmitted in the Universe. He revealed the full extent of what Planck and Stoney had merely assumed: that the velocity of light was one of the fundamental superhuman constants of Nature. In the second half of his life, he became 10creasingly absorbed with a search for the ultimate theory of physics. He called it a 'unified field' theory whereas today it would be called a 'Theory of Everything'.4 Alas, physicists now believe that Einstem achieved very little in that period of intense investigatiOn, as he constantly tned to find a bigger and better theory than his general theory of relativity: one that would include other forces of Nature than gravity.5 He believed that such a theory eXisted and its umqueness and completeness would leave no mathematical loose ends. Consequently, it would have the smallest possible number of constants of Nature 6 which could then only be found by experiment. Einstein was not really happy for there to be any free constants like this at all. He realised that the search for the ultimate theory was a process of finding better and better theories which superseded the"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"SUPERHUMAN STANDARDS 35 previous one. At present our theories are provisional and so there are a number of free constants of Nature appearing in them which we just have to measure. Ultimately, this situation would change.

E1Oste1O wrote almost nothing about these ideas in his published articles and other scientific writings. Yet he maintained a lifelong cor- respondence with an old student friend, Ilse Rosenthal-Schneider (pictured in Figure 3.1), who was interested in the philosophy ,of SCience and was a close friend of both Planck and Emstein 10 her youth. She and her husband emigrated to Sydney to escape from Nazi Germany in 1938. For a period, between 1945 and 1949, the personal letters between Einstein and Rosenthal-Schneider focused on the question of constants of Nature. Einstein th10ks carefully about his explanations and provides a clear and full statement of his beliefs and hopes for the future of physics. Rosenthal-Schneider first wrote? to Einstein about constants in 1945. What are they? What are they telling us about the lawfulness of Nature? Are they all related?

There is then the possibility that it might be a number that could be calculated in terms of quantities like 1t or any of the other numbers of mathematics. Rosenthal-Schneider replies 9 and mentions the ideas of Planck, with whom she studied as a student, about the three special constants that he used to create his 'natural' units: 'However, I am still worrying - and that is why I pester you again with my questions - about what are the universal constants as Planck used to enumerate them: gravitational constant, velocity of light, quantum of action, ... which are not dependent on external conditions like pressure, temperature, ... and which therefore are pleasantly distinct from the constants of irreversible processes? If all these were entirely non-existent, the consequences would be catastrophic, If I understood Planck correctly he regarded such universal constants as \"absolute quantities.\" If now you were to state that they are all non-existent, what at all would be left for us in the natural sciences?

If they are all illusory, what bedrock is there for physical reality; why does the Umverse seem to be the same from one day to the next?

Einstein notices that they tend to appear in physical formulae but their values are neither very large nor very smalJ:l/ they are never very different from the number I.

These are those which, in the logi- cal development of mathematics, appear by a certain neces- sity as unique individual formations. e.g., e = I + I + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... It is the same with 1t, which is closely connected with e. In contrast to such basic numbers are the remaining numbers which are not derived from 1 by means of a perspicuous construction. It would seem to lie in the nature of things that such basic numbers do not differ from the number I in respect of the order of magnitude, at least as long as consideration is confined to \"simple\" or, as the case may be, \"natural\" formations. This proposition, however, is not fundamental and not sharply definable.' But Einstein knows that these basic numbers are not the most mter- esting constants of Nature. Einstein explains that the usual constants, hke the speed of light, Planck's constant, or the gravitation constant,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"SUPERHUMAN STANDARDS 39 have dimensions of different powers of mass, length and time. From them we can create combinations which are pure numbers but we might need to introduce other quantities to do it. He says, 'Now let there be a complete theory of physics in whose fundamental equations the \"universal\" constants CI' ... c n occur. The quantities may somehow be reduced to gm. cm. sec. The choice of these three units is obviously quite conven- tional. Each of these CI' ... C n has a dimension in these units. We now will choose conditions in such a way that CI' C2' C3 have such dimensions that it is not possible to construct from them a dimensionless product CaIC~2CY3' Then one can multi- ply C4CS, etc., in such a way by factors built from powers of CI' C2' C3 that these new symbols, CÂ·4 , cÂ·s, CÂ·6 are pure numbers. These are the genuine universal constants of the theoretical system which have nothing to do with conventional units. Suppose his CI, Cz, C3 are Planck's c, h and G, then there IS no way to combine them m powers so that you can get a pure number with no dimensions. 13 To do that you need to multiply by some other dimen- sional constants of Nature. For example, by multiplying G/hc by the square of some mass, for example the mass of a proton, we get the pure number Gmp//hc, say cÂ· 4 , which is approximately equal l4 to IQ-38. The 'starred' number we have just created is made by measuring some constant of nature with umts of a mass by Planck's mass. We could make others by dividing some time by Planck's time or some length by Planck's length. It is these pure 'starred' numbers that Emstem regards as the most fundamental. It does not matter what units are employed to measure them or to express them, they will always have the same value. Where do they come from? What fixes them? Why IS Gmp//hc about equal to 10- 38 , rather than to 10 3 or IO-68?

But I cannot imagine a unified and reasonable theory which explicitly contains a number which the whim of the Creator might just as well have chosen differently, whereby a qualitatively different lawfulness of the world would have resulted. Or one could put it like this: A theory which in its fundamental equations explicitly contains a non- basic constant would have to be somehow constructed from bits and pieces which are logically independent of each other; but I am confident that this world is not such that so ugly a construction is needed for its theoretical compre- hension.' Elsewhere, Emstein, is famously quoted as saying what really mterests him is whether 'God had any choice in making the world'. What he meant by that cryptic statement is made clear by the extract from his letter to Rosenthal-Schneider. He wants to know whether the dimen- sionless constants of Nature could have been given different numeri- cal values without changing the laws of phySICS or whether there is only one pOSSible choice for them. Going further he might wonder whether different choices in their values are possible for different laws of Nature. We still don't knoW. 16 The illuminating exchange of letters With Rosenthal-Schneider on constants ends on 24 March 1950 with Einstem reiterating his 'reli- glOus' view that God did not have any choice when it came to the fundamental constants and their values:"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"SUPERHUMAN STANDARDS 41 'Dimensionless constants in the laws of nature, which from the purely logical point of view can just as well have differ- ent values, should not exist. To me, with my \"trust in God\" this appears to be evident, but there will be few who are of the same opinion.' As we leave Einstein's thoughts about the inevitability of the constants of Nature it is interesting to pick up on the view of other great physicists who have been drawn to speculate about the significance and attainability of a final understanding of their values. Take George Gamow, the eccentric Russian physicist who risked his life escaping from the Soviet Union to live and work in America, where he became one of the founders of modern cosmology and even contributed to the early understanding of the DNA molecule and the genetic code. Gamow, like all his contemporaries, could see that there were four distinct forces of Nature (gravity, electromagnetism, weak and strong forces). The strength of each would create one of Einstein's pure numbers that define the world. Gamow was not drawn especially into the issue of whether they could have only one quartet of possible values. But for him a full under- standing of those values - an ability to calculate or predict them precisely - would be hke the wavmg of the chequered flag to a phYSicist. They would have attained a complete understanding of the forces of Nature when that day happened. Gamow is a little depressed at the prospect, like reaching the end of a great story, or sitting at the summit of a mountain one has striven to scale, for 'If and when all the laws governing physical phenomena are finally discovered and all the empirical constants occur- ring in these laws are finally expressed through the four independent basic constants, we will be able to say that physical science has reached its end, that no excitement is left in further explorations, and that all that remains to a physicist is either tedious work on minor details of the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"42 The Constants of Nature self-educational study and adoration of the magnificence of the completed system.

One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.' J R R Tolkien 18 The interpretation of the natural units of Stoney and Planck was not at all obvious to physicists. Aside from occasional passmg remarks it was not until the late I960s that the renewed study of cosmology led to a full appreciation of these strange standards. One of the curious problems of physics is that it has two beautifully effective theories - quantum mechanics and general relativity - but they govern different realms of Nature. Quantum mechanics holds sway in the microworld of atoms and elementary particles. It teaches us that every mass in Nature, however solid or pointlike it may appear, has a wavelike aspect. This wave is not like a water wave. It is more analogous to a crime wave or a wave of hysteria: it is a wave of information. It tells you the probability that you will detect a particle. If an electron wave passes through your detec- tor you will be more likely to make a detection, just as you are more likely to be robbed if a crime wave hits your neighbourhood. The quan- tum wavelength of a particle gets smaller the more massive the par- ticle. Situations are dominated by quantum waviness when the quantum wavelength of their partiCipants exceeds their physical Size. Everyday objects, like cars and speeding cricket balls, have such high masses that"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"SUPERHUMAN STANDARDS 43 their quantum wavelengths are vastly smaller than their sizes and we can forget about quantum influences when driving cars or watching cricket matches. By contrast, general relativity was always necessary when dealing with situations where anything travelled at a speed at, or close to, the speed of light or where gravity IS very strong. It IS used to describe the expansion of the universe and the behaviour of extreme situations like the formation of black holes. However, gravity is very weak compared with the forces that bind atoms and molecules together and far too weak to have any effect on the structure of atoms or sub-atomic particles. As a result of these properties, quantum theory and gravitation govern different kingdoms that have little cause to talk to one another. This IS fortunate. No one knows how to join the two theories together seamlessly to form a new, bigger and better editiOn that could deal with quantum aspects of gravity. All the candidates remain untested. But how can we tell when such a theory is essential? What are the limits of quantum theory and Einstein's general relativity theory? Fortunately, there IS a simple answer and Planck's units tell us what it is. Suppose we take the whole mass inside the visible Universe l9 and determine ItS quantum wavelength. We can ask when this quantum wavelength of the visible Universe exceeds Its size. The answer is when the Umverse is smaller than the Planck length In size (IQ-33 cm), less than the Planck time in age (I ()-43 secs), and hotter than the Planck temperature (10 32 degrees). Planck's units mark the boundary of appli- cability of our current theories. To understand what the world IS like on a scale smaller than the Planck length we have to understand fully how quantum uncertainty becomes entangled with gravity. To under- stand what might have gone on close to the event that we are tempted to call the beginning of the Universe or the beginning of time we have to penetrate the Planck barrier. The constants of Nature mark out the frontiers of our existing knowledge and show us where our theories start to overreach themselves."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"44 The Constants of Nature In the recent attempts that have been made to create a new theory to describe the quantum nature of gravity a new significance has emerged for Planck's natural Units. It appears that the concept we call 'information' has a deep significance in the universe. We are used to living in what is sometimes called 'the information age'. Information can be packaged in more electronic forms, dispatched more quickly and received more easily than ever before. The progress we have made in processmg information quickly and cheaply is commonly displayed in a form which enables us to check the predictiOn of Gordon Moore, the founder of Intel, called Moore's Law (see Figure 3.2). In 1965, Moore noticed that the area of a transistor was being halved approx- imately every 12 months. In 1975 he revised this halvmg time to 24 months. This is 'Moore's Law': that every 24 months you get about twice as much computer cirCUitry, running at twice the speed, for the same price because the cost of mtegrated circuit remains roughly constant. The ultimate limits that we can expect to be placed upon infor- mation storage and processing rates are imposed by the constants of Nature. In 1981, an Israeli physicist, Jacob Bekenstem, made an unusual prediction that was inspired by what he knew from the study of black holes. He calculated that there is a maximum amount of mformatiOn that can be stored mSide any volume. This should not surprise us. What should is that the maximum value is just determined by the surface area surrounding the volume, not the volume itself The maximum number of bits of information that can be stored in a volume is just given by computing its surface area in Planck units. Suppose that the region is spherical. Then its surface area is just proportional to the square of its radius, while the Planck area is proportional to the Planck Figure 3.2 Moore's Law shows the evolution of computer processing speed versus time. Every two years the number of transistors that can be packed into a given area of integrated circuit doubles. This biennial halving of transistor size means that the computing speed of each transistor doubles every two years for the same cost."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"... ,...... 41 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Â§ o â¢ - I\\. - 1\\ r--.. 1 \\ 1 - - - ~"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"46 The Constants of Nature length squared (I Q-66 cm 2 ).

Similarly, there is an ultimate limit on the rate of process- mg of information that is imposed by the constants of Nature. It is also very remarkable that we are able to use the Planck and Stoney units to classify the whole range of structures that we see in the Universe, from the world of elementary particles up to the largest astronomical structures. These are shown in Figure 3.3. The struc- tures shown on this picture are the stable entitles that exist in the Universe. They exist because they are stable balancing acts between competing forces of attraction and repulsion. For example, in the case of a planet, like Earth, an equilibrium arises between the attrac- tive crushing force of gravity and the atomic repulsion that arises when atoms are squeezed too close together. All these equilibria can be roughly expressed in terms of two pure numbers created from the constants e, h, c, G and m pr There are three interesting things to say about this picture. First we notice that most things lie along a straight line running diagonally upwards from lefr to right. Thls lme corresponds to the track of constant density that is equal to what we call 'atomic density'. Everything that is made of atoms has a density quite close to the density of a smgle atom given by the mass of an atom divlded by lts volume. 20 Second, there are some large empty areas in this picture. If we add to the plcture the lme defin- ing where black holes and thelr intenor regions sit then we take out the whole of the top lefr triangle of the picture. Nothing from this region could be seen. Its gravity would be too strong to allow light to escape. Similarly, nothing in the bottom lefr corner tnangle would be detectable. This 'quantum region' contains objects which are so small that the act of observing them would perturb them mto another part of the picture."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"... ,...... \" â¢ I â¢ I I '. \". , â¢ .. â¢ .. -_._- ,- R&u<* u 1\\t,...\"..

Because he was videoing the game and didn't want to know the result.' Angus Deayton 12 The identification of dimensionless constants of Nature like a and ~, along with the numbers that play the same defining role for the weak and strong forces of Nature encourages us to think for a moment about worlds other than our own. These other worlds may be defined by laws of Nature which are the same as those which govern the Universe as we know It but they will be characterised by different values of dimensionless constants. These numencal shifts will alter the whole fabric of the imaginary worlds. The balances between their forces will be different from those in our world. Atoms may have different prop- erties. Gravity may play a role in the small-scale world. The quantum nature of reality may enter m unexpected places. The legitimacy of thiS little thought experiment is closely linked to Einstein's deep questions. If the laws of Nature allow one and only one set of the values for the constants of Nature then the fteedom we appear to have to consider worlds m which they are different is merely a consequence of our relative Ignorance. We thmk there IS fteedom to change their values without constraint only because we do not under- stand the extent to which those values are hardwired into the forms of the laws themselves. On the other hand, If the constants are not umquely fixed by the one and only possible form for the laws of Nature then there may exist other worlds where they take different values."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"SUPERHUMAN STANDARDS 49 The last important lesson we learn from the way that pure numbers like a define the world is what it really means for worlds to be differ- ent. The pure number that we call the fine structure constant and denote by a is a combination of the electron charge, e, the speed of light, c and Planck's constant, h. At first we might be tempted to think that a world in which the speed of light was slower would be a different world. But this would be a mistake. If c, h and e were all changed so that the values they have in metric (or any other) units were different when we looked them up in our tables of physical constants, but the value of a remained the same, this new world would be observationally indistinguishable from our world. The only thing that counts in the defi- nition of the world are the values of the dimensionless constants of Nature. If all masses are doubled m value you cannot tell because all the pure numbers defined by the ratios of any pair of masses are unchanged. THE SUPER-COPERNICAN PRINCIPLE â¢A physicist is a mathematician with a feeling for reality.' Norman Packard 23 The name of the great Polish astronomer, Nicolaus Copermcus, is linked forever with the move to relinquish the presumption that the Earth is at the centre of things. For Copernicus himself it was the assumption, held for thousands of years, that the Earth was at the centre of the solar system that was the focus of attention. Copernicus constructed a picture of the motions of the planets around the Sun in which the Earth was no longer central. In time this heliocentric model proved the superior description of what was seen by astronomers, surpassing the explanatory power of the ancient Earth-centred picture of Ptolemy and hiS successors."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"50 The Constants of Nature The lffipact over the following centuries of Copernicus' leap away from the prejudices of anthropocentrism was felt across the whole spec- trum of human investigation. We began to appreciate our place In the Universe was by no means central. Indeed, in many respects, it appeared to be almost peripheral. The march towards established constants of Nature that were not explIcitly anthropocentric, but based upon the discovery and definition of universal attributes of Nature, can be seen as a second Copernican step. The fabnc of the Universe and the pivotal structure of her universal laws were now seen to flow from standards and invanants that were truly super- human and extraterrestrial. The fundamental standard of tune in Nature bore no simple relation to the ages of man and woman, no link to the periods of days, months and years that defined our calendars, and was too short to allow any possibility of direct measurement. There was a third step still to be taken in this extenslOn of the Copernican perspective. It was to show that the laws of Nature displayed a CopernIcan complexion. This is a much subtler matter and reqUIred one of Einstein's greatest insights to carry it out. First, what does it mean? Einstein argued that the laws of Nature should appear to be the same for all observers In the Universe, no matter where they were or how they were moving. If they were not then there would exist pnvI- leged observers for whom the laws of Nature looked simpler than they did for other observers. Such a view would be anti-Copernican; it would give someone (not necessarily us on Earth) a special posItion In the Universe. At first one might think that haVing universal constants of Nature based on superhuman phYSIcal standards would be enough to ensure that things looked the same to everyone. However, this is far from sufficient. A classic case is provided by Newton's famous laws of motion. Take the first law as an example. It tells us that bodies acted upon by no forces do not accelerate. They remain at rest or move at constant velocity. However, as Newton appreciated very clearly, this famous 'universal' law is not really universal. It will only be found to"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"SUPERHUMAN STANDARDS 51 be true by a speCial class of observers m the Universe - those which are called 'mertial' observers. Inertial observers are those who are not accelerating or rotating relative to an imaginary cosmic background stage of space defined by the most distant stars. 24 These observers there- fore violate the Copernican imperative. They see a Universe whose laws are especially simple. To see why this is so, imagine that you are located inside a spaceship out of whose windows you can observe the unchang- ing distant stars. Now suppose that the rocket boosters are fired so as to make the spaceship rotate. If you look out of the wmdows you will see the stars rotating (in the opposite sense) across the expanse of space. These stars wtll therefore appear to be accelerating25 even though they are not being acted upon by any forces. Newton's law will not be seen to hold for this rotating, non-inertial, observer. By working a little harder the rotatmg observer can find the law that governs what he sees from hiS rotating vantage point but it is more complicated than the law seen by inertial observers. This undemocratic situation, that allowed some observers to see simpler laws of Nature than others, struck Einstein as a clear sign that there was something imperfect about the way Newton chose to express his laws of Nature. They could not be truly universal laws of Nature if they only held for special observers. Emstein enunciated what he called the Principle of Covariance: that laws of Nature should be expressed m a form that wIll look the same for all observers, no matter where they are located and no matter how they are moving. When it came to implementing this Principle Einstem was very fortunate. During the latter part of the nineteenth century, pure mathematiCians in Germany and Italy had been extremely busy developing a detailed understanding of all the possible geometnes that could exist on curved surfaces. In doing that they had developed a mathematical language which automatically had the property that every equation possessed a form that remained the same if the co- ordinates describing it were changed in any way at all. This language was called the tensor calculus. Such changes of co-ordinates amount to askmg what type of equation would be seen by someone moving in"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"52 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e a different way. One of Einstein's oldest friends was a mathematician called Marcel Grossman who was well mformed about all these new mathematical developments. He showed Einstein this new mathemat- ics of tensors and gradually Einstein realised that it was exactly what he needed to give a precise expression to his Principle of Covariance. So long as he expressed his laws of Nature as tensor equations they would automatically possess the same form for all observers. This step by Einstein completes a dramatic movement in the physicist's conception of Nature that has been completed in the twen- tieth century. It is marked by a steady march away from there being any preferred View of the world, whether it be a human view, an Earth- based view, or a view based upon human standards. It has been brought about in stages. First, the Copernican revolution in astronomy gave rise to the view that our position in the Universe and the vantage point that we occupy in space and time is not specially privileged. Next, we have seen the creation of units of measurement and constants of Nature which are not reflections of human dimensions or the local astro- nomical motions of the Earth and the Sun. Instead, they are founded upon universal constants of Nature that transcend the human dimen- sion. Last, we have seen how Einstein recognised that the laws of Nature themselves must be formulated in a way that ensures that any observer in the Universe, no matter where they are or how they are movmg, should find the same laws to hold. These steps have depersonalised physics and astronomy in the sense that they attempt to classify and understand the things in the Universe with reference only to principles that hold for any observer anywhere. If we have identified those constants and laws correctly then they provide us with the only basis we know upon which to begin a dialogue with extraterrestrial intelligences other than ourselves. They are the ultimate shared experience for everyone who inhabits our Universe."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"chapter four Deeper, The Quest for a Theory of Everything Further, Fewer: 'Physicists are trained to investigate a problem before arriv- ing at a decision.

The unpredictable aspects of things were dangerous and fearfUl. Perhaps they were punish- ments rained down by the gods to show their displeasure at human behaviour. They were also remarkable; as a result, ancient chronicles have a lot to say about plague, disaster and pestilence. Less newsworthy, but"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"54 The Constants of Nature ultimately more significant, were the metronomic predictabilities of Nature. By noting and exploiting the periodic changes in the environ- ment, crops could be grown, stocks laid in for the winter, and defences made against the Incursions of wind and water. These regularities of Nature mirrored the regularities that structured stable societies and engendered a belief in law and order on a cosmic scale. Eventually, aided by the monotheistic faiths of many Western societies,3 these ideas nurtured the idea that there exist things called 'laws of Nature' that hold at all times and in all places. These universal laws prescribe how things will behave not, like human laws, how they ought to behave. We have come to appreciate that laws of change can always be replaced by the requirement that some other aspect of Nature does not change - called a conservation principle or an invariance of Nature. Energy is believed to be a prime example. It can be exchanged and reshuffled into different forms but, at the end of the day, when all the totting up is done the total must always be the same. By the I970s physicists had become so impressed by this corre- spondence between laws of Nature and unchanging patterns that they began to explore the catalogue of unchanging patterns to seek out candidates for the associated laws of change. Their search was extremely successful. The four basic forces of Nature - gravity, electricity and magnetism, radioactivity and nuclear interactions - were all descnbed by working theories of this sort. Each of these four forces of Nature corresponds to a separate pattern which is preserved when anything happens In Nature: when a radioactive nucleus decays or a moving magnet in your bicycle dynamo produces an electric current. All this was good news for physicists. By the mid I970s they had separate theories of gravity, electromagnetism, the weak force (from which radioactivity derives) and the strong force (from which nuclear forces derive) which agreed with all observed events. The preser- vation of an unchanging pattern in each case required the respective force of Nature to exist and determined In detail how, and on what, it should act."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"FURTHER, DEEPER FEWER THE QUEST FOR A THEORY OF EVERYTHING 55 But still they were unhappy.

Any suggestion that the Universe might be a mixture of different laws that are unrelated in any respect smacks of a world that is a botched job. Of course, this is no proof that the Universe really is a harmo- nious single piece of legislation or a collection of occasionally conflict- ing principles. 4 Indeed, as the United States discovered about their Constitution after their presidential election in 2000, one might beheve the former yet discover that the reality is closer to the latter. However, untd there is real evidence to the contrary, scientists wisely assume that whatever is responsible for the patterns that we call the 'laws of Nature' is a good deal smarter than we are and will not have missed neat and beautiful patterns that are evident to us. Nor is this humble belief merely a piece of pious self-denial. It is based upon past experience. Time and again we have found that the laws of Nature are cleverer, more abstract, and less arbitrary than we had previously imagined. This belief in the ultimate simplicity and unity behind the rules that constrain the Universe leads us to expect that there exists a single unchanging pattern behind the appearances. Under different conditions this single pattern will crystallise into superficially distinct patterns that show up as the four separate forces governing the world around us. It has gradually become clear how this patterning probably works. We have learnt that the forces of Nature are not as distinct as they first appear. They seem to have very different strengths and to act upon different elementary particles. But this is an illusion created by our need to inhabit a place in the Universe where the temperature is rather low - low enough for atoms and molecules to exist. As the temperature nses and the elementary particles of matter collide with one another at higher and higher energies, the separate forces that govern our quiescent low-temperature world become more and more alike. The"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"56 The Constants of Nature strong forces get weaker and the weak forces get stronger. New par- ticles appear as higher temperatures are reached and they mediate inter- actions between the separate families of particles which, at low temperatures, appear to be isolated from one another. Gradually, as we reach those ummaginable conditions of the 'ultimate' temperature that Max Planck found defined by the four constants of Nature, G, k, c and h, we expect the distinctions to have been completely effaced and the forces of Nature will finally present a single united front. COSMIC CUBISM 'There may be said to be two classes of people in the world: those who constantly divide the people of the world into two classes and those who do not.' Robert Benchley' The Soviet physicist George Gamow created a memorable fictional hero in a sequence of books that charted the exploits of Mr e.G.H. Tompkins, a bank clerk with an irrepressible interest in modern science 6 (see Figure 4.1). Gamow's device for explaining the novel aspects of quantum physics and relativity was to create a fictional world where the effects were magnified enormously. In effect, this is done by changing the values of the constants of Nature. If the speed of light were to become 186 miles per hour rather than 186,000 miles per second 7 then the peculiar effects of motion upon the rate of passage of time and the measurement of distance would become features of everyday experi- ence. You couldn't drive a car without being fully aware of them. Similarly, if Planck's constant were very much larger then the quantum wavelike aspects of matter would be constantly evident.

Our cube has eight corners and each one repre- sents a different physical theory. The simplest is at the origin of the graph where gravity is not included (G = 0), no quantlsatlOn is included (h = 0) and relativity is ignored (1/c = 0): this is Newtoman mechan- ics (NM). Moving vertically up the 1/ c axis leaving h = G = 0, we encounter the theory of special relativity (SR). Moving horizontally along the h axis, leaving I/c = G = 0 we generalise Newton's mechan- ics to quantum mechanics (QM). Adding gravity by moving along the G axis we reach Newton's theory of gravity (NG). Moving upwards, leaving h = 0, we reach Einstein's general theory of relativity (GR), and it can also be reached by adding graVity to special relativity. Similarly, moving upwards from quantum mechamcs by incorporating a finite value of 1/ c, we reach quantum field theory (QFT). Moving across the floor, so II c = 0 still, we reach the quantum version of Newtonian gravity (NQG). Finally, the last unvisited corner of the cube is a theory that is relativistic, gravitational, and quantum (TOE). It is a generalisation of all other theories. It has yet to be found.

The picture we have just created reveals a profound truth about the way in which progress occurs in science. Mature scientific progress is not a succession of revolutions which tear up old theories to make room for new ones. If that were true then the only thing about our current theones that we could be sure about is their incorrectness. Eventually, they will all be shown to be wrong.

In the first fifteen years of this century, Einstein found a deeper theory that could deal with fast motion and strong gravity when Newton's theory failed. But, crucially, Einstein's broader and deeper theory turns into Newton's when motions are slow and gravity is weak. It was the same with the revolutionary quantum theories that were found in the first quarter of this century. They provided a more complete description than Newton of the way the world works when we probe the realm of the very small. Their predictions about the non-Newtonian microworld are stupendously accurate. But again, when they deal with large objects they become more and more like Newton's description of motion. ThiS is how the core of truth within a past theory can remain as a limiting part of a new and better theory. Scientific revolutions don't seem to happen any more. If we look at our cube of theones again we can see the inter- relationships between old and new theories. Take our case that quan- tum mechanics becomes Newtonian mechanics as h approaches zero. This limit corresponds to a situation In which the quantum wavelike aspects of particles become negligible. And this is why we can be completely confident that Newton's three-hundred-year-old theories of motion and gravity will be taught and used just as effectively in 1000 years time as they are today.

Real advances in our understanding of the physical world always seem to mvolve either: (i) Rtvelation: The discovery of a new fundamental constant of Nature; (ii) Elevation:The enhancement of the status of a known constant; (iii) Reduction: The discovery that the value of one constant of Nature is determined by the numerical values of others;"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"62 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e (iv) Elucidation: The discovery that an observed phenomenon is governed by a new combination of constants; (v) J1anation: The discovery that a quantity believed to be a constant of Nature is not truly constant; or (vi) Enumeration: the calculation of the value of a constant of Nature from first prmciples, showing that its value is explamed. As an example of revelation, we recall how the introduction of the quantum theory by Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg and others intro- duced us to the new fundamental constant, h, that bears Planck's name. It gave a finite numerical value to something that was previously assumed to be zero: the smallest energy change that can be observed in Nature. Another more recent example is suggested by the development of a candidate for the title 'theory of everything', called superstring theory, in which the fundamental ingredients of the world are not point par- ticles of mass but loops, or strings, of energy which possess a tension, rather like elastic bands. This string tension is the basic defining constant of the theory. Almost all other properties of the world follow from it (although they are yet to be worked out in most cases). This string tension may prove to be as fundamental as the Planck umts of mass and energy. As an example of elevation, we see how Einstein's development of the theory of special relativity gave a new universal status to the veloc- ity of light in vacuum, c. Einstein showed that it provides the lmk between the concepts of mass (m) and energy (E) through his famous formula E = mel. Einstein did not discover that light moved with a finite speed. That had been observed long before and preCise measure- ments of the speed of light had been made in the nineteenth century."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"FURTHER DEEPER, FEWER THE QUEST FOR A THEORY OF EVERYTHING 63 But Emstein's new theory of motion changed the status of the speed of light m vacuum forever. It became the ultimate speed limit. No information can spread faster. More fundamental still, it was the one velocity that all observers, no matter what their own motion, should always find to be the same. It was unique amongst all velocities. The discovery of a reduction is something that usually comes later m the game than either revelation and elevation. We already need to know some candidate constants; then we need to develop a broader explana- tlOn that lmks together their domains of application. Often, the constants defining each of the areas that are made to overlap will be found to be linked. This is typically what happens whenever physicists manage to create a theory that 'unifies' two, previously distinct, forces of Nature. In 1967, a theory was proposed by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam that linked electromagnetism and the weak. force of radioactiv- Ity. This theory was successfully tested by observation for the first time in 1983 and it links together the constants of Nature that label the strengths of the forces of electromagnetism and radioactivity. The links serve to reduce the number of independent constants that are believed to exist. The discovery of an elucidation is slightly different to that of a reduction, but equally revealing. It occurs when a theory predicts that some observed quantity - a temperature or a mass, for example - is given by a new combination of constants. The combination tells us something about the inter-relatedness of different parts of sCience. A good example is provided by Stephen Hawking's prediction, in 1974, that black holes are not entirely black. Thermodynamically, they are black bodies: perfect radiators of heat radiation. Prior to then it was believed that black holes were just cosmic cookie monsters, swal- lowing everything that came within their gravitational clutches. Once you fell mSlde a surface known as the event horizon, there was no return to the outside world. Hawking succeeded in discovering what would happen if quan- tum processes were included in the story. Remarkably, black holes then"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"64 The Constants of Nature turned out to be not quite black. The strong change in gravity near the event horizon could turn the gravitational energy of the black hole into particles which could be radiated away from the black hole, gradually sapping the mass of the hole, until it disappeared in a final explosion.1 3 What is unusual about this evaporation process is that it is predicted to be governed by the simple everyday laws of thermodynamics that apply to all known hot bodies in equilibrium. Thus black holes turn out to be objects that are at once gravitational, relativistic, quantum mechanical and thermodynamical. The formula whlch glves the temper- ature of the radiation that a black hole of mass M radiates away into space by means of Hawking's evaporation process involves the constants G, hand c. But it also includes the thermodynamic constant of Boltzmann, k, which links energy to temperature. This is a spectacular elucidation of the interlinked structure of superficlal dlsparate pleces of Nature. The discovery of a variation is quite different to the previous fonr developments. It means that a quantity which we believed to be constant is discovered to be an imposter, masquerading as a true constant. It varies in space or in time. Generally, such a step will require the vari- ation to be very small, or the quantity would not have been believed to have been constant in the first place. None of the fundamental constants of Nature have so far indubitably suffered this downgrading of thelr cosmic status. However, as we shall see later on, some are under suspicion as they have had their constancy probed to greater and greater levels of precision. The pnme suspect for tiny variations has always been the gravi- tatlonal constant, G. Gravity is far and away the weakest force of Nature and the least closely probed by experiment. If you look up the known values of the major constants in the back of a physics textbook you will dlscover that G is specified to far fewer decimal places than c, h or c. In the mid 1960s it was thought for a time that Einstein's general theory of relativity disagreed with observatlons of the motion of the planet Mercury around the Sun. The first thing that was done to"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"FURTHER, DEEPER, FEWER THE QUEST FOR A THEORY OF EVERYTHING 65 reconcile the two was to extend Einstein's theory by allowing G to change with time. Ultimately, the problem was traced to incorrect obser- vatIOns but, like a genie, once the varying-G theory was released it couldn't be shut up again. Although G has withstood assaults on its constancy for longest, the most recent and detailed attacks have been launched against the constancy of ex, the fine structure constant. They are so topical that we will be looking at them in more detail in Chapter 12. The fine structure constant is a linkage of the speed of light, Planck's constant and the electron charge. If it varies then we may choose to which of these we attribute the time variation. All of these five touchstones of progress revolve around constants of Nature and they show the central role that constants play in our appraisal of progress. There is a sixth development on our list. We called it mumeration. This is the Holy Grail of fundamental physics and it means the numencal calculation of one of the constants of Nature. This has never been done. So far, the only way we can know their values is by measuring them. I4 This seems unsatisfactory. It allows the constants that appear in our theories to have a huge range of differ- ent possible values Without overthrowing the theory. This is not the situation that Einstem imagmed when we heard him speak in the last chapter. He thought that the true theory should only permit one choice for the constants that define it - the values we observe. Some people share his view today, but it has become increasmgly apparent that not all the constants that define the world need be uniquely strait-jacketed in this way. It is likely that some are determined in a more liberal fash- ion by quantum randomness. Many people hope that a complete theory would allow us to calculate the numerical values of some constants, like c, h and G, as accurately as we liked. This would also be a wonderful way of testing such a 'complete' theory. So far, this is just a dream. None of the constants that we believe to be truly fundamental has been calculated in this way from one of the theories in which it appears. Yet, such a"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"66 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e calculation may not be too far away. Just a few years ago physicists were at an Impasse with several possible string theories on offer, all seeming to be equally viable Theories of Everything. This was odd. Why did our Universe use just one of them? Then Ed Witten of Princeton University made a major discovery. He showed that all these superficially different string theories were not different at all. They were just different limiting situations of a single, bigger, deeper theory which we have yet to find. It is as if we are illuminating a strange object from many different angles, casting different shadows on a wall. From enough of these shadows It should be possible to reconstruct the illuminated object. This deep theory is the M theory introduced earlier in this chapter. Hidden within its mathematical defences is an explanation for the numerical values of the constants of Nature. So far, no one has been able to penetrate them and extract the informa- tion. We know a little about the structure of the M theory but the mathematics needed to elucidate it is formidable. Physicists are used to being able to take mathematics that mathematicians have already developed and use it like a tool to fashion physical theories. For the first time since Newton patterns have been encountered in Nature that require the development of new mathematics in order to further our understanding of them. Witten believes we have been lucky to stum- ble upon M theory about fifty years too early. Others might point to the warning that the most dangerous thing in science is the idea that arrives before its time. Despite the lack of a fundamental theory with which to pursue a calculation of constants there has been no lack of numerological efforts to explain them. This is an activity that has a history, anthro- pology and sociology all of its own.

Epitaph\" Lucky numbers, unlucky numbers, special numbers -lots of people think they can count on them. Here is a modern remnant of an ancient super- stition. If we look back to about 550 Be we find Pythagoras and hiS Greek disciples carrying out some of the earliest studies of mathemat- ics for its own sake. They were interested in everything about the Universe to which number could be attributed. This was a way of linking these disparate parts of the world together, making the planetary motions into a musical scale, and turning quantities into geometrical shapes. Unlike us they didn't thmk that numbers were just attributes of things. They thought that everything was number. Numbers had intrinsic meanings. They were not just relationships between things. From these reltgious beliefs there followed a quest to explore the numbers of things in all possible ways, looking for coinCidental links between numbers in one area of life and another. Some numbers had good properties, others were bad. Some needed to be kept secret, others could be told to all. To see how Pythagoras was led to this strong belief in numerol- ogy we should consider some of the games he liked to play With numbers. One of his favourites was the sequence of triangular numbers. Here we can see how a simple pattern of numbers can emerge rather naturally once pebbles or other counters are placed on the ground. If we place successive rows of one, two, three ... dots below each other then we construct a progression of numbers which are 'triangular' in form (see Figure 4.3)."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"68 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e 3 6 10 â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Figure 4.3 Ihangular numbers are created by laying down rows if dots with one more dot than in the row above. 16 Add them up row by row to form the progression of triangular numbers: I, I + 2 = 3, I + 2 + 3 = 6, I + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, and so onY This was particularly illuminating to the Pythagoreans because the Greeks denoted numbers by letters of their alphabet and this obscured the patterns in the sequence of numbers that are immediately evident to us. Pythagoras' pictorial representations of the triangles of numbers was fascinating. Indeed, we see a memory of it today when we refer to numbers as 'figures'. A figure still carnes the dual meaning of a picture and a number. From this followed a picture of I as a point, 2 as a line joining two points, and 3 as a triangle, the first plane figure enclosing an area. The number 4 then symbolised the first sohd figure, a pyramid composed of four triangular surfaces with four corner pomts. In the same way, it was possible to speak of 'square' numbers, 4, 9, 16, 25 ... which can be built up by dots laid out in square arrays. Alternatively, they noticed that they could be built up by adding together successive odd numbers, so for example,18 4 = I + 3 9=1+3+5 16 = I + 3 + 5 + 7 25 = I + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 36 = I + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + I I and so on"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"FURTHER, DEEPER, FEWER THE QUEST FOR A THEORY OF EVERYTHING 69 These examples show how Pythagoras was drawn to make his first imaginative leap and regard numbers as things - geometrical objects. Next, he made an even more impressive discovery. He noticed that the tuning of Greek musical instruments depended upon simple numeri- cal ratios, 1:2, 3:2, 4:3 and 8:9. These were the only musical intervals that the Greeks regarded as consonant and appealing to the ear. The impact of this discovery on Pythagoras' thinking was far-reachmg. He thought that he had discovered that changes in human sense percep- tions were dependent on mathematics. Moreover, the appearance of similar numbers in the description of musical intervals and the motion of the planets convinced the Pythagoreans that these superficially differ- ent phenomena are intimately linked. What lies at the root of numerology is a belief that there is some- thing intrinsically meaningfUl about the numbers themselves; that seven- ness is a shared quality that links together all things that have a sevenfold quality, whether they are seven brides and seven brothers or the seven days of the week. It is a small step for some numbers, like 13, to be thought unlucky, or others, like 7, to be thought propitious. The Pythagoreans endowed certain numbers with special attributes, like goodness or justice. They became symbols in more ways than one. Here is a typical commentary: 'Because they assumed, as a defining property of justice, requital or equality, and found this to exist in numbers, therefore they said that justice was the first square number for in every kind the first instance of things having the same formula had in their opinion the best right to the name. This number some said was 4, as being the first square, divisible into equal parts and in every way equal, for it is twice 2.

'Perfect' numbers were so called because they have the remarkable property that they are equal to the sum of all the numbers that divide them exactly, apart from themselves. The first perfect number is 6 = I + 2 + 3, the second is 28 = 14 + 7 + 4 + 2 + I. The next two are 496 and 8 I 28 and were also known to the early Greeks. Even today only about 33 are known 20 and nobody knows if there are infinitely many of them, as there are prime numbers. 21 Pythagoras was also much impressed by a succeSSlOn of numbers which he called' amicable' . Two numbers are called' amicable' if the sum of the divisors of the first number is equal to the second number, and vice versa. In some sense they were judged to have the same 'parents' and the divine would look more favourably upon things that were numbered by pairs of these friendly numbers. For example 220 and 284 are amicable numbers. 22 You can divide 220 by 1,2,4, 5, 10, II, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110. Add them up and you get 284. You can diVide 284 by I, 2, 4, 71 and 142.

There were millions of viewers and we expect quite a lot of wind-up clocks will be stop- pmg as he speaks. Those households where a clock stops are terribly impressed. The rest just think they can't have been psychically tuned in enough. After all, he did manage to stop a lot of other clocks. My favourite numerical coincidence is one that my literary friend Stephen Medcalf told me about as an example that would defy any attempt to evaluate the mathematical likelihood of it arising by chance. I think it was noticed by an Eton schoolboy about seventy years ago. First, a little background which I am not able to judge. There is a tradition, or legend, that William Shakespeare had a hand in produc- ing the English renderings of some of the Psalms in the Authorised King James Version of the English Bible. 28 It was suggested that his hand is detectable in the Psalm 46, written in the year when Shakespeare was 46. For, as the schoolboy noticed. the 46th word ftom the begin- ning of this psalm 29 is 'shake'. The 46th ftom the end is 'spear'. Coincidence or hidden signature? All sorts of numerical coinCldences which incorporate the values of some of the constants of Nature can be found in the literature of science and vastly more in the in-trays of physicists where they have arrived from well-meaning correspondents. Here are a few of the proposed formulae (none are taken seriously) for the fine structure constant. Compare them with the best experimental value: experimental: I/a. = 137.035989561 ... First, there have been attempts to 'prove' that I/a equals the follow- ing expressions using a speculative extenslOn of known physics: Lewis and Adams 30 I/a = 81t(81t 5 /15)I!3 = 137.348 Eddington 31 I/a = (16 2 -I 6)/2 + 16 + I = 137"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"74 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e Wyler 2 1/a = (81t\" /9)(2 4 5!/1t S )l/4 = 137.036082 Aspden and Eagles 33 1/a = 1081t(8/l843)l/6 = 137.035915 Of course, if M theory eventually comes up with a determination of the value of 1/ a it might well look rather like one of these specula- tive formulae. However, it would supply a large and consistent theor- etical edifice from which the prediction would follow. It would also need to make some predictions of things that we have not yet meas- ured, for example the next few decimal places of 1/ a, that future exper- imenters could search out and check. All these pieces of numerical gymnastics are impressively close to the experimental value (they were even closer in the past when they were first proposed) but the prize for persistent ingenuity must go to Gary Adamson,34 whose rogues' gallery of l37-ology is shown in Figure 4.5. These examples at least have the virtue of emerging from some attempt at a theory of electromagnetism and particles. But there are also 'pure' numerologists who look for any combinatIOns of powers of small numbers and weighty mathematical constants like 1t which get close to the required 137.035989561. ...

He led one of the two expeditions to measure the tiny bending of light by the Sun's gravity, only measurable during a complete eclipse of the Sun. Einstein's theory predicted that the gravity field of the Sun should deflect passing starlight en route to Earth by about 1.75 seconds of arc as it passed by the Sun's surface. By taking a picture of a distant star field when the Sun's disc was covered by the Earth's shadow and again when the Sun was on the other side of the sky, any tiny shift in the apparent positions of the stars could be detected and the light-bending prediction tested.

His non-combatant position during the First World War led to him being chosen to lead the Principe eclipse expedition. As his career developed he came increasingly into the public eye through a series of impressively lucid popular science books that expounded the developing scientific view of the world, together with his own philosophy of science.

He never marned and lived at the Observatories in Cambridge where his sister kept house for him and their elderly mother.

His cycling record was coded in a single 'Eddington number', E, where E was the number of days in which he had cycled more than E miles. As E starts to get large, a very considerable effort is needed to increase It by even I. At the time of his death Eddington's E number had grown to 87. Eddington held the Plumian Professorship of Experimental PhIlosophy at Cambridge University. This antique title was by tradi- tion that of the semor astronomer in the university. For part of his time in this post Eddington was a contemporary of Paul Dirac, the LucaSlan professor of mathematics and youngest winner of the Nobel prize for physics. DIrac was one of the great physicists of the twenti- eth century, who predicted the existence of antimatter, developed the most transparent presentation of quantum mechanics, uncovered how the electron behaved, and much else besides. His work was of the most fundamental mathematical sort and performed entirely alone. He had no collaborators, only nominal research students, and no research group. It was within this local climate of searches for new laws of Nature and the behaviour of its most elementary particles that Eddington began a programme of work that attracted the entire spectrum of responses, from awed admiration to open ridicule, from his peers. He called it his 'Fundamental Theory' and it was a search for the most basic possible physical theory, one that could explam the numerical values of the constants of Nature. Eddington believed that pure thought could succeed in arriving at a complete description of the physical world. This was an even more ambitious idea 10 hIS day than it IS today.

Eddington believed that by pure thought it should be possible to deduce all the laws and constants of Nature and predict the existence of things like stars and galaxies in the Universe. The image he liked best was that of an astronomer on a cloud-covered planet who deduced the existence of the unseen stars above. Of course, experiments and observations made the task far easier but Eddington believed that was all they did. Without them, his goal would be harder to reach but not unattainable. Eddington's programme was never completed. HIS book was unfln- ished 8 at the time of his death in 1944, but in the years before he had published a number of articles and devoted sections of his popular books to announcing great advances in his programme to understand the values of the constants of Nature. He focused his attention upon a small number of constants of Nature, raising their profile and chal- lengmg scientists to explain them, before embarking upon a complex chain of idiosyncratic mathematical reasoning that was designed to explain their values - exactly.

He proposes that the charactenstics of elementary particles of Nature like the electron should denve locally from the struc- ture of the space and time in which they reside, IO so that there must exist an unknown equation that expresses this relationship in the form: 'radiJM of electron in any direction = numericaL cOMtant X radiJM of curvature of Jpace-time in that direction' Amongst the numbers that Eddmgton regarded as of prime impor- tance was the so called 'Eddington number' which is equal to the number of protons in the visible Universe. II Eddington calculated 12 thiS number to enormous precision (by hand) on a transatlantic boat crossing, concluding with the memorable statement that, 'I believe that there are 15,747,724,136,275,002,577,605, 653,961, 181,555,468,044,717,914,527, 116,709,366,231, 425,076,185,631,031,296 protons in the universe and the same number of electrons.' This huge number, usually denoted by NEeld' is approximately equal to lOBO. What attracted Eddington's attention to it was the fact that It must be a whole number and so it could in principle be calculated extUtly. During the 1920s when Eddington began his quest to explain the constants of Nature there was no good understanding of the weak and strong forces of Nature and the only dimensional constants of physics that were known and interpreted with confidence were those defining gravity and electromagnetic forces. Eddington arranged them into three pure dimensionless numbers. Using the experimental values of the day, he took the ratIO of the masses of the proton and electron ffipJrn. =: 1840,"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"86 The Constants of Nature the inverse of the fine structure constant 21th/ e 2 = 137 and the ratio of the gravitational force to the electromagnetic force between an electron and a proton, To these he added his cosmological number, N Edd = lOBO. These four numbers he called 'the ultimate constants'J3 and explaining their values presented theoretical science with its greatest challenge: 'Are these four constants irreducible, or will a further unifi- cation of physics show that some or all of them can be dispensed with? Could they have been different from what they actually are? ... the question arises whether the above ratios can be assigned arbitrarily or whether they are inevitable. In the former case we can only learn their values by measurement; in the latter case it is possible to find them by theory ... I think the opinion now widely prevails that the [above four] constants ... are not arbitrary but will ultimately be found to have a theoretical explanation; though I have also heard the contrary view expressed.'14 Speculating further, Eddington thought that the number of unexplained constants was a helpful gauge of the gap to be closed before a truly unified theory of all Nature's forces was unveiled. As to whether thiS ultimate theory would contain one constant, or none at all, we would have to wait and see: 'Our present recognition of four constants instead of one merely indicates the amount of unification of theory which"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"E 0 0 I N G TON 5 U NFl N ISH E 0 5 Y MPH 0 N Y 87 still remains to be accomplished.

'15 Eddington hoped that he could create a theory that would weave together the macroscopic world of astronomy and cosmology with the sub-atomic world of protons and electrons. His cosmic numbers were unusual in many respects. First, of course, no one had any idea why they took the particular numerical values that they did. Second, they span a huge size range. The proton-electron mass ratio and the fine structure Constant are not too far away from pure numbers dose to one and they might plausibly turn up as small products of numbers like 2, 3 or 1t in mathematical formulae. This is what Eddington was hoping for. But the other two numbers he selected are completely differ- ent. They are huge. The appearance of a number like 10 40 in a formula in physics needs a very special explanation, or at least a reason that is very different from those that we are used to finding for things in science. Worse still, the vastly bigger number, N Edd <== lOBO, not only suffers an even bigger credibility problem, but it is tantalisingly dose to being the square of the first large number. Surely this can't be a pure coincidence?! Eddington felt that if there was to be one number remain- ing as the defining quantity behind our Universe then that 'arbitrary constant' lay at the root of these huge numbers. 16 Of N Edd , the largest and most mysterious number, he wrote: 'Regarded as the number of particles in the universe, it has generally been looked upon as a special fact [rather than as a necessary truth]. A universe, it is held, could be made with any number of particles; and so far as physics is concerned we must just accept the number allotted to our universe as an accident or as a whim of the Creator.

A universe cannot be made with a different number"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"88 The Constants of Nature of elementary particles consistently with the scheme of defi- nitions by which the \"number of particles\" is assigned to a system in wave mechanics. We must therefore no longer look on it as a special fact about the universe, but as a parameter occurring in the laws of nature and, as such, part of the laws of nature. '17 We shall have a lot more to say about the 'large' numbers because they played an influential role in the development of many cosmolog- ICal theories. Eddington didn't have a theory that could explain them, but he worked very hard on theories which might explain the smaller numbers that lie dose to 137 and 1840. These numbers control almost all the gross features of atoms and atomIC structures. How did Eddington try to explain these numbers? One consistent path of attack for all his calculations was to justify hIs specIal equation 10m 2 - 136m + I = 0 This equation is of a sort that is encountered first in school when you are about IS years old. There are two possible solutIOns of the equa- tion I8 and they are m the ratio of 1847.6 to 1. ThIs was dose enough to the proton-electron mass ratio (which even in Eddington's day was nearer to 1836) to inspire Eddington to find any and every justification for his equatIon and to seek out small adjustments that might explain the small 'discrepancies'. The form of the equation itself he belIeved to be dictated by the number of possible combinations and permutations of numbers and directions that charactensed our four dimensions of space and time. The quantities I, 10 and 136 that appear in the equa- tion are 'derived' from the fact that there are Y + F = 10 simple quan- tities available to describe space and time and then 102 + 6 2 = 136 at the next most complicated level. At first Eddington had seized upon the 136 as likely to be the explanation for the value of the reciprocal of the fine structure constant. But gradually he became persuaded that it was"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"E D DIN G TON 5 U NFl N ISH E D 5 Y MPH 0 N Y 89 necessary to multiply this number by 137/136 (to get 1371) because of a mystenous argument about the need to take into account that the effec- tive electric charges of two particles have an indistmguishable aspect to them. He claims that 'there is nothing mystical about indistinguishabil- ity'I9 but unfortunately almost everyone else thought there was. This sequence of deductions created quite a stir of interest and critiCIsm in sCIentific circles, both for the suspicious 'fudge' factbr that shifted 136 to the more plausible 137 after the fact, and the stubborn experimental fact that unfortunately the fine structure constant did not appear to be an exact whole number at all. Eddington even wrote an article for one of the London newspapers explaining the problems of his esoteric deductIOns. Many other scientists were completely mysti- fied and some, like Vladimir Fock, were moved to poetry about It all: 20 'Though we may weigh it as we will, Exhausted and delirious One-hundred-and-thirly-JelJen still Remains for us mysterious. But Eddington, he, sees it clear, Denouncing those who tend to jeer; It is the number of (says he) The world's dimensions. Can it?! bel!' Eddington's approach to the large numbers was not quite so obscure. It was certainly speculative but at least his colleagues could understand him. He was hoping that the masses of particles like the electron might derIve in some way from the statistical fluctuations of all the masses in the universe. The magnitude of statistical fluctuations 10 collections of N particles is typically given by the square root of N and hence one might be persuaded that the ratio of the electric force to the gravitational force between two protons was a statistical fluctuation determined in magnitude by the square root of N Edd ... 10 80 , which is very nearly 10 40 â¢"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"90 The Constants of Nature THEATRICAL PHYSICS â¢Analogies prove nothing, that is quite true, but they can make one feel more at home.'

The absolute zero of this is characterised by the condition that all degrees of free- dom of the system freeze, that is all internal movements of the lattice cease. An exception to this is, of course, the motion of the electron in its Bohr orbit. According to Eddington each electron possesses 1Ia. degrees of freedom, where a. is the Sommerfeld fine structure constant. Besides electrons, our crystal contains only protons, and the number of degrees of freedom for them is the same since, according to Dirac, a proton can be regarded as a hole in the electron gas. Thus, since one degree of freedom remains because of the orbital motion, in order to attain absolute zero we must remove from a substance 2/a. - 1 degrees of freedom per neutron ( = 1 elec- tron + 1 proton; since our crystal has to be electrically neutral overall). We obtain therefore for the zero temperature To To = - (2/a. - 1) Degrees.

It was intended to characterise a certain class of papers in theoretical physics of recent years which are purely speculative and based on spurious numerical arguments. In a letter received by the editors from these gentlemen they express regret that the formulation they gave this idea was suited to produce misunderstandings.' But the mischievous George Gamow was not one soon to tire of a good joke and shortly afterwards he, Rosenfeld, and Pauli wrote separate letters from different European addresses protesting to the editor that the journal had now published another one of these disgraceful spoof articles and pomted the finger at another semi- numerological article, 'Ongin of Cosmic Penetrating Radiation', by some poor unsuspecting author,22 demanding that the editor obtain its immedi- ate withdrawal from the author in order to maintain the standards of the journal."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"92 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e Here is another lampoon from Max Born's 1944 lectures on Experiment and Theory in Pbysics: 23 'Eddington connects the dimensionless physical constants with the number n of the dimensions of his E spaces and his theory leads to the function f(n) = n 2 (n 2 + 1)/2 which, for consecutive even numbers n = 2, 4, 6, ... assumes the values 10,136,666 ...

After the discussion, Goudsmit went to his friend and mentor Kramers and asked him. \"Do all physicists go off on crazy tangents when they grow old?

He liked to tell hls general readers about his new 'calculations' of the constants of Nature and the overwhelming impression he conveyed was that it might be possible to unlock some of the most deeply hidden secrets of the Umverse by a little bit of inspired guesswork and numerology. If you noticed that some equations had solutions that lay close to numbers like 137 and 1840 then you were in business as a rival to Einstein. No need to observe the world and no need to make any predictions about things that had not yet been seen; the name of the game was linking numbers. I believe that Eddington's work, and his widespread populansa- tlOn of It in books that sold in huge quantities and continued to be read for more than 60 years after they were first published, inspired a generation of amateurs who dreamed of finding the numerological expla- nation for the constants of Nature. Every week I receive letters that contain calculations of a sort that owe much to Eddington's style and approach to Nature. They are characterised by very detailed numerical calculations, a confinement of interest to a small subset of the constants of Nature, and no desire to predict anything new. In order to evaluate the significance of relationships like these, or the ones that we saw proposed in the last chapter to explain the numerical value of the fine structure constant, we need to ask a simple question. What is the chance that seemingly impressive formulae arise purely by chance? If we plck a few suggestive numbers like 2, 3 or 1t and multi- ply them together a few times, how likely are we to get a number that agrees closely with some constant of Nature? Unfortunately for the numerologists, the answer is that these formulae are not very surpris- ing at all. 25 It is easy to be impressed by numerical formulae because it is hard for us to realise how much deliberate searching has gone into the formula on display and how many ways there are to get a close agreement.

Eddington's detailed attempts to explain the values of the constants of Nature have not led to a successful pathway of explana- tion; but they opened up new VIStas and possibilities. They raised the sights of physicists and created a new frontier to strive for. His peren- nial rival James Jeans captured the significance of this unfulfilled quest perfectly when he wrote in 1947 of Eddington's unsuccessful search for a fundamental theory: 'Few if any of Eddington's colleagues accepted his views in their entirety; indeed few if any claimed to understand them. But his general train of thought does not seem unrea- sonable in itself, and it seems likely that some such vast synthesis may in time explain the nature of the world we live in, even though the time may not be yet. '27 Eddington's attempts to produce a unified explanatIOn for the constants of Nature attracted few adherents. The great physicists of his day, like Dirac, Einstein, Bohr and Born, found it useless and politely confessed that they couldn't understand it.

Paul Dirac was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge for some of the time when Eddmgton was living at the Observatories. Stories of Dirac's simple and entirely logical approach to life and social interaction are legion and it is entirely in keeping with their peculiar tenor to find that his unexpected foray into the issue of Large Numbers was written whilst on his honeymoon, in February 1937. 7 Unpersuaded by Eddington's numerological approach to the pres- ence of 'large numbers' amongst the constants of Nature,8 Dirac argued that very large dimensiOnless numbers taking values like 10 40 and IO BO are most unlikely to be independent and unrelated aCCidents: there must exist some undiscovered mathematical formula linking the quantities"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"100 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f N a I u r e involved.

By this, he meant that there must be laws of Nature that require formulae like N I = N z or even N I = 2N z â¢ A number like 2, or 3, not terribly different from I is permitted because it is so much smaller than the large numbers involved in the formula; this is what he meant by the 'coefficients ... of the order of unity: This hypothesIs of equality between Large Numbers is not in itself original to Dirac.

There is thus a possibility that the ancient dream of philosophers to connect all Nature with the properties of whole numbers will some day be realised.'13 Dirac's approach has two significant elements. First, he seeks to show that what might previously have been regarded as coincidences are consequences of a deeper set of relationships that have been missed. Second, he sacrifices the constancy of the oldest known constant of Nature. Unfortunately, Dirac's hypothesis did not survive for long. The proposed change in the value of G was just too dramatic. In the past gravity would have been much stronger; the energy output of the Sun would be changed and the Earth would have been far hotter in the past than usually assumed. 14 In fact, as the American physicist Edward Teller showed l5 in 1948, the oceans would have been boiling in the pre-Cambrian era, 200-300 million years ago, and life as we know it would not have survived, yet geological evidence available then showed that life had existed on Earth for at least 500 million years. Teller, an Hungarian emigre, was a high-profile physicist who played an important role in the development of the hydrogen bomb. He and Stan Ulam at Los Alamos were the two individuals who came up with the key idea (discovered independently by Andrei Sakharov in the Soviet Union) that showed how a nuclear bomb could be detonated.

The Sun would not be shining today if e 2 grows in proportion to the age of the universe. It would have been too small in the past to allow stars like the Sun to form. Gamow had a number of discussions with Dirac about these vari- ants to hiS hypothesIs of varymg G. Dirac made an interesting response to Gamow with regard to his Idea that the charge on the electron, and hence the fine structure constant, might be varymg. No doubt recall- ing Eddington's early belief that the fine structure constant was a rational number, he writes to Gamow m 1961 about the cosmological conse- quences of Its vanation as the logarithm of the age of the Universe, that 'It is difficult to make any firm theories about the early stages of the universe because we do not know whether bc/e 2 is a constant or varies proportional to Iog(t). If bc/e2 were an integer it would have to be a constant, but the experimenters now say it is not an integer, so it might very well be varying. If it does vary, the chemistry of the early stages would be quite different, and radio-activity would also be affected.

His most important scientific work had involved understanding the strucrure of atoms and the behaviour of the electron. All this was based upon the assumption, shared by everyone else, that e was a true constant, the same at all times and in all places in the Universe. Even Gamow soon gave up his theory about varying e and concluded that 'The value of e stands as the Rock of Gibraltar for the last 6 X 10 9 years!,I8 Dirac's suggestion attracted wide interest from scientists of many unexpected quarters. Alan Turing, a pioneer in cryptography and the theory of computation, was fascinated by the idea of changing grav- Ity and speculated about whether it would be possible to test the idea from fossil evidence, asking if 'a paleontologist could tell from the footprint of an extinct animal, whether its weight was what it was supposed to be.

Haldane 20 became fascinated by the possible biological consequences of cosmological theorIes in which traditional 'constants' change WIth time or where gravitational processes unfolded with respect to a different cosmic clock than atomic processes. Such two-timing universes had been proposed by Milne and were the first suggestions that G might not be constant. Processes, like radioactive decay or molecular interaction rates, might be constant on one timescale but significantly variable with respect to the other.

This imaginative scenario is not dissimilar to that now known as 'punctuated equilibrium' m which evolution occurs in a staccato succes- Sion of accelerated bouts interspersed by long periods of slow change. However, Haldane provides an explanation for the changes. What all these diverse responses to the ideas of Eddington and Dirac have in common is a growing appreciation that constants of Nature play a vital cosmological role: that there is a link between the structure of the Universe as a whole and the local conditions within it that are necessary for life to evolve and persist.

William Shakespeare, Troi/us and Cressida The short-term legacy of the early mterest in large numbers involving the constants of Nature was a focus of interest upon the possibility that some tradiuonal constants of Nature might be varying very slowly over the billions of years of cosmic history. New theories of gravity were developed, extending Einstein's general theory of relativity to include varying gravity. Instead of being treated as a constant, Newton's G was like temperature, able to vary in strength from place to place and with the passage of time.

Many sCIentists found parts of this theory but the simplest and most complete representation of it was written down by the American physicist Robert Dicke and his research student, Carl Brans, in 196I. Dicke was a rare physicist. He was equally at home as a mathe- matician, an experimental physicist, a distiller of complicated astro- nomical data, or the designer of sophisticated measuring instruments. He had the widest possible scientific interests. He realised that the idea of a varying 'constant' of gravity could be subjected to a plethora of observational tests, using the data of geology, palaeontology, astron- omy and laboratory physics. Nor was he motivated simply by a desire to explain the Large Numbers. During the mid 1960s there was a further motivation for developing an extension of Einstein's theory of gravity that included varying G. For a while it appeared that Einstein's predictions about the wobble in the orbit of the planet Mercury did not agree with observations when the slightly non-spherical shape of the Sun was taken into account. Dicke showed that if a variation in G with time was allowed then its rate of change could be chosen to have a value that would agree with the observations of Mercury's orbit. Sadly, years later this was all found to be something of a wild goose chase. The disagree- ment with Einstein's theory was being created by inaccuracies in our attempts to measure the diameter of the Sun which made it seem that the Sun was a different shape than it really was. The Sun's size is not so easy to measure at the levels of accuracy required because of the turbulent activity on the solar surface. When thIs problem was resolved in 1977 the need for a varying G to reconcl1e the observa- tions with theory disappeared. 21 In 1957, whilst beginning to develop theories with varying G, Dicke prepared a major review about the geophysical, palaeontological and astronomical evidences for possible variations of the traditional physical constants.

This is the number of particles in the Universe. The age of the Universe \"now\" is not random but is conditioned by biologi- cal factors . . . [because changes in the values of Large Numbers] would preclude the existence of man to consider the problem.' Four years later, he elaborated thiS important insight in more detail, with special reference to Dirac's Large Number cOincidences, in a short letter published in the journal Nature. Dicke argued that biochem- icallife-forrns like ourselves owe their chemical basis to such elements as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus which are synthesised after billions of years of main-sequence stellar evolution. (The argument applies with equal force to any life-form based upon any atomic elements heavier than helium.) When stars die these 'heavy' bIOlogical elements are dispersed throughout space by supernovae from whence they are incorporated into grains, planetesimals, planets, self-replicating 'smart' molecules like DNA and, ultimately, into ourselves.

All Dlrac's cOincldence is saying is that we live at a time in cosmic history after the stars have formed and before they die. This is not surprising. Dicke is telling us that we could not fail to observe Dlrac's coincidence: it is a prerequi- site for life of our sort to exist. There is no need to give up Einsteln's theory of gravitation by requmng G to vary, as Dlrac implicitly reqUired, nor do we need to deduce some numerologlcal connection between the strength of gravity and the number of partlcles in the universe as Eddington had thought.

I prefer the one that allows the possibility of endless life.'

However, 1f gravity is getting weaker it is not dear that stars and planets would be able to exist in the far future. At the very least, other constants would need to vary to main- tain the balance between gravity and the other forces of Nature that make their existence possible. It is very striking that other notable cosmologists like Milne had previously argued in the opposite way to Dicke. Milne regarded the appearance of Large Number coincidences in Eddington's theories as suspicious. He didn't believe that any 'Fundamental Theory' of Nature could possibly hope to explain coincidences between large numbers precisely because the large numbers involved the present age of the Universe. Since there was nothing special about the present time we were living at, no fundamental theory of physics could predict it or p1ck it out and so it could not explain the cOincidences: 'There is necessarily an empirically defined quantity, t [the present age of the universe] occurring in these expressions, for this simply measures the position of the instant at which we happen to be viewing the universe. This, of course, is incapable of prediction . . . The circumstance that Eddington's theory of the constants of nature appears to predict this ... on a priori grounds seems to me an argu- ment against Eddington's theory ... for it appears to be equivalent to the feat of predicting the age of the universe at the moment we happen to be viewing it; which would be absurd.

This means that the observ- able Universe must be at least ten billion years old and so, since it is expanding, it must be at least ten billion light years in size. We could not exist in a universe that was significantly smaller. Despite Dirac's dislike of Dicke's approach, we can find an unusual application of a similar idea being introduced by him to save his theory that G falls as the universe ages. After Edward Teller and others had discovered the problems that such a radical variation of gravity would create for the history of stars and life on Earth, there were attempts to keep the varying-G theory alive by assuming that stars like the Sun periodically passed through dense clouds from which they accreted material fast enough to offset the effects of decreasing G on the Sun's gravitational pull. Gamow thought that such an assumption 'would be extremely unelegant, so that the total amount of elegance in the entire theory would have decreased quite considerably even though the elegant assumption [G oc t- I ] would be saved. So, we are thrown back to the hypothe- sis that 10 40 is simply the largest number the almighty God could write during the first day of creation.' It is interesting to note Gamow's stress on the 'inelegance' of fudging the theory in this way, since Dirac always urged others to look for 'beauty' (which is not necessanly the same thing as simpliclty, he liked to point out) in the equations describing a physical theory. Indeed, he once wrote to Heisenberg about one of his proposed theories that 'My main objection to your work is that I do not think your basic ... equation has sufficient mathematical beauty to be a fundamental equation of physics. The correct"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"THE MYSTERY OF THE VERY LARGE NUMBERS 111 equation, when it is discovered. will probably involve some new kind of mathematics and will excite great interest among pure mathematicians.'25 Yet Dirac was happy to defend the accretion Idea. no matter how improbable it might appear, on the ground that it might be necessary for life to exist: 'I do not see your objection to the accretion hypothesis. We may assume that the sun has passed through some dense clouds. sufficiently dense for it to pick up enough matter to keep the earth at a habitable temperature for 10 9 years. You may say that it is improbable that the density should be just right for this purpose. I agree. It iJ improb- able. But this kind of improbability does not matter. If we consider all the stars that have planets, only a very small fraction of them will have passed through clouds of the right density to maintain their planets at an equable temper- ature long enough for advanced life to develop. There will not be so many planets with men on them as we previously thought. However, provided there is one, it is sufficient to fit the facts. So there is no objection to assuming our sun has had a very unusual and improbable history.'26 This is a remarkable about-face, six years after his mitlal opposition to Dicke's inclusion of human life as a factor 10 assessing the likeli- hood of unusual situations arising. A beautifully simple argument regarding the inevitability of the large size of the Universe for us appears first 10 the text of the Bampton Lectures given by the Oxford theologian Eric Mascall.

It is sobering to reflect upon all the metaphysical and religious responses there have been, over the centuries, to the darkness of the night sky and the patterns of stars embroidered upon it; to the vast- ness of space and our incidental place within it, a mere dot in the grand scheme of things. Modern cosmology shows that these features are not random accidents. They are part and parcel of the whole inter- connectedness of the universe. They are, in fact, necessary features of any universe that contains hving observers. Remarkably, the metaphys- ical effect of this type of universe upon 1ts mhab1tants may well be another inescapable by-product for any sentient beings elsewhere as well. The Universe has the curious property of making living beings think that its unusual properties are unsympathetic to the existence of life when in fact they are essential for it. If we were to smooth out all the material in the Universe into a uniform sea of atoms we would see just how little of anything there is. There would be little more than about I atom in every cubic metre of space. No laboratory on Earth could produce an artificial vacuum that was anywhere near as empty as that.

If you want really huge numbers you need to find a place where the possibilities multiply rather than add. For this you need complexity. And for complexity you need biology.

Large as this number might appear to be (you would not live long enough to count up to It!) It would now be seen as a staggering underestimate.

These connections play some role in creating our thoughts and memories. How this is done is still one of Nature's closely guarded secrets. Mike Holderness suggests that one way of estimating 32 the number of POSSI- ble thoughts that a brain could conceive is to count all those connec- tIOns. The bram can do many things at once so we could view it as some number, say a thousand, little groups of neurons.

If the 1000 or so groups of neurons can operate independently of each other then each of them contributes 1070000.000000 possible wirings, increasing the total to the Holderness number, 1070.000.000.000000.

Douglas Adams l Why isn't our Universe much older than it appears to be? It is easy to understand why the Universe isn't much younger. Stars take a long time to form and to produce the heavier elements that biolog1cal complex- ity requires. But old Universes have their problems as well. As time passes in the Universe the process of star formation w1ll slow down. All the gas and dust that forms the raw material for stars w1ll have been processed by stars and ejected into intergalactic space where it is unable to cool down and coalesce into new stars. Few stars means few solar systems and planets. Any planets that do form are less actlve than those formed earlier. The production of radlOact1ve elements in the stars will diminish and those that are formed will have longer half- lives. New planets will be less geologically active and will lack many of the subterranean movements that power vulcanism, continental dnft and mountain uplifting on the Earth. If this also makes the presence of a magnetic field less likely on a planet then life will be very unhkely to evolve into complex forms. Typical stars, like our Sun, emit a wind of electrically-charged particles from their surface which will strip off the atmospheres of orbiting planets unless the wind can be deflected by a planetary magnetic field. In our solar system the Earth's magnetic field has protected its atmosphere from the solar wind but Mars, unpro- tected by any magnetic field, lost its atmosphere long ago. Long life on a solar system planet 1S probably not easy to sus tam. We have gradually come to appreciate how precarious it is.

There is something unusual about this. Suppose the typical time that it takes for life to evolve IS called t(bio), then from the evidence of our solar system, which IS about 4.6 billion years old, it seems that the time it takes for stars to settle down and create a stable source of heat and light, t(star), IS"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"B I 0 LOG Y AND THE 5 TAR 5 125 not very different to t(bio) because we have found simple forms of terrestrial bacterial life that are several billion years old. ThiS slmllanty between t(bio) and t(star) seems like a coincidence. At first sight we might assume that the microscopic biochemical processes and local environmental conditions that combme to deter- mine the magnitude of t(bio) are independent of the nuclear astrophysi- cal and gravitational processes that determme the typical stellar lifetime of a star. However, this assumption leads to the stnkmg conclUSIon that we should expect extraterrestrial forms of life to be exceptionally rare. The argument, m its simplest form, introduced by Brandon Carter and developed further by myself and Frank Tipler,6 and still investi- gated minutely today? goes like this. If t(bio) and t(star) are unconnected with one another then the time that life takes to arise will be random With respect to the stellar time scale t(star). So It is most likel y 8 that we should either find that t(bio) IS much bigger than t(star) or find that t(bio) is much less than t(star). Now let's take stock. On the one hand, if t(bio) is typically much less than t(star) we need to ask why it is that the first observed inhab- Ited solar system (ours!) has t(bio) approximately equal to t( star). By our logic, thiS would be extraordinarily unlikely. On the other hand, if t(bio) IS typically much greater than t(star) then the first observed mhablted solar system (ours) is a statistical fluke and most likely to have t(bio) approximately equal to t(star), since systems WIth t(bio) much greater than t(star) have yet to evolve. Thus we are led to conclude that we are a ranty, one of the first livmg systems to arrive on the scene. In order to escape from thiS conclusion we have to undermine one of the assumptions underlying the argument that leads to It. For example, if we suppose that t(bio) is not independent of t(star), then things look different. If the ratIO t(bio)/ t(star) increases with t(star) then it may become likely that we will find t(bio) approximately equal to t(star).

The length of this phase might be expected to be mversely proportlOnal to the intensity of radiation in the wavelength interval 1000-2000 Angstroms, where the key molec- ular levels for water absorption lie. Further studies of stellar evolution may allow us to determine the length of this phase and so establish a link between the biological evolut10n time and the main-sequence stellar lifetime. This model indicates a possible route to establishing a link between the biochemical time scales for the evolution of life and the astro- physical time scales that determme the time required to create an envi- ronment supported by a stable hydrogen-burning star. There are obvious weak links in the argument, though. It provides only a necessary con- dition for life to evolve, not a suffic1ent one. We could imagine an expression for the probability of planet formation around a star. It would involve many other factors which would determine the amount of material available for the formation of solid planets with atmos- pheres at distances wh1ch permit the presence of liquid water and stable surface conditions. Furthermore, we know that there were many 'acci- dents' of the planetary formation process in the solar system which have subsequently played a major role m the existence of long-hved stable conditions on Earth. For example, as Jacques Laskar and his co- workers IO have shown, the presence of resonances between the preces- sion rates of rotating planets and the gravitat10nal perturbations they feel from all other bod1es in their solar system can easily produce chaotic evolution of the tilt of a planet's rotation axis with respect to the orbital plane of the planets over times much shorter than the age of the solar system. The planet's surface temperature variat10ns and sea levels are senSitive to this angle of tllt. It determmes the climatic d1ffer- ences between what we call 'the seasons'. In the case of the Earth, the modest angle of tilt (approx1mately 23 degrees) would have expen- enced thiS erratic evolution had it not been for the presence of the"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"B I 0 LOG Y AN 0 THE 5 TAR 5 127 Moon. The Moon is so large that its gravitational effects dominate the resonances which exist between the Earth's precessional rotation and the frequency of external grav1tatiOnal perturbations from the other planets. As a result the Earth's tilt wobbles only by half a degree around 23 degrees over hundreds of thousands of years. This shows how the causal link between stellar lifetimes and biological evolution times may be rather a minor factor in the chain of fortuitous circumstances that must occur if habitable planets are to form and sustain viable condit1ons for the evolution of hfe over long pen ods of time. OTHER TYPES OF LIFE 'Life is not for everyone.' Michael 0 Donoghue\" One of the assumptions that arguments for the inevitability of a large and cool universe are 1mphCltly makmg 1S that all life is very much like us. Biologists seem happy to admit the possibility of other forms of life but are not so sure that it is likely to evolve spontaneously, without a helping hand from carbon-based life-forms. Most estimates of the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligences existing in the Universe focus upon life-forms similar to ourselves who live on plan- ets and need water, gaseous atmospheres and so forth. It is worth stretching our imagmations a little to think about what life might be like 1f 1t was space-based rather than planet-based. The astronomer Fred Hoyle created an interesting example which he hoped would evade the usual unfavourable conclusions about likelihood that had been made for planet-based ETIs.

There was much discus- sion about the likelihood of life elsewhere and the first two Soviet Sputnik space probes were launched in 1957. The scenario is set for Earth to face the approach from space of a cloud of gas, of which there are many in interstellar space, which is on course to pass between the Earth and the Sun. If it does then the heat and light from the Sun will be cut off for a period, after being amplified for a while by reflection from the cloud, with potentially calamitous consequences for Earth. Events take an unexpected turn. The cloud turns out to be intelligent, an amorphous life-form existing as a huge system of complex molecular correlations moving through space. After much intrigue and excitement the Earth survives its brief encounter WIth the passing cloud but not before it has established a dialogue with It and learned to decode the signals it uses to speak to us. Yet the most important message that Hoyle was trying to get across in this story was the possIble error of assuming that life lives on solid planets. Perhaps the chemical complexity needed to qualify as 'life' could exist in huge molecular clouds, stabilised by the binding force of gravity. Even carbon might not be needed 10 these nebulous cradles of life. Thirty years later Hoyle was to return to this theme in his scientific work and science fiction, imagining that self-reproducing molecules could have evolved within cometary interiors and then spread around the galaxies by the motion of the comets. Other science fiction writers had explored the possibilities of alter- natives to carbon chemIstry.

But such artificial forms of life and intelligence are not spontaneously evolved. They have required the help of carbon- based organisms to bring together the highly organised, and hence extremely improbable, configurations needed for their persistence and development. These more abstract alternatives to life in flesh and blood form are now rather familtar to us and SCience fiction writers have to be considerably more subtle than merely to imagine aliens with odd chemistries and new bodily forms. But back in 1957 Hoyle's idea was a novel one. It played an important role in widening the spectrum of possibilities for life beyond what most astronomers had in mind. The probability of life was not to be determined solely from the statistics of habitable planets with temperate atmospheres and surface water in orbit around friendly stars.

Brooke Shields\" There is one further curiosity about the coincidence that exists between the biOlogical evolution time and astronomy. Since it is unsurprising that the ages of typical stars are similar to the present age of the Universe there is also an apparent coincidence between the age of the Universe and the time it has taken to evolve life-forms like ourselves. If we look back at how long our intelligent ancestors (Homo sapiens) have been on the scene we find that it is only about 200,000 years, which is much less than the age of the Universe, I3 billion years.

Suppose they were still thinking about these questions when the Universe was one thousand billion years old. Then they would calculate that their intelligent ancestors had been around for 1000 billion minus 13 billion plus 200,000 years. The answer 987.2 billion years is very similar to 1000 billion years. Our descendants would not think that the history of their civilisation lasted for just a tiny fraction of the history of the universe. Brandon Carter and Richard Gott have argued that this appears to make us rather special compared with observers in the far distant future. If you believe that our location in cosmic history should not be special in this way then you are led to a dramatic conclusion. In order to make sure that we and our descendants in the near future do not have a special view of cosmic history, thinking our own history IS vastly less than the total history of the Umverse, we need to have no far future descendants. If life on Earth disappeared in a few thousand years then all our descendants would observe roughly the same number for the fraction of cosmic history that has seen human civil- Isation exist. Gott estimated that by this argument we should be 95 per cent confident that life on Earth will end between 5000 and 7.8 million years in the future. There is no reason to confine this argument to such cataclysmic events as the extinction of human life. It is based upon the simple statistical fact that if you observe something at a random time there is a 95 per cent chance that you will be observing it during the middle 95 per cent of the period when It can be observed. 14 To show the versa- tility of this simple piece of statistics, Gott was asked to prepare a series of predictions for the January 1st, 2000 Issue of the Wall Street JournaL The ones chosen are shown in Figure 7.3.

For many years it had been claimed that the average achievement by pupils in some South-East Asian countries was Signif- Icantly higher than 10 the Umted K1Ogdom. Then it came to light that the weakest pupils in that country were removed from the total who were evaluated at an earlier stage in the educational process. Clearly, the effect of their removal IS to skew the average attainments to be higher than they would otherwise be. Another recent example that caught my eye was an American survey to discover if people who attended church also tended to have better health. A serious bias beset the final results because people who were extremely Sick would be unable to attend church. What these examples show is that scientists of all sorts must strive to be aware of any bias that might skew their data to produce a conclUSion that is not present in the underlying evidence.

This also precipitated a broad change of outlook. Suddenly, subjects like biol- ogy and geology which had traditionally had very little to do with astronomy and cosmology, were seen to be of cosmic importance. A broadened perspective to cosmological thinking appeared. Some cosmo- logical theories might be tested by geophysical or palaeontological evidence or lead to histories 10 which the evolution of life by natural selectiOn could not have occurred. Astronomers became used to asking how finely balanced a situation eXisted in the Umverse with respect to the existence of life hke us or life of any other conceivable sort. The observed values of many of the fundamental constants of Nature or of the quantities describing the properties of the Universe's global properties - its shape, itS speed of expansion, its uniformity - also seemed quite delicately poised. Quite small shifts in the status quo would render all conceivable complexity impossible. Habitable universes came to be seen as rather a tricky balancing act to accomplish.

Wallace was a great scientist who today receives little of the credit he deserves. It was he, rather than Charles Darwin, who first had the idea that livlOg orgamsms evolve by a process of natural selection. Fortunately for Darwin, who had been thlOklOg deeply and gathering evidence to support such an idea independently of Wallace over a very long period of time, Wallace wrote to him to tell him of his ideas rather than simply publishing them in the sCientific literature. Yet today, 'evolutionary biol- ogy' focuses almost entirely upon the contributions of Darwin. Wallace was far broader in his interests than DarwlO and was interested in most areas of physics, astronomy and earth sciences. In 1903 he published a Wide-ranging study of the factors that make the Earth a habitable place and went on to explore the philosophical conclu- sions that might be drawn from the state of the Universe. His book went under the resonant title Man's Place in the Universe. 18 This was before the discovery of the theories of relativity, nuclear energy and the expand- 109 umverse. 19 Most nineteenth-century astronomers conceived of the Umverse as a single island of matter, what we would now call our Milky Way galaxy. It was not established that there existed other galax- ies or what the overall scale of the Universe was. It was only clear that it was big. Wallace was impressed by the simple cosmological model that Lord KelvlO had developed using Newton's law of gravitation. It showed that if we took a very large ball of matenal then the action of gravity would cause it all to collapse towards its centre. The only way to avoid gettlOg pulled into the centre was to orbit around the centre. Kelvin's universe contained about one billion stars like the Sun in order that their gravi- tational forces would counterbalance motions at the observed speeds. 20 What is lOtnguing about Wallace's discussion 21 of this model of the Universe is that he adopts a non-Copernican attitude because he sees how some places in the Umverse are more conducive to the pres- ence of life than others. As a result, it is only to be expected that we he near, but not at, the centre of things."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"136 The Con 5 I a n I 5 0 f Na I u r e Remarkably, Wallace produces an analogue of Dicke's argument for the great age of any universe observed by humans. Of course, in Wallace's time, long before the discovery of nuclear power sources, no one knew how the Sun was powered. Kelvin had argued for gravita- tional energy, but it was not adequate for the job. In Kelvin's cosmol- ogy, material would be attracted by gravity into the central regions where the Milky Way was situated and fall into the stars that were already there, generating heat and maintaining their luminous power output over huge periods of time. Here, Wallace sees a simple reason for the vast size of the Universe: 'Here then, I think, we have found an adequate explanation of the very long-continued light- and heat-emitting capac- ity of our sun, and probably of many others in about the same position in the solar cluster. These would at first grad- ually aggregate into considerable masses from the slowly moving diffuse matter of the central portions of the origi- nal universe; but at a later period they would be reinforced by a constant and steady inrush of matter from its outer regions possessing such high velocities as to aid in produc- ing and maintaining the requisite temperature of a sun such as ours, during the long periods demanded for continuous life-development. The enormous extension and mass of the original universe of diffused matter (as postulated by Lord Kelvin) is thus seen to be of the greatest importance as regards this ultimate product of evolution, because with- out it, the comparatively slow-moving and cool central regions might not have been able to produce and maintain the requisite energy in the form of heat; while the aggre- gation of by far the larger portion of its matter in the great revolving ring of the galaxy was equally important, in order to prevent the too great and too rapid inflow of matter to those favoured regions ....

'22 Wallace sees clearly the connection between these unusual global features of the Universe and the conditions necessary for life to evolve and prosper: 'we can dimly see the bearing of all the great features of the stellar universe upon the successful development of life. These are, its vast dimensions: the form it has acquired in the mighty ring of the Milky Way: and our position near to, but not exactly in, its centre. '23 He also expects that this process of infall and solar power generation from gravitational energy will probably have a staccato form with long periods of infall driving heating of the stars followed by periods of qUiescence and cooling, a period which we have just begun to experience: 'I have here suggested a mode of development which would lead to a very slow but continuous growth of the more central suns: to an excessively long period of nearly station- ary heat-giving power; and lastly, an equally long period of very gradual cooling - a period the commencement of which our sun may have just entered upon. 24 Wallace completes his discussion of the cosmic conditions needed for the evolution of life by turning his attention to the geology and history of the Earth. Here he sees a far more complicated situation than eXists in astronomy.

The large size of the observable Universe, with its lOBO atoms, allows a vast number of sites for the statistical variatlons of chemical combination to be worked through. Yet, despite his interest in the huge Slze of the Umverse in makmg it probable that we evolved, Wallace was averse to the idea of a Universe populated with many other living beings. He believed that the unifor- mity of the laws of physics and chemistrf6 would ensure that 'organised living beings wherever they may exist in the universe must be fundamentally, and in essential nature, the same also. The outward forms of life, if they exist else- where, may vary, almost infinitely, as they do vary on earth ...

There are three types of change to consider. Tiny, infinitesimal, changes are possible. If we change the value of the fine structure constant only in the twentieth deCimal place there will be no bad consequences for life that we know of. If we change it by a very small amount, say in the second decimal place, then the changes become more significant. Properties of atoms are altered and complicated processes like protein folding or DNA replication may be adversely affected. However, new possibilities for chemical complexity may open up. Evaluating the conse- quences of these changes is difficult because they are not so cut and dried. Third, there are very large changes. These will stop atoms or nuclei existing at all and are much more clear-cut as a barrier to developing complexity based upon the forces of Nature. For many conceivable changes, there could be no imaginable forms of life at all. First, it is important to be qUite clear about the way in which Dicke introduced his anthropic argument since there is considerable confusion 2 amongst commentators. A condition, like the existence of stars or certain chemical elements, is Identified as a necessary condition for the existence of any form of chemical complexity, of which life is the most impres- sive known example. This does not mean that if this condition is met that life must exist, will never die out if It does exist, or that the fact that this condition holds in our Universe means that it was 'designed' with life in mind. These are all quite separate matters. If our 'necessary' anthropic condition is truly a necessary condition for hving observers to exist in the Universe then it is a feature of the Universe that we must find it to possess, no matter how unlikely it might appear a pnon. The error that many people now make IS to assume that an anthropic argument of this sort is a new scientific theory about the Universe that is a rival for other more conventional forms of explana- tIOn as to why the Universe possesses the 'necessary' anthropic condi- tion.

As we have seen, the story of Dirac and Dicke is a case m point. Dirac did not realise that a Large Number coincidence was a necessary consequence of being an observer who looks at the Universe at a time roughly equal to time required for stars to make the chemi- cal elements needed for complex hfe to evolve spontaneously. As a result he drew the wrong conclusion that huge changes needed to be made to the laws of physics - changmg the law of gravity to allow G to vary in time. Dicke showed that although such a coincidence might appear unlikely a priori, it was m fact a necessary feature of a universe contain- ing observers like ourselves. It is therefore no more (and no less) surpris- ing a feature of the Universe than our own existence. There are many interesting examples of observer bias in less cosmic situations than the one considered by Dicke. My favourite concerns our perceptions of traffic flow. A recent survey of Canadian drivers 3 showed that they tended to think that the next lane on the highway moves faster than the one they are travelling in. This inspired the authors of the study to propose many complex psychological reasons for this belief amongst drivers, thinking perhaps that a driver is more likely to make compar- isons With other traffic when being passed by faster cars than when over- taking them or that being overtaken leaves a bigger impression on a driver than overtaking. These conclusions are by no means unimportant because one of the conclusions of the study was that drivers rrught be educated about these tendencies so as to help them resist the constant urge to change lanes in search of a faster path, thereby speeding total traffic flow and improving safety. However, while the psychological causes might well be present, there is a sImpler explanation for the results of the survey: trqffic does go faster in the other lanes! The reason is a form of observer selec- tion. Typically, slower lanes are created by overcrowding. 4 So, on the aver- age, there are more cars in congested lanes moving slowly than there are in emptier lanes moving faster. s If you select a driver at random and ask them if they thmk the next lane is faster you are more likely to pick a driver in a congested lane because that's where most drivers are.

Observers could not have been there to witness it. These observations have other by-products of a much more philo- sophical nature.

It could have stopped them pursuing another incorrect cosmological possi- bility for nearly twenty years. In I948 Hermann Bond1, Thomas Gold and Fred Hoyle introduced a rival to the expanding Big Bang Umverse. The Big Bang theorylO implied that the expansion of the Universe began at a definite past time. Subsequently, the density and temperature of the matter and radiation in the Universe fell steadily as the Umverse expanded. This expansion may continue forever or it may one day reverse into a state of contraction, revisiting conditions of ever greater density and temperature until a Big Crunch is encountered at a finite time in our future (see Figure 8.3). This evolving scenario has the key feature that the physical condi- tions in the Universe's past were not the same as those that exist today or wh1ch w1ll exist in the future.

In the steady state theory there is no beginOlng and the expansion rate is just the expansion rate and nothing more. This is illustrated in the picture shown in Figure 8.4. In a Big Bang theory the fact that the expansion age is just slightly greater than the age of the stars is a natural state of affairs.

But in a steady state universe the 'age' is infiOlte and is not linked to the rate of expansion. In a steady state Universe it is therefore a complete coincidence that the inverse of the expansion rate gives a time that is roughly equal to the time required for stars to produce elements hke carbon.

Mark Twain We have seen that a good deal of time is needed if stars are to manu- facture carbon out of inert gases hke hydrogen and helium. But time is not enough. The specific nuclear reaction that is needed to make carbon is a rather improbable one. It requires three nuclei of helium to come together to fuse into a s10gle nucleus of carbon. Helium nuclei are called alpha particles and thiS key carbon-formmg reaction has been dubbed the 'tnple-alpha' process. The American physicist Ed Salpeter first recognised its significance 10 1952. However, a few months later, whilst visiting Cal Tech in Pasadena, Fred Hoyle realised that making carbon 10 stars by this process was doubly difficult. First, it was diffi- cult to get three alpha particles to meet and, even if you did, the frUltS of their liaison might be short-hved. For if you looked a little further down the chain of nuclear reactions it seemed that all the carbon could quickly get consumed by interacting with another alpha particle to create oxygen. Hoyle realised that the only way to explam why there was a signif- icant amount of carbon in the universe was if the production of carbon went much faster and more effiCiently than had been envisaged, so that the ensuing burning to oxygen did not have time to destroy it all. There was only one way to achieve this carbon boost. Nuclear reactions occa- sionally experience special situations where their rates are dramatically increased. They are said to be 'resonant' if the sum of the energies of the 1Ocom1Og reacting particles is very close to a natural energy level of a new heaVier nucleus. When thiS happens the nuclear reaction goes especially quickly, often by a huge factor.

Only if that was the case could the cosmic carbon abundance be explained, Hoyle reasoned. Unfortunately no energy level was known in the carbon nucleus at the required place. I2 Pasadena was a good place to think about the energy levels of nuclei. Willy Fowler led a team of outstanding nuclear physicists and was an extremely affable and enthusiastic individual. Hoyle didn't hesi- tate to pay him a visit. And soon Fowler had persuaded himself that all the past experiments could indeed have missed the energy level that Hoyle was proposmg. Within days, Fowler had pulled in other nuclear physicists from the Kellogg Radiation Lab and an experiment was planned. The result when it came was dramatic. I3 There was a new energy level in the carbon nucleus at 7.656 Me'l, just where Hoyle had predicted it would be. The whole sequence of events for the production of carbon by stars then looked so delicately balanced that, as a science-fiction universe, It would have seemed contrived. First, three helium nuclei (alpha particles) have to interact at one place. This they manage to do in a two-step process. First, two helium nuclei combine to create a beryllium nucleus helium + helium ~ beryllium Fortunately, beryllium has a peculiarly long lifetime,I2 ten thousand times longer than the time required for two helium nuclei to interact and so it stays around long enough to have a good chance of combin- ing with another helium nucleus to produce a carbon nucleus: beryllium + helium ~ carbon The 7.656 Me V energy level in the carbon nucleus lies just above the energies of the beryllium plus helium (7.3667 MeV), so that when the thermal energy of the inside of the star is added the nuclear"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"154 The Constants of Nature reaction becomes resonant and lots of carbon is produced. But that 1S not the end of the story. The next reaction waiting to burn up all the carbon is carbon + helium ~ oxygen. What if this reaction should turn out to be resonant as well? Then all the rapidly produced carbon would disappear and the carbon resonance level would be to no avail. Remarkably, this last reaction just fails to be resonant. The oxygen nucleus has an energy level at 7.ll87 MeV that lies just below the total energy of carbon plus helium at 7.I 6 I 6 Me V So when the extra thermal energy in the star is added this reac- tion can never be resonant and the carbon survives (see Figure 8.7). Hoyle recognised that his finely balanced sequence of apparent co- incidences was what made carbon-based life a possibility in the Universe. ls The positioning of the nuclear energy levels in carbon and oxygen is the result of a very complicated interaction between nuclear and elec- tromagnetic forces that could not be calculated easily when the discov- ery of the carbon resonance level was first made. Today, it is possible to make very good estimates of the contributions of electromagnetic and nuclear forces to the levels concerned. One can see that their posi- tions are a consequence of the fine structure constant and strong nuclear force constant taking the values that they do with high precision. If the fine structure constant, that governs the strength of electromag- netic forces, were changed by more than 4 per cent or the strong force by more than 0.4 of one per cent then the production of carbon or oxygen would be reduced by factors of between 30 and IOOO. More detailed calculations of the fate of stars when these constants of Nature are slightly changed have been carried out recently by Heinz Oberhummer, Attila Csoto and Helmut 5chlattl. 16 Their results can be seen in Figure 8.6.

Are these numbers immutable, like the atoms of the nineteenth-century physicist? Could there be a consistent physics with different values for the numbers?' Hoyle sees two alternatives on offer: either we must seek to demon- strate that the actual values of the constants of Nature 'are all entirely necessary to the logical consistency of physics', or adopt the point of view that 'some, if not all, the numbers in question are fluctua- tions; that in other places of the Umverse their values would be different: At first, Hoyle favoured the second 'fluctuation' Idea, that the constants of Nature might be varying, possibly randomly, throughout space so that only in some places would the balance between the fine structure constant and the strong force constant come out 'Just right' to allow an abundance of carbon and oxygen. Thus, if this picture is adopted,18 'the curious placing of the levels in CI2 and 0 16 need no longer have the appearance of astonishing accidents. It could simply be that since creatures like ourselves depend on a balance between carbon and oxygen, we can exist only in the portions of the universe where these levels happen to be correctly placed.

If this is so, then my apparently random quirks have become part of a deep-laid scheme. If not then we are back again at a monstrous sequence of accidents.' Hoyle's successful predICtion sparked a resurgence of interest in the old Design Arguments, beloved of eighteenth- and nineteenth- century natural theologians, but with a new twist. Since ancient times there had been strong support for an argument for the existence of God (or 'the gods') from the fact that living things seemed to be tailor- made for their function. Ammals appeared to be perfectly camouflaged for their environments; parts of our bodies were delicately engineered to provide (most of) us with ease of mobility, good vision, keen hear- ing and so forth;zo the motions of the planets were favourably arranged to make the terrestrial climate conducive to the continuance of life. Large numbers of apparent coincidences existed between thmgs and persuaded many a philosopher, theologian and scientist of the past that none of this was an accident. The Universe was designed with an end in view. This end mvolved the eXIstence of life - perhaps even ourselves - and the plainness of the evidence for such design meant that there had to be a Designer. As it stands this ancient argument was difficult to refute by means of scientific facts. And it was always persuasive for those who were not scientists. After all, there are remarkable adaptations between living things and their environments all over the natural world. It is much"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"158 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e easier to undermine by means of logical or philosophical argument. But scientists are never very impressed by such arguments unless they can provide a better explanation. And so it was with the Design Argument. Despite its blinkered attitude to many of the realities of the world, it was only overthrown as a serious explanation of the exis- tence of complexity in Nature when a better explanation came along. ZI The better explanation was by means of evolution by natural selection, which showed how living things can become well adapted to their envi- ronments over the course of time under a very wide range of circum- stances, so long as the environment is not changmg too quickly. Complexity could develop from simplicity without direct Divine intervention. It is important to see what this type of Design Argument was focusing on. It is an argument about the inter-relationships between different outcomes of the laws of Nature. These are only partially deter- mined by the forms of the laws. Their form is also determined by the constants of Nature, the starting conditions, and all manner of other statistical accidents. zz In the late seventeenth century Isaac Newton discovered the laws of motion, gravitation and optics that enabled us to understand the workings of the inanimate world around us and the motions of the celestial bodies in remarkable detail. Newton's success was seized upon by natural theologians and religious apologiSts who saw the beginnings of another style of Design Argument altogether - one based not upon the outcomes of the laws of Nature but upon the form of the laws themselves. With Newton's encouragement there grew up a Design Argument based upon the evident intelligence, mathematical elegance and effectiveness of Newton's laws of Nature. A typical form of the argument would be to show that the famous inverse-square law of grav- itation was optimal for the existence of a solar system. If it had been an inverse-cube or any other inverse power of distance other than two then there could not eXist stable planetary periodic orbits. All planets would follow a spiral path into the Sun or escape to infimty.

It identifies the most deep-seated basis for 'order' in the Universe as the fact that it can be so widely and accurately described by simple mathematical laws. It then presumes that order needs an 'orderer'. The contrast between these two forms of the Design Argument - from laws and from outcomes - is dearly displayed by the effects of the discovery that organisms evolve by natural selectlOn. This quickly finished the argument from outcomes as a useful explanation of anything. 23 But the Design Argument based on laws was completely unaffected. Natural selection did not act upon laws of motion or forces of Nature nor, as Maxwell liked to stress, could selection alter the properties of atoms and molecules. In retrospect, it is dear that 1t is poss1ble to create a further, distinct form of the Design Argument wh1ch appeals to the particular values taken by the fundamental constants of Nature. It is this set of numbers that distinguishes our Universe from others, and fixes the reso- nance levels in carbon and oxygen nudei. It would be possible for the laws of Nature that we know to take the same form yet for the constants of Nature to change their values. The outcomes would then be very different. The fact that we can shift the values of constants of Nature in so many of our laws of Nature may be a reflection of our ignorance. Many physicists believe, like Eddington, that ultimately the values of the constants of Nature w1ll be shown to be inev1table and we will be able to calculate them in terms of pure numbers. However, it has become increasingly dear, as we will see in later chapters, that not all of the constants will be determined in this way. Moreover, the nature of the determination for the others may have a significant statistical aspect. What may be predicted is not the value but a probability distribution that the constant take any value.

The more I examine the universe and study the details of its architecture, the more evidence I find that the universe in some sense must have known that we were coming.' Freeman Dyson 24 The general importance of Dicke's approach to understanding the Large Numbers of cosmology was first seized upon by Brandon Carter, then a Cambridge astrophysicist but now working at Meudon in Paris. Carter had learned about the Large Number comcidences by readmg Bondi's student textbook of cosmologr 5 but had not fallen under the spell of the steady state theory that was the centrepiece of Bondi's presenta- tion. Bondi liked to assume that because the laws of Nature must be always the same, all other gross aspects of the Universe should display the same uniformity in space and tlme. 26 The steady state theory was based on precisely this premise - that the gross structure of the Umverse is always the same on the average. Bondi confessed to not having been able to follow the calculations of Eddington in his attempts to explain the Large Numbers by means of his Fundamental Theory. By contrast, he is more outspoken about Dirac's scheme to render the gravitation constant a time variable, seeing it as a further denial of the steady state principle: 'Dirac . . . is contraposed to the basic arguments of the steady-state theory, since it supposes that not only the universe changes but with it the constants of atomic physics. In some ways it may almost be said to strengthen the steady-state arguments by showing how limitless the variations are that may be imagined to arise in a changing universe.'27"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE 161 As a result of considering Dicke's explanation for the inevitabil- ity of our observation of some of the Large Number coincidences, Carter saw that it was important to stress the limitations of grand philosophical assumptions about the uniformity of the Universe. Ever since Copernicus showed that the Earth should not be placed at the centre of the known astronomical world, astronomers had used the term Copernican Principle to underwrite the assumption that we must not assume anything special about our position in the Universe. Einstein had assumed this implicitly when he first searched for mathematICal descnptions of the Universe by seeking solutIOns of his equations that ensured every place in the Universe was the same: same density, same rate of expansion, and same temperature. The steady-statesmen went one step further by seeking universes that were the same at every time in cosmic history as well. Of course, the real Universe cannot be exactly the same everywhere but to a very good approximation, when one averages over large enough regions of space, it appears to be so, to an accuracy of about one part in one hundred thousand. Carter rejected the wholesale use of the Copernican Principle in more specific situations because there are dearly restrictions on where and when observers could be present in the Universe: 'Copernicus taught us the very sound lesson that we must not assume gratuitously that we occupy a privileged central position in the Universe. Unfortunately there has been a strong (not always subconscious) tendency to extend this to a questionable dogma to the effect that our situation cannot be privileged in any sense. '28 Carter's emphasis upon the role of the Copernican Principle was encouraged by the fact that this presentation took the form of a lecture at an international astronomy meeting convened in Cracow to coincide with the SOOth anniversary of Copernicus' birth. Dicke's argument showed that there was good reason to expect"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"162 The Constants of Nature life to come on the scene several billlon years after the expansion of a Big Bang Universe began. This showed that one of the Large Numbers coincidences was an inevitable observation by such observers. This was an application of what Carter called the weak antbropic prinCIple, 'that what we can expect to observe must be restricted by the condition necessary for our presence as observers. '29 Later, Carter regretted using the term 'anthropic principle'. The adjective 'anthropic' has been the source of much confusion because it 1mplles there is something in this argument that focuses upon Homo sapiens. This is clearly not the case. It applies to all observers regardless of their form and biochemistry. But if they were not biochemically constructed ftom the elements that are made in the stars then the specific feature of the Universe that would be inevitable for them might differ ftom what is inevitable for us. However, the argument 1S not really changed if beings are poss1bly based upon silicon chemistry or physics. All the elements heavier than the chemically inert gases of hydrogen, deuterium and helium are made in the stars like carbon and require billions of years to create and distribute. Later, Carter preferred the term 'self-selection principle' to stress the way in which the neces- sary conditions for the existence of observers select, out of all the possible universes, some subset which allows observers to exist. If you are unaware that being an observer in the Universe already limits the type of universe you could expect to observe then you are liable to mtroduce unnecessary grand principles or unneeded changes to the laws of physics to explain unusual aspects of the Universe. The archetypal examples are Gerald Whitrow's discussion of the age and density of the universe 30 and Robert D1cke's explanation of the Large Numbers. Carter's considerat1on of the self-selecting influence of our exis- tence upon the sort of astronomical observations we make was inspired by reading about the Large Numbers coincidences in Bondi's book. Not knowing of Dicke's arguments of 1957 and 1961, he also noticed"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE 163 the importance of considering the inevitability of our observing the Universe close to the typical hydrogen-burning lifetIme of a typICal star. He was struck by the unnecessary way that Dirac had introduced the hypothesis of varying constants to explain these comcidences: 31 'it was completely erroneous for him to have used this coin- cidence as a motivation for a radical departure from stan- dard theory. At the time when 1 originally noticed Dirac's error, 1 simply supposed that it had been due to an emotionally neutral oversight, easily explicable as being due to the rudi- mentary state of general understanding of stellar evolution in the pioneering era of the 1930s, and that it was there- fore likely to have been already recognised and corrected by its author. My motivation in bothering to formulate some- thing that was (as 1 thought) so obvious as the anthropic principle in the form of an explicit precept, was partly provided by my later realisation that the source of such (patent) errors as that of Dirac was not limited to chance oversight or lack of information, but that it was also rooted in more deep seated emotional bias comparable with that responsible for early resistance to Darwinian ideas at the time of the \"apes or angels\" debates in the last century. 1 became aware of this in Dirac's own case when 1 learned of his reaction when his attention was explicitly drawn to the \"anthropic\" line of reasoning [about the Large Number coincidences] ... when it was first pointed out by Dicke in 1961. This reaction amounted to a straight refusal to accept the line of reasoning leading to Dicke's (in my opin- ion unassailable) conclusion that \"the statistical support for Dirac's cosmology is found to be missing\".

What 1 found astonishing here was of course the suggestion that such a preference could be relevant in such an argument ... Dirac's error provides a salutary warning that contributes to the motivation for careful formulation of the anthropic and other related principles.'32 The weak anthropic principle applies naturally to help us under- stand why variable quantities take the range of values that we find them to take in our vicinity of space and time. But there exist' coincidences' between combinations of quantities which are believed to be true constants of Nature. We will not be able to explain these coincidences by the fact that we live when the Universe is several billion years old, in conditions of relatively low density and temperature. Carter's suggested response to this was more speculative. If the constants of Nature can't change and are programmed into the overall structure of the Universe in a unique way then maybe there is some as yet unknown reason why there have to be observers in the Universe at some stage in its history? Carter dubbed this the strong antbropic pnnciple, which states 'that the Universe (and hence the fundamental parameters on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage.' The introduction of such a speculation needs evidence to support it. In this case It is that there are a number of unusual appar- ent coincidences between superficially unrelated constants of Nature that appear to be crucial for the existence of ourselves or any other conceivable form of life.

By contrast, if the conditions for life to develop and perSlSt had been found to depend only very weakly on all the constants of Nature then there would be no motivation for thinking about an anthropic principle of this stronger sort. In future chapters we shall see how this idea provokes a serious consideration of the idea that there eXist other 'universes' which possess different properties and different constants of Nature so that we might conclude that we find ourselves inhabiting one of the possible universes in which the constants and cosmic conditions have fallen out in a pattern that permits life to exist and persist - for we could not find it otherwise. A CLOSE-RUN THING? 'Do I dare Disturb the universe?' T 5 Eliot 33 We have been saying that the values of the constants of Nature are rather fortuitously 'chosen' when It comes to allowing life to evolve and persist. Let's take a look at a few more examples. The structure of atoms and molecules is controlled almost completely by two numbers that we encountered in Chapter 5: the ratio of the electron and proton masses, ~, which IS approximately equal to 1/1836 and the fine struc- ture constant a, which is approximately equal to 1/137. Suppose that we allow these two constants to change their values independently and we also assume (for simplicity) that no other constants of Nature are changed. What happens to the world if the laws of Nature stay the same?"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"166 The Constants of Nature If we follow up the consequences we soon find there ISn't much room to manoeuvre. Increase ~ too much and there can be no ordered molecular structures because it's the small value of ~ that ensures that electrons occupy well-defined positions around an atomic nucleus and don't wiggle around too much. If they did then very fine-tuned processes like DNA replication would fail. The number ~ also plays a role in the energy generation processes that fuel the stars. Here it links up With a to make the centres of stars hot enough to initiate nuclear reac- tions. If ~ exceeds about 0.005 0. 2 then there would be no stars. If modern grand unified gauge theories are on the right track then alpha must lie in the narrow range between about 1/180 and 1/85 other- wise protons will decay long before the stars can form. The Carter condition IS also shown dashed (- - -) on the picture. Its track picks out worlds where stars have convective outer regions which seem to be needed to make some systems of planets. The regions of a and ~ that are allowed and forbidden are shown in Figure 8.7. If, instead of a versus ~, we play the game of changing the strength of the strong nuclear force, as, together with that of a, then unless as > 0.30. 1 / 2 the biologically vital elements like carbon would not exist and there would not be any organic chemists. They would be unable to hold themselves together. If we increase as by just 4 per cent there is a potential disaster because a new nucleus, helium- 2 made of two protons and no neutrons, can now exist J4 and allows very fast direct nuclear reactions proton + proton ~ helium-2. Stars would rapidly exhaust their fuel and collapse to degenerate states or black holes. In contrast, if as were decreased by about 10 per cent then the deuterium nucleus would cease to be bound and the nuclear astrophysical pathways to the biological elements would be blocked.

Note that there is no claim that life has to arise or that it must endure. Clearly, if life is to endure forever it must ultimately change itS basis from life as we know it. Our knowledge of astrophysics tells us that the Sun will eventually undergo an irreversible energy crisis, expand, and engulf the Earth and the rest of the inner solar system. We will need to be gone from Earth by then, or to have transmitted the mformation needed to recreate members of our species (if it can still so be called) elsewhere.

Such forms might be little more than processors of information with a capacity to store information for future use.

Already we see a trend in our own technological societies towards the fabrication of smaller and smaller machines that consume less and less energy and produce almost no waste.

In passing we might mention that this could explain why there is no evidence of extraterrestrial life 10 the Universe. If it is truly advanced, even by our standards, it will most likely be very small, down on the molecular scale. All sorts of advantages then accrue. There is lots of room there - huge populations can be sustained. Powerful, intrinsically quantum computation can be harnessed. Little raw material is required and space travel is easier.

This turns out to be a question that we can go quite close to answenng. If the Universe began to accelerate a few billion years ago, as recent observations indicate, then it is likely that it will contmue accelerat10g forever. 39 It will never slow down and contract back to a Big Crunch. If so, then we learn that information process- ing will come to a halt. Only a finite number of bits of 1OformatlOn can be processed 10 a never-ending future. This is bad news. It occurs because the expansion is so rapid that information quality is very rapidly degraded. 40 Worse still, the accelerated expansion is so fast that light signals sent out by any civilisation will have a horizon beyond which they cannot be seen. The Universe will become partitlOned into limited regions within which commumcation is possible. An interesting observation was made along with the original proposal of the Final Anthropic Principle. We pointed out 41 that if the expansion of the Universe were found to be accelerating then 1Oformation process- ing must eventually die out. Recently, important observational evidence has been gathered by several research groups to show that the expansion of the Universe began to accelerate just a few billion years ago. But suppose the observational eVidence for the present acceleration of the Universe turns out to be incorrect. 42 What then? It is most likely that the Universe will keep on expanding forever but continuously decelerate as it does so. Life still faces an uphill battle to survive 1Odefinitely. It needs to find differences in temperature, or density, or expansion in the Universe from which it can extract useful energy by making them uniform. If it relies on mining sources of energy that exist locally - dead stars, evap- orating black holes, decaying elementary particles - then eventually it runs into the problem that well-worked coal mines inevitably face: it costs more to extract the energy than can be gained from it. Beings of the far future will find that they need to economise on energy usage - economise on hving 10 fact!

Life must then begin to die out. By contrast, if life does not confine its attentiOns to mmmg local sources of energy the long-range forecast looks much bnghter. The Universe does not expand at exactly the same rate in every direction. There are small differences in speed from one direction to another which are attnbutable to gravitational waves of very long, probably infi- nite, wavelength threading space. The challenge for super-advanced life- forms is to find a way of tapping into this potentially unlimited energy supply.

If it is possible to engineer the conditions needed to send information backwards in time then this offers a strategy for escape from a lifeless future for suitably ethereal forms of 'life' defined by information processing and storage. Don't invest your efforts in perfecting means of extractmg usable energy from an environment that is being dnven closer and closer to a lifeless equi- librium. Instead, travel backwards in time to an era where conditions are far more hospitable. Indeed, travel is not strictly necessary, just transmit the instructions needed for re-emergence. Often, people are worried about apparent factual paradoxes that can emerge from allowing backward time travel. Can't you kill yourself or your parents in infancy so that you cannot eXist? All these paradoxes are Impossibilities. They arise because you are introducing a physical and logical impossibility by hand. It helps to think of space and time in the way that Einstein taught us: as a single block of spacetime, see Figure 8.9. Now step outside spacetime and look in at what happens there. Histories of individuals are paths through the block. If they curve back upon themselves to form closed loops then we would judge time travel to occur. But the paths are what they are. There is no history that is 'changed' by doing that. Time travel allows us to be part of the past but not to change the past. The only time-travelling histories that are possible are self-consistent paths. On any closed path there is no well- defined division between the future and the past.

And what are these 'changes'? What are these' other worlds' where the constants are different and life cannot exist? One plausible view of the Universe, is that there is one and only one way for the constants and laws of Nature to be. Universes are difficult tricks to bring off and the more complicated they are the more pieces there are that need to fit together. The values of the constants of Nature are thus a j1gsaw puzzle w1th only one solutiOn and this solutiOn 1S completely specified by the one true theory of Nature. If this were true then it would make no more sense to talk about other hypothetical universes in wh1ch the constants of Nature take different values than it would to talk of square circles. There simply could not be other worlds. 3 The fact that the one and only possible universe was such as to allow life to develop and persist would be just a brute fact about the world, albeit an extremely agreeable one. 4 Saddled with this 'rigid world' view we would be unable to say anything further about seemmgly fortUitous values of the constants of Nature. In the future we could only wait and watch as a sequence of experimenters checked to more and more decimal places that the values of all the constants of Nature were just as predicted. A rigid world offers no scope for things to be other than what they are; when it comes to the basic laws, forces and constants of Nature,S there are no alternat1ves. By contrast, the 'flexi world' V1ew offers scope for variation. If there are (or can be) 'other' universes, if some of the constants of Nature are not rigidly specified by the final theory, or if our own Universe displays very different structures beyond our horizon, then the strong anthropic prmciple has a clear meaning. Suppose that Universes exist in wh1ch the constants of Nature take on a wide range of different values.

For if many (or even all) possible universes 'exist' in some sense, then somewhere within the whole constellation of possible combinations of the values of the constants will fall out situations that permit observers to evolve. Inevitably, we hve in one of these universes, no matter how special its properties might appear to be when viewed over the entire spectrum of possibilities. Thus, Carter proposes that 'It is of course always philosophically possible - as a last resort, when no stronger physical argument is available - to promote a predution based on the strong anthropic prin- ciple to the status of an explanation by thinking in terms of a \"world ensemble\". By this I mean an ensemble of universes characterised by all conceivable combinations of initial conditions and fundamental constants ...

A prediction based on the strong anthropic principle may be regarded as a demonstration that the feature under consideration is common to all members of the cognizable subset.'6 The idea of there being other universes is not a new one. There was speculation about the possibility in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as part of the debate about life on other worlds. There was also considerable discussion in a context very similar to that of the strong anthropic principle. Similar life-supporting coincidences involv- ing the form of the laws of gravity and motion, the constitution of the Earth and the solar system, and human biology had been known for a long tlffie.

The principle allowed one to consider actual motions between two points taking all possible paths. If one evaluated a partic- ular quantity, called the 'action', for each path, and required the actual path taken to have the least value of the action, then this ensured that the path was identical to that predicted by Newton's laws. Eventually physicists found that all laws of physics could be derived from 'action principles' of thiS form. Maupertuis proudly announced that he could tell what the 'best' of all pOSSible worlds meant and what the other worlds were: 'best' meant least action and the other inferior worlds are those where motion does not follow least action paths. Indeed, during the nineteenth century there was even an attempt to explain fossils as relics of these failed worlds of non-minimal action. By the end of the nineteenth century the evident vastness of the astronomical Universe made it easy to speculate that elsewhere there should be worlds governed by natural laws different from our own. Wallace, writing in 1903, argues that 'no two stars, no two clusters, no two nebulae are alike. Why then should there be other universes of the Jame matter and subject to the Jame laws ... ? Of course, there may be, and probably are, other universes, perhaps of other kinds of matter and subject to other laws.'7 Modern physics is built around the derivation of the laws of Nature from action prinCiples. It is the most effiCient way to find them and allows far greater generalisation and unification of different laws.

There do seem to be constants of Nature that are not absolutely fixed by an all-encompassing Theory of Everything. Some appear there but are allowed to take a whole contin- uous range of values.

One of the big questions facing physicists today is the determi- nation of just how many of the defining constants of Nature will be Uniquely and completely specified by a Theory of Everything like the current favoured superstring theory, called 'M Theory'. Those that are omitted from this determination will be allowed to take all sorts of different values without affecting the inner logic and self-conSistency of the Theory of Everything. They could have been different if partic- ular sequences of events that had led to their appearance in the early stages of the Universe had developed differently.

We are now going to look at two of them in more detail because the way in which their unusual values are explicable creates an entirely new perspective on the Universe that provides a plethora of â¢other worlds' wherein the Anthropic Principle finds a natural and unavoidable application. As we look more closely at the expansion of the Universe we find that it IS delicately poised, expanding very close to the critical divid- ing line that separates universes which are expanding fast enough to overcome the pull of gravity and keep going forever from those which will ultimately reverse into a state of global contraction and head towards a cataclysmic Big Crunch at some finite time in the future. In fact, so close are we to this critical divide that our observations cannot tell us for sure what the long-range forecast holds. Indeed, it IS the close prox- imity of the expansion to the diVide that is the big mystery: a priOri it seems highly unlikely to exist by chance. Again, thiS IS not totally unex- pected. Universes that expand too fast are unable to aggregate material into galaxies and stars, so the building blocks of complex life cannot be made. By contrast, universes that expand too slowly end up collaps- ing into contraction before the billions of years needed for stars to form have passed. Only universes that lie very close to the cntical divide can live long enough and expand gently enough for the stars and planets to form. It is no accident that we find ourselves living billions of years after the apparent beginning of the expansion of the Universe and witnessing a state of expansion that lies close to the critical divide (see Figure 9.2). A second distinctive feature of our Universe is its uniformity. The lumpiness level beyond the scale of galaxies is very small, on aver- age only about one part In one hundred thousand. This is important because if it were significantly larger then galaxies would have rapidly degenerated Into dense lumps, and black holes would form long before"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":",t< , .. câ¢â¢â¢ \".\"\" .\", â¢â¢ - - FIr\" 0.2 11 ......... _ ~ \"\"\" \" rM _ f ijI< .. \" -- \"\"\"\"\"\"\" \"\"\" ~ - -. ~ ..,... -. _ ..... \"1-- u.;.\"\", \"\"\" ~ _p. ~ ... _-n.I .. -... ~<f_,....,.....,aJ ,... ho _ \"\"\"\"'\" rM -. _ <f \"\"\"\".\",.. ~l.- ........

This theory of the very early Umverse introduces an historical interlude called 'inflation'. It creates a slight gloss on the simple picture of an expanding universe. But thiS gloss has huge implicatlOns. The standard Big Bang picture of the expanding universe, that has been with us since the I 920s, has a particular property: the expansion is decelerating. No matter whether the Universe is destined to expand forever, or to collapse back in on itself towards a Big Crunch, the expan- sion is always being decelerated by the gravitational attraction exerted by all the matenal m the Universe. The deceleratlOn is simply a consequence of the attractive character of the force of gravity. It had always been assumed that gravity would ensure that matter and energy would attract other forms of matter and energy. But in the I970s particle physicists began to find that their theories of how matter behaved at high temperatures contained new forms of matter, called scalar fields, whose gravitational effect upon each other could be repul- sive. I I If they were to become the largest contributors to the density of the Universe at some stage in itS very early history, then the decel- eration of the Universe would be replaced by a surge of acceleration. Remarkably, it appeared that if such scalar fields do exist, then they invariably come to be the most influential constituent of the Universe very soon after it starts expandmg, and their influence can be quite brief but deCISive. Soon afterwards they should decay without trace into the cosmic sea of ordinary matter and radiation. The inflationary universe theory proposes that a brief period of accelerated expansion occurs very early in the history of the Universe (see Figure 9.3). This could have occurred because one of the ubiq- uitous scalar fields came to dominate the density of matter in the Universe. This field then needs to decay quite rapidly. When it does so, its energy heats up the Universe in a complicated way, while the Universe resumes its usual decelerating expansion. This brief inflationary episode sounds innocuous.

The fact that we are still so close to this divide, after about thirteen billion years worth of expan- sion, is quite fantastic. Since any deviatIon from lymg precisely on the critical divide grows steadily with the passage of time, the expansion must have begun extraordinarily close to the divide in order to be so close still today (we cannot lie exactly on it I2 ). But the tendency of the expansion to veer away from the critical divide is just another conse- quence of the attractiveness of the gravitational force.

If gravity is repulsive and the expansion accelerates, then while this lasts, it will drive the expansion ever closer to the critical divide. If inflation lasted for long enough,13 it could explain why our visible universe is still so surprisingly close to the critical divide. This life- supporting feature of the Universe would not need to arise from special starting conditions at the Big Bang. Another by-product of a short bout of cosmic acceleration is that any irregularities in the expansion of the Universe get ironed out and the expansion very quickly goes at the same rate in every direction, just as we see today. This offers an explanation for the extremely symmet- ric character of the expansion of the Umverse, a character trait that has always struck cosmologists as mysterious and unlikely. There are so many more ways to be disorderly than to be orderly that one would have expected a universe pulled out of the hat at random to be a very asymmetrical and disorderly one. 14 If inflation occurred, the whole visible universe around us today will have expanded from a region that IS much smaller than it would have originated from had the expansion always decelerated, as it does in the conventional (non-inflationary) Big Bang theory. The smallness of our inflationary beginnings has the nice feature of offering an expla- nation both for the high degree of umformity that exists in the over- all expansion of the Universe, and for the very small non-uniformities seen by NASA's COBE satellite. These are the seeds that subsequently develop into galaxies and clusters (see Figure 9.4). If the Universe accelerates, then the whole of our visible universe can arise from the expansion of a region that is small enough for light signals to traverse at very early times. This light traversal enables condi- tions within that primordial region to be kept smooth. Any irregulari- ties get smoothed out very quickly. In the old, non-Inflationary Big Bang theory the situation was very different. Our visible part of the Universe had to emerge from a region vastly bigger than one that light rays can co-ordinate and smooth.

As one looks into the issue, it IS surprismg how many points of similarity there are between the virtual history debate and the discussion of the anthropic impact of varying constants. The contem- plation of the consequences of slightly changing the constants of Nature requires the invention of different past histories for the Universe, some of which have the novelty of neither containing ourselves nor any other sentient beings. Cosmologists do not have a full theory that allows all these changes to be incorporated self- consistently but they typically assume that the same laws of change will govern events. Although the basis for the changes in constants or even the 'initial conditions' of the Universe is speculative, the calculation of the consequences can be qUite straightforward, a bit like running a computer program with different starting values. By contrast, tinkering with an historical event does not require some change in the laws of Nature, but predicting the outcome is usually too complicated for one to have faith in the results, unless you have the assurance of a novelist. Historical sequences of events are classIc examples of complex systems. They exhibit sensitivity to small changes which make it impos- Sible to predict the future with certainty even though we might be able to understand what has happened in the past. ThiS asymmetry IS a feature of all chaotic behaviour, but history is far more unpredictable than a chaotic process. Chaotic processes usually allow one to predict"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"A L T E R I N G CON 5 TAN T 5 AND R E W R I TIN G HIS TOR Y 195 the statistical pattern of future events in a definite way. Historical events have an added sensitivity that renders them unpredictable in prinCIple as well as in practice because they involve participants With free will, or at least with the illusion of it. Weather is hard to predict because it is chaotically sensitive to uncertainties in its present state. But forecasting the weather has no direct effect on the weather. Economic and social forecasters are not so lucky. If a government minister publicly predicts what the economy will do, or a pollster predicts the outcome of an election, these predic- tions will alter the outcome of what is being forecast in a way that it is logically impossible to include in the origmal forecast. 2I This is not to say that these events are in some way beyond the rule of logic and intrinsically unpredictable. They can be predicted accurately but that accuracy can only be absolutely guaranteed if the predictions are not made known to the individuals whose actions are being predicted. If they are made known to them, then those individuals can always act to falsify the predictions. These events then become unpredictable m prin- ciple, not Just in practice. Virtual histories have become the basis for many fantasies and Hollywood movies, like It~ a Wondeiful Life, in which a suicidal James Stewart is shown how much worse things would have been had he never lived. Alternative outcomes to the Second World War are a favourite scenano for virtual historical novels, notably Kingsley Amis's The Alteration,22 Len Deighton's SS_GB,23 or Robert Harris's Fatherland. 24 Often films like Back to the Future have used science fiction scenarios of time travel or parallel universes to actualise alternative histones and even bring them into collision with our own. The science fiction scenarios feed on the sCientifically possible idea that all possible histories exist. Changing the past just moves the hero, like the wanderer in Jorge Luis Borges's Garden of Forking Paths,25 on to one of the many other histori- cal trajectories that intersect or pass close to the road that would other- wise have been trodden. The passionate rejection of virtual histories by many historians"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"196 The Constants of Nature is very interesting. It is fervent but not very compellmg. The philoso- pher MIchael Oakeshott claIms that when the historian 'considers by a kind of ideal experiment what might have happened as well as what the evidence obliges him to believe did happen [he steps] ... outside the current of historical thought . . . It is possible that had St. Paul been captured and killed when his friends lowered him from the walls of Damascus, the Christian religion might never have become the centre of our civilisation. And on that account, the spread of Christianity might be attributed to St. Paul's escape ... But when events are treated in this manner, they cease at once to be historical events. The result is not merely bad or doubtful history, but the complete rejection of history . . . The distinction . . . between essential and incidental events does not belong to historical thought at all; it is a monstrous incursion of science into the world of history ... The Historian is never called upon to consider what might have happened had circumstances been different.'26 The 'monstrous incursion of science' is presumably that of rigid determinism but this is a strange thing to object to. There is no doubt that history was surely a deterministic sequence of events although the sequence may be of such complexity that any hope of connecting all the causes to their consequences is doomed to failure. But commenta- tors hke Oakeshott are also concerned that virtual histories tempt us to pick out some facts arbitrarily and make their significance pIvotal, whilst viewing others as mere 'aCCIdents'. Benedetto Croce thinks counterfactual history IS dlsastrous 27 for just this reason: 'Historical necessity has to be affirmed and continually reaffirmed in order to exclude from history the \"conditional\" which has no rightful place there ... What"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"ALTERING CONSTANTS AND REWRITING HISTORY 197 is forbidden is ... the anti-historical and illogical \"if'. Such an \"if' arbitrarily divides the course of history into neces- sary facts and accidental facts ... and the second is mentally eliminated in order to espy how the first would have devel- oped under its own lines if it had not been disturbed by the second. This is a game which all of us in moments of distraction or idleness indulge in, when we muse on the way our life might have turned out if we had not met a certain person ... [but] if we went on to such a full explo- ration of reality, the game would soon be up.' For these wnters, all the historian can do to improve our under- standing of what went on in the past is to provide an even more detailed account of events. These cntics worry about the dlVlslon of events into significant and insignificant but have no way of saymg which is which except by subjective impression. Nor is there good reason why counter- factual questions should not play a part in interrogating the finished reconstruction of events that is eventually labelled 'history'. This bias is very dear in a revealmg account of the historian's aims in the influ- ential little book What is History? by the English social historian and historical determinist E.H. Carr: 'From the multiplicity of sequences of cause and effects [the historian] extracts those, and only those, which are histor- ically significant; and the standard of historical significance is his ability to fit them into his pattern of rational expla- nation and interpretation. Other sequences of cause and effect have to be rejected as accidental, not because the rela- tion between cause and effect is different, but because the sequence itself is irrelevant. The historian can do nothing with it; it is not amenable to rational interpretation, and has no meaning either for the past or the present.'"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"198 The Con 51 an 15 0 f N a I u r e However, despite this strident opposition to counterfactual rewrit- ing of history, there have been noted historians who have been sympa- thetic to spinning virtual his tones.

In 1907 Trevelyan wrote an essay enti- tled 'If Napoleon had won the battle of Waterloo' and there have been a host of slmllar fantasles ever smce, feedmg on a form of selectlve causation well dlsplayed by an example of Bertrand Russell's: 'Industrialism is due to modern science, modern science is due to Galileo, Galileo is due to the fall of Constantinople, the fall of Constantinople is due to the migration of the Turks, the migration of the Turks is due to the desiccation of Central Asia. Therefore the fundamental study in search- ing for historical causes is hydrography.' One contemporary journalist, Raymond Burke, now a Scient!ftc American columnist, ran an entire TV series in Britain for a period under the title of Connections that traced smularly bizarre causal chains of events.

Some analysts have attempted to predict the course of economies if certam industries had not developed or if the railways had not existed, in an attempt to discover how much benefit the whole economy gamed from specific industries. To the modern physlclst the arguments of ideallsts like Oakeshott, which deny real accountability to cause and effect, and seem merely to protect their subjects of study from encroachment by others with more rigorous methods, seem wide of the mark.

They may also tend to organIse themselves mto particular 'critical' states which display a maxi- mum degree of sensitivity to small changes, and it is this state of affairs that allows an overall balance to persist.

In seekmg to establish or cast reasonable doubt upon liability it will be necessary for a barrister to persuade the jury by arguing what would have occurred had the defendant not acted as he did.

The defend- ing counsel mIght argue that there is another virtual history in which the harm befell the victIm even when his client did not act as he did and so he cannot have been to blame. Such strategies witness to a beltef in the importance of virtual histories as a way of testing the stability of particular accounts of history. Of course, identifying the alterna- tive histOries IS not a guarantee that the truth will appear. Sometimes cause and effect are entwined in a very awkward way. Here is a notori- ous legal example about the ambiguity of causes: 28 'There is an old story about a man about to cross a desert. He has two enemies. In the night the first enemy slips into his camp, and puts strychnine in his water bottle. Later the same night, the second enemy, not knowing of this, slips into his camp and puts a tiny puncture in the water bottle.

But he failed, for he only deprived the victim of strychnine, and you cannot murder someone by doing that.' Historians like Niall Ferguson argue that virtual histones are important. His critics argue that there are an unlimited number of alterna- tives to consider, which renders reconstruction hopeless. In response Ferguson argues that only a few of the alternative scenarios need be seriously confronted: 'only those alternatives which we can show on the basis of contemporary evidence that contemporaries actually considered. '29 ObvlOusly, the reasonable alternatives played a role in the thinking of the protagonist. They would have been his hypothetical futures. How they appeared would have been a factor in the choice of action that was made and therefore essential to our account if we are fully to understand why that choice was made. This excursion into the philosophy of history aims to show that it is engaged in a lively debate that is curiously analogous to that going on Within cosmology about the usefulness of hypothesismg universes ( or other parts of our Universe) in which the constants of Nature were different from what we find them to be here and now.

SCience fiction writers have made a good living out of speculating about extra dimen- sions which enable us to do magical things in our three-dimensional world by slipping 10 and out of the visible world. In the nmeteenth century there was a famous confidence trickster who claimed to have access to other dimensions so that he could perform 'impossible' feats: unknotting loops of string, turning left-handed spirals into right- handed spirals, mov1Og an object from Inside a spherical glass cham- ber to its outSide without penetrating the surface. To see how stepping into the fourth dimension might help you perform these tricks, think about the jump from two to three dimen- sions. Place a circular loop of string flat on the table around a lump of sugar. There is no way that the sugar lump can get outside the loop without touching the string if It stays in contact with the flat two- dimensional surface of the table. But if the sugar lump can pass into the third dimenSIOn of space this is easily achieved. Just lift it up and put it down again outside the circle of string. Similarly If you put a right-handed spiral coil flat on the table there is no way that it can be changed into a left-handed one by just moving it around on the two- dimensional world of the table-top. But if we lift it into the third dimension and turn it over then it is possible to change the handed- ness of the spiral (see Figure 10. I). Despite this fascination with the unseen realms of matter and spirit, there was very little motivation for eighteenth- and nineteenth- century scientists to think about the dimensionality of space.

The great German philosopher, Immanuel Kant was far more interested in science than philosophy during his early career in Konigsberg (see Figure 10.2). He was a great admirer of Newton and his laws of gravity and motion, and applied himself to under- stand and apply them to great astronomical problems like the origin of the solar system. As Kant pondered the significance of the special form of Newton's law of gravity he came to ask himself a question that had not been asked before: 3 'why does space have three dimen- sIOns?' Kant had noticed a very profound thmg: that Newton's famous inverse-square law of gravity4 was intimately connected with the fact that space has three dimensions. If space had four dimensions then gravity would vary as the mverse-cube of distance, If it had 100 dimensions then as an mverse 99th power of distance. In general, an N-dlmensional world exhibits a force law for gravitf which falls off as the (N-I)st power of distance. 6 By the same token, the constant of Nature that appears as the constant of proportionality in these laws w111 have a value that is determined in part by the numbers of dimen- sions of space.

ObservatiOns like these enable us to provide Einstein with a possible answer to hIS problem. We know that the penmeter of a circle of radius R has extent 21tR. The surface area of a sphere is 41tR 2 â¢ Likewise, the area of a circle is 1tR 2 and the volume of a sphere is 41tR 3 /3. Now think about 'spheres' in N dImensions. Mathematicians can easily calculate what the surface area and the volume of such spheres will be. It is clear that, A(N), the area of the N-dimensional ball of radiUs R will be proportional to R N - 1 and its volume, YeN), proportiOnal to R N , but not at all obvious what the numerical quantities like '41t' or '41t/3' will be. The formulae are shown in the graph of Figure 10.10. The remarkable feature of the pIcture is that as the dimension of space increases so the numerical factors grow to become enormously different from I. They don't grow in proportion to N, or even as 2 N â¢ They grow as JIJN. So, we have an answer for Emstem. The ubiquity of small numerical factors in the laws of Nature and the formulae of physics is a consequence of the world having a very small number of space dimensions. If we lived in a world with 20 dImensions then sImple estimates that ignored numerical factors in physical formulae would be extremely inaccurate in many cases and Einstein would be asking why they are always so mconveniently large.

THE SAD CASE OF PAUL EHRENFEST 'Ehrenfest was not merely the best teacher in our profes- sion whom I have ever known; he was also passionately preoccupied with the development and destiny of men, especially his students. To understand others, to gain their friendship and trust, to aid anyone embroiled in outer or inner struggles, to encourage youthful talent - all this was his real element, almost more than his immersion in scien- tific problems.' Albert Einstein Paul Ehrenfest was a doubting Thomas; but it was himself he doubted. He was a very talented Austrian physicist who worked with many of the greatest names in science during the early part of the twentieth century: Einstein, Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Pauli, Dirac - all benefited from his help. Above all, he was an incisive critic, able to pick on the weak points of any argument: the conscience of physics. He was also famous for off-beat remarks, hke: 26 'Why do I have such good students? Because I am so stupid: or 'Do you say that to make a point, or only because it happens to be true?' Ehrenfest made important contributions to physics in several areas and undergraduates studying quantum mechanics will mvariably come across 'Ehrenfest's theorem'. But Ehrenfest's standards were so high that Figure 10.10 The variation if the area and volume if a spherical ball in N dimensions with radius equal to one unit if length.

His mother died in 1890, when he was 10, and his father, who had suffered chronic bad health, died six years later. Despite the high esteem in which he was held by others, and which led to his mvitation to hold the professorship of physics at Leiden in 1912 when he was only 32 years old (Figure 10.1 I), Ehrenfest suffered from low self-esteem. He became frustrated by his inability to keep up with the fast pace of developments in quantum physics and their increasingly mathematical nature. In May 1931 he wrote to Niels Bohr that 'I have completely lost contact with theoretical physics. I cannot read anything any more and feel myself incompe- tent to have even the most modest grasp about what makes sense in the flood of articles and books. Perhaps I cannot at all be helped any more.' His despair deepened, exacerbated by the severe mental problems of his Down's Syndrome son, Wassik. Ehrenfest's famous supervisor, Ludwig Boltzmann, had committed suicide in 1906, despairing at the lack of recognition of his work. Paul Ehrenfest did the same on 25 September 1933, shooting himself, after first shooting his son, in the doctor's waiting room. His last letter of explanatiOn to his closest scientific friends and his students was never sent. 27 Ehrenfest is part of our story because, in 1917, he was the first to notice 28 how many aspects of physical laws were strongly depend- ent upon the number of dimensions of space. Buildmg upon Kant's inSIghts into the lmk between the inverse-square law of gravity and the dimensions of space, Ehrenfest noticed that it was only possible to have planets moving around a central mass (like the Sun) m stable orbits if the world had three dimensions.

Three- dimensional worlds are very unusual. 3D They impose special properties on the laws and constants of Nature. Yet, in 1917, Ehrenfest went no further and drew no special philo- sophical conclusions from his results. He was not the first to notice that there was something special about planetary orbits in three-dimensional worlds. William Paley had spelt out the unique life-supporting features of the inverse-square law of gravity back in 1802, and Wallace's 1905 survey of Man~ Piau in the Universe had reiterated these special features. But these authors had written before the quantum theory of matter had emerged and Ehrenfest was able to make a much fuller and deeper case for the physical uniqueness of three-dimenslOnal worlds. THE SPECIAL CASE OF GERALD WHITROW 'The universe is real but you can't see it. You have to imag- ine it.' Alexander Calder\" The direct anthropic link between the number of dimensions of space and the existence of living observers was first made by the Enghsh cosmologist Gerald Whitrow, in 1955. Asking the question Why do we observe the Universe to possess three dimensions?' he sought to provide a new type of answe~2 by arguing that thinking observers could only exist in three-dimensional worlds. Indeed, he suggested that it would be possible to deduce the dimensionality of the world from the fact that we, or another form of intelligent hfe, exist: 'this fundamental topological property of the world could be inferred as the unique natural concomitant of"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"NEW DIMENSIONS 221 certain other contingent characteristics associated with the evolution of the higher forms of terrestrial life, in particu- lar of Man, the formulator of the problem.' He elaborated his arguments in a popular book on cosmology published four years later 33 and attempted to eliminate the poss1bihty of a life- supporting two-dimensional world by arguing that the inevitable inter- sections of connections between nerve cells in two dimensions would short-circuit the creation of a complex neural network. Whitrow's approach is the first application of what would now be called the 'Anthropic Principle'. It 1S earlier than Dicke's application of it to the problem of varying G and the Large Numbers Hypothesis. Using what we know today, we can enlarge it a little further. And if we are going to contemplate what the world might be like if its laws stayed the same but the number of dimensions of space were differ- ent, why stop there? Why not ask what would happen if the number of dimenslOns of time were different as well? 34 The poss1bility of universes w1th d1fferent dimensions of both space and time has been explored by a number of scientists. 35 Just as when we considered umverses with other dimensions of space and one dimension of time, we can assume that the laws of Nature keep the same mathemat1cal forms but perm1t the numbers of dimensions of space and t1me to range freely over all possibilities. The situation is sununarised 10 the picture shown 36 10 F1gure 10.12. The chequer-board of all possibilities can be whittled down dramatically by the imposition of a small number of reasonable require- ments that seem likely to be necessary for information processing, memory, and therefore 'life', to exist. If we want the fUture to be deter- mined by the present then we eliminate all those regions of the board marked 'unpred1ctable'.

The overall effect of extra time dimensions 1S to make complex structures highly unstable unless they are frozen in conditions of extremely low temperature. 39 When we look at worlds w1th dimensions of space and time other than 3 plus I we run into a striking problem. Worlds with more than one time dimension do not allow the future to be pred1cted from the present. In this sense they are rather like worlds with no t1me dimen- sion. A complex organised system, like that needed for life, would not be able to use the information gleaned from its environment to inform its future behaviour. It would remain simple: too simple to store infor- mation and evolve.

THE STRANGE CASE OF THEODOR KALUZA AND OSKAR KLEIN 'The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves.' Abraham Lincoln Theodor Kaluza (1885-1954) was the only child of a family of schol- ars that had lived in what was then 40 the German town of Ratibor for more than three centuries. His father Max was a renowned scholar of English language and literature but Theodor showed an early talent for mathematics and was enrolled as a student at the University of Konigsberg where he completed a doctorate in 19 I O. So far, the young Kaluza seemed to be on course for a career as a successful university professor and researcher. He was a friendly man of wide interests, with a keen sense of humour, who spoke and wrote in fifteen languages, but was clearly not much given to the practicalities of life. His son tells us that it was characteristic of his approach to practical matters that in his early thirties he decided that it was necessary for him to learn to swim. He obtained a book about swimming, read it carefully, jumped into the water and swam successfully on his first attempt. Such, he claimed, was the power of theoretical knowledge! But for some reason Kaluza's career stalled. Instead of remaining, like other talented young scientists, for just two or three years in an assistant position at the university, he stayed there for twenty years, never achieving promotion to a professorship. It was dunng this lengthy"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"NEW 0 I MEN 5 ION 5 225 apprenticeship that he decided to write to Einstein about his new ideas linking electricity, magnetism and gravity. The time was April 1919 and Emstein was already renowned amongst physicists for his work on relativity, gravity and atomic physics, although he was not yet a house- hold name amongst the general public. Kaluza had noticed that by adding an extra dimension of space to the world it becomes possible to unite Einstein's theory of gravity with Maxwell's theory of electricity and magnetism in a very economical way. Einstem took a long time to respond to Kaluza's letter but eventually he replied with enthusiasm, urging Kaluza to prepare the work for publication. Einstein added his impnmatur by communicating the work to the Journal oj the Prussian Academll in December of 192I. Kaluza's idea was certamly dramatic. Electromagnetism, he claimed, was really just like gravity propagating in an extra dimension of space. But while the theory was mathematically very elegant it had to face up to the awkward question: 'if there is an extra dimension of space why don't we feel itS effects?' Kaluza didn't address this awkward question at all. An answer to this conundrum was provided in 1926 by the Swedish mathematical physicist Oskar Klein (1894--1977), one of Kaluza's former students. Klem had been developing rather similar ideas to Kaluza but had put them aSide when he saw that Kaluza had beaten him to it. He had written to Niels Bohr that 'the origin of Planck's constant may be sought in the periodicity of the fifth dimen- sion'.4z It was simple. The extra dimension of space is extremely small and circular (about 10- 30 centimetres in circumference) and so its pres- ence is imperceptible. The fine structure constant of Nature that we see in three dimensions takes a numerical value that is controlled by the size of the extra dimension. This Kaluza-Klein theory, as it became known, was of interest for a while but then fell mto the background until the 1980s when it re-emerged to become a focus of interest for physicists.

The trick was simply that dimen- sionality had to be undemocratIC: there could be more than three dimen- sIOns of space but they had to be small and unchanging if they were to aVOId altenng the character of the world that we experience. Forces of Nature must not democratIcally propagate theIr mfluences in all the dimensions: the extra dimensions of space had to be very much smaller in extent than the three we are famIlIar with. In the I980s, phYSIcists started to resurrect the Ideas of Kaluza and Klein to see If by addmg yet more dImensions it mIght be possi- ble to lom the strong and weak forces of Nature together with elec- tromagnetism and gravity. If this idea could be made to work then the constants of Nature that described the strengths of these forces would be determined by the size of each of the dimensIOns responsible. For a while It looked as though this novel idea might just work. Serious attempts were made to calculate the value of the fine structure constant in theories with extra dimensions. 43 But gradually the flaws began to show. The simple extra dimensions of Kaluza and Klein could not mimic all the complicated properties of the strong and weak forces of Nature nor accommodate the properties of the idiosyncratic elemen- tary particles they governed. Still, the lessons learned from this approach were Important and could be applied to the new superstrmg theories that repaired the defects of the Kaluza-Klein theories, as we shall see. The most Important was that when we open our minds to the possi- bility that the world possesses more than three dimensions of space then the true constants of Nature must live in the total number of dImensIOns. The shadows of them that we see in our three-dimensional world can be qUIte dIfferent m value and, most striking of all, need not even be constant.

VARYING CONSTANTS ON THE BRANE 'There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.' Edith Wharton\" The most interesting consequence of adding extra dimensions of space is that it permits the observed constants of Nature to change. If the world really has four dimensions of space then the true constants of Nature exist in four dimensions. If we move around in only three of those dimensions then we will see or feel only three-dimensional 'shad- ows' of the true four-dimensional constants. But those shadows need not be constant. If the extra dimension increases in size, just as our three dimensions of the Universe are expanding, then our three- dimensional constants Will decrease at the same rate. This immediately tells us that if any extra dimensions are changing they must be chang- ing rather slowly otherwise we would not have called our constants 'constants' at all. Take a traditional constant of Nature like the fine structure constant. If the size of the extra dimension 45 of space is R then the value of the three-dimensional fine structure' constant', a, will vary in proportion to I/R 2 as R changes. Imagine that we are in an expand- ing universe of four dimensions but we can only move around in three of the dimensions. The forces of electricity and magnetism can 'see' all the four dimensions and we will find that our three-dimensional part of them will weaken as the fourth dimension gets bigger.

A possible scenario imagines that the Universe begms WIth all its space dimensions behaving in a democratic fashion but then some of the dimensions get trapped and remain static and small ever after, leaving just three to become big, expanding to become the astronomical Universe that we observe today (see Figure 10.13). In 1982, string theorists first suggested a spectacular answer to an old problem: how do you marry the quantum theory of matter to Einstein's theory of gravity. All previous attempts had failed miserably. They invariably predicted that some measured quantity should be infi- nite. 46 These 'infinIties' plagued all theories with only three dimensions of space and one of time.

If one gives up the idea that the most basic entities are point- like, with zero size, and allows there to be more than three dimensions of space, then the mfimties miraculously disappear, all cancelling out. As with the earlier Kaluza-Klein theories these extra dimensIOns can't be changmg sigmficantly today or we would see changes in the' constants' of Nature that govern the structure of our three-dimensIOnal world. Again, they were assumed to be trapped by unknown forces on a very small scale, close to the fundamental Planck length scale of 10- 33 cm. The simple idea that only three of the dimensions of space take part 10 the expanslOn of the Universe higWlghts the central mysteries about the dimensions of space and time. We are findmg that stnng theories pick out special numbers of dimensions of space and time together. No reason has been found within those theories to show why only one of the speCified number of space-time dimensIOns is a time; nor why three dimensions have become large. If the others are confined to some very small extent then we need to know whether It had to be three dimensions that became large or whether this number fell out at random and could have been different. If the number of spacIOus dimensions was picked at random by the way events fell out near the beginning of the expansion of the Universe then there might be a different number of large dimensions elsewhere 10 the Umverse beyond our horizon. A random choice would mean that this aspect of the world allowed no further explanatIOn in the normal reductionist sense: only in worlds with three space and one time dimension would we be here to notice the fact. Recently, another approach to the problem of dimensions and constants has emerged. Rather than simply trap extra dimenSIOns so that they can't change, it allows only gravity to have an influence in all the dimensions of space.

Bouzigues worked on the staff at the Pierrelatte nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in France. One of his routine tasks was to measure the composition of ores coming from uranium mines near the river Oklo in the former French colony now known as the West African Repubhc of Gabon, about 440 kilometres from the Atlantic coast, shown in Figure I 1. 1. Time after time he checked the fraction of the natural ore that was in the form of the uranium-235 isotope compared to that 10 the form of the uranium-238 isotope by conducting analy- ses of uranium hexafluoride gas samples. 4 The difference between the two isotopes is crucial. Naturally occurring uranium that we mine out of the Earth is almost all in the form of the 238 isotope. 5 This form of uranium will not create a cham of self-sus taming nuclear reactions. If it did, our planet would have exploded a long time ago. In order to make a bomb or a productive chain reaction It IS necessary to have ttaces of the active 235 isotope of uranium. In natural uranium no more than a fractton of a per cent is in the 235 form, whereas about 20 per cent is required for a chain of nuclear reactions to be initiated.

They were important checks on the quality of materials that would ulttmately be used 10 the French nuclear mdustry. This was routine work but on that June day in 1972 his attention to detail was rewarded.

But there was no evidence of any of the mtense radioactivity that would accompany spent fuel, and no depleted uranIUm hexafluoride was missing from the plant's inventory. Some form of terronst theft of material or extraterrestrial deposit was even suggested. But gradually the investigations found the source of the discrepancy to lie in the natural uranIUm deposits them- selves. There was a naturally low 235 to 238 ratiO in the mine site seams. The investigators looked at each step of the uranium ore's trans- portation and processing, from the original ore mmmg and local milling in Gabon, to the processing in France before it reached the enrichment plant at Pierrelatte. Nothing untoward was discovered. The uranium from the Oklo mme was just different from that found anywhere else. Indeed. samples that had been kept from all the shipments dispatched to France since the mine began excavating in I970 all showed slight uranium-235 depletiOn. Out of the 700 tons of uranium already mined, the total 'missing' mass of uranium-235 amounted to 200 kilograms. As the mine site was investigated in greater and greater detail it was soon clear that the missing uranium-235 had been destroyed within the mine seams. One possibility is that some chemical reactiOns had removed it whilst leaving the 238 unscathed. Unfortunately, the rela- tive abundances of uranlUm-235 and 238 are not affected differently by chemical processes that have occurred inside the Earth. Such processes can make some parts of the Earth rich in uranium ore at the expense of others by dlssolvmg It and moving it around, but they don't alter the balance of the two isotopes that make up the dissolved or suspended ore. Only nuclear reactions and decays can do that (see Figure I 1.2). Gradually, the unexpected truth dawned on the investigators. The depleted seams of uranium-235 contamed the distinctive pattern of 30 or more other atomic elements that are formed as by-products of nuclear fission reactions.

Six of these distinctive seams of natural nuclear reactor activity were eventually identified at Oklo. Some of the elements present, like neodymium, have many isotopes but not all are fission prod- ucts. The non-fission products therefore provide a gauge of the abun- dance of all the isotopes before the natural reactions began and so enable us to determine the effects and running-times of those reactions. 7 Remarkably, it appeared that Nature had conspired to produce a natural nuclear reactor which had produced spontaneous nuclear reac- tions below the Earth's surface two billion years ago.slt was this episode in the geological history of Gabon that had led to the accumulation of fissiOn products at the site of the present-day mine. As a result of these sensatiOnal discoveries, mining was stopped for a period in 1972 while a detailed geochemical survey was carried out. Eventually, 15 fossilised ancient reactor sites were found, 14 of them at Oklo and another about 35 km to the south, at Bangombe. In 1956, a Japanese physicist named Paul Kuroda, working at Arkansas University, had predicted that just such a thing might happen"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"236 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e in Nature. 9 Kuroda considered almost all of the key requirements: the concentratIOns of uranium needed for nuclear reactions, the time in the past when it might happen and the uranium-235 to 238 ratio. 1O But nowhere could he think of a site on Earth where all these special conditions could be met at once. But Kuroda missed one interesting possibility that the Oklo geology had created for itselÂ£ The first man-made nuclear reactions were produced on 2 December 1942 as part of the famous Manhattan Project that culmi- nated in the creation of the first atomic bombs. They broke heavy nuclei into lighter ones, releasing energy and fast-movmg neutrons which went on to break up more heavy nuclet and release yet more energy and neutrons. Man-made reactors are controlled by introduc- ing a 'moderator', like graphite or water, which absorbs neutrons and slows the reaction. Neutrons are emitted with high speeds and in that state are readily absorbed by uranium-238 nuclei. They need to be slowed down considerably in order to have a high probability of being absorbed by another uranium-235 nucleus and so sustain the chain of fission reactions. Rods of graphite can be introduced into the mter- action regIOn and retracted when needed to moderate the reactions. Without this moderating effect nuclear reactions would snowball out of control once they have reached a critical level. So what moderated events at Oklo? Investigators found the distinctive 'smoking gun' of fission prod- ucts at Oklo, showing that nuclear chain reactions had taken place. Although today the natural abundance of uranium-235 is only about 0.7 per cent relative to uranium-238, the ratio of the two isotopes has not been constant throughout the history of the Earth. They both decay slowly but at different rates. The half-life of 235 is about 700 million years while that of 238 is about 4.5 billion years. The faster decay of 235 means that there was more 235 relative to 238 in the past than there is today.

The Oklo uranium deposits were first discovered in the 1960s and are several kilometres long and about 700 metres wide. They denve from uranium originally deposited in the Earth's crust during the forma- tion of the Earth. The original abundance was quite small, on average just a few parts in a million of the Earth's make-up. Its source, hke all the other heavy elements in the Earth, lies in the stars. Uranium was formed in the stars and ejected mto space before condensing into small rocks that were aggregated into sohd planets during the early history of the solar system. Following the mtense geological activity associated with the era aftt'r the formation of the Earth, the Oklo natural reac- tors were made possible by the aCCidental deposition of a uranium-rich seam inside a layer of sandstone lying on top of sheets of granite. Over millions of years nearly a kilometre of sandy sediment was washed down on top of the uranium. The granite layers are tilted at about 45 degrees and this led to a build up of rainwater and soluble uranIUm oXide deep underground at the bottom of the slope (see Figure 11.3). The oxidising environment needed to create the water required to concentrate the uranium was brought about by a Significant change in the Earth's biosphere. About two billiOn years ago a change of atmos- phere occurred, brought about by the growth of blue-green algae, the first organisms able to carry out photosynthesis. Their activity increased the oxygen content of the water and allowed some of the uranium to change into soluble OXides. At Oklo, the uranium deposits were buried deep enough to prevent them bemg redissolved and dispersed during nearly two billion years of subsequent history. Only during the last two million years have parts of the ore deposit come dose to the surface where it was found by mmeral prospectors and mined out. This is not the end of the special circumstances needed for a natural reactor. The layer of concentrated uranium ore needs to be thick enough to prevent the neutrons created by the first nudear reactions from simply escaping and it must also be free from contamination by"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"fa , ..

At each site, the characteristic pattern of fission decay products remains to tell the tale. 13 This is remarkable enough, but the insights that followed have made the Oklo reactors an important touchstone for our understanding of the constants of Nature. ALEXANDER SHLYAKHTER'S INSIGHT 'To my mind radio-activity is a real disease of matter. Moreover it is a contagious disease. It spreads. You bring those debased and crumbling atoms near others and those too presently catch the trick of swinging themselves out of coherent existence. It is in matter exactly what the decay of our old culture is in society, a loss of traditions and distinctions and assured reactions.' H G Wells, Tono-Bungay14 Alexander Shlyakhter was a remarkable young nuclear physicist from St Petersburg (Figure 11.4). He died of cancer in June 2000 after moving to Harvard University in the United States.

Whilst still a student he realised that the remnants of"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"240 The Constants of Nature the past Oklo nuclear activity might be telling us something very important about how nuclear reactions operated two billion years ago. He recognised that there was something very unusual about some of the nuclear reactions involved at Oklo. Remarkably, one of the reac- tiOns that occurred there, the capture of a neutron by a samanum- 149 nucleus to produce the samarium- I 50 isotope and a photon of light, is very sensitive. It only occurs because of a fortuitous 'reso- nance': the dramatic increase in the rate of a nuclear reaction in a particular narrow energy range. This occurrence of a resonance is rather like a hole-in-one in golf It happens when the energies of the incom- ing components of a reaction have energies which add up to give a total that is almost exactly equal to the energy state of a possible outcome. In that case the interaction goes through very swiftly into its nicely located final state. It was just the same type of coincidence that Fred Hoyle had predicted should occur in the carbon nucleus which we described in Chapter 8. Shlyakhter realised that the need for a very precisely located reso- nant energy level for the capture of a neutron by samarium- I 49 meant that the Oklo reactor was telling us something very remarkable about the constancy of physics over billions of years. The very finely tuned coincidences that appear to exist between the values of the different constants of Nature which determine the precise energy of this reso- nance level must have been in place to high accuracy about two billiOn years ago when the natural reactor was running. In Figure U.5 we show the probability for the samarium reaction to occur at different temperatures if we shift the present position of the resonance energy. A zero shift means it has the same value as observed in nuclear reactions today. The resonant character of neutron capture by samarium- I 49 is responsible for its very significant depletion at the Oklo site. Three of the four forces of Nature, the strong nuclear interaction, the weak interaction and the electromagnetic interaction, play a role in setting the location of the CruCial resonance energy level.

The various investigators of the samples agree that the temperature must have been somewhere between 200 and 400 degrees centigrade. Now, one can see from the curves drawn for these temperatures that there are actually two ranges of the shift L1 E, that keep the capture cross-section within the allowed bounds: -12 meV > dE, > 20 meV taking the right-hand branch; and -lOS meV > dE, > -89 meV if we take the left-hand branch.

It is also interesting to see the consequences of allowing the elec- tromagnetic and strong nuclear force strengths to vary 10 time simul- taneously. Typically, this leads to limits on the time variation of both 'constants' which are about as strong as those we have just given for the fine structure constant. But there IS a peculiar situation, albeit look- ing rather contrived, in which the limits on variation are far weaker. If, for some unknown reason, the rates of change in the strong and electromagnetic interactions over 2 billion years are equal to within one part in ten million then the effects of the two constant changes cancel.

But without radioactivity we would not be here. The delicate sequence of processes that create the steady flux of solar energy that bathes the Earth is made possible by radioactivity. When the Earth condensed into its present mass of material about four and a half billion years ago it contained enough metals like nickel and iron at its core to sustain a significant magnetic field. Without it, we would have no life-sustaining atmosphere. The wind of electrically-charged par- ticles that are continually blown away from the Sun's surface would have stripped our atmosphere away, just as they have on Mars where there is no magnetic shield. The Earth's magnetic field defends us against these invaders by deflecting them around the atmosphere. Along with this life-sustaining inner core of iron and nickel, the primordial Earth also picked up enough radIOactive elements, like uranium, to maintain a long period of heating by radioactive decays deep inside its interior. This inner engine played a key role in unlock- ing the Earth's geological potential. The subterranean furnace has stim- ulated continual editions of mountain building and plate tectOniCS, keeping the surface alive and changing in a way that provides a suit- able habitat for land animals and amphibians.

Their 'half-lives' tell us the time required to halve their initial abundance. They fall into groups with half- lives that are billions, millions and thousands of years respectively. Followmg the first attempts by Denys Wilkinson 24 to get lunits on the constancy of constants by these means in 1958, Freeman Dyson 25 used the half-life of long-lived beta-decaying nuclei, such as rhenium- I8?, osmium-I8? and potassium-40 to place a limit on possible past variation of the fine structure constant from its present value. These three nuclei have very long half-lives that have been determined accurately by laboratory experiments and by comparison with the ages of meteorites.

The discovery of these possible natural reactor sltes is important not only for studies of the constants of Nature. They tell nuclear physi- cists important things about the future stabilIty and confinability of nuclear fission products buried underground for very long periods of time. Maybe one day a piece of very careful chemical book-keeping will lead to a replay of the exciting sequence of investigations that unmasked the Oklo reactor. If natural reactors can occur on Earth then why not elsewhere? It is tempting to speculate that a new source of lIfe-sustaining heat energy has been identified which might play an unusual role in incu- bating biochemical evolution on other worlds.

Whilst terrestrial astronomers are not unhappy to discover this bias, many others are disappointed to have discovered specialists. They decide that one of the things they could best ask their interstellar corre- spondents about is the values of the constants of Nature. It is not too difficult to make sure we are all talking about the same thing. After all, the radio signals themselves provide an example of shared electro- magnetic experience. It isn't too difficult to tell them what we mean by the fine structure constant. The extraterrestrials are asked to meas- ure the ratios of various frequencies of oscillation in atoms and mole- cules containing specified numbers of particles in and around their nuclei and to send the answers to us at the speed of light. We will do the same and send our answers to them. As this hasn't happened yet I can't tell you what the comparison revealed. But this little fiction illustrates how information gleaned 10 other parts of the Universe could give us a unique check on the unifor- mity of the constants of Nature and the laws of physics.

When we observe a distant star we are not only gathermg information from far away but also reaching back in time. Light travels at a finite speed and so the farther away a star is from us the longer it has taken for its light to reach us.

The expansion of the universe means that distant galaxies are receding from us and so the light waves their stars emit are received by our telescopes with a lower frequency than they are emitted with. This means that their colours are shifted towards the red end of the spectrum, hence they are'redshifted'. Gamow saw how to use the redshift to look back in time to see what the constants of Nature were like when the light began its intergalactic journey to our telescopes. In Figure 12.1, we can see Gamow's telegram to his former student, Ralph Alpher, telling of his new idea and some of its implications. Alas, Gamow's idea turns out to produce no measurable effect even If the fine structure constant varies. But it was not long before three astronomers, John Bahcall, Maarten Schmidt and Wallace Sargent at Cal Tech in Pasadena, hit on another approach that the recent discovery of quasars, or quasi-stellar radiO sources, at high redshifts had made possible for the first time. They had recently found pairs of spectrallines,4 called 'doublets', created by absorption of light received from the newly discovered quasar QSO 3CI91 by the element silicon. The distance between the two lines of the silicon doublet is a small and sensitive feature of atom physICS that is a consequence of the relativistic effects that anse when electrons move close to the speed of light around the atomic nucleus (see Figure 12.2). CruCially, the separation of the lines forming the Silicon doublet depends sensitively on the value of the fine structure constant. The quasar 3CI9I was located at a redshift of 1.95 and so its light left when the Universe was just one-fifth of its present age, nearly I I billion years ago, carrymg encoded information about the value of the fine structure constant at that time.

'I hope 1 shall not shock the experimental physicists too much if 1 add that it is also a good rule not to put over- much confidence in the observational results that are put forward until they have been confirmed by theory.' Arthur Eddington'O The evidence that the fine structure constant may have been different 10 the past is impressive but it is statistical in character. It is based upon the totality of astronomical observations of hght absorption by many different chemical elements in nearly 147 different dust clouds. In the future more data will be added to the total and the question will be probed by better and better observations. Ideally, other astronomers should repeat our observations and use different instruments and differ- ent data analysis techniques to see if they get the same results. Yet, desirable as they are, more observations and greater accuracy are not panaceas. In observational science one must be aware of differ- ent types of uncertainty and 'error'. First, there is uncertainty intro- duced by the limiting accuracy of the measurement process. If your height is being measured to the nearest centimetre and is quoted as be10g 1.85 metres, it could actually lie anywhere between 1.845 and 1.855 metres. ThiS type of uncertamty is usually well understood and can gradually be reduced by improving technology (use a more finely graduated ruler). Second, there is a subtler form of uncertainty, usually called 'systematic error' or 'bias', which skews the data-gathering process so that you unwittingly gather some sorts of evidence more easily than others. More serious still, it may ensure that you are not observ1Og what you thought you were observing. 21"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"264 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e All forms of experimental science are challenged by these subtle biases. In down-to-earth laboratory subjects it 1S usual to repeat exper- iments in several ways, changing certain aspects of the experimental set-up each time, so as to exclude many types of bias. But in astron- omy there is a bit of a problem. There is only one Universe. We are able to observe it but we can't experiment with it. In place of exper- iment we look for correlations between different properties of objects: do all the clouds W1th particular redsh1fts have smaller spectral sh1fts between certain absorption lines, for instance? One might be aware of a bias and yet be unable to correct completely for its influence, as in the case of creating a big catalogue of galax1es where one is aware of the simple fact that bright galaxies are easier to see than faint ones. But the real problem is the bias that you don't know about. The data used to study the possible variation in the fine structure constant has been subjected to a vast amount of test and scrutiny to evaluate the effects of every imaginable bias. So far, only one significant influence has been found and accounting for it actually makes the deduced variations bigger. 22 The reaction of most physicists or chemists to the idea that the fine structure constant might be changing by a tiny amount over billions of years is generally one of horror and outright disbelief The whole of chemistry is founded on the belief in theories which assume that 1t 1S absolutely constant. However, a change of a few parts in a million over 10 billion years would have no discernible effect upon any terres- trial physics or chemistry experiment. To see this more clearly it is time to ask what exactly are the best direct experiment limits that we have on the change 10 the fine structure constant.

This result sounds very strong. It allows the constant to change by only about one part in 10,000 over the whole age of the Universe but the astronomical observations are recording a variation that is about 100 t1mes smaller still. This gap between lab and outer space also illustrates the huge gain in sensitivity that the astronomical observations offer over the direct lab experiments. They may not be making measurements of the fine structure constant at the technolog- ical limit of sensitivity but they are looking so far back into the past - 13 billion years instead of 140 days - that they provide far more sensitive limits. 24 The Universe has to be billions of years old in order that stars have enough time to create the biological elements needed for living complexity to exist within it. If those complicated pieces of chemistry happen to be astrophysicists then it is a nice by-product of the Universe's great age that such sensitive probes of Nature's constancy will be available to them. So it seems that we cannot use terrestrial experiments to double check the apparent changeability of the fine structure constant - we just don't have instruments sens1tlVe enough to pick up a variation at the level seen in the astronomical data. At the moment the best chance of an independent confirmation from a completely different direction would seem to lie with some other astronomical probe.

Are there Just particular epochs in cosmic history when the constants are right for life? There are two situations where it IS possible to examine the changes in traditional constants in some detail.

If constants like G and a do not vary in time, then the standard history of our Universe has a simple broad-brush appearance. During the first 300,000 years the dominant energy in the Universe is radia- tlOn and the temperature is greater than 3000 degrees and too hot for any atoms or molecules to exist. The Universe is a huge soup of elec- trons, photons of ltght and nuclei. We call this the 'radiation era' of the universe. But about 300,000 years there is a big change. The energy of matter catches up with and overtakes that of radiation. The expansion rate of the Universe is now primarily dictated by the denSity of atomic nuclei of hydrogen and helium. Soon the temperature falls off enough for the first simple atoms and molecules to form. Over the next I3 billion years a succession of more complicated structures are formed: galaxies, stars, planets and, eventually, people. This is called the 'matter era' of the Umverse's history. But the matter era might not contmue right up to the present day. If the Universe is expandmg fast enough then, eventually, the matter will not matter, and the expanSlOn just runs away from the decelerating clutches of gravity, like a rocket launched at more than the escape speed from Earth. When this happens we say the Umverse is 'curvature- dominated' because the rapid expansion creates a negative curvature to astronomical space, just like that near the seat of a ridmg saddle. There are three trajectories for an expandmg umverse to follow (see p. I 84). The' closed' umverse expands too slowly to overcome the deceleratmg effects of gravity and eventually it collapses back to high denSity. The 'open' universe has lots more expansion energy than grav- itational deceleration and the expansion runs away forever. The m- between world, that is often called the 'flat' or 'critical' universe, has a perfect balance between expansion energy and gravity and keeps on expanding for ever.

The overall pattern of the expansion history since it was about a second old is shown 10 Figure 12.6. The observations are telling us that about 70 per cent of the energy in the Universe is now in the vacuum form that acts to accelerate the expansion whilst almost all the rest is in the form of matter.

During the radiation era there is no significant change at all.

We know that if the fine structure 'constant' grows too large then atoms and molecules will be unable to exist and no stars will be able to form because their centres will be too cool to initiate self-sustaining nuclear reactions. It is therefore CruClal that the dust era of cosmic history during which the fine structure constant increases does not last too long. Without the vacuum energy or the curvature to stop the steady increase in the fine structure constant's value there would come a tlme when no !tfe is possible. The Universe would cease to be habitable by atom- based forms of life who relied upon stars for energy. Something similar happens if there can be variations in the strength of gravlty, represented by the Newtonian 'constant' G. During the radiation era it tends to stay constant but when the matter era begins it starts to fall in value until the curvature era begins. If the Universe never experiences a curvature era then gravlty just keeps getting weaker and weaker and It becomes harder and harder for planets and stars to exist. The behaviour is shown in Figure 12.8. This overall evolution is very intriguing. It shows that even when the constants are allowed to vary they are only able to explOlt that free- dom to vary when the Universe is in the matter era.

It appears that very small changes to many of our constants would make !lfe impossible. ThIs raIses the deeper question of whether these other worlds 'exist' 10 any sense and, if so, what it is that makes them different from the world we see and know. It also provides an alterna- tive to the old argument that the apparent fine tuning of the world to"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"276 The Constants of Nature possess all those properties required for life IS evidence for some form of special design. For, if all possible alternatives exist, we must neces- sarily find ourselves inhabiting one of those that permits life to exist. And we could go still further and hazard a guess that we might expect to find ourselves in the most probable sort of life-supportmg universe. 3 The first person who seems to have articulated this many-worlds approach was the Cambridge biologist Charles Pantin, who tried to find a more appealing context for thinking about special properties of the Universe's structure, constants and laws by introducmg the notion of an ensemble of many worlds, each with a different suite of physi- cal properties: 'If we could know that our own Universe was only one of an indefinite number with varying properties we could perhaps invoke a solution analogous to the principle of natural selection; that only in certain universes, which happen to include ours, are the conditions suitable for the existence of life, and unless that condition is fulfilled there will be no observers to note the fact.'4 One of the difficulties of even conceiving of such a multiverse of all possible universes is that there are so many things that could be different. From our study of mathematiCs we know that there exist different logics to the one that we use m practice, in which statements are either true or false. Likewise, there are different mathematical struc- tures; different possible laws of Nature; different values for the constants of Nature; different numbers of dimensions of space or of time; differ- ent starting conditiOns for the universe; and different random outcomes to complex sequences of events. On the face of it the collection of all possible worlds would have to include, at the very least, all the poss- ible permutations and combinations of these different things. Gaining an understanding of this cornucopia is a tall order. We have already seen what might happen if some of the other"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"o THE R W 0 R LOS AND BIG QUE 5 TID N 5 277 possible worlds were to be actualised, worlds with more dimensions or other values of crucial constants. However, we don't know whether these different worlds really are possible worlds. It is all very well to contemplate changes in the values of the constants of Nature and the quantities that define the shape and size of the universe. But are they really allowed alternatlve umverses or are they no more possible than square circles? It could be that the all-encompassing Theory of Everything is very restrictive when it comes to giving planning permis- SlOn for other universes. The fact that we can conceive of so many alternative unlverses, defined by other values of the constants of Nature, may be slmply a reflection of our ignorance about the strait-jacket of logical consistency that a Theory of Everything demands. When It comes to contemplating other unlverses there are two ways in which the problem can be approached. There is the conserva- tive approach that produces alternative worlds by making little changes to the propertles of our world - small shlfts in the values of some of the constants of Nature, slightly different propertles of the astro- nOmical Universe, perhaps, but no changes to the laws of Nature them- selves. Typically, these studies show that if the 'little changes' are too large there are adverse consequences for the eXlstence of life as we know it. Our sort of life could still exist if there was a one part in a hundred billion change m the value of the fine structure constant, we thmk} but not If It was a one part in ten change. By contrast, the radical approach thinks about big changes, where thmgs like the laws, the underlying mathematical logic, or the number of dimensions of space and time can be changed. It has to conceive of completely new types of 'life' which could exist in entirely different environments. 6 This provokes a closer examination of what is meant by 'life' . Typically, it is reduced to some bare essentials, like the ability to process and store information (If you are a computer scientist), the facIlity to evolve by natural selection (If you are a biologist), or simply non-equilibrium energy flow (if you are a chemist)' As an example of the radical approach, consider the search for"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"278 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e 'life' in mathematical formalisms that I once proposed.? We consider the hierarchy of all possible mathematical structures, startmg with simple finite collections of points related by rules, then geometries, then counting systems like the arithmetic of whole numbers, then fractions, then decimals, then complex structures and groups and so on, onwards and upwards forever, on an ascendmg staircase of complex- Ity. Now we ask which of these structures can fully describe conscious beings. For if we were to take the axioms of one of these systems of logic, and then gradually work out all the truths that can be deduced from them, using the prescribed rules of deduction, we would see a great web of logical truths stretching out before us. If that web of truth eventually leads to structures that completely descnbe what we call 'consciousness' then they could be said to 'be alive' in some sense. The question is: in what sense? Another way to look at thIS is to think about the creation of a computer model, or simulation, of the process by which stars and plan- ets form. This IS something that astronomers work hard to do. Star formatIon is too complicated to understand m full detaIl just by using pencil and paper and dIrect human calculatlOn. Fast computer solution of the equations that govern it is needed.

An enthusiastic biochemist suggests that we go a bit further and feed into the computer lots of informatIon about blOchemistry and geol- ogy so that we can follow the computer's predictions about the early chemical evolution of a planet and its atmosphere. When thiS is done the results are very interesting. The computer describes the formation of self-rephcating molecules that start to compete with each other and do complicated things on the young planet's surface.

The computer programme is run for longer and longer. Eventually, some of the structures in the programme seem to be signalling to one another and storing information. They have devel- oped a simple code and what we would call an arithmetic, that is based upon the symmetry (eight-sided) that the biggest replicators possess. The programmers are fascinated by thiS behaviour, never suspecting that it could emerge from their original programming. The behaviour of the replicators IS like a code and at first it is not too difficult to break. The patterns in the computer output are developing a simple logic for communication. A video display of the output makes It all seem like a natural history film about the evolution of life. This little fantasy shows how it is conceivable that behaviour we might judge to be conscious could emerge from a computer simula- tIOn. But If we ask where thiS conscious behaviour 'is' we seem to be pushed towards saying that it lives in the program. It is part of the software running in the machine. It consists of a collectlOn of very complex deductions ('theorems') that follow from the starting rules that define the logic of the programming. This life' exists' in the math- ematical formalism. These examples seek to capture one aspect of life as a computer programme. They are suspiciously powerful because they lead to the conclUSIOn that If 'life', suitably defined, can exist in a mathematical formalism then it does exist in the fullest sense. s This is not unlike Anselm's famous ontological argument for the necessary existence of God. The problem with such computer ontologICal arguments that allow life to be placed within mathematical formalisms is that they equate mathematical existence with physical existence. Physical existence is something that we have some experience of. We probably can't define it but, like many thmgs that we have difficulty defining, we know It when we see it. Mathematical eXistence IS a far weaker thing, but much easier to define.

Thus right-angled triangles 'exist' in the system of Euclid's geometry. Square circles don't. A true mathematical statement doesn't have to be interesting; it doesn't have to be short; it doesn't have to be new. It just must not lead to a logical contradiction with the logical rules being used. 9 These mathematical universes can be imaginary in many senses. A few, like the mathematician Godfrey Hardy (1877-1947), have thought that some of them are more appealing than the actual: \"'Imaginary\" universes are so much more beautiful than this stupidly constructed \"real\" one; [but] most of the finest products of an applied mathematician's fancy must be rejected, as soon as they have been created, for the brutal and sufficient reason that they do not fit the facts.'10 A possible objection to obtaining life-supporting worlds as outputs from some great computer code is that there seem to be so many more mathematical formalIsms that don't lead to life than those that do. But that's all right. Our anthropic argument has taught us that we must find ourselves in one of those that does support life. However, there is a more subtle problem. There are also an infinite number of universes that possess the lawful ordered structure that we see around us up untIl the present moment, but which will behave in a completely dIfferent or lawless fashion from now onwards. It there- fore seems far more likely that we will live in a universe where our belief that the Sun will me tomorrow fails.

These other worlds are rather Platonic. Their existence does not smack of what we hke to think of as 'real' existence. It's Virtual rather than real. Somehow life in a mathematical formalism or within a com- puter program isn't really living. But maybe all conscious information- processors m these formalisms suffer from similar delusions of grandeur and uniqueness. But let's suppose they are right and move on to some more concrete ensembles of other worlds. THE GREAT UNIVERSAL CATALOGUE 'The universe is merely a fleeting idea in God's mind - a pretty uncomfortable thought, particularly if you've just made a down payment on a house.' Woody Allen '2 Cosmologists have considered ways in which some of the ensembles of other worlds might arise. Generally, they spring from the conservative approach to creating other worlds that we introduced above. We consider a small number of changes to the Universe we know, leaving the laws unchanged but altering the values of its constants or its dimensions. We have already seen the case of the inflationary universe in its chaotic and eternal editions. Different large regions of our smgle Universe, which may be infinite in size, can find themselves with different average densi- ties, different expansion rates, or even different numbers of large dimen- sions of space and different forces of Nature, as a result of the randomness intrinsic to the processes that initiate inflation. Inflation may have begun and ended at different times in different places. The result would be a universe containing different regions where conditions"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"282 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e were very cL.fferent and the values of some of the defining constants that are essential for life could take different values (see Figure B.la, b). These regions are most likely to be very large, much larger than our visible Universe. Inflation very easily expands small regions to large ones and so the boundary of our domain is most likely to be vastly larger than what we can see of the Universe. But one day our descen- dants might see the evidence of one of these regions where things are different coming over the astronomical horizon, annihilating distant matter, distortmg the expansion of the Universe, and swallowing up stars and galaxies. If the eternal edition of inflation is contemplated then the ensemble of possibihties expands even more, and we have to see ourselves as a local fluctuation m a never-endmg process which explores all of the permutatlOns of cosmic conditions, constants and dimensions that are open to it. Only m some will life be possible. An interesting feature of these inflationary ensembles is that they do not ask us to believe in some multiverse of other worlds of dubi- ous status. They are not parallel worlds or imagmary worlds, and may not even be merely hypothetical worlds. What counts as a 'world' is just a very large region of our one and only Universe. And if our Universe is infinite in extent then the number of alternatives that mfla- tion can generate may be infinite as well. If it exhausts all the logical possibilities for vanation that are available to it then any pOSSibility that can exist will exist somewhere, not just once, but infinitely often. One thing we can say With certamty about thiS idea is that if it is true it cannot be original. 13 There are other more mundane ways of producmg large numbers of different possibilities within our single Universe. Nature creates complexity by breaking the symmetries of the laws of Nature in the outcomes of those laws.

In some places it will break in one way, elsewhere in another. These random outcomes can have far-reachmg consequences for the evolution of hfe in the future. A typical example of vital symme- try breaking is that which gives rise to the balance between matter and antimatter in the early UnIverse. As a result, the 1mbalance between matter and radiation that is needed to prevent everythmg bemg anni- hilated to radiatlon later will vary from place to place. If it were to happen before inflation occurs then a region that had a preponderance of matter would mflate and become a huge region containIng our ViSl- ble UnIverse. If it occurred after inflation then our visible portlon of the Universe could contam regiOns with dlfferent balances of matter and antimatter. Again, we have a vehlcle for creating large regions within a single Universe where some features whlch are critical for the exis- tence of life can vary signIficantly from place to place. The quantum descriptiOn of the UnIverse teaches us that all the substantive things that we see and experience as particles or aggregates of matter have a wavelike qUallty. That quality expresses the probabll- ity that we will observe them to have certain properties. One of the interesting discoveries made by phYS1C1StS wrestling wlth the problem of creating a quantum description of the entire UnIverse is that the starting condltions for the Universe seem to playa crucial role in the transition from wavy to substantive properties. We are used to the idea that the wavy indefinite nature of par- ticles of matter lS somethmg that occurs in the realm of the very small. When things become large this quantum wavmess becomes small and negligible. We might have to worry about it when we do atomic physics but we don't need to when we are driving a car. However, lt appears that this substantive quality of our expenence - that there is definite non-quantum behaviour of thmgs - is not guaranteed in all universes that become big and old. Special starting conditions seem to be needed for this to happen.

The modern search for a Theory of Everything offers scope for other worlds as well. It is often imagined that the ultimate Theory of Everything will specify all the constants of Nature, but this now looks far less likely. It appears that only a fraction of the constants of Nature will be fixed absolutely by the inflexible internal logic of the theory while the others will be free to take different values that are chosen by a haphazard, symmetry-breaking process. As we saw in Chapter 8, faced with thiS openness, we have to turn to anthropic selection to explain why we see the values in the narrow life-supporting ranges that we do. So far we have been content to create ensembles of other worlds by tinkering with parts of our world and explOiting its natural propen- sity to make things fall out differently from place to place. It is time to be more speculative and to consider some of the ways in which the constants of Nature could be made to change and fill out the collec- tion of all possibilities by stepping outside the constraints of main- stream theories of phySiCS into the realm of more speculative possibilities. WORLDS WITHOUT END 'Universes that drift like bubbles in the foam upon the River of Time.' Arthur C Clarke\" Before the self-reproducing character of the eternal inflationary Universe 15 came to light it was suggested that it might be possible to initiate inflation in one part of the Universe by arranging particular high-energy collisions between elementary partides. 16 The eternal infla- tionary scenario is actually based upon the expectation that no arrang- ing is really necessary. The Universe brmgs about the continual bouts of inflation without intelligent help or unintelligent mishap."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"286 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e Now what if the Universe is eternally reinventing itself in bouts of inflation? Perhaps there have been super-advanced civilisatiOns in regions that inflated in the past who did know how to mitiate inflation and tailor its consequences. If so. they might be able to tune the outcomes of inflation to be advantageous for the continued existence of lIfe. The British cosmologist Edward Harrison has speculated l ? that we could imagine such enlightened beings would choose to make the properties of the next edition of the Universe better suited for life than those within the one in which they had themselves evolved. If this tuning process continued over many generations of eternal mflation then we would expect the life-supportmg 'coincidences' between the values of the controllable constants of Nature to become increasingly fine-tuned. Perhaps, Harrison suggests. this is why we find them so to be. Appealmg as this intelligent design of universes might appear to be, it IS not clear how it gets started. If universes begin with constants far from the values that allow complexity to develop. they will never develop the conscious beings needed to fine tune the constants. They will have to rely on random fluctuatiOns to deliver a universe able to evolve beings intelligent enough to fine tune its constants. Another interesting scheme which also sees the constants of Nature evolving under some external influence has been suggested by the American physicist Lee Smolin. IS He suggests that every tllne a black hole forms 10 the Universe there 1S scope for a new parallel universe to emerge out of the mysterious singularity that develops at its centre. Everything that 1S captured by a black hole ends by falling inexorably into this singularity at its centre. Instead of disappearmg into timeless oblivion the disappearing material is reborn as a new expandmg universe with the values of its constants of Nature slightly shifted in a random way.19 In the long run this scenario leads to definite expectations. If the collapse of matter into black holes always spawns new universes then the more black holes a universe can produce the more offsprmg 1t w1ll have to carry forward information about 1ts own 'genetic code' - the values of its defining constants of Nature. Eventually. it is argued, we"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"o THE R W 0 R LOS AND BIG QUE 5 T ION 5 287 would expect to find ourselves hvmg in a universe in which the constants have evolved towards a suite of values which maximise the production of black holes. Any little change 10 the values of the constants we observe should therefore make it harder to produce black holes. This is just one of the conclusions that could be drawn from this scenario, though. From our anthropic considerations we can see that it might turn out to be the case that universes with constants taking values which maximise the production of black holes are unable to contain hvmg observers at all. An application of the Anthropic Prmciple 1S therefore essent1al. We can predict only that we should find ourselves in a universe w1th constants whose values max1mise the productlOn of black holes, given that living observers must also be possible. And that may be a very different sort of universe. Another long-term possibility is that there are no local maxima for the production of black holes when the constants are changed in value. There may be a d1rection of change for some constants which allow the black hole production to keep on gettmg bigger and bigger forever. Again, we can then say rather little about the ult1mate values of the constants of Nature. 2o Th1s suggests another way 10 which an ensemble of other worlds with different constants can be generated from our Universe. If a universe con tams sufficient matter to contract back upon 1tself and experience a Big Crunch in the future then 1t 1S a mystery what occurs at the Crunch. Physically, 1t is not very d1fferent from the centre of a black hole. Maybe the universe, along with space and time and the laws of Nature, just comes to an end and nothing follows. But cosmol- OglStS have always been tempted to think that the collapsing universe might 'bounce', phoenix-like, back into a state of expansion. If so, the natural conclusion to draw is that the universe will go on oscillating between states of expanSlOn and contraction forever, as 10 Figure 13.2. The big question is what, if anything, changes when a bounce occurs? Is the sheet wiped clean or does some information about the old cycle get carried into the new one?"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"288 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e size . . .. time Figure 13.2 An oscillating universe in which collapse to a future Big Crunch is suaeeded by re-expansion into a new cycle, and so on for ever. It could be, as John Wheeler originally suggested, that there is a reshuffling of the values of the constants of Nature each time a bounce occurs. 21 This will create a never-ending sequence of expand- ing and contracting unrverses 10 which the constants are differen~. Only in those cycles in which the 'deal' of the constants comes out in a permutation that allows life to exist could we eXIst. Unfortunately, we have no idea how to link the values of constants in one cycle to those in the next. When it comes to the properties of the universe as a whole, there is one big factor that WIll playa dom1Oant role. If the constants are changed into a permutation that does not allow the universe to collapse again to a Big Crunch the game will be over and the universe will be left stuck with a hand of constants that are never again re-dealt. Clearly, this IS the most lrkely state for the universe to find itself in. If there have been an infinite number of oscillations of the universe 10 the past and there is any chance of a permutation being found which ends the osCIllatiOns then, eventually, that permu- tation will be realised and the oscillations will end. 22 There IS a favourite piece of continuity that cosmologists like to impose on the cycle-to-cycle evolution.

If we were to make contact with an intelligence elsewhere in the Universe we would look first to the constants of Nature for common ground. We would talk first about those things that the constants of Nature define. The probes that we have dispatched into outer space carrying information about ourselves and our location in the Universe pick on the wavelengths of light that define the hydro- gen atom to tell where we are and what we know. The constants of Nature are potentially the greatest shared physical experience of intel- ligent beings everywhere in the Universe. Yet, as we have followed the highways and by-ways of the quest to unravel their meaning and signif- icance, we have come full circle. Their architects saw them as a means of lifting our understanding of the Universe clear from the anthropo- morphisms of human construction to reveal the otherness of a Universe not designed for our convenience. But these universal constants, created by the coming together of relativistic and quantum realities, have turned out to underwrite our very existence in ways that are at once mysten- ous and marvellous. For it is their values, measured with ever greater preCisiOn in our laboratones, but still unexplained by our theories, that make the Universe a habitable place for minds of any sort. And it is through their values that the uniqueness of our Universe is impressed upon us by the ease with which we can think of less satisfactory alternatives. Will we ever explain the values of all the constants of Nature? So far, the answer is unclear, but in suggestive ways. Our deepest theo- ries of the forces and patterns of Nature suggest that a Theory of Everything will have an openness about it. Not everything will be pinned down by the dead hand of logical consistency.

Stoney's prediction of a basic electric charge does not seem to have attracted the degree of attention it deserved. This is clear from the fact that in October 1894 he can be found writing a letter to the editors of the Philosophical Magazine, a leading scientific journal of the day, complaimng that Ebert, a recent author in the magazine, had stated that 'Von Helmholtz ... was the first to show that ... there must ... be a minimum quantity of electricity ... which like an electrical atom IS no longer divisible: Stoney draws attention to his prior lecture and articles of 20 years earlier, see Philosophical Magazine senes 5, 38, 4 I 8 (1894) which can be viewed at http://dbhs.wvusd.kI2.ca.us/ Chern-History / Stoney- I 894.htrnl. 34.

These quantities are defined in an Identical discussion which appears in his papers of 1899 and 1900 and were publicised in a series of lectures delivered m Berlm in 1906/7. These lectures were later published as Theorie tier Warmestrahlung, where the same discussion of natural units ('Natiirliche Masseinheiten') appears agam. 44. Planck used different symbols for these constants: with f for our G, b for our h, and a for our k. We have used the modern symbols. The symbol G appears to have been introduced for the gravita- tion constant by A. Konig and F. Recharz, 'Eine neue Methode zur Bestimmung der Gravitationsconstante', Ann. Physik. Chern. 24, 664-8 (1885). 45. Boltzmann's constant IS not ttuly fundamental like G, h, and c. It is just a factor to convert energy units into temperature units. 46. The reason for the co-existence of Stoney and Planck natural units of mass, length and time, each differing in value by a small factor is that the combination e 2 /hc is a dimensionless constant of Nature roughly equal to 1/860 using currently determmed values of the constants. Therefore, if e 2 is just replaced by hc in Stoney's units of mass, length and time we get Planck's units up to a numerical factor given by the square root of 860.

A few years later Drude supports a choice that is really the same as Planck's. He uses c, G and the two radiation constants that define black body radiation. These are reducible to k, Boltzmann's constant and h, Planck's constant; see P. Drude, The Theory oj Optics, Longmans, Green, New York, 1902, p. 527, where he references Planck's discus- sion of 1899. He says that 'The absolute system is then obtained from the assumption that the constant of gravitation, the velOCity of light, and the two constants ... m the law of radiation all have the value Z: so. According to Focken, writing 1953, Eddington claimed that the Planck length must be the key to some essential structure because it is so much smaller than the radii of the proton and electron.

He seemed to take no interest in the weak force of radioactivity and the strong nuclear forces. It could be said that his programme for unification was only playing with half the pieces of the puzzle. In 1980 I mentioned this to the mathematical phYSiCiSt Abraham Taub in Berkeley because Taub had worked closely with John von Neumann at Princeton and had had contact With Einstein there as well. He told me that he once heard this objection put to Einstein who said that he believed that ultimately the weak and strong forces would be shown just to be aspects of the electromagnetic force. This was a presClent comment Since we believe that the electro- magnetic and weak forces are unified in the well-tested Weinberg- Salam theory, while theories which add the strong force also exist but await decisive observation test. 6. Einstein liked to evaluate entire theories by the 'strength' of their equations (see for example the 5th edition of his book The Meaning oj Relativity, Methuen, London, 1955). This is just the number of pieces of information that can be freely and independently inputted into the equations, what mathematicians called the 'initial data'. Einstein extended this measure of a theory's tightness to the constants of Nature defining its solutions as well. 7. 1.

The most distant stars are not perfectly at rest with respect to us in this sense but their motions are imperceptibly small. One of the achievements of Einstein's theory of gravity and motion, which superseded Newton's, was to do away with this imaginary background of 'absolute space'. Newton himself was criticised by philosophers like Bishop Berkeley for mtroducmg such a concept. Newton was aware of its weaknesses but recognised its usefulness in expressing a theory of motion that was extremely accurate in describing local motions. 25.

The speed of light was first bn1l1antly deduced by the Danish astronomer Olaf Roemer m 1676. He noticed that the intervals of time that passed between the eclipses of one of Jupiter's moons lengthened when the Earth was moving away from Jupiter but shortened when it approached Jupiter. He found an average time difference of 996 seconds between eclipses from many obser- vations made over the course of a year. Roemer then attributed this time difference to the fact that light had a finite speed. Thus, he argued, it must require 996 seconds for hght to cross a distance equal to the diameter of the Earth's orbit. This distance was accurately known, even then, and allowed him to obtam a very good estlmate of the speed of light. 8. Gamow, Mr. Tompkins in Paperback, p. 1. 9.

Then this number is not divisible by any of your assumed finite list of primes because there is always a remainder of I. Therefore either this number is a prime or it is divisible by a pnme that IS bigger than the last one in your original list. Either way, this contradicts the original assumption that the list of primes was finite. Hence the number of prime numbers cannot be finite. 22.

Paul Dirac was interested in this possibility and it was considered by Heisenberg who mentions his disenchantment with it in a letter to Dirac a few years later, writing on 27 March 1935 that 'I don't beheve at all any more in your conjecture that the Sommerfeld fine structure constant may have something to do with the concept of tempera- ture ...

This will be the case If the acceleration is caused by the presence of the so-called 'cosmological constant', which represents the vacuum energy of the Universe. It is possible that other forms of matter can mimic a cosmological constant's presence for a finite period of cosmic history before decaying into ordinary forms of matter which do not produce accelerated expansion (see J.D. Barrow, R. Bean, and J. Magueijo, Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 3 I 6, L41-4 (2000)). If thiS happens early enough then information processing need not eventually die out. 40. One loophole that might be exploitable in the right type of universe is the possibility that the acceleration is produced by the presence of a new form of matter which might be used as a new form of energy source. ThiS would probably only result in the production of usable energy plus another accelerating constant energy source which could not be mined for energy. Eventually that new source would come to drive the expansion and unstop- pable informatlOn degradation would commence again. 4 I. Barrow and Tipler, op. cit., p. 668.

This acceleration may be contributed by a positive cosmological constant, proposed first by Einstein in his onginal announcement of the general theory of relativity. It is like an additional part to the law of gravity. Unlike the familiar inverse-square law of Newton, this contribution increases linearly with distance.

We might hope to understand why our final theory cannot be changed in any small way without destroying its logical self-consistency, but it is hard to imagine how we could ever know that there was not a completely different self-consistent theory that was not in any sense close to our purported final theory. 4. At first sight it might appear that this endpoint is similar to that of biology prior to the discovery of evolution by natural selec- tion. However, it is rather different. It is about the discovery of a complete form for the laws and true constants of Nature. But even if we knew them we could not predict all the states that could emerge from them. 5. This does not mean that the entire Universe has to be as it is in every respect. Two universes with the same laws and constants of Nature, and even the same mitial conditions, will display differ- ent outcomes to those laws and different detailed evolution because of symmetry breaking and quantum uncertainty. 6.

The gravitational force between two point masses is proportional to r- 2 , where r is their separation in space. 5. This is also true for electrical or magnetic forces. 6. To see this, consider a mass located at a point. Now surround it by a sphencal surface. The lines of force attracting towards the mass point In all dnnensions intersect every point on the spherical surface. It is the area of thiS surface that tells us what the inverse- power of distance is that the force obeys. In three-dimenSIOnal space the spherical surface is two-dimensional and has an area proportional to the square of its radius. Likewise, in N-dimen- sional space the sphere has a surface area threaded by the force lines that IS proportional to its radius to the (N-I)st power. 7. Portrait of Immanuel Kant.

Imagine viewing triangles, lines and geometncal relations on a flat surface using a curved mirror. The Euclidean geometry will be distorted into that of a curved surface. But there wlll still be a one-to-one correspondence between the rules governing flat geom- etry and those in the distorted space, guaranteed by the laws of light reflection. 10.

Gauss imagined two-dimenslonal creatures, that he called 'bookworms', that lived on mfinite sheets of paper. Helmholtz (1881) put the book- worms on the surface of a ball, thus giving them a world that was finite m extent but without any boundanes. 12.

Einstein's theories of gravity and motion have shown us the consequences of this link. As a result physicists now speak of 4-dimensional space-time rather than of space and time. This synthesis was first introduced by Hermann Minkowski in a lecture entitled 'Space and Time' to scientists in Cologne on 21 September 1908. He began with the announcement, 'Gentlemen! The views of space and time which 1 wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and t1me by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve independence: They imagine space-time like a 4-dimensional block that can be sliced up in many possible ways, each of them equivalent to a different way of defining 'time'. This lmage of block space-time is an old one smce it arises rather naturally from a God's-eye view of the world. Back in the thirteenth century, Thomas Aquinas wrote that 'We may fancy that God knows the flight of time in His eter- mty, in the way that a person standing on top of a watchtower embraces in a single glance a whole caravan of passing travellers: 1: Aquinas, Compendium Tbeologiae, quoted in P. Nahin, Time Machines, AlP Press, New York, 1993, p. 103. The term 'block universe' was mtroduced by the Oxford philosopher Francis Bradley in his book Principles oj Logic (1883), written many years before Minkowski's introduction of the mathematical description of space-time and the Wellsian fantasy of time travel. He writes: 'We seem to think that we sit in a boat, and are carried down the stream of time, and that on the bank there 1S a row of houses with numbers on the doors. And we get out of the boat, and knock at the door of number 19, and, re-entering the boat, then suddenly find ourselves opposite 20, and, having then done the"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"330 The Con 5 tan t 5 0 f Nat u r e same, we go on to 21. And, all this while, the firm fixed row of the past and future stretches in a block behind us, and before us: Einstein also seems to have held this view, in which the future IS laid out ready-made before us and any differences between the past, the present and the future are mere illuslOns. Writing to the family of his oldest and closest friend, Michele Besso, a few weeks after Besso's death in 1955, Einstein pointed to the illusory nature of the past and the future, knowing that there would be no recov- ery from his own illness: 'And now he has preceded me briefly in bIdding farewell to this strange world.

This analysis was performed by mass spectrometry. Molecules of uranium hexafluoride gas are ionised and accelerated before being deflected ~hen they pass through a magnetic field. The mass of the molecule is revealed by the magnitude of the deflection. The accuracy of this technique is very high. It was standard for the 'normal' natural abundance of uranium to be proscribed by 0.7202 + 0.0006 per cent of uranium-235, whereas the samples analysed from Oklo showed 0.7171 + 0.0007 per cent. 5. Isotopes are forms of the same element for which the nucleus contains the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. The simplest example is that of hydrogen whose nucleus contains only one proton and no neutrons. Deuterium, the small- est isotope of hydrogen, contains one neutron and one proton. 6. The standard value is 0.007202 + 0.00006. 7. Seven isotopes of neodymium are found. One of these, neodymium- I 42, is not a fission product and can be used to determine the abundances of the natural neodymium components at the Oklo site before they were affected by the running of the reactor. 8.

The measurement of the reqUired spectral lines in the laboratory at the required level of accuracy (for which there appears to have been no need before) is very challenging and with more labora- tory observations the MM method could extract even more information from the available data. 17.

There are other forms of error which are introduced deliberately, especially by politicians, when treating voting data. For example, a party with a ten-point manifesto assumes without question that if they win the electIon by an overall majority then they have a mandate for all their manifesto policies whereas they mIght in reality only have a majority vote for a fraction of them. 22. This IS the effect of refraction of the incoming light which depends upon the depth of atmosphere it has to traverse which depends on the geographical latitude of the telescope. It is a very small effect, usually ignorable in astronomy, but it enters at the same level as the apparent fine structure variations. If corrected for, it makes the value of the fine structure constant slightly smaller still in the past when compared with its value today. 23. J.D. Prestage, R.L. Tjoelker and L. Maleki, Phys. Rev.

The current experimental resolution of this technology is sensitive to shifts in a of about I ~ over 1-2 hours. In the fUture it may be adapted to test the constancy of a.

Every attempt to define probability for cosmo- logical problems precisely and so give numerical answers to questions like 'what is the probability that the universe has certain"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"NOTES 339 properties which will allow life to exist in it?' has so far failed. Technically, this is the mathematical problem of defining a proba- bility measure. The difficulty is simply not knowmg what are the equally likely outcomes when it comes to assessing the collection of all possible starting conditions for the universe or all possible outcomes from the chaotic inflationary universe theory. The problems are exacerbated by the problem of defining 'when' the probabilities apply in a way that is universal for every place in the un1verse. There is considerable research into this problem at present but it remains unsolved. 4. C. Pantin, 'Life and the Conditions of Existence', op. cit. p. 104. Note that although Pantin mentions 'a solution analogous to the principle of natural selectlOn' he does not develop 1t. S. We could be wrong about this if the Theory of Everything contained some inter-linkage of constants that had the property that a change of a part m a hundred billion in the fine structure constant produced a change of, say, one part in two of some other life-crit1cal constant. 6. If life is nothing more than a by-product of a very high level of complex1ty being attained, then maybe there can be life in veloc- ity space or in the fabric of space-time structure or down on the atomic, nuclear or elementary particles scales as an asymptotic extension of present quests to create nanotechnologies. 7. J.D. Barrow, Pi in the Sky, Oxford University Press, Oxford and Vintage, New York, 1992, pp. 280-92. For a development see also M. Tegmark, 'Is the \"Theory of Everything\" merely the Ult1mate Ensemble Theory?', Annals oj Physics (NY) 270, I (1998). 8. We could ask if there 1S some threshold in complexity at wh1ch it becomes possible for life to be described within a mathematical formalism. The only noticeable threshold occurs when we reach the complexity of arithmetic. At this point self-reference is possible. There can be a one-to-one correspondence between anthmet1c and statements about arithmetic (this is not possible with simpler"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"340 The Constants of Nature structures like geometries). Cellular automata like John Conway's game of life turn out to be equivalent to arithmetic in their logical structure. It is mteresting that when we attain the complexity of arithmetic the property of G6del incompleteness becomes a property of the system. Some wnters, notably John Lucas and Roger Penrose, have suggested that this property might be an essential feature of consciousness. If so, then the complexity threshold that is passed when we reach arithmetic would be the minimum level needed for conscious information processing to arise within the logical system. It is interesting to compare this low threshold for self-referential complexity in logical systems with the low threshold for generating complexity in discrete cellular automata discussed by Stephen Wolfram in A New Kind oj Science, Wolfram Media Inc., Champaign, IL, 2002. Simple one-dimensiOnal algorithms with nearest-neighbour rules can generate levels of complexity that are unsurpassed by adding extra dimensions, more complex rules, random perturbations or averaging. 9. If any false statement is present in a logical system it can be used to prove the truth of any statement (like 0 = I). Famously, Bertrand Russell responded to a challenge to show that his questioner was the Pope if I = 2: you and the Pope are two but if two equals one then you and the Pope are one. 10. G.H.

If we forget about inflation as a creator of diversity and just suppose that the Universe is infinite and random then somewhere, infinitely often, there must arise large regions which have hfe- supporting properties.

This idea that the constants of Nature are 'reprocessed' when matter collapses into a singularity of infinite density, for exam- ple when a dosed universe collapses and bounces back into a state of expansion, was first suggested by John A. Wheeler; see for example the last chapter of C. Misner, K. Thorne and J.A. Wheeler, Gravitation, WH. Freeman, San Francisco, 1972. 20. This is rather like the rat-race long-term state for an evolution- ary system, whereas the situation where a local maximum is achieved with respect to the value of the constants is like the attainment of an evolutionarily stable strategy, in which any devi- ation from thiS state leaves at least one of the players worse off; see for example J. Maynard Smith, Evolutionary Genetics, Oxford University Press, London, 1989. 21. Clearly, this scenario requires the universe to be dosed so that it can collapse in the future. 22.
