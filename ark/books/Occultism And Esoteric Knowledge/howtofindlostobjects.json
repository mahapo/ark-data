A Method That Works"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"This Book’s For You You’ve lost your car keys, and are about to lose your mind. You’ve looked everywhere—have torn your house apart—but can’t find those keys. Your day has ground to a halt. Your life is on hold. A glazed look has come into your eye. You’re going nuts! All because of a missing set of keys. You begin another search. Like a wild man, you rummage through room after room. Half an hour later, they still haven’t turned up. You throw your­ self on the sofa and groan: “This is ridiculous!” Finally, you check your pocket. For the keys? No, for the bus fare you’re going to need to get to work. It’s come to that. Talk about feeling foolish. Me anwhile, your neighbor has mislaid his check­ book. Less than a minute later, he has found it, and is coolly walking out his front door. How did he do it? How did he avoid the frustra­ tion—th e inconvenience—the loss of time—so often caused by misplaced objects? Let’s ask him. “Sir, how did you find that elusive checkbook?” “Why, simple,” he replies with a modest smile. “By applying the Twelve Principles.” “The Twelve Principles?” “That’s right. As outlined in H OW TO F IND L OST O BJECTS by Professor Solomon.” And he continues on his way—while you are about to resume the frantic hunt for your keys. But...maybe it’s time that you, too, checked out those Twelve Principles. Maybe you’re ready, after all these years, to become a Finder, not a Loser. If you think you might be—if you’re seriously inter­ ested in locating what you lose —this book’s for you. 3 4 "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Yes, lost objects can be found. How is it done? The Facts Young and old, rich and poor, city folks and farm­ ers—we’re all constantly losing things. It’s an age­old problem—as old as the pyramids. And one that’s not about to go away. Every day millions of objects are misplaced in the United States. Among them are wallets, rings, keys, scissors, sweaters, notebooks, eyeglasses, theatre tickets, important documents—you name it. (A circus elephant is said to have been lost recently in Flo rida!) Many of these objects are never recovered —possibly a billion dollars’ worth annually. (Their sentimental value, of course, is incalculable.) Even more disturbing is the time spent looking for such objects. The average person could spend up to two months of his life searching—often fruitlessly—for things he has lost. Then there’s the “nuisance factor” associated with missing objects. The cars that can’t be started. The books that can’t be read. The business that can’t be conducte d. M illio ns of Am eric ans experience such frustrations daily. It is something that touches each of our lives, and that can make a nightmare of an ordinary day—that can drive us to distraction! But the incredible fact is this: Each and every one of those objects—the tickets, the eyeglasses, the elephant—could have been found. Easily. Within minutes. 5 By following my method. Interested? Read on. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Getting Started My method is unique, amazing, and easy to learn. It is based on what I call the Twelve Principles—a set of precepts designed to lead you directly to any lost object. Like a bloodhound! I discovered these principles after years of bitter experience. For I, too, was once a Loser and a Weeper. I, too, was constantly being mocked by misplaced keys, books, manuscripts, pajama tops. My cap would vanish. My pen would hide from me. The list was endless. But then I realized that lost objects can be found. If the search is conducted systematically, and mind­ ful of a few basic ideas. It wasn’t long before I was finding my things with an ease that seemed miraculous. Yet no psychic powers, expensive equipment, or special skills were involved. Simply a method. I also began to help frien ds find their lost items. Astounded at the re sults, they urged me to write this book. You’ll be astounded, too, as missing objects virtu­ ally line up to be found! I recommend that you start by reading the book through from beginning to end. Introduce yourself to the P rin ciples. Follow Betsy as she searches for her keys—the wrong way and the right way. Get a feel for my tips and techniques. And mark any sec­ 7 tions that seem particularly relevant to your own misplacement profile. Then, the next time you lose something, open this book and make the Twelve Principles work for you. I can almost guarantee they will. Are you ready? Let’s learn how to find lost objects. On to the Principles. 8 "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Twelve Principles My method is based on the Twelve Principles—a set of fundamental guidelines for finding lost objects. The Twelve Principles are: 2. The Principles 1. Don’t Look for It 2. It’s Not Lost— You Are 3. Remember the Three C’s 4. It’s Where It’s Supposed to Be 5. Domestic Drift 6. You’re Looking Right at It 7. The Camouflage Effect 8. Think Back 9. Look Once, Look Well 10. The Eureka Zone 11. Tail Thyself 12. It Wasn’t You The se Principles are the core of my method. So get acquainted with them. Learn them. Master them. Th en, wh enev er something c an’ t be found, simply apply the Principles. So...let’s get right into them. 10 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLE ONE Don’t Look for It Something’s lost, and your first thought—your basic instinct—is to look for it. You’re ready to start rum­ maging about. To hunt for it in a random, and increasingly frenetic, fashion. To ransack your own house. This is the most common mistake people make. And it can doom their search from the start. I know you’re eager to find that lost item. But not yet. Don’t look for it yet. Wait until you have some idea where to look. 12"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLE TWO It ’s Not Lost— You Are Hav e you ever stopped to think that maybe it’s you that are lost—not those keys or that umbrella? Because a fundamental truth is this: There are no missing objects. Only unsystematic searchers. Accept that—copy it down and tape it to your mir­ ro r—and you’ll soon be finding things with ease. 14 "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLE THREE Remember the Three C’s To find a lost object, you must be in the proper frame of mind. And that means paying attention to the Three C’s. They are: COMFORT Start by making yourself comfortable in an arm­ chair or sofa. Have a cup of tea, perhaps, or a stick of gum. CALMNESS Next, empty your mind of any unsettling thoughts. Pr eten d that the sea is lapping at your feet. Or that you’re sitting in a garden full of birds and flowers. CONFIDENCE Finally , tell yourself you will loc ate that m issing object. ( To enhance y our confidence, you might want to don a thinking cap. See instructions on how to make one.) Now you’re ready. To begin a systematic search. 16 "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLE FOUR It’s Where It’s Supposed to Be Believe it or not, things are often right where they’re supposed to be. Is there a place where your missing object is nor­ mally kept? A particular rack, or shelf, or drawer? If so, look there first. You may actually have hung up your coat last night. Or put the dictionary back on the shelf. Or returned the tape measure to the tool drawer. Even if you didn’t, someone may have done it for you. 18 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLE FIVE Domestic Drift Many objects do have a designated or customary place wh ere they are kept. But the reality is that they aren’t always returned there. Instead, they are left wherever last used. Such objects have undergone Domestic Drift. They could be anywhere in the house, or out in the yard. Relax. Get comfortable. Pour yourself a cup of cof­ fee. Now try to remember. Where were you last using that pliers, or tape m easur e, or fountain pen? Where did you last have it? Because that’s precisely where it still may be. 20"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLE SIX You’re Looking Right at It All right. You checked where it’s supposed to be, where it was last used, or where it might have been casually tossed. And it wasn’t there. Or...was it? It is possible to look directly at a missing object and not see it. This is due to the agitated state of mind that often accompanies a misplacement. Go back and look again. It may be staring you in the face. Occasionally, our distress is such that not only do we ov erloo k an o bject—w e forget what w e’re look­ ing for! To avoid this, repeatedly murmur the name of the object. (“Potholder, potholder, potholder.”) But why the agitation? Have we forgotten the sec­ ond C? Return to your armchair and get calm. 22 "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLE SEVEN The Camouflage Effect Don’ t be fooled. Your object may be right where you thought it was—but it has become hidden from view. Be sure to check under anything that could be covering your object, having inadvertently been placed on top of it. I call this the Camouflage Effect. Among the most common offenders are newspapers and sombreros. 24 "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLE EIGHT Think Back You were there at the scene of the misplacement. You were there when the object was put down— was left in an obscure location—was consigned to oblivion. You were there—because you did it! So you must have a memory—however faint—of where this happened. Are you pr epar ed to think back, an d r etriev e that memory? If so, you may soon be crying out “Of course!” and making a beeline to that forgotten place. 26 "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLE NINE Look Once, Look Well Don’t go around in circles. Once you’ve checked a site, don’t go back and check again. No matter how pr omising a site—if the object wasn’t there the first time, it won’t be there the second. Assuming, of course, that your first check was thorough. 28 "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLE TEN The Eureka Zone The majority of lost objects are right where you fig­ ure—once you take a moment to stop and figure. Others, however, are in the immediate vicinity of that place. They have undergone a displacement—a shift in location that, although minor, has served to ren­ der them invisible. Some examples: A pencil has rolled beneath a typewriter. A tool has been shoved to the rear of a drawer. A book on a shelf has gotten lodged behind other books. A fo lder has been m isfile d, several folders away from where it belongs. Objects are apt to wander. I have found, though, that they tend to travel no more than eighteen in ches fro m their original location. To the circle described by this eighteen­inch radius I have given a name. I call it the Eureka Z one. With the aid of a ruler (or a Eureka­Stik—see later), determine the Eureka Zone of your lost object. Then explore it. Meticulously. 30 "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLE ELEVEN Tail Thyself If you still haven’t found your object, it may be time to Recreate the Crime. Remove your thinking cap and don your detective’s cap. For you are about to follow your own trail. Let’s create a typical scenario. You come home from work and find a letter in the mail. Some time later you’re ready to read it...but it’s missing. You’re per­ turbed and perplexed. Where’s that letter? Okay, start at the door and retrace your steps since returning home. Where in the house did you go? To what specific locations? Stop at each of them and look for the letter. Hmm, a coat thrown across a chair. You were here. (Check under the coat and in its pockets.) A depression in the sofa. You were here. On the kitchen counter, a glass. You were here. On the table by the armchair, candy wrappers and a novel. You were here. And marking your place in the novel—aha! That missing letter. Good work, gumshoe. 32"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLE TWELVE It Wasn’t You When all else has failed, explore the possibility that your object hasn’t been misplaced. Rather, it’s been misappropriated. Perhaps someone you know has borrowed your umbrella. Or eaten your doughnut. Or taken your magazine into another room. Appr oach that person and inquire if such might not be the case. (“Have you by any chance seen my...?” is a tactful way to phrase this.) 34 "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"8.

Your missing object may eventually turn up. Until then, accept that you are being o ffer ed a lesson: in patience...or humility...or nonattachment to the things of this world. An d if not, so what? Lost keys, books, eyeglasses— even elephants!—can be replaced. Such losses are inconven ient and vexing. Yet surely they have their place in the inscrutable economy of the Universe. You’ve done what you can. So relax, and— with a shrug of resignation —accept the fate of your object. Qué será, será .

It will be as if a 67 68 "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"How to Proceed How should you go about using my method? What specific steps should you take, in order to recover your object? How exactly is a search to be conduct­ ed? There’s no one answer to that. Finding is an art; and every Finder develops a style—an approach— a modus operandi—of his own. Moreover, every misplacement is unique, and must be solved in an ad hoc fashion. But basically, here’s what I tell people: Sit down, make yourself comfortable, take a deep breath or two...and ponder. Ask yourself: Where is that object? In what obvious place? Try to recall or figur e out its whereabouts. And the most effective means of doing that? The Twelve Principles, of course. S im ply go through them, one by one, and see where they lead you. (If you haven’t yet memo­ rized the Principles, position my book in front of you. It’s been designed to lie flat, open to a partic­ ular Principle while you sip coffee, think, scratch yo ur head, r ere ad the Principle, stare off into space, sigh, rack your brains, etc.) When a possible location pops into mind, go check it o ut. If it’s a dud, return to your seat and continue as above. Rem ember, your frame of mind during this process is critical. Anxiety, self­reproach, haste—a Finder will have nothing to do with such Defeat Factors. 69 Instead, he is cool and collected. He sits and ponders, like a poet lost in reverie. He listens—to memories, brainstorms, hunches. And he searches with con­ fidence. But most of all, he applies the Principles. If you proceed as I have outlined, you should have no trouble in tracking down your object. 70 "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Ten Tips 1. One of the most common recovery areas for lost objects is the automobile. Your object may simply be lying on the car seat, where you left it. Or it may have become wedged between cushions, or have fallen on the floor. If you were traveling in an auto­ mobile, check these places. (And remember, check thoroughly. A cursory examination can be disas­ trous—as will be explained in “Common Mistakes to Beware.”) 2. Instead of being where it’s supposed to be, your object may be where something else is supposed to be. What happened was a mental lapse, in which one routine motion got substituted for another. For exam ple, your scissors are no rm ally kept in a jar on the kitchen counter; but mindlessly, you returned them to the tool drawer. 3. What were you wearing when you last remember having the object? Think back, then go search the pockets of those clothes. And be meticulous—search every pocket. The one you skip could be the one you’re after. 4. Are you one of those people who like to sprawl on the sofa? And your wallet—which you carry in a pants pocket—is missing? Maybe it fell out on the sofa. Go look. It should be noted that dropping things is not the same as misplacing them: no lapse of memory is involved. So if a set of keys has fallen from your pocket, or an earring from your ear, most of the Principles will not be relevant. One that will be, however, is “Tail Thyself.” Simply follow your trail about the house, closely examining the floor, stairs, seat cushions, etc. 5. To reduce the likelihood of a misplacement, and to facilitate any searches that become necessary, keep your home neat and orderly. Remember the maxim: A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING AND EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE . 6. If a loss is thought to have occurred outside the home, sit down and review your movements dur­ ing the day. Then te lephon e around, to see whether the item has been found. If it’s a wallet, bag, or briefcase that may have been left in a store, have them check near the cash register: while paying, you may have put it down, then left it behind. Or if you dropped something, a good Samaritan may 71 72 "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"have found it and left it with the cashier. In the case of institutions—schools, community centers, the­ atres—ask if they have a lost­and­found. Should this phone search prove fruitless (or not be feasible), leave the house and return to the loca­ tions you visited during the day. At each of them retrace your steps—keeping a sharp eye out for the object. But remember: neither of the above should be re­ sorted to prematurely. First search your house— search your own immediate surroundings. For that’s usually where a missing object is. Don’t race back in a panic to the supermarket—only to discover your wallet tucked away in the wrong section of your purse. 7. Objects do disappear—thanks to thieves, trade rats, leprechauns, and the like. However, such incidents are infr equent; and their slight possibility must not provide an excuse for abandoning the search. Be ste adfast. That diamond ring has simply been m is­ laid, and can be found—if you are persistent and methodical. 8. Be sure you’re not looking for a phantom posses­ sion: something you had planned to purchase but then never did. (Or something you acquired in a dre am.) 73 9. As you sit and ponder the whereabouts of a lost object, your state of mind should be like that of a daydreamer: relaxed and contemplative. But when you get up to go check a site, shift gears. Be alert, energetic, and thorough—you’re a detective now. 10. Where has this object been found before? To what location does it seem to gravitate? Where has it turned up again and again? Routinely, objects are mislaid in the same place— the same obvious place. Keys are left in locks. Brief­ cases in cars. Eyeglasses atop heads. Try looking there... before you ransack the house. 74 "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Common Mistakes to Beware I see the same mistakes being made, again and again, in connection with lost objects. Among them are: The Panicky Presumption Pity the poor soul who goes through wastebaskets or garbage bags—or even races to the town dump! —in search of something that’s right where it’s sup­ posed to be. The Rash Accusation “Who’ s got my coffee mug?” (or stapler or newspa­ per or elephant) we demand, after only a superficial search. A rash accusation—in what will probably prove a case of mere misplacement. The Maniacal Search Our misplacement throws us into a frenzy; and like a wild man we search the entire house. We stalk about, rifling through drawers, emptying boxes, turning things inside out—and utterly neglecting the Twelve Principles. Maniacal searches are undignified and exhausting. Worse yet, they tend to fail: an agitated eye will pass right over its quarry. Apply the Principles! Mistaken Image of an Object I once helped a friend search his bookshelves for a particular book. He had described it to me as a hardback. So that’s what we looked for—at length and in vain. Finally, I grew suspicious of his description, and began to examine the paper­ backs as well. And there it was, in plain sight. Our false image of the book had prevented us from finding it. Wild Goose Chase Suspicion We are about to se arch our house for an object. Yet we suspect that it’s not in the house, and that we are embarking on a Wild Goose Chase. So we search half­heartedly—causing us to over­ look the object. Which convinces us that it’s not in the house. 75 76 "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Initial Discouragement We’ve misplaced some tiny item—a pill, say, or a screw—and it could be anywhere in the house. We consider not even attempting a search. “I’m not go­ ing to find it,” we murmur. “That darn thing’s gone forever.” No! Say instead: “It is here somewhere, and I shall succeed in finding it. Why? Because I’ve got the Twelve Principles. Principles that work.” The Quick Look As we sit and ponder the whereabouts of an object, a number of possible sites come to mind. So we take a Quick Look—a mere glance—into those nearest at hand. The idea is to move on to more prom ising sites. These initial ones, we tell our­ selves, can always be returned to for a closer inspec­ tion. A harmless expedient? Not if it results in an over­ looked object. For we may misremember those initial site s as having been cl ose ly inspected, and n ever return to them. N OTE : Th e Quick Look is not to be confused with the Cool On ce­ov er. The Cool Once­over is a legitimate shortcut, and should precede any meticulous search. It works like this: You suspect an object to be somewhere in a particular room, and are about to search that room. Before doing so, give it a general survey—an alert roving of the eye—a Cool Once­ over. Your object may be sitting in plain sight. If so, you will spot it and avoid a meticulous search. If not, move 77 immediately into the search. (Don’t go off and survey other rooms, lest you fail to return to this one—a Quick Look after all!)

Is there a mysterious region into which they van­ ish, never to be seen again? Do supernatural forces or beings cause the disappearance of some objects? Of course not (though an occasional leprechaun may pilfer things fr om the kitchen at night). Rath er, one of the following phenomena may be involved: Pocket Gobble Absent­mindedly, we slip something into one of our pockets. It’s still there. 79 The Treasure­Trove Syndrome We hide some valuables in a distinctive place—a location so unique that it will be sure to stick in our memory. Oh yeah? They’re still there.

But a vertical displacement may be involved as well (for example, a golf ball rolling off a desk and dropping to the floor), followed by a secondary hori­ zontal displacement (the ball bouncing off somewhere). In such cases, use the formula EZ = 18 + d + bf where EZ is the Eureka Zone, d is the distance the object drops, and bf is the bounce factor. (Bounce factors range from 250 to zero. See table below.)

The classic tale of such a search is “The Purloined Letter” by Edgar Allan Poe. It goes as follows: The Paris police are trying to recover a compromis­ ing letter that has been stolen from a royal person­ age. Believing it to be concealed in the home of a cer tain government official, they undertake a search of the premises. Their search is meticulous. Every square inch of the apartment is scrutinized, every conceivable hiding place looked into. Drawers are emptied—chairs are dismantled—cushions are probed with long needles. The floors, walls, and ceilings are exam­ ined with a microscope, for signs of replastering. Yet the letter cannot be found. C. Auguste Dupin, an aristocratic sleuth, is brought into the case. Using his powers of analysis, he con­ ducts a search of his own...and locates the letter almost immediately. Wh en he de livers it to the police, they are amazed. Wher e was it? they want to know. How could their minute examination of the apartment have failed to uncover it? Dupin smiles languidly, and explains that the official—aware that a meticulous search would be conducted for the letter—“had resorted to the 90 "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.” Instead, the man The Game’s Afoot had left it in plain sight, crumpled up as if unim­ portant and thrust carelessly into a rack. And there the police ignored it. After all, the letter they were seeking would have been carefully pre­ served and tucked away in some secret place. Had Dupin been familiar with the Twelve Princi­ ples, he might have told the red­faced gendarmes: “Messieurs, you were looking right at it.” 91 In “The Man with the Twisted Lip,” Sherlock Holmes is engaged to locate a husband who has mysteri­ ously disappeared. Watson gives this description of Holmes solving the case: A large and comfortable double­bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or con­ vince d himself that his data w ere insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all­night sitting. He took off his coat and waist­coat, pu t on a large blue dressing­gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross­legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp, I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upo n his strong­set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejac­ ulatio n caused me to wake up, and I found the sum­ mer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curling upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night. 92"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"“Awake, Watson?” he asked. “Yes.” “Game for a morning drive?” “Certainly.” “Then dress....” He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the somber thinker of the previous night. What better example of someone applying the Three C’s—Comfort, Calmness, and Confidence—as he begins a hunt! 93 Freud’s Fee According to Freud, objects may be intentionally misplaced. We want to forget where we left them. We want to overlook them. In The Psychopathology of Everyday Life , he describes “the unconscious dexterity with which an object is mislaid on account of hidden but powerful motives.” These motives involve “the low estima­ tio n in which the lost object is held, or a secret antipathy towards it or towards the person that it came from.” Freud tells of a patient who could not find the keys to his desk, despite a painstaking search of his apar tment. Sensing that the loss was intentional— a “ sym ptomatic act”—the patient had his servant take up the search. The servant found the keys. The patient then delved into his unconscious. Why, he wondered, had he been unable to locate the keys? What had been his s ecret mo tive? Could it r elate so me­ how to his treatment session with Freud, scheduled for the following day? Suddenly , it dawned on him. Their loss had pre­ vente d a certain d raw er from being opened—the drawer in which the money for his treatment was kept. His motive for losing the keys? Secret rage, he realized, at having to pay Freud so high a fee! If you suspect your own misplacement to be inten­ tional, have a friend join in the search. 94"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Hrönir In his story “Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,” Jorge Luis Borges tells of a world where (among other marvels) lost objects duplicate themselves. Thus, a searcher may come upon the object itself—or may hav e found its duplicate. Known as hrönir , th ese duplicates are usually mistaken for the object. They are not, however, exact copies. A hrön may be slight­ ly larger than the original, and will possess some imperfection of form. Ther e are also hrönir that barely resemble the ob­ ject that engendered them. Instead, they fulfill the searcher’s desires in regard to that object. For exam­ ple, he loses a pencil...and finds a fountain pen. In the real world, hrönir shouldn ’t be a problem. But do take care to search for the actual object— no t (as in my se arch for the supposedly hardcover book) an idealized image of it. 95 A True Account The following letter is from Larry Callahan, an artist in Southern California, whom I had introduced to the Twelve Principles: Dear Professor Solomon, I had an experience recently that involved your method. A friend needed a rental car; and I agreed to drive him to the airport to pick one up. I had some errands to run—letters to mail at the post office, and checks to deposit at my bank—so I decided to do it all in a sin­ gle trip. I placed the letters and checks together in one pile (aware that this was reckless, but trusting myself to separate them at the appr opriate moment), grabbed my car keys, and set out. My first stop was the post office, where I deposited the letters in a curbside mailbox. Then I picked up my friend and proceeded to the airport. At the rental agency he went inside, while I waited to make sure there was no problem. As I sat in my car, I no tice d an accumulation of trash on the floor. Why no t put these idle minutes to use, I said to myself, and do some car cleaning? So I gathered up the trash— bags, fliers, newspapers, and what­not—and dropped it into a receptacle outside the agency. My friend em erge d with a set of keys and a rental con­ tract. I said goo dby e and drove off, headed now for my bank. At the bank I parked and looked about for those checks. Th ey w ere nowhere to be seen. Frowning, I checked my pockets. I peered into the glove compartment. I poked about on the floor and under the seat. All to no avail. The checks had disappeared. I tried not to panic. My anxiety level was rising, 96"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"though—when I recalled your method. The Twelve Principles, I murmured. Why not give them a try? The first that came to mind was “Don’t look for it.” Too late there—I had already searched the car. I moved on to “The three C’s”—adjusting the seat to get comfortable, taking deep breaths to calm myself, and telling myself that the checks had to be SOME­ WHERE. Next came “You’re looking right at it.” I was? The checks were right in front of me? I glared at an empty dash­ board. Then I remembered the Principle about thinking back. So I thought back, trying to picture what I had done with the checks. AND I SAW MYSELF PUTTING THEM TOGETHER WITH THE LETTERS! I gr oane d. It was ob vio us what had happened. I had dropped the whole pile into the mailbox—just as I had known I was capable of doing. What a ridiculous thing to have done! My checks were gone, swallowed up by the postal system. But wait—maybe they were retrievable. A leviathan had swallowed them; but maybe I could descend into its belly and get them back. It was worth a try. Our local post office is a small, friendly place. Conceivably, they would take pity on me. Trying to stay calm, I returned to the post office and explained to a postal employee what had happened. Other employees gathered to listen, and to shake their heads at my blunder. Was there any way to get the checks back? I asked. I was told that a pr ocedur e did exist for retrieving mail. I would have to fill out a form, and pay a small charge, for each item returned to me. “Let’s go for it,” I said, trying to sound jocular. First we looked through the hampers in the back room. Plenty of mail, but no loose checks. Then we went outside, opened the mailboxes, and checked their con­ tents. Still no checks. I racked my brains. Where else could they be? Think back. I thought back...and saw myself gathering up that trash in my car. O no. The checks must have fallen on the floor, and been in with the trash. “That’s it!” I cried. “They’re in the trash can!” I described this new theory to the postal employees.They began to look at me funny. Bidding them a hasty fare­ well, I dashed to my car and drove back to the airport. At the rental agency I got out of my car and eyed the trash receptacle. I removed its lid and looked in. There was nothing inside. The receptacle had been emptied since my departure. By the garage were a pair of rubbish bins. I approached them, hoisted myself up on one of them, and peered insid e—at a mass of rubbish. In these bins the agency emptied its trash; and in these bins, I was convinced, were my checks. O my, what was I to do? I could do the sensible thing and admit defeat. After all, the checks were replaceable. It would be tiresome and embarrassing; but I could contact each client, explain my blunder, and ask for a new check. Or—the indignity be damned!—I could search through the bins. I decided to search. Taking a deep breath, I climbed into the bin and sank knee­d eep in trash. The agency disposed of a large quantity of com pu ter printouts; and had it not been for the coffee grounds, pencil shavings, and snack remains mixed in, I might have enjoyed as a lark my de scent into this binful of paper. But I persevered. Finding nothing in the first bin, I hopped out and climbed into the second. Incredibly, after a bit of digging, I found my checks. They were among some contract forms and crushed 97 98 "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"cups. I emerged from that bin knowing more than I cared to about the underbelly of the car­rental busi­ ness. But I had my checks. Without the Principles I would never have found them. Your method is invaluable, for people like me when we do something stupid! Much thanks. Yours, Larry The above is a testimonial, which I appreciate. But it is also a cautionary tale. For the truth is that Larry was lucky . Let’s take a look at his case. Yes, he emerged from the rubbish bin triumphantly clutching his checks. They were in there. But they could just as easily have been under his car seat, between the cushions, in the glove compartment, or in one of his pockets. While he may have looked in these places, he does not seem to have looked well. “I checked...I peered...I poked about,” he tells us—describing a search that sounds to me cursory and incomplete. In other words, he should have begun with a metic­ ulous search of his car. Instead, he took a Quick Look, then succumbed to one Panicky Presump­ tion after another. They’re in the mailbox! he cried —n o, the trash c an!—n o, the bin! That o ne o f these long shots happened to pan out does not justify his failure to have eliminated first the more likely sites. De scending into a rubbish bin must always remain a last resort. 5. This and That 99 "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Some Quotes There is no such thing as a lost movie—only mislaid movies.

Another time, I arrived in Santa Monica, California, by bus; and the baggage clerk was unable to find a pair of boxes I had checked. My heart sank; and I was resigning myself to never again seeing those boxes—wh en a mad hope gripped me. I asked if I might enter the baggage room and look about for them. The clerk allowed me to do so...and there were my boxes, sitting on a rack. Somehow he had overlooked them.

There are, of course, exceptions and complications. The duty is waived if the object’s owner can be ex­ pecte d to have given up hope for its return. And one must be sure the object was lost. If there are signs of its having been deliberately left where found, then the object must not be removed—since to do so would cause its loss. But the basic idea is that finders are not keepers— in order that losers not be weepers.

It’s about Lone Cloud, and how he learned that some lost objects should stay lost! ● One day Lone Cloud got lost in the forest. On and on he walked, sure that he would soon come upon a path. But the forest grew denser, the shadows deeper. Now and again rose the cry of the raven—an eerie sound in this pathless place. And Lone Cloud began to feel anx­ ious. I’m truly lost, he thought. Th en the forest came to an end; and Lone Cloud found himself descending into a valley. Only grass grew in this valley. Winding its way through the grass was a stream. As he walked along, Lone Cloud was surprised by what he saw scattered in the grass. For everywhere were arti­ cles of daily life—bows, arrows, traps, pots, bowls, balls, whistles, bracelets, cloaks, moccasins. Lone Cloud noticed the raven, perched on a basket. “Where am I?” he asked the wisest of creatures. “In W annamoho,” said the raven, “the Valley of Lost Things. S trewn about you are the missing possessions of your people.” “Our missing possessions?” “Yes. They have been coming here for countless gen­ erations—ever since the first of your ancestors mislaid something.” “But how do they get here?” 116"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"“They are brought by the Wind That Laughs. The mo­ ment something is given up for lost, he laughs—and wafts it to this valley.” Lone Cloud—who had never heard of Wannamoho— gazed about in wonder. The Valley of Lost Things! And he recalled a pouch he had lost years before. Richly em broidered, it had contained a fine pipe and powerful tobacco. How precious that pouch had been to him, and how he would like it back! “The pouch I mislaid—it is here in this valley?” “It is.” “Sho w me wh ere. I shall retrieve it and take it back with me.” “I wo uldn ’t do that. Your pouch belongs now in Wan­ namoho. To remove it could bring bad luck upon you.” “Nonsense,” said Lone Cloud. And he insisted the raven lead him to his pouch. So the raven flew into the air, circled about, and fluttered down to the grass. Lone Cloud came running over—and there was his lost pouch. “Aha!” he cried, grabbing it up. He opened it and beheld his pipe and tobacco. Amazingly, the tobacco was still pungent. Pleased to have regained his pouch, Lone Cloud departed from the valley and wandered the forest. At last he came upon a path, and by dusk was back at his hut. That night he filled the pipe and smoked it. And he was puffing away and murmuring pleasurably and thinking that this indeed was how to spend his eve­ nings (and maybe his days, to o)—wh en his hut col­ lapsed about him! Daze d, Lone Cloud crawled out of the ruins. And he wondered: Could this be that bad luck of which the raven had warned?

Tell me what I must do to get rid of it.” “The pouch must go back to Wannamoho,” said the raven. “Only then will this bad luck leave you.” So Lone Cloud roamed the forest, looking for the Val­ ley of Lost Things. He wanted to return the pouch to where he had found it. But try as he might, he could not locate that strange valley. “What am I to do?” he groaned. “Until this pouch is back in Wannamoho, misfortune will hound me.” Returning to the ruins of his hut, he found the raven perch ed there. “Wisest of creatures,” said Lone Cloud, “I looked and looked, but could not find Wannamo­ ho.” “It is hard to find.” “Ho w then am I to return this pouch? Perhaps y ou could take it back for me?” said Lone Cloud, holding out the pouch. “O no,” said the raven. “Then what am I to do?” “Go help the beaver.” Strange advice, thought Lone Cloud. But he walked along the river until he found the beaver, who was dragging a tree into the water. “Let me help you,” he said to the most industrious of creatures. 119 “I could use some help,” said the beaver. “Come, lend me a hand.” So Lone Cloud put down his pouch and joined the beaver. All day they labored together—felling trees, dragging them to the river, and building a dam. The wo rk was strenuous, and Lone Cloud wanted to quit. But he was determined to do as the raven had advised. Finally, the beaver thanked him and swam off. Lone Cloud sighed with relief. He was tired and hungry; it was time to go home and eat. He looked about for his pouch. But where was it? He had left it by the river—but where exactly he couldn’t recall. “Where’s that pouch?” cried Lone Cloud. Up and down the river he searched for it. He seemed to remember having left it under a bush—but which bush? For a long time he searched, but without success. Finally he gave up , plopped to the ground, and sat there frowning. A wind rustled in the trees. But then his frown dissolved, and a gleam entered his 120"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"eye. For he realized he had lost the pouch again.
