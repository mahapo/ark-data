This was in part due to the technical advice of P at Devin, an Elder and the first officer of the Southern California local council of C.O.G. (Covenant of the Goddess) established in California in 1975, an incorporated, religious, non-profit organization. [ In 1996, there were approximately 250,000 Wiccans in the United States. ] While much of the technically correct information in the movie was a fresh relief for many of us, Hollywood also had filled the movie with the normal amount of special effects. Y ou know, the kind that have nothing whatsoever to do with “real magick.” In the past few years, large numbers of people after seeing “The Craft” turned towards Wicca with the impression that the movie was a real reflection of what they could learn. This misconception was further in-forced by a number of new T elevison shows and more Hollywood movies. Never had a little bit of truth created so much confusion. ~ P arker T orrence What is Wicca? \"Basically, W icca is an evolving religion which originated from paganism, the oldest religion in the world. ... It's an earth-oriented religion which has a consciousness towards ecology , not domination of the earth. We ar e part of everything that is going on around us.

What is Magick, & why read this book? “Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will.” ~ Aleister Crowley Or in more modern terminology: Magick is the methodology of attracting to one’s self, those events requir ed for the achievement of a goal. Read this book if you want to know the truth about casting a circle, and crafting a spell. Read this book if you want to learn how to achieve your goals. Read, and discover the Joy of Magick! What should you learn/know first? This is just my opinion, but I believe that the single most important thing you can learn in regards to magick, is the Wiccan Rede and the Three Fold Law! Bide the Wiccan Rede you must, In perfect love, in perfect trust. Eight words the Wiccan Law Fulfill: “An it harm none, do as you will.” Lest in your own defense it be, Ever mind the Rule of Three. Follow this with mind and heart, Merry meet, and merry part .... The witches in the movie were not Wiccan, but there are many Wiccan elements in the rituals that they use. I am not Wiccan, but I draw from Wiccan sources for my rituals. Y ou do not have to be Wiccan to practice magick, but you do need to understand that Wiccan or not, you are still governed by the Three Fold Law of Return. “Whatever you send out comes back times three!” “As ye sow, so shall ye reap.” Call it what you like, use whatever words you wish, but understand all things move in a circle and you always get back what you put out. It might not be tomorrow, or next year, but somewhere down the road it will come back to you three fold. Both the good and the bad. Are you ready? This too is the Joy of Magick!

If you desire to become a Wiccan, contact a Gardnerian coven (or some other T radition). Apply for admission, learn and follow to the letter the beliefs and teachings of that T radition. If you desire to become a Ceremonial Magician, contact the OTO (or some other Order). Apply for admission, learn and follow to the letter the teachings of that Order. “Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.” ~Ralph W aldo Emerson Now if you are seeking a path that is not at one of these two extremes, there is hope. Like the witches in the movie, you can learn and practice an eclectic form of magick. Y ou can do this in a group, or you can do this as a Solitaire. Wicca is a child of P aganism, and only one of its’ many flavors. There are structured T raditions like Ásatrú or the many Druidic groups. Or there are just as many eclectic groups, that draw from both wicca, and non- wiccan sources. If you are very adventurous, you can create your own eclectic path, before you do that, please read the rest of this book. An old adage states, “you should not break the rules, until after you first know how to use them correctly .” This is even more true when it comes to the practice of magick! Hollywood, television and the hard-copy entertainment industry like to spew forth the misinformed concept that there are Good and Evil forms of magick. In my opinion that is on the same level as saying every head of every country is a perfect person, and has never ever done (or even thought) anything moral or ethically wrong. If that was true about politicians, then we would have world peace, no human rights violations, unemployment and crime would be at zero. The reality of magick is, it just exists. Like air or water. It takes on the form and color of the person using it. If your desire is to do harm, (society may call it evil,) and if you employ magick to do it, well remember the Three Fold Law! Most people practice magick that is a reflection of their personalities. If a person is self centered and self serving, magick will not change them. Personally I would not want them in any group I was working in. With the practice of magick, comes responsibility for ones own actions (more on this in the next section). Y our first responsibility should be to find a path that is suited to your needs. Do you need the structure and discipline of a Coven or Order? Do you need to belong to something with a history and a set of (never changing) traditions? Or do you need the freedom that an eclectic solitaire path would provide? I am a simple P agan and I walk an eclectic solitaire path. I have, and do work with small groups from time to time, and I have had some formal training. My reasons for this path are simple, I spent twenty years of my life in the Navy at a time when there were very few P agans in the military. It fit my needs.

Maybe if you have a maid, a nanny and someone to do your shopping, and you’ve trained them to understand facial tic commands. Then, and only then will you get the result that you seek. When it comes to the reality of magick, you’ll get those results, faster the old fashioned way . I have yet to meet anyone who can balance and spin a pencil with their mind, walk on water (without it being frozen first) or fly through the air (without the use of an aircraft). These are the dreams of the young and the science of the Hollywood special effects artist. It is said that there are those in the far east who have mastered some of these feats. They’ve spent their whole life in meditation to achieve this. So if you are ready to give up, fast food, cable television, the Internet, and indoor plumbing. Go book a flight to India, seek a guru, and we’ll see you in 80 years. If, on the other hand, you are not yet willing to give up your standard of living, the reality of magick is that it can not alter or break the physical laws of nature. In fact, magick is just the employment of nature’s laws for the achievement of ones’ goals. These laws of magick are not the occult secrets that some would have you believe. Just go to any reputable Human Growth Seminar and see how many of these “occult secrets” are being openly employed by non-magick users. If you don’t have the time, then pick up a copy of “Think and Grow Rich” and you’ll find many of these secret teachings spelled out. Before you begin the practice of magick, you should understand that, like life itself, ther e is a certain responsibility that you accept. Y ou are responsible for each and every action, thought and deed. There is no devil, the music, and movies don’t have subliminal messages hidden in them, and regardless of how dysfunctional your childhood was, you, and only you are responsible for your own actions! If you like being a victim, if you need an escape goat to go through life with, then the last thing you need to do is learn magick. Magick is about responsibility , and respect. Responsibility for yourself, and r espect for all living creatures. It is one P agan view point that the Great Mother gave birth to all things, meaning that we are all part of each other, as well as every living creature and rock. Do you respect yourself? Do you respect the environment around you? If you don’t respect yourself, how do you expect to be responsible with the art of magick, and respect its’ use. Never practice magick from the space of fear or anger. These emotions, both tend to sour the desired results. In group work, you are only as strong, as your weakest link. That is why fear is the last thing you need in any group or circle.

Lighting of the Y ule Log is symbolic of welcoming the sun. Imbolg, also called Lady’s Day , is a time of renewal. In days past a common fire was lit, and all members of a community would take a brand from the fire home, to rekindle their own hearth fires. T oday we call it Groundhog day . Ostara, the Spring Equinox, a time when daylight and night are in balance. A time of blessing the seed, planting, and fertility . Beltain, a hinge day when winter gives way to summer. Again the veil is thin between the worlds. Dance around a May Pole, celebrate the joy and ecstacy of life. Litha, the Summer Solstice, the shortest night of the year. Time to rejoice in the warmth of the sun, while the world is full of growing life. Lughnassadh, the first of the harvest festivals. In Celtic tradition it is the day the young son challenges his father the King, for rulership. In the course of their battle, the father is wounded, this is symbolized by the following days growing cooler. Mabon, the second harvest festival, the Fall Equinox. Once again daylight and night are in balance. Now is the time to celebrate the gifts of the Earth Mother.

T o be honest I have felt that most of these were more the various author trying to justify their personal beliefs. With that said, I will now attempt to answer the question as to why P agans worship multiply deities. T o barrow from a popular movie series, everything that exists has within it the FORCE. There is only one FORCE, and it is within all things! Now this idea is nothing new, and before Star Wars it was mor e commonly known as the TAO . The TA O is a beautiful concept, but is has only one major flaw, it has no face. Humans, being the creatures that we are, like to have faces and personalities attached to our divine beings. Let me also state that P agans do not really worship these Gods and Goddesses. What we do is “Honor the aspect of the divine that they reflect.” By employing a name of a God or Goddess our human psyche connects with the Archetype symbol that they represent for us. Common examples: Diana the Huntress for many brings to mind a maiden who is wild and free. Frigga the Mother is evoked often by both P agans and non-pagans with the words “T .G.I.F .” As the “F” stands for Friday , and once upon a time that was Frigga T ag, or Frigga Day . We all have strong emotions about Friday . Hecate the crone brings to mind for many , an ancient woman sitting over a cauldron. Just to be fair to the male aspect of the divine, there is P an the goat footed God of male youth. The Oak King brings to mind the strength and warmth of summer. While the Holly King is symbolic of the joys of the winter season. “Deck the halls with boughs of Holly , tra-la-la-la-la la-la la la. Tis the season to be jolly ...” etc. etc. What deities you choose to honor, unless you are following a T radition, are very much a personal matter. These pages have a number of Gods and Goddess listed. These are provided as reference for your own research. (Greek and Roman deities have not been listed.) In the later sections of this book, I will be employing the “Basic Celtic” deities for simplicity and reference.

Regardless if you call the Lady Gaia, Frigga or Dana. Underlaying her power, are the three aspects of Maiden, Mother & Crone, (Lunar archetypes). In some traditions these are three distinctively different Goddesses. In other traditions, they are the same Goddess at different stages of Her development. Then there are Goddesses like the T riple Morrigan - Macha, Nemain and Babd. Then we have the T wo Fold God. The Lord is normally viewed as being symbolic of the Summer season, and the Winter season.

The idea of guardians dwelling in Watch T owers, is not something from the far distant past. It is, more a creation of the medieval magician, coming to us from a time when the lords of the land dwelt and ruled from their castles. Even more perplexing, is that many P agan and Wiccan systems name, and call upon the Hebrew Archangels as the Watchers who dwell within these T owers at the edge of the world. The singer, song writer, Kate Bush, on her album The Red Shoes, has within the lyrics of the song Lily , incorporated the traditional words to summon the Archangels from their Watch T owers ... “Gabriel before me Raphael behind me Michael on my right Urial on my left side” ~ Lily by Kate Bush In The Craft, part of the invocation of the Spirit Monon also calls upon the power of these guardians to aid in the ritual working. The elements in magick are not the same elements that you find in Chemistry class, or your back yard, although they are symbolic of each other. It is this symbolic relationship that we employ in the art of magick. The qualities of the physical reflect the power of the occult. “As Above, So Below!” Earth is the foundation element. It is solid, dependable and stable. In magick its’ color is green or black, and it is used in spells for employment, money, fertility , and prosperity of any kind. The Celtic Goddess, Dana is associated with Earth. In the T arot it is the suit of P antacles, or Coins. It is also know as Assiah, the Material World.

Altars can be a chaotic collection of items, or an aesthetic expression of spirituality . An altar should reflect the personality of its’ user, or within a coven, order or group, the teachings of that T radition. Altars can take any form, from a ritual table, to the top of your bedroom dresser. It is the place for you to honor the Lord and Lady, and to work your magick. Basic ritual tools are, the Chalice, the Athame (pronounced, ath-AH-may), the Pentacle, and the Wand. Chalice ... this tool, more then any other, represents the creative aspect of the Goddess. It is the symbol of the womb. In ritual, it is used for the sharing of wine, juice, or herbal potions. It can also be employed for scrying. It is associated with the element of water. Athame ... this tool represents the active principle of the God. Usually it is black handled, with a double-edged blade. In ritual, it is used to cast the circle, as well as to evoke or banish energies. It is associated with the element of air. Pentacle ... often made of wood, stone, ceramic, wax, glass, or metal, this tool represents the Goddess in a passive, supporting role. In ritual, it is used to support, protect, and contain the energies being used. It is associated with the element of earth. Wand ... the most personal of the basic tools. T raditionally made of wood, and a cubit in length (the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger), it frequently has in its construction a drop of its’ owner blood. Modern wands are often fashioned of copper tubes, covered in leather or cloth, and tipped with crystals or semi-precious gem stones. This tool is viewed as having a male end for projection, and a female or receptive end. Much like the Athame, the W and can be employed to cast a circle, but its’ true power lies at a higher level, when used to invoke, and dismiss spiritual entities. It is associated with the element of fire. Miscellaneous Altar tools ... These include candles, cords, censor/thurible/incense, bell, sword, staff, crystal ball, scrying stone, magick mirror, T arot cards, Rune stones, oils, cauldron, mortar & pestle, bolline, and broom. T o name a few. Y our Book of Shadows, or Grimoire, is one of the most important tools you will ever own. In The Craft, it was the place where the young witches wrote down their thoughts and spells. Called a Book of Shadows, because magick is not black or white. This is a journal, a collection of rituals, and a personal collection of spell recipes. T radition, states that it must be hand written, with magical inks using a special consecrated pen of art. More often then not, the modern practitioner will have computer scans and printouts taped or glued within its pages. The truly techno-pagan might even have the whole thing stored on their computer’s hard drive. Regardless of what medium your Book of Shadows takes, it should be arranged (in a minimum of) three sections, and certain things should be included within its’ pages. The first section should have some general information and personal notes. Among this information should be your magical, or craft name. This is a holdover from the days when free thinkers were persecuted, and the only name within your group, you might be know by would be this magical pseudonym. When you pick a name to use, it should be one that expresses your higher goals, and reflect the path you choose to follow . If you are walking a predominantly Celtic path, a name like Redwood Dream Catcher, would not be in harmony with your goals. Another item that should be in the first part of your Grimore, is your astrology chart. Some groups and covens require this information, and your Book of Shadows is an excellent place to keep it.

P agans don’t worship multiple gods, so much as they do Honor the Lord & Lady as aspects of the Divine (known by such names as the Spirit, the TA O, and everyone’s favorite, the FORCE). Magick can be practiced as a means of self advancement along a spiritual path (Theurgy). It can also be practiced for material goals (Thaumaturgy). Magick is not Good or Evil, Black or White, magick just IS! Like air, water or even gravity, it works the same no matter what is in the heart of the user.

The trained mind, the magician’s consciousness, will focus without being distracted by events around it. { { The Super-Consciousness is the magician’s link to the Divine. At this level of awareness, time & space are fluid, and for those who understand how to perceive them, there are no secrets. “The creativity of the subconscious is unlimited.” Thomas D. Willhite “The creativity of the subconscious is unlimited.” The Sub-Conscious mind is where the true authority of the magician resides. This source of power is the force behind our magick.

This book can take many forms, but I have found that the 3-ring notebook binder works best. It is from this book, that you will transfer information into your Book of Shadows. Each time you practice anything related to the learning of magick, cast a spell, preform a ritual, have a profound vision or dream, you should record it in your Journal. Some people have a separate notebook just for dreams. Each entry should have the following basic information: Date, time (both start & stop), emotional state of mind, and location. The journal entries should have the complete text of any spell or ritual you conduct. Impressions, and effects should also be recorded. If diligently kept, this Journal is a great tool for self-understanding, as well as your companion, and guide in the study of magick! Breathing, or Pranayama is generally accepted to be one of the most important disciplines that the aspiring Witch, or Magician needs to learn, and master. h Sit in a place where you will not be disturbed. For a short time breath normally and clear your mind of all mundane thoughts. h When you are ready ... Breath OUT for four heart beats, HOLD your breath for a two heart beats, breath IN for four heart beats, and HOLD your breath for two heart beats ... repeat for about five minutes. (When holding your breath, DO NOT forcibly block the air flow. Just learn to NOT exhale or inhale!) h Once you have mastered the 4-2-4-2 breathing pattern, expand your abilities with a 6-3-6-3 pattern. h When you have mastered the 6-3-6-3 breathing pattern, begin increasing the length of time from five minutes, until you are able to preform this for 30 minutes, without any conscious thought about your breathing. Record the results in your W ork Journal. Posture, or Asana is a principal ability when it comes to preforming Rituals. If your goal is the mastery of Ceremonial Magick, the following information will differ some from postures found in that discipline. h Sitting ... you can do this in a chair, you can do this on the ground, you can do this with your legs crossed, and you can do this in the Lotus position. However you wish to do it, the following should always be true: Y our head needs to be up. Y our spine needs to be straight. Y our hands should be open, with the palms up. h Wand ... in this postur e, you are standing erect with your arms relaxed at your sides. h T ao ... in this posture, you are standing erect with your arms extended out to your sides. (Some times known as the cross.) h Goddess ... in this posture, you are standing erect, your face tilted slightly up, and your arms upraised in welcome. This is the posture that the witches in The Craft used, when they invoked Monon at the beach. h God ... in this posture, you are standing erect with your arms crossed over your chest, with your hands upon your shoulders, right hand-left shoulder, left hand-right shoulder. (Sometimes known as the star.) There are other postures, but if you can master these, you will have a formidably group of skills in your ritual tool box. T o master any of the above listed postures, stand (or sit) in that posture while preforming your breathing practice. Record the results in your W ork Journal.

Meditation comes in three basic flavors ... passive, active, and chant. P assive, is the form most people think about when they hear the word meditation. This is the art of sitting with your mind stilled. Y ou begin by establishing your patterned breathing 4-2-4-2. Next you relax your body (see active meditation below), and then slowly silence all of the voices within your head until you can hear a kind of silence. At this point you begin to observe your body , and mind. P assive meditation is used when you seek inner knowledge, when you do scrying, and when you channel a deity . Record the results in your W ork Journal. Active meditation ... the use of meditation with a pre-established script, or goal. The relaxation practice (see script at side), path workings, and calling down the moon, are all forms of active meditation. Always record your results in your Journal. Chant ... in The Craft, when the witches were sitting in the park repeating Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, they wer e using what is known as a circle chant meditation to raise their power levels. Chants can vary from a one word personal mantra, to a formal group invocation. T ry this, on an overcast day , sit and chant for five minutes “Ra, Ra, Hail Ra!” Record the results in your Journal.

Then the candle needs to be anointed with oil. This is known as dressing the candle, and is done by rubbing oil onto the surface. Y ou start at the center, and rub outwards. First you put on the shirt (anoint the upper half of the candle), then you put on the pants (anoint the lower half of the candle). Now the candle is ready for your spell. Once you’re ready , hold the candle upright between your palms. Begin your rhythmic breathing, visualize your goal, and allow the power of your desire to flow into the candle. Begin repeating a short statement of the desired goal you seek. Slowly shorten the statement down, until it is the minimum number of words required to express the concept. At the peak of your chanting, take a deep breath and slowly blow life into the candle. Place the candle into a holder on your altar (...continue chanting...) light a match, draw the power from above down to your candle, and light the wick. Place the burning match into a flame safe dish, and allow it to burn out by itself. Cup your hands around the candle’s flame, while you visualize, and state your goal fully one last time. Then say “This is my will, so mote it be!” Now depart the area, and allow the magick to work. binding spell ( This type of spell works best when cast upon one’s self. This is one way to help rid yourself of negative habits. Habits, fall into that Sub-Conscious group known as programs. For this spell, you will need two small mirrors, a piece of new paper, a pen, and a length of colored ribbon (see the color chart). First decide what habit it is you wish to change. Next, you must word your statement in only positive terms. Example, you want to stop drinking soda. If you Page 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"write, I will not drink soda. When the message goes from your Conscious mind, to your Sub- Conscious mind, the message that the Sub- Conscious mind receives is, I will drink soda. The problem is that your Sub-Conscious mind does not understand the abstract concept of NOT , or any other negative term. So, how do we get around this obstacle? Y ou must word your statement so that you achieve your desired goal in a positive manner. “I will place into my body, only liquids that are healthy .” Once you are clear on the wording, you are ready to cast your binding spell. On the piece of paper, write on one side of the paper your spell. Then turn the paper over and write, it again. Now place the paper between the two mirrors, with the reflective surfaces facing in. T ake the ribbon, start chanting your spell statement. As you do this, visualize your goal and begin wrapping the ribbon around the mirrors. When you reach the end of the ribbon, repeat your spell one last time, and place the bound mirrors upon your altar. It takes forty days to replace a habit. During this time, whenever you are tempted by your habit, recall the words of your spell. binding spell continued love spell  ( So you want to cast a love spell. Well the first thing you need to know is the truth about love magick. Y ou can not force anyone to love someone that they would not naturally be attracted to. A love spell is on the same order as putting an advertisement in the newspaper saying, “Look at me, look at me!” Needed, three cords (one pink, one white, and one violet), each 13 inches long. Tie the three together, while focusing upon your desire for someone to come into your life. In each cord tie seven knots. As you tie each knot, allow your hearts desire to flow into the cord. Once you have tied seven knots in each of the cords, carry the spell object with you until a new love enters your life. Then, place the spell cords someplace safe, or returned them to nature.

It is a series of actions intended to altar awareness, elevate energy , and facilitate events for the achievement of goals, or celebrate personal transitions. It is also a way to honoring the Divine in the form of the seasons, and the Lord & Lady. Most rituals include these procedures: 1) Preparing the space and equipment 2) Preparing of self (cleansing & centering) 3) Asperging the space (with salt-water or smudge stick) 4) Cast the Circle 5) Call the Quarters 6) Invoke the Lord & Lady 7) State your desired goal(s) 8) Raise the Cone of Power 9) Ground the energy with refreshments 10) Dismiss the quarters, and thank the Lord & Lady 11) Open the circle Page 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Grimoire of eclectic Magick t h e a r t o f M a g i c k r i t u a l s   c o n t i n u e d sample ritual The rituals that you write for yourself, will always have the most power. What follows is a sample ritual designed to be a guide for your use. After you have gathered the equipment you will need, and cleaned, or cleared the area you will be using, you need to prepare yourself. This most often is done by taking a ritual bath, donning your robe, or ritual clothing, and spending some quiet time in meditation. This will allow you to be calm, and centered before the ritual begins. Cense the area with incense. Many people use sage. Sage should not be used if anyone who will be at the ritual is pregnant. Frankincense, can also be used, or you can sprinkle the area with a mixture of blessed salt-water. Casting the circle, is done by tracing a circle in the air, above the ground with the Athame (or Wand), while walking deosil (clockwise) around the area. As you do, say , “I conjure thee, O-Circle of power, become a boundary between the world, and the sacred space within.” (In an outdoor circle, some might even use a sword to cut an actual circle into the ground.) One of the problems of being in the Navy, is that in the course of time, references, and source material get lost. The following is my version of a ritual that I first read, sometime before 1996, in Circle Network News. I regret that I do not know the name of the original author. Invocation of the Lord & Lady Maiden bring thy flowers, Mother bring thy child, Grandmother bring thy wisdom, Dana, Hail and Welcome ... Y outh bring thy swiftness, Father bring thy strength, Grandfather bring thy guidance, Cernunnos, Hail and Welcome ... Lord & Lady , enter this circle in Peace, Make an altar of my body , and Grant me Wisdom & Guidance as I perform my rites. Calling the Quarters, is done while standing in the Goddess posture. The wording for this sample ritual, has been taken from the Invocation scene of The Craft. Facing east say , “Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the east. Powers of air and invention. Hear us(me)!” Facing south say , “Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the south. Powers of fire and feeling. Hear us(me)!” Facing west say , “Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the west. Powers of water and intuition. Hear us(me)!” Facing north say , “Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the north. Powers of mother and earth. Hear us(me)!” Looking skyward say , “Aid us(me) in our magical workings ...reason for the ritual....” invoking pentagrams banishing pentagrams Element - Compass Point Relationship Air - East : Fire - South : Water - W est : Earth - North Page 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Grimoire of eclectic Magick t h e a r t o f M a g i c k r i t u a l s   c o n t i n u e d Invoke the Lord & Lady . This is done by naming the deity then glorifying one or more of their attributes. Examples: “Cernunnos, Great Horned One, brother of all creatures wild, and free, we(I) invite you into this circle!” “Dana, Bright Lady, mother of rivers, and mantle of life upon the land, we(I) invite you into this circle!” Stating the desired goal, say “We’r e(I’m) gathered here this night to celebrate ...state the reason..., and to work such magick as we(I) require at this time.” Raising the Cone of Power is done by dancing or chanting. It is at this time that you would celibate the season with ritual drama. This is also the place where you would do healing magick, charge new tools, and the like. Charging the Wand This was inspired by The Vigil of the Wand, as found in The Portal Book by Ian Corrigan. Pass the W and first through Incense, then through Salt, and then through Water. Then say: Creature of wood, be Welcome at my Altar. Be blessed & free from all storms, both in the mortal & the magical realms. Become one with me, and work my will in the worlds of Land, Sea & Sky. Pass the W and through the Spirit Flame. Then say: By the Power of this Holy Fire, Be blessed with Wisdom, Love & Joy . Become one with me and work my will in T ruth and Power. Hold the Wand upright between your palms, and over your heart. Feel the power flow out as you breath life into the Wand. Then say: In the names of Dana & Curnonnus, and by my own spirit, be you Thrice Blessed. Become one with me and work my will. So Mote It Be! Grounding the energy. This can be done with refreshments such as juice & cupcakes, (or if you are of age and inclined, cakes & wine, or ale). Another method of grounding, is the infamous hugging of a tree. The purpose here is to relax, and let the energy raised in ritual dissipate. Dismissing the quarters, and thanking the Lord & Lady ... when all is done, it is time to say farewell. The Lord & Lady: “Dana & Cernunnos, we(I) thank you for joining this circle, and ask that if it is your will, depart now in peace until next we meet. Hail and Farewell!” The Quarters: “O ye guardians of the watchtowers, we(I) thank you for your services, and wish you depart now in peace. Hail and Farewell!” If you used invoking pentagrams to Call the Quarters, you should now use banishing pentagrams to Dismiss the Quarters. Opening the circle. Start in the east and walk widdershins (counter-clockwise) around the circle, chanting ... “May the circle be open, but unbroken. May the peace of the Goddess be ever in your heart.

The truth is, everyone has the ability within them. It is only a matter of choosing to learn how to use your gifts. This book was never designed to teach you that. blood , sex and ritual initiation There are enough dangers in just growing up in the world today . Y our choice of religion should not add to them. In The Craft, the school girls were portrayed as misfits, and outcasts. Although many members of the various pagan belief systems, might fit into those groups, there are just as many , if not more normal well-adjusted members. There are also a number of opportunists who tend to prey upon those who seek this path. Anyone can pick up a book on the occult, and toss a few buzzwords around. And if you sleep with them, they will more then gladly teach you secret powers. Can you say Bull Shit? Sex is a sacred gift, granted to us by the gods. Sex should never be used as barter for knowledge. T rue knowledge, real knowledge is free. It is there for anyone who has the desire, and the eyes to see! If you are of legal age, and want to have sex with someone, that is your choice. No one, and no group have the right to make it for you! If you are not 100% certain that you are doing what is best for you, you have the freedom to find the door. Some T raditions, still practice the Great Rite in the traditional form. There are just as many T raditions that do not have such requirements in their initiations. Find the T radition that meets your needs, and encourages you to grow as an independent person! Magick is after all about freedom! In The Craft, the initiation ritual the girls preform does not involve sex, but they do share a chalice of wine that has drops of their blood in it. At one point in time this may have been an acceptable practice. At this point in time, with the AIDS plague still running uncontrolled in the world, it’s not only unacceptable. It is down right deadly! Magick is about responsibility . Be responsible, don’t take needless risks with your body , or your life! We all find ourselves at crossroads as we go through life. For most of us, the teen years are the greatest crossroad we’ll ever face. Not only does the body go from that of a child, to that of an adult. We also go from having all of our decisions being made for us, to have the freedom to make our own choices. Following a pagan path, is just another one of those choices. It should be made from the heart, with the desire to truly live in harmony with the planet, and all others. T olerance, not power is the true underlaying strength of the pagan path! “Merry meet, and merry part, and merry meet again!” “Merry meet, and merry part, and merry meet again!” Page 20"}]
