Through metaphor, we can only paint a picture. The shapes and colors can only be realized through med- itation on the metaphors and doing the work itself. There is no sub- stitute for the latter, and, while many have not practiced Goetic evocation as classically described, they have evoked \"unawares,\" over and over again, the same powerful forces and demons which have both helped and hindered them. Like many of you I have \"made up\" my own rituals and have given my own names to these forces. At times I have given them proper names such as John, my neighbor, when his T.V. is too loud. At other times I have called these forces mother, friend, the system \"It\" or \"me.\" Sometimes I have benefited from \"calling\" these \"Names\" and sometimes I have suffered. Yet, neither benefit nor pain has caused me to reject the \"howlings\"! and simply seek the comfort of \"High Magick\" alone. If I stand for anything, it is the acceptance of everything, (except, perhaps, for the hypocrisy demonstrated by many magicians and mystics who seek the light by running away from darkness). Goetia is sometimes thought of as a wild card, something that can get out of control, something which expresses the operator's 1 \"Goetia means 'howling'; but is the technical word employed to cover all the operations of that Magick which deals with gross, malignant or unenlightened forces.\"- Aleister Crowley 9"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"10 The I[[ustrated Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • WiCson 11 lower desires to control others and improve his own personal life. And in fact this potential loss of control, this danger, the desire for self improvement and great power is exactly what attracts many people to Goetia while horrifying and repelling others. Many label Goetia as simply evil. Finding evil is a easy job. Just look at your friend, wife, husband, mother, father or for that matter the \"guy\" next door. The practice of Goetia is that other guy, something dark, mysterious and power- ful, something which tells the world that you are interested in yourself, interested in mastery as well as surrender (see Chapter Two in Sex Magick, Tantra and Tarot: The Way Of The Secret Lover, New Falcon Publications, 1996 for an explanation of sur- render and mastery). Those who have disowned themselves and fear themselves often consider Goetic practices to be evil of the worst kind. Goetia is often thought of as an invitation to madness, the releasing of devouring and frightful forces. What Goetia is-is the releasing of yourself from your own fears and illusions by direct confrontation. Goetic evocation is an invitation to flirt with the ambiguous rela- tionship of \"mind\" and \"matter.\" Remember, no one knows the true nature or actions of either and thus all arguments as to the \"reality\" of Goetic spirits are speculative and open to revision. The question remains: What is evil? Some experts believe it is the intentional doing of harm without redemption. While this defi- nition might provide these experts with a sense of comfort it pro- vides me with little. It is too easy to play with words and ideas. For example according to this definition, Hitler might not be consid- ered evil since some people believe that without his persecution of the Jews, Israel would not have been founded in the late forties. There is always some \"good\" which our \"cause\" and \"order\" crazed mind can find to rationalize or justify a horrible or unfortu- nate event. Evil is an \"externalization\" and \"objectification\" of something fearful, horrifying, or .different. Evil can be a label for something as simple as a person or an object that frustrates us. Evil is pain. Evil is the enemy. Evil is the Gods of other men. Evil is the night terrors. Evil is the overwhelming feeling of falling apart. Yet all these images are non-sense. Evil like other ideas exists because we as humans exist. Nature knows not Evil, neither Good, nor for that matter Law. These are creations of the human mind, \"explana- tions\" which help us quiet the \"terrors of the night.\" The human mind requires the belief in \"its\" idea of \"order\" for the sale pur- poses of the human mind. Thus the nature of evil is the human mind. Each of us are full of doubts, frustrations, fears and anxieties. These demons of the soul are the hidden parts of our self. They are the disowned self, much like Goetia is the often disowned part of Magick. We normally don't present our dark side to others. Rarely, will anyone tell you their weak points let alone their deepest con- cerns. It is much easier and frequently less painful to find darkness outside of oneself. What I present to the world, or for that matter what anyone pre- sents, is at best a well-crafted ideal image, something desired, hoped for, something my brain and culture have helped create. OUf mask is an illusion, a piece of the truth, a necessary one, but none the less only a piece of the truth. CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND GOETIA EVOCATION Psychology, particularly therapeutic psychology, deals with people's fears and doubts. Psychologists label many of these fears as pathology. Psychologists have carefully followed in the foot- steps of the Priest, who in his non-scientific but simple way labelled these things as evil or demonic possession. The average clinical psychologist is no more scientific than the priest. In the depths of the psychotherapeutic cave, the therapist assists the patient in evoking the rejected and hidden parts of his psyche. The greatest danger for the therapist, and for the patient, is the therapist's counter-transference. When this counter-transference remains unconscious or gets \"out of control,\" therapy becomes dangerous and ineffective. The complexes (demons) of both the therapist and the patient are mixing in an archaic cauldron. All sorts of dangers are thought to be lurking. Sex becomes a strong"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"12 The If£ustrateef Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifson J .,3 possibility; so are violent outbreaks. Remember, these dangers are thought to be a result of the therapist's (the operator) losing control of the contents of his own unconscious processes, idealized fan- tasies, unfulfilled wishes and disowned attributes. Once this hap- pens, it is believed that both the therapist and patient are adrift on a stormy sea in a sinking lifeboat. The horrors and fears of counter-transference are so great that many State Laws explicitly prohibit \"dual relationships\" between therapist and patient.; i.e., the therapist and patient may not be- come involved in relationships outside the safety of the therapeutic model. Dual relationships are thought of as a crossing of role boundaries between the therapist and patient. It is believed that strict boundaries are necessary between the patient and therapist in order for the patient's cure. This is based on the theory that the patient's disease was caused by the breaking of proper boundaries in childhood. The psychotherapeutic situation contains boundaries, strict ones set down by law, historical precedent, and theory. The therapist becomes a mirror for the patient upon which the patient's highest aspirations and ideals as well as his disowned \"shadowy\" qualities can be projected. It is believed by some that the \"working through\" of both the \"dark\" and \"ideal\" illusions are fundamental to the patient seeing himself as well as others cor- rectly, instead of the images and distorted fantasies originating and fixed in childhood. The disappointment the patient feels when his illusions are crushed can be overwhelming. When his illusions of the therapist are crushed, his own self-illusions are threatened. The patient is both angry and depressed. If the therapist is a good \"operator,\" he knows how to help the patient \"crush\" his illusions. He helps the patient free himself from his projections and splits. He knows how to help the patient realize that the therapist has both \"good\" and \"bad\" qualities and that these diverse qualities can reside in the same person at the same time. The therapist does not have to be worshipped or rejected. Either/Or is the disease. Once the patient realizes this, he also \"knows\" that the same truth applies to him- self. He is neither his ideal nor his darkness. These obvious realiza- tions, however, cannot occur in a cool and objective way; for reso- lution to occur it often manifests in the heat, and sometimes exhaustion, of intense emotion. Power and force are necessary, and whether this manifests in extreme feeling or behavior or simply in moods and \"neurotic\" tests matters little. It matters only that they must manifest themselves, and the operator, by the definition of the situation, must stimulate them and in some way control them. He often stimulates them by breaking a taboo either in fact or by implication. He often teases and bribes the patient to be \"naughty.\" Sometimes the patient is the operator and the therapist is the receiver. In fact, these roles change, but not in a simple way. The therapist sometimes is \"blank\"-just receiving from the patient. At other times, the therapist is \"active\" while the patient receives images and conveys them back to the therapist in disguised forms. What you have just read may sound contradictory: strict bound- aries, deliberate violations of boundaries, the situation itself elicit- ing tests of boundaries, firm boundaries, fluid boundaries. In some sense it all sounds quite \"crazy:\" projection, illusion, reality, boundaries, violations of trust freeing a person from the prison of his soul. Yet while sounding strange and often unscientific, if per- formed properly the desired results can occur. And what again are the desired results? One person helping another achieve what he most desperately wants and at the same time most desperately fears: control over his own life, freedom from devastating and repetitive illusions, freedom from reliving the past over and over again in the present. Real therapy teaches the patient how to em- brace the whole of life, rejecting nothing, seeing .the limitations of his ideals as well as the utility of his weaknesses. Real therapy teaches the art of violation, the breaking of taboos, opening the gates of both heaven and hell. Real therapy teaches style. TABOOS Boundaries can be thought of as taboos. (See Taboo: Sex, Reli- gion and Magic, New Falcon Publications, 2000.)

Taboos are \"dirty.\" People who break taboos are thought of as dirty, evil people. Yet, in our society is it not the \"dirty\" the dark which attracts attention? The garbage collector is highly paid for removing the leftovers of living. The bank clerk who handles hundreds of thousands of \"dirty\" dollars is paid less than the garbage collector. What is the nature of dirt, the common, which at the same time is valued and despised by so many? Money can do the bidding of anyone who has it. Money itself is only a shared illusion. It has no value except what people give it and it has no power except by what people do with it. The fluidity, mal- leability and indifference of money gives it a power unlike almost any other power in the world. Money sets boundaries and destroys them. Money itself doesn't care. And in this sense moneyis similar to the Goetia demons. They will work for anyone who knows how to use them. This is one of the horrors people attribute to Goetic workings. You \"don't have to be respectable\" for Goetia to work for you. Unlike other magical workings there is no implication that the operator has to be \"good\" and \"holy\" to achieve results. This idea in itself violates our model of \"right\" and \"wrong,\" \"just\" and \"unjust.\" In the Goetic world like in the real world the \"bad\" can and do prosper. Thus our belief in the moral order of the Universe appears violated by the simple existence of Spirits who will do the bidding of anyone. Goetic evocation is the rejected \"less respectable\" side of mag- ick. It is the work of the garbage collector. But it is also the most intimate side of the magick. It teaches the establishment of bound- aries, of testing, of bribing, of lying and deceit. It provides the operator and the receiver with visions, suggestions and insights. It actualizes the hidden, the dark, the greedy, the needy, the powerful and beautiful. Goetic evocation can be very disappointing, sometimes even horrifying, but it can never be boring. Unlike a child who deter- mines the value of its knowledge by the approval or disapproval of a \"higher authority\" we learn the value of our Goetic work by the success or failure of our own work. Goetic Spirits are not the mas .. ter of the magician but his servant. We do not rely on the \"Spirits\" per se to tell us that we did well. Goetia work is more \"scientific\" than other forms of magick in terms of our ability to measure its effects and, to some extent, replicate our results. Goetic workings can also be potentiated by the use of hypnosis and sex. Trance and \"exhaustion\" resulting from sexual ecstasy are perfect methods for preparing the mind to receive more meaningful and powerful information. In this book on Goetia, we have provided the student with a sim- ple to use text on how to begin and become expert at Goetia evo- cation. We have included images of the Goetia Spirits, not to limit the student, but to stimulate his or her imagination. We have orga- nized the text in such a way that the student doesn't have to flip through dozens of pages to find what he wants or needs. Equally important, we have provided a technique for the sexual working of the Goetia Spirits. This is a very powerful and sensual method. I have no doubt that some readers will be terrified and horrified at the potential power these techniques will release. We feel, however, that if you desire to practice magick you should practice it to its fullest. Safeguards have been provided, and the real dangers lie more in the mind than in the use of the methods."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"QCHAPTER m:WO The Initiated Interpretation of Ceremonial Magick by Aleister Crowley :i( t is loftily amusing to the student of Magical literature who ;.lJ is not quite a fool-and rare is such a combination !-. to note the criticism directed by the Philistine against the citadel of his science. Truly, since our childhood has ingrained into us not only literal belief in the Bible, but also substantial belief in Alf Laylah wa Laylah (A Thousand and One Arabian Nights), and only adolescence can cure us, we are only too liable, in the rush and energy of dawning manhood, to overturn roughly and rashly both these classics, to regard them both on the same level, as interesting documents from the standpoint of folk-lore and anthropology, and as nothing more. Even when we learn that the Bible, by a profound and minute study of the text, may be forced to yield up Qabalistic arcana of cosmic scope and importance, we are too often slow to apply a similar restorative to the companion volume, even if we are the luck holders of Burton's veritable edition. To me, then, it remains to raise the Alf Laylah wa Laylah into its proper place once more.

These consist of: (1) Sight. . The circle, square, triangle, vessels, lamps robes, Imple- ments, etc. (2) Sound. The invocations. (3) Smell. The perfumes. 2 This, incidentally, is perhaps the greatest argument we possess, pushed to its l\" x t reme, against the Advaitist theories. \\ Thought is a secretion of the brain (Weissmann). Consciousness is a function of the brain (Huxley). (4) Taste. The Sacraments. (5) Touch. As under (1). (6) Mind. The combination of all these and reflection on their significance. These unusual impressions (1-5) produce unusual brain-changes; hence their summary (6) is of unusual kind. Its projection back into the apparently phenomenal world is therefore unusual. Herein then consists the reality of the operations and effects of ceremonial magic.t and I conceive that the apology is ample, as far as the \"effects\" refer only to those phenomena which appear to the magician himself, the appearance of the spirit, his conversation, possible shocks from imprudence, and so on, even to ecstasy on the one hand, and death or madness on the other. But can any of the effects described in this our book Goetia\" be obtained, and if so, can you give a rational explanation of the cir- cumstances? Say you so? I can, and will. The spirits of the Goetia are portions of the human brain. Their seals therefore represent (Mr. Spencer's projected cube) methods of stimulating or regulating those particular spots (through the eye). The names of God are vibrations calculated to establish: (a) General control of the brain. (Establishment of functions rel- ative to the subtle world.) (b) Control over the brain in detail. (Rank or type of the Spirit.) (c) Control of one special portion. (Name of the Spirit.) The perfumes aid this through smell.

I need not enter into more particular discussion of these points; the intelligent reader can easily fill in what is lacking. If, then, I say, with Solomon: \"The Spirit Cimieries teaches logic;\" what I mean is: \"Those portions of my brain which subserve the logical faculty may be stimulated and developed by following out the processes called 'The Invocation of Cimieries.' \" And this is a purely materialistic rational statement; it is indepen- dent of any objective hierarchy at all. Philosophy has nothing to say; and Science can only suspend judgment, pending a proper and methodical investigation of the facts alleged. Unfortunately, we cannot stop there. Solomon promises us that we can (1) obtain information; (2) destroy our enemies; (3) under- stand the voices of nature; (4) obtain treasure; (5) heal diseases, etc. I have taken these five powers at random; considerations of space forbid me to explain all. (1) Brings up facts from sub-consciousness. (2) Here we come to an interesting fact. It is curious to note the contrast between the noble means and the apparently vile ends of magical rituals. The latter are disguises for sublime truths. \"To destroy our enemies\" is to realize the illusion of duality, to excite compassion. (Ah! Mr. Waite, the world of Magic is a mirror, wherein who sees muck is muck.) (3) A careful naturalist will understand much from the voices of the animals he has studied long. Even a child knows the dif- ference of a eat's miauling and purring. The faculty may be greatly developed. (4) Business capacity may be stimulated.

There is no effect which is truly and necessarily miraculous. Our Ceremonial Magic fines down, then, to a series of minute, though of course empirical, physiological experiments, and whoso will carry them through intelligently need not fear the result. I have all the health, and treasure, and logic, I need; I have no time to waste. \"There is a lion in the way.\" For me these practices are useless; but for the benefit of others less fortunate I give them to the world, together with this explanation of, and apology for, them. I trust that the explanation will enable many students who have hitherto, by a puerile objectivity in their view of the question, obtained no results, to succeed; that the apology may impress upon our scornful men of science that the study of the bacillus should give place to that of the baculum, the little to the great-how great one only realizes when one identifies the wand with the Mahalin- gam, up which Brahma flew at the rate of 84,000 yojanas a second for 84,000 mahakalpasv, down which Vishnu flew at the rate of 84,000 croces of yojanas a second for 84,000 crores ofmaha- kalpas-yet neither reached an end.

On a scale of spiri- tual practices one might find Goetia sandwiched somewhere between \"Pacts with the Devil\" and \"addiction to the Ouija board.\" This attitude is understandable. After all, Goetia is the intentional conjuration of spiritual beings who are, by definition, Fallen Angels, Evil Spirits and Demons! From their infernal abodes these naughty Spirits are called forth to act as personal servants to the Goetic magician to extend his power and execute his will on Earth. The magician must be ever vigilant to the wiles of the Spirits. If he is unskilled or loses control even for an instant, he runs the risk of being obsessed, possessed or even destroyed. This sounds uncomfortably like Black Magick. Such behavior is certainly beneath the altruistic purity of purpose that characterize the quest and disciplines of High Magick and can serve only to bring out the lowest qualities of the practitioner's character ... 23"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"24 The I[[ustrateef Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifsolt 25 So goes the argument against Goetic evocation and, so far as it goes, it is a point well taken. Yes, the Spirits in question are of the \"infernal\" variety. But exactly what does that mean? If we embrace, for a moment, the popular nomenclature of High Magick, \"infernal\" relates to the sub~onscious stratum of the human psyche. Spirits inhabiting these regions would then be the personifications of powers or energies that lie buried in our subconscious minds-qualities of our con- sciousness that we have disowned. They are Fallen because they have slipped from the conscious control of the deity-ourselves. Yes, they are dangerous because while they remain unmastered they can surface unbidden and wreak all the havoc modern psy- chology blames on \"things hidden in the subconscious mind.\" To the charge that such practices bring out the worst qualities in th~ ~agician's ch~ra~ter, t~e Goetic practitioner pleads \"guilty,\" pomtmg out that this IS precisely the purpose of this variety of evo- cation. If these disowned qualities are not brought forth, identified and controlled, the magician, like the rest of humanity, is doomed to be at the mercy and the caprice of his own subconscious demons, never being allowed the opportunity to subdue these denizens of his psychic menagerie. But are the Spirits of the Goetia simply subjective components of the magician's mind, or is there really an independent objective quality to their natures? This fundamental question may never re- ceive a satisfactory answer due to the fact that no one really under- stands the nature of \"matter.\" But one thing is certain: one who has never experienced a Goetic Evocation is not qualified to voice even the most educated opinion on the subject. It is one thing to be ~ell-rea~ on a subject; it is quite another to be part of the subject Itself. It IS an unfortunate fact that there are many individuals who make magick their life without making their life magick. Even the most talented and brilliant expounders of the Art sometimes lose sight o~ this and focus instead on historical or technical aspects of the subject to such a degree that they ignore completely its rele- vance to their daily life and happiness. In light of this, I feel it would be helpful to relate the circum- stances surrounding my first Goetic evocation. I beg the reader's att~ntion to what follows because I feel that it contains many of the major components necessary for a successful Goetic Evocation. (I have omitted the name of my former \"magick teacher\" as it would be recognized by a great many readers.) WITH MY BACK AGAINST A WALL It.~as 1975 and I had never been so desperate in my life. My decision to end a \"successful\" fourteen year career in music had been one of life and death-mine. It was either continue a lifestyle that was destroying my health and my relationship with my wife and young son, or risk not being able to support them. I was trained for nothing practical. Even my college education, such as it was, was as a Drama major. The pocket change I was still earning from recording royalties and guitar lessons wasn't enough to feed us let alone pay the rent and the bills. I had no job, no car, no money, no prospects ... no hope. One of the few bright spots that characterized this period was my discovery of the writings of Aleister Crowley and my involvement the disciplines of ceremonial magick, Since the mid-60's I had been a student of Eastern Mysticism and Western Hermeticism, and my interests had finally brought me into contact with a magical society that I had believed long extinct. I passionately involved myself in this group and subsequently became the student of one of its senior officers. A charming woman in her fifties, she continually impressed me with what I perceived to be her balanced, logical approach to the subject of magick. Her teacher had been a personal student of Aleister Crowley and had even been a resident at his (in)famous Abbey of Thelema in Cefalu Sicily in the 1920's. I was thrilled to ~e a link in such an historic magical chain and my spiritual prac- tices became the entire focus of my life. Periodically my teacher reviewed my diaries and we maintained constant correspondence. I also visited her as often as I could."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"26 The I[[ustratecf Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifson 27 However, my deteriorating situation on the material .plane was a source of major anxiety and the distraction inevitably began to affect my ability to concentrate on my \"spiritual\" practices. What was the use of all this study if I couldn't use it in a practi- cal way to improve my life? My teacher cautioned me not to mix my planes. \"If you need a job, go out and get a job.\" she wrote. \"Learn to walk before you attempt to run.\" Performing magick to help get a job was, in her words, \"low magick\" and would distract from the Great Work that I was pledged to perform. I could not make it clear to her that I was trying to improve my situation by normal means, but I also felt the need to magically \"lubricate\" the situation. Obviously there was a great stumbling block before me and, after all, didn't the esoteric Wisdom of the Ages teach us to look first in ourselves for such obstacles? I was familiar with The Lesser Key of Solomon-The Goetia 7- and it seemed to me that many of the seventy-two Spirits (if one considered them actual entities, capable of effecting change on the material plane) could provide such help. I wanted to perform a Goetic evocation for the purpose of improving the conditions of my material life. This suggestion to my teacher evoked in her an almost hysterical response. She told me in no uncertain terms that I was not ready to practice any form of Goetic evocation. She stressed that only magi- cians who had already achieved the highest levels of illumination were qualified to do so. \"Once you achieve the Knowledge and Conversation of your Holy Guardian Angel you will see all of this as unnecessary.\" But how could I obtain the mental and emotional equilibrium necessary to achieve such lofty spiritual heights while my life remained so screwed up? Is it required by the Gods that illumina- tion comes only to the illuminated? 7 The Book of the Goetia of Solomon the King Translated into the English Tongue by a Dead Hand and Adorned with Divers Other Matters Germane Delightful to the Wise, the Whole Edited, Verified, Introduced and Commented by Aleister Crowley-Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth, Boleskine, Foyers, Inverness, Scotland, 1904.

I enjoyed the work very much and kept a detailed magical diary and dream records. I constructed and consecrated my magical weapons, mixed the Holy Oil of Abramelin and memo- rized the recommended texts. My teacher seemed pleased with my progress. By the Fall of 1976, my situation in the \"real\" world had degen- erated terribly. I didn't have a car or a telephone and that made job hunting difficult. The temporary positions I did manage to secure were so far away that what little they paid was all but taken up by the expense of getting there. To say that I was distracted by my anxiety would be a cruel understatement. My self esteem was at an all-time low and I began to entertain thoughts too dark to relate. My back was against the wall. As a last resort and against my teacher's instructions, I decided to perform a Goetic evocation with the expressed purpose of turning my life around and achieving some level of mastery over my exis- tence. I wrote in my diary, \"I must succeed, because the conse- quences of failure at this point are unthinkable.\" I turned my attention to the only Goetic text available to me at that time. I went down the list of the Spirits and their attributes and settled on # 55: 29"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"30 The I((ustratd Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifson 31 <'l&ROBAS \\lChe Fifty-fifth Spirit is Orobas. He is a great and mighty Prince, appearing at first like a horse; but after the command of the Exorcist he puts on the image of a man. His office is to discover all things past, present, and to come; also to give Dignities, and Prelacies, and the favor of friends and of foes. He gives true answers of divinity, and of the creation of the world. He is very faithful unto the Exorcist, and will not allow him to be tempted of any Spirit. He governs 20 Legions of Spirits. Orobas seemed ideal for my needs. First I lacked the \"dignity\" to properly care for myself and my family. (At the time I had no idea what \"prelacies\" meant.) Second, in order to pull my life together I would need the favor of both friends and foes. Third, because of my studies, I needed confidence in my divinatory abilities and a ~ood understanding of the Holy Qabalah. Finally I needed a Spirit In whom I could trust. Orobas seemed like the perfect Magical side-kick. Orobas it would be. Next I had to come to grips with the Temple set up, equipment and the method of evocation. The Temple was easy. I could use my son's bedroom (the only bedroom in our little apartment). Using thin masking tape, I c~eated a circle about nine feet in diameter on the floor. Upon the CIrcle I placed the Holy Names; for me these included the names from the Thelemic Pantheon: Nuit, Hadit, Ra-Hoor Khuit, Baba- lon, Therion. I made the Triangle from posterboard and enclosed it with what I felt were appropriate names (Thelema, Agape and Abrahadabra) . The equipment was improvised and not at all the glamorous magical accouterments I had always pictured: an inexpensive Indian incense burner smoked in the Triangle near a paper facsim- ile of the seal of Orobas; I scratched the same figure upon the medallion that hung from my neck (the flip side engraved with the pentagram of Solomon); a cup of water for purification; a candle for consecration; Oil of Abramelin to anoint myself and the Tem- ple, and, of course, my magick book. I had a real problem with the conjurations as they appeared in The Lesser Key of Solomon. I was sure that it would be unneces- sary for me to mindlessly parrot the tedious series of conjurations precisely as they are written in the text. The endless intonations are obviously intended to do two things: (1) reinforce the operator's belief that he has a \"divine right\" to call forth and control the Spirit and (2) put the operator in an altered state of consciousness whereby he can see and communicate with the Spirit. I was confi- dent that I could achieve both these states without the tiresome archaic language and the references to Old Testament characters for whom I had neither emotional attachment nor respect. I resolved to simply perform a thorough banishing, then open the Temple with Crowley's Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia (see Chapter Seven), which I had already memorized as part of the cere- monies of the consecration of my magical weapons. Then, \"intoxi- cated\" by the Barbarous Words of Evocation, I would simply con- centrate upon the Triangle and call forth Orobas extempore. The Charge was to be a simple one. Orobas was to immediately do whatever was necessary to help me gain control over my life. I needed to attain the dignity to safeguard the well being of myself and my wife and child; Orobas was to remain as my familiar, exe- cuting my orders without bringing harm to me or my loved ones. In return I would be a kind master and promise, if he remained obedi- ent and faithful, to exalt his seal and his name and redeem his spirit even as my spirit is redeemed. All being ready in the bedroom Temple, I prepared myself to evoke Orobas. It had been unseasonably warm all day and by late afternoon (when I was ready to operate) the Temple was very hot. After a long ceremonial bath I put on my robe with the obligatory \"By the figurative mystery of this holy vestment ... \" and took my position in the circle."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"32 The I[[ustrateeC Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifson 3J I removed the stopper from the vial of Oil of Abramelin (by tradition the most powerful of Holy Oils, made from 8 parts cinna- mon oil, 4 parts myrrh oil, 2 parts oil of galangal, 7 parts olive oil). I anointed the top of my head, then my forehead, throat, heart, solar plexus, navel and groin areas. Wherever it touched my skin, the oil burned like fire and made me excitedly conscious of my psychic centers. With my Almond Wand I performed the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram then proceeded with the Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia. This completed, I began to concentrate upon the seal in the Triangle and \"call\" Orobas. I don't know what I expected. Nothing was happening. I called Orobas again, this time more forcefully. Still nothing. Disappoint- ment began to settle upon me and I started to feel all the frustration that had brought me to this point. I became impatient and angry. I pointed my Wand toward the Triangle and shouted, \"get in the Triangle God damn it or I'll burn your little-ass seal to a crisp. If you aren't for me you're against me and I would just as soon anni- hilate you than argue with you.\" For the first time in my life I had \"someone\" to vent all my anger and frustration upon. It felt good. It felt very good to yell at and threaten someone or something I held responsible for all my ills. I don't know how long I raved at that empty cardboard Triangle but suddenly I felt silly. I stopped and took a deep breath. I felt my heart pounding in my throat and I was covered with sweat. In the hot, heavy calm something was happening. I didn't see anything but something definitely was in the room with me. It was like the feeling you get when you are awakened from a nap sensing you are not alone, only to discover that your dog is staring at you. It was in the Triangle. I didn't see it with my eyes like a cartoon or hologram. I saw it like one \"sees\" an idea-as if it were pro- jected upon the inside back of my skull: a little horse with large sad eyes staring at me like an abused pack animal. Orobas. I now felt self-conscious, almost embarrassed. Its presence was as objectively perceptible as if another conscious Being stood before me. A Being with an independent existence and feelings. I sensed also that it unquestionably resented being confined in the Triangle. So stunned was I that for a moment I forgot everything. I com- pletely lost my attitude of superior indignation. Now I was fearful that I would be unable to control the situation. \"As long as I stare at the Triangle with all my concentrated will,\" I thought, \"I will stay in control.\" No sooner had this thought crossed my mind than a bead of sweat from my brow ran over the bridge of my nose and into my right eye. I blinked several times, then rubbed both eyes with the fingers of my left hand. Suddenly my eyes began to bum so badly that I couldn't keep them open. I instantly realized what I had done. The sweat from my forehead was saturated with Oil of Abramelin. My fingers were covered in it. I was rubbing concen- trated cinnamon oil into my own eyes! The pain was excruciating and getting worse by the second. I was completely blinded. I panicked. I couldn't go on with the evocation like this nor could I risk further breach of procedure by breaking the Circle. The old rage returned. With my eyes squeezed tightly together I turned toward the Triangle and spat a mindless curse at Orobas. I blamed this all on him and vowed to arrange an eternity of confinement and torment if he didn't remain in the Triangle. I knew that I had no choice but to blindly find my way to the bathroom and wash my eyes. Then the most extraordinary thing happened. I could see. I could see everything. Even with my eyes on \"fire\" and pressed closed, I could \"see\" the entire Temple. I saw the incense burning; I saw the Circle; I could even see myself as if from behind and above; I saw Orobas standing in the Triangle. I was inso much pain that I wasn't at all impressed with this new \"magical vision.\" I had to do something quickly about my eyes. I pointed my wand at the Spirit and barked \"stay!\" Orobas immedi- ately reclined and remained motionless and peaceful as if he were the little donkey in a nativity scene. I left the Circle and ran to the bathroom adjacent to the bedroom. I quickly pulled my robe over my head and got into the shower.

I felt better now-relieved-as if I experienced a discharge of energy that had been knotted up inside me all my life. Now I couldn't wait to finish the operation. Back in the Circle all the nervousness that I felt earlier was gone. With cold-blooded resolve I picked up my Wand and addresse.d Orobas once again. This time there was a clear two-way cornmuru- cation. I mentally spoke my words and \"heard\" Orobas' response simultaneously: \"I called you forth in good faith. Why did you bum my eyes?\" \"Y ou burned your own eyes. Only an idiot would put cinnamon oil on his forehead in this heat.\" \"If you ever do anything like ~at ag.ain I will destroy you.\" \" \"Then I apologize for that WhICh I did not do. Why am I here? \"Is everything the book tells me about you true?\" \"It is ... and more.\" \"Then I tell you, my life is crap. I need to get control of it.

I want to see some positive sign today that you are ~orking fo~ m~.\" . \"But today is too soon.\" Orobas said calmly. It IS unfair to ask me to work so fast. Give me at least two weeks to show you a sign.\" \"He's right.\" I thought to myself. \"I am asking too much. Maybe I should give him more time. If I don't see any results today, then I will have to admit that this operation is a failure. How will that make me feel? I'm depressed already. I don't know if I could take one more failure. Failure in life, failure in Magick. Maybe I should give him a month-no-six months-yes-six months-some- thing's bound to happen in six months-then I'll be able to say the operation was a success ... \" I stopped myself in mid-sentence. These are not my thoughts, they're his! This is the classic negotiation process of the Spirits. This is how the magician could be talked into pacts and other such silliness. If I allowed him to go on he could talk me into anything and make me think it was my own idea! It was so subtle yet so obvious. I had to regain control of the conversation. \"No! No more time. I need to see positive proof you are fulfilling your charge and I need to see it today. If I don't, I swear by these red eyes that I will recast the Circle and Triangle for the purpose of burning your seal and annihilating you. On the other hand, if you fulfill your charge I will exalt you and your name. Your seal will live in metal or stone for a thousand years, and you will be re- deemed even as I am redeemed. Is that clear?\" \"It is clear.\" I sent him off with an ad lib license to depart and when I could no longer sense his presence I banished the Temple and disassem- bled the Circle and Triangle. The entire procedure took a little over an hour. My wife and son were amusing themselves in the living room and were completely unaware of the adventure I had just experienced on the other side of the door. \"What happened to your eyes?\" was the only question I was forced to deal with and the entire event almost immediately took on the dimensions of a distant memory. I got a drink of water and stretched out on the floor to digest what had just happened when we were all startled by the rumblings of what was obviously an old car with a very bad muffler. It"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"36 The I[[ustrated Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifson 37 coughed and choked to a stop directly in front of our apartment and the driver got out and pounded loudly on our door. It was \"Mad Bob,\" one of our oldest and dearest friends. He had been out of the country for several years so we were surprised and delighted to see him again. After surviving his lusty bear-hugs we asked him to come in but he said he couldn't stay. He reached into his pocket and took out the keys to his jalopy and tossed them on the couch. \"The car is yours! I'm going to Guatemala. I need to be in Long Beach in a half an hour, give me a ride.\" If this wasn't the sign I asked Orobas for it was damned good facsimile. We got into my \"new\" car and drove to Long Beach where I dropped Mad Bob off to begin his Guatemala adventure. My adventure was just beginning as well. On the way home, I converted the pennies in the ashtray to a quarter and bought a local newspaper. At home I combed the \"Help Wanted\" columns and circled three entry-level positions at companies I could now reach in my car. The following day I applied in person at all three and was hired by the third. Three months and three promotions later, I found myself in the engineer- ing department of a large medical device laboratory making a \"dig- nified\" wage. During that same period, because of a chain of extra- ordinary events, I was consecrated Bishop of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica. This \"Prelacy\" was entirely unexpected and has become one of the most important aspects of my adult life. Soon after getting my job, I cast the Circle and Triangle and called Orobas again. This time to thank him and tell him I recog- nized his faithful execution of my charge. I engraved his sigil beautifully upon an attractive tin plate that, barring a direct nuclear hit or a supernova of the Sun, will last a thousand years. I have called up many of the 72 Spirits over the ensuing years but I have troubled Orobas only a handful of times since (only in times of absolute desperation and after I have exhausted all other means of helping myself), He remains a loyal familiar and has never yet failed in his ability to fulfill his instructions. The reader can invoke coincidence and argue that all the events subsequent to my evocation were in the process of happening to me anyway. And to this I will not argue. But as much as my left brain interprets such phenomena subjectively-in the terms of psy- chology, my right brain will always be convinced that there is an objective and independent reality to the Spirits. As a matter of fact, some of the most competent and experienced Goetic magicians today dismiss the purely psychological explana- tion as naive. They point out examples of evocations characterized by objects being moved or thrown across the room, power surges, or electric or electronic devices activated or deactivated, and even instances of the Spirit (operating on the magician's instructions) \"appearing\" before third parties who are unaware of the operation. Regardless of which theory you embrace, the fact remains that individuals continue to experience perceptible changes in their lives that are identical to the changes they wish to affect by Goetic evocation. I confess that not every evocation I have performed has been as successful as the Orobas working. On several occasions the \"disobedient Spirit\" necessitated several conjurations (complete with threats, curses and sigil torture) before the desired result was achieved. Some evocations, I have to admit, have been dismal fail- ures. But even they have yielded much important information. Asa matter of fact, I have learned more from the disasters than the tri- umphs because by reviewing my notes of these events I have been able to draw a profile of what is necessary for success: 1. Justification. Is this evocation necessary? Do I deserve the desired object of the operation? Have I done everything I can on the material plane to achieve this result? Or am I lying to myself about my motives and needs? You must be completely convinced that your demands are abso- lutely justified. (And don't think we are invoking the great demon \"morality\" here. An unnecessary motive is an 'unworthy motive- pure and simple) When you are truly justified in your demands then you have the momentum of the entire universe behind you."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"38 The I[[ustrateef Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifson 39 2. Emotion. Unless there is an emotional link to the desired result of the operation, the magician is not tapping that strata of himself (or the spiritual world) where the Spirits of the Goetia reside. The first time you really see a Goetic Spirit you will feel like you have pulled it out of your gut and thrown it in the Triangle This is why evocations for the sake of experiment or entertain- ment seldom achieve satisfactory results and operations of despera- tion or profound personal need often do. 3. Will. It is not enough to be emotionally charged concerning the object of the operation if you are not prepared to do anything about it. The ceremony of evocation must be the unambiguous expression of your absolute Will to effect this change and your willingness to plumb the depths of Hell to see that it is done. 4. Courage. \"Fear is failure and the forerunner of failure.\" and Goetic evocations can be very frightening indeed. But if you are justified in your need; if it means so much to you that you are charging the ceremony with pure, raw emotion; if all this is truly your Will-then courage will become your impregnable Circle. By the same token cowardice will be your undoing. If it is truly your Will to injure your enemy, why go to the trouble to perform a Goetic Evocation when it would be much more effective \"magick\" to simply confront the person and punch them in the nose. If you think you are going to escape the consequences of this act by send- ing a Goetic Spirit to do it for you may be unpleasantly surprised. A WARNING We have also observed, it is sad to say, that the efficacy of the Art does not always manifest in a positive way in every practition- er's life. Often, either because of inherent character flaws or pre- existing pathologies, the \"Spirits\" end up running the magician in- stead of the other way around. It is easy to see that of all branches of ceremonial magick Goetic evocation is among the most likely to be abused, misused and misunderstood. In retrospect I' now see why my teacher was so reluctant to' encourage me as a young student to experiment with the Goetia. In her long career she had seen more Goetic disasters than successes and had chosen, probably wisely, to avoid the system altogether. Often immature dabblers, realizing how easy and effective evo- cation can be, forego all other aspects of magick including the all important quest for the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. They make Goetia the centerpiece of their magi- cal lives and gather together impressionable, weak-willed individ- uals to form a \"lodge.\" Impressed by phenomenon that the \"master\" can easily produce, these individuals often become more his victims than his students. Gone unchecked these relationships eventually become that of master and slave. Unfortunately sincere students often base their entire opinion of ceremonial magick by the pathetic and sophomoric shenanigans of such groups. The Operator-Receiver technique (usually done with a Magick Mirror in the Triangle) is a very effective and historically valid method of evocation. We feel, however, that the reader is well advised not to seek preliminary Goetic instruction from a group or from individuals who offer to \"operate\" an evocation while you \"receive\" the vision. Although this technique is very effective, unless you have absolute confidence in the motives and mental health of your \"operator\" you are better off working alone or with a trusted and willing partner of your choice. The exercises of sexual evocation included later in the book are to be done by two individuals who know and trust each other inti- mately. Individuals who use Sex Magick, Goetic evocation or indeed, any \"magical\" lures as \"pick up\" techniques are all but shouting to the world they are unable to get a sex partner any other way. These are the last people on earth from whom anyone should want to be taught Magick."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"<!CHAPTER jf IVE History If the eye could see the demons that people the universe, existence would be impossible. - Talmud, Berakot, 6 ~ he format of Goetic evocation contains perhaps the most WI colorful and recognizable elements of any type of Western ceremonial magick.

This is the stuff of \"Sword and Sorcerer\" movies. Yet this is precisely the method, and it has come down to us in a most extraordinary way. Sixteenth and seventeenth Century Europe abounded with a myriad of practitioners of the magical arts who, for the most part, were inspired by the colorful images of Middle-Eastern magic. We must keep in mind that for many years much of Iberian Peninsula was occupied by the Moslems. Ironically, even though Islamic law dictates strict proscriptions against unorthodox spiri- tual practices, the occupation forces tolerated a handful of Spanish communities where a certain level of spiritual freedom flourished.

This 41"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"42 Tne IfCustrated Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifson 43 period was to profoundly influence the Renaissance and subse- quently the entire \"Hermetic\" traditions of Western Civilization. It is from this tradition that the concept of \"Solomonic\" magic was developed. Spirits (genies) trapped in bottles, magic carpets, great treasures protected by demons-all reminiscent of A Thou- sand and One Arabian Nights. The text that has become known as the Goetia is the first book of what is commonly referred to as the Lemegeton, a collection of five texts traditionally attributed to King Solomon. The most popu- lar versions (including the one Crowley hired S.L. MacGregor Mathers to translate) are drawn primarily from translations of Sloane Manuscripts nos. 2731 and 3648 in the possession of the British Library. Few individuals today are so naive as to believe that the author was indeed the legendary Hebrew King. Indeed, there is noevi- dence to demonstrate that the five texts are even the work of a sin- gle author or that the authors were even practicing magicians. In fact, by the very nature of the translations it is obvious that the scribe or scribes were decidedly hostile toward the art. Many of the Spirits are clearly the Gods and Goddesses of older religions who were \"banished\" to the infernal regions by the new Order. Many of the Dukes especially seem to have been originally female in char- acter (a most dangerous spiritual idea to lonely monastic scribes prone to fantasies). Magic books attributed to King Solomon circulated throughout Europe since at least the middle of the Sixteenth Century. Sloane 2731 dates from 1687 and most likely is the result of one practi- tioner's desire to have his favorite \"Solomonic\" works bound con- veniently into one volume. It also appears that he used the opportunity to update the texts by revising the language and using the vernacular of the day. As archaic as the language appears to us today, The Lemegeton repre- sents a \"new, improved\" Seventeenth Century version of far older material. How old, we cannot say. 8 The Magical Revival of the late 1800s resulted in new transla- tions and the Lemegeton and the Goetia emerged from near com- plete obscurity and into the light of relative obscurity and students and practitioners of the occult have been tantalized by its mysteries ever since. Modern editions of the Goetia remain in print and continue to sell very well (almost every student of magick worth his/her salt owns at least one copy), yet relatively few individuals actually have participated in a Goetic evocation. The reasons are many but perhaps the single most compelling excuse is rooted in the mis- taken belief that in order to succeed in evocation one must conform exactly with the procedures and conjurations outlined in the text. The seemingly endless pages of tedious, archaic and parochial conjurations, constraints, exorcisms and curses continue to bewil- der and discourage 99% of would-be Goetic magicians. And that is precisely what they are meant to do! THEORY The Universe was very simple from the traditional Goetic magi- cian's point of view. Above him was God, the creator of the world and the ultimate source of his authority. Below the magician was an \"infernal\" world, inhabited by demon spirits who were once \"Angels of the Lord\" but now exiled from heaven as punishment for their pride and disobedience. Their \"fall\" established the inter- dependent threefold \"world\" in which we find ourselves; Heaven, Earth, and Hell. Like the Titans of Greek Mythology, the Infernal Spirits (not God) are responsible for the maintenance of the material world including the \"earthly-fleshly\" nature of Man. 8 For the convenience of the modern reader we have also put the translated material in Chapter Eight in modern vernacular and, where obvious, returned certain Spirits to their original gender."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"44 The I[[ustratecf Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifson 45 As a resident of the Earth, the magician stands between the Divine and the Infernal Worlds. If he is pious before the eyes of his \"God\" then he has the Divine authority to order and control the lower spirits. To achieve this authoritative state of mind the magicians of old recited lengthy litanies of affirmations and self-aggrandizements, itemizing their high morals and examples of their religious piety. (\"You obeyed Moses, you obeyed Aaron, you'll obey me too!\") Once he had convinced himself that he had the authority to com- mand the Spirit, the magician next had to achieve the subjective state of mind whereby he could actually \"see\" it. This he induced by the use of \"magic words\" which he recited much like a mantra. In this way, he created a strange and mystic atmosphere in which nothing was impossible and anything could happen. Standing in the Circle, protected by the Divine names with which he had aligned himself, the magician (pumped up by affirmations and \"intoxicated\" by the magic words) concentrated upon the Triangle until the Spirit appeared. The universally holy virtues of all things triune was enough to trap the Spirit in the Triangle long enough to receive the Charge from the magician. After receiving his orders the Spirit was given License to Depart to go forth and do the magician's bidding. The text of the Goetia is filled with the details of such opera- tions-page after page of formal Conjurations, Constraints, Invo- cations, Curses, Greater Curses, Addresses to the Spirit on his arrival and departure, etc. PRACTICE There exist today, Goetic magicians (both solitary practitioners and organized groups) who operate strictly \"by the book.\" The Circle, the Triangle and all the diagrams are constructed exactly as illustrated in the Goetia. They recite (or most often read) the conju- rations, constraints and curses exactly as written in the 1687 text. Ceremonies of some of these magicians are a thrill to behold and, without a doubt, the Art will forever be perpetuated in its classic form because of their dedicated labor. It must be pointed out, however, that there is absolutely no necessity (nor particular advantage) to blindly conforming with the Conjuration scripts of the ancient texts. The Spirits are no more impressed if you say \"thee\" and \"thine\" than they are if you say \"you\" and \"yours.\" Aleister Crowley was aware of this and crafted several versions of his own conjurations. In fact, as we shall see later, in his own copy of the Goetia he simply hand copied the Second Key of the Enochian system. It is our opinion (and that of other Crowley scholars) that for personal Goetic conjurations Crowley most likely in his later years discarded the traditional conjurations and simply recited the First and Second Enochian Calls. It is also our opinion that the most effective conjurations are of the magician's own design. We encourage the reader, once the fundamentals of the system are thoroughly grasped, to create your own conjuration which, like your Temple, equipment, and proce- dures, is uniquely yours."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Q[:HAPTER ~IX Minimum Requirements ItI%ven though we believe that the Conjurations and certain ~other components of the Sloane material are anachronisti- cally superfluous to modern Goetic evocation, we are not suggesting that the basic elements of the system are not sound. On the contrary, the fundamentals of the classic procedure are ex- tremely important. We do feel it is very important to encourage the reader to break free from the superstitious idea that magick will only work by blind conformity to any dictated procedure (new or old). The understanding of what is truly necessary and what is not is what separates the real magician from a character in a role- playing game. THE TEMPLE The Temple need only be a room large enough to accommodate the Circle and Triangle. A living room, a bedroom or a similar area where privacy can be achieved is sufficient. If there is other furni- ture in the room care must be taken to clear the room of clutter and any appearance of disorder. (Often a room is more efficiently ban- ished by a good dusting and vacuuming than by the banishing ritual itself.) THE CIRCLE In a very real sense the Circle is not the chalk or tape on the floor but the aura of the magician himself. It not only defines and cir- cumscribes all that he or she is, it stands as a fortress against all that is \"outside.\" 47"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"48 The I([ustrate!f Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifson 49 The Circle is the magician's universe and the center of the Circle is the point of supreme balance, the fulcrum from which he moves the worlds. For the purpose of Goetic evocation the Circle is not optional. It is a fundamental requirement in the Temple for it is the safety zone in which the magician can stand with complete confi- dence to command the forces trapped in the Triangle. Upon the floor of your Temple draw, tape, paint, scratch or otherwise create a Circle approximately nine feet in diameter. Approximately six inches inside the circumference draw another Circle. In the space between the circles place the Holy Names of your choice. It would be presumptuous for us to suggest to the reader what Holy Names are most appropriate. It is each magician's quest to determine for himlherself which \"Deity or Deities\" are harmonious with the magician's own magical universe. The Circle itself is a perfect symbol of divinity. A simple unbroken line with no names at all can be sufficient for individuals whose realization of this abstraction is profound. I have used on occasion a thin silk cord which, after the ceremony (when I felt it advantagous to stay in the Circle for hours or days), I have wrapped around myself as a belt. The classic Circle was that of a coiled serpent upon whose body was written-in Hebrew-the Deity, Angel, and Archangel Names attributed to the first nine Sephiroth of the Tree of Life. The space between the circles was bright, deep yellow. The lettering was in black. The classic Circle also enclosed four Hexagrams positioned at the quarters and was surrounded by four Pentagrams positioned at the cross-quarters. Examples of traditional and modern magical Circles can be found in the Appendix. THE TRIANGLE Like the Circle, the Triangle is not optional. It is the area in which the Spirit appears and is compelled to obedience. (See the Appendix.) In the East (or in the indicated direction of the particular Spirit in question) about two feet from the Circle, draw, tape, paint, scratch or otherwise create a Triangle, each side measuring three feet. The Triangle's base shall be toward the Circle. Upon each side of the Triangle place the Three Holy Names of your choice. The classic Goetic Triangle was surrounded by three names: ANAPHAXETON (Great God of all the Heavenly Host) to the left, PRIMEUMA TON (the First and the Last) at the base, and TETRAGRAMMATON (the ineffable God name Y.H.V.H.) to the right. Inside the classic Triangle, at the points, were placed the letters MI-CHA-EL (the Archangel Michael). In the center was a circle. The circle in the center of the Triangle was green (the re- mainder of the inside was white) and the names on the outside of were written in red. As mentioned earlier, the names around the Circle are entirely the prerogative of each magician. You might ask yourself what qualities, virtues, or powers you hold sacred in your own magical disciplines: LOVE-WILL-UNION; FAITH-ROPE-CHARITY; SAT-CHIT-ANANDA; or words, numbers or formulae which represent such things, could work nicely if they are meaningful to you. The almost infinite metaphysical virtues of a triangle make it a perfect device to confine and control that which has never been confined and controlled by you. For many magicians a simple Triangle with a circle in the center suffices quite nicely (with or without the surrounding names). Incense may also be placed inside the Triangle but once the Temple is opened and the Spirit conjured the magician should not leave the Circle or reach into the Triangle. THE SEAL OF THE SPIRIT Upon the circle of the Triangle will rest the Seal or Sigil of the Spirit drawn upon parchment. These symbols are derived from the traditional Lemegeton material and theoretically are the living representations of the Spirits. Some texts dictate that it be made of virgin calf-skin parchment and the drawing done with the blood of an owl or some other beast. Such heroics we feel were intended as \"fool traps\" and are unnecessary for modern workings. But if you"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"would feel better about the operation if you used the virgin calf- skin, please go ahead. After the ceremony you should take pains to house the Seal in a special container. You should never be careless with an \"activated\" Seal or forget where you put it. Depending upon the purpose of the evocation you may wish to carry the Seal upon your person or attach it to an object relating to the operation. I have learned from bitter experience that it is unwise to have two operators in a single operation or to give or loan an activated Seal to another person. It is hard enough to keep your own Will directed toward the one purpose of the operation. I have found it impossible for two individuals to be so unified in their magical resolve as to gain joint control over a Goetic Spirit. (This does not apply to an operation utilizing an operator and a receiver or to sexual Goetia workings such as are described later in this book.) THE HEXAGRAM OF SOLOMON The Golden Dawn defined the Hexagram as \" ...a powerful sym- bol representing the operation of the Seven Planets under the presidency of the Sephiroth ...\" This very recognizable symbol of Judaism, sometimes called the Shield of David, is a most appro- priate emblem of the Divine Macrocosm (The big world of God, represented in ancient times by the Sun surrounded by the six then- known Planets. (see Appendix). The Goetic magician wears the Hexagram on the skirt of his or her robe to act as a shield or badge of authority. By displaying the Hexagram to the Spirit the magician proves he or she is part of and representative of the Macrocosmic Order with full power to exer- cise that authority. Upon seeing the Hexagram the Spirits (by tradition) are compelled to take on human form. The classic Hexagram was painted upon calfskin parchment and was covered with linen. Modern magicians should feel free to make the Hexagram as ornate or as simple as they see fit but by no means should omit this very important magical device. 51 50 Tile I((ustratecf Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifson THE PENTAGRAM OF SOLOMON The Golden Dawn defined the Pentagram as \" ...a powerful sym- bol representing the operation of the Eternal Spirit and the Four Elements under the Presidency of the letters of the Name Yeheshuah ...\" (see Appendix). In contrast to the Hexagram, the Pentagram is the symbol of the Microcosm (the little world of Man) represented by the four ele- ments of Fire, Water, Air and Earth governed by the Fifth element of Spirit. As Hexagram affirms that the magician is in harmony with the Macrocosmic Order the Pentagram affirms that he is Master of the Microcosmic Order. By wearing these two symbols the magician is reminded that he or she is positioned between Heaven and Hell, Executor of the Gods and Master of the Demons. The Goetia says that the Pentagram should be engraved upon a medallion of silver or gold and worn around the neck. On the flip side of the medallion should be engraved the Seal of the Spirit being evoked. Many modem magicians prefer to construct the medallion from the Spirit's appropriate metal (gold for Kings, copper for Dukes, etc.), The Pentagram engraved upon the front side, the Spirit's Seal on the back. OTHER REQUIREMENTS THE WAND The Greater Key of Solomon describes the Wand and many other magical weapons in great detail. It is accurate to say that to follow the instructions for their construction to the letter would require many months (if not years) to accomplish. It is generally agreed that such instructions are red herrings designed to discourage the dull and unworthy. The Wand is the weapon of the magician's will and is the instru- ment with which he conjures. (The Sword, while effective for ban- ishing and intimidation, is not the weapon for Conjuration.)Usu- ally the Wand is approximately the length of the magician's arm"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"measured from the finger tips to the elbow. Traditionally it is made of a straigh~ branch of Almond or Hazel wood and is approxi- mately the diameter of the magician's little finger. THE MAGIC RING OR DISC There are Goeticmagicians who say the Magic Ring is an unnec- essary addition to the list of magical weapons. And, personally, I have never encountered any Spirit from whom I have needed to protect myself against their \"stinking sulphurous fumes and flam- ing breath.\" Nevertheless I have always had the Ring at hand when evoking any of the Spirits for whom the text says the Ring is required. (see Appendix). One of the most adeptGoetic magicians I have ever met related a remarkable tale of his experience with the Magic Ring. While evoking Astaroth\", he became so enamored by the Spirit's beauty that he forgot the -purpose of the evocation. He said that the Temple was filled with an intoxicating perfume which seem to issue from her lovely mouth and that as she spoke to him his only thought was that he had to somehow make physical love to her. It was only ?y accident that his eyes fell upon the Magic Ring and he recognized the need for him to hold it up before his face- not to protect himself from the stinking breath of a monster but to help himself \"snap out of it\" before he was lured from the Circle to try to make love to the Spirit in the Triangle. !he above expe~ience an~ that of others indicate that the Magic RIng should be Included In the Goetic magician's arsenal of weapons. The original text says it is made of gold or silver (of course) and was bright yellow with black lettering. But we feel that any mate- rial, even paper,will be effective. 53 52 The I[[ustrate!C Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifson THE BRASS BOTTLE According to tradition Solomon sealed up the Evil Spirits in a \"Vessel of Brass\" and sealed it with a leaden seal. While the occa- sion seldom arises for its use, a small brass bottle can be employed if necessary against disobedient Spirits as a threat or a punishment device. The Seal of the Spirit is placed inside the bottle and a lead cap placed upon the top. In cases of extreme disobedience the lead cap can be melted into place. [Once, to threaten a particularly hos- tile Spirit, I placed his Seal in the bottle; rested the lead cap on the mouth of the bottle; placed the bottle on an unlighted piece of self igniting charcoal; placed the charcoal upon a bed of match heads in the censer; and placed the censer in the Triangle with pieces of stick incense burning perpetually just inches over this whole assembly. The idea being that if even one burning incense stick were to drop an ash still containing a little coal, it would ignite the match heads, igniting the charcoal, heating up the brass bottle, eventually melting the lead seal into place. I (and my remarkably understanding wife) kept the incense sticks burning for three days before the task I had charged the Spirit with was finally executed.] THE ROBE The classic outfit includes a long linen robe (white), a cap or a mitre and belt made from a lion's skin upon which are written all the names which are upon the Circle. Any robe that holds for you magical significance is appropriate for Goetic evocation. A simple white robe is excellent. If you belong to a magical society or hold personal degrees, the robe and insignia of your Grade is most appropriate. If you look good, you will feel good. It is not a good idea to overdress to the degree that you feel silly or pretentious. 9 No matter what the text may say, Astaroth is the thinly disguised version of the Goddess Astarte, who is anything but a frightening monster."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"(!CHAPTER ~EVEN The Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia f7Y s we indicated in Chapter Four, the firs. t requisite for a sue- ca, cessful Goetic evocation is to firmly establish your power and declare your authority to command the Spirits.

(See Crowley's Liber Samech.) It is easy to see that this ceremony serves as both Temple Open- ing and Declaration of Authority. Also the Barbarous Names of Evocation serve to \"intoxicate\" the mind of the magician and evoke the necessary state of consciousness.

One now should know beyond the shadow of a doubt that he or she has the spiritual authority to command the Spirits and that no Spirit will be able to resist the Conjuration. It is enough at this point to point your Wand toward the Triangle and say something like: Hear me, 0 Spirit (Name), and appear before this Circle in afair human form. Come peaceably and visibly, before me in the Trian- gle of art. Repeat the Spirit's name several times until you \"see\" or sense the Spirit in the Triangle. It should be noted that a large portion of the original Goetia is dedicated to stronger and stronger Conjurations and Curses in- tended to be used if the Spirit is reluctant to come. If it still does not appear there are even invocations of the King who is the \"boss\" of your Spirit. The mere existence of these extra Conjurations is enough to create a level of doubt in the mind of the magician that his first Conjuration might not be strong enough. If you are worried from the start that your Conjuration will not work, then chances are it won't. We strongly suggest that you keep your Conjuration short and simple and that you recite it immediately after the Preliminary Invocation when your strength is at its peak. If it is obvious that the Spirit has not obeyed your Conjuration; if you are sure that there is not something (visible or invisible) in the Triangle you may simply declare that since the Spirit will not co- operate with you, then you have no choice but to annihilate it and remove it forever from your universe. \"If you are not for me, you are against me and if you do not immediately comply with my wishes I will burn your Seal to ashes and remove you forever from my Universe. \""},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"ijtHE jfIRST <!CONJURATION (Enochian and English) 01 vinu od zodakame, Ilasa, Gahe N: od I invoke and move thee, 0 thou, Spirit N: and elanusahe vaoresagi laida, being exalted above ye in the power of the Most High, gohusa pujo ilasa, darebesa! do-o-f-ape I say unto thee, Obey! in the name Beralanensis, Baldachiensis, Paumachia, od Beralanesis, Baldachiensis, Paumachia, and It has been our experience that this simple threat is enough to make the most uncooperative Spirit \"appear.\" Usually at this point the Spirit wants to appear, get it's orders and get out of there. Memorization of the lengthy Conjurations of the classical texts are only necessary if the magician's sense of Art demands it. Below is a Conjuration adapted by Aleister Crowley and trans- lated by him into the \"Angelic\" language of Enochian. Crowley obviously felt that the Enochian language had more universal applications than just those relating to Enochian Magick. As a matter of fact, as we mentioned earlier, there is every reason to believe that when Crowley performed Goetic Evocation he simply used the First and Second Call of the Enochian System. (See The Enochian World of Aleister Crowley: Enochian Sex Magick, New Falcon Publications, 1991 and following the Conjuration below.) We have arranged the Conjuration with the English translation appearing directly below each line of Enochian.We have done our best to make the translation clear enough for the reader to custom- ize a conjuration of their own. As you can see, Crowley has occa- sionally simplified or paraphrased portions of the text.

Most often you will first sense the presence in the Triangle and then an image may begin to appear in the incense smoke. If you utilize a Black Mirror in the Triangle most often you will see at least some distortion of your own image but if you expect to immediately see a solidly projected cartoon or holographic image in the Triangle you are most likely going to be disappointed. We feel it is a mistake to take up too much time and energy try- ing to force yourself to see the Spirit. You are here to command a Spirit not to explore a vision. When you feel certain that the Spirit is in the Triangle, welcome it graciously and thank it for coming. Proceed immediately to issue your instructions. Word your commands in such a way as to avoid ambiguities that will provide loopholes which the Spirit may use to avoid fulfilling the intention of your instructions. (The classic story of the Monkey's Paw serves as an excellent example.) Never fail to stipulate that you want your instructions carried out without harm to you or you loved-ones. Give specific time limitations on when you want your instruc- tions executed. Tell the Spirit in no uncertain terms that if it dis- obeys the instructions and does not meet the deadline, that you will conjure it again and issue a very strict ultimatum. (If this becomes necessary do not fail to do so exactly when you told it you would. Tell it you are giving it one more opportunity to fulfill it's charge or you will slowly bum it's Seal until it is utterly destroyed. Do not bluff. If you say you are going to do something, do it.) IMPORTANT: Stay in control of the situation. Every aspect oj the evocation must be on the magician's terms. Even though you may find it fascinating, do not enter into unnecessary conversation with the Spirit. It is quite common for the Spirit to attempt to make a deal with the magician or initiate negotiations on the Spirit's terms. This must be firmly yet courteously resisted at all costs. You may, if you feel magnanimous, tell the Spirit that after it executes your orders satisfactorily, you will do something nice for it to acknowledge its loyalty; etching its Seal in precious metal or some such honor. But you should take special care to assure the Spirit that as long as it remains loyal and obedient it will share in your good fortune and spiritual success. You will raise it up even as you are raised up. \\!CHE 1L-ICENCE \\!Co 1lBEPART After you have given the Spirit its instructions give it permission to go and get to work for you.

The timing was especially important to the ancient practitioners. Even though we do not wish to discourage any practitioner who wishes to make the observation of the days and hours part of his or her working, the experience of many mod- ern magicians has shown that the Spirits are easily evoked at any hour of the day or night and on any day of the year. In Crowley's 777 (Weiser, 1986), in columns 155, 157, 159, 161, 163 and 165, he attributed the Seventy-Two Spirits of the Goetia (in pairs, Day/Night) to the Decans of the Zodiac. By doing so, he established a relationship to the small cards of the Tarot and, of course, to the days of the year. We have included that information along with the traditional attributes of the Spirits in what follows. We caution the reader to remember that these correspondences do not serve to perfectly define each other. For example, the Spirit Bael is attributed to the daylight hours of the first Ten Degrees of Aries, and these degrees are represented in the Tarot by the TWO OF WANDS; but that does not necessarily mean that in all matters Bael is the TWO OF WANDS or that the TWO OF WANDS always represents Bael. To illustrate how this information could be useful we offer the following example: A magician is troubled by a personal or magical problem, let's say a misunderstanding with a friend or colleague. He decides to perform a Tarot Divination to get insight into how to proceed to 71"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"72 Tftt I[[ustratecf Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifson 73 correct the situation. The final card in his Tarot spread is the EIGHT OF SWORDS (Interference). This, in itself, quite accu- rately describes the situation but does not give him much of a clue as to what to do. But, he notes that the EIGHT OF SWORDS rep- resents the first Ten Degrees of Gemini and that this period is rep- resented (in the daytime) by the seventh Goetic Spirit, AMON, who, among other things, \"tells all things past and to come and procures feuds and reconciles controversies between friends.\" After some thought, he decides to evoke AMON for the purpose of \"reconciling the controversy.\" It only takes a little imagination to see other applications for these correspondences. The illustrations of the 72 Spirits that appear below are the work of artist-clairvoyant David P. Wilson who is also a talented and adept Goetic Magician. Over a period of 15 years, he has evoked each of the Spirits at least once, and has recorded some of the most remarkable Goetic experiences we have yet encountered. But it is very important for you to remember that, because no two people have the same visual-emotional \"vocabulary,\" the images of the Goetic universe will be unique to each of us. When you partici .. pate in an evocation you most likely will \"see\" something entirely different than the images described and illustrated below. Do not think that these sketches are what you must see when evoking any particular Spirit. They are intended to serve only as springboards to your imagination. ]NTRODUCTION: jfROM ~HE ~OETIA ~ hese are the 72 Mighty Kings and Princes which King Solomon Commanded into a Vessel of Brass, together with their Legions. Of whom BELIAL, BILETH, ASMODA Y, and GAAP, were Chief. And it is to be noted that Solomon did this because of their pride, for he never declared other reason why he thus bound them. And when he had thus bound them up and sealed the Vessel, he by Divine Power chased them all into a deep Lake or Hole in Babylon. And they of Babylon, wondering to see such a thing, they did then go wholly into theLake, to break the Vessel open, expect- ing to find great store of Treasure therein. But when they had bro- ken it open, out flew the Chief Spirits immediately, with their Legions following them; and they were all restored to their former places except BELIAL, who entered into a certain Image, and thence gave answers unto those who did offer Sacrifices unto him, and worshiped the Image as their God. OBSERVATIONS First, thou shalt know and observe the Moon's age for thy work- ing. The best days be when the Moon Luna is 2, 4,6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 days old, as Solomon saith; and no other days be profitable. The Seals of the 72 Kings are to be made in Metals. The Chief Kings' in Sol (Gold); Marquises' in Luna (Silver); Dukes' in Venus (Copper); Prelacies' in Jupiter (Tin); Knights' in Saturn (Lead); Presidents' in Mercury (Mercury); Earls' in Venus (Copper) [Crowley's notes suggest Mars (Ironj-s-Ed.], and Luna (Silver), alike equal, etc. These 72 Kings are under the Power of AMAYMON, CORSON, ZIMIMA Y or ZIMINIAR, and- GOAP, who are the Four Great Kings ruling in the Four Quarters, or Cardinal Points, 11 viz.: East, West, North, and South, and are not to be called forth except it be upon Great Occasions; but are to be Invocated and Commanded to send such or such a Spirit that is under their Power and Rule, as is shown in the following Invocations or Conjurations. And the Chief Kings may be bound from 9 till 12 o'clock at Noon, and from 3 till Sunset; Marquises may be bound from 3 in the afternoon till 9 at Night, and from 9 at Night till Sunrise; Dukes may be bound from Sunrise till Noonday in Clear Weather; Prelates may be bound any 11 These four Great Kings are usually called Oriens, or Uriens, Paymon or Paymonia, Ariton or Egyn, and Amaymon or Amaimon.

As interesting and effective as your evocations can be they are more useful if you can discover which Spirits operate in your life independent of your will and which ones you should evoke in order to enrich and balance your life.

Begin ~ \"relationship\" or dialogue with the Spirit. Ask it what it is trying tc communicate to you. Command it to cease affecting you or reward it depending on what you are trying to accomplish. Keep in mind that reward and punishment are two of the primary means of communicating with Goetia Spirits. Sometimes, instead of direct punishment withholding something the Spirit wants works will. The important thing to keep in mind is that your operation must be under your Will. Capricious behavior will not benefit you. Plan out your operations carefully. TYPES OF PEOPLE AND TYPES OF SPIRITS A simple understanding of psychological types as laid down by Carl Jung will be very useful in your workings. While I am not an advocate of his therapy or that of his follow- ers, I am very respectful of his genius and the maps of the mind he has given us. The first major type is the extravert. For the extravert energy flows from him to the outside world while in his unconscious mind he is pushing the outside world away from him. The second major type is the introvert. He feels overwhelmed by the outside world and wishes to push it away from him. On the other hand he is fed by the outside world and secretly invests his own energy into it which in tum also overwhelms him. The introvert is interested in \"banishing objects,\" that is remov- ing their effect upon him, while the extravert is particularly inter- ested in evoking objects or bringing them closer to him. In Ooetia evocation the introvert might practice a more extraverted form, while the extrovert might try a more introverted form of evocation. Goetia evocations can also be related to time. Day time evoca- tions are more extroverted and less frightening, while night time evocations are more introverted and more frightening. Certain Spirits can be more in harmony with extraversion while others more in harmony with introversion. Or it might be time to explore a repressed function by evoking Spirits which are opposite of the conscious attitude. For example, introverts might evoke extraverted Spirits at night while extraverts might evoke introverted Spirits during the day. Throughout the life of a person a proper balance can occur when the extravert learns introversion and the introvert learns extraver- sion.Frequently this balance occurs by making the opposite point of view conscious and in the case of evocation \"visible\" in the form of a particular Spirit. In drawing the sigil and evoking the Ooetic figures which represent the opposite of your conscious atti- tude you will begin to know and gain control of the repressed parts of your personality. In addition to the two major types which Jung speaks about there are four other functions-two known as the \"rational\" functions (thinking and feeling) and two known as the \"irrational\" functions (sensation and intuition). These four functions or types also represent approaches to life. The \"opposite\" or inferior (less used) function for the thinking type is feeling and vice versa. The \"opposite\" or inferior function for the sensation type is intuition and vice versa. Most of us tend to favor our strong \"suit\" while neglecting our inferior \"suit.\" Con- fronting your weaker function can be very unpleasant, thus people have a tendency to project on others the dark side of their weaker function. In some cases friendships are based on two individuals each having the opposite of their inferior function as the other's superior function. This can serve the person by keeping his weaker or less devel- oped component out of consciousness or awareness. It can also lead to many problems. Evocation can be used to develop the weaker or inferior function. Knowing how to identify the various types will also help the operator choose the correct partner in operations where medium- ship is essential. Certain types do not make good mediums for the manifestation of particular Spirits. One reason for failure in Ooetia workings ia that people do not spend enough time examining the issues of typel and personalities.

The dross or the weaker function is rich in symbolic material and energy and provides the person with qualities and abilities missing in his life. Without having to embel- lish further, developing the inferior function makes you feel better. Notice I did not say more whole. You can't know wholeness except possibly by feeling better. Wholeness is an abstraction, feeling better is not. The psychological model of types provides the operator with an excellent opportunity to explore Goetia from a different point of view and with a different aim in mind. This is not to say that evo- cation should be practiced solely for these purposes. Evocation is a result oriented operation. It is not \"High Magick\" with sublime altruistic aims. It is practical and down to earth, designed to \"get answers\" and cause effects. ~HAPTER m;EN TRanCing OuT aNd SeXuAL ,EcStaSy Goetia Evocation and The Orgasm of Death \\It he breaking of expectation is one of the best means of going into Trance.

Some of these things will be very new and others you are already well familiar with. Try it again. This time do it loudly. When you are ready just let go.

It is important to allow yourself to go as deep as you can. You should read the above example a couple of times before actually starting the procedure. Get a sense of the excitement. Feel free to design and redesign your sexual trance until it suits your needs. The use of sex and hypnosis in Goetia evocation is unique to this particular book, that is not to say that others have not attempted these experiments and reported them in other writings. What we are doing here is dealing openly with the issue and providing a workable framework. Remember our framework is not made of stone and appropriate alterations can be made with experience. We have found that the combination of sex and hypnosis is ideal in expanding the reception of the Me~i~m providin~ more pro- found and interesting data from the Spirit, However, It should be pointed out that this operation should not be undertaken unless both the operator and the medium have agreed openly to undertake it and have spelled out all the details. This working requires spec~al preparation and thus both participants sh?uld work out. the details together well before they start their workI~gs. The medium should know ahead of time that the operator will sexually exhaust the medium. This is essential for the best results. Sometimes there may be some minor discomfort for the medium in this part of the oper- ation and the medium should allow the discomfort to dissipate at its own accord. The operator should be aware that he is manipulat- ing high energy charges and should be very sensitive t~ the minor discomforts as indications that a new level of ecstasy IS about to occur.

Be sure to put the skrying mirror In a triangle. . . . . . . When the Spirit appears, the operator intensifies sexual activity, but not so much as to distract from the vision. The operator should have a sense of when to ask questions and must take complete charge in directing the session. The person who is acting as the Medium must feel completely free to let go. The Medium should not feel responsible for the outcome of the session. Pains should be taken to be aware of all the Goetia rules before starting this operation. The license to depart could coincide with an orgasm. The operator should be ce~tai~ that the Medium has snapped out of the trance once the session IS over."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"~PPENDIX Traditional Circle 229"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"230 The I[[ustrateef Goetia DuQuette • Hyatt • Wifson 231 ABRAHADABRA Modern Circle Hexagram Of Solomon Magical Ring Pentagram Of Solomon Sun & Moon Conjoined"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"232 The I[[ustratecC Goetia TilE PORrJltL S'fi,N.s I-\"-·\"~ ~ \"''-1< .... .. ...
