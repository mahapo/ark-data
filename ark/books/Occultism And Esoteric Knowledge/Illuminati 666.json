In the last book of the Bi ble, Jesus Christ gives His Last warning before He returns the second time. This Last Day wa rning is found in chapters 13, 14, 16, 17 & 18 of the Book o f Revelation. Jesus warns His pe ople about how the whole worl d will be deceived into worshipping Satan, symbolized as the Seven H eaded Dragon attacking a woman, a symbol o f the True Faith. In Revelation 13:4, 8, 9 Je sus' prediction about the worshi p of Satan throughout this world may be read: \"And they WORSHIPPED THE DRAGON which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beas t? Who is able to make wa r with him? ... And all that dwell upon the earth SHALL WORSHIP HIM, WHOSE NAMES ARE NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF LI FE OF THE LAMB SLAIN FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. If any man have an ear, let him hear.\" The Apostle John wrote: \"Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many an tichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.\" 1.John 2:18. The Apostle Paul warn ed: \"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son o f p erdition; Who opposeth and exal teth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped: so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, sh ewing himself that he is God.\" 2.Thessalonians 2:3,4. There are various ways our Lord has made known to His followers how to detect Satan who is the invisible head of a partly religious and partly political movement. Revelation 13:18 warns it would be branded with the num ber 666. In Revelation 17:5 our Lord describes this satanic movement that is antichrist in a symbol of a lewd b eautiful woman. And upon her forehead was a name written, \"MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.\" The very last warning our Lord is now giving the deceive d world is found in Revelation 18:4. \"And I heard another voi ce from heaven, saying, COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE, THAT YE BE NOT PARTAKERS OF HER SINS, AND THAT YE RECEIVE NOT OF HER PLAGUES.\" There are three distinct messages symbolized as three angels in Revelation 14. Revelation 14:6, 7 is calling the world away from the worshi p of the Dragon, to wo rship God who created the heaven, earth, and the sea, and the fountai ns of waters. In Revelation 14:8 it tells how Babylon the Great is fall en and how she has made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. However, in Revelation 14:9,10 we read the most solemn warning eve r given to the world, of which most are completely ignorant. Satan is hardly ever mentioned in many Christian circles, much less how he is pred icted in Scripture to lead most to lose thei r"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"salvation. \"And the third angel fo llowed them, saying with a loud voi ce, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his MA RK in his forehead, or in hi s hand, the same shall drink o f the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fi re and brimstone in th e presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.\" Revelation 14:9,10. God reveals that all na tions have already b een deceived by \"Babylon the Great, The Mother of Harlots and Abomin ations of the Earth.\" And our Lord is calling His people out o f Babylon. But, the question to mo st is, what is Babylon? This is the whole purpose of this b ook. It is to lay wide open for all to see what the sins of Babylon the Great are, and who she is, and who this mysterious scarlet colored b east is that she is riding on, as described in Revelation 17:1-8. While we study the histor y and the nature of \"Babylon th e Great (and of the Beast that is carrying her),\" we will learn th at there was, is, and always shall be in this world, avowed worshippers of Lucifer. Some will be shocked to learn that Luciferians have lived and died in p romoting the worship of Lucifer through Babyl onian, Egyptian and Dr uid Witchcraft, and are determined to overthrow al l religions and governments. Their goal is to unite the world into a One World Government, and exalt Lucifer as the only god of this world! As we continue to st udy the nature of \"Babylon the Gr eat,\" we will study the philosophies of \"Wicca\" Wicca is the modern version of Babylonian, Egypt ian, and Druid Witchcraft with millions of both male and female members. We will learn how a postles of Lucifer in the past and present are using Secret Societies, Communism, Internat ional Banking, Christian fronts, social issues to further thei r plans. We will learn how thes e modern day witches are eve r determined to overthrow the wo rship of Jesus Christ and Chri stianity by using subliminal warfare (Mind Sciences), and physical force. This Luciferian plot to de stroy all religions and all governments, so that a One World Luciferi an Government may be established, is coming today, in what is known as \"The Aquarian Age,\" or \"The New Age Movement.\" In Latin it is called Novus Ordo Seclorum (New Order for the Ages). But its real, concealed name is The Illuminati. And, it will be shown that it was from the Secr et Order of The Illuminati, that Communism was derived! We will study the origin of the number 666, and who toda y is branded wi th it. We will study the Mark of the Beast with whom no true follower of Jesus will identify. We will take a j ourney through documentive histor y starting with Luci fer's rebellion in Heaven, and continue to expose through history how Lucifer was worshipped, both ignoran tly and openly, through the astrological systems of Sun worship. Af ter the camouflages have been removed from p aganism that reveal it was in reality Satan who was worshipped as the Sun-god, then we shall remove all the camouflages Lucifer is hi ding behind today, through false systems o f Christianity, and through an international pol itical movement for a One World Government. These two symbols, \"Babylon the Grea t\" and the Beast that ascendeth out of the Bottomless Pit, will be carefully studied a nd understood later on in th e book. However, before the ordinary reader can comprehe nd any of these things, we must go back into history to the time of Adam and Eve, and to the time of Noah and Nimrod. The origin of lies trac es to Lucifer (Genesis 3:4). And the origin of false religion also began with Lucifer. In Isaiah 14:12-15 we read: \"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of th e morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my thr one above the stars of God: I wi ll sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit.\" It has been Lucifer's plan from ancient ti mes to gradually unite this entire world into a One World Government that w ould reject its Creator and worship Lucifer instead."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Lucifer before his fall was the most exal ted angel next to Christ . The \"son of the morning\" stood in the presence of God wi th Christ. He was the cove ring Cherub, the lightbearer fo r God. However, Lucifer began to think of himsel f as equal in splendor and wisdom to God. He b egan to think he also deserved worship from the Lord's servants, and began to plot against the Lord of Heaven. Lucifer, the covering Cher ub, did set his face to overthrow the worship o f God. Lucifer did not at once reveal his covetousness. If he had e xposed all of his plans to the Universe, where sin and rebell ion at that time were not known, he would not have gained much following. Lucifer's plot to overthrow th e government of Heaven would take long and careful planning. Little by litt le, Lucifer began to find others whose sympathy he could gain b y criticizing how the Lord managed the affairs of the Universe. Lucifer tried to make the God of Love, the Lord of the Sabbath, appear to be a selfis h tyrant. Lucifer, assuming the guise of godliness, led many Heav enly Beings to come over to his side by misrepresenting God's character, as if God Himself were the Evil One. Lucifer sowed seeds of murmuring, co mplaining and strife which germinated into rebellion, and caused divisions among the angels of Heaven. Luci fer tried to weaken the unity of Heaven, thinking this woul d weaken the power of the Al mighty. However, only one third of the Heavenly host chose the side of the god of confusion. The whole Universe chose only two sides; there was no middle ground. There was war in Heaven between Christ and Lucifer. \"And the great dragon was cast out, that old se rpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: He wa s cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\" Revelation 12:9. The very plans Lucifer tried to execute in Heaven, he is now c onditioning the people of the world to accept. Just as Satan, or Lucifer, con cealed his real plans from the angels in Heaven in the beginning to overthrow the worship of G od, so is Lucifer trying today to overthrow the True worship of God among the inhabitants of this world. Just as Satan did not suddenly expose his real plans that woul d have demanded the worship of him by Heavenly Beings, so has Satan camouflaged the wors hip of himself among earthly beings, through a world-wide network of gods and goddesses, and later th rough false systems of Christianity. Sun worship was the gr eatest rival religion of the worship of Jehovah in the Old Testament. It was through Sun worship that the worship of Lucifer was camouflaged throughout this world. Those who obeyed the pagan precepts were actually bowing their knee b efore the Devil, not gods as they thought. \"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to w hom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or o f obedience unto righteousness?\" Romans 6:16. As the angels of Heaven chose sides be fore Lucifer was cast out of heaven, so will the p eople of this world join into two distinct groups before the end of this age. The line o f distinction, which will be studied in detail in the closing chapte r, will be drawn by the Mark o f the Beast foretold in Re velation 13: 11-18 and 14:6-13. The Luciferian plot to overthrow the worship of Jesus has always worked in secret, using camouflages to remain hidden. It has not come upon the world suddenly, but litt le by little. Likewise, we must also trace this history of the great Luciferian Conspir acy little by little. We will expose how primitive man wa s deceived into worshipping Lu cifer, then bring the reade r down through the centuries and show how Luci fer is being worshipped in these modern 1990's. To begin this study, let's take a clos er look at the name \"Lucifer\" itself. The name \"Lucifer\" in Latin means \"Light-Bearer\" and ma y also mean the planet Venus, which is the \"morning star at dawn\"[2]. In Greek mythol ogy, Lucifer was personified as a male figure bearing a torch[3]. Hence, we ha ve the origin of the Light-Bear er of the Olympic Games. The Greek transliteration of the na me of this incarnation of Lucifer in the myth was Teitan. In middle English his name was Tita n, which also meant \"Sungod\"[4]. .A distorted record of the rebellion of Lucifer and that of the rebe l giant Nimrod has been preserved in Gree k"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"mythology. Titan (Teitan) , the personification of Lucifer, wa s the ancestor of a race of giant humans here on earth who were overthrown by the Olympian gods[6]. He nce, the word titan today means \"one gigantic in size or power.\" And, the word titanism today in our language means \"spirit of rebellion; or a defiance of and revolt ag ainst the established order o r authority\"[6]. As Lucifer was the chie f leader that led the angelic hos t to rebel agai nst God, so did N imrod cause the early descenda nts of Noah to rebel agai nst God. Flavius Josephus, the ancient Jewish historian, wrot e about Nimrod and how he sedu ced the people of his day to rebel against God, and was first to teach the arts of masonry, while building the \"Tower o f Babel.\" From the book \"The Complete Works of Flavius Josephus\", we read the following: \" ... Now it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and c ontempt of God. He was the grandson of Ham, the son of Noah, a bold man, and of grea t strength of hand. He p ersuaded them not to ascribe it to God, as if it was through his means they were happy, but to b elieve that it was their own courage which produced that happiness. He also gradually changed the government into tyranny, seeing no ot her way of turning men from fear of God, b ut to bring them into a cons tant dependence on his own power . He also said he would be revenged on God, if he would have a mind to drow n the world again, for th at he would build a tower too high for the waters to be able to reach! And that he would avenge himself on God for destroying their forefathers! \"Now the multitude were very ready to follow the determination of Nimrod, and to esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God; and they built a towe r, neither sparing any pains, no r b eing in any degree negligent about the work . And by reason of the multitude of hands employed in it, it grew very high, sooner than any one coul d expect; but the thickness of it was so great, and it was so strongly built, that thereby its great heig ht seemed, upon the view, to be less than it really wa s.\" (The Complete Works of Flavius Josephus, Whiston, Kregel Publications, 1960, 1978, p.30.) Nimrod tried to unite the whole known worl d of his day into a One World Government that would be anti-God or Antichrist. But God wanted the sons of Noah to eventually replenish the earth by traveling abroad the earth and settling in colonies. This would have kept in check the wickedness that has always deri ved out of the cities. In the beginning, it was not intended that man be crowded together in la rge cities. This tower of Babe l, the building of which Nimrod supervised, was to have two great significances. The city of Babel would become the metropolis of the world and unite its inhabitants under the dictatorial ru le of Nimrod. And its tower was to be a monument to man to stand as a symbol of the wis dom of its builders. By b uilding the city of Babel, Nimrod hoped to prevent the peopl e from scattering abroad into colonies as the Lord intended. While in the midst of this bui lding, when the tower reached an height that it could today be ca lled \"skyscraper,\" our Lord cam e against it. In Genesis 11:3-9 we read: \"And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose t op may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men bui lded. And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have one langua ge; and this they began to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have ima gined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not unde rstand one another's speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it Babel (confusion); because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence di d the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face o f all the earth.\" Nimrod, who also built Nineveh, was worshipped by its earl y inhabitants under his deified name \"Ninus.\" He was first to incite people to war with thei r neighbors after the confusion o f"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"tongues had scattered the early descendants of Noah over the earth. Trogus Pompeius, who wrote of Ninus, states that the first King of Nineveh caused the people to war against themselves. Alexander Hislop compiled this statement written by Trogus Pompeius, the ancient historian, in his book The Two Babylons, p. 23: \" 'Ninus, king of Assyri ans,' says Trogus Pompeius epit omized by Justin, 'first of all changed the contented moderation of the ancien t manners, incited by a new passion, the desire of conquest. He was the first who carried on war against his neighbours and he conquered all nations from Assyria to Lybia, as they were yet unacquainted with the arts of war.'\" Hislop goes on to quote another ancient historian named Diodorus Siculus and shows how Trogus Pompeius and Siculus both agree with each other. \" 'Ninus, the most ancient of the Assy rian kings mentioned in history, performed great actions. Being naturally of a wa rlike disposition, and ambitious of glory that results from valeur, he armed a consider able number of young men that were brave and vigorous like himself, trained them up a long time in labori ous exercises and hardships, and by that means accustomed them to bear the fa tigues of war, and to face dangers with in trepidity.' \" Loizeaux Brothers, Neptune, NJ, 1916. Hence, Nimrod (Ninus) was celebrated at Nineveh, which he built, as a War-god, and his epics as a hunter, a warrior, and his death were later imitated in th e Assyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Ameri can Indian Mysteries. His Egyptian name was Osiris[7]. To the Romans, he was also worshipped as Ma rs (which means \"The Rebel\"), from which ou r name March was derived. He was Zernebogus to the Anglo-Saxon, which means: \"The Seed of the Prophet Cush\"[8]. But, Nimrod's ancien t Babel name was Merodach, which means \"To Be Bold, or Rebel\"[9]. So here we find the re al meaning of these two gods found in Scripture: \"Bel (The Confounder) is confounded, Merodach (The Rebel) is broken in pieces Jeremiah 50:2).\" We will study more of the or igin of the name \"Bel\" later. In the Babylonian myth of Tammuz, or Thammuz (the equivalent to the Egyptian god Osiris, who actually wa s Nimrod, the ringleader in the great apostasy against our Lord, was ordered to be killed by a certain king. The reas on given for his death was that Tammuz, the incarnation of the Sun-god, tried to promote the worship of As trology to this certain king. However, this king ordered him to be put to death. Maimonides, another ancien t historian, had read deeply into the learning of the Chaldeans. He describes this myth, quoted by Hislop in The Two Babylons, p. 62: \"When the false prophet named Thammu z preached to a certain king that he should worship the seven stars and the tw elve signs of the Zodiac, that king ordered him to be put to a terrible death. On the night of his death all the images assemb led from the ends of the earth into the temple of Babylon, to the great golden image of the Sun, which was suspended b etween heaven and earth. That image prostrated itself in the midst of the temple, and so did all the images around it, while it related to th em all that had happened to Thammuz. The images wept and lamented all th e night long, and then in the mo rning they flew away, each to his own temple again, to the ends of the earth. And hence arose the cust om every year on the first day of the month of Thammuz to mourn and to weep for Thammuz.\" Now, in the worship of the Sun-god among the Mexicans, they believed that for the Sun- god to bestow life on the world, he needed also to receive life from it [10]. To show the reade r the murderous character of Satan displayed in people, and what human beings can be led to do b y his false religious spirit, we will explore some of the re asons behind the rites of human sacrifices. To the ancient Mexicans, the heart was th e seat and symbol of li fe, and bleeding hearts o f men and animals were presented to the Sun-god to maintain him in vigor and enable him to run his course across the sky [11]. Now, when the Israelites turned their backs from worshipping the Lord, they adopted the worship of the pagan gods from their neighbors. And they too were led by pagan high priests"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"to sacrifice human beings. \"They joined themse lves also unto Baalpeor and ate the sacrifices of the dead. Thus they provoked the Lord to ange r with their inventions : and the plague brake in upon them. And they served th eir idols which were a snare un to them. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto DEVILS and shed innocen t blood, even th e blood of thei r sons and their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idol s of Canaan: and the land was p olluted with blood.\" Psalms 106:28, 29, 36-38. The ignorant Israelites we re not sacrificing their children to gods, as they thought, but unto devils. Paul, over 1000 years later, said the sacrifices of the Gentiles which the Israelites adopted were actually \"Sacrifices to Devils.\" \"But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.\" 1.Corinthians 10:20. As history has documented, that greate st object in pagan wors hip was the sun, who was symbolized all over the world as a heavenly bul l [12]. The pagans displayed the cosmic god in their arts as a bull standing on its hind legs with a tail, hoofs and horns, with a man's head and arms, with a threeprong pitchfor k in his hand. So the ancient cosmic symbol of the Sun-god, with hoofs, a tail, horns and a p itchfork, is where we today get our symbol for Satan as having hoofs, a tail, and horns, w ith a pitchfork in his hand. In pagan philosophy, lightning was the mani festation of their god's wrath and an agent o f his punishment. The thunder was the voice of hi s warnings [13]. In ancient Greece, thunde r and lightning were believe d by the worshippers of Zeus to be manifestations of his presence. Any spot struck by lightning be came sacred. The very name \"Zeu s\" (skt. dyaus, \"The Bright Sky\") identifies him as the god of the sky and its phenomena [14]. In Rome he was worshipped as Jupiter, in Scandinavia, Thor, and in Canaan, Baal, the Storm god. Lightning from the sky separates into br anches; hence, the lightning bolt found in the hand of the supreme god of the sky wa s stylized into a pitchfork. Th is was a symbol for his power, as he who controls the lightning bolt. Besides Satan's personation of Christ ju st before Jesus' Second Coming, what other powe r of God is the second beast of Revelation 13:11-17 going to counterfeit through lying wonders? \"And he doeth great wonde rs, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men.\" And this is still future. The prince of the power of the air is also the prince of darkness. Just as the pagan was deceived by Satan in ancien t times, so is the Christian in m odern times. And, if man can learn how to bring electricity down from the sky and harness its energy, how much more could Satan, a supernatural being, who is even called in the Bible \"The Prin ce of the Power of the Air\" (Ephesians 2:2), able to cause destructiv e storms! And not only th is, but also give his followers secret knowledge how to do the same to their enemies. Because the Sun-god was believed to ha ve this power and woul d also give it to his followers, if they were obedient, or woul d zap his enemies with his bolt, the pagans worshipped their gods through fear. In Bible Trut h, it is the goodness of God that turns an evil p erson to worship Him (Romans 2:4). But in pa gan belief, it was the anger of the Storm god, his hatred for man, his unmerciful attributes, that made the pagans bow before him. Not through love, but through fear. Their whole worship revolved around winning the evil one's favor by pacifying him through sacrifice and appeasement. The main features behind the pure demon worship of ancient Babyl on can be seen today by the open worship of the Yezidis of Kurdista n, Armenia, and the Cauc asus. In their pagan worship they believe it is \"Melek Taus,\" who is the De vil, that was the co-c reator of the world [15]. Their religion today is the worship of both Good and Ev il, or Christ and Satan. They have adopted some heretical el ements of Christianity, and so me precepts of Islam. They regard Jesus as an angel in human form and recognize Muhammad as a Prophet with Abraham. They practice circumcision and baptism. Instead of Christ as the creative agent o f the Godhead (Ephesians 3:10), they regard the Devil as the creative agent of the Supreme"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"God, and seek even today to (appease) him as th e author of evil. They also avoid mentioning the name of the Devil in fe ar of offending hi m [16]. We will st udy another religious movement that has the dualism of good and evil to be worshi pped from today's Rock Era a little later. This study should be particularly interesting fo r people who called themselves Christians during the epidemic of the Beatle hysteria. The Yezedis, like most pagans, beli eve their destinies are not determined by a good, loving, kind and gentle God, but by the Evil One, who ha s no mercy, who delights in destroying mankind. They believe that the good God will forgive no ma tter how they regard him. But, it is the Evil One whose favor they must secure. He, as the destructive deity, must be pacified by offering him sacr ifice, penance, and worship. Is this not similar to how multitudes who call themselves Christians are led to worship the Lord of the Scriptures? Is it no t pictured by erring priests and pastors th at God is a vengeful God, who is ever waiting to cast the unrepentant into a burning place of torment, or sent the repentant to purgatory, so they may be tortured by fire until th ey suffer enough to be purified for Heaven? Is it not screamed, dramatized and shouted to congregations about how gruesome are the tortures of them who are now, so they say, in Hell, the burning place of torment? There is hardly a Christ ian denomination that doesn't teach the doctrine of Life After Death or Immortality of the Soul. Bu t the Bible clearly states that no one lives on after death. \"Fo r the living know that they shall die: But THE DEAD KNOW NOT ANYTHING, neither have they any more a reward: for the memory of them is forgotten. Al so their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished: neither have th ey any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.\" Ecclesiastes 9:5,6. If the wicked are tormen ted in Hell Fire as taught by mo st Christian priests and pastors, when the wicked die, would th ey not have some knowledge of the torment they are supposed to be experiencing? \"Whatsoeve r thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might: For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grove, whit her thou goest.\" Ecclesiastes 9:10. If the righteous go to Heaven after deat h as taught in most Christian churches, would they not be praising the Lord? The Bi ble says: \"The Dead Praise Not The Lord, Neither Any That Go Down In Silence.\" Psalms 115:17. If man goes to Heaven at death like most Christian churches tell their members, wouldn't these righteous people have some thoughts or ideas where they are? The Bible says: \"His b reath goeth forth, he returnet h to his earth; in that VE RY DAY HIS THOUGHTS PERISH.\" Psalm 146:4. Some go to the gravesites to talk to thei r dead friends or relative s, but the Bible says: \"His sons come to honour, and he knowet h it not; and they are brought low but he perceiveth it not of them.\" Job 14:21. \"For in death ther e is NO REMEMBRANCE OF THEE, IN THE GRAVE WHO SHALL GIVE THEE THANKS?\" Psalms 6:5. Jesus plainly stated that the dead ar e still in the graves at His Second Coming, not in Heaven: \"Verily, Verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, WHEN THE DEAD SHALL HEAR THE VOICE OF THE SON OF GOD: AND THEY THAT HEAR SHALL LIVE.\" ... \"MARVEL NOT AT THIS: FOR THE HOUR IS COMING, IN WHICH ALL THAT ARE IN THE GRAVES SHALL HEAR HIS VOICE, AND SHALL COME FORTH; they that have done good, unto th e resurrection of life and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.\" John 5:25,28,29. Both the wicked and the righteous are still in their graves . However, there is a Hell Fire where the wicked will surely be destroyed. But th is is still future. This hell fire comes from Heaven, not from some secret place where th e dead are now receiving their punishment. The Devil is not in charge of some secret place called He ll that is under the earth where all the wicked have been thrown. Nor does the Devi l run around with his pi tchfork, sticking and b urning the wicked both day and night. The fire will be from Heaven and will destroy the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"wicked and also the Devil himself. Revelation 20. Peter foretold Christ's Second Coming woul d be in fire: \"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness: but is longsuffering to us-word, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heav ens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall MELT WITH FERVENT HEAT, THE EARTH ALSO AND THE WORKS THAT ARE THEREIN SHALL BE BURNED UP.\" 2.Peter 3:9, 10. David foretold Christ's Second Coming 1,000 years before Jesus was born. In Psalm 50:3- 5, we read: \"Our God shall come , and shall not keep silence: a fire shall de vour before Him, and it shall be tempestuous round about Him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that He may Judge His people. Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.\" Paul also foretold that Jesus would be a consuming fire to thos e who have rejected the Gospel. 2.Thessalonians 1:7-9, \"And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with hi s mighty angels, in flam ing fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and th at obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall b e punished with ever lasting destruction from the presence of the Lor d, and from the glory o f His power.\" In Isaiah 29:6 we read: \"Thou sh alt be visited of th e Lord of hosts with THUNDER, AND WITH EA RTHQUAKE, AND GREAT NO ISE, WITH STORM AND TEMPEST AND THE FLAME OF DEVOURING FIRE.\" The doctrine of the wicked being thrown into ever burning fire cannot be found in eithe r the Old or New Testaments, but it is found on the pages of Su n worship. The Hell Fire Jesus p lainly described in Scripture has two time periods. There are two different times fire and b rimstone shall rain from Heaven. The first shall be at Christ's Second Coming. But the consuming fire that finally dest roys the Devil, his angels, and the wicked will not be until after the 1,000 years described in Revelation 20:1-6, 9, 10. This is when the wicked will be raised from the dead, and Satan will make a last effort to destr oy the New Jerusalem: \"And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the b eloved city; and fire CAME DOWN FR OM GOD OUT OF HE AVEN, AND DEVOURED THEM. AND THE DEVIL THAT DECEIVED THEM WAS CA ST INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE AND BRIMSTONE, WHER E THE BEAST AND THE FA LSE PROPHET ARE, AND SHALL BE TORMENTED DAY AND NIGHT FOR EVER AND EVER.\" Revelation 20:9, 10. This whole earth is going to be covered w ith fire. Fire is a purifying agent. And it will be fire that our Lord will use to purify the ea rth of its pollu tions caused by Satan and man fo r 6,000 years. In the book of Malachi we read the following: \"For behol d, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven: and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it sh all leave them neither root no r branch.\" Malachi 4:1. The Lord destroyed everything in Noah's da y by water; that was just a shadow of the earth when it shall be covered by fire. Peter saw this was to come and said in 2.Peter 3:5,6, \"For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water a nd in the water: Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: But the he avens and the earth, wh ich are now, by the same word are kept in store, re served unto FIRE against the day of judgment and perdition o f ungodly men.\" As stated before, ther e are two periods of this Hell Fire predicted by both the Old Testament Prophets and by the New Testament Apostles. And, there are also to be two resurrections. In Revelation 20:1- 9, it plainly states the resurr ection of the wicked and their destruction will not happen until the 1,000-year millenium is ove r. \"And I saw an angel come"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"down from heaven, having the key of the bottom less pit and a great ch ain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is th e Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottoml ess pit, and shut hi m up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no mo re, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be lo osed a little season. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshi pped the beast, neithe r his image, neither had received his mark upon th eir foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.\" We will study more of this very important doctrine later. Now, among the first inhabitants of the earth, Lucife r's first lie was \"YE SHALL NOT SURELY DIE (Genesis 3:4).\" A nd, this same LIE of the Devil has been used from Adam and Eve's day to our presen t time today. Here lies the origin of the foundation of the falsehood o f immortal soul, reincarnation, all forms of Spir itualism, Astrology, Blac k Magic, Necromancy, Purgatory and Hell, the burning place of torm ent. The whole system of the Mystery o f Iniquity is based on this lie of the Devil, \"L ife after Death.\" But th e Bible is very clear: \"THOU SHALT SURELY DIE.\" Genesis 2:16, 17. Man does not continue to live after death as mo st have been deceived into believing. \"Fo r the living know that they shall die: but th e dead know not anything.\" Ecclesiastes 9:5. As stated before, the myths about \"Lif e After Death\" can be tr aced in the legends o f N imrod who became the great god of the Assyrians and Babylonians [17]. At Nineveh, Austen H. Layard, from the British Museum, uncovered the an cient city and discovered ove r 25,000 tablets describing the ancient history of the Assyrian Empire [18]. Layard found inscriptions at Nineveh that sa id it was Ninus who built the city [10]. The word \"Nineveh\" itself means \"The Habitation of Ninus\"[20]. Bu t it has been discovered that the name Ninus was just a deified name the early Assyrians called Nimrod, because the Bibl e itself says it was N imrod who built Nineveh (Genes is 10:11). Nimrod (Ninus) was said to have been killed, according to the inscriptions, but his \"spirit\" became immortal and fl ew up to the Sun and he became \"Beelsamon,\" \"Lor d of Heaven\"[21]. In all forms of witchcra ft, as in all modern forms today, the doctrine of \"Immortality of the Soul\" was the center of their wh ole pagan belief and worship. Pa gans believed that when they died they took possession of one of the stars in Heaven. The i gnorant pagans, like multitudes of Christians today, believe that the spirits of the dead are \"m inistering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.\" Hebrews 1:14. If the reader has ever read into the hi story of any nation, the hi story of the people shows that their whole culture was su rrounded by the belief in \"Lif e After Death,\" \"Reincarnation,\" and communicating with the dea d. Multitudes of paga n traditions, worl dwide, have thei r origin in the Legends of Nimrod. The Babylonians taught that the fate of everything was de pendent on the sky. The Babylonians, as most ancient people, believed th at each mortal, like the gods, had his own sta r in the Sky [22]. Here we can begin to see why primitive men beli eved their chief gods inhabited the planets and named the planets as the homes of their gods. Saturn (the Roman god of crops) is believed to be the star-god Stephen said th e ancient Israelites worshipped in their apostasy under the name of Remphan [23]. \"Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the Star of your god Rempha n, figures which ye made to wo rship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.\" Acts 7:43, see also Amos 5:26. This will also help us to understand the cosmic religion of Astrology, and how Astrology ties in with Sun worship. Astrol ogy was actually the origin of the pagan sciences and pagan symbols. John, in the book of Re velation, was given this sacr ed number 666 of Astrology to identify who this beast is (see Revelation 13:1-11, and 18) that Je sus warns not to be identified with (Revelation 14:9,10)."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" In the ancient Babylonian astrological system, it is the Su n-god who is the ruler and main god of the zodiac. And all the gods of heaven (the stars) were considered offspring of the sun. According to pagan philosophy, all the star gods you have heard about in school were actually manifestations of the heat, fire and light which flowed from the sun. It was believed that it was the Sun-god who was the source of all things , and all the other gods were but emanations of the sun, \"flesh of his flesh.\" Therefore, all the manifestations of the gods of nature were just manifestations of the one god, the Sun, whose worship by prim itive man was in reality to Satan. Even Lucifer's name means \"Day Star,\" the \"Illuminated One,\" or \"Shining One\"[24]. The Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, Roma ns, Hindus and American Indians, like the Babylonians, all believed that th eir gods were just representati ons of the one god. The ancient people, shortly after the fl ood, had a knowledge of the True God of Noah, Shem, and Abraham. But the worship of the True G od of Noah, Shem, and Abraham soon became perverted into idolatry by the larger populati on when Nimrod tried to unite the whole world into a One World Government. And this anti -God movement shall be attempted by some modern Nimrods in our time! Both history and the Bibl e reveal that the greatest mystery to mankind has always been the Universe. And Satan, the Prince of the Power of the Air, used man's curiosity about the heavenly host to cause man to worship them instead of their Creator . \"And the children o f Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord a nd served Baalim (the Sun-god).\" Judges 2:11. The word Baalim is a te rm to describe the whole system of Sun worship. Augustine said in his book, The City of God, that all the learned pagan doctors declar ed that all th e chief gods o f the Greek-Roman world were 'one and the same love,' and that al l the stars were part of love and had rational souls [25]. All the chief gods of Greece and Rome were the same gods worshipped in Babylonia, Assyria, Egypt, Persia , and North and South Am erica [26]. Only the names were different, like th eir languages and cultures were. It was from Ba bylon (Babel) that Sun worship started. And, it is also where all ancient and mode rn nations today receive thei r system of Astrology [27]. In pagan philosophy, the stars controlled th e affairs of the human race. Hence, the science of Astrology claims to interpret the will of the star gods . The chief star gods of the pagans were the gods of Astrology, which were believed to be just emanations of the one god, the Sun-God [28], the ruler of the Zodiac. Astrology is the foundation of all the pagan sciences o f the occult, whose author is Lucifer, and his sp irit guides are his angels . Spiritualism, which is just another name for Witchcra ft, is today, among the young, the bi ggest rival of Jesus Christ. It will be through Spiritualism that men and women will co me with all manner of lying wonders that will gather the whole world under Satan's banner. \"Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or th ere, believe it not. Fo r there shall arise fa lse Christs and false prophets, and shall show great si gns and wonders; inso much that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.\" Matthew 24:23,24. Spiritualism (Witchcraft) will deceive the whol e world into accepti ng a strong delusion that will bring Satan to finall y use his crowning deception that will cause most to lose thei r salvation. Lucifer, this Old Serpent, called the Devil, will personate Jesus Christ just before the real Christ comes the Second Time. This wi ll be Satan's last ef fort to destroy mankind. However, students of the Bible, who have made Scripture their only standard to judge between truth and error, will not be fooled into worshipping Satan as Christ. For the satanic movement to unite the world under one banner a nd Christ walking upon this earth again is a complete contradiction of Scripture. But to actually understand any of this, the reader must not be ignorant of Satan's devices ; so we need to examine what the Bible says Spiritualism or, what Witchcraft is. This we will stud y in Part II of this Cha p ter."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"1. The modern term for witchcraft taught in Colleges today. 2.

The Bible warns it will be demons, us ing people as their instru ments, that will lea d others into rejecting the True Christ. \"For they are the spirit s of DEVILS, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gath er them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.\" Revelation 16:14. There is absolutely nothing romantic about Satan. He will give some power to wor k miracles, but this is his way of deceiving. Just as God uses man to lead others to Him, so does Satan. However, unlike God, once Satan has us ed a person for his own purposes, Satan will cast away all whom he has used to deceive others, like a man casts away his trash into the trash can. So to help a Bible st udent avoid falling into any of Satan's traps, one can learn from the Scriptures and from those whom Satan has already used, how not to become another one of his victims. To start, we need to study again the fi rst deception at the Garden of Eden. As we state d b efore, the Devil uses camouflages to keep his worship hidden. Th e Sun and Nimrod were only a front used by Lucifer to get multitude s to bow before him. However, the first camouflage he used to deceiv e Adam and Eve was the serpent. The very thing Satan used to deceive Adam and Eve became eventually one of the most sacred symbols of Sun worship! Instead of the serpent as being a symbol of Sa tan and deception, as th e Bible instructs, the serpent became a symbol of th e \"Great Benefactor and Heal er\" of mankind. The serpent was worshipped as the \"God of Healing\" and \"Lif e-Restorer.\" \"YE SHALL NOT SURELY DIE,\" Genesis 3:3, was Lucifer's first lie to our first parents. The serpent, the god of healing, was generally represented in the pagan arts entwined on a stick, staff or a st ock of a tree [1]. Here we find the origin of the strange symbol that the American Medical Association (AMA) uses today. This medical insignia wa s originally the symbol of the Egyptian god Hermes, who we will see in a moment was Nimrod's father, Cush. And it's here we find the origin of the wor d hermetic. This ancient word f ound in classical literature actua lly derived from the ancient Egyptian god of medicine. This name is actually Ch aldean and the Greeks and Egyptians adopted this god from the Babylonians. The ve ry word hermetic means the hidden knowledge of magic, occult sciences, et c [2]. Not only was the serpent worshipped by the ignorant pagans as \"The Great Benefactor\" fo r mankind, the serpent ironically enough was worshipped also as"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"\"The Great Enlightener.\" What did Satan say to Adam and Eve besides, \"Ye shall not surely die?\" In Genesis 3:5 we read: \"FOR GO D DOTH KNOW THAT IN THE DAY YE EAT THEREOF THEN YOUR EYES SHALL BE OP ENED, AND YE SHALL BE AS GODS, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.\" In The Two Babylons, by Hislop, p. 227, we read the following: \"Along with the sun, as the great fire-god, and, in due time, identified with him, was the serpent worshipped. In the mythology of the pr imitive world, says Owen, 'the serpent is universally the symbol of the sun. In Egypt, one of the commone st symbols of the sun, or sun god, is a disc with a serpent ar ound it. The original reason of th at identificati on seems just to have been that, as the sun was the great enlightener of the phy sical world, so the serpent was held to have been the great enlightener of the spiritual, by giving mankind the 'Knowledge o f Good and Evil.' ' \" The ancient Mayans of th e Yucatan in Mexico worshipped the serpent go d under the name of Can. Can means \"serpent\" in the Mayan language, as Can or A-Can was the ancient Sumerian and ancient Scottish word for serpent. Here we find the origin of our wor d canny, shrewd or serpent-like. The Babylonians worshipped Can the serpent and Vul, the god of fire. The Romans simply combined the tw o words into 'Vulcan,\" the Roman god of fire from when also comes our wo rd \"volcano\" [3]. This seem s to be how the Mayans an d Mexicans named their gods. They too combined two words to descri be their serpent god. \"Kulkul\" means \"beautiful bird,\" and \"Can,\" serpent. Hence, \"Kulkulcan,\" which means \"Bir d Serpent\" in the Mayan language. This is th e exact same meaning for Quetzalcoatl, the Mexican pagan messiah in central Mexico [4]. Interestingly enough, the cosmic symbol for Quetzalcoatl wa s a feathered serpent! Here is another interesting observation. The origin of the word \"Vatican\" also derived from two words. The Latin word \"vatic\" or \"vatis\" mean s \"prophet or soothsay er\" [5]. The combine d word, \"Vatican,\" appears to mean \"divination by the serpent\"! The symbol for Astrology is often shown in pagan arts as a serpent in a circular position with his ta il in his mouth. This represented eternal life. There is the strong evidence from Scriptur e that the serpent originally had wings and flew, instead of having legs as the evolutionists sa y. The Scriptures reveal it was a curse for the serpent to travel on his belly as he does now. \"And the Lord God said unto the serpent, b ecause thou hast done this, t hou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field: upon thy bell y shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.\" Genesis 3:14. Hence, that feathered serpent that has b een displayed in pagan arts and worshipped as the god of healing, is none other bu t \"that Old Serpent, called th e Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world.\" Revelation 12:9. While Satan changed the image of the serpent into someth ing to be adored and worshipped, the goat, from antiquity, sym bolized the Devil. The goat, known for its agility, stubborn character and having its own wa y, is what Astrologers say pe ople are who are born under the sign of Capricorn, the He-Goat. Witches in the Middle Ages were widely reputed to worship the Devil in the form of a goat [6]. During the Middle Ages there wa s a widespread witch p anic that produced witch hunts and witch trials. Witches were often charged with poisonings and other injuries as well as murder. The ch arge of murder might have been derived from making a wax image of a hated person and consuming it over a slow fire or sticking it with p ins. African witchdoctors, Haitian experts in Voo-Doo, and American Indian medicine men indulged in this Satanic Black Art. The Middle Ages witch tr ials record how multitudes o f witches confessed, under torture, that they held local meetings called covens to adore thei r master, make plans to execute the diabolic wi ll, and partake in best ial rites. In southern Europe the site where the witches met was called a synagogue; in Germany it was called a b locksberg [7]. These meetings usually took pl ace at midnight. It wa s brought out during the trials that witches claimed they came to thei r meetings by being carrie d by the De vil: others"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"were able to fly by anointing th emselves with oils from the bodi es of murdered infants; still others rode broomsticks , or a cow or a goat. At the re ndezvous Satan appeared as a blac k animal, often a goat, or as a man with cloven feet [8]. Th ere are many diff erent sects in modern witchcraft today; howev er, modern day witches do not be lieve that the Devil exists. They are not Satanist old wome n with long black hair and a wa rt on their nose. A Christian will be shocked to know that ancient Witchcraft has been revived and modernized among the young people today. And, it is the religion of some of those w ho control the wealth of the world! Their covens (churches) are today Fe derally recognized tax exempt churches, an d enjoy the same rights under the protection of th e law as do the Christians. And, believe it o r not, there are millions of both male and female witches here in the United States alone. Witchcraft is the bigge st rival religion of Ch ristianity in England and America [9]. It is interesting enough, however, that th ese modern witches exalt the horn gods and the p agan goddesses such as the Egyptian pagan trinity Osiris, Isis, Horus, which originated in the worship of Nimrod (the Sun), his wife Semiramis (the moon) , and Tammuz (the Morning Star). Like their pagan brethr en, modern day witches are ignoran t to the fact th at these gods do not exist. Even though they clai m the Devil does not exist, they too are in reality bowing thei r knee before him. They exalt the gods Satan hi d behind to deceive the ancient nations. Pan o r Bacchus is another god the witches exalt and wo rship. It depends on what coven they belong to. Anyway, how was this ancien t pagan god displayed in pagan art? He had a man's head with horns and cloven feet! Now witchcraft, as stated before, has been modernized. Modern day witches who worship the gods of cosmic forces claim now to work ma gic and cast spells fo r the general good of the community. This kind of witchcraft is called white magic. Those who practice casting spells that injure people practice what is known as Black Magic. However, most of these modern day w itches claim to be good witches as in The Wizard o f Oz, and unlike medieval witchcra ft that made an image out of wax to stick pins in it so the p erson the wax imag e looked like would die, these mode rn day witches claim now that this wax image is used to heal peopl e. This revised and modern form of witchcraft is called today Wicca, which is the feminine fo rm of an Old English word, \"Wi cce,\" meaning -- \"Witch\" [10]. The main feature of Wicca is, however, nature worship. Just as the ancient Baal worshippers in Babylonia believed it was th e cosmic Star gods that were responsible for pouring out the rain from Heaven and caused fertility among the plants a nd mankind, so do these ignorant p eople in these modern witch covens teach their little ones these things. The word Baal, so often seen throughout the Old Testament, was used to describe a god. The word means \"Lord\" or \"Mas ter\" [11] and in the Bible it was the name for the Sun-god. Now, kings of pagan na tions often were considered the incarnation of the Sun-god, and to identify with the Sun-god the king s would adopt the name of his god as Jezebel's father did in 1.Kings 16:31. His name was \"Ethbaal\" which means \"with Baal\" or \"Baal's man\" [12]. Just as ancient Sun-ki ngs pretended to be the ancient incarnation of the Sun-god, so does modern witchcraft teac h that the High Priest is the pe rsonification of the horned god Pan, o r Osiris. And, the High Prieste ss of these covens, like an cient Sun worship, is the p ersonification of Isis, Diana, or one of the other names this pagan goddess has throughout the world. Baal worship was basically a fertility cult that taught its followers that the Sun-god and Moon-goddess controlled the seas ons, brought fertility, etc. Here we find the origin of the beliefs of Wicca. Witches, ancient and m odern, take off their cl othes during their meet ings as a symbol o f freedom, and so the power they say they receive fr om their gods can fr eely flow from thei r b odies. A circle is drawn to contain and concen trate the power the witc hes claim to receive through lewd dancing and chanting. On nights of the full moon and other festivals, the High Priest of witchcraft performs a ritual known as \"Drawing Do wn the Moon.\" This is taught to"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"new members to explain how the High Priestess becomes th e incarnation of the Moongoddess [13]. Witches believe that the build-up of power is achieve d much more readily when the p articipants are naked, and when a certain sexual tension is present. Wh en these witches reach the power they want charged in their atmosphere, they begin to cast their spells. They claim the spells should always be for the good; an evil spell, they say, rebounds threefold upon the head of its creator . After their spells are cast, the witches settle down to a ceremony that is similar to the holy communion held for the Egyptian god Osiris . However, instead of a roun d disk wafer that was an Egyptia n symbol of the sun, some mode rn day witches make cakes in the shape of a five pointed star called the Pentag ram. This to the occultist is one of the most p owerful weapons in magic. The Pentagram sy mbolism is based on that of the number five which according to Astrology, stands for the living world of nature, such as Air, Fire, Water, Earth, and the Spirit of their god and pa gan goddess who used the elements, according to witchcraft, to create the Universe. The number five in Astrol ogy also represents the four direct ions and the center, for the five senses (smell, taste, sight, touch and hearing). Witchcraft, like all forms of Spiritualism, teaches man is a microcosm (miniature universe); man is the ruler of nature, and as th e miniature image, the potential master of all things [14]. So, the Pentagram (five pointed star) with one of its points projecting upwards is imagined in Witchcraft as a ma n's body with arms and legs exte nded, and is a symbol of the dominance of the divine spirit. It is used as a magical weapon fo r invoking good influences and keeps the evil spirits at bay, say those who practice white magic. Many of our youth reject the religion of the Bible, a nd now worship the created things instead of the Creator through th is new modern form of Witchc raft because Witchcraft today is attractive and has taken on a br ighter look. Instead of the sata nic evil looking people of the Middle Ages, the witches of t oday have been, for the past century, portrayed as good people, who fight against the ev il forces of this world, such as \"Wonder Woman,\" with her sign o f white magic (the Pentagram) di splayed on her forehead. But to distinguish the bad witches from the good witches, say the occultists, a re versed Pentagram with two points upward is a symbol of Black Magic, and of those who do worship the Devi l. The two points of the sta r p ointed upwards suggests the horns of the Devil symbolized as a goat attacking the Heavens with his horns [15]. This five pointed star which has two poi nts upward was, and is today, worn as an amulet by open Devil worshippe rs, and by many mode rn day magicians an d wizards. Originally this evil sign was worn to show Satan that they had chosen him as thei r leader [16]. Is this not chilling and frightening to know that multit udes of women of high fashion may not be aware that when they wear that little gold chain ar ound their neck, with this five p ointed star with two points upw ard, they are showing they have chosen the Devil's side, an d seek his protection? Is it not chilling to know that they who call themselves Freemasons, an d the ladies who call themselves \"The Order of the Ea stern Star\" display this evil sign in thei r lodges? We will study even more shocking truths about the orig in and purpose of these Secret Societies in the next chapter. As stated earlier, there are many sect s of modern witchcraft today, and many variations found in their rituals. In some covens the cakes they use in their communi on are made into the shape of a crescent, which is the symbol of the Moon-goddess. These cakes, by the way, are made of salt, honey, wi ne, meal, oil and, in some cove ns, blood. They are eaten in honour o f the Egyptian god Horus [17] or wh atever god the coven exalts. In ancient witchcraft the cakes were r ound with a cross drawn on them that represented the first letter of the name of the ancient dead and risen paga n messiah \"Tammuz,\" who was the incarnation of the Sun-god and th e son of the Moon-goddess (the Queen of Heaven). Even the Israelites, when they turned from the worshi p of our Creator made these same cakes that"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"honoured the pagan queen of Heaven and her god-child Tammuz. In Jeremiah 7:18 our Lor d condemned this ancient ritual in the worship of these cosmic gods. \"The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire , and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out dr ink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.\" Today, the Roman Catholic Church dedica tes these same cakes to the Virgin Mary whom they ironically call the Queen of Heaven [18] . These cakes are called by Roman Catholic \"Hot Cross Buns\" [19]. The name of this pagan goddess the Isr aelites worshipped and dedicate d these cakes to is found in Judges 2:13. Her name to the Israelites was Ashtaroth. To the early Romans her name was Venus, the goddess of love. Witchcraft is just anot her word for Spiritualism, but the modern word used to cover-up the evil name of Witchcraft so it may be taught in Colleges is \"Parapsychology.\" Now, to understand this other abomination found in both ancient and modern Witchcraft, the reade r must understand that it was the Sun-god and Moon-goddess who created the whole Universe, according to these witches. To honour this paga n belief, a ritual calle d \"The Great Rite\" is strictly observed among these socalled \"good\" wi tches. Since the High Priest in a coven is believed to be the incarnation of Pan, the Sun-god, and the High Priestess is the incarnation o f the Queen of Heaven, the Moon -goddess, these two m imic the myth in th e creation of the Universe by the Sun-god and the Moon-goddess when they perform \"The Great Rite\" ritual, which is engaging in sacred prostitution. This is ju stified by the witches on the grounds of fertility, because after all, they say, Wicca is a fertility cult [20]. To try to understand any of this perversion so you can teach others how to avoid it, the reader simply needs to realize that this abominable practice of sacred prostitution found today in modern witchcraft is nothi ng new. All ancient heathen wors hip of the Sun-gods had within its philosophies Phallicism. What is Phallicism? It is the ve neration and worship of male an d female sex organs. The union of male and female organs is symbolized in witchcraft as a point within a circle, and also as two triangles uniting to make a \"Hexagram\" [21] better known today as the \"Star of David.\" Th e truth is, King David of Israel never carried this emblem that is now the symbol of Is rael. This emblem was adopted from witchcraft by some Jewish priests who had explored deep into the Babylonian religion during their captivity in Babylon. From here sprang witchcraft in another garb called the Cabala. The Mexican Indian, centuries before se eing a white man, had the Hexagram as the symbol of their phallic worship of th e cosmic gods. Often the Hexagram is displayed as a symbol o f the 7 planets that serpentine their way through the Zodiac. The Sun in the center is displaye d in a circle with a point in its center. Usually before these modern day witche s partake of the cake and wine to honour Horus o r Pan, as we examined in part one of this chap ter, a ceremony for any new initiates into thei r coven is performed. This involved blindi ng, binding, and whipping new members for the p urpose of purification. However, this ceremony is not as brutal as in medieval covens; they are good witches, so the whip th ey use now is said to be of embroidered silk. However, those p resent with sadomasochistic tendencies might be satisfied. The fo llowing five-fold kiss b estowed by the High Priest or Prie stess on the feet, knees, genita ls, breasts and lips of a new member speaks for itself [22]. In Man, Myth and Magi c, An Illustrated En cyclopedia of the Supe rnatural, Vol. 14, p. 1867, Cavendish, we read the following: \"Only three pieces of magi c can be performed at each meet ing, they claim, and the spells should always be for the good; an evil spe ll rebounds threefold upon the head of its creator. Sometimes the spell is cast telepathically: for in stance, in the case of a spell cast to cure a p erson of a bad leg the witches would stand si lently and 'will' the leg to heal. On othe r occasions they might use a doll, or 'fith-fath,' to represent the sick person - bathe the doll's leg"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"with a healing potion, or the high priestess might 'bind' th e spell, wrapping her girdle aroun d the blade of her athame in a special way.\" How popular has this modern witchcraft become? In the Sept ember 12th, 1982 Arkansas Democrat \"Family Weekly,\" Ge orgia Frontiere appeared on th e front page. Georgia inherite d the Los Angeles Rams when her late (sixth) hus band drowned in the ript ides off the Florida coast in April 1979. He was 72. But what we really are interested in bringi ng to your attention is her openness about being able, says she, to talk to her d ead husband's spirit, and how she dabbles in the occult. On page 11 of the Sept. 12 issue we read the following: \"Georgia gives N olan Cromwell on unasked for raise ... and Georgia, who dabbl es in the occult (she says she's talked to Carroll's spirit), mysterious ly waves a hand at half-time over Haden's injure d leg, which is believed to be broken. 'I thought for sure she wa s nuts,' Haden says. 'Then, incred ibly, after the doctors told me they were sure it was broken, the X-rays were negative.' \" Why are more and more people coming out publicly and admitting to be connected with Spiritualism? About 25 years ago they would be afraid to make such statements for fear o f p ublic ridicule and harm. Howeve r, most Christians never h eard of the Fraudulent Mediums Act of 1951 which only applies to those who obtain money fro m the public under the pretext of possessing supernatural power. This allows those who really can perform these lying wonders to practice their arts legally in the ope n for the first time in hundreds of years [23]. Most witches, because they believe in the immortality of the soul, teach that every human b eing has a spirit guide that they can contact for advice. This is also where the Psychics claim their advice and information co mes from. These departed souls, they say, are the spirits o f loved ones, ancient Indian Ch iefs, or Egyptian, Hindu, or Chin ese Sages, or Wise Men from p ast ages. These spirits, they say, have mu ch wisdom because the spirit guides have experienced many reincarnations and have mast ered the lessons they were meant to learn while on earth, and now have the power to benefit the livng [24]. As we already read from Scriptures, the doctrine of \"Life After Death,\" or the belief in an immortal soul is a lie from the Devil. But the miracles and spells that some witches have are very real. They may not know it, but they receive their power fr om Devils who, after they use them to deceive other humans, will de stroy the very ones they have used. However, a person who has chosen the teachings of Jesus Christ, and made His Spirit a guide through a knowledge of the Scriptures, knows that these spirit guides are not spirits o f p ast Sages, but spirits of dev ils impersonating th em. And, the believer who has chosen the God of the Bible is pr omised protection from those who practice V oodooism and spell casting. In Numbers 23:23 we read: \"Surely there is no ENCHANTMENT (Witchery) against Jacob, neither is there any DIVINA TION against Israel.\" As established earlier, th e ancient pagans believed that wh en they died their souls flew up to the Heavens and took possession of one of th e stars. The chief gods of the Zodiac, which were but emanations of the Sun-god, all HAD A SACRED NUMBER. Space does not allow us to examine all of these numbers in Astr ology. However, to help us understand why this mysterious number 666 was given to John the A postle in Revelation 13:18, warning us not to be identified with it, it is necessary now to examine some ancient pagan numerology. Ancient Astrology teaches that one of the sacred numbers of the Chief god of the Zodiac (the sun) was the number one. The Sun symbol , we saw earlier, was a Heavenly Bull and a serpent. Since Babylon was the bi rth place of Astrology a nd the rest of Idol atry, we will see how this Babylonian system of gods and goddesses spread throughout the ancient world an d has penetrated into modern culture today. Originally, the letters of the various alphabets had, and still have to some extent, a numerical significance. The Engl ish language has lost track of this, for there are no numbers that identify with each letter of our alphabet. But, the first letter of the alphabet in many languages still carries with it a reference to th e Sun-god (one) whose main symbol was either a"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"serpent or a bull. Take, for instan ce, the first letter in the Hebr ew and Chaldee alphabet. It was a symbol of a bull [25]. The Greek word aleph (alpha ) is the name of the first letter in their alphabet, and it means bullor ox. It is interesting to note that the ever-revered bullgod of the Orient (the elephant) has the same root (eleph) in his name, and almost every Hindu te mple has its phallic idol to commemorate the lifegiving qualit ies of their god (one). So to honour the Sun, the god (one), the Heavenly Bull-god, the first da y of the week [26] (Sunday) a nd the first of everything was dedicated to the bull-god as sacr ed. The first day of the month, the first day of the year, the first born son and the first frui ts of the harvest and of the flocks, were kept sacred an d dedicated to him. Indeed, most Christians cast away the original day of the worship described in Genesis 2:1- 3 (before Jews were ever hear d of) for the observance of Sunda y, the first day of the week! We will investigate this mystery later. The number 2 in ancient Astrology is cons idered a female number and a symbol for the Mother goddess who, according to pagan belief, is the s econd member of the godhead. However, pagan philosophy teaches that the num ber 2 was thought upon as an evil number. In ancient paganism, women were considered as ev il and the cause of death. Some scholars claim that our very word, evil, is eve-il. The name of the second letter of the He brew Chaldean alphabet is Beth, a feminine prope r name which means house. The moon, which is th e symbol of the Moth er goddess, is eve r considered as the monthly house of the Sun in Astrology. The number 3 is a sacr ed number identified with the pagan godhead of Baal, Ishtar an d Tammuz. Sometimes the number 3 represented a tr iple aspect of the Sun-god as the ruler o f Heaven. While the sun appeared in the sky it wa s symbolized as a Heavenly Bull. The Serpent was the symbol of the sun in the spiritual real m of things.\" However, when the sun sinks into the Western ocean at the end of the day and spends the night in the realm of darkness and the dead, he then becomes the fish god, Lord of the Underworld. The Fish-god to the Babylonians, Assyrians, and Philistines was Dagon. This name Dagon, li ke Kulkulcan of the Mayans, is derived by combining two words. Da g means Fish, and On means Sun. Hence, the p art man and part fish gods worshipped in the Old World. To the Romans he was Neptune who was ever displayed in ancient Roman arts as part man, part fish, with a pitchfork in his hand. It was during a festival to celebrate the capture of Sams on and to give thanks to Dagon for delivering Samson into the Philistines' hands that Samson pulled down the house in which the Philistines were celebrating, on himself a nd three thousand Philistines. Judges 16:23-31. It is an interesting obs ervation that the High Priest of Dagon wore a robe and a mitre that resembled a fish. This mitre the pagan priests wore is the origin of the mitre the Popes an d Cardinals wear today. This mitre that resemble s a fish head was worn centuries before the birth of Christ by pagan High Priests of Dagon [28]. In India, their trinity is based on the 3 phases of the Sun-god. When the sun rises in the East, he is Brahama, wh en he gains his meridian , he is Siva, and when he sets in the West, he b ecomes Vishnu. This explains why the gods of the orient sometimes were displayed with three heads and three pairs of arms on one bod y. Many pagans believed in the three aspects o f the Sun-god, who has 3 phases in which he travels across the sky. Hence, the number 3 in Astrology represents the trinity in Witchcraft. The number 4 is the sacred number in Astr ology for the Sun as Ruler of the four quarters o f the Universe, or the four divisions of the Zodiac, the four seasons, and the four directions. It is interesting to note the name of Tammuz, where the cross or iginally came from. It was originally the initial T in Tammuz, which was known as the sacred Tau. The cross was a symbol of the sun worshippers centuries before Jesus was born. The number 4 itself is little more than a cross. Take away the angular bar and we have a cr oss. As the reader probably has observed, no Catholic will pray a prayer or wo rship God until he make s the four directions"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"across his head and body to resemble it. That which is now called th e Christian cross was originally the mystic Tau that the Chaldeans us ed to sacrifice a first born child to the Sun-go d [29]. And, it was this very thing that was us ed to crucify Jesus on. No greater insult coul d Satan give to Christ than to sacrifice Him on his own symbol of heathen worship. We have already explor ed some of the reasoning behind the number 5 in Astrology such as the 5 pointed star (Pentagram), but it is the number 6 that s hould capture our close attention. The hidden meaning and symbols represented by the number 6 are so involved that an entire b ook could be written about this number and its origin. Here again, we explore the worship o f the serpent, because the number SIX has ever been connected with the serpent. It is interesting to note that man and the serpent, along with the other land animals, were created on the sixth day (Genesis 1:24-31). The wo rds used to say SIX, sex in Latin, seis in Spanish, seks in Norwegian, shest in Portugue se, sechs in German and sas in Chaldean- Hebrew, as in most languages, start with the lett er S. The letter S deri ved, believe it or not, from a pictograph of a cobra, erected in its striking position. The hissing sound of the letter S represented the voice of the serpent. We can note that snake, serpent a nd Satan begin with the serpent letter S. On the heads of cobras ther e are usually distinct markings in the shape o f letters. They are V, U and 0. Hence, the ancien ts invented names for different serpents with these letters, such as the U in Uraeus. That was the Egyptian na me for their sacred Asp, which ever appears on the forehead, or crown, of the Pharoah, who cla imed to be the vicar, or the earthly incarnation, of his god [30]. The O occurs in the Greek Ophis, the na me of the serpent whom the Gnostics worshipped. During their celebration of thei r Lord's Supper, they let a sn ake, whom they called Ophis, crawl over their bread. They became know n in history as the Ophites [31]. In the Greek numerical sy stem the symbol S is called th e sigma, and was originally the sixth letter of the Greek alphabet . It was also represented as the number six. However, today the letter S, or sigma in Greek, has a numbe r significance of 200. With the dropping of the sacred sigma from the sixth position in the Greek alphabet , it appears the Ethioptic and some other alphabets did the same thing with their 6th letter. This has been one of the most baffling mysteries to people who have studied into the origin of the alphabets. No one seems to know why the ancients did this. The Z or Zeta, used everywhere to stand for 7, fell into the 6th p osition, and is used in the mysteries of the oc cult for both 6 and 7. Remember this, because it is important to know to be able to unlock secr et symbols that hide, or add to, the number 666. Why should so much importance be attached to this number 666? The answer is found in Revelation 13:17,18, that no man might buy or sell unless he identify with the Mark of the Beast, or the Name of the Beast, or identi fy with the number of his Name, 666. This prophecy is still future, but if the reader is found identified with these th ings he or she will be destroye d b y Christ Himself. (Revelati on 14:9,10). We will find the origin of this number of doom, 666, shortly. The numbers 6 and 7 are often interchang eable. This confusion is probably where we get our expression today, \"At sixes and sevens,\" a term meaning confusion. The Greek numerical system is certainly \"At sixes and sevens\" wh en it comes to these two numerical symbols. When we study the origin of the number 7 we see that the number 7 stood, from the time o f Babylon on, for the Giant Serpent of the sky [ 32] whose 7 heads were a symbol of the 7 fatecontrolling planets which serpentine their way through the Zodiac in the Babylonian astrological system. Here we begin to see w hy the Apostle John, in the book of Revelation, symbolized Satan and his astrol ogical religion as a seven head ed serpent (Dragon), attacking the woman, which is a symbol of God's True Church. \"And ther e appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold A GREAT RED DR AGON, HAVING SEVEN HEADS AND TEN HORNS, and seven crowns upon hi s head.\" Revelation 12:3. The Scriptures themselves show that the cosmic seven head ed Dragon is a symbol of Satan. \"And the GREAT DRAGON was cast out, that OLD SERPENT called the Devil and Satan,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"which deceiveth the whole world: He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\" Revelation 12:9. Now in Revelation 17:1-5 we observed earlier that Myster y, Babylon the Great, the Mothe r of Harlots is riding a Seven Headed Beast. Howe ver, this is not a Dragon (Devil), but a beast which in symbolic language represents a \"Pol itical Power.\" See Da niel 7:1-8, 17, 23 and 24. We will study more about how a beast in Bi ble prophecy is a symbol of \"Political Power\" further on. It will also be shown later on that this beast from the bottomless pit with seven heads an d ten horns is Satan's last politic al movement that will try to unite the world under one banner. As we already established, the serpent wa s ever displayed in the pagan arts as an emblem of the Sun-god. It is eye opening to learn that even many of th e names used for the Sun-gods actually add to 666. For instance, all the avat ars (incarnations) of the Sun-god, which were ten, according to the Hindu beli ef were called Buddhas or Rase es of the Siun, or Sun. The Greek word to describe the Buddhas, or Rasees , is Xiuv. This means Wisdom of the Sun, o r Solar Wisdom. In the ancient Greek language, th is word to describe avatars of the Sun adde d to 666 [33].  X=600 I=10 U=6 N=50 with a total of 666 We will see more names of pagan gods that add to 666 as we go on. But first, we need to know more about the origin of the number 6, how some of our letters today derived from this number, and how letters were used in the Babylonian my steries to hide the number 666. We have noted that S is the initial of mo st words used for SIX. In several Greek dialects, the S was replaced by F which the Greeks called Bau, Vau, etc. If you take away the cross ba r on F, it too resembles a snake in striking pos ition. There is a very striking resemblance b etween S, F, and V. It can ne ver be understood why the occultis ts used these letters in thei r mysteries, unless the reader remembers the S, F, and V represent the number SIX. V is the 6th letter in the Hebrew-Chaldean family of alphabets. F replaces it in Western alphabets an d it must be noted as stated before, like 6 and 7, F and V ar e ever interchangeable. Take fo r instance \"knife\" and \"knives.\" Another letter that is a serpent symbol in Greek was the letter M. This letter represents, in the mysteries, the number 12, and is the 12th lett er of the Greek alphabet. M is frequently use d for the letter S because it is just a sigma on its side. Now if M is but a sigma on its side a nd refers to the second 6, or 12th, letter, it woul d appear significant that the sym bol for the letter following the sigma should be nothing more than a Z or Zeth on its side. In the mysteries of paganism the second six (M) or the number 12 stands for the Zodiac. As we have seen, the dropping of the s acred sigma as the sixth lette r numeral causes the Z to drop back into the sixth place. However, like the letter S, the Z also resembles a hissing sound, so the ancients neve r lost the significance of the number 6. Now since history says our letters F, M, S, V, and Z derived from th e ancient pictures of a serpent in his striking position, and have the numerical value of SIX in most other alphabets, we now might be able to understand the symbolic language. Just as a number in our present numerical system has pla ce values, such as 6 written alone equals six, two sixes together equals sixty-six, and three si xes together would equal six hundred sixty-six, so did the ancient learned doctors of witchcraft use the le tters S, V, Z or the other serpentine letters to hide the number 666. Just as Freemasons have secret signs and grips to let each other know they are Masons, so did the learned docto rs of witchcraft let each othe r know who they were by camoufl aging this sacred number 666. Only the learned pagan knew the significance. The number 666 was written in serpentine letters lik e SSS, VVV, ZZZ = 666. They also arranged the letters different ways; sometimes th ey would turn them upside down o r sideways. The SSS sometimes could be seen with a line drawn through the middle of all three S's and turned sideways. This is the origin of the popular amulet called the Oriental cross. Another way the number 666 was hidden whic h can be unmasked, is in learning the origin"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"of the trident sign. Earlier we learned that the Sun-god's wea pon was the lightning bolt and it was stylized into a pitchfork. Th e pitchfork had three prongs to it, hence, we have today the trident sign, which by the way is used to symbolize the number 666 also. Beware of these schemes to deceive, for it is still not clear how this number of doom, 666, will keep God's people from buying and selling. It is not only the Mark of the Beast, which we will study in the last chapter, that will pr event God's people from buying and selling, but also the number of his name ( 666). Revelation 13:17, 18. However, we can trace the origin of th e number 666. And this num ber of doom is derive d out of Astrology. The Zodiac is a narrow band about 18° width making a complete circuit o f the sky around the earth. As we noted before, this was symbolized in pagan arts by a serpent with his tail in his mouth form ing a circle. This represented to the occultist endless time o r eternal life [34]. As we established earlier, astrology taught that the fate of manki nd was ever decided by the p osition of the stars. Now the chief gods of th e Zodiac were the 7 planets who serpentine d their way through the 36 rooms of the Zodiac. Th e 7 planets travel through the narrow band o f the Zodiac at varying speeds. The Zodiacal band itself was divided into 12 houses, one fo r each month of the year , and each house was divided into th ree rooms, making 36 rooms in all, one for each 10° of the Zodiacal circle\" [35]. Here we find th e origin of our present time- keeping. Believe it or not, the dial of a cloc k is derived from the 12 houses of the Zodiac. Thus the Zodiac was a Heaven ly Clock with which today we measure time. Here's anothe r interesting fact: It was not by chance that our ruler has 12 inches to a foot. Both of these systems of measuring time a nd length were based upon the 12 hous es of the Zodiac. It was not b y chance we have 12 units to a dozen. Here we ca n find the origin of the \"Chance of Fate.\" It is not by chance that the original Roulette wheels have a 360\" circle with 36 divisions of 10\" each, with a blank or zero division to repr esent the 5 days beyond the 360 days in a year. It is not by chance that there are 36 numbered cards in a 52 card deck. One card each represents the 52 weeks with 12 face cards, f our Kings, four Queens, a nd four Jacks, and fou r suits, that represent the four seasons. Why do you suppose fortune tellers use a deck of cards to p redict the future? Because the deck of ca rds is derived from As trology! Burn them! It is not by chance that our present townsh ips are composed of 36 square miles, for several writers point out that the ancients divided the earth according to the di visions in the sky. Just as truly as our 12 inch ruler was once a sym bol of the 12 house Zodi ac, so is our 36 inch yardstick based upon the 36 rooms into which the heavenly houses were divided. Now, the entire remainde r of the sky outside of the Zodiacal band was also divided into 36 constellations, 15 on the south si de and 21 on the north side. A god of each constellation was appointed to rule over one of th e 36 rooms of the Zodiac. Every star in the sky was considere d as a god and the abode of departed spirits and was include d in a constellation, over whom was appointed a god who ruled over a Zodiacal room . Each Zodiacal house g od rules over a month of the year, and the 7 planetar y gods regulated, according to Astrology, the affairs of mankin d by their relative positions in th e various rooms of th e Zodiac. Over them all ruled the Sun-go d (The All-Seeing Eye), who was considered th e central fire from which each had sprung. As you will recall, the learned docto rs of paganism believed th at all the other gods were but emanations of the one god, the Sun-god. Now 1, 6, 12, 36, 111, and 666 were the most sacred numbers in Astrology. Priests of Sun worship used the numbers mathematically by the way the stars travel acr oss the sky to predict future events. They invented ma gic charts to perform this mo st popular form of divination. Like the Roulette wheel, the charts were di vided into 36 numbered divisions. There were 6 columns in all directions with the numbers 1 to 36 placed inside the entire chart. Any direction you add the columns, they add to 111. There are six squares in each co lumn and 6 x 111 = 666. If you add all the numbers from 1 to 36 they will also add to 666. So you see, the numbe r 36 was a sacred number that identified with the 36 room gods of the Zodiac, and the numbe r"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"666 was a summary number of the Sun-god, because it was his sacred number as the Ruler o f the Zodiac. Most will agree that this is very interes ting, but there is still anot her, deeper deception the Apostle John, in the book of Reve lation, was told to warn the people of the world about. This is the number of the B east that will cause the world to worship Satan under a false system o f Christianity. \"Take heed lest any man deceive you. For many sh all come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.\" Mark 13:5,6. \"Here is wisdom. Let hi m that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred three-score and six.\" Revelation 13:18. The Hebrew-Chaldean, Latin, Greek and Ar ab languages have a numerical value for the letters of their alphabets. Take for instance the original Roma n Numerals. They were I V X L C D. And if you add these Roma n Numerals themselves, along wi th their numerical values we get:  I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 with a total of 666 The letter M was not in the original sy stem, it was added later. Now the pagans had a custom of adding their names acc ording to the value of their le tters of their own alphabet. As their languages are different, so were the values of each of their letters in their alphabets. The I in Roman Numerals equals 1; in the Gree k language, however, the I has a value of 10. The new Testament was originally written in the Greek language, and an ancient Gree k name for Satan in its tr ansliterations as we ex amined earlier was Teitan. And if you add Teitan in its Greek numerical valu es for the letters we get:  T=300 E=5 I=10 T=300 A=1 N=50 with a total of 666 Now since the Sun-god, the Heavenly Bu ll, brought both light an d darkness as he rose from east to west, he was wo rshipped also as both good and ev il. He was worshipped not only as a good and evil god, but bot h male and female. The reasoning behind this heathen p hilosophy is that the Sungod was believed to be the source of all thi ngs. So since there is good and evil, and male and fe male, the Sun-god had to be good and evil and double-sexed, b ecause men and women were cr eated in the image of their god. And since everything derive d from the Sun-god, the ancients believed that the soul of man was a divine spark that returne d to the central fire (the sun) from which they originally came . And since the pagans believe d the stars were but emanations of the sun, all the Star-gods were believed to be once men [36], that had visited this planet. This could explain why Quetzalcoatl, the Mexican and Azt ec messiah, was pictured in thei r arts as a good man who was a gr eat benefactor of ma nkind. He visited the earth to teach the arts of civilization, and promised his followers he would return, but he was pictured also as an evil serpent which devoured mankind. The American Indians, both in the North and in the South, consid ered the bird and the snake as sacred. The bird, because of its power of flight, contai ned the spirits of the dead, an d was associated with lightning. Both lightning and bi rds of prey can be seen to descend sharply from above and strike with lethal effectiveness [38]. Hence, the mythological time-cycle bird of fire was called the Phoenix not only by many Indian tribes of North America, but also by the Egyptians and the Phoenicians. Sometimes called Benu by the Egyptians, th e Phoenix was worshipped as th e bright and morning star. The morning star to the Egyp tians was the nocturnal repr esentation of the hidden Sungo d Osiris, or his soul. The Phoenix was known as \"The One Who Ferries Osiris\" [39]. In the earliest texts, the morning star and Orion, the ruler of the sky, are often compared. For some, gods with a similar name seem to be confused with the morn ing star, like Athtar, who was worshipped as the god of vegetation, as was Tammuz [40]. However, this name Athtar, according to Mythology of All Races, means Lucifer [41]. Now, it just so happens that one of th e old spellings of Phoenix is Phenex or Fenex in Greek transliterations. Like th e name Lucifer, Phoenix means \"Shining One\" [42]. And if we"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"add FENEX in its Greek value we get:  F=6 E=5 N=50 E=5 X=600 with a total of 666 It depended on what area of the world the pagan lived as to what type of bird was calle d the Phoenix. To the Egyptian, it was the heron. To the Babylonia ns, Assyrians, and Hindus it was peacock. To the North American Indian, it was the Eagle. To the Central and South American, he was the quetzal. In China, Japan and India the phoenix is th e peacock and the symbol of the sun. In Bali, the p eacock is a symbol of the enti re sky [43]. The pagan believed that when he died his spirit (soul) would become immortal a nd take possession of one of the stars in Heaven from whence he originally came [44]. It is significant that the Peacock Th rone made at Delhi, India, in 1628 is supported by 12 pillars, one for each of the 12 signs of th e Zodiac. It is eye opening to discover the Peacock Sun- b ird, a symbol of Lucifer, the god behind all false gods, pictured on a Roman Catholic Church window , encircled by the Zodiac. In the church of St. Maurice at Reims, France, we find a woma n (probably the Virgin Mary) pictured in a sun-halo an d crowned with seven stars. In one hand she holds a peacock, ar ound which stretches a circula r b and having on it the 12 signs of the Zodiac. Another shocking observation regarding the Roman Catholic Church is her exaltation of her Pope when in procession, as he is carried on his portable throne. During this procession, two gr ooms carry large fans of peacock feathers in such a way that the seated Pope seems to have two wings on hi s shoulders which are constantly in motion and they make him appear as if he is flying. In ancient Rome and Greece, heaven was c onsidered filled with eyes, the eyes representing the stars, the stars representing the homes of the dead. The god Argus was said to have hundreds of eyes [45]. These eyes of Heaven were represented by the eyes found on the p eacock feathers. June, Queen of Heaven to the Romans, ha d a peacock as her sacred bird [46]. The peacoc k or Phoenix has long been connect ed with the Zodiac. The Yezi dis, the open Devil worshippers we mentioned earlier, to this day have seven stone images of peacocks which they say represent the 7 planets and which they call Se itan, which is merely the Arabic spelling fo r Teitan or Satan. In Hinduism, the Ramayana relates that when the god I ndra transforms himself into an animal, he becomes a peacock. In India the peacock wa s believed to have a thousand eyes in its feathers and had power to ki ll snakes [47]. This sacred bi rd that symbolized the heavenly host is known to have been kept in Babylon for religious purpo ses. Aristotle mentions the p eacock bird, and a reference in a play by Aristophanes may imp ly that a Persian ambassado r b rought a gift of peacocks. Alexander the Great imposed heavy penalties on those who kille d Indian peacocks. The birds were depicted on Gr eek coins. They were sacred to Hera and a myth relates how the goddess set the hundred eyed Argus to guard her husband's mistress, Io, after Zeus sent Hermes to char m and kill Argus. Hera used the giant's ey es to ornament the p eacock's tail [48]. In Java, the peacock was associated with the Devil [49]. In Mosul in northern Iraq, there is a sect of Yezidis who hold that the Devi l is not evil, and call him the Peacock Angel. The worshi ppers of Satan could ha ve chosen no better an imal to represent the heavenly host as the proud ruler of the year, and god behind all gods. It is interesting to note that the very symbol of the proud ruler of the universe, according to heathen belief, is used as a symbol for the NBC Te levision Network! And CBS Television N etwork uses the \"All-Seeing Eye,\" which was th e symbol of the Sungod [50] the Ruler of the eyes (stars) in heaven. Also, AB C Television Network uses the Sun-disk as a symbol of thei r organization. It is very important that the reader have some knowledge of the various religions that derived out of Astrology so that he may understand the esot eric mysteries found in the goals and purposes of Secret Societie s. However, before we begin to study the Se cret Societies which we shall examine in the next chapter, there are a coupl e of more important facts about"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"astrology and spiritualism the reader should be aware of. Astrology teaches that this world is to pass through a time pe riod about 26,000 years. This is the length of time it takes, according to astr ology, for the Earth to pass through the influence of each of the twelve signs of the Zodiac. Each Great Mont h or Sign is figured about 2,100 years.\"' Hence, the entire time period of Tw elve Months having about 2,100 years each, is known to astrologers as The Great Year. This Great Year is divided by seve n ages: Leo, Cancer, Gemini, Taurus, Aries, Pi sces and Aquarius [52]. During this so-called Gr eat Year, or 26,000 years, astrology claims to have predicted the evolutionary progress of man from century to century. The starting point for the seven continual Ages began 10,000-8,000 BC, which was known as th e Age of Leo. From the boo k \"The Compleat Astrologer\", Park er, we read the following: \"The earliest Month of which we have real knowledge wa s that of Leo (10000 - 8000 B.C.): The Lascaux cave paintings show the Leonine creative influe nce but the thought-motivation behind the effort is Aquarian in spirit. The Age of Cancer (8000 - 6000 B.C.), witnessed the earliest development of set tled farming and constructed dw ellings - both of which are Capricornian in essence. During the Gemini an Age (6000 - 4000 B.C.) the founding of the earliest libraries comes under Sa gittarius. Perhaps the most stri king polarity of all was in the Taurean Age (4000 - 2000 B.C.), fo r the Egyptians were much pr eoccupied with death and the afterlife, themes strongly rela ted to Scorpio. The war-like Ar ian Age expressed its polarity with Libra in the magnificent beauty and ba lance of Greek Architect ure (2000B.C. - Birth o f Christ).\" (The Compleat Astrologer, Park er, McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1971, p. 44.) Now, according to Astr ology, we are living in the Age of Pisces (O - 2000 A.D.). The Age of Pisces is considered the Ch ristian dispensation. Pisces was sy mbolized in As trology in the form of a fish because the Mother goddess Venus and Cupid hur led themselves into the rive r Euphrates and became fishes after being terrif ied by the giant Typhon [53] . Hence, we find the real origin of the fish symbol that some erring Christians display to show they are Christians. Spiritualism te aches that during this e volutionary time ta ble of the 26,000 years, Masters o f Wisdom, or Christs, were to arise. Some were to be founders of great religions, say occultists, and they would have a variety of titles such as Mahatmas, th e Hierarchy, the Great Ones, the Secret Brotherhood, the Inner G overnment of the World, the Gr eat White Lodge of Masters o f the Wisdom. One of these socalled Masters was K oot Hoomi, who is said to have inspired a witch named Alice Bailey [54]. She clai med to be one of these Masters [55]. She was the author of many occult books, one of which was Discipleship in the New Age. In her book she states the following: \"We stand now on the verge of a similar but still more momentous event - the appearance o f the fifth kingdom, as a result of the planned activity of the New Group of World Servers, working in collaboration with the Hierarchy of perfected soul s, and under the guidance of the Christ Himself. This will us her in the New Age wherein fi ve kingdoms in nature will be recognized as existing side by si de upon earth.\" Discipleship in the New Age, Bailey, Lucis Publishing Co., 1944, p. 32. Bailey goes on to say th at this New Age we ar e entering into will cal l for a universal New World Religion [56]. This philosophy is based on the theory found in Astrology that this world is entering into the Age of Aquarius. Hence, the reader may look at this song foun d among Rock 'N Rollers in a different light. For \"This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius\" was written by disciples of this New Age Move ment to help promote the idea of a One Worl d Government and a One World Religion. Now, Aquarius is also known as the great coming New Month. In the book The Compleat Astrologer, Parker, p. 44, we read the following: \"In the Age of Aquarius, we may conjecture that man will consider a system of WORLD GOVERNMENT, which will involve the orga nizational characteristics of Leo.\""},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" Alice Bailey told her brethren that Ch rist Himself would usher in this New Age. Bailey goes on to say how this New Age will call fo r a New World Religion. In her book Disciples in the New Age, p. 38, we read the following: \"The Workers in the Field of Religion fo rm this group. Their work is to formulate the universal platform of the NEW WORLD RELIGION. It is a work of loving synthesis, and it will emphasize the unity and the fellowship of the spirit. This group is, in a pronounced sense, a channel for the second Ray of Love-Wisdom, that of the World Teacher - an office held at p resent by the Christ. The plat form of the NEW WORLD RELI GION will be built by the many groups working under the inspiration of the Christ and the influence of the second ray and these - in their totality - wi ll constitute this sixth group.\" Reader, be not deceived! The Christ here that Alice Baily is referring to is NOT JESUS OF NAZARETH! Spiritualism doe s not deny the existence of Je sus, but they do deny Jesus was God Manifested in the Flesh. And as we c ontinue to follow the history of the Great Luciferian Conspiracy, the read er will see how Spiritualism uses Christianity to destroy Christianity. We may examine this fact by reading the writings of another disciple of this New Age Movement who called himself Levi. In his book The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ, Levi shows how Spiritualism is trying to unite Christianity into its ranks which untol d millions have already been deceived by: \"The Christ is son, the only son begot ten by Almighty God, the GOD OF FORCE and Go d omniscient, God of thought; and Christ is G od, the God of Love. \" Levi goes on to say: \"Christ is the Logos of Infinities and through the word alone are thought and Force made manifest.\" (The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ, Levi, DeVorss & Co., Publishers, 1964.) Spiritualism teaches that Jesus was just one of the Master s that would come into the world. And the word Christ in Spiritua lism is a principle (Logos) and do es not refer to any particula r p erson [57]. Jesus was just another avat ar [58] among modern day occultists. Again, we quote from The Aquarian Gosp el of Jesus the Christ, by Levi, as follows: \"What relationship existed between Je sus of Nazareth and the Christ? Orthodox Christian ecclesiastics tell us that Jesus of Nazareth and the Christ were on e; that the true name of this remarkable person was Jesus Christ. They tell us that this man of Galilee was the very eternal God clothed in flesh of man that men might see his glory. Of cour se this doctrine is wholly at variance with the teachings of Jesus Himself and of His apostl es.\" (The Aquarian Gospel o f Jesus the Christ, Levi, De Vorss & Co., Pub., 1967, pp. 35, 67.) Contrary to what Levi said in his book, there are numerous Scriptures found in the Bible, b oth in the Old and New Testam ent that supports the doctrin e that Jesus was God Himsel f clothed in a human body. \"And wi thout controversy, great is the mystery of godliness: Go d was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit , seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.\" 1.Timothy 3:16. Jesus Himself said in John 14:8,9, \"Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, HAVE I BEEN SO LONG TIME WITH YOU AND YET HAST THOU NOT KNOWN ME, PHILIP? HE THAT HATH SEEN ME HATH SEEN THE FATHER; and how sayest thou then, shew us the Father?\" Here is another truth the Scriptures call to attention. \"Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.\" 1.John 2:22. \"An d every spirit that confesseth NOT that Jesus Christ is come IN THE FLESH IS NOT OF GOD: and this is that SPIRIT OF ANTICHRIST, whereof ye have heard that it should come; an d even now already is it in the world.\" 1.John 4:3. Spiritualism teaches that at the beginni ng of every Age there has been a Christ to ushe r them in. Jesus was the Christ who according to Astrology ushere d in the Age of Pisces (O - 2000 A.D.). Today, Spiritualism calls Christ \"The God of Force.\" Little do these modern Luciferians know that the Christ of the Holy Scriptures, the Lord of the Sabbath, foretol d through His Prophets how Spirit ualism would try to unite the world into a One Worl d"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Luciferian Socialistic Governme nt.

To trace the origin and purposes of Secret Soci eties, we need to go back again to the boo k of the beginnings (Genesis) to Adam and Eve's fall. The book of Genesis showed us how Satan caused a serpent to deceive Eve, then late r managed to get the very instrument used to deceive to be worshipped and ador ed. Now in this chapter we wi ll study the bait Satan used to actually induce the first humans to commit their deadly mistake, and how Lucifer has used this same bait to deceive others. What did the Father of Lies say unto Eve? \"For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, a nd ye shall be as gods , knowing good and evil.\" Genesis 3:5. Here is the Truth about how multitudes are swept into th e high ranks of Witchcraft to be used by Satan to deceive others. It was by cr eating a desire to obtai n forbidden knowledge that Adam and Eve were swept from the protection of God, and lost eternal life, not only for them b ut also their offsprin g. Satan implanted in Adam and Eve a desire to be like gods, knowing good and evil. This covetousness produced self-exaltation in th e minds of the earth's first couple, and it is this ve ry thing that led to Lucifer's own fall in Heaven. Man, from the time of Adam and Eve, has ever strive d to progress forward into the knowledge of the secret things of the Universe. As with Adam a nd Eve, Lucifer tries to kindle a desire to explore what God has not made known to us. The Bible reveals to man there are secrets of the Universe the Lord does not want to reveal to man. It is not because God is selfish, as the serpent implied, but because of the evil heart in man - he can't be trusted with them. Look at the condition that man has creat ed for himself in th e world today. He is constantly in fear, world wide, because of his evil inventions that could destroy the world. He is plagued day by day with the th reat of war, crime, and nationa l ruin within his own country. It was Christ who created the Un iverse and all that is in them . John 1:1-3, 14; Ephesians 3:9; Hebrews 1:1,2. Jesus is the owner, and it's His right to judge wh at knowledge man can o r cannot be trusted with. Saith th e Lord: \"The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us a nd to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.\" Deuteronomy 29:29. How were these secrets about the Earth' s history revealed? Saith the Lord: \"Surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto Hi s servants the prophets.\" Amos"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"3:7. For those things that were to be revealed to us, God chos e people that he knew he could trust and would faithfully carry out His pr escriptions. These people were called Prophets. They were to write down and record what wa s revealed to them by Visions and Dreams. Saith the Lord: \"And he said, hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a VISION and will speak unto him in a dream.\" N umbers 12:6. However, as there is a Mystery of Go dliness (1.Timothy 3:16) so is there a Mystery o f Iniquity (2.Thessalonians 2:7). And, as the Lord has His Prophets, so has the Devil. \"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transformi ng themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.\" 2.Corinthians 11:13-15. Now, one of the clear ways to test a prophet is found in Isaiah 8:20: \"To the Law and to the Testimony if they speak not acco rding to this word, it is because there is NO LIGHT IN THEM.\" If a man or woman cl aims to receive a vision or a dream from the Lord, but contradict the teaching in the Law (Torah) which means th e first five books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Nu mbers, Deuteronomy), or contra dicts the teachings found in the Testimony (the rest of the books of the Bible) , it is because the Lord has not sent them. Another way the Lord has give n His people to detect a true or false prophet is found in Deuteronomy 13:1-5: \"If there arise among you a prophet or a dr eamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods , which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the Lord you r God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shal l serve him, and cleave unto hi m. And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be pu t to death, because he hath s poken to turn you away from the Lord your God which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way whic h the Lord thy God commanded thee to to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee. \" As stated clearly above, the Lord said there are some people who can predict something to happen (give a sign), or can work wonders, but at the same time c ould be trying to lead us into the worship of one of these religions of Satan' s we have been examinin g. Can we not today, in our time, observe such things? Here is another way the Lord gives His people knowledge and understanding to see who is b eing led by the Holy Spirit, or being used by the Devil. \"I ha ve also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitu des, by the ministry of the prophets. And by a p rophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt , and by a prophet was he preserved.\" Hosea 12:10, 13. A true prophet's ministry will tend to preserve the people. When a man or woman claims to receiv e a message from the Lord about something to happen, but it doesn't, the Bible warns: \"But th e prophet, which shall pr esume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name o f other gods, even that prophet sha ll die. And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken? When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, i f the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it pres umptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.\" Deuteronomy 18:20-22. A genuine prophet of God is distinguished from a false prophet according to Scripture by his life, Doctrines, Pr edictions, and who he or she wors hips. If a prophet predicts certain events to happen and only some of the events come to pass, it is becaus e he is not receiving messages from the Lord. A genuine prophet of God, according to Scripture, is never wrong in"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"p redicting future events , because the messages he is rece iving are from the One who knows the end of things from the beginning. A prophet who foretold something to the Lord's people in ancient times, but that pred iction did not come to pass, was to be killed for deceiving the p eople. Now here is another important note from the Scriptures to rememb er in testing prophets: \"There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through fire or that useth divination, or an observe r of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits (s pirit guides), or a wizar d, or a necromancer. Fo r all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and because of thes e abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from thee.\" Deuteronomy 18:10-12. The God of the Bibl e says He communicates to Hi s Prophets through VISIONS AND DREAMS. He does not re veal messages through Astrologers, Palm Readers, or through cards, or by crystal ball visions. Th is is prophecy by divination. He does not reveal messages through a magician, sorcerer, or psychic. The Lord does not reveal messages through a hypnotist, called a charmer in Scripture. The Lord does not relay messages through spirit guides which the psychics, mediums and witches claim to be ancient sages or wise men. \"The dead know not any thing.\" E cclesiastes 9:5. The Lord does not communicate through wizards (male witches), or necromancer s, \"For all that do these th ings are an ABOMINATION UNTO THE LORD.\" Deuteronomy 18:12. As we tried to show you in the la st chapter, Astrology is the basic foundation o f Witchcraft. In Isaiah, th e Bible foretells what will happen to Astrologers and people who trust in them. Unlike Astrology, the Bible predictions have never fa iled: \"Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels, Let now the Astrologers, the Star gazers, the monthly Prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee, behold, they shall be as stubble: the fire shall burn th em: they shall not deliver themselves from the p ower of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at nor fire to sit before it.\" Isaiah 47:13,14. \"Remember the former th ings of old: for I am God, and there is none else , I am God, and there is none like me , declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, sa ying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure. \" Isaiah 46:9. Our Lord, from ancient times, has reve aled the mysteries of the Godhead and what he desires us to know about the Universe, and its future, through His Holy Prophets. However, instead of believing these words: \"Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; b elieve his prophets, so shall ye prosper,\" 2.Chronicles 20:20, Satan has led man away from the Gospel by keeping him interested in the secrets of the Universe . While abandoning the most ancient book we have about the world's hist ory the Bible, men are led to think there is Truth beyond Bible Truth and ha ve invented false sciences which totally contradict the Scriptures. The way out speculations and pure gue ss work used to support their findings leads them to eventually lose hold on what little faith they had in God, to even reject that there is a God. When the Jews were d eceived into worshipping the cosmic gods of nature and were sent into captivity by the Lord to Ba bylon as a punishment for their i dolatry, certain Jewish priests, while in Babylon, studied deep into the anci ent Babylonian mysterie s (Witchcraft). These p riests produced what became a philosophy calle d the Cabala, Cabbala, or Qabbalah (some o f the English spellings of a Hebrew word whos e more correct translit eration is Kabbalah), whose meaning is \"Receiving,\" or \"that which is received.\" The Cabala's central doctrine, say the Cabalists, deals with the unf olding of the hidden and unknowab le God into the fullness o f the manifest God, known by his work s [1]. In other words, they try to explain that which is hidden that the Lord has not reve aled. The scientific name for this science is Metaphysics. The word Cabala actually derived from the Hebrew verb, kabel which means to receive and"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"implies that the Cabala was rece ived, in the form of special re velations, by a few of the elect, who were especially chosen for the priv ilege, because of their saintliness [2]. This Jewish moveme nt didn't catch on among the Jews as a whole until about nine centuries after the resurrection of Christ. It reached its height in Spain when a Cabalist's Bible called the Zohar was published [3]. The Zohar was compiled by Moses de Leon at the end o f the 13th century. He incorporated into the Zohar, which means \"book of brightness,\" the doctrines of the infamous Gnostics and Neopl atonists [4] that the s oul is immortal and its attachment to the body is unfor tunate, but temporary. Cabalists believe in reincarnation and that God supplies all knowledge. They claim that the Scriptur es contain important symbols that, properly analyz ed, reveal secrets concerning the creat ion of the Universe. They believed that these secret combinations of words and symbols could be manipul ated to achieve magical results [5]. Unlike ancient Witchcra ft, the Cabalists believe that the Godhead consists of 10 emanations of the one God. However, these Jewish Cabalists do not believe that these emanations are gods, as paga nism teaches, but a complex organism consisting of ten emanations, potencies, or focal points, called the Sefiroth. These ten aspects, stages, o r manifestations of the Living Deity, the World of Emanation, or World of the Sefiroth, is not the Universe (stars), say Cabalists, but the Godhead in its existent aspect [6]. It is mind boggling to tr y to understand any of this nonsense; however we ask the reader to keep patience, for the reader must have a li ttle knowledge what the Cabala is so he can understand the philosophies behind the Secret Soci eties. It is from th e Cabala that modern Witchcraft and the Secret Societies say they draw many of their crafts. Like Witchcraft, the Caba la teaches that man is a microcosm (miniature universe), and has b oth male and female elements in the Godhea d. The female element of the Godhead is found in one of the ten emanations (Sefiroth). Th e Shekhinah, they say, is the female element b ecause it is the passi ve aspect to the Deity, the manife station of the di vine power which vitalizes all creation [7]. Cabalists say man has sp iritual intercourse with God th rough the Shekhinah. From Hasidic Prayer, by Louis Jacobs, page 61, we quote the following: \"But of Moses of the Zohar does say that he had intercourse with the SHEKHINAH! Tishby has, however, shown that there are, in fact, many passage s in the Zohar in which erotic symbolism is used for man's relationship with God and not only with regard to Moses.\" Jacobs goes on to say: \"For instance, the Zohar states that when a man cannot be with his wife, fo r example, when he is away from home, or when he is studying the Torah, or when she has he r p eriods, then the Shekhinah is with him so that he can be male and female.\" Another sacrilegious cl aim of the Cabala is also f ound in their philosophy about the 10 emanations (Sefiroth). Ca balists claim that the 10 Sefiroth is the Tree of Life from which the Universe emanated or came into existence, a nd that man can unite h imself with, or become, the One 'by rising through the sphe res,' spiritually climbing the ladd er of the Sefiroth to reach God [8]. In magic, the adept (a n expert) must experience and ma ster all 10 Sefiroth in order to achieve supreme perfection and power, for the Tr ee of the Sefiroth is believed to be a cosmic diagram, the basic pattern which shows how th e Universe is arrange d and how its phenomena are connected. And since man is a miniature repl ica of the Universe (m icrocosm) and of God, man is capable of spiritually expa nding himself to become God [9]. Is not this blasphem ous language nothing but an ec ho from Eden? \"YE SHALL BE AS GODS,\" Genesis 3:5. The Cabala teaches th at man can reach the magnitude of the Omnipotent God. Who would dare ma ke such a statement? As we saw earlier, his words are recorded in Isaiah 14:12-15. Like Roman Catholic Church doctrin es, there are enormous amounts of blasphemous claims against the God of Heav en that can be found in their literature. However, space does not allow us to venture too far into this dia bolical scheme to deceive. But to summarise what"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"b asically the Cabala is, it can be summed up in one word, MAGIC, a nd its roots are found in Babylon. Cabalistic magi c is mainly arranging numbers a nd combining Hebrew letters and their numerical values into magical squares and anagrams [10]. The Cabalists claimed Moses used magi c to bring the plagues against the Egyptians. However, it wasn't Moses who caused the pl agues to fall upon the Egyptians, it was God Himself. There will be more unveiling of the Cabala and how multitudes have been deceived b y it as we study into the doctrines and purposes of the Secret Societies. However, before we study the origin and purposes of the Secret Societies, we need to examine an ancient mystical name given to schools or groups that taught Babylonian mysticism. They were known fo r centuries as the Illuminati. And they called Babylonian mysticism ILLUMINISM. The Encyclopedia Americ ana, p. 698, says The Illuminati is a name taken, or given, to various groups of individuals existing during the past 2,000 year s, who believed in and taught a doctrine of illumination or i nner light (Illuminism) [11]. However, this mystical name derived from its orig inal source at a much earli er time. The Western equi valent to this Eastern mysticism is Hermeticism and Gnosticism, wh ich we will also examine as we go on. The Illuminati taught living a life of purity and servi ce would open their so-called inne r senses so that they would obt ain spiritual sight or Clairvoyance, known as the Third Eye, b ecome Seers, and be able to converse with ange ls and with dead sain ts [12]. The individual who became spiritually or intelle ctually enlightened in the an cient Babylonian Mysteries was initiated into the mysteries when quali fied, and called an Illuminated [13]. In France, under the name of Illumines, another Witchcra ft school appeared in Picardy in 1623, but only continued a short time because of the repressive measures taken by the Papacy. However, another sect of Illumines appeared in the south of Fr ance about 1722 AD and continued until 1794. They traced th eir origin to the Gnostics [16]. Here is an interesting note. It is from a sect of the Illuminati who existed in the 15th century that the Rosicrucians, an international Secret Societ y, claim their m odern fraternal order originated. They also continue to clai m that it actually deri ved out of the Egyptian mysteries before that time. Rosicrucism is a mixture of both Christianity and Witchcraft. The number 13 in Witchcra ft plays a very important part in the practice of Witchcraft as we saw earlier. And so it does in this frater nal Order of the Rosicrucians. Here from one o f their own publications, \"The Rosicrucian Cosm o - Conception,\" by Max Heindel, we read the following: \"The Order is not merely a secret society; it is one of THE MYSTERY SCHOOLS, and the Brothers are Hierophants of th e lesser Mysteries, Custodians of the Sacred Teachings and spiritual power more potent in the life of the Western Wo rld than any of the visible Governments, though they may not interfere with humanity so as to deprive them of their free will.\" Heindel goes on to say, \"Like all other Mystery Orders the Order of Rosicrucians IS FORMED ON COSMIC LINES: If we take balls of even size and try how many it will take to cove r one and hide it from view, we shall find it will require 12 to conceal a thir teenth ball. The ultimate division o f p hysical matter, the true atom, found in interplanetary space, is thus grouped in twelve around one. The twelve signs of the Z odiac enveloping our Solar System, the twelve semitones of the musical scale comprising the octave, the twelve Apostles who clustered around Christ, etc., are other examples of this grouping of 12 and 1. The Rosicruc ian Order is therefore also composed of 12 Brothers and a 13th.\" We will come back to the Rosicrucians in a moment, but let's go on and take another loo k at some other Mystic Schools w ho adopted this name \"Illumin ati.\" There were other little sects of Illuminism recorded in history like the Il luminati of Avignon and the Illuminati o f Stockholm; but none of them be came a threat to freedom, liberty of conscience, and Christianity like the Illuminati of Bavari a. This Secret Orde r was founded May 1, 1776, by"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"one Adam Weishaupt, a professo r of Canon Law at Ingolstadt, Germany, and an ex-Jesuit p riest.\" Weishaupt, and his Orde r of Illuminati, we shall study in the next chapter. Now, the Rosicrucians , who claim also to be illumi nated or Enlightened, say that Thutmose III of Egypt was the founder of their Secret Order. He erected two obelisks bearing a record of his achievements. One of these obe lisks is now located in Central Park in New York [18]. According to the Rosicrucians, after T hutmose III died, his son Amenhotep took up his father's work in their Brotherhood about th e end of September 1448 BC. He was succeeded by his son Thutmose IV, who ruled from 1420 to 1411 BC. Th en came Amenhotep IV, with whose history all the Ro sicrucians are greatly concerned. He was the Great Master in the family of the founders, and the one to whom th ey owe their philosophies and writings used so universally in all their Lodge work throughout the world. He was born in the Royal Palace at Thebes, according to the Rosi crucians, in 1378 BC [19]. To qualify to be initiated into the myst eries, the new initiate had to want to become an expert (adept) in Astrology, Ma gic, Sorcery, Fortune-telling, Ne cromancy, etc., which, by the way, is an abomination unto our Lord (Deuteronomy 18:10-12). On this side of the re surrection of Jesus Christ, there we re various other schools of these mystics besides the ones we already stated, who were given, or assumed, this name Illuminati, on the grounds of having superior knowledge of God, and of divine things which they claimed to be able to perform. The Ro sicrucians and the Illuminati's first cousins were the infamous Gnostics, from whom Simon Magus borrowe d his mysteries and mixed them with Christianity. Another group of Gnostics found in the book of Revelation were called the N icolaitanes (Revelation 2:15), w ho were followers of one Nico las, a deacon in the time o f Paul, who fell into licentious doctrines and practices [20]. Another such school for higher lear ning of Witchcraft wa s found in Spain around 1520 AD, and was called in the native language Los Alumbrados. It continue d for about a century, then disappeared as victim of the Spanish Inquisition. Ignati us Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits), almost became a vict im of the Spanish Inquisition himself when the Roman Catholic Church got wind of his connection with the Alumbrados. But he was acquitted before the Inquisition Court with an admonition [21]. However, there are some who hold today that the Illuminati is a front for the Roman Catholic Church to unite the world under her banner again. A nd, it was this same Ignatius Loyola who founded the Illuminati [22]. But, we will learn from history that it was not Ignatius Loyola who founded the Order of the Illuminati in Germany which has continued since 1776 AD. It was Adam Weishaupt, an ex-Jesuit. Now, coming back to the Rosicrucians who also used the name Illuminati for their Order: The reason the Rosicrucians look back to the re ign of Amenhotep IV wa s because he was the last of the Great Pharaohs of Egypt and Hermes Tr imegistus the Prophet, was born during his reign. There is much confusion in ancient and modern learned ci rcles about who Hermes actually was. Scholars of mythology said he wa s just a myth, as was Mercury, his equivalent to the Romans. His Egyptian equivalent, sa y some scholars, was the Egyptian god \"Thoth.\" The god Thoth or Hermes, was the moon god, who was the god of time a nd of its divisions. He was the measurer and the god of measuremen ts. He was also the conducter of the dead, and god of human Intelligence, to whom are at tributed all the productions of human Art. To the pagan Egyptians, all the literat ure of Egypt is attributed to Hermes. All the writings that relate to the different scien ces, mathematics, astronomy, medici ne, and music of the Egyptians were called by the Greeks \"The Hermetic Books.\" In Greek mythology, He rmes was known as the son of Zeus and Maia. He was the god who invented dice, music, geom etry, the interpretation of drea ms, measures and weights, the arts, letters, etc. He was also regarded as the patron of public treaties, as the guardian of roads and writing. Thoth to the Egyptians was cons idered a great king, a teacher of mankind, who"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"had left books of magic and myst ery behind him. Numerous books of such a sort once existed in Egypt. Clement of Alexandria claimed he knew of 42 so-called Herm etic fragments which could be found in the works of Stobaeus, Cyrillus, Suides and Lactantus. The Hermetic Books fa ll into two groups. The first d eals with Astrology, Alchemy, etc.; while the others are dialogues describing the soul 's regeneration in terms like the Cabala. This is the blasphemous doctrine that man can reach perfection thr ough his own efforts by j ourneying through the higher sphere s of knowledge, then after death, become God. Tradition says the Egyptian mysteries we re a key to a complete knowle dge of the Universe and man. And this so-called knowledge was preserved in these Hermetic Books which were believed for centuries to be wr itten by Hermes Trismegistus. Thes e books were universally accepted among the doctors of occultism as authentic books of Hermes until the early 17th century, when they were proven to be a fraud. They had actually been wr itten as late as the second and third centuries AD, by a succession of anonymous Greeks living in Egypt. However, even though these Hermetic B ooks were not directly from Hermes, as the occultists said, there are sti ll some interesting facts to le arn about who Hermes was, this legendary god of wisdom. To star t, we need to take a deeper look at the other gods of the Orient who were the Eastern equivalent to the Western go d Hermes. They were known in history as Nebo (Nabu) and Eel. Alexande r Hislop, who spent years tracing down ancient gods to Babylonian origin, has some very intere sting facts compiled fr om the ancient past in his book The Two Babylons. In this book Hislop states the following: \"If Ninus was Nimrod, who was the histor ical Eel? He must have been Cush; for Cush b eget Nimrod, Gen. 10:8, and Cush is generally represented as having been a ringleader in the great apostacy. But again, Cush, as the son of Ham was Hermes or Mercury; for Hermes is j ust an Egyptian synonym for the \"son of Ham.\" Now, Hermes was the great original prophet of idolatry; for he was recognized by the pagans as the author of their religious rites, and the interpreter of the gods.\" (The Two Babylons, Hislop, pp. 25, 26.) To the occultist, tradition says the Egyptian Mysteries were a key to a complete knowledge of the Universe and of man. But the truth is, Egypt received its knowledge of the ancient Mysteries from Ba bylonia. In the traditions of the ancient writers, Ninus is said to be the son of Eel who Gesenius the anci ent scribe identifies as N ebo, the Babylonian prophetic god. And Hyginus, another ancien t scribe, shows that Nebo was Mercury. And, Hyginus tell s how a similar legend was wr itten about the confusion o f tongues as stated in the Bible. Hyginus is quot ed by Hislop: \"For many ages men lived under the government of Jove (evidently not the Roman Jupiter, b ut Jehovah of the Hebrews), wi thout cities and without laws , and all speaking one language. But, after that Mercury interpreted the speech es of men (whence an interpreter is called Hermeneutes), the same individual distributed the nations, then discord began.\" (The Two Babylons, Hislop, p. 26.) Now the pagans ofte n named places, cities, and town s after their ch ief gods. A mount called Nebo east of Jordan ove r against Jericho, in Moab, part of the Abarim range, with a top called Pisgah, is where our Lord told Moses to view the land which he couldn't enter because of his transgression, Deuteronomy 32:49. Th e word \"Nebo\" means height [23]. The word \"Baal\" means Lord, but the na me \"Eel\" means \"The Confounder\" [24]. The ancients often got the two names Baal and Ee l mixed up as do modern scholars today. The Scriptures themselves show that Baal and Eel were two distinct gods with TWO distinct names. In Jeremiah 50:2; 51:44 we read: \"Declare ye among th e nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish and con ceal not; say, Babylon is taken, Eel is confounded, Merodach is b roken in pieces, her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.\" \"And I will p unish Eel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.\""},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" Now, Eel the Confounder or, in other words, the god of confusion, was himself to be confounded by the destruction of Babylon, the origin of all pagan religions. The name Babylon itself means \"Confusion\" [25]. Today, the city of Babylon is just as it was predicted to be, and now is a symbol of religious confusion throughout th e world which will, in these last closing days, unite under one banner. To the Romans the god Eel, who actua lly was Nimrod's father Cush, was worshipped as Janus, the two faced god, the god of gods. Hislop quotes Ovid, another ancient scribe who wrote of a hymn dedicated to Janus. \"From whom all the other gods had their origin is made to say of himself: 'the ancients... called me Chaos.'\" This god Chaos' name is used in our language t oday to mean confusion. The symbol of this god of confusion was a club, and Hislop goes on to say the following: \"..that symbol is a cl ub; and the name of a 'club in Chaldee comes from the very word which signifies 'to break in pie ces, or scatter abroad.' He who caused the confusion of tongues was he who 'broke' the previ ously united earth, Genesis 11:1, in pieces and scattered the fragments abroad. How significan t then as a symbol, is the club, as commemorating the wor k of Cush as Eel, the Confounder? That significa nce will be all the more apparent when the reader turns to the Hebrew of Genesis 11:9, and finds that th e very word from which a club derives its name is that whic h is employed when it is said , that in consequence of the confusion of tongues, the children of men were scattered abroad on the face of all the earth. The name of Cush is also 'Khus' for 'sh' fre quently passes in Chaldee into s; and Khus, in p ronunciation, legitimately becomes Khawos, or , without the digamma, Khaos.\" (The Two Babylons, Hislop, p. 27.) In Isaiah 46:1, it appears that Nebo and Eel are synonymous. \"Eel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth.\" And the symbol of this god (the club) is called the hammer in Scripture. \"How is the HAMMER of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! How is Babylon become a desolation among the nations.\" Jeremiah 50:23. Hence, it was Eel and Baal, or Cush and N imrod, who caused the inhabita nts of the earth to be s cattered all over the earth by introducing Astrology, Magic, Necromancy, etc., building an antichrist society that would change \"the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man and to b irds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things. Wherefor e God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dis honour their own bodies between themselves, Who changed the trut h of God into a lie, and wors hipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is bles sed forever. Amen.\" Romans 1:23, 24. Now look at the name \"Hermes,\" from whom these Secret Societies and occult fraternities say they draw their philosophies. The word Her, says Hislop, in Chal dee is synonymous with Ham, or Khem [26] the burnt one. This name formed a founda tion for covertly identifying Ham with the Sun, and so deif ying the Patriarch after whos e name the land of Egypt was called [27]. The Scriptures themselves state that Egypt was founded by Ham. \"Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the Land of Ham.\" Psalms 105:23, 27, Hislop goes on to say: \"Her is the name of Ho rus, who is identified with the Sun (Bunsen, Vol. I, p. 507), which shows the real etymology of the name to be from the verb to which I have traced it. Then, secondly, 'Mes' is from Mesheh for, without the last radical, which is omissible (see Parkhurst, Sub Voce, p. 416], Mesh, 'to dr aw forth.' \" The Two Babylons , Hislop, Loizeaux Brothers, p. 25. What all this means is \"Mes\" was used by the ancient Egyptians to show the genealogy o f the name applied. This will ex plain the Egyptian name s of Kings of Egypt such as Rameses, which means \"The Son of Ra,\" who was the Egyptian Sun-god, whose incarnation was \"Osiris.\" Hence, \"Hermes\" or \"Her-Mes\" means \"The Son of Her,\" or Ham, who was Cush [28]. \"And the sons of Ham: Cush, Mizrai m, and Phut, and Canaan.\" Genesis 10:6. Now it was really Cush who was wors hipped as Hermes, Eel, Nebo, Mercury, etc., that"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"was generally represented by th e ancients as their god who was the author of Astrology, Magic, Spiritualism, etc., on this side of the flood. Here are so me more astonishing facts about modern Secret Societies that even most of their own members are not aware of. Like the Rosicrucians, the Freemasons tr ace their origins to the Hermetic writings. And, ironically enough, the Freemasons admit that it was Nimrod al ong with Hermes (Cush), who founded their order. The following will be taken from an authorized publication o f Freemasonry called An Encyclope dia of Freemasonry and Its Kindred Sciences, by Albert G. Mackey 33\", p. 322: \"HERMES\" * IN ALL THE OLD M ANUSCRIPTS & RECORDS WHICH CONTAIN THE LEGEND OF THE CRAFT, MENTIONIS MADE OF HERMES AS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF MASONRY.\" Mackey goes on to say: \"He found one of the two pillars of stone, and found the science written therein, and he taught it to other men. There ar e two persons of the name of Hermes mentioned in sacred history. The first is the divine Hermes cal led by the Romans Merc ury. Among the Egyptians he was known as Thoth. Diodorus Siculus descri bes him as the secretary of Osiris; he is commonly supposed to have been the son of Mizaim, and Cumberland sa ys that he was the same as Osiris. There is, how ever, much confusion among th e mythologists concerning his attributes. \"The second was Hermes Tr ismegistus or Thrice Great, who was a celebrated Egyptian legislater, priest, and philosophe r, who lived in the reign of Ninus, about the year 2670 (BC). He is said to have written thirty six books on theology a nd philosophy, and six upon medicine, all of which are lost. There ar e many traditions of him; one of which, related by Eusebius, is that he introduced hieroglyphics into Egypt. This Hermes Trimegistur, although the reality o f his existence is doubtful, was cl aimed by the alchemists as the founder of their art, whence it is called the Hermetic science, AND WHENCE WE GET IN MASONRY, HERMETIC RITES AND HERMETIC DEGREES.\" Now in the same volumes of An Encyclope dia of Freemasonry and its Kindred Sciences, by Albert G. Mackey, Vol. 2, p. 518 we read who this other founder of Freemasonry was: \"NIMROD.\" THE LEGEND OF THE CRA FT IN THE OLD CO NSTITUTIONS REFE R TO NIMROD AS ONE OF TH E FOUNDERS OF MASONRY.\" It was indeed NIMROD who was first to teach the arts of masonry! Now here lies a key to understanding the mysterious rituals of Freem asonry. Just as the women who worshipped Thammuz were led to weep for the god because in the myth all the images wept for him, so does the Freemason mimic the myth s of the Sun-gods during their Hermetic Rituals. Just as the Roman Catholic is taught to mimic the death of Jesus Ch rist during Holy Week, so does Freemasonry imitate most of the myths of Baal worship. Here from their own publications we will learn the real purposes and goa ls of the leaders of Freemasonry. In the Booklet, \"The Masonic Report, \" published by C.F. McQuaig, a former 32nd Degree Mason, with an Introduction from James D. Shaw, a former 33rd Degree Mason and past Master of all Scottish Rite Bodies, we have now one of th e complete studies into the Secret behind Freemasonry. These form er high ranking Freemasons now EXPOSE Freemasonry fo r what it actually is, in hope th at deceived Masons will see who is really the hidden teacher o f their mysteries, and choose Jesus Christ as th eir Lord and Saviour, and will openly withdraw from it. Space won't allow us to examine the entire booklet ; however, we will examine Masonic books the booklet quotes , and also other Masonic books that we have ourselves. After the reader has examined these things from their own literature, the reader will learn that Freemasonry is nothing less than WITCHCRAFT! All this will be completely exposed in the p art 2 of this cha pter."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"1. A Comprehensive Study into the Secret Doctrines of Freemasonry. 2.

Freemasonry, says Albert Pike 339, is a continued effort to seek light. Albert Pike was a Confederate general during the Civil War who was honoured among Masons in the South as a great Confederate hero. He wa s honoured also among Masons as \"The Prince Adept, Mystic, Poet, and Scholar of Freemas onry.\" In the South he was al most considered a god-man, a genius, a hero among multitudes. Pike, also a well known American poe t, was born in Boston and studied at Harvard. From 1833 to 1836, Pike was the associat e editor, and then proprietor, of The Arkansas Advocate. His best known poems were \"T o the Mocking Bird,\" \"The Widowed Heart\" and \"Dixie.\" Little did the people of Arka nsas understand who they were naming their parks, st reets and a county after, when they used the name Albert Pike. And ironically enough, in Tennessee and Arkansas, a tourist will fi nd lakes and towns named afte r N imrod. Albert Pike made his mark before the war in Arkans as as a lawyer and writer, but as a Confederate Brigadier General, he was, according to the Ar kansas Democrat of July 31, 1978, a complete \"WASH-OUT,\" not a hero. Yet, Gen. Albert Pi ke is the only Confederate general with a statue on federal property in Washingt on, DC. He was honoured, not as a commander or even as a lawyer, but as Southe rn regional leader of the Scottish Rite o f Freemasonry. The statue stands on a pedestal near the foot of Capitol Hi ll. Albert Pike states in his book Morals and Dogma, which is a Bible of Freemasonry, that: \"Masonry is a search after Light. That search leads us dir ectly back, as you see, to the Kabalah. In that ancient and little understood medley of absurdity and philosophy, the Initiate will find the SOURCE OF DOCTRINES; AND MAY IN TIME COME TO UNDERSTAND THE HERMETIC PHILOSOPHERS, the Alchemist, all the Anti-Papal Thinkers of the Middle Ages and Emanuel Swedenborg.\" Morels and Dogma, Pike, p. 741 All a reader needs to do is glance at the pa ges of Masonic books and he will see this same p hilosophy taught from the Cabala we examined earlier. Here from Martin Wagner's boo k Interpretation of Freemasonry, p. 27, we read the following: \"The Temple is a glyph for the unive rse, the MACROCOSM, and for the MICROCOSM (THE INDIVIDUAL HUMAN TEMPL E), sometimes referring to the one and sometimes to the other. The details given in the ritual concerning Solomon's Temple, its artisans, apprentices, fellowcrafts, masters, pilasters, etc., are related to conceal the real Masonic meaning, or give an apparently rational expl anation to the ceremony. These things are the rubbish of the temple under which the REAL MASONRY IS CONCEALED.\" Quoted in Masonic Report, McQuaig, p.14 Masonry uses symbols of th e Bible to hide the real Mas onic meaning behind their Hermetic"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Rites. They just use the name Solomon for their Temples. The truth is, Solomon, the King o f Israel, was not a Mason, nor did he ever ha ve any connection with Freemasonry. The real reason Freemasonry uses the name Solomon is to hide the real NAMES OF THE SUN-GODS FROM THREE DIFFERENT NATIONS. Again, fr om An Interpretation of Freemasonry, by Martin Wagner, p. 97, we read the following: \"This name Solomon is not the Israelitish king. IT IS NAME IN FORM, BUT DIFFERENT IN ITS MEANING. IT IS A SUBSTITUTE WHICH IS EXTERNALLY LIKE THE ROYAL N AME. THIS NAME IS A COMPOSITE. SOL-OM-ON TH E NAMES OF THE SUN IN LATIN, INDIAN, AND EGYP TIAN, AND IS DESIGNED TO SHOW THE UNITY OF SEVERAL GOD-IDEAS IN THE ANCIENT RE LIGIONS, AS WELL AS WITH THOSE OF FREEMASONRY.\" Quoted from th e Masonic Report, McQuaig, p. 33. Freemasonry Lodge meetings at this present day are usually held in the upper chambers o f their lodges. The worshippers of Baal (the Su n-god) erected their idol s and altars on top o f hills, among sacred groves, or on the roofs of houses. Now in another authorized Masonic p ublication we read the following: \"Lodge meetings at present day are usuall y held in upper chambers , and the reason for this custom is that 'Before the er ection of temples the celestial bodies were worshipped on hills and the Terrestrial ones in va lley's.' \" General Ahimon Re lon, by Daniel Sickles, p. 75. Quoted in Masonic Report, Mcquaig, p. 15. Here again from an authorized Masonic publication, more shocking information about these Masonic Lodges, and the s ecret meaning of G.A.O.T.U., from The Master's Carpet, by Edmond Ronayne, past Grand Master of Lodge 639 in Chicago, on pages 301-302 we read the following: \"The Lodge room then is brought before us as a symbol of th e Universe, GOVERNED BY THE SUN-GOD, and its cubical form expressed in the language of the ritual is made to represent the united power of li ght and darkness, and the cons tant conflict which is supposed to be always going on between them. In other words THE LODGE ROOM IS THE REAL HEAVEN (IN MINIATURE), WHERE THE GOD OF NATURE THE G.A.O.T.U. - ALWAYS PRESIDES, WHERE HIS SYMBOL IS ALWAYS DISPLAYED, WHERE HIS WORSHIP IS ALWAYS PRACTICED, and wh en the good Mason dies he is simply transferred from this lower heaven of this L odge below, to the mount Olympus of the craft, called the Grand Lodge above.\" Quot ed from Masonic Report, McQuaig, p.15. Now here we see who this god of nature, the G.A.O.T.U., real ly is. It is the Sun-God! And j ust as the Witches hold their meetings at ni ght, so does the Freemason meet at night. Here from Symbolism of Freemasonry, by Albert G. Mackey 339 p. 157: \"Darkness, like death, is the symbol of initiation. It was for th is reason that all the ancient initiations were performed at night. The celebration of the my steries was always nocturnal. The same custom prevails in Freemasonry and the explanation is the same.\" Quoted from Masonic Report, Mcquaid, p.18. In the Hindu religion, the Sun-god, as in many others, was worshipped as we saw earlier as a Trinity. The Trinity was formed because of th e three phases of the sun's course. At sunrise the Hindu worshipped his Sun-god as Brahma, at noon he was Siva, and at sunset, he became Vishnu. Now, the high priests of Sun worship pretended to be the incarnation of the Sun-gods, and so do the Worshipful Master , the Senior Warden and the Ju nior Warden of these Masonic Lodges. Here from Freemasons Guide, by Daniel Sickles, on page 66 we read the following: \"The Worshipful Master represents the sun at its rising, the Senior Warden represents the Sun at its setting, and the Junior Warden represents the Sun at Meridian.\" Quoted from the Mosonic Report, McQuaig, p.18. In Baal worship, which is Witchcraft, it is taught that the god of nature, the Ruler of the Zodiac, the Sun, was both male and female. Now the three gods of the Trinity, or three great lights (sun, moon and stars) were symbolized as the geometric symbol which the Greeks"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"called the Delta, or the Triangle [1]. The Egyptian pyramids to th e Sun are solid figures on a tria ngular square with sloping sides meeting at an apex. The male and female elem ents of the Sun-god were symbolized, as we saw earlier, by two pyramids or triangles: The male symbolized as a triangle pointing upward, the female pointing downward. As we saw earlier, the pagans co mbined the two to form what is called the Hexagram. This is one of the most evil signs of Witc hcraft. It is us ed in magic to control spirits (demons). It is us ed by witches to cast a spell, to charm, or injure a person o r his property [2]. One of the most common uses for this symbol is the Star of David in the Jewish faith. This six pointed star commonly used by the deceive d Jews is called the Seal o f Solomon among Masons [3]. And the five pointed star called the Pentagra m, that witches get in the center to cast their sp ells, is also a Masonic symbol . They call the Pentagram the Blazing Star [4]. Now keeping in mind that Freemasonry is astr ological in all areas as this will help us see other deceptions as we go on. All Star worshi p, as originally taught by the Babylonians, says man's soul is immortal, and at death he had a place in Heaven among the stars. However, the chief gods of the Zodiac were the Seven Stars: 1. Sun 2. Moon 3. Venus 4. Mars 5. Jupiter 6. Mercury 7. Saturn The Morning Star, which is the East Star (the Phoenix, or Venus to the Romans), was the nocturnal representation of th e hidden Sun-god Osiris , or his soul according to Egyptian mythology. He was called \"Athta r,\" the East Star, among the Ar abs, which actually meant \"Lucifer,\" the Illuminated One. The Masons have adopted the name \"The Blazing Star\" to describe this symbol which the evil sign of Wi tchcraft (the Pentagram) derived with its two horns (points) attacking Heaven. Albert Pike says in his book Mo rals and Dogma, on pages 15 and 16: \"Our French Brethren place this letter Yod, in the centre of the Blazing Star . And in the old Lectures, our ancient English Bret hren said, 'The Blazing Star or glory in the centre refers us to that grand luminary, THE SUN, which enlightens the earth, and by its genial influence dispenses blessing to mankind.\" Pike goes on to say, \"They call it also in the same lectures , an EMBLEM OF PRUDENCE. The word Prudentia means, in its original and fullest signification, Foresight; and accordingly, the Blazing Star has b een regarded as an EMBLEM OF OMNISC IENCE, OR THE ALLS EEING EYE, which to the Egyptian Initiates was the EMBLEM OF OSIRIS THE CREA TOR. With the Yod in the centre, it has the kabalistic meaning of the Divine Energy, manifested as Light, creating the Universe.\" The pyramid with the ALLS EEING EYE as the cap stone, wh ich is a symbol of the EYE OF LUCIFER, can be found on the back of an American Federal Reserve Note for One Dollar. We will study how this satanic occult sign became an emblem of the United States monetary system in the next chapter. Very few Americans know that more than 50 of the signatories of the Declaration of independence were either Masons or Ro sicrucians, and were much into the esoteric (secret) sciences such as Astrology, Numerology, Tarot, Cabala, etc. Our own Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were both e xpert astrologers (occultists) [5]. As we saw earlier, the anci ents often used animals and birds to represent their chief deities in their myths. The \"Phoenix\" to the Egyptian was a species of the Heron family with long crest feathers. The name Phoenix to the Egyptia ns, as to other pagan nations was a name that symbolized the Sun-god under the names Ra and Osiris, and in later times was also thei r embodiment in the pl anet Venus, which is the Morning Star , or East Star. The name Phoenix, as we pointed out earlier, means \"Shining On e\" [6] and so does the name \"Lucifer\" [7]. However, it was the Eagle (Sumerian symbol ) which took flight daily across the vault o f Heaven and traversed the celest ial dominion of the stars and constellations, descending toward the Rising Sun from the storm cl ouds of Adad. The Eagle was a symbol of the Sun-god as the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Spring and Morning Sun, victorious over the powers of Darkness and the Underworld through which he passed nightly [8]. As several times throughout this book, we have tried to show that it is Satan (Lucifer) who is being worshipped through a camouflage of pa gan gods symbolized as humans, animals o r birds. It was Lucifer who was the orig inal \"Light Bearer\" (Isaiah 14:12). Now this sacred bird of light, the Phoe nix, who was also symbol ized as a peacock and heron, is also worshipped today among the Ameri can Indians as the Eagle. Very few Masons, like the Roman Catholics, unders tand the religion they blindly se rve. They're told to do things they don't understand and they do them without questioning why. And so is it among the Protestant circles. They never think to check the words their Pa stors have told them with the Holy Scriptures themselves, as the Bible clearly states: \"Prove all things: hold fast that which is good.\" 1.Thessa lonians 5:21. Very few Masons know that Albert Pike, this highest au thority of Freem asonry, The Prince Adept, Mystic, Poet, and Scholar of Freemasonry, was himself also the head of the Palladist, another Secret Society which openly wors hipped Lucifer and was bent on destroying Christianity, replacing it with th e worship of Lucifer himself. Albert Pike, the head of the Freemasons, was also an Apostl e of Lucifer! Here from th e Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Vol. 12, p. 204, we read the following: \"The latter group, with which we are ma inly concerned, was known under the alternative names of LUCIFERIANS and PALLADISTS. They were said to adore LUCIFER, the equal and foe of ADONAI, Jahweh. He was in their view the G od of Light, the good principle, while Adonai was THE GOD OF DARKNESS, THE EVIL PRIN CIPLE. In sort, he was Satan himself. This worship was founded on a dualistic philosophy and was a sort of topsy- turvy Christianity. The name of Palladists is derived from a pa lladium which they were said to revere, namely the BAPHOMET or grotesque i dol, the worship of which was one of the articles of accusations agains t the \"Knights Templars\" in the 14th century. It was alleged that the Baphomet was preserved in secret through ne arly five centuries after the suppression o f the order and ultimately carried by one Isaac Long in 1801, togeth er with the sk ull of the last Grand Master, the unhappy Jacques du Molay, from Paris to Charleston in the United States of America. These relies were averred to have there become the sacred objects of a society which was a development of Freemasonry. \"The head of the society, we are tol d, was one ALBERT PIKE, under whose influence it spread all over the civilized world.\" After Albert Pike's death, Adriand Lemmi transfer red this Luciferian Secret Society from Charleston to Rome. And it was reported that the most foul, cruel an d obscene rites, along with the adjuration of Christ and his reli gion, accompanied by the ap pearance of Satan himself, were all part of the ceremonies that took place during their meetings. See Encyclopedia of Religion a nd Ethics, Vol. 12, p. 204. From the beginning of this book, we have to s how the reader that ther e is a spiritual conflict b etween God and Lucifer, and Christians and Luciferans. We have tried to show through history how Satan has indeed been working little by little to condition the world into worshipping him through various ca mouflages. Just like Luci fer tried to overthrow the worship of Adonai (Jehovah) in Heaven, so do es Lucifer have him a Worldwide Conspiracy working today, behind the public eye, that is bent on destroying the Christian religion, and establishing a Luciferian Govern ment on this earth, lust as Ch rist commissions His people to go and preach the Gospel to every kindred, tongue and nation, so doe s Lucifer have his apostles who are as determined to promote their god through \"s piritual wickedness in high p laces.\" Ephesians 6:12. Just as our Lord gives His pe ople the \"Spirit o f Prophecy\" (Revelation 19:10), so does Luci fer give his people the \"Spirit o f Divination\" (Acts 16 :16). This gospel of Lucifer is IIluminism, and is the foundation of the various Secret Societies."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" If the reader has any doubt s about Albert Pike's involvement in the Luciferian Conspiracy, let his own words in his own book, Morals a nd Dogma, help convince you. Here from page 787 is how Pike slowly instru cts unsuspecting Masons about the importance of the Eagle, which is another emblem of Freemasonry, and from ancient times a symbol of Lucifer. \"A great Black Eagle, King of Birds. He al one it is that can fire the Sun, material in its nature, that has no form, and yet by its form develops color. The black is a complete harbinge r of the work: it changes color and assumes a natu ral form, out whereof w ill emerge a brilliant Sun.\" On page 102 of Morals and Dogma, Pike said the following: \"The true name of Sata n, the Kabalists say, is that of Yahveh (God) reversed; for Satan is not a black god, but the negati on of God. The Devil is the personification of Atheism o r Idolatry. For the Initiates, this is not a PERSON BUT A FORCE, CREATED FOR GOOD, BUT WHICH MAY SEAVE FOR EVIL, IT IS THE INSTRUMENT OF LIBERTY O R FREE WILL. They represent th is Force, which presides over the physical generation, unde r the MYTHOLOGIC and HORNED FORM OF THE GOD PAN; THENCE CAME THE HE- GOAT OF THE SABBAT BROTHER OF THE ANCIENT SERPENT, AND THE LIGHTBEARER OR PHOSPH OR, OF WHICH THE POET S HAVE MADE THE FALSE LUCIFER OF THE LEGEND.\" Now, on page 321 of Morals and Dogma, Pike says the following: \"Lucifer, THE LIGHT-BEARER! STRA NGE AND MYSTERIOUS NAME TO GIVE TO THE SPIRIT OF DARKNESS! LUCIFER, THE SON OF THE MORNING! IT IS HE WHO BEARS THE LIGHT AND WITH IT SPL ENDORS INTOLERAB LE BLINDS FEEBLE, SENSUAL, OR SELFISH SOULS? DOUBT IT NOT!\" Just as the Word of God is a Light that shines through the dar kness (ignorance) of this world, so is there a counterfeit Light called Il luminism that actually derived from the name Lucifer. For \"Lucifer,\" as we have already seen, means \"The Illuminated One,\" or \"Shining One.\" Speaking about this counter feit Light (Illuminism), Gerald B. Winrod, D.D. states in his booklet, Communism In Pro phecy History America, p. 37: \"As divine illumination is experience in the soul of the be liever through contact with the Holy Spirit, so also there is a counterfeit light that poisons human thought and produces decay. There are 'seducing spirits' that impregnate human minds with 'doctrines of devils.' \"There is a white light of spiritual illumination. But there is also a black light of demonic illumination. Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.... Illumini sm is black magic. Jannes and Jambres manipulated these powers in the days of Moses. The attack is as old as sin on the planet.\" Luciferians teach, it is Chri st who is the imposter and the Evil One, while it's Lucifer who is the Good God. Like modern Witchc raft, Luciferians do not believ e that Satan exists. They do not believe Satan and Lucifer are the same god. Another Apostle of Lucifer, like Albert Pike, who was equal in the knowledge of the Hermetic Sciences (Witchcraft) was one Alei ster Crowley. We will examine more shocking facts about Albert Pike late r on. Aleister Crow ley (1875-1947) wrote ma ny books on magic. He was violently against God and Christiani ty, and saw himself as a Messiah of a new religion. He was a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn headed at that time by a Samuel Liddell Mathers, who later expelled Crowley from thei r Secret Society. This Secret Society, which exists today, taught the use of magical weapons and practiced ceremonial magic mixed with drugs and sex. As a child, Crowley was brought up in a Christian environm ent where he l earned of the warning about the Beast of Revelation, and its number of doom, 666. However, this warning took just an opposite effect on hi m. Because of his terrible be haviour as a child, his mothe r said to Crowley that he remi nded her of the Beast of the book of Revelation that came out o f the depths of the sea, with horns on his head, blaspheming God. Later as Crowley developed a deep seated hatred for Jesus Christ, he be came ever more zealous in trying to destroy"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Christianity. To show his reje ction of God and the Bible, not understanding what the beast symbolized in the Bible, his ignorance led him to proclaim that he was the Beast 666, and finally found a name that he could use that would add to that numbe r 666. The name he used was \"THE WILD BEAST,\" which in Greek, \"TO META OHPION,\" adds to 666 [9]. Like Ahab and Jezebel in th e Bible, he made an all out effort to pr omote the Mysteries o f Sun worship. He held accordi ng to Crowley, meetings with what he called a Secret Chie f (familiar spirit) called AIWAZ. This Aiwaz helped in writ ing one of his books called The Book of the Law [10], where Crowley summed up his magical philosophy with his motto: \"DO WHAT THOU WILL SHALL BE THE WHOLE LAW\" [11]. In Crowley's book, Magick in Theory and Practice, he states the following: \"The Devil is, historicall y, the God of any people that one personally dislikes. This has led to so much confusion of thought that The Beast 666 has preferre d to let names stand as they are, and to proclaim simply that Aiwaz -- the solar-phallic hermetic \"LUCIFER\" is His own Holy GUARDIAN ANGEL, AND \"THE DEVIL\" SATAN OR HADIT OR OU R PARTICULAR UNIT OF THE STARRY UNIV ERSE. THIS SERPENT SATAN, IS NOT THE ENEMY OF MAN, BUT WHO MADE THE GODS OF OUR RACE, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL; HE BADE \"KNOW THYSELF !\" and taught Initiation. He is \"THE DEVIL\" OF THE BOOK OF THOTH, AN D HIS EMBLEM IS \"BAPHOMET;\" the Androgyne who is the hieroglyph of arcane perfection.\" Crowley goes on to say, \"... But moreover his letter is Ayin, THE EYE; he is Li ght, and his ZODI ACAL IMAGE IS CAPRICORNUS, THAT LEAPING GOAT WHOSE ATTRIBUTE IS LIBERTY.\" Now, it was this same Aleister Crowley w ho helped establish an Or der of Rosicrucians in San Jose, California. And Crowley is numbere d among other magicians and sorcerers such as Emanuel Swedenborg, Sir Richard Kelly, Eliphas Levi, Alice Bail ey, and that pot-smoking medium named Madame Blavatsky (founder of the Theosophical Society which we will study in a moment) as one of the lead ers of modern Spir itualism today. Because the books Aleister Crowley wrote were e xposing the secrets of the occult, in 1912 Crowley received an unexpected vi sit at his flat in Victoria Street, London, from one Theoda r Reuss, a high ranking German Freemason, and also an agent of the German Secret Police. Reuss had come over from Ge rmany for the express purpose of meeting Crowley and accusing him of giving away ma gical secrets [12]. Among the o ccultists, giving away secrets is a crime punishable by death, as it is in Freemasonry. And sinc e there is very little difference between any of these Secret Societies, this vow of secrecy applies to all occultists. Now this Theodar Reuss was not only a high ranking German Freemason, but belonged to another Secret Society called ORDO TEMPLI ORIENTIS, or Order of the Templars of the East, that the infamous pot-s moking Madame Blavatsky and Ka rl Relier an associate o f Blavatsky, founded in 1902 [13]. Now, special attention should be given to th is \"Ordo Templi Orientis ,\" for it centers around much of the Antichrist movement among our young people today! The Ordo Templi Orientis claimed that it could communicat e in nine Degrees the secret s not only of Freemasonry, but o f the Rosicrucians, The Illuminati, the Order of th e Holy Grail, the Knights of the Holy Ghost, and the Holy Sepulchre [14]. Bl avatsky and her associates clai med they were the key which opens up all Masonic and Hermetic secret s, namely, the teaching of sexual magic (Phallicism), and this doctrine of sexual ma gic would explain, wit hout exception, all the secrets of Nature, all the symbolism of Free masonry, and all systems of religion [15]. So, since Crowley was very learned in these areas and was revealing these things to the ordinary reader in his books, Reuss was sent to tell Crowley: \"Since you know our hidden sex teachings, you'd better come into our Order.\" Crowley agreed, a nd after a journey to Berlin, he was transformed with due ceremony into the Supreme and Holy King of Ireland, Iona, and all them Britons that are in the Sanctuary of the Gnosis. And he ga ve himself the magical"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"name of BAPHOMET [16], which we saw is just another name for Lucifer. Now, this Order of the Te mplars of the East, or Ordo Temp li Orientis, in the 1960's had a Lodge operating under the name of \"The Process Church of the Final Judgment\" in Los Angeles [17]. This same \"Process Church of th e Final judgment\" attrac ted a male Witch that had studied deep into magi c, warlockery, hypnotism, astr al projection, Masonic lore, scientology, ego games, subliminal motivati on, music, and whose religion was like the Yezidis, Gnostics, and the Pall adists, of whom Albert Pike was once a leader, as we studied earlier, and which was a mixtur e of both Satanism and some elements of the Bible. This religious leader and revolutiona ry claimed he was both Satan and Christ [18]. His name is Charles Manson. Ironically enoug h, Manson studied Witchcraft while he was in prison at McNeil Island Penitentia ry in Washington [19]. On March 21, 1967, Manson left prison. He was thir ty-two years old. At first he went to the Bay area and hung around the Berk eley and the Haight-Ashbury district, wher e he met his first disciples (Mary Brunner and Lynn \"Squ eaky\" Fromme). He was introduced to LSD, experienced an hallucination, and thought he was Christ . When the leader of the \"Family\" was arrested, he was booked as \"Manson, Char les M. aka Jesus Christ, God\" [20]. Before the slayings that were to become known as the Tate-LaBianca murders, Manson and his Family moved to Santa Barbara and T opanga Canyon, where they supported themselves by theft (especially of credit cards) and drug dealing.\" Vincent Bugliosi, the prosecutor during the Ta te-LaBianca trials, in his search for a motive for the barbaric slayings, found that the moti ve was centered around a bizarre religious belie f and rock music. Also centered around the in famous Charles Manson Family were found very well-known names in Hollywood and rock music circles. In his book, Helter Skelter, Bugliosi said Manson had an obsession for the Beatles' music, according to former inmates. Wh ile he was in prison , the Beatles song, \"I Want To Hold You r Hand\" became the No.1 song on the record charts in lanuary 1964. Manson's fanatical interests while in prison were sc ientology, his guitar, and his inte rest in the Beatles songs. But he told numerous people that, given the chance, he could be much bigger than the Beatles [22]. Manson believed that the Be atles were modern da y prophets that were giving their messages through their music. Manson woul d quote, verbatim, lyrics fr om the Beatles songs, finding in them a multitude of hidden me anings. He would also use hi s interpretation of Revelation chapter 9 to support his own views [23]. Now he re lies the bizarre reasoning behind the mass murders he and his Family committed. We are not interested in studying the bloody history o f the actual killings, but how these young human beings could be led to do such things. First of all, the reader mu st remember that the basic foundati on to all Witchcraft is the belie f that man will continue to live af ter death (immortality of the s oul). That man is, as it were, stuck in a body, but it is only temporary, because he has a soul that will live in Paradise at death. This first lie, \"Ye shall not surely die,\" as we studied earlier, is not a new doctrine, but is as old as this first lie. To help a Bibl e believer understand why the chapter 9 in the book o f Revelation was more viewed th an the 13th, 14th, 16th, 17th or 28th chapters by the Manson Family we have to know the significance be hind the occultist doctrine of the number 9. In ancient pagan numerology, the number 9 is the number of the circ le, which was a symbol of infinity or immortality. Take the zodiac, for instance. As we saw earlier, it was a 360° circle. Now the numbers 36 and 360, both importa nt to astrologers, would add to 9 if thei r components were separated and added: 3+6=9 3+6+0=9. Much medieval magic revolves around the number 9. It was considered one of the most potent of numbers because it was composed of the all powerful 3 that represente d the Trinity: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. The number nine was sacred to the pagan goddess [24] of deat h, the underworld and He ll, the burning place o f torment. Witches believed that they c ould be reincarnated nine times [25]. Charles Manson believed and taught that death was only a cha nge. \"The soul or spirit can't"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"die,\" he said. Death was \"a fear that was born in man's head and can be taken out of man's head, and then it would no longer exist\" [26]. Ancient pagans believed th at death was a blessing, for at death they would shed this mortal b ody and become a ghost. It was recorded that th e Aztec Indians in Central Mexico sacrificed 20 thousand human beings a year without the sl ightest guilt of conscience. Even the victims themselves would line up with little resistance to be sacrif iced to the Sungod. Some believed it was a high calling to die for the Sun-god becaus e in their myth, the Sun and the Stars kille d each other at night. Huitzilopochtli (the Aztec Sun-god) was rebor n every morning. The bloody sacrifices of the Aztecs were believed necessary because the Sun-god was nourishe d b y human blood. Most of the wars carried out ag ainst their neighboring tribes were to get unwilling victims to sacrifice. Charles Manson taught his di sciples that they were living in the Age of the Armageddon and the word he used for this Great Battle was \"H elter Skelter.\" He taught his foll owers that the b attle of Armageddon would be fought by a race war between the blacks and whites. There are two keys to understanding this ignorant man's murderous propaganda, and his false interpretation of the book of Revelation. One, th e number 9 in Witchcraft, as we have seen, identified with death, Hell (fire and brimstone ), and also the immortal soul. Hence, Manson's whole religion was based on hi s interpretation of Revelation chapter 9. The second key to understanding the Manson madness was the revolutionary propaga nda from the Beatles songs. John Lennon of the Beatles can be quoted as saying, \"Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that: I'm right, and I will be proved right. We're (the Beatles) more popular than Jesus now...\" St. Louis Globe Democrat, Aug. 5, 1966, quoted from The Death of a Nation, Stormer, Li berty Bell Press, 1968, p. 67. What came to pass about the Beatles and John Lennon's tragic deat h is public record but Christianity is still here, a nd will continue until Christ's Second Coming. Saith the Lord: \"These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord o f lords, and King of kings: and th ey that are with him are call ed, and chosen, and faithful.\" Revelation 17:14. A decade after the Tate-LaBianca murders, it was reported that ev il propaganda messages were found in some Beatles songs. This article appeared in the Sa n Antonio Light, Monday, February 1, 1982. The headline read: \"Backward masked Satan promos found on some Rock'n Roll Records.\" Evil messages we re not only found in the Beatles' music, but also in other roc k groups, such as Led Zeppelin, Queen, Black Oak Arka nsas, and the Electric Light Orchestra. This subliminal technique of hiding sata nic messages is known as \"Backward Masking.\" Messages that cannot be heard when played forward are implante d in the songs. This b ackward masking of messages can only be unders tood when the record is played backwards. This is done by placing the speed of the turntabl e in neutral position, then spinning it by finge r b ackwards at a speed where the voice of the group is distinguishable. The Led Zeppelin song, \"Stairway to Heaven,\" played backwards can be heard to say: \"MY SWEET SATAN.... THE ONE WILL BE SAD WHO MAKES ME SAD, WHOSE POWER IS SATAN.\" Forward the lyrics say, \"YES, THERE ARE TWO PATH S YOU CAN GO BY; BUT IN THE LONG RUN THERE'S STILL TIME TO CH ANGE THE ROAD YOU'RE ON.\" The Black Oak Arkansas song, \"The Day El ectricity Came to Arkansas,\" contains the b ackward message, \"SATAN, SATAN, SATAN, HE IS GOD.\" Alt hough the Beatles songs do not mention the name Satan in their White Al bum, still it is the Be atles song, \"Revolution N o. 9,\" with which Manson was ob sessed. Charles Manson, a satani st himself, believed that the Beatles, as modern day prophets, were te lling Manson through their songs what he was to do and what was going to cause the Battle of Armageddon [28]. Manson's disciples also b elieved that the Beatles songs were speaking to Charles Manson, especially the songs in thei r so-called Whit e Album. For instance, in th e song \"I Will,\" can be h eard: \"And when at last I find you / Your song will fill th e air / Sing it loud so I can h ear you / Make it easy to be nea r"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"you.\" Manson interpreted this to mean the Be atles wanted him to make an album too. He firmly believed that he was Christ and the Beatles were looking for him. Manson told his followers that the Beatles knew th at Christ had returned to earth again and that he was living somewhere in Los Angeles [29]. Here is conf usion. John Lennon, as we saw, was antiChrist. In the Beatles' White Album is a song cal led \"Honey Pie,\" which ca n be heard: \"Oh honey p ie, my position is tragic / Co me and show me the magic / Of your Hollywood song.\" The song goes on to say: \"Oh Honey Pie you are driving me frantic / Sail across the Atlantic / To b e where you belong.\" In January and February of 1969 just after the White Album was released, Manson and his disciples tried to contact the Beatles through several telegrams, letters, and through telephone calls to England, to invite the B eatles to cross over the Atlantic and join him in Death Va lley. However, they were without success [30]. Manson told his follower s that in the Beatles White Al bum were found the messages that would \"set up things for the revolution\" he believed was th e Battle of Armageddon. There were actually five songs that Manson and his disciples took, more than the others found on the album, that they believed were messages directed to him. They were: \"Blackbird,\" \"Piggies,\" \"Revolution 1,\" \"Revolution 9\" and \"Helter Skelter\" [31]. In the song, \"Blackbird singing in the dead of night / Take thes e broken wings and learn to fly / AIl your life / You were only waiting for this moment to arise.\" Manson inte rpreted this to mean that the black man was going to arise, overthrow the white man, and take his turn. And the Beatles, according to Manson, were trying to cause them to star t a race war. We will come back to this revolutionary propaganda in a moment. To understand this satanic delusion, we need to see how Manson butchered the Holy Scriptures to support his prophecy of Helt er Skelter (Armageddon) . In Revelation 9:1, we read: \"And the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.\" Now Manson 's interpretation of the bottomless pit is a cave underneath Death Valley, where his chosen people (the Family) would go during the N egro Revolt (Helter Skelter), th at he said the Hopi Indians knew about [32]. Manson said his Family were the original Christians reincarna ted, and that the Romans had returned as the Establishment. Hence, Manson a nd his chosen people would rema in in this secret paradise underneath Death Valley until his chosen people grew to the number 144,000. Manson told his disciples that the bottomless pit has a golden city with a river of mi lk and honey that runs through it, and a tree that bear s twelve kinds of fruit, a diff erent fruit each month. You don't need to bring candles, nor any flashlights, down there because the wa lls will glow, and it wouldn't be cold or be too hot . And there would be warm spri ngs and fresh water, and people would already be down ther e waiting for him [33]. The first four angels of Revelation, chapters 8 and 9, Mans on interpreted to be the fou r Beatles and the Locusts (insects) were describi ng the Beatles also because \"They had hair as the hair of women\" Revelation 9:8. Out of th e mouths of the Four Angels (Beatles) \"issued fire and brimstone.\" In Revelation 9:17, th e fire and brimstone CAME OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF THE HORSES, NO T THE FOUR ANGELS as Ma nson mis-interpreted. This fire and brimstone represented the lyrics, accord ing to Manson, the power of the songs of the Beatles [34]. Their \"breastplates of fire\" were the electric guitars. Their shapes \"like unto horses prepared unto battle\" were their dune buggies. The Horsemen who numbered two hundred thousand thousand and who would roam th e earth spreading destruction, were the motorcycle gangs. And the Fifth Angel, according to Manson, was himself [35]. Now in Revelation 9:4 it ta lks about \"the SEAL OF GOD in their foreheads.\" Manson was asked what this meant and he sa id that this meant there would be a MARK on people that only he would be able to see, a nd the MARK would designate wh ether they were with him o r against him [36]. And in Revelation 9:11 we read: \"And they had a ki ng over them, which is the angel of the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"b ottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name APOLLYON. \" Abaddon means \"destroyer.\" Manson, who believed he was both Christ and Satan incarnated, believed that th is applied to him, for according to Manson, he was \"the king, which is the a ngel of the bottomless pit.\" The Beatles song \"Revolut ion 9\" contains a segment that , played backward, has anothe r message. The repetition of \"num ber nine, number nine\" in re verse says, \"Turn me on dead man.\" \"Revolution 1,\" as give n on the jacket insert, reads: \"You say you want a revolution / Well you know / We all want to change the wo rld... / But when you talk about destruction / Don't you know that you can count me out.\" However, wh en you listen to the record itself, immediately after \"OUT\" you hear the word \"IN\" and Manson took this to mean the Beatles once undecided, now favored the Revolution. Now later on in the song, the lyrics say, \"You say you got a real solu tion / Well you know / We'd all love to see the plan.\" To Manson, the meaning of this lyric was obvi ous: Manson was to sing out and tell the TUNE-IN people how to escape the Armageddon (Helter Skelter) [37]. In \"Revolution 9,\" the listener hears whis pers, shouts, snatches of dialogue from the BBC, b its of classical music, mortar s exploding, babies crying, church hymns, car horns and football yells-which, together with a ch ant of \"Number 9, Number 9, Number 9,\" build to a climax o f machinegun fire and screams, followed by the soft and obviously symb olic lullaby of \"Good N ight\" [38]. Manson said this was th e Beatles' way of prophesying the battle of Armageddon, which Manson believes is a race war. In the back ground of all this noise on Revolution 9, Manson heard the oinking of pigs and a man's voice saying, \"Rise.\" This to Manson was the Beatles' way of telling the black man that now wa s the time to RISE an d start the Armageddon. Manson told his followers that the race war would start by Blacks going to the rich piggy districts and murdering them, cutting bodies up, smearing blood, and writing things on the wall in blood. These superatrocious crimes woul d cause the white man to start the war. The statement Manson made signed hi s own guilt decree. On the walls of the places where the murder victims were found, writ ten in blood were the word s, DEATH TO THE PIGS, RISE and HELTER SKELTER [38]. The whole plan of this re volution and terrorism was to inci te the white man into starting another civil war. The que stion is, was all this an isolated plan of one crazed lunatic, or was Manson himself just a pawn in a much larger ci rcle of hidden instigat ors that want to provoke revolution, riots, race wars, and anarchy? John A. Stormer, author of the seven-mill ion-copy best seller, None Dare Call It Treason, has written another book called The Death of a Nation, where he has documentive proof that the riots of the late 1960's were Communist inspired: \"The Riots, Looting, sniper attacks on pol ice and massive civil di sturbances which have racked American cities since 1964 are part of the Communist program for destroying America's ability to resist. \"In February 1967, FBI Ch ief J. Edgar Hoover told a co mmittee of the U.S. Congress: 'Communists and other subversives and extremists strive and labor ceas elessly to precipitate racial trouble and take advantage of racial discord in this country. Such elements were active in exploiting and aggravating the riots, fo r example, the Harlem, Watts, Cleveland, and Chicago.' \" Quoted from The Death of a Na tion, Stormer, Liberty Bell Press, 1968, p. 24. Now, another question should be asked. W ho are the Communists? Wh ere did they actually come from? Did they just appear out of thin ai r? Or are they too just another pawn for a much larger circle of hidden instig ators that want to provoke revol ution, riots, race wars, and anarchy? As we continue to study the Great Luci ferian Conspiracy, the reader will learn that Luciferian fronts designed to destroy all controlling governme nts and religions are the real hidden instigators of all the Communist Pa rties of the world, and Communism actually derived out of Spiritua lism (Witchcraft)! And the diabol ical scheme of the Manson Family"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"and the riots of the sixties are only a shadow of what Lucifer's plans are for the future. The whole world is to be thrown into riot a nd Revolution by these conspirators, as a way to frighten the inhabitants into a one world government. Just to show what people can be led to do by a false religious spirit, Susan Atkins, one of the murderers of Sharon Tate and a membe r of the Manson Family Conspirac y, with her puppy-dog eyes and childish manner, told a jail inmate that she helped kill Sharon Tate, and said: \"YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REAL LOVE IN YOUR HEART TO DO TH IS FOR PEOPLE\" [40]. What could lead these people we just read about to train their cons ciences to accept these murders and social upheavals they tried to caus e? The real source and blame can be placed on those whom Satan used duri ng the 18th, 19th and 20th centur ies who were responsible fo r reviving the sciences of Witc hcraft. Manson, and the Communist Party, are products of the writings of Emanuel Swedenburg, Adam Weis haupt, Sir Richard Kell y, Eliphas Levi, Karl Marx, Madame Blavatsky, Aleist er Crowley, Margaret Murry, Ge rald B. Gardner, just to name a few. We will examine this more as we continue. To show the reader how Witchcraft is gaining control, on October 31, 1971, Leo Martello, long an activist for civil and ga y rights, organized a \"Witch-In\" in New York's Central Park. He finally obtained a permit from the Parks De partment to stage his demonstration with the determined efforts of the New York Civil Libert ies Union. Martello shortly after formed what was to become the Witches Anti-Defamation L eague, devoted to securing religious rights fo r Witches [40]. Then later, Isaac Bonewits, a self-proclaimed male Witch, and a number o f other occultists formed the AADL, the Aqua rian Anti-Defamation League, we often hea r about. This organization is de dicated to fighting legal battles on beha lf of pagans and occultists [41]. As stated earlier, Witchcraft is the biggest rival of modern Christianity. The average gullible Christian has no knowledge of what is happening all around him, even within his own church, about how Spiritualism is a very serious threat. However, we are determined to bring these things out in the light for all to see. But to do this, the reader must have a complete understanding of what these Secret Societies actually are. Like Witchcraft, Freemas ons are bound by oaths and obligati ons under the pain of death i f they should prove willfully guilty of violating any part of thei r solemn oaths or obligations. One of their obligations is toward their brother Mason. In the Masonic Hand Book, on page 183 we read: \"Whenever you see any of our signs made by a brother Mason, and especially the grand hailing sign of distress, y ou must always be sure to obey them , even at the risk of your life. I f you're on a jury, and the defendant is a Ma son, and makes the Gra nd Hailing sign, you must obey it; you must DISAGREE WITH YOUR BROTHER JURO RS, IF NECESSARY; BUT YOU MUST BE SURE NOT TO BRING THE MASON GUILTY FOR THAT WOULD BRING DISGRACE UPON THE OR DER. IT MAY BE PERJUR Y, TO BE SURE, TO DO THIS, BUT THEN YOU'RE FULFILLING YOUR OBLIGATION, AND YOU KNOW IF YOU LIVE UP TO YOUR OBLI GATIONS YOU'LL BE FREE FR OM SIN.\" Quoted in The Masonic Report, McQuaig, p. 9. During the Tate-LaBianCa tria ls - with Susan Atkins testifyi ng to how good it felt when the knife went into Sharon Tate -- Manson was flashing Masonic ha nd signals to the judge [42]. We made a statement a littl e while back that Freemasonr y is nothing less than BAAL WORSHIP. So that there will be no more conf usion about this, we wi ll now let the Masons say so themselves. Here from The Master's Carpet, by Edmond Ronayne, on page 247 we read the following: \"So then Because OUR ANCIENT BR ETHREN -- 'THE OLD SUN-WORSHIPERS' -- MET ON THE HIGHEST HILLS TO WORS HIP BAAL, OR THE SUN-GOD, AND FREEMASONRY BEING THAT SAME WORS HIP REVIVED, IT MUST NECESSARILY FOLLOW THAT MASONIC LO DGES MUST BE HELD IN THE HIGHEST ROOMS OF"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"BUILDINGS, TO CARRY OUT THE COINCIDENCE.\" Quoted from The Mosonic Report, McQuaig, p. 15. Many of the lower Degrees of Freemasonry in America and England will urge that the things we have exposed about Freemasonry thus far are false, because they have been led to b elieve that Freemasonry is a Christian organization. But th e higher Degrees of Freemasonry should know that nothing could be further from the truth. Now it is true that in Christian lands the Bible is placed with a Squa re and a Compass on the altar of their Lodges. However, like the name Solomon, the Bible is just a symbol in Freemasonry, not a st andard of measuring truth. Here again from Albert Pike's Morals and Dogma, page 11, we read the following: \"The Holy Bible, Square, and Compasses, are not only styled the Great Lights in Masonry, b ut they are technically called the Furniture of the Lodge; and, as you have seen, it is held that there is no Lodge without them. This has some times been made a pretext for excluding Jews from our Lodges, Because they cannot regard the New Testam ent as a Holy Book. The Bible is an INDISPENSABLE PART OF THE FU RNITURE OF A CHRISTIAN LODGE, ONLY BECAUSE IT IS THE SACRED BOOK OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION. The Hebrew Pentateuch in a Hebrew Lodge and the Kora n in a Mohammedan one, belong on the Altar; and one of these and the Squa re and Compass, properly un derstood, are the LIGHTS BY WHICH A MASON MUST WALK AND WORK.\" Reader, the truth is, Freemas onry has nothing whatsoever to do wi th the Bible. It is just used as an ornament to attract Christian men into the lodge in Christian lands. In a book, Digest o f Masonic Law, on pages 207 through 209 we find a statement that says this: \"MASONRY HAS NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH THE BIBLE, THAT IT IS N OT FOUNDED ON THE BIBLE, FOR IF IT WERE IT WOULD NOT BE MASONRY, IT WOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE.\" Quoted fr om The Masonic Report, McQuaig, p. 2. Now that the Masonic Books have established that Masonry is the pagan religions of the world under one banner, what about the God of the Bible, the Lord Jesus Christ? Is he worshipped in any of these Masonic Lodge s? From The Masonic Hand Book, page 184, we read: \"Whether you swear or take God's name in vain don' t MATTER SO MUCH. OF COURSE THE NAME LORD JESUS CHRIST AS YO U KNOW, DON'T AMOUNT TO ANYTHING, BUT MAH-HAH-BONE -- O, HORROR! YOU MUST NE VER, ON ANY ACCOUNT, SPEAK THAT AWFUL NAME ALOUD. TH AT WOULD BE A MOST HEINOUS CRIME... UNMASONIC -- UNPA RDONABLE.\" Quoted fr om The Masonic Report, McQuaig, p. 2. Now here we start to see the real colo rs of Freemasonry. Agai n, from the Masonic Hand Book, page 74, we read the following: \"When a Brother re veals any of OUR GREAT SECRETS; WHENEVER, FO R INSTANCE, HE TELLS ANYTHING ABOUT BOAZ, OR TUBALCAIN, OR JACHIN O R THAT AWFUL MAH-HAH-BONE, OR EVEN WHENEVER A MI NISTER PRAYS IN THE NAME OF CHRIST IN ANY OF OU R ASSEMBLIES, YOU MUST ALWAYS HOLD YOURSELF IN READINESS, IF CALLED UPON TO CUT HIS THROAT FROM EAR TO EAR, PULL OUT HIS TONGUE BY THE ROOTS AND BU RY HIS BODY AT THE BOTTOM OF SOME LAKE OR POND.\" Quoted from The Masonic Report, McQuaig, p. 3. Does the reader need to go on and on through the doctrines of Freemasonry to see fo r himself that Freemasonry is anti-Christ, and it speaks as a dr agon? However, we want to make clear to the reader that most Masons do not know these things that have been shown to you, until they reach the hi ghest degrees of Freemasonry. The pattern of deception in Freemasonry is the very same pattern of deceptions f ound in Witchcraft. There are lower and highe r Degrees of knowledge in Witchcraft too. The lo wer class worship at first a system of a godhead with a mother goddess and a pagan savi our of the world. In Egypt, the godhead o f Sun worship was Osiris (the Sun), Isis (the Moon), and Horus (the Star). In Babylon, they"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"were Baal, Ishtar, and Ta mmuz. In Mexico, they were Teotl, Coatlicue, and Quetzalcoatl. All these gods derived from the first King in the worl d, the first builder of cities (mason), and his wife known in history as Semi ramis. Nimrod and his wife Se miramis are where all the Sun- gods and Moon goddesses can be traced and so is it with the religion of Freemasonry. We have already seen that even Freemas ons admit that the founders of their Order were N imrod and Hermes (Cush). But even some chie f adepts of these systems of idolatry are ignorant of this fact. However, when the initia te finally reaches the highest level of pagandom and of Masonry, he discovers fr om the learned Doctors that th ese gods that he was taught to worship do not exist. Initiates are taught to worship these gods at first because within the worship of these gods are knowledge of secret sciences of th e Universe, and the worship o f these gods will teach to the st udent of Freemasonry the discipli ne of a close knit civilized society which is beneficial to mankind. Masons are purposely deceived at first, th en as they progress th rough the higher Degrees o f Masonry (which is nothing less than learning more about the satanic power of Witchcraft), they are gradually conditioned to accept the Luciferian doctrine th at it is Lucife r who is really the god behind all gods. To see this is true, we will go back and quote again a statement by Albert Pike. Pike, writing about the pagan Trinity of the Angle-Saxons, states the following: \"Our northern ancestors wors hipped this Triune Deity; Odi n, the Almighty Father; Frea, his wife, emblem of the universal matter; and Thor his s on, the Mediator. But ABOVE THESE WAS THE SUPREME GOD,'THE AUTHOR OF EVERYTHING THAT EXISTETH, THE ETERNAL, THE ANCIENT, TH E LIVING and AWFUL BEIN G, THE SEARCHER INTO CONCEALED THINGS, THE BEIN G THAT NEVER CHANGETH.' \" Morals and Dogma, Pike, p. 13. Above all the gods, Pike says there is another. Now since we have already seen statements found in authorized books on Freemasonry that this other god is not Jesus Christ, it should not b e hard for the reader to belie ve the shocking truth we are now about to show. Pike knows that these cosmic gods of astrology do not exist, and he plainly stat es how ignorant they are that worship them. From Morals and Dogma, Pike, page 375, we read the following: \"In all the histories of the gods and heroes lay couched and hidden astronomical details and the history of the perations of visible nature; and those in tu rn were also symbols of highe r and profounder truths. None but the RU DE UNCULTIVATED INTELLECTS COULD LONG CONSIDER THE SU N AND STARS AND THE POWERS OF NATURE AS DIVINE, OR AS FIT OBJECTS OF HUMA N WORSHIP: AND THEY WILL CONSIDE R THEM SO WHILE THE WORLD LASTS: AND EVER REMAIN IGNORANT OF THE GREAT SPIRITUAL TRUTHS OF WH ICH ARE THE HIEROGLYPHICS.\" To show that most Mas ons do not know the true purpose of Freemasonry and its god, here again from The Masonic Report, on page 5, McQuaig says: \"That the figures and schemes for th e knowledge and properties of Nature ARE PRESERVED IN MASONRY, but not the pseudo-Masonry of th e majority of the craft members.\" From a Masonic book called Black and Whit e, Hartmen, p. 62, we read: \"FORTUNATE IS THE MASON OR PRIEST WHO UNDERSTA NDS WHAT HE TEACHES. BUT OF SUCH DISCIPLES THERE ARE ONLY A FEW\" Qu oted from The Mosonic Report, p. 5. Now, the Blue Lodge Masonry is a deli berate hoax especially designed to deceive Masonry's ignorant masses into believing that they know something about the secrets o f Masonry, when in reality they know nothing what soever. Albert Pike e xpresses this in his book Morals and Dogma on page 819: \"The Blue Degrees are but the outer or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, BUT HE IS INTENTIONALLY MISLED BY FALSE INTERPRETATIONS. IT IS NOT INTENDED THAT HE SHALL UNDERSTAND THEM;"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"BUT IT IS INTENDED THAT HE SHAL L IMAGINE HE UNDERSTAND THEM. THEI R TRUE EXPLICATION IS RESERVED FOR THE ADEPTS, THE PRINCES OF MASONRY. THE WHOLE BODY OF THE ROYAL AND SACERDOTAL ART WAS HIDDEN SO CAREFULLY CENTURIES SINCE, IN THE HIGH DEGREES, AS THAT IT IS EVEN YET POSSIBLE TO SOLVE MANY OF THE ENIGMAS WHICH THEY CONTAIN. IT IS WELL ENOUGH FOR TH E MASS OF THOSE CALLED MASONS, TO IMAGINE THAT ALL IS CONTAINED IN THE BLUE DEGREES; AND WHOSO ATTEMPTS TO UNDECEIVE THEM WILL LABOR IN VAIN, AND WITHOUT ANY TRUE REWARD VIOLATE HIS OBLIGATIO NS AS AN ADEPT MASONRY IS THE VERITABLE SPHINX, BURIED TO THE HE AD IN THE SANDS HEAPED ROUND IT BY THE AGES.\" From the very first decepti on in the Garden of Eden unto this present day, Satan has caused man to err from the True God by keeping him busy in seeking things that lead away from God. By kindling a desire in Ad am and Eve to go outside the law of God, Satan caused Adam and Eve to lose eternal life. It was self indulgence and self gl orification that led Eve to see k this mysterious knowledge of good and evil. Sata n told Eve by taking th e fruit of the tree o f knowledge, her eyes would be open and she woul d become as gods. In other words, she would reach the great heights of wisdom. Her curiosity was aroused and Satan kindled a desire in he r to want to know about this forbidden knowledge . This same voice has been preserved and heard through the mouths of the Adepts of Freemasonry, and all other Secret Societies and religions that teach Babylonian pr ecepts. This same trap that ma de Eve fall into a snare of the Devil is used the same way today. This same forbidden know ledge Satan used on Eve is today called the Mysteries, to the occultists. In the Bible, it's called \"MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.\" Revelation 17:5. Very few Americans know wh at part Secret Societies ha ve played and are playing in Lucifer's attempt to establish his total rule on this planet. This is and has been a gradual attempt to overthrow Christianity and Jesus Christ. As we stated before, what Lucifer tried to do in Heaven, this world now is experiencing. Instead of a st ruggle only between Lucifer and his angels, and Christ and His Angels, the conflict is now betw een Christ and His people who have His Spirit, and Lucifer a nd his people, who are possessed by him and his devils. Satan is p ouring out his power to his hum an agents to work miracl es and lying wonders without measure, to deceive a nd destroy the very elect of God if possible. \"Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! fo r the Devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.\" Revelation 12:12. Satan has been hiding behind these Secret Soci eties to further his plans in his conspiracy to condition the inhabita nts of this world to accept his rule . But this is only one of his fronts. We will lay wide open, as we did Freemasonry, an even more diabolical scheme to cause inhabitants of this world to lo se their part in what Christ promised in Scripture. As we continue to follow history, we will see how Lucifer will deceive the very elect if possible. Very few loyal American s know what part Freemasonry has played in helping Lucife r establish his total power and rule in this world. American Freemas onry has become a mass movement. In many small towns of the Sout h and middle West, almost every white male Protestant gentleman belongs to a Masonic Lo dge [43]. And sharp di stinctions are drawn between those who belong and those who do not. Masons refer to non-Masons as \"Protanes\" [44]. With millions of members, tens of millions of dollars of assets and property and billions of dollars worth of insurance in force, this should give the reader understanding about how much power is behi nd this Secret Society. The Rosicrucians alone spend $500,000 a year seeking recruits thr ough newspapers and magazines. The advertisement promises to open the door of success, pros perity and popularity. All the mysteries of life and death, reincarnation, extrasensory perception and the s ecrets of the ancient mystical schools will be"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"revealed to those who return the advertisem ent's coupon to the Rosi crucian headquarters in San Jose, California. After the reader sends in the coupon and asks for further information about the Rosicrucian organization, he is sent a booklet entitled, \"M ystery of Life,\" which lists very familiar names in histor y who were identified as Ro sicrucians, such as Benjamin Franklin, Isaac Newton, and Rene Descartes.\" Now the reader has seen from authorized publications of thes e Secret Societies that they do not exalt or worship the Christia n God of the Bible, but exalt the pagan gods of astrology and teach the mysteries of the occult, which is Witc hcraft. It should not be too hard now for the reader to understand w hy we have today these signs of Wi tchcraft mingled within our own United States governmental symbol s. Now that the reader is aw are of the paganism in these Secret Societies and how their own members are deceived into believing that they are Christian organizations, it should not be hard to realize how the inventor of the occult, the god of these Secret Societies, used deceived Ma sons and Rosicrucians to help establish this country. Benjamin Frankli n, himself an expert in occultism, joined one of the first American Lodges of Masonry, and published an editi on of Anderson's Constitution in 1734. George Washington joined the Fredricksburg Lodge of Masonry in Virginia in 1752. Patrick Henry, Paul Revere, and John Paul Jone s wore the apron of Masonry, and so did Benedict Amold [46]. A plaque on the wall that surrounds the Alamo in San An tonio, Texas lists the names o f those who died in the Texas Revolution in February and March of 1836. The plaque was dedicated by the Freemasonry Orde r in honour of Masons who gave their lives there. Among the names are Col. William Travis, James Bowie and David Crockett. Since there have been, from the start, Masonic Presidents, Governors, Senators, and Congressmen making our laws a nd governing the affairs of our Nation, it should not be too hard for the reader to understand how a pagan goddess that Witchcraft ex alts, that the Roman Catholic Church worships as th e Virgin Mary, is standing on t op of the Capitol of the United States of America. It was not by chance that the Capitol Building itself wa s designed after the rotunda, o r dome, of St. Peter's Ba silica in Vatican City. James Hoban, believe it or not, was a Catholic Freemason who designed the Capitol of the Unit ed States and was the chief founder of the Federal Masonic Number 1, in the District of Columbia [47]. Now here are some more astonishing fact s. Has the reader ever wondered how the strange structure called the Washingt on Monument came into being? Well, in the myth of the Egyptian god Osiris, which derived out of the le gends of Nimrod, Osiris was said to have b een killed by a rival god and cut into 14 different pieces. Af ter cutting the b ody of Osiris into 14 pieces, this rival god threw all of the parts of Osir is along the Nile. Is is, his wife, found all the pieces but one, his geni tal member. Now remember, Osiris was worshipped as the Creator, the Impregnating Force of the Univ erse, so the mother goddess Isis moulded with her hands an image of the dead god's phallus, and set up one to be venerated as a monument to Osiris [48]. Hence, the origin of Phallicism. So in the Temp le services of the pagans, a coffin with an image of Osiris' phallus in it became part of the wo rship of the Sun-god. This same p hallic image has been passed down through hist ory to us today. Its name is the obelisk, which even a small child should have seen ma ny times. Gross darkness are the deceptions o f Satan! The obelisk, the sacred phallic symbol of Osiris (Nimrod), is now standing in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, with a cross erec ted on top of its pyramid. And it's also standing 555 feet high in Washington, DC. And this is the origin of the church steeple! It was not by chance that th e Pentagram (5 pointed star) was c hosen to represent states in the American Flag. It was not by ch ance that the Pentagon is shap ed after the center of the Pentagram that Witches and Warlocks get in the center of to cast their spells. It was not by chance that crimson, white and bl ue, three of the four colors of Witchcraft, were chosen to b ecome the colors of the flag. It was not by chance that the Eagle (the ancient symbol o f Lucifer) was chosen to become a symbol of the United States."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" Washington, Jackson, Monroe, Polk, Andr ew Johnson, Garfield, McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, Taft, Hardi ng, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Truman and Ford were all Freemasons. President Harding was only a 1st Degree Mas on in his hometown Lodge. But when he was elected President, he quickly advanced from 1st to 32nd Degr ee. Harry Truman once served as Grand Master of the Gra nd Lodge of Missouri. Eisenhower and Kennedy were not Masons, b ut L.B. Johnson took the 1st De gree in a Lodge in Texas, t hough he did not continue [49]. Gerald Ford is a high ranking Mason today. Other well known personali ties in America who have been members of a Masonic Lodge were John Jacob Astor, Irving Berlin, Luther Burbank, Henry Clay, Thomas E. Dewey, Henry Ford, Barry Goldwater, Samuel Compers, J. Edgar Hoover, Char les Lindbergh, General Douglas McArthur, Andrew Mellon, General John J. Pers hing, Will Rogers, Sigmund Romberg, John Philip Sousa, Mark Twain, a nd Chief Justice Earl Warren, who by the way investigated the mysterious death of Kennedy which still remains mysterious. It would not be unusual in a ny single year for the majority of state Governors, United States Senators, and Representatives to be members of Freemasonry [50]. Ho wever, it is quite evident that most of these loyal Americans we re not aware of the real satanic character o f their fraternities. What our founding fathers de signed to protect Americ an citizens from both governmental and religious tyranny was, and is still today, a shie ld against any religion using legislation to force its belie fs on others, as did the pap acy during the Middle Ages. America, during the brutal Inquisitions, was still a wilder ness and became a haven for Bible- b elieving Christians. This wilder ness land that was later to be called the United States hid God's Bible- b elieving people from the pe rsecuting power of the Dr agon, which in Prophecy is a symbol of Satan and Satan's religion. The Roman Catholic Church was a false religious system that caused the Protestants to flee from the Old European countries, to come to America. This was foretold in Revelation 12:14: \"And to the woman were gi ven two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, wher e she is nourished for a time, a nd times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.\" In the next chapter we will study in detail how the papacy for 1260 years, as foretold, cast the Truth to the ground. And in this next chapter we will see how the Bible foretold Communism and how Comm unism, like Freemasonr y , derived out of S p iritualism.

This book is a Testimony from Chri st Himself, not from the Apostle John.

These three great powers we will learn about from the prophecies are the Roman Catholic Church, The Illuminati , and American Protestantism. It will be th ese three powers that will bring Lucifer's great C onspiracy to its final stage. To begin this study, we mu st turn to Revelation Chapter 17, and study it in detail. Here is the Prophecy: \"And there came one of the seven angels which had the seve n vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the iudgm ent of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: With w hom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, an d the inhabitants of the earth ha ve been mode drunk with the wi ne of her fornication. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness; and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of na mes of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple a nd scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations a nd filthiness of he r fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. AND I SAW THE WOMAN DRUNKEN WITH THE BL OOD OF THE SAINTS, AND WITH THE BLOOD OF THE MARTYRS OF JESUS: and wh en I saw her, I w ondered with great admiration. And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, AND OF THE BEAS T THAT CARRIED HER, WHICH HATH THE SEVEN HEADS AND TEN HORNS. The beast that thou sawest was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is. And here is a mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is o f the seven, and goeth into perdition. And the te n horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beest. These have one mind, and shall give their power unto the beast. These SHALL MAKE WAR WITH THE LAMB AND THE LAMB SHALL OVER COME THEM: FOR HE IS LORD OF LORDS, AND KING OF KI NGS: AND THEY THAT AR E WITH HIM ARE CALLED, AND CHOSEN, AND FAITHFUL. AND HE SAITH UNTO ME, THE WATERS WHICH THOU SAWEST, WHERE THE WHOR E SITTETH, ARE PEOPLES, AND MULTITUDES, AND TONGUES. AND TH E TEN HORNS WHIC H THOU SAWEST UPON THE BEAST THESE SHALL HATE THE WHORE, AND SHALL MAKE HE R DESOLATE AND NAKED, AND SHALL EA T HER FLESH, AND BURN HER WITH FIRE. FOR GOD HATH PUT IT IN THEIR HEARTS TO FULFIL HIS WILL, AND TO AGREE, AND GIVE THEIR KINGDOM UN TO THE BEAST UNTIL THE WORDS OF GOD SHALL BE FULFILLE D. AND THE WOMAN WHIC H THOU SAWEST IS THAT GREAT CITY WHICH REIGNETH OV ER THE KINGS OF THE EARTH.\" Now, let's back up and read a few verses at a time and search the Scriptures for the interpretation. Verses 1-5 pict ure a lewd woman with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and she al so has made the other inhabita nts of the earth drunk with the wine of her fornication. This wo man was seen in vision as sitti ng on a scarlet beast, full o f names of blasphemy, having seve n heads and ten horns. The lewd woman was also arrayed in p urple and scarlet colour, decked with gold and precious stone s, pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominati ons and filthiness of her fornic ation. And on her forehead was a name written - MYSTERY, BABYLON TH E GREAT THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. The Scriptures themselves will show that this is not a real woman here described, but a"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"symbol of the astrological re ligion of Sun worship that we have been studying about. However, there is somewhat of a parallel betw een this prophecy of this lewd woman and the real life of Semiramis who was the wife of Ninus (Nimrod). It was Semiramis who in history was worshipped in Egypt as Isis, or to the Ba bylonians as Ishtar, or to the Israelites as Ashtaroth, or in India Isi, or in Rome Cybele, or in Mexico Co atlicue, All the crafts of the occult can be traced back to this evil fami ly of Cush (Hermes), Nimrod (Baal) and Semiramis (Ishtar). As Scripture states, Nimrod was the son of Cush who was the son of Ham, who was the son of Noah. Genesis 10:6,8. Now, in the legends of Ni mrod, who was Ninus to the Assyri ans, it is stated by ancient historians that Ninus, the husba nd of Semiramis [1], was killed as we have already seen, by a rival god, and cut into several pieces. Both the Babylonian god Tammuz and the Egyptian go d Osiris were worshipped as the personifi cation of the Sun-god. And, according to thei r legends, were killed by a rival god. In the Babylonian version, Ta mmuz was killed by a \"certain king\" for trying to introduce the reli gion of Astrology. Who coul d this \"certain king\" b e that killed this ringleader of apostasy? Who opposed the worship of the God of Noah an d Shem? Hislop says these legends of Tammuz' and Osiris' deaths can be traced through history to Nimrod and Shem, Shem is the Biblical lineage from wh ich Christ was born and Shem in the Egyptian myth was the rival god named Se t or Seth or Typhon [2], who was worshippe d as the god Shom by the people of India [3]. So you see, all the legends of the Sun-gods can be traced back to the Babylonian religions. Hence, Bacchus to the Phoenicians, Hercules to the Assyrians, Dionysus to the Grecians, Attis to the Romans, Krishna to the Indians of India, Quetzalcoatl to the Mexicans, Balder to the Scandinavians, Pan-ku to the Chinese and Pa n to both the ancient and modern Witchcraft cults, are just photocopies of Nimrod as we have already stated many times. The various goddesses throughout the world also derived out of the legends of the first goddess, Semiramis, who was the wife of Ninus (Nimrod). It wa s Semiramis (Ishtar to the Babylonians), who was a witch he rself, that established the Ri te of Sacred Prostitution that witches today call \"The Great Rite.\" Semi ramis was worshipped as the Great Mothe r Goddess, the Queen of Heaven, the goddess of all impurity, the goddess of Love and Sex, an d also of War, and as Athena, th e goddess of Wisdom. It appears that it is this version of the Greek goddess who is standing on top of the rot unda of the Capitol of the United States. Another tradition in Greece has this pagan goddess as Aphr odite, the goddess of exciting sexual desires. During the French Revolution, which we will study later, the revolutionaries banned all Christianity and burned Bibles. The worship of God was forbidden and the Jacobin Clubs ha d legislated within the laws of their new government that the Ch ristian God of the Bible was a false god. In place of the Bible and the worship of Jesus they exalted this same goddess who was also known as the goddess of Reason and of Liberty. This same goddess is standing in N ew York Harbor as a gift from France. Now, in Revelation 17:2, we read the foll owing: \"With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the i nhabitants of the eart h have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.\" What is the interpreta tion according to the Bible the meaning behin d \"wine of her fornication?\" Turn in your Bibles to Ezekiel the sixteenth chapter and we will learn the interpretation thereof. In Ezekiel 16:1- 14 the Lord symbolically describes his chosen p eople as an unwanted baby, on whom the Lord took pity and raised up into a beautiful, p rosperous kingdom. However, when the Israelites turned their backs on the Lord and turne d to idolatry, the Lord called Is rael a \"harlot.\" \"But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, an d p layedst the HARLOT because of thy renow n, and pouredst out thy FORNICATIONS on every one that passed by; his it was.\" Ezekiel 16:15. Before the Israelites went into the Promised Land, the Lord told Moses to instruct them: \"I am the Lord your God.

However, anyone who has ever read the Old Testament has learned that the Israelites mingled with the people of Cana an and learned their customs. They took the heathen customs and mingled them with the sacred things of God. Even before they entered into the land o f Canaan, when Moses went up M ount Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments, the Israelites fell into idolatry [3]. This may also be seen when Joshua died, Judges 2:8-10. After Joshua died, we read in Judges 2:11-14 th e following: \"And the children of Israel did evil in the sigh t of the Lord, and served Baalim. And they forsook the Lord God of their Fathers, which b rought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bow ed themselves unto them, an d provoked the Lord to anger. And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sol d them into the hands of their enemies round a bout, so that they could not any longer stan d before their enemies.\" The problem of the pagan influences penetr ating into the ranks of Israel was because the leaders of Israel allowed pagan customs, little by littl e, to creep in among the sacred things o f God. In Ezekiel 22:26 we read: \"Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference be tween the holy and profaned, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and th e clean, and have hid their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.\" It was the mingling of pa gan philosophies within the sacr ed ordinances and commandments of our Lord that led Israel to finally aba ndon the worship of the Tr ue God, and bow down an d worship images that were symbol s of the cosmic gods of Astr ology. And so is it today. The whole world has been intoxicated with \"the wine of her forn ication\" which means, deceive d by the seducing religion and doctrines of the astrological religion of Sun-worship. You might ask how that c ould be. Well, in the book Beware Its Coming - The Antichrist 666, published by W.F.G. Inc., we read: \"In the legend of the Tauric Goddess Diana, it is said that every stra nger who landed on he r shore was sacrificed on her alta r. Have you ever wondered what the Christmas Tree has to do with the Birth of Christ? Or the ornaments you place on the tree, or the meaning of the word, 'YULETIDE?' Or where the trad ition of the mistletoe came fr om and how it became a symbol of Christmas? Reader, they have nothing whatso ever to do with the bi rth of Jesus, but are some of the traditions observed to honor the birth of pagan godchild Tammuz. There is no Scriptural evidence that supports the Birth of Christ as bei ng December 25th; but history says December 25th was kept thousands of years befo re the Birth of Christ, in honor of the pagan Messiah. Another name for Tammuz, the pagan god-child, was 'Baal- b ereth,' which means: 'Lord of the Fir-Tree.' \"The Sun-god, the Mother goddess, and her son, according to Babylonian mythology were mystically changed into trees. This is the origin of burning the Yule Log. Nimrod deified as the Sungod was symbolized by a big fir tree strippe d of all its branches and cut almost to the ground. But the great serpent which symbolized the life restorer, whose name is Aesculapius, twists itself around the dead st ock and lo, at its side a young tr ee - a tree of an entirely different kind, which is destined never to be cut down by hostile power; even the palm tree, the well known symbol of victor y. People of Aryan stock who believed that the oak tree was a symbol of Zeus or Jupiter, be lieved that this Branch was of Mistletoe which grew on the oa k tree, and to be kissed under the mistletoe would insure fertilit y. The Branch was a name given to the Christ, Isaiah 11:1 - 'AND THER E SHALL COME FORTH A ROD OUT OF THE STEM OF JESSE, AND A BRANCH SH ALL GROW OUT OF HIS ROOTS.' \"Now take the word 'Yuletide.' The word yule is as Babylonian as Tammuz. The word yule is the Chaldee word for infant or little ch ild, and the 25th of December was called by the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"p agan Anglo-Saxons,'Yule-day,' or Child's Day. The pagan Egyptians, and the Persians both observed the 25th of December as the birthday of their god. \"In Germanic Mythology, they too, had a supr eme god to whom they ga ve sacrifice. These warlike people promised their god, whose name was TIWAZ, th at if he would give them victory over their enemy, they would give to th eir god all the spoils of the battle. Like the Babylonians, they believed their gods could transform themselves into trees. If the go d answered their prayers, they took their dead vi ctims along with the spoi ls of war, and dragge d them to their sacred grove, a nd there hung them on their sacred trees. Such offerings have b een recovered from the bogs in Germany. This beget the orig in of hanging ornaments from the Christmas Tree. \"Little sheep of the Lord's pasture, it is impossible to ignore the pagan Festival o f Christmas. The World is commemorating the Birth of Christ, not Tammuz. There is an advantage during the Christmas s eason to preach the real Jesu s of the Bible. However, we should keep ourselves from the vanities of the pagan Festival, not to me ntion the cost, and the deaths caused by lighted Christmas Trees. \"There is, however, an oppor tunity during the Christmas Seas on with its beautiful music, to make others aware that Christ is no longer a helpless babe in a manger, but is the Saviour o f the world, the King of kings, Lord of lords. Many who thi nk the Bible and its message is foolishness can be reached during the Christmas Season where it would be almost impossible to talk to them at another time. Even the Chri stmas Tree can be used to teach the children a great lesson. The children s hould be taught that it is a historical fact th at placing bulbs, tinsel, and lights on a Christmas Tree is pure pagan heathenism. \"This pagan custom got its start from killing enemies and hanging their heads and thei r spoils from pagan sacred trees. It would not be a sin if an evergreen tree was set up in the church during the Christmas Season if it was done to be an ob ject lesson. If the parents woul d take the money they spend each year on Chri stmas trees, bulbs, lights, and expensive p resents, and give the money as an offering to advance the preaching of the Gospel, woul d not the Lord be pleased with such a self-sacrifice?\" There are more shocking facts about pagan cu stoms that have been adopted into Christianity that will be revealed as we c ontinue. In the book of Job, we read: \"If I beheld the Sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: This also were an iniquity to be punish ed by the Judge: For I should have denied the God that is above.\" Job 31:26-28. Hence, the symbolic interpretation applied to this Harlot found in Revelation 17:5 (Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Mother of Harlots) is Satan's great re ligious system with its many various sects, that taught the wo rld to obey the precepts of the astrological worship of the Sun, Moon, and the Stars. The Bible says in I Corinthians 10:11,12: \"N ow all these things ha ppened unto them fo r ensamples: and they are written for our ad monition, upon whom the e nds of the world are come. Wherefore let him that thinke th he standeth take heed lest he fall.\" The records of the history of Israel are types that will repeat themselves until Chri st comes. We are warned in the Bible to take heed to Isr ael's fall, lest we fall. It appears from Scriptures that Israel adopted all the main versions of the Babyl onian idolatry in her aposta sy. \"Thou has also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of the flesh; a nd hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger. Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand ove r thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, wh ich are ashamed of thy lewd way. Thou hast p layed the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast uns atiable: Yea, thou hast playe d the unsatiable: Yea, thou hast played the HARLOT with them and yet couldest not be satisfied. Thou hast moreover mult iplied thy fornication in th e land of Canaan unto Chaldea, and yet thou was not satisfie d herewith.\" Ezekiel 16:26, 28."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Now it is time to see from Scripture what the symbol of the Beas t from the Bottomless Pit means that is carrying this Mother of Harlots. A Beast in prophecy is a symbol of a \"political p ower\" or \"kingdom\" as it clearl y shows in Daniel 7:1-8, 17-25. Daniel saw four great beasts and the angel said: \"These great beasts, whic h are four, ARE FOUR KI NGS which shall arise out of the Earth.\" Daniel 7:17. As the Scriptures reveal, the symbolic beasts he re represent four pa gan nations that woul d arise in sequence taking dominion, or ruling ove r the whole known world at that time. These kings were recorded in history as: 1.Babylonian Empire 605 BC to 539 BC, the Li on. 2.Medo-Persian Em pire, 538 BC to 331 BC, the Bear. 3.Grecian Empi re 331 BC to 168 BC, the Leopa rd, 4.Roman Empire 168 BC to 476 AD, the Dragon. When Rome fell in 476 AD, it was to have Ten Nations that woul d arise out of its ruins. \"Thus he said, The fourth beast (Rome) shall be the FOURTH KINGDOM upon earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. And the Ten Horns out of this kingdom are TEN KINGS that shall arise; and another shall rise after them; and he sh all be diverse from the first, and he shall su bdue three kings.\" Daniel 7:23,24. These Ten Nations are also recorded hi story now as the prophecy of Daniel predicte d hundreds of years, earlier. They were the following: 1.Angle-Saxons 2.Franks 3.Alemanni 4.Lomba rds 5.0strogoths 6.Visigoths 7.Burgundians 8.Vandals 9.Suevi 10.Heruli. After these Ten Nations w ould become history, Daniel the Prophet foretold another Little Horn (Nation) was to come up among these Ten Nations and w ould war with them and woul d actually destroy three of the Te n Nations. They would be rooted out of that area called Europe today. And, this is precisely what happened. Th is Little Horn (Nation) destroyed the nations of the Heruli in 493 AD, the Vandals in 534 AD, and the last of the th ree, the Ostrogoths, lost their last battle with this Little Horn (Nati on) in 538 AD and were eventually driven out o f Italy by 554 AD. However, it was in 538 AD that paved the way for this little Nation to take dominion of that area that would become Europe. In Daniel 7:8 we read about this little horn: \"I considered the horns and behold, ther e came up among them another LITTLE HORN, b efore whom there were TH REE OF THE FIRST HORNS PLUCKED UP BY THE ROOTS: and, Behold, in this horn were ey es like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.\" It is a historical fact that the Roman Catholic Church destr oyed the nations of the Heruli, Vandals, and the Ostrogoths. A lthough it was not the Papacy w ho actually did the fighting, it was the Papacy who hired mercenaries to dest roy them. For more facts about the history o f the prophecy of Daniel the 7th Chapter, ma y we suggest you order a copy of Beware It's Coming - The Antichrist 666 from our catalogue which is found in the back of this book. Now in Daniel 7:25 it list s four things that the Little Horn (Papacy) was predicted in p rophecy to do after destroying the Heruli, Va ndals and the Ostrogoths. \"And he shall spea k great words against the most Hi gh, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be gi ven into his hand until a time, times and the dividing of time.\" To see how the Papacy has fulfilled the fi rst prediction Daniel desc ribed here in 7:25, all one has to do is to pick up a local newspaper an d read the words the Papacy speaks when they exalt their present Pope. He is hailed as the Vicar of God, Ch rist in the Flesh. Is this not b lasphemy? All one needs to do to see how the Pa pacy would wear out th e saints of the most high, is to pick up an encyclopedia and read about the inquisitions during the Medieval Age. One had merely to be accused of heresy agai nst papal doctrine or au thority, and this was enough to burn at the stak e. It was the Papacy, not Christ, or His Apostles that changed the original day of worship, the Seventh Day, in to the holy day of th e Sun-god called today Sunday, the first day of the week. We will study this change in more detail later on. Now coming back to the last part of Daniel 's prophecy of the Papacy as the Little Horn,"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Daniel said the Little Horn w ould continue \"until a time, ti mes and the dividing of time.\" To figure the amount of time the Papacy woul d commit blasphemy agai nst the Most High, to wear out the saints of the Mo st High, and would think to cha nge times and laws, we need to read Numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4:6: \"After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, EACH DAY FOR A YE AR, shall ye bear your iniquities, EVEN FORTY YEARS, and ye shall know my breach of promise.\" In Jewish prophecy a day is counted as a year, as shown above. Now in Daniel 7:25, the religious dictatorship of the Pap acy was to be for a \"time, time s and the dividing of time.\" A time in Jewish prophecy represents 360 days of the Jewish calendar. So a day in prophecy equals also one year (Ezekiel 4: 6), and since a time equals 360 days in one Jewish year, Times would be two years or 720 days. Dividing of time equals half a year, or half of 360 days, which would be 180 days. Now in Jewish prophecy a day is also counted as one year as in Ezekiel 4:6 and Numbers 14:34. Here is a better way of explaining this: TIME = 360 days or one year in prochecy TIMES = 720 days or two years in prophecy 1/2 TIME = 180 days or 1/2 year in prophecy TIME=360 TIMES=720 1/2 TIME=180 with a total of 3.1/2 YEARS = 1260 The starting point for the t ime, times, and the di viding of time, or the 1260 years of the Papal Religious Dictatorship would be when the last of the Three Kingdoms was destroyed. This Last Kingdom was the Ostrogot hs. The decisive battle betw een the papal forces and the Ostrogoths was in 538 AD. It was then that the Papacy began to claim they were the \"Corrector of Heretics\"; hence, this began the tyrannical religious dict atorship of the Roman Catholic Church [5]. It was not until the year 1798 AD, that the Papacy completely lost control to dictate its authority to the world. General Berthier from France, during the Napoleonic Wars, was sent to the Vatican in 1798 to seize P ope Plus VI, and he was dethro ned and banished into exile where he later died.\" From the year 538 AD to 1798 AD is actually 1260 years, as the prophecy of Daniel p redicted. Here is a diagram of the complete pr ophecy of Daniel the 7th chapter. The diagram covers a complete picture of the kingdoms of th e world that were foretold from Babylon's 605 BC takeover of the known world, down through the cen turies to the time when Pope plus IV was dethroned. Babylonian Medo-Persian Grecian Empire Roman Em pire Papacy 605-539 BC 539-331 BC 331-168 BC 168 BC-476 AD 538 - 1798 AD Now that we have learned wh at a beast is symbolic of in Sc ripture, let us again examine the 17th chapter of Revelation. As st ated before, Babylon the Great represents ALL religions that teach Babylonlan doctri nes derived from the astrological wo rship of the Sun-god. This covers all the pagan religions and ALL Christian church es that have mingled heathenism with the sacred things of God. \"Ye ca nnot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.\" 1.Corinthians 10:21. Now it's time to look at the Beast that ascends out of th e Bottomless Pit, that the false religious systems of the Worl d are riding on. In Revelation 17: 7-18, we read the following: \"And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell th ee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns. The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into p erdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the b ook of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is. And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The se ven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. And there are seven kings: five are falle n, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. And the beast that"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"was, and is not, even he is the eighth and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition. And the ten horns which thou sawest are te n kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive p ower as kings one hour with th e beast. These have one mind and shall give their power an d strength unto the beast. THESE SHALL MA KE WAR WITH THE LAMB, and the LAMB SHALL OVEACOME THEM: FOR HE IS LO RD OF LORDS, AND KING OF KINGS: AND THEY THAT ARE WITH HIM ARE CALLED, AND FAITHFUL. And he said unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the w hore sitteth, are people s, and multitudes, an d nations, and tongues. And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her deso late and naked and shall eat he r flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will , and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth ove r the kings of the earth.\" This prophecy, symbolizing a confederacy of false religious systems and pol itical powers uniting agai nst Jesus (the Lamb), and His people, is for us who liv e in these closing days of th is world's history. The Key that unlocks this prophecy and shows who this beast is that ascend s out of the Bottomless Pit, an d when it makes its appearance, is in Revela tion the 11th chapter. We will compare prophecies of Revelation the 11th chapter with Revelation the 17th chap ter. In Revelation the 11th chapter we read the following: \"And there was gi ven me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar and them that worship therein. But the court which is wi thout the temple leave out, and me asure it not: for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months. And I will give power unto my TW O WITNESSES, and they sh all prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackclot h. These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of earth. A nd if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any ma n will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of thei r p rophecy: and have power over the waters to tu rn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. And when th ey shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the Bottomless Pit SHALL MAKE WAR AGAINST THEM, AND SHALL OVERCOME THEM, AND KILL THEM. An d their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great cit y, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lor d was crucified. And they of the people and ki ndreds and tongues and na tions shall see thei r dead bodies THREE DAYS AND AN HALF: and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dw ell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, an d shall send gifts one to another; because these two pr ophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. And after THREE DAYS AND AN HALF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE from God entere d into them, and they stood upon th eir feet; and great fear fe ll upon them which saw them. An d they heard a great Voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascende d up to heaven in a cloud; and th eir enemies beheld them. And th e same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the eart hquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. The secon d woe is past; and behold, the third woe cometh quickly. And the seve nth angel sounded; an d there were great voices in heaven, sayi ng, THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD ARE NOW BECOME THE KINGDOMS OF OUR LORD, AND OF HIS CHRIST; AND HE SHALL REIGN FOR EVER AND EVER. A nd the four and twenty elde rs, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshi pped God, Saying, We gi ve thee thanks, O Lor d God Almighty, which art, and was, and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great p ower, and hast reigned. And the notions were angry, and thy wrath is co me and the time o f the dead, that they should be judged, and that t hou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the p rophets, and to the saints, a nd them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest DESTROY THEM WHICH DESTROY THE EART H. And the temple of God was opene d"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.\" This prophecy will take us from the time the Papacy began to lose its controlling power to dictate to the world until the Second Coming of Jesus. In Revelation 11:1-5, it says: \"An d there was given me a reed lik e unto a rod: and the angel st ood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, a nd they that worship therein. But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not: for it is given unto the Ge ntiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot FORTY AND TWO MONT HS. And I will give power unto my TWO WITNESSES, AND THEY SHALL PR OPHESY A THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THREESCORE DAYS CLOTHED IN SA CKCLOTH. These are the TWO OLIVE TREES, and the TWO CANDLESTICKS standing be fore God of earth. And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth th eir enemies: A nd if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.\" Again we se e this time peri od of 1260 days, which in prophecy represents 1260 years (Numbers 14:24; Ezek iel 4:6). The periods of 1260 days and 42 months are the same . The ancient Jewish calendar has 360 days in a year and 30 days in a month. Forty two months equals 1260 days (years in Bible prophecy). 42 months x 30 days = 1260 years This prophecy is the same time period we studied in Daniel 7:25, the time, times an d dividing of time, that the Papacy was foretold to \"speak greet words against the Most High, wear out the saints of the Most High, think to change times and laws.\" This time period, as we examined, started in the year 538 AD and reached up through the centuries until 1798 AD when the French army seized Pope Plus VI, and sent him into exile where he died. Even though another Pope was reinstated soon afterwards, the Papacy lost its control to run the affairs of the world. During this time of papal persecution the Holy Scriptures were kept from the ordinary p eople. The Papacy claimed onl y priests could interpret th e Scriptures, and when the Scriptures were read it was usually given in Latin, which the great masses didn't understand. The suppression of the Holy Script ures by the Papacy was also foretold in the symbols of the two witnesses, who were also symbolized as two olive trees, or two candlesticks. \"...and I will give power unto my TWO WITNESSES, and they shall prophesy a THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THREES CORE DAYS (1260 years) clothe d in sackcloth. These are the TWO TREES, AND THE TWO CANDLESTICK S STANDING BEFORE GOD of the earth.\" Revelation 11:3.4. The most popular opinion found among the Doct ors of Theology is th at the two witnesses are two prophets that shall come during the Great Tribulation Period, whil e some say that this p rophecy of the two witnesses has a two-fold meaning. However, the Scriptures and recorde d history show that the prophecy about the two witnesses has indeed come to pass. Jesus our Lord said : \"And this Gospel of the kingdom sh all be preached in all the world fo r a WITNESS UNTO ALL NAT IONS and then shall the e nd come.\" Matthew 24:14. The Gospel taught from the Scriptur es was to be a witness to all nations about the loving an d saving power of Jesus Christ. It gives its hearers correcti on in right doing. It gives its b elievers hope for the future, and the promise of forgiveness for past sins through the sacrifice of Christ's death. \"And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the Devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.\" 2.Timothy 2:26. However, when the Roman Catholic Church became a religious dict atorship, the Scriptures were hidden from the vast po pulation, and catechism was substi tuted instead of Bible study. The Gospel of the Bible becam e mingled with the pagan philo sophies of Sun worship. The worship of the pagan Mother goddess became the idol of the Ro man Catholic Church through the worship of the Virgin Mary.' When the Gospel became perverte d through Romanism, Go d always had a remnant people who were teac hing the True Faith during the 1260 years the Papacy cast the Truth to the ground. These faith ful followers of Jesus were hunted down by"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"p apal authorities as heretics and criminals. They were tortured on the rack, burned at the stake; and it mattered not what age or sex, they were butchered in the name of Heaven. When those faithful serv ants who proclaimed the sacred truths from the Old and New Testaments were tortured, murdered, thrown in dungeons and had to flee for their lives from the papal Inquisitors, the True Faith was forced to go underground. The Go spel set forth in the Old and New Testament that had to be preached into all the world for a witness to all nations b efore Christ would come again, was forced into a state of obs curity. This is what is meant by Revelation 11:3, \"And they shall pro phesy a THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THREESCORE DAYS CLOTHED IN SACKCLOTH.\" Sackcloth was worn by th e Israelites in times of tr ouble and grief. (2.Samuel 3:31, 1.Chronicles 21:15, 16; Isaiah 37: 1). The sackcloth here menti oned in Revelation 11:3 was to mourn the supression of the Old and New Test ament by the papal authorities during the 1260 years. The two witnesses, the two olive trees, or the two candlesticks represented the light the Scripture gives its reader. The Olive Tree was the Israel ites' source of oil to anoint their kings and priests. Oil has often, in Biblical language, be en a symbol of the Holy Sp irit. See Zechariah 4:1-14. The Candlestick represents the illumination a sear cher of Truth receives in the heart when he makes the Word of God his standard to measur e Truth to live by. \"Thy word is a LAMP unto my feet, and a light unto my path.\" Psalms 119:105. \"All scripture is given by in spiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, fo r correction, for instruction in righteousness.\" 2.Timothy 3:16 \"And if any man will hurt th em, fire proceedeth out of their mouths, and devoureth thei r enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he mu st in this manner be killed. These have powe r to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy. And ha ve power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.\" Revelation 11:5,6. This prophecy is a parall el with that of Jesus in Re velation 22:18,19. \"For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of this pr ophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto h im the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, G od shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the Holy City, and from the things wh ich are written in this book.\" This will be the fate of ALL those who tamper with the sacred Scripture. These warnings were given by God to warn men against changi ng or adding to anythi ng written in the Holy Scriptures. The Scriptures reve al God's plan for man from the beginning of creation until Christ's Second Coming, and also how he will provide for man after this Age. The Scriptures were given for man as a guide throughout his lif e to lead him through the gates of the New Jerusalem where he will dwell with God himself. (Revelation 21:1-4). \"And when they shall have finished their testimony, the be ast that ascendeth out of the Bottomless Pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them, and kill them. An d their dead bodies shall lie in the streets of the great ci ty, which SPIRITUALLY is calle d Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lo rd was crucified.\" Revelation 11:7. This beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit is ofte n confused with the Papacy, but this is not a prophecy of the Pa pacy since this prophecy starts near the end of the 1260 years. For 1260 years the Papacy did exact ly what was foretold in Daniel 7:8, 23-25. However, the Papacy never made war on the Scriptures, she just locked them up in an unknown tongue. This Beast that ascendeth out of the botto mless pit is another polit ical power that was to take the place of the Papacy in France, that Satan woul d use to try to dest roy the word of God. Ellen G. White in her multimil lion seller, The Great Controvers y, says that this beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit is not the Papacy, but ANOTHER NEW manifestation o f satanic power:"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" \"The period when the two witnesses were to prophesy clot hed in sackcloth, ended in 1798. As they were approaching the termination of their work in obscurity, war was to be made upon them by the power represented as 'the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit.' In many of the nations of Europe th e powers that ruled in church and state had for centuries been controled by Satan through the me dium of the papacy. But here is brought to view a new manifestation of satanic power. \" Ellen White goes on to say: \"According to the words of the prophet, th en, a little before the year 1798 some power o f satanic origin and charact er would rise to make war upon the Bible. And in the land where the testimony of God's two witnes ses should thus be silenced, there would be manifest the atheism of the Pharoah and the licentiousness of Sodom. \"This prophecy has received a most exact and striking fulfil lment in the history of France. During the Revolution, in 1793, 'the world for the first time he ard an assembly of men, born and educated in civilization, and assuming the right to govern one of the finest of the European nations, uplift their united voice to deny the most solemn truth which man's soul receives, and renounce unanimously the beli ef and worship of a Deity.\" The Great Controversy, White, Pacific Pr ess Publishing, 1939, pp. 239, 240. The beast that ascendeth out of the bottoml ess pit is the santanic force that caused the French Revolution and the overthrow of papal christianity shortly before the Papacy lost Pope Plus VI as its religious dict ator. It is extremely importan t that the reader have some knowledge of the French Revolut ion to unmask this same sa tanic force working now in ou r time that will eventually involve the whole world. This Secret Revolutionary Force that had its beginnings in the French Revolution is just another tool Lucifer has, and is using to further his plan to esta blish his eventual total Rule in this world. This Secret Revolutionary Force is predicted by Scripture to unite with the Mothe r of Harlots, which is a symbol of the Roman Ca tholic Church, Apostate Protestantism, and all other religious moveme nts that teach Babylonian Illu minism, or Spirtualism. This Confederacy between the false reli gions and the political powers of this world is just history repeating itself. It is another attempt to unite man under one banner leaving the Lord out, as it was in the days of Nimrod. We need to look inside the history of the French Re volution and study the subversive groups that actually caused the Re volt. History books tell us that the French Revolution first b egan in 1787 or 1789 [8] depending on whic h book you read. However, it was actually p lanned by Dr. Adam Weishaupt and the House of Rothschild almost 20 years before the Revolution took place. Dr. Adam Weishaupt produced the blue pr int for it, while the House of Rothschil d p rovided the money. This Apostle of Lucifer, Adam Weishaupt was born a Jew, converted to Catholicism, then turned to Witchcraft, where he became an expert, a nd founded another sect of the Illuminati. This sect of illuminati was founded May 1st, 1776 [9]. Like Freemasonry, the Illuminati is a Luciferian movement to preser ve and promot e the ancient Black Arts o f Babylonian and Druid Witchcra ft. Its goals are to destr oy Christianity and all worl d governments, and then unite them under a one world government whose ruler is Lucifer. In the Bible, our Lord chos e a priestly Order of Israelites to preserve the sacred things o f God. In the Old Testament they were known as the Levites Numbers 1:47, 54. The whole N ation of Israel was to be a nation of priests, but because of her idolatry, our Lord only chose the children of Levi [10]. The Levites were in charge of the tabernacle of God and all that pert ained to it. No one was allowed to set-up, move, or perfo rm any service of the tabernac le, but the Levites. Those who even touched the Ark of the Covenant, ot her than a Levite, would suffer death. Like the Levite had his mi nistry for the chosen people, so had the Prophets of God. If any man claimed to be sent from God and predicted things to co me, but they didn't happen, this was to be a sign to the Israel ites that this man was not of G od, and they were to kill him fo r"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"deceiving the people. Just as G od foretold the future and work ed miracles among His people, so does Lucifer have his syst em of counterfeiting the power of God. And, just as God chose a people that would preserve a nd promote His Mystery of Godl iness (1.Timothy 3:16), so has Lucifer chosen a people that would preserve and promot e his Mystery of Iniquity (2.Thessalonians 2:7). One such priestly order that preserved the ancient Black Arts of Witchcraft was the Druids. There are modern day Or ders of this system of Witchcra ft. As the Levites and Prophets were to Israel, so were the Druids to the Celtic peoples. The Celts believ ed that they were a supernatural people from outer space, and their magical powers were to be preserved through their descendants through the centuries. Much modern English and Am erican Witchcraft is modeled from the pagan religi ous rites and magic of the Dr uids, who borrowe d their crafts from the Egyptian Sun worship, which came from the Babylonians and Assy rians. Sacrifices were prominent in Celtic ritual; human and animal sacrifices look place at their sacre d festivals. The Druids held a dominant position in Celtic so ciety for it was they who invoke d the magical powers to ensure prosperity and su ccess. Like the American Indian Witchdoctor, the Druids often fell into trances in order to forecast events.\" The modern fraternities of Freemasonry, Rosicrucians, Golden Dawn, Wicca, Church o f America, Gardinarian Brotherhood , Church of All Worlds, and Process Church of the Final Judgment (of which Charles Manson was a member), are onl y a few of the multitudes o f Witchcraft groups opera ting today behind the public eye, preserving and promoting ancient Witchcraft. However, it was this Witchc raft school called the illuminati of Bavaria that was predicted to make open, avowed war on the Bible through th e \"political world.\" This world power, symbolized as the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit, was pr edicted to destroy the Bible (Two Witnesses) in the street of a city that is called (spir itually) Sodom and Egypt, \"where also our Lord was crucified.\" Revelation 11:7.8. This is not Jerusalem, as it has often be en interpreted, but Paris, France. During the end o f p apal supremacy in the 1700's, Ad am Weishaupt began to write down his pl ans to destroy all governments and religions. Atheis m was to be used as a tool to destroy the Roman Catholic Church which then was the controlling powe r in Europe. Adam Wei shaupt's revolutionary force was first launched under the name of the Perfectibilist s (Gesellschaft de r Perfectibilisten), which posed as a political moveme nt to destroy tyranny and ignorance, an d further the cause of Reason, Freedom and moral virtue [12 ]. Adam Weishaupt was a professor of Canon La w at Ingolstadt, and he also was an ex-Jesui t p riest. Posing at first as a reli gious reformer and a li beral in politics, he attracted many to his p olitical movement, which was also known as Republicanism [13]. He adopted the Jesuits' system of espionage [14], intr oduced Witchcraft to his follow ers, and developed a fraternity within his political movement that was akin to Freemasonry. After he formed his organization, with financial back ing from the House of Rothsch ild [15], he adopted the name Illuminati. They also became known as \"Free Thinkers,\" \"The Enlightened Ones,\" or \"The Enlightenment,\" names given befo re Weishaupt's time to the 17t h century French writers with an atheistic, anti-Christian slant [16]. In Germany, before May 1s t, 1776, they were the German Rationalists, or Humanists, The y, too, promoted Atheism and openly attacke d Christianity and all religions as false, foolish and weird [ 17]. Adam Weishaupt taught his disciples that the illuminati are the only members of the human race who are truly enlightene d and know \"what it's all about.\" Weishaupt had his followers believing that they were to be the cream of the intelligentsia, or the only people with the mental capacity, the knowledge, the insight and understanding necessary to govern the world and bri ng peace [18]. However, only a few of his chosen members actually know We ishaupt personally, and he was regarded by those who had not seen hi m almost as a god [19]."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" Gerald B. Winrod, D.D ., in his booklet, \"Communism Prophecy History America,\" compiled documentive proof of how Adam Weishaupt cleverly concealed his identity an d b ecame the most powerful figure of his day. Winrod explains how Weishaupt set in motion forces that actually destroyed mill ions of lives, and left his mark of evil to be felt in all future generations without even be ing heard of by most people . Winrod on page 45 of his boo k quotes from a letter that Adam Weish aupt wrote to an intimate friend: \"My circumstances necessita te that I should remain hidden from most of the members as long as I live. I am obliged to do ever ything through five or six persons.\" On another occasion he said : \"...one must show how easy it wo uld be for one clever head to direct hundreds of thousands of men.\" Again he wrote: \"I have tw o immediately below me into which I breathe my whole spirit, and each of th ese two has again two others, and so on. In this way I can set a thousand men in motion and on fire in th e simplest manner, and in this way one must impart orders and operate on po litics.\" Weishaupt recrui ted into his ranks as many young men of wealth and position as possibl e. Within four or five years Weishaupt's Illuminati became very powerful and even had his members dire cting the affairs of Germany. Weishaupt's goal was to hide the sciences of Witchcraft behind philanthropy, destroy Christianity with humanism (atheism), then set up a One World Government. In Des Griffin's book, Fourth Reich of the Rich, he shows the outline plan of Weishaupt's World Revolution that he hoped to pr oduce by these following statements: 1. Abolition of all ordered Gove rnments 2. Abolition of Privat e Property 3. Abolition of all Inheritance 4. Aboliti on of Patriotism 5. Abolition of all Religion 6. A bolition of the Family 7. Creation of a World Government [20]. Weishaupt, who was only 28 wh en he founded the Order of the Illumi nati on May 1st, 1776, did not make much progre ss until he met a high ranki ng Freemason named Baron Von Knigge. Von Knigge was not onl y a high ranking Freemason, but he also had been admitte d as a Master of most of the Secret Societies of his day. Von Knigge was, like Weishaupt an d all Masters of these Secret Soci eties, an expert occultist.\" To spread his Order and give the Illumi nati higher influence in the world, and because Freemasonry is akin to Illumi nism, Weishaupt connected with the Masonic Institution. He was initiated in 1777 into Freemasonry in a Lodge at Munich [22] that he planned to use to p romote his world revolutionary ideas. Baron Von Knigge joined Weishaupt's Order in 1780 [23], and soon became a leader , dividing with Adam Weishaupt the control and direction o f the Order. All initiates of the Illuminati were required to take an oa th to secrecy and bin d themselves to perpetual sile nce, unshakable loyalty, and s ubmission to the Order. Like Freemasonry, only a few top men within their organization actually understood their true goals. The world accepts Freemas onry as a Great Benevolent So ciety, teaching the highest p ossible degree of morality and virtue. Since Freemasonr y enjoyed prestige and honour, Adam Weishaupt and Baron Von Knigge planned a world take- over by using the Fraternal Order of Freemasonry. Their plan was to penetrat e into the high levels of the Order, then take control in directing the affairs of the nati ons into an eventual One World Government. However, since papal Christianity was both C hurch and State, and ha d been the dominating p ower that Satan used to control the affairs of the world in Weisha upt's time, Satan was making ready an even worse sata nical influence that would grad ually unite all paganism, false Christianity and all governments of the world, under one banner. Weishaupt's first step was, however, to get control of the International Order o f Freemasonry. In order to gain control of th e Order of Freemasonry, Weishaupt and Baron Von Knigge tried to sell th e leaders of Freemasonry on the idea that their Order of the Illuminati had a higher, much older and more mysterious system than any of the highe r degrees of Masonry. In its inte rnal organization, the Order of the Illuminati was divided into three great classes: (1) The Nursery (2) Sy mbolic Freemasonry (3 ) The Mysteries [24]. Adam Weishaupt's plan for world take-ove r was to operate under cover as long as possible,"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"and when the gullible world fina lly found out it would be too la te to stop them. The Illuminati was to be a Secret Society within the Secret Society of the Freemas ons. And, to stay hidden from the vast population, Adam Weishaupt and hi s co-conspirators selected for themselves code names, such as Spartacus for Weisha upt, Von Knigge became Philo, and Herr Von Zwack was called Cato [25]. The Illuminati also tried to hide their lo cation as they traveled in different countries spreading their poison. They did this by usi ng code names to communi cate where they were. For instance, Ingolstadt, Germany, where th eir organization originated, was given the fictitious name of Eleusis; Austria was Egypt, Munich was called Athens, and Vienna was Rome. The Illuminati invented its own calendar and the names of the months were also given code names, such as Dimeh for Janua ry, and Bemeh for February [26]. Because of Martin Luther's rejection of the Roman Catholic Church in 1517, and the corruption and strife within the Roman Catholic Church itself, the Papacy lost a great deal o f its authority to dictate to the world. Before Adam Weishaupt form ed his Order of Illuminati in 1776, Free Thinking or the Encycl opedists, were already pre aching a philosophy against the tyranny and fanaticism of the Roman Catholic Church. One such voi ce heard in the thir d quarter of the 18th century was a French author, philos opher and apostle of Free Thought (Liberty) named Voltaire (1694-1778). Even t hough the Roman Catholic Church lost much o f its power before 1798 when Pope Plus VI was dethroned [27], Vo ltaire still lived in an age when the press did not exist, thought was not fr ee; and men were not equal before the Civil Law. Although professing belief in a Supreme Being, or a god, he denied the existence of Jesus Christ and the authority of th e Bible [28]. He became a staunc h opposer of papal Christianity and helped to promote the Encyclopedis ou Di ctionnaire Raisonne des Sciences, des Arts et des Metier (28 vols. 1751-1772; Supplement 5 vol s. 1776-7 table analytique, 2 vols. 1780), to which he was a contributor, and which is known to us today as the Encyclopedia. Like Weishaupt, Voltaire, w hose real name was jean Franco is Arouet [29], was educated by the Jesuits, but later turned against Catholicism and he lped promote the philosophy o f Enlightenment (Illuminism) to combat papal Ch ristianity. From the Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, Baldwin, we will read where the philosophy of the Encyclopedists and that of the Illuminists became fused into the sa me movement working to cause the French Revolution: \"For the Encyclopedia was more than a great dictionary of sc iences, arts, and trades; it was conceived in the spirit OF THE ILLU MINATION MOVEMENT, and it carried the PRINCIPLES, AS WELL AS THE RESULTS , OF THE NEW TH INKING INTO THE CULTURE OF THE TIME, THUS IT BECAME AT ONCE A STOREHOUSE OF INFORMATION AND A REVO LUTIONARY FORCE.\" Dict ionary of Philosophy an d Psychology, Baldwin, The Macmillan Company, p. 322. There was an army of writers used by Lucife r in the 18th century to poison the minds of the French people against Christianity as a whol e nation. Voltaire once boastingly said: \"I am weary of hearing people repeat that twelve men establishe d the Christian religion. I will PROVE that one man may suff ice to overthrow it\" [30]. Actually the ideas of the Enlightenment (i lluminati) was a continua tion of the Renaissance, that was borrowed from the Greek philosopher Plato (427-347 BC). Weish aupt's idealism was b orrowed also from such writers in the 17th century as Descartes and Bayle in France, Grotius in Holland, Leibnitz in Germany, Locks in England [31]. In the early 18th century, writers such as Newton and Hume in England, Diderot, an d D'Alembert, like Voltaire, ca n all be credited with cont ributing to this philosophical movement which led to the founding of this Secr et Revolutionary Society called the illuminati [32]. In the United States, Benjamin Franklin, who knew Voltaire, was a leading figure in the Enlightenment. And, ironically enough, the ideas of this movement formed the background to"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"the Declaration of independenc e. It was our Lord, however, that took this confusion an d molded it into a protective shield against both civil and religious persecution, Now coming back to the prophecy about th e illuminati making avow ed war on the Bible (Two Witnesses), we read in Revelation 11:9-12: \"And they of the people and kindreds an d tongues and nations shall see their dead bodie s three days and on half, and shall not suffe r their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice ove r them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. And after THREE DAYS AND AN HALF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE FROM GOD en tered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.\" There may have been ma ny minor reasons why France beca me a habitation of Atheists during the French Revolution with its 3.1/2 year \"Reign of Terror,\" howe ver, it actually began b ecause of Roman Catholic suppre ssion of the Scriptures. Christ was not preached as set forth in the Gospel. It was just the opposite. Jesus was misrepresented among the vast multitudes in France, which led to Christianity being pr ohibited by state law. Because of the false p resentation of the Gospel by the Papacy, the suppression of the Scriptures, the tyranny an d fanaticism of the Papacy, an ar my of atheists was able to ga in sympathy for their cause, an d the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomle ss pit was able to make war on the Bible (Two Witnesses) and overcome it. Here we find the reason the Papacy lost its dictatorial power. This set the stage for not only destroying Christiani ty in France at that era of time, but also set the stage for the forces of France to march into Vatican City and dethrone the Pope when N apoleon came on the scene after the Revolution. Writers have hailed the Fr ench Revolution as the dawning of a new era, but it actually was the birth of another terrible deception of the Seven Headed Dragon (Lucifer) to destroy millions of human lives. When Lucifer saw that the Papacy's power was coming to an end as p redicted in Daniel 7:25, he simply raised up another movement to destroy man that woul d continue until the Papacy's power is restored as predicted in Revelation 13:3 which we will later study. Now, the Illuminati movement that shal l make war on the Lamb (but the Lamb shall overcome them, Revelation 17:14) is not to become world wide until the second beast o f Revelation 13:11-17 begins to em erge and speak as a dragon. This , as we will learn later, is the power of Apostate Protestantism in America. But before we can understand how illuminism, Catholicism, and Ap ostate Protestantism shall go forth into the world to unite them against the Real Jesus of the Bible, we need to know what name the Illuminati are operating under today. As stated before, Adam Weishaupt connec ted with the Masonic Lodge in 1777. He posed at first among the Freemasons as a reformer in religion and a liberal in politics. Because Freemasonry was also anti-papal, Weishaupt's anti-papacy policies in Germany became p opular immediately. Weishaupt enrolled no less than two thousand names upon the Illuminati registers in Germany. Among those were some of the most distinguished aristocrats of that Country [33]. It is quite apparent that the men of th e Order of Freemasonry that joined Weishaupt's Illuminati, had no idea of what trap they ha d fallen into. Very few Masons understood what Adam Weishaupt's plans were in the beginni ng, as very few Masons today understand what their own organization teaches. Weishaupt pene trated into the Freem asonry organization with all the shrewdness and subtlety that he learned from once being a Jesuit priest. Some historians have writ ten that the French Revolution was not premeditated. Some will say that the French Revolution emerged only from a pol itical crisis that coincided with an economic breakdown. This economic breakdown ge nerated unrest and riots which even the French army could not quell. It was this, some historian will argue, that made the people o f"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"France determined to cause a social change, and overthrow their country. What these historians say is true in part only. The pa rts of history some hi storians fail to see, or leave out, is actually what caused the peopl e in the first place to accept this spirit (o f Illuminism). As stated before , it was the suppression of the Bible, the fanatical oppression o f the Roman Catholic Church, that actually generated the spark that eventually led the French p eople to reject Christia nity and publicly burn th eir Bibles. History records that the events that led up to the French Revolution were caused by anarchy. The citizens became divided into a medley of hate factions that were struggling for power, trying to exterminate each other [34]. But before this it was the Roman Catholic Church, who slaughtered French citizens by thousands, that kindled a hatred for Christiani ty. The murderous charac ter of the Papacy was seen in France. In 1572 AD Roman Catholics tried in one sweep to murder all of the Protestants in France. This is known in histor y as the St. Bartholomew Massacre. Within the space of one month, 60000 Protestants are said to have been slain in France. All told there were over 75000. The Cardinal of Lorraine gave 1000 crowns as a reward to the person who brought the news to the Vatican [35]. Here the reader may unders tand more clearly Revelation 11: 8, \"where also our Lord was crucified.\" \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" Matthew 25:40. When the Papacy killed the Protestants in the streets of Paris, they also were destroying the Temple that Jesus dwelt in, and saith th e Lord: \"YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME.\" During the Revolution, France wa s reduced to a state of moral debasement similar to that o f the city of Sodom in Lot's time. She also had the same spirit of Atheism wi thin her as did the Pharoah of Egypt in Moses' day. Both the sins of Sodom (licentiousness) and of Egypt (Atheism) France wa s predicted to have in Revelation 11 :7,8. At the closing of the 1260 years the Two Witnesses (Old and New Testaments) were to finish their testimony [36]. And it was from here that illuminism be gan to emerge and overcome Ch ristianity. History calls this movement of Illuminism (Athei sm) \"The Jacobi n CIubs\" [37]. The Jacobin Clubs in Fran ce were the aristocratic terro rists who spearheaded the French Revolution, which sent King L ouis XVI, on January 21st, 1793, to the guillotine. However, most historians leave out who was really giving orders to Danton, Marat, and Robespierre, the leaders of the Jacobin Clubs. It was the Jacobi n Clubs that actually abolished Christianity through the National Assembly, and established the worshi p of the goddess of Reason, o r Liberty. The name \"Jacobin\" derived from the name of the convent these aristocratic terrorists use d to secretly plot the overthrow of King Louis XVI. The convent was called Jacobin Dominican Convent [38]. They were also known as the Society of the Friends of the Constitution, an d were soon organized in every important town in France. They were the most wealthy an d influential people in France. They had as many as 500,000 memb ers at the height of the influence in 1793-1794 [38]. The truth is, this aristr ocratic terrorist movement calle d the Jacobin Club was actually French illuminists operati ng under a different name. As established earlier, Adam Weishaupt became a Mason in 1777 for the sole purpose o f using that organization as a t ool for boring into the high le vels of government by simply replacing Freemasons who already sat in these positions. With an inexhaustible talent for charla tanry, and a well planne d system of espionage, Weishaupt's disciples infiltrate d into the high levels of the governments in Germany, France, England, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Hungary, and Italy. However, it was Baron Von Knigge who joined the Illuminati in 1780 that ga ve this organization its rapi d expansion, not Adam Weishaupt. Freemasons, like all Secret Societies, choose to remain ob scure and do not like to attract attention. Because the Illumina ti was a Secret Society wi thin the Secret Society o f"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Freeemasonry, even though they had penetrated into the high le vels of Europe, very few indeed ever heard of them. Ho wever, shortly before the Revol ution took place in France, two hard blows would land on the heads of Adam Weishaupt and his co-conspirators. The Freemasons were not long in hearing rumors about the true nature of Weishaupt's plans to capture their whole organizati on. When the Freemasons began to get wind of Wei shaupt's true p urposes, a chief council was held to examine the nature of the Il luminati by top ranking Freemasons. A conference of Ma sons was held in 1782 at wh ich time Weishaupt and Von Knigge attended [40]. But it wasn't until Weisha upt and Von Knigge had a falling out that le d to Von Knigge leaving the Orde r, that Weishaupt began to have exposure and a threat o f internal strife with in the illuminati. A contest between Weishaup t and Von Knigge about who was to be the Rex or King of this Secret revolutionary movement was the real motive for Von Knigge leaving it. After Von Knigge left the Illuminati, the hardest blow to Weishaupt's Luciferian Conspiracy was received in 1785. One of Weishaupt's coconspi rators, named Lanze, was struck by lightning while en route from Frankfurt, Germany to deli ver documents to Robesp ierre, the head of the Jacobin Clubs at that time. The documents that Lanze was carrying had important information about the Order of the Illumina ti, and its plans of not only de stroying the French government through riots and revolutions, but also governments of the world as well [41]. This is how we today have information about this beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit. All of the p apers Lanze was carrying fell into the hands of the Bavarian Governme nt, and the authorities ordered the police to raid the headquarters of the Illuminati in Germany. Adam Weishaupt ha d to escape for his life [42] and all documentive evidence that th e Order of the illuminati was a dangerous international terrorist group was br ought to the attention of many countries in Europe. However, the warnings fe ll on deaf ears, as they will in our day. When the Word o f God was rejected, and spiritualism took its place, France fell into a degrad ing worship of the goddess of Reason. This period of time in history is also known as the Age of Reason, or the Reign of Terror. And interesti ngly enough, the Reign of Terror la sted 3.1/2 years, as predicte d in Revelation 11:11: \"After three days and a half (prophetic year s) the Spirit of life from Go d entered into them, (Old and New Testaments), and they stood upon their feet.\" The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit was a politi cal power that ascended out o f Witchcraft, made open, avowed war on the Bible and Christianity, caused the French Revolution, and is predicted in Scripture to continue from the French Revolution, an d eventually spread to every co rner of the habitable globe. To point out how the same rebellious spir it of Nimrod and how his hatred towards the Lor d of the Sabbath could be seen also in the Illu minati of the 18th cent ury, Uriah Smith, in his b ook Daniel and the Revelation p. 285, quotes a priest of Illumi nism that was a well known comedian in France at that time: \"God! if you exist, ... ave nge your injured name. I bid you defiance. You remain silent; you dare not launch your thunders; w ho, after this, will believe in your existence?\" Daniel and th e Revelotion, Smith, Southern Publishing Association, 1944, p. 285. In the next chapter we will continue to show this gr adual Luciferian Conspiracy to overthrow Christianity and all governments of the world symboli zed in Scripture as the beast that ascendeth out of the botto mless pit (Illuminati), and how it can be traced through various names and guises starting from the Fr ench Revolution, to our present day. The anarchy that was displa yed in the streets of Paris thro ugh the efforts of this Antichrist movement will be seen in this country. El len White, in her book Education, p. 228, saw this anarchy was soon to become a worl d-wide Conspiracy. She states: \"At the same time anarchy is seeking to sweep away all la w, not only divine, but human.

Jacobin Clubs, The League of the Just, The League of the Communists and Bolshevism were all Illuminati fronts. 6. The plan by the modern 20th Century Illuminists to get control of the World's Nuclear Weapons through the United Nations. In 1785, the Bavarian Government exposed Adam Weishaupt's plan to destroy Christianity and control governments. However, this was not the end of the Illuminati, as most historians have written. Weishaupt's plans were only interrupted and dealt with as a dangerous revolutionary force in Germany. The other nations that the Illu minati were operating in did not heed the warning from the Bavarian Government . Just a couple of year s later, the plan to destroy Christianity and Worl d Governments was first seen in the French Revolution. This same revolutionary force reappeared again in Germany, called \"The Lea gue of the Just\" [1], with branches in London, Brussels, Paris, and Switzerland. Napoleon, when he came into power, would not tolerate the activitie s of the Jacobin Clubs with their independent opposition, so he complete ly suppressed it [2]. However, the Illuminati j ust operated under other na mes. It was under the name of \"The League of the Just\" that \"Karl Marx\" became a member. He was hired to update the writings of Adam Weishaupt, written seventy years earlier. Weishaupt died in 1830, but his revolutionary plans were carried on by a list of his successors. In 1842 Karl Marx began to write revolutionary propaganda for the League of the Just, hoping to cause a spirit of unre st. In 1844, in collaboration with Friedrich Engels, and unde r the supervision of The League of the Just, Ma rx began to write the infamous \"Manifest de r Kommunistichen Partei,\" comm only known today as the \"The Communist Manifesto,\" which appeared at the beginni ng of 1848 [3]. Later, the Illuminati operating under th e name of The League of the Just, changed their name to \"The League of Communists\" [4]. The Communists celebrate May 1st as the bi rth of their revolutiona ry movement because it was the birthday of the Illumi nati, founded by Adam Weishaupt. And, it is not by chance that all Communists use the \"Pentagram\" (five pointed star) as one of their insigia. And, it is not b y chance that the Communists use the term RE D to describe their revolutionary movement. The Rothschild international ba nking family, who for some 200 years had a great influence on the economic and the political history of Europe, was founde d by Mayer Amschel Rothschil d Feb. 23, 1744 in Frankfurt.

Revelation 17:3, 8. In the 1890's this world re volutionary movement added to its membership Vladimar Ilyich Ulyanov, who changed his name to Nicholai Lenin. As the il luminati terroris t group in France (Jacobin Clubs) caused the fall of the government of Louis XVI, so did their later aristocractic b rethren operating under the name of Bolshevism [6] cause th e overthrow of the Tsar in Russia and cause the Russian Revolution in 1917 [7]. It will be s hown later that these Communists were financed by both European and American International Bankers. The ideas Lenin developed were directly fr om the Karl Marx Communist Manifesto, and the ideas founded in the Communist Manifesto were directly from the writings of Dr Adam Weishaupt, who took his orders fr om the House of Rothschild. Gary Allan in his multimillion b est seller None Dare Call It Conspiracy, stat es the following about Marx's Communist Manifesto: \"If you study Marx Communi st Manifesto you will find that in essence Marx said the p roletarian revolution would establ ish the Socialist dictatorship of the proletariat. To achieve the Socialist dictatorship of the proletariat, three thi ngs would have to be accomplished. 1. The elimination of all right to private property. 2. The dissoluti on of the family unit: and 3. Destruction of what Marx re ferred to as the 'opiate of the people,' 'Religion.' \" Allan goes on to say, \"Kar l Marx was hired by a mysteri ous group who called themselves 'The League of the Just Men' to write the Communist Manifesto as demagogic boob- b ait to appeal to the mob. In actualfa ct the Communist Manifesto was in circulation for many years b efore Marx' name was widely enough recognized to establ ish his authorship for this revolutionary handbook. All Karl Marx really did was update and codify the very same revolutionary plans and principles set down seventy years earlier by Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Order of the Illu minati in Bavaria. And, it is widely acknowledged by serious scholars of this subject that the League of the Just Men wa s simply an extension of the Illuminati which was forced to go underg round after it was exposed by a raid in 1786 conducted by the Bavarian author ities.\" None Dare Call It C onspiracy, Allan, Concord Press, 1971, p. 25. Even though Allan dates the e xposure of the illuminati at a nother year than what we rea d from a Masonic book, nevertheless, it does not alter the fact that these things ar e historically true. Marx also called for the abolition of Capitalism, which he believed was a struggle between the bourgeoisie (the middle class) and the proletariat (the workers) [8]. Marxism tells the poor that if they would es tablish a dictatorship of the proletariat, which would set up a classless Communi st society, everyone would liv e in peace, prosperity, an d freedom. There would be no more need for governments, police, or armies, and all these would gradually wither away [9]. Marx said th at the ruling class would never willingly give up its power, and that struggle and viol ence were therefore inevitable [10]. This would naturally sound te rrific to some poor struggling black s, or to the starving in the Latin American countries. But what the Communi st leaders don't tell the people is that the leaders are exempt from sharing equally th e material wealth of their nation. How many Russian leaders do you see among the poverty stricken? The real mo tive behind Communism is not to distribute the wealth of the world equally, but the Communist Part y is just a front fo r the super-rich as an instrument for gaini ng and using power. IT IS NOT THE COMMUNISTS THAT RUN COMMUNISM. There is yet anot her controling powe r behind communism. Communism and socialism are just arms of a more devilish conspira cy working behind the p ublic eye, that is not bei ng run from Moscow or Peking, but from New York, Paris an d London. These are very serious and dangerous time s. The average gullible American has absolutely no thought what is about to co me upon him. Awake! Awake!

This beast from the bottomless pi t (Spiritualism) spread its poi son first in Europe during the French Revolution, and from there to Russia. George Washington, even though he was a deceived Freemason, was neve rtheless a loyal American, and was very aware of this International Revolutionary force to destroy all governments and religi ons in his own time. Des Griffin in his book Fourth Reich of th e Rich, p. 57 explains how the Illuminati Conspiracy crept into America even when the 13 original Colonies were united: \"However, before the Colonies were united, the Constitution adopted, and our Republic established, fifteen Lodges of the Order of the IIluminat i were formed in th e thirteen Colonies. The Columbia Lodge of the Order of the IIlu minati was established in New York City in 1785: members included Governor DeWitt Cl inton, and later CLINTON ROOSEVELT (a direct ancestor of FDR), Charles Dana and Ho race Greeley. The following year a Lodge was established in Virginia with which was identified THOMAS JEFFERSON. When Weishaupt's diabolical plans were exposed by the Bavarian government, JEFFERSON STRONGLY DEFENDED HIM AS AN 'ENTHUSI ASTIC PHILANTHROPIST.\" \"Many strong warnings were issued about the activities of the Illuminati in America. On July 19th, 1798, David Pappen, President of Harv ard University, issued a strong warning to the graduating class and lect ured them to the influenc e Illuminism was having on the American scene. President Timothy Dwight of Yale University issued a similar warning. \"Also GEORGE WASHINGTON sent a letter to a G.W Snyder in which he stated: 'It is not my intention to doubt that the doctrine of the Il luminati and the principles of Jacobinism ha d not spread to the United States. On the contrary, no one is more satisfied of this fact than I am. \"The idea I meant to convey was that I did believe the Lodges of Freemasonry in this country had as societies, endeavored to propagate the diabolical tenets.\" Fourth Reich of the Rich, Griffin, Emissary Publications, 1979. Russia is a perfect example today of what the illuminati plans are for the world. There are about 1.1/3 billion persons, or about a third of the worl d's population, who now live unde r Communist rule. However, it is estimated that only 10% of th e people are actually members o f the Communist Party themselves [11]. Look at Russia today and it s Communist brethren worldwide. The Communist Party allow no politic al rivals, and the voters have no real choice among candidates. The truth is that the Co mmunist Party itself is a highly centralize d government, and only its top members make impor tant decisions. Most Communist countries are nothing less than open air concentration camps . And, contrary to Marx's predictions, thei r conflicts, crime and pr ejudices have not vanished in thes e Communist countries. There is just as much centralization of the w ealth of a nation for the gain of a few, at the expense of the p oor and middle class, in Communi st countries as there is in non-Communist countries. There can also be seen in Communist countries the same national and raci al hatred they were supposed to be free of. Who are really pulling the strings today behind the Communist World Revolutionary movement? Gary Allan's statement in his book, N one Dare Call It Conspiracy, could not state it any plainer, on page 35: \" 'Communism' is not a movement of th e down-trodden masses but is a movement created, manipulated and used by power-seek ing billionaires in order to gain control over the world ... first by establishing socialist governments in the various nations and then consolidating them all through a 'Great Merger,' into an ALL POWERFUL WORLD SOCIALIST SUPERSTATE p robably under the auspices of the UNITED NATIONS.\" None Dare Call It Conspiracy, Allan, Concord Press, 1971. It is the International Banke rs who are actually pul ling the strings that control the affairs o f Communism, not the Communists.

They first used the Masonic Lodges as we learned earlier, to begin this ta sk. By sitting in the top seats of all governments, the Illuminati agents could eventually guide the nations to ward a \"Novus Ordo Seclorum,\" which means in Latin \"A New World Order.\" They would accomplish this by th e power of the vote which they would have while occupying positions as legislators. However, before the people of the world would accept the Luciferian Government which Weishaupt, an apostle of Lucife r, hoped to eventually achieve, there would have to be a culture change within the societies of the people first, along with a spirit of unrest and riots in the air. The people of the world would have to be reduced into a godless society. Atheism was j ust a tool to destroy Christianity in Fran ce during the Revolution. Weishaupt and his \"Inne r Circle\" were not ATHEISTS; they believed in a god. However, this god was not Jesus Christ, but Lucifer. Communism is just an anti-Christian, atheistic fo rce to destroy Christianity an d all world governments, by modern day Lucife rians who actually c ontrol world commerce. Saith the Lord: \"For all nations have drunk of the wine of her fo rnication, and the kings of the earth have committed forni cation with her, and the ME RCHANTS OF THE EARTH are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacie s. How much she hath glorified herself, an d lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall he r plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who iudgeth her. And the MERCHA NTS OF THE EARTH shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their mercha ndise any more.\" Revelation 18:3, 7, 11. For the benefit of any skeptic, or reader who has been brainwashed into believing that this Luciferian (illuminati-Communist-Socialistic) Conspiracy does not ex ist today, let us loo k into a warning from Winston Churchill that he wrote February 8, 1920, in the Illustrate d Sunday Herald: \"From the days of SPARTICUS (Adam Weisha upt) to Karl Marx, to those of Trotsky, Bela- Kuhn, Rose Luxembourg, and Emma Goldman, this world-wi de conspiracy has been STEADILY growing. This conspiracy has played A DEFINITELY RECOGNIZABLE ROLE IN THE TRAGEDY OF THE FR ENCH REVOLUTION. It ha s been the mainspring o f EVERY SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENT DURING THE 19TH CENTURY; and now at last, this band of extraordinary personalities from th e underworld of the great cities of Europe an d America have gripped the Russ ian people by the hair of th eir heads, and have become p ractically the undisputed ma sters of that enormous empi re.\" Quoted from The Missing Dimension in World Affairs, Goy, p. 92. Revelation 16:13,14 warns about the three-fold union of the Dragon, the Beast and the False Prophet that will unite the w hole world whose names are not written in the Lamb's book o f Life, to war against Christ and His people. The first power that will go out into the world is symbolized as the Dragon, Revelation 16:13. It is also symbolized as th e Beast that Ascendeth out of the Bottomless Pit. These TWO symbols both repres ent Satan and his Luciferian (Illuminati-Communism-Socialistic) Conspiracy. Like the 18th century Illuminists of the French Revolution, the New Age Movement (Spiritualism of Today) is seeking to de stroy Christianity by a worldwide social transformation. Among this New Age Movement there are teachers and office workers, famous scientists, government of ficials and lawmakers, artists and millionaires, taxi drivers and celebrities, leaders in medicine, education, law, and psychology, who are trying to condition the Christian world into accepting this modern version of Nimrod's One Worl d Government. Marilyn Ferguson, the aut hor of The Aquarian Conspiracy who is a member of this Luciferian plot herself, states the following in her book on page 26: \"The Aquarian Conspiracy represents the Now What. We have to move into the unknown:"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The known has failed us too completely. \"Taking a broader view of history and a deeper measure of nature, The Aquarian Conspiracy is a different kind of Revolution, with different revolutiona ries.

As we learned earlier, Co mmunism derived out of an 18t h century version of Babylonian Witchcraft (Illuminism), and it insisted on the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Francis B. Randall, Ph.D., who has taught at both Amherst College and Columbia University, states the following about Marx in his book, The Comm unist Manifesto, on page 37: \"He (Marx) insisted on th e forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions with uninhibited abandon ... Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The p roletarians have nothing to lose but their chai ns. They have a world to win. Working men o f all countries, unite! Millions have thrilled to this most memorable of all appeals that have come down to us from the Romantic Age.\" The Communist Manifesto, Marx/Engels, edite d by Francis B. Randall, Ph.D ., Simon & Schuster, 1964. As we tried to show the reader before , Communism is not a m ovement to help the downtrodden people of the world. But Communism is actually being run today by Capitalists, the very people who control the wealth of the world that Communism is supposedly fighting against. Very few Americans know that Karl Marx was a correspondent and political analyst for Horace Greeley, who owne d the New York Times news paper. In 1849 both Horace Greeley and Clinton Roosevelt c ontributed financially to the Communist League in London to assist in the publication of the Communist Manifesto [12]. Other contributors were the English millionaire, Cowell Stepney, and of course Friedrich Engels, who was a wealthy German. And, up until recently, two checks ma de out to Karl Marx by Nathan Rothschil d could be seen on display at th e British Museum. Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin were financed by Capitalists from America, Engl and and Germany, to help prom ote the Bolsheviki Revolution in Russia. What should a follower of Jesus of Nazareth do? Should we unite together and take up arms and defend ourselves? The answer is NO, a thousand times NO. This conflict is not a social, b ut a spiritual war. \"For we wrestle not against flesh and bl ood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, AGAINST SPIRITUAL WICKEDNESS IN HIGH PLAC ES.\" Ephesians 6:12. It is foretold that Lucifer will condition the ignorant of this world into accepting a total Luciferian Rule through Spiritualism, Catholicis m, and Apostate Protesta ntism. In the name o f Peace and Love does this great delusion come. \"And with all deceivableness o f unrighteousness in them that peri sh; because they received not th e love of this truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shal l send them strong delu sion that they shoul d b elieve a lie: That they all mi ght be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\" 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12. The modern Luciferian One World Gove rnment plot to ensl ave the whole world unde r socialism is attackng the world by using phys ical force (Communism) and by subliminal warfare coming in the name of the New Age M ovement. This is nothing less than a mask fo r the super-rich who are really th e ruling class and those who cont rol the huge secret Society o f the Illuminati. The first Russian Marxist group was formed in 1883 in the very year of Marx's death by Lenin, who was a Russian Revolutionary exiled in Switzerla nd. Between 1900 and 1903 Lenin called his revoluti onaries the \"Bolsheviki, then la ter renamed themselves\" Communists, after Marx's term in the Communist Manifesto [13]. Lenin announced to the world before the ove rthrow of the Tsar in Russia the following:"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"\"After Russia we will take Easter n Europe, then the masses of Asia, then we will encircle the United States which will be the last bastion of capita lism. We will not have to attack. It will fall like an overripe fruit into our hands\" [14]. Since that statement Russia, China, Mongolia, Tibet, Afghani stan, Algeria, Ethiopia, Libya, N orth Korea, North and South Vietnam, C zechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Romania, Yugoslavia, Albania, Cuba, Chile, etc, are under Co mmunist rule; and now Central America and Mexico are threaten ed with Communist guerrillas. However, the Communist pl an to overthrow the last bast ion of capitalism (The Unite d States) is to be attacked politically, socially and economically, as Le nin planned. Robert L. Preston, in his book Wake Up America, states the following: \"When Nikita Khrushchev visited the United States, he boasted that the Communists woul d b ury us and that our grandchild ren would live unde r Communist rule. He even outlined the exact manner in which they would accomplish it: \"You Americans are so gullible. No, you wo n't accept Communism outright, but we'll keep feeding you small doses of Soci alism until you'll finally wa ke up and find you already have Communism. We won't have to fi ght you. We'll so weaken your economy until you'll fall like overripe fruit into our hands.\" \"As outlined by Khrushchev and Lenin, there is no intention for the Communist to attack us in battle; they expect us to fall into their ha nds like overripe fruit. They intend to bring this about by weakening our economic st ructure until we are financia lly insolvent and by giving us more and more Socialism until we are too weak to resist th e final thrust into complete Communist rule. As we review the Socialistic and economic pict ure in this nation today, we are forced to admit that they have once ag ain proceeded exactly as planned.\" Wake-Up America, Hawkes publishing Inc., 3775 S outh 500 W., Salt Lake City, Utah 84115. Preston goes on to quote in his book on page 18, the second point Kh rushchev made that was to cause the overthrow of the United States. \"The best way to destroy the Capitalist System is to deba uch the currency. By a continuing p rocess of inflation, gove rnments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of th eir citizens.\" Wake-U p America, pp. 15-17. There shall be wars and ru mors of wars until Jesus returns. However, the world and man will not be destroyed by a world wide nuclear holocaust. The Bible makes this very clear. God's people are here and will be delivered out of this wo rld at Christ's Second Coming. 1.Thessalonians 4:16. It will be Jesus who will lay this world in complete ruins, not the Communists. The threat of a wo rld-wide nuclear war is nothi ng less than another Communis t p lot to frighten the inhabitants of the world into believing that a One World Government is the only solution for world peace. Th e reader must understand that Communism is not being run from Moscow, but by those who control the monetary systems of the world in London, Paris and New York. Do you really believe they would blow up each other? As stated before, when Adam Weishaupt and the House of Rothsc hild formed their New Order for the Ages, or The Illuminati, they infi ltrated the high levels of the nations in Europe through Freemasonry. Through this th ey hoped to be able to fill the top positions in the Ol d World Governments so they coul d legislate bills that would connect the countries according to their plans. Using social issues and humanitaria n causes, the Illuminati of today have in thei r ranks untold millions promoting this same Luciferic scheme, and many in it are completely unawares. Millions upon millions of sincere pe ople think they are do ing the world a great service by joining this international Luciferian movement that's coming under a name today called \"The New Age Movement.\" Constance Cumbey, a Christian lawyer, got wind of this movement and spent painstaking months gathering New Age books a nd magazines, so she could expos e it for what it really is. She states in her book, The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow, The New Age Movement An d Our Coming Age Of Barbarism, that the Ne w Age Movement uses secret code names an d"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"symbols today, as we showed you earlier. One of the most impor tant symbols in this modern day Luciferian Conspiracy is, however, the ra inbow. Also called the Antahkarama, it is use d in the occult as an hypnotic device. This modern version of the Illumina ti calls the rainbow the \"International Sign of Peace.\" But to the higher orders of this movement, it represents in symbolic language that they are building a rainbow bridge between the personality (man) an d the over-soul, or the Great Un iversal Mind. This Great Univer sal Mind is Sanat Kumara, o r Lucifer [15]. New Agers display this rai nbow symbol on their cars and businesses. After carefully investigating the publis hing houses and organizations that are today p romoting this modern day version of Ad am Weishaupt's World Revolution, Attorney Constance Chumbey has compiled documentive pr oof that the New Age Movement has now a network of more than 10000 different organizati ons they are working through, just in the United States and Canada [16]. The modern day Luciferian Conspiracy to overthrow Christia nity and all other religions that will not worship Lucifer is today called THE PLAN . It was Adam Weis haupt in the 18th century who first wrote out this Plan for a One World Luciferi an Government. Then, 70 years later it was updated by Karl Ma rx in the 19th century. Howeve r, it was Alice Bailey whom Lucifer used to speak to the 20th century man. Alice Bailey died in 1949 leaving behind a step b y step plan to destroy Chri stianity and all ot her religions and governments who will not adhere to this New Age M ovement. Attorney Constanc e Chumbey points out in her book, The Hidden Dangers Of The Rainbow, how Alic e Bailey, in The Externalisation of the Hierarcy, told New Agers to feel free to use we apons on religious groups who interfere in the p olitical process of their movement. The Ne w Age Movement plans to eliminate several b illions of people from the eart h's population. They say this must be done before the year 2000 if the world is to survive [17]. The weapons that they plan to use are NUCLEAR BOMBS, gained through the promotion o f a nuclear freeze and disarmament. The countries of the world ar e to be pressured into giving up these nuclear weapons and they are to be placed into the hands of the United Nations so they can police the world. On page 548 of her book, Alice Bailey is quoted as follows: \"As a means in the hands of the United Nati ons to enforce the outer forms of peace, and thus give time for teaching on peac e and on the growth of goodwill to take effect. The atomic b omb does not belong to the three nations who perfected it and w ho own the secrets at present - the United States of America, Great Britain and Canada. It belongs to the United Nations fo r use (or rather let us hope, simply for threatened use) when aggressive act ion on the part of any nation rears its ugly head.\" The Extern alisation of the Hierarcy, Bailey. The most dangerous threat for Freedom and Christianity fr om these modern Luciferians is coming today under the guise of WORLD PEACE. To take control of the wo rld, these conspirators had to ge t control of the world monetary systems through a Central Bank wh ich we shall discover they have already achieved. Now they are working night and day to condition the world governments into handing over the weapons to them and place th em in the very hands of t hose who want this One Worl d Luciferian Government. Coming in the name of Nuclear Freeze for Peace, or Nuclea r Disarmament, it has been their greatest task to get their hands on these nuclear weapons. Alice Bailey, whom these modern Luciferians follow to the letter, states the following in her book, The Externalisation of the Hierarchy: \"In the preparatory period for the new wo rld order there will be a steady and regulate d disarmament. It will not be optional. No nati on will be permitted to produce and organise any equiptment for destructive purposes or to infri nge the security of any nation. One of the first tasks of any future peace confer ence will be to regulate this ma tter and gradually see to the disarming of the nations.\" This 20th Century Luciferian prophetess told her disciples that the nations of the 20th century will eventually hand ove r their nuclear weapons to th e United Nations.

In Revelation 13:5, we see again how this \"First Beast\" identifies with Daniel 's prediction of the Papacy in Daniel 7:24, 25. Daniel stated the \"Little Horn\" would speak \"great words ag ainst the Most High.\" And so did the Ap ostle John predict this, and another unmistakabl e fact that clearly shows us this \"First Beast\" is the Papacy: \"And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue FORTY AND TWO MONTHS.\" Here we see again this 1260 years of Papal rule. As we have already examined, 42 months in Bible prophecy equals 1260 years. Now in Re velation 13:11-17 we are shown a third partly religious and partly political power emerging in history around the time the Papacy lost its p ower to control Europe. We are sad to say it , but this \"Second Beast\" here in Revelation 13:11-17 is Protestant America. Th e United States is predicted from Scripture to be first a lamb-like nation; however, late r it is to speak as a dra gon, Revelation 13: 11. Let us now examine the 13th chapter of Revelation in more detail. Revelation the 13th chapter is divided into two parts. Vers es 1 through 10 are a prophecy o f not only the Papacy, but also the controlling powers of the known world in the ancient past that promoted the various astrol ogical religions that originally derived out of the Babylonian worship of Nimrod, Cush and Semiramis. If the reader will examine closely the \"F irst Beast\" of Revelati on 13:1-10 and compare it with Daniel 7:3-8, he will see how similar th e two visions are. Daniel 7:3-8 is the same p rophecy John the Apostle was gi ven almost 700 years later. Daniel saw these pagan Sun worshipping nations in sequence, while John saw the same prophecy in its full stage. Notice in Revelation 13:1,2 this First Beas t is made also from parts of the animals (beasts) we read o f"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"as described in Daniel's vi sion. \"And the beast which I saw was like unto a LEOPARD, an d his feet were as the feet of a BEAR, and his mouth as the mout h of a LION: and the DRAGON gave him HIS POWER, AND HIS SEAT, AND GREAT AUTHORITk:\" Revelation 13:2. The Apostle John was not only given the sa me vision as Daniel, but he was shown even more prophetic truths. The A postle John was shown Seven Heads among the Ten Horns, an d \"Another Beast\" that Daniel wasn 't shown. And John also saw that it is this First Beast that the \"Dragon (Satan) gave his power, seat, and gr eat authority.\" And, it is the Beast (Papacy) about which the book of Revelation warns that will have a Mark, and will have control o f commerce \"that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or th e name of the Beast, or the number (666, Rev. 13:18) of his name.\" However, it is not this first beast that will cause the whole world to receive its \"Mark\" or its name or its number, 666. It is this \"Second Beast\" (Rev. 13:11- 17) which is \"another beast\" that Daniel the prophet didn't see in his vision that will actuall y \"causeth the.earth and them which dwell therein to worship the First Be ast (Papacy), whose deadly wound was healed.\" As we pointed out in history, the Papacy's dictatorial rule was taken away by the French in 1798. And in Revelation 13:3 it was predicted: \"And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was he aled: and all the world wondered after the beast.\" The Papacy's power is predic ted from Scripture to be restored! \"And I saw three unclean sp irits like frogs come out of the mouth of the Dragon (Satan, Rev. 12: 9), and out of the mouth of the Beast, and out of the mouth of the False Prophet.\" Revelation 16:13. These three Sata nic powers are also symbolized in Revelation as three b easts (political powers), that arise from three different areas in the world. They are: The Beast that ascendeth out of the Bottomless Pit, Rev. 11:7, 17:3,8; · The B east that rises out o f the Sea, Rev. 13:1, 2; and · The Beast th at comes out of the Earth, Rev. 13:11-17. These three unclean spirits ar e predicted to perform such deceiving miracles that most of the inhabitants from the four corners of the world will believe this is the power of God. \"For they are the spirits of Devils, work ing miracles, which go forth unto th e kings of the earth and the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty\" Revelation 16:14. As we pointed out earlier, it will be Spirit ualism that will unite the whole world under a Luciferian Confederacy. And in our day Spiritualism will come in the name of The New Age Movement (Illuminati), Catholicism, a nd American Apostate Protestantism. Let us now examine by Bi ble prophecy and history that the Dragon and the Beast o f Revelation 16:13 are symbolized here as the I lluminati and the Papacy ; and let us see how it is, indeed, American Protestan tism who is the False Prophet. Like the Beast that ascend eth out of the Bottomless Pit (Ill uminati), America was foretold to emerge around the time the Two Witnesses (Old and New Test ament) were finishing thei r testimony (at the end of the 1260 years of Papa l rule). And, like the illuminati, Protestant America was born in the same year (1776). This will be unde rstood by examining Revelation the 13th chapter. Both the Papacy and Protesta nt America are foretold in Revelation 13:1-18. \"And I stood upon the sand of th e sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns te n crowns, and upon his heads the name o f b lasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unt o a leopard, and his feet were as the feet o f a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I saw one of his head s as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.

And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, w hose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth in to captivity shall go into captivi ty: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.\" Revelation 13:1-10. Revelation 13:1-10 shows the world ruling po litical powers Satan has used and is using to p romote Spiritualism. Some suggest that th e seven heads on the be ast of Revelation 13:1 represent Egypt, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Pagan Rome, Papal Ro me and the seventh head is the Papacy again, when its religious dictatorship is restored. However, most have forgotten about anot her kingdom that existed before Egypt became a nation. Shortly after the flood, th e first kingdom Satan used to promote Spiritualism was Babel. And it was at Babel that Nimrod attempted to unite the world in that day into a One World Government. Egypt was i ndeed a nation that promoted Witchcraft, but Egypt was never a World Ruling Power. Babel was, a nd it was in control of the known world about 2,000 years before King Nebuchadnezzar ruled the known world from Babylon. Babylon was b uilt on the ruins of Babel. So, the seven heads found on th e Beast of Revelation 13:1 coul d also be Babel, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Paga n Rome, Papal Rome and the Papacy again restored. Revelation 13:1-10 gives its reader a comple te picture from the post flood era up until the days of this present world history. From Ni mrod's Tower of Babel to the founding of the United States, history was laid out in 95 AD for the Apostle John to witness in vision. From the Tower of Babel and down through the centuries, our Lord showed the political p owers Satan would use to spr ead the worship of himself th rough Spiritualism. His worship b y man started at Ba bel and is predicted in Scripture to be promoted from the Vatican under a false system of Christianity. Th e Papacy will be, in the near future, the head of this New World Religion that will unite with al l Pagandom and Apostate Protestantism. Saith the Lord: \"And they worshipped the Dragon (Devil) which gave power unto the beast (Papacy): and they worshipped the beast, sayi ng, who is like unto the be ast? Who is able to make war with him?\" Revelation 13:4. During the 1260 years of Papa l Rule, Satan used Catholicism to get the known world to bow b efore him. However, shortly before the Papacy was to receive its deadly wound [Revelation 13:3], the United States was to begin its mission in history. Here in Re velation 13:11-17 is the p rophecy that predicted the pow er of American Protestantis m that would gradually become the Prophet that will lead al l the world again to accept the dictatorial rule of the Roman Catholic Church. \"And I beheld another beas t coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, an d causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly woun d was healed. And he doeth greet wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. And deceiveth them that dwel l on the earth by the means o f those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should ma ke an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, an d did live. And he had powe r to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast shoul d b e killed. And he causeth all, both small and gr eat, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.\" Revelation 13:11-17. While the Papacy was losing its power in the third quarter of th e 18th century, the Unite d States as an independent Protes tant Nation began to make its a ppearance in history. It was to emerge out of a wilderness symbolized in pr ophecy as Earth (Rev. 13:13). The United States"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"in the beginning was a haven for those Protes tant European people who were fortunate enough to escape the brut al Papal Inquisitions. Th e United States was set up to have both civil and religious freedom. However, sadly enough, the United States is predicted in Scripture to throw away its civil and religi ous freedoms and \"exerciseth all the power of the first beast (Papacy) before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwel l therein to worship the first b east (Papacy), whose deadly wound was healed.\" In other wo rds, the United States will combine religious laws with politics, as did the Papacy when it first ruled Europe. It will force religious laws that actually derived out of Sp iritualism, which the Papacy adopted from the Roman version of the religion of Astrology. The United States is predicted in Scriptur e to be the False Prophet that will herald the religious dictatorship of the Pope of Rome, and cause the whole worl d to accept the Mark o f the Beast (Papacy). Since we know now who th is third power is, fo und in Revelation 16:13, that shall go forth with the Dragon (Illumina ti) and the Beast (Papacy) unto the whole worl d to gather them together to battle of that great day of God Almighty, let us now examine how indeed conspirators have been working with in the United States government behind the scenes, within the high pl aces of our government and other ag encies, to lead our country as it is predicted. To comprehend how degraded our government is becoming, we need to see what the conspiracy of the Beast that ascendeth out of the Bottomle ss Pit (Illuminat i-Communistic- Socialistic) is working within our own country. As we examined earlier, Adam Weishaupt , founder of the Order of the Illuminati, was a witch, and taught his foll owers the power of Witchcraft as a weapon to use against those who would get in their way or tried to expose th em. The whole order was trained to accomplish their objectives in complete s ecrecy. Weishaupt himself even remained behind the scenes in his own revolutionary moveme nt. Only his top members kne w him. Using Witchcraft to b rainwash his new initiates in to becoming antiChristian, Weis haupt recruited indirectly an army of international terrorists and propagandists to win others to his movement and help in his struggle to overthrow A LL religions and ALL government s. He even had schools that were specially designed to teach Internationalism. Only a sele ct few were chosen to atten d these schools which were established in different parts of the world. Some of the training received in interna tionalism was the art of Subliminal Warfare. This takes in mind control, or mind sciences. As stated before, Weish aupt in early Illuminism hire d an army of writers to write propaganda literature against Pa pal Christianity. For some 20 years before the French Revolution, Weishaupt de graded the morals of the French people with Atheism and with the licentious philosophies of Sodomy. And so do we see this same attac k on the minds of men here in the 20th Century. Back in the late 1940's, maybe some of you who are old enough wi ll remember the great Communist plot that was uncovered in Holly wood, where the FBI and the House Committee on Un-American Activities expos ed over 300 of Hollywood's top stage and screen stars as card carrying Communists. Myron C. Fagan was a sc reen writer, producer and dir ector both in Hollywood and on Broadway. In 1945, at the urgent request of John T. Flynn, the au thor of The Roosevelt Myth, While We Slept, and The True Story of Pearl Harbor, Fa gan attended a meeting in Washington, DC, where he was shown a set of microfilms and record ings of the secret meeting at Yalta attended only by Franklin Roos evelt, Alger Hiss, Harry Hopkins and Stalin, Molotov and Vishinsky, when they hatched the plot to deliver the Ba lkans, Eastern Europe and Berlin to Stalin. As a result of that meeting, Myron Fagan made open and avowed war on this Illuminati-Communistic-Soc ialistic Conspiracy, and formed an anti-Communist society called the Cinema Educational Guild. As a result of the work to expose Communistic p ropaganda in Hollywood, radio and televisi on, in 1947 there was set up in Washington, DC the Congressional hearings that unmasked some of the most famous stars in Hollywood as"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"card carrying Communists. You may wonder why these so-called stars ar e allowed to continue to influence the movie screens with their presence. The answer to that is, they are working for these same international bankers who own the movie companies. As we conti nue, it will be shown that it is these same international ba nkers who control Russia, that are the same conspirators who control NBC, ABC, and CBS television networks, and many large newspapers, magazine companies, and the modern Order of the Illuminati! When the reader understa nds that our media are controll ed by these same international bankers, maybe he can see why the Communist activity in Hollywood is alive and well. Man is by nature an imitat or. Let an American stay in Br itain for some time and when he returns, he may sound like an Englishman. Let there be a fashion cha nge started and watch how quickly folks will a ttempt to imitate. By st udying the life of Jesus, man learns what truth is personified. Jesus said: \"I am the way, th e truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the father, but by me.\" John 14:6. The more we lear n about Jesus, the more we will want to b ecome like him. However, the mo re our eyes take in the satanic influence of this world, the more a person can be transformed into its image. In the ancient world Satan degraded the mo rals of the people and le d them to commit the lowest abominations known to mankind by us ing Nimrod, Semiramis and Cush, who were worshipped as gods through various names and myths. Everything fr om cannibalism, human sacrifices, incest, sacred pros titution, homosexuality, murder, ra pe, self-mutilation, torture an d suicide, to magic, sorcery, spell-casting, fo rtunetelling, necromancy, warlockery, and so on, did the gods do in the epics of their lives. Therefore, th e ignorant pagans who worshippe d these false gods followed in th eir footsteps. Now, in these m odern times, its the movie stars, rock stars and athletes who have become the gods that many worship. Do not our children or adu lts receive a steady diet of th ese same atrociti es committed by these stars in the roles they portray? Even the children's cartoons are saturated with crime an d violence. Are not the soap operas full of this junk? Awake! Aw ake! Can't the reader see the subliminal seduction by the hidde n instigator of sin? Can't the reader see that there is definitely a reason behi nd all this crime and violence show n on TV, in movie theaters, and in magazines and newspapers? Let's take a look again at the realm of music. Do we really need to ask where some of these rock groups get their inspiration? Take for instance Kiss, who pa int their faces and leap on the stage puking blood, declaring, \"God of Rock and Roll, we'll steal your virgin soul.\" The p roducer Bob Ezrin described Ki ss as \"symbols of unfettered evil and sensuality.\" Roc k magazines call them \"fire-breathing de mons from Rock and Roll Hell\" [1]. One of the members of Kiss, Peter Criss, boldly declares, \"I find myself evil. I believe in the Devil as much as God. You can use either one to get things done.\" Another member of the group has been quoted as saying: \"If God is hot stuff, why is he afraid to have other gods before Him? I've always wanted to be God\" [2]. Another Rock group we s hould take a look at, who have been a great in fluence towar d Satanism, is the Rolling Stones. Keith Richards' heroin arrest and his statement express what they stand for: \"There are black magician s who think we are act ing as unknown agents o f Lucifer\" [3]. Also, the songs they have made, such as the revolutionary propaganda of \"Street Fighting Man,\" and the anthem of satanist \"S ympathy for the Devil\" or \"Dancing with Mr. D\" (the Devil), bear out Richards' comment. The lead singer of Led Zeppe lin openly admits to a fascina tion with black magic, and the guitarist, Jimmy Page owns the home of the late, infa mous Aleister Crowley, whom we studied earlier. Jimmy Page sa ys he has his own occult books hop because, he explains, \"There was not one good collection of books on the occult in London and I was tired of having to go all different places to get the books I wanted\" [4]. Page was asked if he were a practicing witch, and he answered with: \"I do not worship the Devil. But magic does intrigue me\" [5]."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" The Bible warns that what we behold is wh at we will be changed into. King David in the Psalm 119:37 said: \"Turn my eyes from beholdi ng vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.\" Satan from the time of Adam a nd Eve used every device he coul d foster to take the eyes of f goodly things to set them upon the evil things . Shortly before the French Revolution, the Illuminati destroyed what li ttle faith the French had in Christ by writing pamphlets to distribute among the people. T oday, their anti-Christian atta cks are a hundred times more subtle. They are using Hollywood, special inte rest groups, the Femi nist Movement, Civil Rights groups, the Federal Reserve Act, Congr essmen, Senators, and even Presidents to degrade and divide the people in the United States into differ ent hate factions, as they di d during the French Revolution to destroy that government and Christianity. They were known as the Jacobin Clubs in the 18th century in France, and today they are called Communists. Two weeks after the Kennedy assassination, the la te FBI Chief, J. Edga r Hoover, issued this warning: \"We are at war with Co mmunism and the sooner every red- b looded American realizes this the safer we will be\" [6]. The same poisonous propaga nda that caused the French Revolution is steadily brainwashing our youth as well as the adults today. Can any born-again Christ ian be so bli nd as to doubt that the influences of Communism and the promotion of Witchcra ft today are taking their toll among Americans? Just as a sincere be liever in Christ receives a born again experience (spiritual awakening) -- \"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creatur e: Old things are passed away; behold, all things become NEW. \" 2.Corinthians 5:17 -- so is there a counterfeit experience o f this found among witches. Just as a sinner experiences joy in hi s heart when he makes peace with God through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and is baptize d, and no longer wants to live a life of sin, so does a witch have a similar experi ence of relief when he accepts the belief foun d in Witchcraft that Jesus is an imposter. In many covens, before a witch can be initiated into the arts of Witchcraft, the initiate, if not born into a family of witches, must take a ceramic cross and turn it upside down, then break the cross- b ar downwards. This is to show othe r witches that they have reject ed Christianity and Jesus Chri st. Today many ignorant people, who call themselves Christians, hold this sign up to show that they are for peace, when in reality it shows they ha ve rejected Jesus. The reason the name PEACE was tagged on this evil sign is derived from the peace wi tches say they get after a new initiate shows his rejection o f Christianity, and when he practi ces the arts of Witchcraft. This art of using gullible Christians to promote Witchcraft propaganda is done through subliminal warfare. The Bible reveals to its re ader what God is like. \"But we all with open face BEHOLDING as in a glass the glory of the Lord, ARE CHANCED INTO THE SAME IMAGE FROM GLORY TO GLORY even as by the Spirit of th e Lord.\" 2.Corinthians 3:18. When the reade r studies the life of Jesus Christ from the Sc riptures the Holy Spirit illuminates his inne r thoughts with an image that his own life will begi n to imitate. God will mold little by little the character of a wicked person in to reflecting the righteousness of God, which was seen in the life of Jesus. By beholding Jesus we become changed into His image. It was in 1947 that America was awakened slightly from he r deep sleep to see what the Communists were up to. However, America just opene d her eyes a little, then fell back into a deeper sleep than before. Communists have thei r agents planted in every social and political issue that is connected with the affairs of this country. He re quoted from the Congressional Record for the year 1947, on page 2691 we read the warning: \"The American Communists launched a furtive attack on Hollywood in 1935 by the issuance of a directive calli ng for a concentration in Hollyw ood. The orders called for action on two fronts: 1. An ef fort to infiltrate the labor unions . 2. To infiltrate the so-called intellectual and creative fields. \"In movie circles, Communists developed an effective defense a few years ago in meeting criticism. They would counter with the question, 'After al l, what is the matter with"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Communism?' It was effective because many persons did not possess adequate knowledge o f the subject to give an intelligent answer. \"Some producers and studio heads realize the possibility that the entire industry faces serious embarrassment because it could beco me a springboard for Communist activities. Communist activity in Hollywood is eff ective and is furthered by Communists an d sympathizers using the prestige of prominent persons to serve, often unwittingly, the Communist cause. \"The Communist tactic of infiltra ting LABOR UNIONS stem s from the earliest TEACHINGS OF MARX, which have been reit erated by party spokesmen down through the years. They resort to all means to gain th eir point and often succe ed in penetrating an d literally TAKING OVER LABOR UNIONS BEFORE THE RANK AND FILE MEMBERS ARE AWARE OF WHAT HAS OCCURRED. \"With few exceptions the following adm onitions of LENIN have been followed: 'It is necessary to be able to withst and all this, to agree to any a nd every sacrifice, and even - i f need be - to resort to all sorts of devices, maneuvers, and illegal methods, to evasion an d subterfuge, in order to penetrate into the tr ade-unions, to remain in them and to carry on Communist work in them at all cost.'\" (p.38 Left Wing Communism, An Infantile Disorder, vol. 1, Lenin 1934, International Publishing Co., Inc) Now can the reader unders tand why there is so much se x, crime, and anti-Christian p ropaganda constantly seen in the theater and on tele vision? The average American citizen is completely unaware of the Co mmunist plot to program the American people into accepting Socialism by degrading Christian principles an d exalting Sodomy, because all of the networks of television and radio, the magazines and newspapers ar e controlled by these same conspirators who are running Communism. To see that these things are so, let us now examine the history of how Communism began to infiltrate the American society and how the House of Rothschild connected American New York Bankers with the Illuminati. Now shortly before Karl Marx began to write theCommuni st Manifesto, another Illuminist in America published a book that also outlined the plans of Ad am Weishaupt. His name was Clinton Roosevelt (a direct ancestor of Fr anklin D. Roosevelt) . His book was called The Science of Government Founded on Natural Law. In it Roosevelt had some of the same p hilosophy shown in Adam Weishaupt's writings, \"that the men of the Illuminati are to be regarded as the most perfect and enlightened of men\" [7]. And in his book, Roosevelt outline d the plans of the Illuminati for the regime ntation of ALL MANKIN D. In other words, enslavement of the vast populati ons of the world. To accomplish this, the whole world was to eventually be reduced to what we studied earlier during the French Revolution. Des Griffin quotes a statement made by Cl inton Roosevelt about how Roosevelt felt about our Constitution: a \"leaky vessel which was ha stily put together when we left the British flag\" [8]. He also stated his atheistic and blasphemous feelings toward our Creator in his boo k b y saying: \"There is no God, of justice to orde r things aright, if there be a God, he is a malicious and revengeful being, who created us for misery.\" Clinton Roosevelt publishe d his book in 1841. Before this Illuminati propaganda was p ublished to poison the minds of Americans, another Illuminist played maybe even more of a p art in spreading poison to degrade the morals of the American people. This Illuminist was sent to the United States from England, like a Christia n missionary is sent to a foreign land to p reach the Gospel of Christ. Sh e arrived in New York in 1818 and later in 1828-29 held a series of lectures among American Illumini sts. Now remember, the word Communist was not used before by Illuminists to describe this movement until Karl Marx wrote the Communist Manifesto in 1844-48. But, here we will lear n where the word Communist actually derive d from and what these Luciferians' real plans are for America. In Des Griffin's book, Fourth Reich of the Rich, he states the following: \"In 1829, American Illuminist s sponsored a series of lectur es in New York by English"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"IIluminist Frances 'Fanny' Wright. She advo cated the entire Weis hauptian program of he r auxiliary of the Order of the Illu minati including CO MMUNISM MADE MORE PALATABLE BY THE LAB EL OF 'EQUAL OPPORTUNI TY AND EQUAL RIGHTS, ATHEISM, EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN AND FREE LOVE. Those present were informed that the Illuminati intended to UNITE THE NIHILIST AND ATHEIST GROUPS WITH ALL OTHER SUBVERSIVE ORGAN IZATIONS INTO AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION TO BE KNOWN AS COMMUNISM . This new destructive force was to b e used by the Illuminati to foment future WARS AND REVOLUTIONS. Clinton Roosevelt (a direct ancestor of FDR), Ch arles Dana and Hora ce Greeley were appointed a committee to raise funds for this new undertaking.\" Four th Reich of the Rich, Griffin, Emissary Publications, 1979, p. 62. So you see, the Communist movement, as a t ool to foment future wars and revolutions by the illuminati, was actually formed here in the United States! Frances \"Fanny\" Wright's revolutionary aims for the Unite d States could be seen in a tract she wrote called Views o f Society and Manners in America. The London Quarterly Review said of her book: \"A most ridiculous and extravagant panegyric on the government and people of the U.S. accompanie d by the grossest and most detestable calumnies against the country\" [9]. In the mid 1800's Albert Pike emerged to jo in this Luciferian Conspiracy. As we learne d earlier, Albert Pike became the most re cognized leader and author of Freemasonry. He was also the head of an order that promoted the exa ltation of Lucifer who were calle d the Palladists, which most Ch ristian Masons neve r knew about. In 1834 Giuseppi Mazzini, the Italian revolutionary who was appointed by the Illuminati to be its director after Adam Weishaupt died, appointed Albert Pike to head the operations of the Il luminati in the Unite d States [10]. Eventually, Mazzin i and Pike divided betweem them the work that was to be done to carry on this One World Government Cons piracy planned earlier by Adam Weishaupt. Pike took control of the THEOSOPHICAL SIDE of their ope rations while Mazzini was in charge of the POLITICAL SIDE of the Order. To further their goals to destroy the Christian religion and to promote a Luciferian One World Government, Pike as the head of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, organized another Orde r of Freemasonry calle d the \"new and reformed Palladian Rite.\" He named this after th e Luciferian Order of which he also was the head, then he established th is Order of Freemasonr y with Three Supreme Councils in the world. They were in Charle ston, SC, Rome, Italy and the third in Berlin Germany. The promotion of the worship of Lucifer was then openly laid out to these Freemasons by instructions issued by h im on July 14, 1889, to 23 Supreme Councils o f Freemasonry in the world. Now in order that the read er may understand what Pike sa id to these 23 Supreme Councils, the reader must remember what we earlier learned about in the modern beliefs found in Witchcraft. Modern day witches say they do not worship Satan. They believe Satan an d Lucifer are not the same god, as Christians believe. Satan, to modern day witches, is just a Christian invention to scare people into being good. However, higher witches and Doctors o f Occultism believe Lucifer is really the Good God, while they say it is Jesus Ch rist who is the Evil One. Des Griffin quotes Lady Qu eenborough's book, Occult Theocrasy, that records Pikes own words: \"That which we must say to the crowd is \"We worship a God, but it is the GOD one adores with out superstition.\" \"To you, Sovereign Grand Instructors Gene ral, we say this, THAT YOU MAY REPEAT IT TO THE BRETHREN OF THE 32nd, 31st, 30th de grees: The Masonic religion should be, by all of us initiates of the hi gh degrees, maintainjed in the purity of THE LUCIFERIAN DOCTRINE.\" \"IF LUCIFER WERE NOT GOD, WOULD ADONAY (the Christian God) whose deeds prove his cruel y, perfidy, and hatred of man, barbarism and repulsion fo r science, would Adonay and his priests calumniate him?\" \"YES, LUCIFER IS GOD, AND UN FORTUNATELY ADONAY IS ALSO GOD.

De La Rive, p. 588; and Occult Theocrasy by Lady Queenborough, pp. 220, 221) Quoted from Fourth Reich of the Rich, Griffin, pp. 70, 71. Here is another shocking quot e from this Apostle of Lucifer that all sincere Christians o r N on-Christians everywhere bette r become aware of. Pike, in a letter dated August 15, 1871, (which until recently was on di splay in the British Museum Library in London) gave Mazzini details of the Luciferian plan for the world c onquest. In this letter he outlined the plans FO R THREE WORLD WARS. Pike said during the THIRD WORLD WAR: \"WE SHALL UNLEASH THE NIHILI ST AND ATHEISTS, AND WE SHALL PROVOKE A FORMIDABLE SO CIAL CATACLYSM WHICH IN ALL ITS HORRO R WILL SHOW CLEARLY TO THE NATIONS THE EFFECT OF ABSOLUTE ATHEISM, ORIGIN OF SAVAGRY AND OF THE MOST BLOODY TURMOIL. THEN EVERYWHERE, THE CITIZENS, OBLIGED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST THE MINORITY OF REVOLOTION ARIES, WILL EXTERMINATE THOSE DESTROYERS OF CIVILIZATION, AND THE MULTITUDE DISILLUSIONED WITH CHRISTIANITY, WHOSE DEISTIC SPIR ITS WILL FROM THAT MOMENT BE WITHOUT COMPASS (DIRECTION), A NXIOUS FOR AN IDEA L, BUT WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE TO RENDER ITS AD ORATION, WILL RECEIVE THE PURE LIGHT THROUGH THE UNIVERSAL MANI FESTATION OF THE PURE DOCTRINE OF LUCIFER, BROUGHT FINALLY OUT IN THE PUBLIC VIEW, A MANIFESTATION WHICH WILL RESULT FR OM THE GENERAL REACTIONARY MOVEMENT WHICH WILL FOLLOW THE DE STRUCTION OF CHAISTIANITY AND ATHEISM. BOTH CONQUERED AND EX TERMINATED AT THE SAME TIME.\" Quoted in Fourth Reich of the Rich, Griffin, pp. 71, 72. Now can the reader see who is behind th is Charles Manson Family, and motorcycle gangs, some Rock groups, Hollywood and Television, high interest rates, Feminist movements, civil rights organizations, and Labor Unions that are degrading the American people into different hate factions akin to that of the French Re volution? The Bible pred icted this revolutionary force as the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit. But, we live in a time where we can examine this movement inwardly because Histor y says its been worki ng behind the scenes to b ring these plans around since the French Revoluti on. We can trace their f ootprints in history, to show where they began and wher e they lead and who they are. To plainly state it, all the footprints from Adam Weishaupt's time to our time will lead us to the doors of a ring of international bankers, who control th e worlds wealth, and have the same b eliefs as Albert Pi ke. Under them is a network of industrialist, scientists, military an d p olitical leaders, e ducationalists, economis ts and entertainers. It is a well known fact that International Bankers have fina nced nations to fight against each other. Where do you think the countries get their mone y to buy tanks, guns, uniforms, etc., to arm their nations for war? They bor row from international bankers. International Bankers have financed both sides of countries at war with each other. They care not who wins b ecause, while the nations are borrowing huge amounts of money to kill each other, international bankers make huge amounts of money from the inte rest charges they make the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"nations pay. They also have th e power to control the out-come of the war by simply cutting off the flow of money they lend. So under the th reat of war, international bankers have use d their power to gain or increase control over governments. By ke eping a nation in debt to them they are in a position to demand a voice in the government affair s of that nation. However, another goal which they have al ready achieved is to control all the world's Monetary Systems. Here we will learn how Am erican bankers connected with the Rothschilds and the History behind the Federal Reserve Trap. Gary Allan, in his book None Dare Call It Conspiracy, points ou t that in Karl Marx Communist Manifesto, one of the planks written for world c onquest was to get control of the Monetary Systems. Gary says: \"Lenin later said that the establishm ent of a CENTRAL BANK WAS NINETY PERCENT OF COMMUNIZING A COUNTRY. Such conspira tors knew that you ca nnot take control o f a nation without military forc e unless that nation has a central bank through which you can control its economy.\" None Dare Call It C onspiracy Allan, Concor d Press, 1971, pp. 41, 42. It was on May 1st, 1776 that Adam Weishaupt backed and le d by the House of Rothschild, formed the International Revolutionary force called the Illuminati which later became known as Communism. Now, the revolutionary sloga n for the Illuminati in Latin, was \"NOVUS ORDO SECLORIUM,\" which means \"A NE W ORDER FOR THE AGES,\" which comes from the philosophies of Astrology. As we saw earlier, the insi gnia on the back of a dollar bill with the ALL-SEEING-EYE, was a Witchcraft sign found among the Masons, which th e illuminati was a part of shortly after the Americans signed the Declarati on of Independence, on July 4th, 1776. Americans are made to b elieve that the Roman num erals MDCCLXXVI on the pyram id, which add to 1776, is to celebrate Independence Day of luly 4th, 1776. But reader, nothi ng could be further from the truth about this matter. This occult sign wi th its slogan \"NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM\" is to commemorate the founding of the Illuminati on May 1st, 1776, not the fourth of July. And, it is not by chance that the EA GLE which was a symbol for Luci fer to the ancients, and was known as the Phoenix, is now used as a symbol of the office of the President of the Unite d States, which according to Bible Prophec y, will \"SPEAK AS A DRAGON.\" Revelations 13:11. To show some more subliminal warfare of the devil by his people, let us look at the numbe r 13 to see its importance to th ese conspirators. The number 13 to witches is a most powerful magical number in prac ticing warlockry. As established earlier, Witch covens today have usually 13 members in number, but do vary. When witche s cast spells to injure people or cure them, 13 witches stand within the pentagon, (the center of the five pointed star), and call on spirit guides (familar spirits De ut. 18:11) which are in reality demons, and the witches control them to do their bidding. The demon appears in the center of the Pentagram (the five pointe d star). Reader, now take a very close look on the back of your One Dollar Federal Reserve Note. N ot only is the Phoenix (EAGLE) displayed here, but look closely at the stars over the eagle's head. Notice there are 13 stars. Look how they are arranged. It is not by chance that these 13 stars from the HEXAGRAM which by the way, is the most EVIL SIGN IN WITCHCRAFT. Americans are made to believe that these 13 stars represent th e 13 original colonies [12]. However, if the reader will agai n look closer into this great s eal of the United States, he will discover that those who designed this seal did not di splay this magical number 13 by accident. N ote the number of times 13 is used. 1. The Hexagram formed by 13 Pentagrams (stars) 2. The Eagle Breast Shield has 13 stripes. 3. There are 13 Berries on the olive br anch in the eagle's right talon. 4. There are 13 arrows in the eagle's left talon. 5. There are 13 leaves on the olive branch."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" But for the record, the reason again for th e witchcraft signs found on the back of the One Dollar Federal Reserve Note is because the six men who ha d a part in its design were Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jeff erson, Francis Hopkinson (also the designer o f the flag), Charles Thoms on, and William Barton [13]. As stated earlier more than 50 of the si gnatories of the Declaration of Independence were earlier Masons or Rosicrucians a nd were identified with the esot eric sciences (the occult). So you see, it is not hard to unde rstand why the Federal Reserve displays witchcraft signs on their notes, because, believe it or not, the Federal Reserve itse lf, is comprised of 12 membe r banks and one Federal Reserve Board -13 in all. The reader will be shocked to know that the Federal Reserve is not a U.S. run institution. Now, let's trace its footprints to see where they lead. Again, in the mid 1800's another German il luminist was sent on a mission from the House of Rothschild to accomplish a goal of this New Order For the Ages. His name was Jacob Henry Schiff (1847-1920). He came to New York first for the so le purpose of getting control of the United States m onetary system. He eventually beca me the head of the banking firm o f Kuhn, Loeb & Company. He bought Kuhn & Loeb out later with Rothschild money. He also became the director in many im portant corporations, including the New York City N ational Bank, the Equitable Life Assurance So ciety, and the Union P acific Railroad [14]. Using charity as a front to hide his Illu minati One World Govern ment activities, Jacob Schiff became one of the most important successors of Albert Pike in leading the Unite d States towards anarchy. As stated by Lenin earlie r, one of the first goals of the communists is to get control of all monetary systems of the world. And this wa s to be Jacob Schiff's first achievement. On December 22, 1913, began one of the worst acts the communists accomplished that pushed Americ a towards the doom it was to experience in Albert Pike's p lan for world conquest. Here we will really see how the Bible is so correct in stating how we are at war with \"spiri tual wickedness in high places\" Ephesians 6:12. A Republican, Senator Nelson Aldrich pr oposed a National Reserve Association in 1911 consisting of a Central Bank, fi fteen branches, and a top board controled by the nation's leading bankers (which was then dominated by J.P. Morgan) of whom we will study more o f in a moment. But Aldrich's proposal never pa ssed. However, the Il luminati conspirators landed one of their first men to become a Pr esident of the United States. His name was Woodrow Wilson. We will al so look into the life of Wilson a nd what part he played in this conspiracy in a moment. However, before we examine how actually our Presidents become canidates for the offi ce, we should understand another acheivement that Jacob Schif f accomplished in the United States. This was c onnecting the bankers of America, J.P. Morgan, Paul Warburg, and the Rockerfellers into this Luciferian Conspiracy. Gary Allan in his boo k \"None Dare Call It Conspiracy\" states how th e American big bankers formed a confederacy with Jacob Schiff, who was act ually working as agent for th e House of Rothschild: \"Paul Warburg married Nina Loeb daughter of Solomon Loeb of Kuhn Loeb and Company, America's most powerful intern ational banking firm. Brother Fe lix married Frieda Schiff, daughter of Jacob Schiff, the ruling power behind Kuhn, Loe b.\" Stephen Bi rmingham writes in his authoritative Our Crowd: \"In the eighteenth century the Schiffs and Roth schilds share d a double house\" in Frankfurt. Sc hiff reportedly bought his partnership in Kuhn and Loeb with Rothschild money. Both Paul and Felix Warburg became partners in Kuhn, Loeb an d Company. \"None Dore Cell It Cons piracy\" Allan, Concord Press, 1971, p.45. Senator Nelson Aldrich, whos e daughter married John D. Rockfe ller Jr, together with Paul Warburg and other internationist bankers set-up a secr et meeting at Jekyll Island Georgia to make plans to get control of America's Banki ng Systems by establishing a central bank. Some of the invited guests were Henry P Davidson of J.P Morg an and Company; Frank A. Vanderlip, President of the Rock efeller owned National City Ba nk; Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury; A. Piatt Andr ew and Benjamin Strong of Mo rgan Bankers Trust Company"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"[15]. It was stressed during this secret meeting that in orde r to get Congress to accept this Central Bank Scheme, the name \"C entral Bank\" must be avoided at all cost. Out of the Jekyll Island meeting came the Aldrich Bill. But, th e centralization of th e American Banks neve r p assed through Congress. However, these conspirators just fe ll back and regrouped again an d re-named the Central Bank Conspi racy, \"The Federal Reserve Ac t,\" to make it sound more like a U.S. Government run agen cy. And to see to it that it would pass thro ugh Congress this time they landed their very first president in office. His name was Woodrow Wilson. Jacob Schiff, Bernard Baruch, Henr y Morgenthau, Thomas Fortune Ryan, and New York Times Publisher Adolph Ochs, all contributed he avily to finance the Wilson Campaign [16]. When Wilson tried to get this Central Bank called the \"Fed eral Reserve System\" to pass through Congress, he chose Rep. Carter Glass to propose this Federal Reserve Act instead o f Aldrich. And in December while Congress desi red to adjourn for Christmas the Federal Reserve Act was passed by a vote of 298 to 60 in the House and the Senate by a majority. As it was during th e French Revolution, so is it toda y. The Illluminists or Communists have p enetrated into the high levels of American Politics, and the High levels of its governmental institutions. Be not deceived! They have thei r top men posing as Congressmen, Senators, even Presidents, FBI and CIA agents, as milit ary officers, and even as clergymen. The power of the Illumnati is money. And they use their money to gain control in the Religious, Political, Economical, Educational, Medical, Militar y, and Social areas that deal with society as a whole. And during the \"R ussian Revolution,\" it was under the name o f \"Bolshevism\" that the Illuminati penetrated in these same areas and caused the overthrow o f Czarism in Russia. Des Griffin in his book \"Fourth Reich of the Rich,\" has co mpiled some very important facts about who were working behind the scenes in the Russian Revolution: \"After being thrown out of France and Spain, Leon Trotsky and his family arrived in New York aboard the steamer Monserrat on January 13, 1917. Although he was never known to have a job, the Trotskys lived in a fashionable apartment and traveled around in a chauffeure d limousine. For some time the source of his wealth was unknown. \"Trotsky left New York aboard the S.S. Kr istianiafjord bound for Petr ograd to organize the Bolshevik phase of the Russian Revolution. When the ship docked at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on April 3, 1917, the Trotsky party was detained by Canadian authorties under instructions received from the British Admiralty in London. \"Within hours, great pressure was brought to bear on Canadian aut horities by high officals in both Washington and London to recently declassified by th e Canadian government, reveal that the authorities knew that Trotsky's group were 'Socialists leaving (America) for the p urpose of starting revolution ag ainst the present Russian govern ment... (Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, by Antony G. Sutt on, Arlington House publ ishers 1974, p. 28). Trotsky and his group were quick ly released.\" The Fourth Reich of the Rich, Emissary Publications. 1979, p. 89. Des Griffin goes on to show where the money came from th at was needed for the Russian Revolution: \"President W oodrow Wilson was the fairy godmother (pre sumably unde r instructions from 'Col. House and his backer s') who provided Trotsky with a passport to return to Russia to carry forward the revoluti on. This American passport was accompanied by a Russian entry permit and a British transit visa.\" Jennings C. Wise, in Woodrow Wilson: Disciple of Revolution, makes the pertinent comment, \"History must never forget that Woodrow Wilson, despite the efforts of the Bri tish police, made it pos sible for Leon Trotsky to enter Russia with an American passport (Sutton, p. 25).\" \"In April 1917, Lenin and a party of 32 Ru ssian revolutionaries, mostly Bolsheviks, j ourneyed by train from Switzer land across Germany through Sw eden to Petrograd, Russia. They were on their way to join Leon Trotsky to complete the revolution. Their trans-Germany transit was approved, facilitated and financed by the General St aff\" unknown to the Kaiser (p."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"39). At this time Max Warburg, the brother of Paul and Felix Warburg, leading instruments in shackling the \"Federal\" Reserve System on the American nation, was high up in German intelligence. Max was also the head of the Rothschild/Warburg ba nk in Frankfurt. VERY INTERESTING! Can anyone doubt that the inte rnational bankers we re running the whole show from behind the scenes?\" Fourth Reich of the Rich.\" Gr iffin, Emissary Publications, 1979, pp. 89-91. It was confirmed by the New York Journal American of February 3, 1949 that Jacob Schif f gave 20 million in gold to help the fina l triumph of Bolshevism in Russia.\" Now we need to take a deep look into the American politics a nd learn how this same Luciferian threat is planni ng and working behind the scene in the United States, as they succeeded in doing to th e Russian people. Jacob Schiff, agai n acting from orders of the House of Rothschild, planned an organization akin to that of the Jacobin Club s and the Bolsheviks in Russia. These aristocratic terrorists would pene trate into American pol itics as their brethren did before them in France and Russia. Woodrow Wilson was the sole property of Jacob Schif f and J.P Morgan and other internationalist ba nkers. But the man who was really running things in the White House was the mysterious \"Col.\" Edward Mandel House during Wilson's term in office. Col. Edward House, who was a British-educated son of a representative of England's financial interest in the American South, wrote a revolutionary book which he admitted to later, that revealed plans to overthrow the government of the United States. The book was called Philip Dru: Administrator, and it was sy mbolically written to also show the detaile d p lans for the creation of a One World Totalitarian Government. It was House and the internationalist ba nkers who promoted Wils on as the Presidential candidate. Woodrow Wilson, who was the 28th President of the US, served two terms as President from March 4th, 1913 to March 4t h, 1921. But it was House who converted Wilson to accept the principles of the centralization of the US Monetary System. It was House that helped promote the Presidential candidacy of Franklin D. Roos evelt [18]. It was Franklin D. Roosevelt who gave the Communists East Germany and eastern Europe. And it was Edward M. House under the watc hful eye of Jacob Schiff, who was under the watchful eye of the HEAD of this internati onal conspiracy (the House of Rothschild o f London and Paris), that estab lished in 1921 what their earl ier comrades established, to overthrow the governments of France and Russia. Called the Jacobin Clubs in France in the 18th century, this aristocratic revolutionary movement today in America is called THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, INC. and its off-shoot is the TRILATERAL COMMISSION. The Council on Forei gn Relations, Inc. is the poli tical side of the illuminati today. They have produced Congressmen, Senators and even Presidents, that they have use d to pass laws that have little by little le d America into becoming a Socialist country. The Trilateral Commission is an internat ional organization founded by David Rockefeller, who also had a part in founding the Council On Foreign Relations, Inc., and who is the chairman of the board [19]. The Trilateral Commission is the Illuminati's attempt to unite Western Europe's Common Market, Japan, Canada , and the United States, into an economic and political confederacy. What they couldn't do through the political si de of the Illuminati (Council On Foreign Relations, Inc.), they are trying now through the economic approach. The first attempt in the 20th century to uni te the whole world into a One World Luciferian slave unit was tried in history by these super-ric h conspirators at the close of World War I. President Woodrow Wilson on January 8th, 1918 laid out a 14 point plan to Congress fo r lasting peace\" [20]. Within this package of world peace was n eatly hidden a plan for these conpirators to get all na tions of the world to give up their sovereignty. It was labeled as \"The League of Nations.\" These modern money changers used World War I to make tons of money and as a tool to frighten the war-torn people of the world at that time into believing if all the governments o f"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"the world would unite into a One World Gove rnment, this would st op all wars between nations, and would achieve world peace and security. The League of Nations headquarters was in Geneva, Switzerland, a nd it was during Worl d War I that our own President Woodrow Wils on in 1918 began to draw the United States citizens, along with the rest of the world, into accepting this sh am. Eventually with the help o f \"Col.\" Edward Mandell House, 63 nations joined the League , although the total membership at one time never exceeded 58. However Pr esident Wilson was dumbfounded when he was unable to obtain the two-thirds vote in the US Senate required for ratification of a treaty, and the United States never joined The League of Nations. This caught these Conspirators complete ly off guard because surely, they thought, the United States would fall for th is sham, for it was the President of the United States who was p romoting it. Now when the Conspirators saw that thei r One World Government couldn't be achieve d using the name The League of Nations, Col. House, under the direct ion of Jacob Schiff, formed an aristocratic secret organization called the Council On Foreign Relations, Inc. This p rivate Secret Society is to produce enough Congressmen, Sena tors and Statesmen, etc., so the next attempt to incorporate the US into a One World Government will not fail, because o f the voting power they hope to have. But read er, remember, this is not a United States Government run establishmen t. Here from their own publ ication, Council On Foreign Relations, Inc., Annual Report 1979-1980, which is controlled by David Rockefeller, we rea d the following on page 5: \"The Twenty-one Americans, who, together with British counterparts, founded in Paris in 1919 'The Institute of International Affairs,' were a diverse group that included Col. Edwar d M. House, Herbert Hoover, Gen. Tasker Bliss, Christian Herter, and su ch scholars as Charles Seymour, later president of Yale , Professors Archibald Cary C oolidge of Harvard and James T. Shotwell of Columbia. In 1921 their American branch of the Institute MERGED WITH A LARGER, EXISTING GROUP OF NEW YORK BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN TO FORM THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, INC.\" We are living today durin g their second attempt for thei r NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM, the N ew World Order. The Council On Foreign Re lations, Inc. is onl y the Illuminati front working in the United States for world govern ment; their brethren in England, as we have already read, are The Institute of Interna tional Affairs. Another super-rich group fo r Internationalism which the IRS approved, is a so -called charitable or ganization called The American Friends of Bilderbe rgers. The Bilderberg moveme nt, like the Jacobin Clubs in France, chose their name from th e name of the meet ing place where they held their first meeting. In this case, it was the Bilderberg Hotel in Oosterbeek, Holland in May of 1954. Like the lacobin Clubs, Bolsheviks and the Council On Foreign Relations, Inc., The Bilderbergers are an aristocratic Secret Society for the superric h. It is made up from the worl d of international banking, polit ical circles, and business a nd professional people. They hol d top-secret meetings annually to promote Internationalism. The chairman of this Secret Society of the elite is one Pr ince Bernard of the Netherlands, royal consort of Queen Juliana, who is reported to be the ri chest woman in the world. Queen Juliana and Lord Rothschild are the principa l stockholders of Shell Oil Company, while the Rockefellers control Standard Oil. The Bi lderbergers are also known as \"The 500.\" Des Griffin states some names of the invited guests to the Bilderbergers annual meeting in his book, Fourth Reich of the Rich, page 118: \"A lot can be learned fr om noting the names of the peopl e who attend these clandestine annual meetings: David and Nelson Rockefeller, Emilio Collado, Executive Vice President o f Exxon Corporation, Ciovanni A gnelli, owner of the Fiat car company, Robert Strange McNamara, President of the World bank, Hein z (Henry) Kissinger, Gerald Ford, Senato r Mathias, Britan's Prime Mi nister James Callaghan AND his \"conservative\" counterpart"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Margaret Thatcher, Rothschild puppet Presid ent Valery Giscard D'Estang of France, an d many other people in similar pos itions in various nations.\" Now, according to the Council On Fo reign Relations, Inc.

Howard Baker, George Ball, Harold Brown, E llsworth Bunker, Donald Bush, Hodding Carter, Douglas Dillon, Arthur Goldber g, Alexander Haig, Jacob Javits , David LIttle, Henry Cabot Lodge, George McGovern, Robe rt McNamara, Walter Mondale , Donald Began, Dean Rusk, Adlai Stevenson III, and Andrew Young are just a few names listed in their annual report, as members of this Secret Society. Back in the days of Wilson, the headquart ers for this international New World Order was The League of Nations. Today this masterpiec e of deceptions is called the United Nations. Many of the same nations that were duped by thei r leaders into joining The League of Nations were duped again into joinin g the United Nations [21]. The UN, like The League of Nations, was se t up after the world expe rienced the horrors o f war, in hopes that this time, th e war-torn people of the United States would jo in. The League of Nations really only di ffered in two ways from the United Nations of today. Instead of its headquarters being located in Geneva, Switzerland, this time the conspirators placed it in New York City. Who donated the money to buy the la nd and the building materials to unite the nations? It was John D. Rockef eller who sank 18.1/2 million as a gift to the UN, to buy 18 acres of land along the East River in New York, where it is located today [21]. Gary Allen, in his multi-mi llion best seller, N one Dare Call It Co nspiracy, states the following about who actually laid the founda tions to this modern day Tower of Babel: \"At least FORTY-SEVEN C.F.R. (Council On Foreign Relations, Inc.) members were among the American delegates to the founding of the United Nations in New York City in 1945. Members of the CFR group indluded Haro ld Stassen, John J McCloy, Owen Lattimore (called by the Senate Internal Se curity Subcommittee a 'conscious articulate instrument of the Soviet conspiracy'), Alger Hiss (Communist spy), Philip Jessup, Harry Dexter White (Communist agent), Nelson Rockefeller, John Fo ster Dulles, John Carter Vincent (security risk), and Dean Acheson.\" None Dore Coil It Conspiracy, Allan, Concord Press, 1971, p. 86. As we learned earlier from the pen of the modern Luciferian prophetess, Alice Bailey, the most diabolical scheme to bring about a One World Religi on and a One World Government shall be perpetrated through the medium of th e United Nations sham. The ultimate goal today in the One World Luciferian Government Conspiracy is to take the weapons away from the citizens of the world so they will have no pr oblem exterminating thos e who will not bow to their god. This is to be done by conditioning th e gullible world into accepting the phony peace p lan which is to set up the United Nations as th e policemen of the world. Under this plan, the United Nations would discipline any nation that would try to start a war, by threatening that nation with nuclear weapons, which the nations were to hand over to them. However, as we warned before, the real mo tive behind this scheme is to use these weapons to cleanse the world of the billions of pe ople who will not adhere to their wishes. Not one in 1000 citizens of America who adhere to the princi ples of Jesus of Nazareth are aware of what is about to fall upon them. Not one in 1000 American citizens, even non- Christians, have any knowledge of how organizat ions like the Nationa l Rifle Association an d their Institute for Legislative Action have kept the Luciferian s from accomplishing their worl d take-over plans. It has been th e members of the National Rifle Association and their Institute for Legislative Action who have been battling wi th such gun-law strate gists as the American Civil Liberties Union which, by the way, was the legal organiza tion that used Congress to abolish prayer and Bibl e study in public schools.

The Bible expresses that the whole world ha s been deceived into false systems of religions which were invented by Lucifer. The Scriptures admonish us to turn to our Creator \"and worship him that made heaven, and earth, a nd the sea, and the fountains of waters.\" Revelation 14:7. We have not reached this pe riod of time yet when the United States will speak as a dragon, and how he \"exerciseth all the power of the fi rst beast before him (Papacy), and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to wors hip the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.\" Revelation 13:11,12. But we are hurrying toward the fulfillment of these predictions. Hardly a day goes by that the read er will not see some thing in the US about the great work the Pope is doing in the world. Constantly, the Pap acy is being exalted directly or indirectly b efore Americans as a Great Re ligious Movement working in the world for the benefit o f mankind.

In the Bible, the doctrines she adopted from Sun worship and forced people to obey or die, are called the Wine of her fornication. Revelation 17:2,4.

In other words, the US will al so become a religious dictatorship that will force the idolatry of the Papacy on its citizen s and cause the other nations of the world to follow its example. It will be the Protestant s in America, not the Papacy itself, but the Protestants, that will reinstat e the Papacy with its Pope, in another religious tyranny even worse than during the first 1260 years it cast th e Truth to the ground. It has been foretold and it shall come to pass. But, the reader may question, how could this ever happen in the US? In our Constitution we are protected from any religi ous movement forcing religious laws on people which force citizens to obey religious opinions and beliefs. The goal of all three of these powers foretold in Scripture \"that go out into the world to gath er them together whose names are not written in the Lamb's book of life\" will be to cha nge our Constitution by simply calling for an amendment or Constitutional c onvention. As stated before, th ese three powers as symbolized in Scripture are: ++ Dragon - Beast from the Bottomless Pit (Communism) ++ Beast - First Beast of Revelation 13:1 (Catholicism) ++ False Prophet - Second Beast of Revelation 13:11-17 (Ame rican Protestantism) They are ever working separately be hind the public eye in high places within ou r government to change, and eventu ally try to throw out, our C onstitution. Be not deceived, the Papacy has planted their agents in our government just like the Communists have. They too have had Congressmen, Senators, and even a Pr esident that have been inventing laws along with the Communists, that have little by little been chiseling away our Constitution. Remember, Adam Weishaupt, th e real author of the Comm unist Manifesto, learned to infiltrate governments by once being a Jesuit priest himself. The Jesuits are the Gestapo of the Roman Catholic Church. If the reader needs something to show wh at the Papacy's real intentions are for America, he re is a bit of information ri ght from their own publication, that should alert any loyal America n, Christian or non-Christian: \"Protestantism is just as wrong now as it was in 1517. It is the duty incumbent on us as Catholics to 'spread the word' and make America Catholic ... Fath er Isaac Hecker founded the Paulist Fathers for the express purpose of ma king America Catholic. They are still at it and doing a fine job of it. It is the goal of every bishop, priest and religious order in the country. N o Catholic can settle, with good conscience, for a policy of appeasement, or even mere co- existence with a non-Catholic community.\" Our Sunday Visitor, luly 31, 1960 - Quoted from Preparation for the Final Crisis, Chaij, P acific Press Publishing Association, 1966, p. 177. But the reader still may question how the Papacy could un ite with Communism, along with the Protestants, into a New World Order when th e Papacy appears to be so set against it? This may quickly be answered by just briefly looking into the modern philosophy of both Catholicism worldwide, and Protestantism in these modern times. In John Stormer's book, The Death of a Nation, he brings out how Ca tholicism, Protestan tism and Communism are today finding mutual ground: \"The fight against communism, J. E dgar Hoover has said,'... is economic, social, p sychological, diplomatic and strategi c - but above all IT IS SPIRITUAL.' \"America is losing the economic, social, di plomatic and strategic battles with communism because the traditional spiritual leaders of the nation - the churches and the clergy - are largely committed, knowingly or unknowingly, to the communist side. \"This is a serious charge - but careful investigation shows that churches and men who call themselves 'Christian' are deep ly divided today.\" The Death of a Nation, Storme r, Liberty Bell Press, 1968, p. 90.

It may seem to be a contradicti on to state that Communism and Catholicism and Protestantism will unite under one banner af ter stating Communism wants to destroy Christianity. However, Communism, as stated before, is not being run by Communists, but by the Luciferians, who control the wealth of th e world. They want to cause another \"Reign o f Terror,\" and this time the anarchy is to be world-wide. Communism , Catholicism, and Protestantism are ALL just tools of the Devil which he is using to eventually destroy the Real Religion of the Bible, and attempt to ma ke Lucifer the only god of this world. Using Catholicism, Protestantism, and Communism, the Luciferians hope to throw the world into complete mayhem, so in the end, the people of the world who survive this coming Holocaust will become disillusioned with both Christianity and Communism, and just as during the French Revolution, blam e Christianity and Christ as the reasons for the world's p roblems. Earlier, Albert Pike made this very clear. This is no nursery rhyme or part in a play we have been presenting before you, these thi ngs are for real, and d eadly serious. This is Satan's last effort to take complete control of this world. Jesus Himself predicted what will happen in the last days we live: \"And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that gi ve suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neith er on the Sabbath day: For then shall be Great Tribulation, SUCH AS WA S NOT SINCE THE BEGINNIN G OF THE WORLD TO THIS TIME, NO, NOR EVER SHALL BE. AND EXCEPT THOSE DAYS SHOULD BE SHORTENED, THERE SHOULD NO FLESH BE SAVED: BUT FOR THE ELECT'S SAKE THOSE DAYS SHALL BE SHORTENED.\" Matthew 24:19-22. To continue to show how these three unclean spirits will gather th e people of the world into a great battle against its Real Creator, let's now look at how Communism has penetrated into Protestantism. International bankers have ma de a ton of money fi nancing nations to buy weapons to kill each other. Any concerned Christian who has any insight into Bible prophecy can see that the Korean and Vietnam Wars, li ke the World Wars, were just a money making venture by these international bankers who are controlling American foreign policy. The United States could have flattened the wh ole nation of North Vi etnam without sending one soldier to walk its territory. Without using the nuclear bomb, th e US Naval Fleet or the US Ai r Force could have stopped the Communist aggre ssion in Vietnam many years before it ended. One doesn't have to be a military officer to say that. But the f act is, the military leaders were under orders not to end the wa r. The long, meaningless Viet nam war only accomplished three things. First it proved to be a bonanza for the super-rich . Second, it destroyed over 50 thousand American men and women. And third, it helped destroy the morale of many Americans. What many Americans do not r ealize is that the Communists ha ve been using Christianity to spread Communism by posing as missionaries, and great humanitarians , while at the same time overthrowing countries by ri ot and revolution. In the name of Peace th ey have destroyed many. To put it bluntly, the Comm unists have been working through Protestant organizations and civil rights groups to spread th eir movement. What appeared at first to be a Protestant Christian organization is now a po litical monster coming in the na me of Christianity. It is one of the biggest Communist traps next to the Unit ed Nations. And like the United Nations, it too had Communist elements behind its founding. We are pointing to the organization which calls itself The World Council of Churches, and its offshoot called The National Council of Churches. It was the World Council of Churches that helped Vietnam fall completely into the Communists' hands by using its members to p ressure the US into stopping its bombing of Nort h Vietnam. Stormer goes on to state in his book, The Death of a Nation, what the World Counc il of Churches did to prolong the war: \"American efforts to prev ent communism from enslaving th e people of South Vietnam has"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"b een attacked and condemned by major chur ch leaders and organizations. Since 1966, the World Council of Churches, of which most major U.S. Protesta nt denominations are a part, has regularly denounced American efforts to halt communism's spread. In February 1966, fo r example, the Central Committee of the Worl d Council meeting in Geneva, Switzerland... called upon the United States to halt its bombing of North Vietnam, pull its troops out o f South Vietnam, and 'revie w and modify' its policy of trying to contain communism.\" St. Louis Post Dispatch, Fe bruary 16, 1966. Quoted in Death of a Nation, Stormer, Liberty Bell Press, 1968, pp. 90, 91. Stormer wrot e his book while the Vietnam war was still going on. And as we now know, the United States did stop its bombing of Nort h Vietnam and did pull out of South Vietnam leaving millions of doll ars of military equipment as a gift to the Communists to give to othe r Communists to help with their ef forts in spreading riot and re volution in other countries such as Central America. The World Council of Churches was formal ly constituted at Amsterdam on August 23, 1948 [1] for the sole purpose of re ligious ecumenicity for the New World Orde r of the super-rich. Even though the Roman Catholic Church k eeps itself at a short distance from being a member of this Protestant movement, the Roman Catholic Church for years has been advocating not only a religious ec umenical merger, but also a so cial one as well. She has been showing for the past few de cades how she will merge wi th the Dragon (Illuminati- Communistic-Socialistic Movement) and her herald, the False Prophet (Apostate Protestantism), as it was pred icted almost 2,000 years ago in the book of Revelation 13:11-17; 16:13,14. John A. Stormer has also compiled info rmation from an offici al publication of the Catholic Church, showing how today the Roman Church is beginning to merge with Communism: \"John C. Bennett is a lead er in the World and National Counc ils of Churches. As head of on important seminary he is res ponsible for training young minister s. He frequently appears on television to give the 'Christian ' point of view on major issues . Yet he cannot bring himself to condemn a godless force which has brutally slaughtered 40-milli on Chinese. His words show he is not a naive, uninformed man. He knows the communists used brainwashing, mass murder, and dictatorship in bri nging communism to China. Even so, he refuses to reject these 'means' because they are being used to achieve what he beli eves is a good end. \"Bennett is not alone in his views.

July 17, 1966. \"SIMILAR VIEWS ARE EXPRESSED IN CATHOLIC CIRCLES. Msgr Charles Owen Rice, in his column in the Oc tober 6, 1966 Pittsburgh Catholic , official publication of the diocese of Pittsburgh, PA., used almost the sa me words os John C. Bennett. Msgr. Rice wrote: \"It may sound strange coming from a Catholic priest, but I am convinced we should pray fo r the survival of the present government of China ... The present government, even though Communist, has brought order to its vast nation, order and ad mirable measures of internal p eace.\" \"Mao Tse-tung and his followers have cha nged China utterly and the change has been fo r the better... To be sure he has established and maintained tight control, and has insisted on an austere program. He incessantly propagandizes. He , alas, uses hate as a weapon for control and motivation.

Communism, The Papacy, and the Apostate Protestant Church es will unite shortly into one movement as the Scriptures have predicted, with the office of th e Pope directing the affairs o f this New World Order. But be fore the ordinary people will accept this New World Order, there will come a spirit of worl d-wide revolution that will be seen everywhere, especially in the streets of the citie s of the United States. The riots of the 1960's were only a shadow o f what's coming. All this anarchy is to frighten the world into believi ng that a new world orde r is the only solution to avoid the en tire destruction of the human race. However, before the whole world will be th rown into complete anarchy our Lord's last day message is to go out into the world. This last day message is given as we have read in Revelation 14:6-10. This last da y message is to go out to ev ery kindred, nation and tongue an d p eople before God allows Satan to throw the world into a holocaust which has never been witnessed in the histor y of this world. In Revelation 18:1- 5 our Lord is calling His people out of Babylon which represents the coming confederacy of a One World Religion and One World Government that has left God out as it was in the days of Nimrod. The time allowed by God to keep in check the universal destructi on among all nations is sy mbolized in Revelation 7:1-3. \"And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wi nd should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw anot her angel ascending from the east having THE SEAL OF THE LIVING GOD: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to wh om it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have SEALED THE SERVANTS OF GOD IN THEIR FOREHEADS.\" Not only will man cause dest ruction in this coming holocaust, but nature herself will be thrown out of order. Jesus fo retold in Luke 21:10-13, 25,26: \"T hen said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom anainst kingdom. An d GREAT EARTHQUAKES shall b e in divers places, and FAMINES, and PESTILENCES; and FEARFUL SIGHTS AND GREAT SIGNS SHALL THERE BE FROM HEAVEN. But BE FORE ALL THESE, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and into p risons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake. And it shall turn to you fo r a testimony. And there shall be SIGNS IN THE SUN, AND IN THE MOON, AND IN THE STARS: AND UPON THE EARTH DISTRESS OF NATIONS, WITH PERPLEXITY; THE SEA AND WAVES ROARIN G; MEN'S HEARTS FAILING THEM FOR FEAR, AND FOR LOOKING AFTER THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE COMING ON THE EARTH: FOR THE POWERS OF HEAVEN SHALL BE SHAKEN.\" All this is to happen shor tly before Jesus come s again. \"And then shall they see the Son o f man coming in a cloud with power and great glor y. And when these things come to pass, then"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"look up, and lift up your heads; for your re demption draweth nigh.\" Luke 21:27 28. Those who are alive in these last days w ho are to go through this coming great tribulation must be sealed in their foreheads with th e seal of the Living G od. The Scriptures have p redicted that the majority of th e earth's inhabitants wi ll accept the Mark of the Beast, for the Protestants of the United States will \"causeth all, both sm all and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in thei r right hand, or in their fo reheads.\" Revelation 13:16. There is a Seal of God and a Mark of the B east (Papacy). It will be these two principles that will separate those who will obey God or Lu cifer. As we studied throughout this book, Satan has always used camouflages and religious rites that teach just the opposite of what the Lord says in Scripture, to turn people to him in stead, through a network of false gods and false doctrines. Sun worship was and st ill is the biggest rival of Tr ue Christianity. In order to understand what the Seal of God is, the reader must understand just who was Jesus Christ. In the book, Beware Its Coming The Antichrist 666, published by Workers For God, Inc., it is brought out for the ordinary reader very clearly: \"Before the birth of the real incarnate of God, the Seed that will bruise the serpent's head, the real Bright and Morning Star, the real God-Man, was to make His appearance on the b ehalf of man, Satan's messiah had already been preached and worshipped throughout the world, counterfeiting the religious rites passed down to God' s people by the Patriarchs. Satan tried to destroy the True Faith by false gods, and when the written word was given, Satan hoped the learned men of the worl d would look to Christ as ju st another pagan messiah. When the Greatest Advent in man's history came into the world for the salvat ion of the human race: 'He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and ac quainted with grief: And we hid as it were our faces from h im; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath b orne our griefs and carried our sorrows: Yet we did esteem him strick en, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressi ons, he was bruised for our iniquities: The chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.' \" Isaiah 53:3-5. \"In the ancient world, Satan deceived mill ions with the darkness of pagan Sun worship. In these modern days Satan has take n on a brighter look, it's called Christianity. Instead of using the name Baal, which means Lord or Master , he is coming in the name of Jesus.\" \"But when ye shall see the abominati on of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand) then let them that be in Juda flee to the mountains: And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither ente r therein, to take any thing out of his house. And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment. But woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days.\" Mark 13:14-17 \"One thousand years before the first advent of our Lord, Da vid likened the people of God to Sheep, and our Lord to a GOO D SHEPHEAD. David was a she pherd as a boy, who protected his sheep from the evil beasts ar ound them. David, just a boy, killed a lion and a bear that too k a lamb out of his flock. See 1.Samuel 17:34- 37. David knew as the shepherd of the fiel d p rotected his sheep from the ev ils of the world, so does the Go od Shepherd in Heaven watch over His Flock. Just as the shepherd of the fi eld could call hi s sheep by name, and his sheep knowing his voice would follow, so will the pe ople of the Lord's Flock hear His voice from the Scriptures and do the things which He co mmands us. One millennium before God became a Man in Christ, David wrote: \"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restor eth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths o f righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow o f death, I will fear no evil: For thou art with me: Thy rod and t hy staff, they comfort me. Thou p reparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anoint est my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodne ss and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\" Psalm 23."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" At a later time, Jesus said: \"I am the Good Shepher d, and know my sheep, and am know n of mine. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and th ey follow me.\" John 10:14,27. \"In these final days of ear th's history, there are multitudes of Christian c hurches, pastors, p riests, Bible instructors, laymen, using tele vision, radio, magazines, newspapers, and tracts p roclaiming the Gospel of Chri st; however, there is much re ligious confusion. But if the seeker would forget about what churches have to say, and find th e Lord of the Bible, and see k to do His will: 'Then shall ye return, and di scern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him th at serveth him not.' \" Malachi 3:18. \"Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of Hosts; I am the first, and I am the last, and beside me there is no god. And, behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every ma n according as his work shall be . I am Alpha and Omega, the b eginning and the end, the first and the last. I Je sus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of Da vid, and the bright and morning star.

Quoted from Beware It's Coming - The Antichrist 666, W.F.G., Inc., 1982, pp. 107, 108 (by permission). If the reader would like to study more into the deceptions with which Satan has fooled both p agans and Christians alike, may we reco mmend you get yourself a copy of \"Beware It's Coming - The Antichrist 666.\" It proves through archaeology a nd history that Sun Worship indeed began with Nimrod, and th at the Roman Catholic Church doctrines are from paganism and not from the Bible. They prove this by a complete study of Catholicism using their own p ublications. This book, Beware It's Coming - The Antichrist 666, is one of the most complete studies about the Antichrist and that mysteri ous number 666 that has ever been published. The reader should try to find a copy in a Book and Bible House. Indeed, very few who call themselves Christians realize that it was Jesus Himself who created this Earth. Jesus is the God of the Old Testament which spoke through the Old Testament Prophets. It was jesus who told Eve that \"the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\" Genesis 2:17. Paul , describing Jesus to the Ephe sians, tried to make them understand, by saying: \"And to make all men see wh at is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ.\" Ephesians 3:9. Again Paul, de scribing who Jesus was to Timothy, said: \"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manife st in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gent iles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.\" 1.Timothy 3:16. Jesus Himself said : \"I and the Father ar e one.\" John 10:30. We ar e very much aware how some churches deny that Jesus was God and the existence of th e Holy Trinity. But the Bible says: \"For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: And these three are one.\" 1.John 5:7. Jesus is the Word Of God incarnated. Re velation 19:11-13. John saw Jesus in a vision and said: \"And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth Judge and ma ke war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crow ns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed wi th a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called THE WORD OF GOD.\" The Apostle John described Jesus as the Word Of God that created the whole universe: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word wa s with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and wi thout him was not any thing made that was made. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), fu ll of grace and truth.\" John 1:1-3, 14."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" Jesus Christ was God manifested in the Fles h. It was Jesus who was the creative force of the Godhead that said, \"Let there be light.\" Ge nesis 1:3. \"In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who is the im age of the invisible God, the firstborn o f every creature: For by him were al l things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: All things were created by him and for him.\" Co lossians 1:14-16. The Ch ild that Isaiah the Prophet said that was to be born of a virgin (Isa iah 7:14) also said \"his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Might y God, The Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. \" Isaiah 9:6. It was Jesus who gave Moses the Ten Commandments. And it was Jesus who said in the Fourth Commandment, Exodus 20:8-11: \"REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY, TO KEEP IT HOLY. Si x days shalt thou labour and do all thy work: But the SEVENTH DAY (Satur day) is the SABBATH OF THE LORD THY GOD: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy s on, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor the stranger that is within thy gates: FO R IN SIX DAYS THE LORD MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH, THE SEA, AND ALL THAT IN THEM IS, AND RESTED THE SEVENTH DAY: WHER EFORE THE LORD BLESSED THE SABBATH DAY, AND HALLOWED IT.\" The seventh day Sabbath was given to man to help him remember that it was Christ himsel f who created the heaven and earth in six days and rested on the sevent h day from all of His works that he had made. Multitude s of Protestant Doct ors of Divinity, Past ors, Teachers, etc., will tell us that the seventh day Sabbath was on ly given to the Jews to observe. However, this is as false as the worship of the Sungod. Jesus gave the sevent h day Sabbath at Creation which was over 2,000 years before the Jews came into history. In Genesis 2:1-3 we read: \"Thus the heavens and the earth were fi nished, and all the host of th em. And on the seventh day God (Christ) ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And G od blessed the seventh day, and sa nctified it: Because that in it he had rested from all his wo rk which God created and made.\" The seventh day Sabbath recognizes Jesu s Christ as creator of this world. Sunday observance is not from the Bible, but from th e astroloical worship of the Sun-God. Sunday is the first day of the week, not the seventh day. From th e Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. IV, Schaff, Funk & Wa gnalls Company, 1894, P. 2259, we read the following: \"Sunday (Dies solis, of the Roman Calendar, 'Day of th e Sun,' because it was dedicated to the Sun), the first day of the week , was adopted by the early Christians as a day of worship.\" On the same page of this Ency clopedia, we read the following: \"No regulations for its observance are laid down in the new te stament, nor, indeed, is its observance even enjoined.\" As we studied earlier, in the worship of the Sun-God, every th ing that was first was dedicated to the Sun-God and so was the first day of the week. This is Satan's counterfeit to our Lord's day. According to Funk & Wagna lls Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Sunday was substituted for the seventh day Sa bbath given at creation by Christ himself by early Christian men, not by the one who inst ituted the Sabbath. Sunday observance was instituted by men, not by Christ or his apostles. We are fully aware that there are Protestant Pastors and Teachers tell ing the congregations that the orig inal day of worship (the Seventh Day) was changed to commemor ate the resurrection of Christ , however, that sounds good, but their is no such commandment in either the Old or the New Testament commanding Christians to observe the pagan day of Sunda y. Absolutely Not! On the contrary, Jesus Himself warns about tampering with the Word of God as we saw earlie r in Revelation 22: 18, 19. Man is not to change or a dd anything to Sacred Scriptur e. \"Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.\" Proverbs 30:6. Many are those who tell others that it was Jesus who changed the Sabbath from Saturday to"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Sunday, but the Bible says \"I am the Lord, I ch ange not;\"...\"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.\"...\"Therefore the son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath day.\" Malachi 3:6, Hebrews 13:8, Mark 2:28. Jesus is our example. He came down from Heaven to show His people how to live and the right road that will lead to eternal life. \"Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light o f life.\" John 8:12. If we claim to be Christians we cl aim also to be His foll owers. \"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.\" 1.John 2:6. In othe r words, if you say you are Christian, you ar e to walk in Christ's footprints. \"And he came to Nazaret h, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to rea d.\" Luke 4:16. Jesus kept the Seventh Day Sabbath holy, not th e pagan day of the Sun-God which is the first day of the week, which is even called Sun- Day, the day of the Sun-God, who in reality is Lu cifer. It was Satan who changed the Sabbath into Sunday, not Christ or His apos tles. This was also foretold. Daniel the Prophet in the seventh chapte r of Daniel predicted four acts that the Little Horn would do against God in Daniel 7:25: \"A nd he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and th e dividing of time.\" As we stated before, th e Little Horn of Daniel 7:8, 23, 24, and the First Beast of Revelation 13: 1-10 are symbols of the Papa cy. Daniel the Prophet foretold in more detail what the Papacy was to do against the Most High, wh ile John in the book of Revelation 13:1-10, 18 saw a similar vision of this an ti-Christian power, but was given a clue that would absolutely identify it as a deception of Satan's, for it would be bra nded with Satan's number 666. We will see more of this in a moment. We have already seen how the Papacy has fulfilled everyt hing in history which Daniel foretold about it except one of the four points of Daniel 7:25: \"and think to change times and laws.\" Here, from the Roman Ca tholic Church's own publication, is really who is responsible for tampering with God's Law th at has caused millions to tram ple it underfoot. \"The Catholic Church for over one thousand years before the existence of a Protes tant, by Virtue of he r divine mission, changed the day from Saturday to Sunday.\" Catholic Mirror, Sept., 1983. From another Roman Cath olic publication, we again read the following: \"Of course the Catholic Church claims that the change was her act...And the act is a Mark of he r ecclesiastical authority in religious things.\" H. F. Thom as, Chancellor of Cardinal Gibbons. From another Roman Catholic publication called, Plain Talk fo r Protestants, p. 213 we read the following: \"The observance of Sunday by the Protestants is an homage they pay in spite o f themselves to the Authority of the Catholic Church.\" The Roman Catholic Church does not hi de the fact that it was her church that is responsible for throwing away the Commandment to keep Holy the Seventh Day as it is set forth in the Fourth Commandment found in the Ten Commandments. (Ex odus 20:8-11). In the book Unfolding the Revelation, Roy Allan Ande rson, D.D. it states the following: \"Whatever the Mark of the Beast is, it must be some thing clear and definite. God's unmingled wrath would not be reserved as a punishment for an unknown offense. Furthermore, the mark of the beast must be in contradistinction to the 'seal' or mark of God. His seal, the sign of His creative power, as we have already not ed, is God's rest day, or the true Sabbath. It follows that th e seal or mark of this univers al apostasy would be man's rest day, or the false day of worship. Unfoldi ng the Revelation. Anderson, Pacific Press Publishing Association, 1974, p.155. As we have already obs erved, too, throughout this book that those who deal in Witchcraft have always had their secret si gns to let other occu ltist know who they are, so does the Lord of the Sabbath let His people know that they have the right God: \"And hallow my Sabbaths; and they shall be a SIGN be tween me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord you r"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"God.\" Ezekiel 20:20. Sunday is the MARK of the beast (Papacy ). The seventh day Sabbath is the SEAL of God. The mark of the beast and the seal of God, are not a literal mark on the forehead as multitudes have said. Lucifer is at war with Cod over the control of th e mind of man. The Mark of the Beast is applied when Sunday- Keepers by law force the observa nce of Sunday as a day o f rest. Today they are called BLUE LAWS. Th e Sabbath and the false Sabbath, Sunday, will shortly bring the line of distin ction between those who will sett le in their minds which of the two powers they will obey, the Roman Catholic C hurch, or the Christ of the Bible. Looking to the end of the world Jesus said to those who will go through this Great Tribulat ion: \"But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day.\" The end of the world has not yet come. And Jesus tells us to pray that our flight to the wilderness during the coming holocaust be not in the winter or on the Sabbath Day, showing Je sus stills holds man responsible today for keeping the Sabbath Day holy. In Revelation 14:6- 11 is Christ's last warning to the worl d. In it, He is ca lling His people to turn away from the Papacy and worship Him w ho created the Heaven, Earth and the Sea, and the fountains of waters. When you observe the Sabba th (Seventh Day) as it is set forth in the Ten Commandments, you are show ing that you recognize Jesus Christ as the Creator. When you observe Sunday, you are showing you obedience to Rome. It was Satan who used the Roman Catholic Church to change, and tuck away the original day of worship, to Sunday, which derived out of Sun-worshi p. And, \"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to w hom ye obey;\" Romans 6:16 (first part). In ancient times, Kings would use a seal to authorize all their important documents. A seal is a badge of authority. A seal not only shows th e king's author ity, but also his territory, and his name. When a worshipper of Christ observes the Sabbath of the Bible, he shows that he recognizes Christ's authority, His ownership of this world, and that th ere is \"none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\" Acts 4:12. The False Sunday Sabbath will be the tool that will unite the merchants and the labo r unions which are controlled by The Illuminati, to join the Protesta nts in a joint effort to force through legislation the observance of Sunday, which will bring persecution on those who do not recognize it. The God of the Bible is calling to Him a peopl e who will follow Hi m all the way and will help restore the Seventh Day Sabba th back to its rightful place. Even in the New Heaven and N ew Earth, God's true people will be observi ng the Seventh Day Sabbath. Isaiah, the Prophet foretold this in Isaiah 66:22, 23: \"For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass that from one new moon to a nother, and from one Sabb ath to another, shall all flesh come to worship be fore me, saith the Lord.\" The Lord of the Sabbath is calling Hi s people who have been deceived by the Papacy, whether they are members of the Catholic Chur ch or are Protestants who have been taught to observe Sunday, to come back to the doctrines of the Bible and co me out of Babylon the great, which is a symbol of all churches that teach doctrines that derived out of Sunworship. The Bible makes very clea r that the THREE UNCLEAN SPIRI TS or the three powers that go forth to gather the world agai nst God will combine their forces under one banne r. It will be the Principle of Sunday legislation that will be the factor that will become the issue, that they will find common ground which will unite them under one banner. \"These have one mind, and shall give their powe r and strength unto the Beast.\" Revelation 17:13. Once a believer finds out about the Papacy's apostasy, a nd how they have been duped into b elieving in a system of false Ch ristianity, the Lord will demand his or her loyalty to Him. As we showed from Scripture earlier, our Lord accepts our worship ev en if we are in error, if we are worshipping him with knowledge we have received. But when our ignorance has been exposed, we are to turn from error and dar kness, to Truth and Light. Sunday worship is a"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"invention of Satan himself and it is the Mark (Sign) of a postasy while the Seventh Day Sabbath is a Seal (Sign) that we are the property of God. Won' t you take your stand to restore the ancient day of rest that recognizes Jesus as the Creator? During the 1260 years of the Papal aposta sy, the Scriptures foretold that Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots, would move its seat from Babylon to eventually end up in Vatican City. However, Babylon the Great is not onl y the Papacy, it is al l religions that teach these same doctrines we have studied throughou t this book. The Lord makes it very plain that he has people still in Babylon and he is calling them out! This Great Fa lse Religious System is also predicted from Scripture to be destroye d, and those who do not take their stand to come over to the Lord's side will also receive th eir reward. \"And after th ese things I saw anothe r angel come down from heaven, having great power, and the ear th was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily wi th a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fa llen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bi rd. For all nations ha ve drunk of the wine of the wrath of he r fornication, and the kings of the earth have comm itted fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundan ce of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.\" Revelation 18:1-4. The line that will show who are really on God's side a nd who are just pretending, will be clearly seen in those who make an all out effort to follow Je sus all the way. The Christian has b een duped by the Devil a nd conditioned by the Devil to observe Sunday as a day of rest. The whole world schedules its acti vities either around Sunday or Friday (the Moslem Sabbath), while the real day of worship (the Seventh Day Sabbath) has b een neatly tucked away as a whole. Revelation 14, wh ich warns about receiving the Mark of the Beast, in the same chapte r also goes on to show those wh o are not deceived and have recognized how to avoid being deceived. \"Here is the patience of the saints: Here are they that keep the commandments o f God, and the faith of Jesus.\" Revelation 14:12 In another area of this last book of the Bible, it clearly shows our Lord's True Church and how the Dragon (Devil) has made open avowed war on her. In Revelation 12:17 we read: \"And the Dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war wi th the remnant of he r seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.\" Reader, that's all TEN, not just nine of them. \"For whos oever shall keep the w hole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if t hou kill, thou art become a transgessor of the law.\" James 2:10, 11. Once saved, always saved, is as false as Sunday worshi p. Jesus makes this very plain in Matthew 7:21-23: \"Not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in Heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? An d in thy name have cast out devils? And in thy name done many wonderful works? And th en will I profess unto them, I never knew you: Depart from me , ye that work inquity.\" Even to people who call themselves Ch ristians, who can cast out devils, speak in tongues, foretell the future, or perfor m healing miracles, our Lord says: \"To the law and to the testimony: If they speak not according to this word, it is b ecause there is no light in them. He that saith I know Him, and keep eth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even, his prayer shall be abomination.\" Isaiah 8:20, 1.John 2:4, Proverbs 28-9. Even though the reader may have tr ampled underfoot the Seve nth Day Sabbath which recognizes Christ as creator, our Lord is still holding back th e winds of destruction so that those who are still in Babylon ma y have a chance to flee out of it before it receives its p lagues. God promises a blessing on those who ma ke their stand for Him in Isaiah 58:13-14."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" \"If thou will turn away thy foot from th e Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my Holy Day, and call the Sabbath a delight , the holy of the Lord, honourable, and shalt honour Him, not doing thine own ways, nor findi ng thine own pleasure, nor sp eaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\" Now to show the reader that there is no mi stake in identifying this Beast where Satan's seat is (Revelation 13:1, 2), who even boasts about changing God's Law, \"Here is Wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the nmber of a man; and his number is Six hundred threes core and six.\" Revelation 13:18. The Beast here is the Papacy as we have already seen. Our Lo rd made it very plain that this religious power will al so be branded with Sa tan's number. Our Lord does not leave His people in darkness about this. In Unfolding The Re velation, by Roy Allan An derson, he has compiled some very interesting facts that show how th e Papacy is branded with this number of doom. Let us now see how the Papacy itself and the name of it's P ope today, add to 666. Here found on page 130 of Anderson' s Unfolding The Revelation is the location of this Beast's residence. Here in Greek with its numerical values, is \"HE LATI NE BASILEIA,\" which means in Greek with its transliter ations, \"THE LATIN KINGDOM\" [2]. H E L A T I N E B A S I L E I A 0 8 30 1 300 10 50 8 2 1 200 10 30 5 10 1 = 666 The name \"LATIN\" is derived from the earlier Romans, centuries before the age of the Papacy. It was the na me of the Sun-god who the earl y Romans worshipped. Hence the Romans, to identify themselves with their Sun-god, adopted their god' s name. They called themselves \"LATINS.\" Here is a name that sh ows in what country this religious power has its church. Here again in Greek with its transliter ations and numerical values is \"ITALIKA EKKLESIA\" which means in Greek, \"ITALIAN CHURCH\" [3]. I T A L I K A E K K L E S I A 10 300 1 30 10 20 1 5 20 20 30 8 200 10 1 = 666 The Papacy not only adopted the pagan rites of the early Roman Sun worshippers, but the sacred language of the paga n Romans. LATEINOS is the Greek spelling for Roman Sun-god (L atin). It also means, \"Lat in-speaking Man,\" or \"Latin Man.\" Here is the Latin-speaking man (LATEINOS) [4]: L A T E I N O S 30 1 300 5 10 50 70 200 = 666 Now here from a Roman Catholic authori zed publication, the official name of the office o f the Pope: \"The Title of the Pope of Rome is VICARIUS FILII DEI and if you take the letters of his title which represent Lati n numerals (printed large) and a dd them together they come to 666.\" Our Sunday Visitor, Nov. 15, 1914. quoted from Beware Its Comi ng - The Antichrist 666, W.F.G., Inc., p. 143. Here is VICARIUS FILII DEI which means in Latin \"VICAR OF THE SON OF GOD,\" added in Roman Numerals [5]: V I C A R I U S F I L I I D E I 5 1 100 0 0 1 5 0 0 1 50 1 1 500 0 1 = 666 Since the publication of Roy Allan Anderson's Unfo lding the Revelation, and The Antichrist 666, there have been elected two new Popes. And, a new dynasty to what the Papacy claims to be the suc cession of Peter. There have be en in numerous newspapers and magazines claiming Pope John Paul to be \"C hrist in the Flesh,\" which is blasphemy. And ironically enough, if you write John Paul Vicar of God in LATIN, and add it up in Roman N umerals, you get:"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" I U A N P A U L O V I C E D E O 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 50 0 5 1 100 0 500 0 0 = 666 The book of Revelation predicts that all pow ers of this world, incl uding the Illuminati and apostate Protestantism, will make the Papacy the absolute authority in the near future. It may appear that the Papacy is at odds with Communism, however, through the sure word o f p rophecy they will unite. It may sound confusing to some, but that's actually why the Divine Language in Revelation 17:5 cal ls it Mystery, Babylon the Great , the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth. Babylon means c onfusion, and this term applied here in Revelation 17:5 means the great spiritual c onfusion of the world. Babylon the Great is p ictured in Revelation 17 as s itting on a scarlet (red) color Beast that ascends from the Bottomless Pit (Spiritualism), which symbolized the Illumina ti-Communistic-Socialistic movement today. This shows that this Politi cal Power is also to become world-wide. However, it will be the Papacy that is to be th e Head of this last Poli tical Power again shortly before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The Beast that ascendeth out of the Bottoml ess Pit has eight powers, and we have already seen that heads on a Beast in Bible prophecy represen ts the controlling pow ers. It is still unclear what powers for sure ar e the eight powers mentioned in Revelation 17:9-11 and it is dangerous to be dogmatic when it comes to unfulfilled prophecy. Ho wever, we can know fo r sure who the first five are, because they have already passsed in histor y. Says the Bible: \"And there are seven kings: FIVE AR E FALLEN, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. And the beast th at was, and is not, even he is the EIGHTH, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.\" The first five heads here suggests: Babylon, Persia, Gr eece, Pagan Rome, and Papal Rome. It is the sixth and seventh he ad where most who have studi ed deep into the Mystery o f Godliness have still a problem solving because we have not reached in history as yet when the Papacy is fully restored. However, we ca n be positive in saying that the eighth powe r represents the confederacy of Communism, A postate Protestantism and the Roman Catholic Church. There are, however, some suggestions of who the sixth and seventh heads are. One Bible Commentary suggests the following about the Ei ght Powers found on the Beast that ascendeth out of the Bottomless Pit: \"Acc ording to this pattern of inte rpretation the powers represented b y the first five heads would be Babylon, Persia, Greece, The Ro man Empire, and the Papacy. The Sixth and Seventh Heads might be Revolutionary France and the United States, or the United States and a restored Papacy.\" S.D.A. Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 855. So, the eight powers may be: Babylon Papacy Persia Illuminati (Communism) Greece United St ates (Apostate Protestantism) Rome Papacy, United States, Communism Before we close there is another importan t issue of the day we n eed to seriously examine. Attorney Constance Cumbey, while invest igating \"The New Age Movement,\" exposed another goal of these One World Luciferian G overnment conspirators. They will call for a \"World Food Authority\" [6]. Although we do not agree at al l with Constance Cumbey's interpretation of Revelation the 13th and 17th chap ters, however, we do beli eve that there is a wealth of valuable information for concerned Christians and non-Christians alike, found in he r book that will help a seeker of truth avoid being anothe r victim of this world-wide conspiracy. We suggest the reader obtain a copy of The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow, by Constance Cumbey. We are very much aware of the ma ny different interpre tations given throughout Christendom about who th is Second Beast is in Revelation 13:11-17 and how this Mark of the Beast shall keep the true followers of Jesus of Nazareth from buying a nd selling. One of the"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"most popular interpretations found in the 1980's on this subject tells us that this Second Beast of Revelation 13:11-17 is not a political power (U.S .), but it is supposed to be a man who is a Jew from the tribe of Dan and a master of Satanic magic. He will proclaim that the \"First Beast\" (which has been interpreted also as a ma n, not a political power) is the Antichrist and it will be this \"False Prophet\" (S econd Beast, Rev. 13:11-17) that will cause the whole world to worship the First Beast (man who is the Anti-christ), because he w ill claim to be God [7]. This \"Second Beast,\" according to Hal Linsey, is th e \"False Prophet\" (man) who will force the worship of this \"First Beast\" (man), who wi ll be a Roman dictator. And this, according to Lindsey, is the Antichrist. Now, this last world dictator, accordi ng to Mary Stewart Relfe, Ph.D., will control the world's buying and selling through the Universal Product Code th at is found now on the bac k of the items you buy at your favor ite supermarket. Mary Stewar d Relfe states in her book, The N ew Money System 666, on page 206, what she thinks is the Mark of the Beast: \"The Mark of the Beast, the only unpardona ble sin specifically named in the Bible, and the only sin for which God metes out a named 4-fold punishment is: 1. Receiving of one's own volition the Mark (b rand) in the right hand or forehead; which I b elieve will be a bar code facsimile incorporating a concealed use of '666', unintelligible to the eye, which will entitle one to all the benefits of \"Man's Great Societ y,\" in exchange for: 2. Worship of the Beast (Man) who claims to be God; and 3. Worship of his image.\" This would sound very interesting to the casual seeker who would like to know what this most solemn warning really means. However, those who are learned in the areas of Bible p rophecy and have studied deep into Jewish symbolism, know that what Relfe and Linsey stated about the \"Two Beasts\" found in Reve lation the 13th chapter (as being two men), b reaks every law of good Biblical scholarship. A Beast, in Bible prophecy, is a symbol of a \"political power,\" not an indi vidual man. Daniel the Prophet was clearly shown this (Daniel 7:17, 23, 24). Like the names Baal and Eel, multitudes also get the Number of the Beast (666) and the Mark of the Beast conf used as being the same thing. They are NOT the same thing. There are five different warnin gs from our Lord concerning id entifying with this Beast (who is the Papacy). 1. Worship of the Beast 2. Worship the image of the Beast 3. Receive the Mark of the Beast 4. Or have the Name of the Beast 5. Or the Number of his Name (666) The Mark of the Beast is not the Universal Prod uct Code. It is a settling in your mind o f whom you will obey. The \"First Beast\" found in Revela tion 13:1-10 is symbo lized here as the Papacy and all the pagan nations before it that promoted Spirit ualism. The Mark of the Beast is forced observance of the False Sabbath, S unday. The Roman Catholic Church is responsible today in causing the majority of Protestant Churches to tram ple underfoot the original Day o f Rest (Seventh Day Sabbath). Sunday worship is not a Commandment from the Bible, but a commandment found on the pages of most astrological heathen religions. It was Lucifer, \"The Shining One,\" whom the ignorant Sun worshippers bowed to and so is it today. The Sun is just a cam ouflage the Devil hides behind to get the people of the world to turn their backs to the Real Creator. And so is it with the observance of Sunday. Sunday tradition is an invention of Sata n himself. Jesus of Nazareth said He is the \"Lord of the Sabbath,\" not Sunday. See Ma rk 2:27, 28. However, nobody has received the Mark of the Beast as yet. The Universal forced Sunday observ ance law is still in the near future. There shall be multitudes of Sunday observers who died in Christ in Heaven. The controversy b etween Sunday and the Seventh Da y Sabbath is an issue that wi ll be settled in these latte r times. Just before Jesus of Nazareth comes fo r his people, all the doc trines that were lost"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"during the 1260 year Papal apos tasy will be presented befo re those who call themselves Christians. When the truth about the Sevent h Day Sabbath is brought out in the light, multitudes of sincere Sunday keepers will begin to ask their religious leaders where in the Word of God is the Commandmen t to observe Sunday! This will stir up a controversy in both Christianity and in the Pagan Re ligions. While worldly Christians try to find excuses to ignore the call for Sabbath reform, a small group of sin cere Christians from al l faiths will hear what the Spirit is saying unto the churches and will obey the call from God to: \"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt t hou labour, and do all thy work: But the Seventh Day is the Sabbath of th e Lord thy God: In it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy da ughter, thy manserva nt, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested th e Seventh day: Wherefor e the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.\" Exodus 20:8-11 Sunday worship is part of the wine of her fornication (Fal se Doctrines) that has made the whole world intoxicated with fa lse religions. Witchcraft (Spiri tualism), the powerful force o f Lucifer's might, will reach its peak shortly. The Fa ther of Lies will pour out every conceivable sign and lying wonder to gather the ignorant against those who will not sanction Sunday. \"Babylon the Great\" of Revelati on the 17th chapter is a symbol of all the religions of the world united together under a New World Religion. This Ne w World Religion which will have both Roman Catholic and Protestant moveme nts, will unite with Spiritualism. This New Age Movement calling for a New World Religion wi ll also call for a Universal Day of Rest. This day will be Sunday. And it will soon be a cr iminal offense with the pain of death, if not sanctioned. It has been foretold and it will come to pass. We should not ignore however, what Mary Stewart Relfe, Ph.D., is trying to show he r readers. The Bible clearly states that the true followers of Jesus of Nazareth will suffe r p ersecution in these closing days . \"And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the Mark, or the Name of the Beast, or the Number of his Name.\" (666) Revelation 13:17. Even though Mary Stewart Relfe, Ph.D., ha s the Universal Product C ode mixed up as being the Mark of the Beast, nevertheless, the Bible ma kes it very plain that the followers of Jesus of Nazareth will not be able to buy or sell either, unless they accept the Number (666) of the Beast. We should not ignore this universal plan to introduce a World Wide Credit Card, o r Money Card, with its International Code as being 666. We thank Mary Stewart Relfe for he r efforts in trying to make slee ping Christians to become awar e and behold what Satan is doing today. Like Constance Cumbey's, The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow , we recommend the reader possess a copy of Mary Stewar t Relfe's Book, The New Money System. Whether or not World Commerce will be conducted by a cashless system for exchanging goods by using a Universal Credit Ca rd still remains to be see n. However, the sad truth about this whole Antichrist movement is that the Bi ble predicts that most people living in these latter days will be deceived and lost by it. Why will multitudes of Christians be deceived? Again, the Scriptures remind us: \"My p eople are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me seeing thou hast forgotte n the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.\" Hosea 4:6. We must know the issues for ourselves . We must have a firm knowledge and belief in Jesus Christ and His Holy Sc riptures!! The religion of As trology is predicting a Utopian World Government will be esta blished in the New Age of A quarius. Lucifer and his people are trying to condition the world to unite together so peace and safety will come. In the name of Peace and Love does this gr eat delusion go forth. However, Paul the Apostle of Jesus o f N azareth foretold: \"For when they shall say pe ace and Safety, then s udden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; a nd they shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thie f. Ye are all the children o f"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"light: We are not of the night, nor of darkness.\" 1.Thessalonians 5:3-5. There will never be peace in this present evil world until Satan, His angels, and his people are destroyed by Jesus of Nazareth. Terrible will it be for those in this world who rejected the Love of Jesus. Revelation 6:15 fo retells how those who reject Jesus of Naza reth will feel at his Second Coming. \"And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of th e mountains: And said to the mo untains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lord. For the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?\" Jesu s will not set up His kingdom in this present evil world. Jesus pl ainly states: \"My kingdom is not of this world: If my kingdom were of this world, then w ould my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: But now is my kingdom not from hence.\" John 18:36. It will be Lucifer himself, personating Jesus, that w ill deceive the very elect if possible into b elieving that long looked for Kingdom of God has come upon th e earth. Lucifer himself will p ersonate Jesus of Nazareth just before the real Christ comes with all His angels. This has been foretold and it will come to pass. There is hardly a Christian Church toda y that hasn't already been deceived by the false doctrine of a 1000 year reign of Christ on earth. The 1000 year re ign of Christ is foretold in Revelation 20:1-10. Jesus of Naza reth will not meet His peopl e on this earth. We are to meet Him in the Air. 1.Thessalonian s 4:16, 17. The 1000 year reign is in Heaven, not on earth. What are we to do to escape the sudden dest ruction that will sure ly come upon the world? First, make sure you have made peace with G od through Jesus of Nazareth. \"And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkeness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye theref ore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these th ings that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.\" Luke 21:34, 36. \"Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat , they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and b rimstone from Heaven, and destr oyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.\" Luke 17:28-30. The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were onl y a shadow in ancient times of how the whole world was predicted from Scriptur es to become. Our Lord is just as surely calling His people out of the cities and heavil y populated areas today, as He called Lot and hi s family out. We are to flee the cities!! We are to get out in th e rural areas where a plot of land can be used to grow our own food. The cities a nd heavily populated areas will be thrown into a world-wide Reign of Terror. The citi es will become blood baths. The Ark of safety for Christians is to buy a piece of land as far away from the cities and heavily populated areas as possible. Those who are like Lot's wife that cannot give up worldy pleasures will also fall victim as the heathen, i f they do not listen. Our Lord's council fo r us today is found in the prophesies of Isaiah 26: 20-21. \"Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambe rs, and shut thy doors about thee: Hide thysel f as it were for a little moment, until the indi gnation be overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of His place to punish the i nhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: The earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.\" We are living in the last era of the earth's hist ory. It will end with Jesus' Second Coming. \"And to you who are troubled rest with us, wh en the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fi re taking vengeance on th em that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glor y of His power\" 2.Thessalonians 1:7-9."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" \"Seek ye the Lord wh ile He may be found, call ye upon Hi m while He is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and th e unrighteous man his thoughts: And let him return unto the Lord, and He will have merc y upon him; And to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.\" Isaiah 55:6, 7.
