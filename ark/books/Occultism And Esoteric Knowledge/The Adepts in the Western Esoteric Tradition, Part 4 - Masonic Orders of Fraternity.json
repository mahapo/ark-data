The guilds, trade unions, and similar protective and benevolent Societies had been internally strengthened by the introduction of a new learning. The advancement of the plan required the enlargement of the boundaries of the philosophic overstate. A World Frater- nity was needed, sustained by a deep and broad program of education according to the \"method.\" Such a Fraternity could not immediately include all men, but it could uriite the activities of certain kinds of men, regardless of their racial or religious beliefs or the nations in which they dwelt. These were the men of \"towardness,\" those sons of to- morrow, whose symbol was a blazing sun rising over the mountains of the east. While it is difficult to trace the elements of a pattern never intended to be obvious, the broad shape of the design is dimly apparent. The Invisible Empire, integrated and ensouled by Bacon and his so-called literary group, was the archetype of those democratic Societies which directly and indirectly precipitated the era of revolution. Thus, the way was cleared for the first great experiments in practical self-government. Much more was required than a state- ment of human rights. It was necessary to prepare the individual to administer such rights. There can be no enduring freedom for those who cannot protect liberty with intelligence. It is not enough that a man have rights; the man himself must be right. 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 THE ADEPTS It was inevitable that the Orders of Fraternity should sponsor world education. The human mind must be en- riched in essential knowledge and be freed from the burdens of ignorance, superstition, and fear. The program included a systematic expansion of existing institutions and the en- largement of their spheres of influence. Slowly, the Orders of Universal Reformation faded from public attention, and in their places appeared the Orders of World Brotherhood. Everything possible was done to prevent the transitions from being obvious. Even history was falsified to make certain sequences of activity unrecog- nizable. The shift of emphasis never gave the impression of abruptness, and the motion appeared as a dawning of social consciousness. The most obvious clues to the secret activity have been the prevailing silence about the origin and the impossibility of filling the lacunae in the records of 17th- and 18th-century fraternal Orders. It is usual to consider fraternal Orders as merely Societies of good fellowship, but fraternity actually implies much more. The brotherhood of man must become a social reality before the New Atlantis can exist as an ideal com- monwealth in this world. Without fraternity, all the larger benevolences of mankind come to nothing. There can be no enduring security, no lasting peace, no practical co- operation between the classes of society or the sovereign States of the political sphere without the conviction that all men share a common heritage of opportunity and re- sponsibility. The \"method\" must first give birth through time to an ideological empire without physical boundaries, composed of citizens of a certain quality, a common vision, and a mutual purpose.

In spite of every adversity and impediment, the advance of the human estate was inevitable. It was, indeed, the way of heaven unfolding in the sphere of human society through the machinery of the Mysteries and their adepts. The era of exploration revealed a vast continent in the Western Hemisphere suitable for colonization and ideal for the political experiment of democracy. By circumstances which appear more than fortuitous, Lord Bacon was a member of the Virginia Company, which included several illustrious names associated with the Baconian literary group. His lordship was also an organizing spirit in the whole English colonization scheme. It is evident from his writings that he regarded America as an ideal location for his Philosophic Commonwealth. That he proceeded to advance his program by practical means is evident from reports available to any interested historian. During the formative period of Colonial growth, numer- ous Baconian landmarks were set up as monuments to the enterprise. Even through the Revolutionary period, Amer- ican patriots worked hand in hand with members of English and European Secret Societies. It may require an exten- sive research to reveal the details of the well-laid plan, but the general workings of the design are reasonably obvious. Bacon carefully prepared a model for those who succeeded him, bestowing upon them not only a legacy of learning, but also a code of orderly procedure.

In the present section of this outline of the adept tradition is set forth the culmination of the European phase. The Masonic Orders of Fraternity acted as media for the dis- semination of the high doctrines of liberty, equality, and fraternity. They supported, with their private means and their moral strength, those patriots fighting for liberty in Colonial America. Some, like Junius, concealed their identities and have never been positively identified. Others, like Lafayette and Kosciusko, committed their names and reputations to the cause without reservations. Now that the practical advantages of secrecy have ceased, it is proper that the citizens of the United States of America and the British Commonwealth of Nations should realize, at least, the broad outline of the plan underlying the significant political and social changes which dominated the life of the 18th century.

The disagreements of learned authorities over the descent of the operative and speculative traditions of the Craft need not be examined here. Societies of skilled arti- sans, addicted to those arts and sciences concerned with architecture and ornamentation, certainly have flourished from the beginning of historical time. Possibly such asso- ciations originated in the ancient practice of perpetuating the secrets of a profession or trade within families. According to 18th-century Masonic tradition, Rome gathered the most eminent professors and practitioners of the arts and sciences \". . . until they advanced to their Zenith of Glory, under AUGUSTUS CAESAR, (in whose Reign was born God's MESSIAH, the great Architect of the Church) who having laid the World quiet, by pro- claiming universal Peace, highly encourag'd those dexter- ous Artists that had been bred in the Roman Liberty, and their learned Scholars and Pupils; but particularly the great VITRUVIUS, the Father of all true Architects to this Day. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 THE ADEPTS \"Therefore it IS rationally believ'd, that the glorious AUGUSTUS became the Grand-Master of the Lodge at Rome, having, besides his patronizing Vitruvius, much pro- moted the Welfare of the Fellow-Craftsmen, as appears by the many magnificent Buildings of his Reign, etc.\"* After the collapse of the Roman College of Architects, the splendid tradition of the builders passed to the keeping of the great Order of Comacine Masters, which flourished during the reigns of Constantine and Theodosius. The M agistri Comacini was composed of members of the Roman collegia, who, escaping from the barbarians when they overran the Empire, established themselves on the fortified island of Comacini, in Lake Como. Here they preserved the secret traditions of architecture and the machinery of the Roman guilds. They were responsible for the develop- ment of early Lombard and Romanesque styles of ornamen- tation. The Comacines were divided into Masters and disciples, and were ruled by a Grand Master. Their meet- ing places were called Logia. They wore white aprons and gloves, and had signs, tokens, passwords, and other means of identification. The Four Crowned Martyrs were the patron saints of the Comacine builders. These martyrs were members of the College of Architects, in Rome, during the reign of Diocletian. They had been converted to Christianity, and steadfastly refused to fashion a statue of Aesculapius. These Masters and one apprentice were tortured to death by order of the emperor. The Four Crowned Martyrs, carrying builders' instruments, were pictured or referred to in many early religious and Masonic writings, including the Re gius MS. The Quatuor Coronati Lodge, London, the most dis- tinguished Masonic research group, was named in honor of these martyrs.

While it is difficult to prove the historical descent of an initiate Order of adept-architects, Heckethorn sum- marizes the situation with reasonable accuracy: In antiq- uity there were corporations of architects and engineers, who undertook the building of temples and stadia; the 'Dionysiacs' in Greece, the 'Collegium Muriorum' in Rome were such. They were the prototypes of the associations of masons, builders, carpenters, who in the Middle Ages flourished chiefly in Germany and England. These, some- times numbering six to eight hundred members, made con- tracts with monks, chapters, and other ecclesiastical author- ities for the erection of cathedrals or churches. Eventually they made themselves independent of the Church, and in the thirteenth century they formed an extensive building association, originating at Cologne, and having lodges, as they called the directing members, at Strasbourg, Vienna, Cologne, and Zurich. There were other lodges, but these were the most important. They called themselves Free masons, and had ceremonies of initiation. Toward the end of the sixteenth century non-operative masons were ad- mitted into the fraternity, who were called 'accepted' Masons; they included men distinguished for learning or high position. Thus the work in the lodges became more symbolical than operative.\"* Assemblies of men specially skilled in architecture de- scended from antiquity and flourished in both Europe and Asia. These guilds of artisans were called upon whenever it was resolved to build new cities, to erect monumental structures, or to restore or enlarge shrines, temples, and palaces. Originally, these artisans migrated in groups of various numbers, according to the requirements of the ·See Secret Societies of All Ages."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 THE ADEPTS occasion. They gathered wherever an elaborate archi- tectural project was in process, and moved on to new locales when the work was finished. According to Huges, Arch- bishop of Rouen, numerous companies of such masons, under the leadership of a chief whom they called a prince, were traveling about Normandy restoring churches in the year 1145. He also mentioned that these artificers held an important guild union at Chartes, which was a splendid affair. It was considered indelicate to inquire into the secrets of these associations of builders. Apparently they combined religious and philosophical speculations with the more prosaic rules of construction. The normal boundaries of prevailing racial and religious prejudices were relaxed in favor of these skilled bands of craftsmen, who were per- mitted to live according to their natural instincts and preferences while laboring in various districts and countries. Great edifices, such as the cathedral churches, often re- quired centuries to complete. Thus several generations of artisans were employed on a single project, and the camps or towns which they established contiguous to their work became comparatively permanent communities. Like the gypsies, these bands of wandering craftsmen never mingled with other people. If some feudal lord wished to enlarge his castle or build a church, his desires were circulated quietly but thoroughly by the Troubadours or other wandering entertainers. Short- ly, a body of Freemasons assembled near the prospective site. These men immediately placed themselves under the rule of a Master elected from among their number, and he, in turn, nominated one man out of every ten as a warden. First, they erected temporary huts for their own use, and then a central Lodge for their meetings. Sometimes they stipulated that the townsfolk should provide tiles to roof"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 13 this Lodge, also white aprons of a peculiar kind of leather and gloves to protect their hands from lime and stone. The craftsmen assembled in their Lodge at the beginning of each day's work, and, if they required rough labor from the vicinity, they did not admit these workmen to the principal assembly.* The members of these associations of builders were governed by their own duly elected chiefs. Frequently they gave no allegiance to the temporal power which paid their wages. The workmen brought with them not only their families and worldly goods, but also their cultural institutions. These remained comparatively uninfluenced by outside pressures, for not infrequently the workmen did not even speak the dialect of the area in which they labored. The chiefs, or Lodge Masters, contracted to perform and complete the program of work, and often certain skilled men among them also designed the building or corrected and revised plans submitted to them by the ecclesiastical or civil authorities. Thus it carne about that the early Church employed pagan artisans or those of doubtful orthodoxy when some elaborate structure was required. So great was the power of these builders' associations and so urgently was their skill required that it was deemed advisable to ignore re- ligious nonconformity. Probably, the issue was never raised, at least publicly, as the artificers assumed an outward appearance of conformity and declined to disclose any of their secret beliefs or convictions. These Fraternities of craftsmen were privately addicted to the doctrines of Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, and Manichaeanism. Later, they were influenced by the Lollards and the much-perse- cuted Templars. But, like the Troubadours, they had learned discretion in the school of sad experience. ·See Frccm asonry and the Ancient Gods, by J. s. M. Ward (London, 1921)."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 THE ADEPTS Men can learn by observation, and early monks with naturalaptitudes were able, by degrees, to absorb the essen- tial principles of the science of architecture. At first, these clerics only attempted structures of minor importance, but as their skill increased they fraternized with the older asso- ciations and, having given evidence of merit and proficiency, in some instances were actually initiated. This new Order of monastic artisans imbibed some of the old philosophy along with the more practical aspects of the Craft, and became perpetuators of the old learning in its twofold descent as theory and practice. In Saxon and Norman England, a number of early priests have been identified as architects and masons. These Christian builders perpetuated the apprenticeship system of the ancient Orders as the most practical means of pre- serving the high standards of the building arts. It is diffi- cult at this late time to differentiate between such Christian and non-Christian guilds of masons, and it is doubtful if much would be accomplished by reopening the issue. Names change, but the principles continue without notice- able alteration. Traces of Secret Societies can be discovered among the ruins of aboriginal cultures, and such groups still flourish among primitive peoples. Numerous authors have attempt- ed to show that these cults used symbols and rituals similar to those found in Freemasonry. The writings of Augustus LePlongeon, especially his Sacred M'ysteries Among the Mayas and Quiches, and the researches of James Church- ward, as set forth in Signs and Symbols of Primordial M an, are examples of this approach.

In fact. it has not been possible to prove to the complete satisfaction of skeptics that any body of abstract or esoteric lore was directly transmitted from the early collegia to the modem Fraternity. There must be more than shows on the surface, but unless the Masonic historian is aware of the essential substance of the adept tradition, he will find the facts ex- tremely elusive. The deficiencies of history have resulted in the popular belief that Freemasonry is a modem Society, tied to antiquity only by the fortuitous adoption of certain ancient signs and symbols. Working guilds, such as the cathedral builders, took a lively interest in religious, political, and social issues outside the strict limits of their crafts. The artificers had enjoyed extraordinary privileges of self-government for more than twenty centuries. Within their own groups, they had de- veloped a merit system of mutual co-operation and protec- tion in sharp contrast with the corruptions everywhere obvious in the conduct of civil affairs. They had attained to a practical democracy for themselves, while Europe was still in bondage to economic and political feudalism. There can be no doubt that the guilds cherished the spirit of real democracy and became proficient in the operations of what is now called the merit system, long before it was generally recognized as a possible political pattern. Joseph Fort Newton held that Freemasonry did not evolve from guild masonry. He writes: \"Free-masons existed in large numbers long before any city guild of Masons was formed, and even after the Guilds became powerful the two were entirely distinct.\"* This author be- lieved that the guilds were Fraternities by voluntary com- \"See The Builders (Cedar Rapids, 1916, and other dates)."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 THE ADEPTS pact, characterized by the common banquet and the com- mon purse. He acknowledged, however, that they also had a religious and sometimes a secret ceremonial to knit more firmly the bonds of fidelity. According to him, the Free- masons were a superior group that occasionally hired rough masons from the guilds as hewers of wood and carriers of water. This attitude assumes that the guilds were little more than trade or labor unions-benevolent and pro- tective associations. This may have been true after the guilds were settled in the community life of Europe and England, and the stolid burghers met in the guildhalls to regulate their re- spective trades. By that time, most of the esoteric lore survived only as a vague symbolism, but the guilds) as respectable trade associations, were the terminal forms of ancient and honorable institutions of initiates. The English Miracle Plays were mentioned by Dugdale in his History of Warwickshire, published in 1656. Such details as he was able to secure were given to him by aged persons who still remembered the plays which they had seen in their younger years. The importance of the pageants given on Corpus Christi Day may be inferred from the quality of the audience. Richard III attended in 1483, and Henry VII and his queen in 1492. Apparently, the pageants were no longer presented in the time of Dugdale. The Miracle Plays, sometimes presented by the Grey Friars and sometimes by the local guilds, originated in the rituals of the Greek Mysteries. These were revived in Rome, and Christian stories were later substituted for the myths of the pagan gods. Such theatrical performances were morality dramas rather than historical accounts, and supplied a pattern for the ritualistic presentations now associated with the initiation rites of Secret Societies."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 17 Concerning these religious plays presented in England at any early date, Thomas Sharp writes: \"Besides the Mysteries exhibited by the monks of Chester and Coventry, there were in both cities certain sacred histories regularly performed by, and at the expense of, the members of the trade-guilds established in them; each society generally -From Old England (London, 185'!)

It seems possible that rituals later associated with the degrees of Freemasonry may have been suggested by these guild dramas. . If so, the building of Solomon's Temple would have been a most appropriate theme for the companies of stonemasons. Even after the guilds had been integrated into the social structure of early modern Europe, they still practiced a code of ethics in advance of their time. In a limited way, but with a considerable sphere of quiet influence, these Societies, unions, and crafts sponsored progress and liberal enterprise. Protective associations were also formed to maintain fair standards of merchandising and to protect their members and the members of affiliate organizations from unfair business practices. While this side of the sub- ject has been emphasized, the pattern of internal govern- ment which became a model for a larger social experiment in the political sphere should not be overlooked. At least some guild masons were aware that their ancient brethren practiced their crafts as forms of religious worship. The ethical symbolism of modern Freemasonry which inter- prets the processes of architecture as representing the up- building of human character was shared by the medieval artificers. In an anonymous work, titled The Echo of the Divinely Illuminated Fraternity of the R. C., published in 1615, appears the statement that \"Christ established a new College of Magic among his disciples, and the Greater Mysteries were revealed to St. John and St. Paul.\" Dr. Robert Fludd mentioned that the Rosicrucians were wise men who, like architects, erected their House of Wisdom. The Talmud states that \"wise-men are called builders be- cause they are always engaged in the upbuilding of the world.\" The members of the Essene sect among the Jews \"See Dissertation on the Pageants, or Dramatic Mysteries, anciently performed at (;ovmt'·y by the Trading Companies of that City (Coventry, 1825)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 19 were called Bonaim, or builders, because it was their duty to edify or perfect the spiritual temple in the body of man. It cannot be assumed that the building associations were entirely unaware of their religious, ethical, and moral obli- gations. While the secrets of the esoteric tradition may have been in the keeping of an overgroup, the guild crafts- men certainly represented the material aspect of a spiritual conviction. John Yarker, who held important Masonic offices and received many high honors from the Craft, crams much useful information into a sentence of heroic proportions: \"We cannot doubt ... that the Epoptae, or higher Initiates, of the first ages of Christianity, transmitted their Mystical Rites; these were taken up and carried for- ward by Monks, Dervishes, Manichees, Catharoi, Ternplars, Albigensis, Ghibellines, Friends of God, Militia of the Cross, Rosicrucians, and sects too numerous to mention; and that such secret Schools were in existence long prior to the Reformation in the church, as witness the labours of such men as Fiscini, Pico de Mirandolo, Reuchlin, Erasmus, Agrippa, Rudolphus Agricolo, and many more, and that educated Free Masons, in their Masters' Fra- ternities and Fellowcraft Lodges, were more or less con- versant with Pythagoreanism, Platonism, Cabalism, Rosi- crucianism, and that these Societies interested themselves in Germany and elsewhere in the spread of the doctrine of the Culdees, of Wycliffe, Huss, Luther, and other Re- formers, and the Secret Society established by Cornelius Agrippa in London, in 1510, may have been of this nature.\"* Most of the organized craftsmen of the Middle Ages were nominal Christians, in many respects outstanding for their personal piety and devotion. They differed principally in ·See The Arcane Schools (Belfast, 1909)."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 THE ADEPTS the degree and quality of their interpretations of the Chris- tian dispensation. In a day of almost continuous strife and conspiracy, they dwelt together in co-operation and amity. These associations had discovered a working formula for the practice of liberty, equality, and charity. The guilds continued as important forces in character building until machine production terminated the apprenticeship system. These conscientious and dedicated craftsmen devised and practiced an ethical code which became a design, or trestle board, for the Accepted Masons who followed them. In philosophic Masonry, Master Builders, inspired by the symbols of fraternity, resolved to perfect the Everlasting House of human brotherhood. The true spirit of modern Masonry arose when these guild artisans first recognized the possibility of applying the rules of the architectural unions and other trade guilds to society in general. For this reason no exact dating is possible; rather there was a gradual emergence of a sincere conviction into the light of a larger sphere of usefulness. The Protestant Reformation contributed a great deal to the growth of the democratic ideals, and received, in its turn, comfort and security from at least the spirit of the guilds. Yarker suggests that Secret Schools, broadly Gnostic in their convictions, must have permeated the whole of Europe and entered into the guild life of the traders and artisans; otherwise it is impossible to account for the spon- taneous support given to the Reformation. \"It is supposed,\" writes Yarker, \"that Luther himself was a Guild member and he actually uses Guild terms in 1527, when he says that he is 'already passed-Master in clock- making.' It is stated that about 15 days after the holocaust which he had the temerity to make of the Pope's Bull, he was waited upon by a member of some Guild holding a meeting at Wittemberg, and induced to go to an Assembly"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 21 at the Guild Hall, where after Reception 'by ancient cere- monies,' he received a medal bearing Mystic characters, and was then placed under the protection of the brother- hood. It is quite certain that Secret Societies of Mystics, united by ceremonies with signs, then existed; and it may be that the Reformers strengthened themselves by such So- cieties, intended for mutual protection, and the Charter of Cologne, 1535, if genuine, may represent such Assemblies.\"* After the Reformation, Europe passed through a critical transition period. Traditional authority was seriously un- dermined, and the masses were divided in their allegiances between fear of the old and hope for the new. The partner- ship between the Church and State, having lost much of its prestige, was unable to dominate, much less destroy, the new convictions everywhere revealing themselves. The Protestant denominations shared many of the concepts which had been fostered by the guilds, so these two groups drifted into closer sympathy, causing a demarkation be- tween the forces of reaction and innovation in the spheres of both religious and social convictions. This summary of an elaborate and extensive process is sufficient to introduce the rise of philosophic or speculative Masonry as distinguished from the operative guilds. His- torians assume the shift of foundations to have occurred about the year 1600, although it required some time to clarify and integrate the new concepts. The dawn of the 17th century, a time so burdened with great and significant motions, was the birthtime of Accepted Masonry. The burden of progress was shifted from the physical to the ethical level, and the builders of temples became the build- ers of man's democratic destiny. *Derived from National Freeni., (Washington, 1863); Row's Masonic Biographies (1868); and Canadian Craftsman (1893)."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 THE ADEPTS Elias Ashmole, Esq.

Mr. William Lilly, the leading astrologer of the day, later recti- fied the nativity of his friend Ashmole and decided that the exact time, due to the discrepancy between local clocks, was three hours twenty-five minutes and nine seconds A.

These assemblies have been dismissed by most authorities as con- ventions of the credulous. There are grounds, however, for suspecting that the astronomers were concerned with more serious business than fan-tailed comets. Christopher Frederick Nicolai* summarizes the aim and purpose of the Society of Astrologers thus: \"Its object was to build the House of Solomon, of the New Atlantis, in the literal sense, but the establishment was to remain as secret as the island of Bensalem-that is to say, they were to be engaged in the study of Nature-but the instruction of its principles was to remain in the society in an esoteric form. These philosophers presented their idea in a strictly allegorical method. First, there were the ancient columns of Hermes, by which Iamblichus pretended that he had enlightened all the doubts of Porphyry. You then mounted, by several steps, to a chequered floor, divided into four regions, to denote the four superior sciences; after which came the types of the six days' work, which expressed the object of the society, and which were the same as those found on an engraved stone in my possession.\" Mackey was of the same mind when he wrote: \"But the more immediate effect of the romance of Bacon was the institution of the Society of Astrologers, of which Elias Ashmole was a leading member.\" This Masonic historian adds that the astrologers met at Masons' Hall because many of the members were also members of the Masons' Com- pany.

In Ashmole's diary, there are direct references to Free- masonry, including the dates of his own meetings with the brethren: Oct. 16, 1646 At four thirty P. M. Ashmole was made a Freemason at Warrington, in Lancashire. March 10, 1682 He received a summons to appear at a Lodge to be held the next day at Masons' Hall, in London. March 11, 1682 He went about noon, and was admitted to the \"Fellowship of Freemasons\" by Sir William Wilson, Kt. Five other Brothers were mentioned by name.

Robert Freke Gould quotes the following from a letter written to him by Albert Pike: \"I cannot conceive of any- thing that could have induced Ashmole, Mainwaring, and other men of their class to unite themselves with a lodge of working Masons, except this-that as the Alchemists, Hermeticists, and Rosicrucians had no association of (their) own in England or Scotland, they joined the Masonic lodges in order to meet one another without being suspected; and 1 am convinced that it was the men who inherited their doctrine who brought their symbols into Masonry, but kept the Hermetic meanings of them to themselves. To these men we owe, 1 believe, the Master's degree. The substi- tute word means 'the Creative Energy from the father'- the Demiourgos, and Hiram, 1 think, was made the hero, because his name resembled Hermes, 'The Master of the Lodge;' the Divine Word (the Egyptian Thoth), the Mercury of the Alchemists.\"* The initiation of Elias Ashmole has long been considered an important Masonic landmark, and he is often referred to as the first gentleman not associated with the building arts to be accepted into the Craft. As he made no mention of the three degrees of the Blue Lodge, it is assumed that they did not exist in his time. Ashmole's huge volume, Order of the Garter, proved beyond question his ability as a historian, and it was reported that he contemplated a work of equal proportion on the ancient Society of Free- masons. Unfortunately, the design was never perfected, but he left intimations that a considerable history worth ·Sec Masonic Celebrities: Albert Pike, by Robert Freke Gould, reprinted from Ars Qtlattlor Coronatorum,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"compiling existed. To what degree these records related only to guild masonry is uncertain, but there was a tradition to the effect that from the time of St. Alban (4th century A. D.) charters and other extraordinary marks of royal favor were bestowed upon the builders. Its affairs, however, did not always run smoothly, for in the third year of the reign of King Henry VI (1421-1471), the Society of Masons was abolished by an act of Parliament. Yet, even before this act was repealed, the king and several of his principal courtiers became Fellows of the Order. * As the king or his nobles were not practicing stonemasons, it is evident that certain persons were \"accepted\" prior to Ashmole. The philosopher, John Locke, published in 1753 the copy of an English document believed to have been written by King Henry VI. It refers directly to Masonry, and contains the following curious fragment: Question: Where did Masonry begin? Answer: It began with the first men of the East, who existed before the first men of the We<;t, and, going westward, Masonry brought all com- forts to the ignorant savages who were not awake to these things. Ashmole associated with astrologers, alchemists, and Freemasons, and the regard in which he was held is evident from the number of books and pamphlets dedicated to him. In 1650, he published the Fasciculus C hemicus, by Dr. Arthur Dee, the son of the learned old John Dee. With this tract was combined a similar one by an unknown author. In the midst of the Masonic muddle of that period, therefore, a group of men, remembered only by the general public as horoscope-mongers and almanac-peddlers, were MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 31 \"This research was contained in a letter written by Dr. Knipe of Christ Church, Oxford, and addressed to the publisher of Ashrnole's Life.

Thomas Vaughan, the alchemist, seems also to have had Masonic affiliations. The accompanying figure, from Occulta Philosophic (edition of 1613), belongs in a series of engravings pre- pared to illustrate the chemical secrets of Basil Valentine. The symbol is described as representing the materia prima, or the first matter of the Stone. The two-headed human figure, bearing the tablet inscribed Rebis (rebus, a kind of pictorial riddle), holds in one hand a compass, and in the other, a square. General Pike,\" describing this device, writes that the compass \"as the symbol of the Heavens, represents the spiritual, intellectual, and moral portion of this double nature of Humanity; and the square, as the symbol of the Earth, its material, sensual, and baser portion.\" The arrangement indicates that the compass takes the place of the sun, and the square substitutes for the moon. The union of these two instruments in three positions, in the three degrees of the Blue Lodge, therefore equal or stand for the Hermetic marriage of the sun and moon. The symbols and allegories of the Hermetic Societies contributed to the moral and spiritual enrichment of 17th-century English Freemasonry, and prepared the. way for the new Masonry revealed in the following century through the literary activ- ities of Drs. Anderson and Desaguliers. John Aubrey, antiquary and Fellow of the Royal Society, wrote his memo ires between 1656 and 1691, but they were not published until 1847 under the title, The Natural His- tory of Wiltshire. Aubrey alluded to a great convention of Accepted M asons to be held at St. Paul's Church, May 18, 1691, at which time Sir Christopher Wren. the celebrated architect, was to be adopted as a Brother.

The vision and the concept were Dionysiac, but a Christian world, steeped in Biblical tradition, selected a temple from its own sacred writings rather than some sanctuary of pagan Mysteries. In I. Kings, 7: 13, 14, it is said that King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. This man was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was of Tyre and a worker in brass. This Hiram was filled with wisdom and understanding and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to King Solomon and wrought all his works. In II. Chronicles, 2: 13, 14, it is Hiram, King of Tyre, who sent a cunning workman, the son of a woman of the daugh- ters of Dan. This Hiram, the builder, was skillful to work in gold and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber; in purple, in blue, in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving; and to find out every device which shall be put to him. Tyre was one of the chief seats of the Dionysiac Fraternity of Builders. It is possible that Hiram was a member of this Fraternity, and on his arrival at Jerusalem he instituted similar rules of government among the Jewish workmen about B. C. 1012. He received the title of Principal Con- ductor of the Works; and if he were not the same as Adoniram, he succeeded him in the office next to the two kings and formed the third person in the Supreme Council of Grand Masters. * The Third Degree of Freemasonary seems to have been introduced in the year 1717, although Ragon suggests a date between 1640 and 1660.

Certainly the slight and insignificant references contained in the Bible do not sup- port the Masonic version of the legend. Although the story of Hiram was accepted as a historical account in the works of both Dr. Anderson (1662-1739) and Dr. Desaguliers ( 1683-1749), it had received no notice from earlier writers. Dr. James Anderson was a Presbyterian minister. The date of his initiation into the Masonic Order is unknown, but he revised the Gothic constitutions by order of the Grand Lodge; and his work, titled The Constitutions ot the Freemasons, etc., issued in 1723, is a significant land- mark. Dr. John Theopholius Desaguliers was a distin- guished writer and physicist, and a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was a friend of Sir Isaac Newton, and was initiated into a Lodge which met at the Goose and Grid- iron in St. Paul's churchyard. Through the assistance of Sir Christopher Wren, he was instrumental in the forming of the Grand Lodge in 1717, and had the honor of initiating the Prince of Wales. Dr. Desaguliers devoted most of his life to the advancement of his fellow man, but died in obscurity and extreme poverty, having achieved fame but no substantial material benefits from his industry.

Smith, in his Dictionary of the Bible) writes: \"Perhaps no building of the ancient world . . . has excited so much attention since the time of its destruction, as the Temple of Solomon built in Jerusalem, and its successor as built by Herod.

The time of its emergence has been mistaken for the date of its invention. General Albert Pike, whose Masonic scholar- ship was prodigious, favored the hypothesis that certain \"men of intelligence,\" especially Drs. Anderson and Desa- guliers, were responsible for the creation and introduction of the Third Degree of Masonry, at least in its modern form. Dr. Mackey, another researcher of distinction, con- sidered Desaguliers to be the father of modern speculative Masonry, and several others among the historians of the Craft have insisted that Anderson and Desaguliers manu- factured the Degree. * \"For details, consult The Builders, by Joseph Fort Newton, and Ahiman Rezon, by Dermott."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38 THE ADEPTS In describing the symbolical Masonry of the early 17th century, Dr. Newton, who professes to be a student of the great mystics, favors mysticism but not mystification.

Through Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Christopher Wren, Dr. Desaguliers was associated with a descent of esoteric tradition from Bacon's Secret Society and his phantom College of the Six Days Work, described in the New Atlantis. Desaguliers, as a Fellow of the Royal Society, must have been aware of the Society of Unknown Philosophers and other mystical associations of the preceding century.

As the pattern unfolds, the presence of invisible but powerful pressures can be sensed, if not fully seen, in the sudden enrichment of the mystical and symbolical side of Freemasonry and in the elaboration and beautification of its rituals. The Hiramic legend certainly originated in at least a sober reflection upon the sacred dramas of the ancient Mysteries. There are parallels with the Osirian Rites of the later Egyptians, and the treatment of the material sug- gests the type of interpretation of Egyptian religious institu- tions current among the advanced European intellectuals of the 17th century. A number of Societies revived rituals and symbols pertaining to the earlier pagan institutions. Much alike in spirit and remarkably similar in form, it is unlikely that these productions were completely independ- ent and spontaneous. It is more reasonable that they emerged from a common source which remained, and con- tinues to remain, concealed. The effort to show that the Hiramic legend is a veiled exposition of Christian mysticism and morality is not con- vincing, though it has many devout adherents. The martyr- dom of the builder suggests rather what Sir John Frazer calls \"the myth of the dying god.\" Even the elaborate cabalistic legends do not advance the Christian hypothesis.

It seems as though the guilds and trade unions were drawn into the pattern of esoteric descent as peculiarly suitable vehicles to advance the cause of the long-projected Philo- sophic Empire. It may be found when the rubble has been cleared away that Francis Bacon was the instigator of this significant project, and, after him, those who were party to his program advanced and perfected the work. Several ancient groups were \"raised\" by his lordship and received from him the Word of Power, \"lip to ear.\" Unless we are aware of the adept tradition, we are inclined to accept that which is too obvious to be consistent with the dignity of the facts.

The condition of Freemasonry during the Elizabethan period can be estimated with some accuracy from scattered references.

D.: \"Queen Elizabeth, indignant that the Freemasons had not offered the Grand Mastership to her consort during his lifetime, on the 27th of December of this year, ordered the dissolution of the Masonic assembly which on that day commenced its semi-annual meeting, and ordered the execution of her edict to be enforced by a detachment of armed men; but, upon a report having been made to her by the commanding officer of the detach- ment expressive of the politically harmless character of the assembly, the Queen revoked her order.

In his writings, Bacon revealed a profound interest in several branches of learning associated with both speculative and operative Masonry, and stated directly that he desired to be considered an architect of arts and sciences. Masonic scholars have acknowledged that Bacon's New Atlantis inspired broad reforms in education, a program symbolized by the perfecting of \"King Salomon's House,\" an allegory very close to the hearts of Masons. His Lord- ship's inclinations toward secret assembly and the quiet motivation of large projects revealed both his mood and his \"method.\" The occurrence of peculiar emblems, later directly associated with Freemasonry, on the title pages of early editions of the works of Bacon and his associates also suggest some hidden plan or purpose.

He discussed the characteristics of the faces which appeared on certain medallions and commemorative issues of coin- age. \"In my Lord Chancellor Bacon,\" he wrote, \"a spa- cious For-head, and piercing Eye, always (as I have been told by one who knew him well) looking upward; as a Soul in sublime Contemplation, and, as the Person, who by standing up against Dogmatists, was to emancipate, and set free the long and miserably captivated Philosophia, which has ever since made such Conquests in the Terri- tories of Nature.\" A few copies of the first edition of Sprat's The History of the Royal Societv of London included a plate or engrav- ing by Wenceslaus Hollar, from a design by Evelyn. Per- haps it was intended for a large paper edition which did not materialize. The elusive plate, reproduced herewith, depicts three persons closely involved in the formation of the Royal Society.

Evelyn developed his sketches according to principles of allegory rather than the rules of heraldry, and his mottoes were intended to convey the aims of the Society-the improvement of science by means of extended communica- tion verified by actual experiment only. Fortunately, the sheet of paper on which he made his first designs, together with several mottoes, has been preserved. The first emblem is peculiarly Baconian. Within the shield is a ship under full sail-the same vessel which occurs on the title pages of so many of Bacon's books. The motto, \"And science shall be advanced,\" is merely a re- statement of Bacon's outline for the advancement and pro- ficience of learning. The second shield is \"parted per/esse Argent and Sable, issuant from clouds in chief a hand holding a plumb line.\" The motto is from the Vulgate translation of I.

The accompanying motto, \"On the report of none,\" was later adopted by the Society. The last shield is charged with a terrestrial globe with a human eye in chief.

Evelyn wrote in his diary that on August 20, 1662, \"The King gave us the Arms of England to be borne in a canton in our Arms; and sent us a mace of silver-gilt of the same fashion and bigness as those carried before His Maty., to be borne before our President on meeting daies. It was brought by Sir Gilbert Talbot, Master of his Maty' Jewel-house.\" Later, on the 13th of June 1663, the officers of the Royal Society by common desire caused the royal grant of arms, together with the trick (a sketch thereof), to be entered among the records in the volume of royal concessions in the College of Arms, which was done upon the motion of Elias Ashmole, Esquire, Windsor Herald, and one of the Fellows of the said Society. Dr. Sprat,* the first historian of the Society, paid tribute to the genius that inspired the group:\". . . I shall only mention one great Man, who had the true Imagination of the whole Extent of this Enterprise, as it is now set on foot; and that is, the Lord Bacon; in whose Books there are every where scattered the best Arguments, that can be produc'd for the Defense of experimental Philosophy, and the best Directions, that are needful to promote it: All which he has already adorn'd with so much Art; that if my Desires could have prevail'd with some excellent Friends of mine, who engag'd me to this Work, there should have been no other Preface to the History of the Royal Society, but some of his Writings.\" Alfred Dodd believes that Rosicrucians and Freemasons were the driving forces behind that sequence of groups- the Invisible College, Gresham College, and the Academie -which finally emerged as the Royal Society. \"When we consider,\" he writes, \"that the real title of the New Atlantis was the Land of the Rosicrucians, with its ethical symbolism and its experimental marvels for the uplift of '~ce The History of th~ Royal Society of London."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 51 humanity by applied science, and that a Masonic authority like James Hughan declared that 'the New Atlantis seems to be, and probably is, the KEY to the modem Rituals of Freemasonry' ... we can begin to see clearly the light shining in the darkness of Francis Bacon's early 'Silent Years.' ,,* When the Viscountcy of St. Alban was bestowed upon him, Lord Bacon wrote: \"I may now be buried in St. Alban's habit as he lived.\" The slightest of his lordship's sayings must be carefully weighed, for he seldom spoke except the matter be relevant. It is quite possible that he intended to imply that he was resolved to bury, that is, conceal, some part of his own identity beneath the cloak of an ancient and honored name. It was a curious coinci- dence (almost too curious) that Bacon became Francis, Viscount St. Albans, and that the early Christian martyr, St. Alban, from whom the Viscounty received its name, was long and intimately connected with the early history of the Masonic Fraternity in England. Representations of the martyrdom of St. Alban were included in emblems known to have originated in the original Baconian group. The Royal Society was incorporated on St. Andrew's Day so \"each fellow wore a St. Andrew's cross of ribbon on the crown of his hat.\"t In the Chymische Hochzeit, Christian Rosencreutz was made to say that when pre- paring himself for the chemical marriage he bound a blood-red ribbon crossways over his shoulder and stuck four red roses in his hat. The crest of Johann Valentin Andreae was a St. Andrew's cross and four red roses, and the same cross is conspicuous on the arms of the town of St. Albans. 'See FranCIS Bacon's Personal Life Story. tSee [ohn Et/elyn, by Arthur Ponsonby (London,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"52 THE ADEPTS St. Alban was born at Verulam of a noble family. He journeyed to Rome where he served for seven years as a legionnaire under the Emperor Dioc1etian. Returning to Britain, he was converted to the Christian faith by the monk Amphibalus of Caerleon (Camelot); and, in the tenth, and last, persecution of the Christians, he was be- headed 303 A. D. Albanus was the first to suffer martyr- dom for the Christian faith in Britain. The account of his death appears in the writings of the Venerable Bede. The Roman Governor, learning that Albanus was protect- ing a Christian monk in his house, sent a troop of soldiers to arrest Amphibalus. In this emergency, Albanus put on the cloak of his guest and gave himself to the soldiers, thus permitting the holy man to escape. For this offense and for his unwillingness to renounce his faith, Albanus was executed. His death was accompanied by miraculous occurrences, and his memory was widely venerated. The sacrifice he made was in vain, for Amphibalus was captured and killed a few days later. The references to St. Alban in the old Masonic records of England include remarkable embellishments of un- certain origin and antiquity. William Preston summarizes the final form of the Masonic versions: \"St. Alban was employed by Carausius, to environ the city of Verulam with a wall, and to build for him a splendid palace; and that to reward his diligence in executing these works, the Emperor appointed him steward of his household and chief ruler of the realm. However this may be, from the corroborating testimony of ancient historians, we are assured that this knight was a celebrated architect, and a real encourager of able workmen; it cannot, therefore, be supposed that Freemasonry would be neglected by so eminent a patron.\"* 'S~c Illustrations of Masonry."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 53 According to the same author, the Emperor Carausius, who, incidentally, was merely a usurper of Britain, highly favored Masons, and appointed Albanus, his well-trusted steward, the principal superintendent of their assembly. \"Under his patronage,\" continues Preston, \"lodges and conventions of the Fraternity were formed, and the rites of Masonry regularly practiced. To enable the Masons to hold a general council to establish their own govern- ment, and correct errors among them, he granted them a charter, and Albanus to preside over them in person as Grand Master. This worthy knight proved a zealous friend to the Craft, and assisted at the initiation of many persons into the mystery of the order.\" Although the martyrdom of St. Alban is sustained by a quantity of traditional history, the Masonic ornamentations are scarcely justified by the conservative account. Albanus was a Roman soldier, possibly an officer, but when he is called a knight, this title seems forced or unwarranted. There is no evidence that the martyr was a celebrated architect or that he was made Grand Master of the stone- masons, even assuming that such guilds existed in England at that time. His building a palace for Carausius, the usurper, and his other achievements as a master artisan are without factual foundation. Had Albanus been a chief ruler of the realm and a favorite of his king, his trial and execution would probably have been averted. Incidentally, the garment which Albanus wore on the accasion of his arrest was called a caracalla, a cloak of wool said to resemble the vestment of old Jewish priests. The original cowl was preserved in the church of Ely in a chest, which was opened during the reign of Edward II, 1300 A. D. With the garment was found a writing which stated: \"This is the Caracalla of St. Amphibalus, the monk and preceptor of St. Alban; in which the proto-"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"54 THE ADEPTS martyr of England suffered death, under the cruel persecu- tion of Diocletian against the Christians.\" It was Mrs. Potts, in Francis Bacon and His Secret Society, who first pointed out the irregularities and incon- sistencies in the Masonic legend of St. Alban. England under Carausius did not recognize the sovereignty of Dio- cletian. If for Amphibalus we substitute the secret priest- hood of the Grail Mysteries and the Albigensian heresy, we shall be nearer to the facts. Carausius is a splendid cover for James I, regarded by many of his subjects as without just claim to the crown. Change St. Alban to Viscount St. Albans and shift the time to the first quarter of the 17th century, and the results are most informative. If Lord Bacon wished to hide his Secret Society or his own place in that Society, what course could be simpler than to cover himself with a caracalla of the ancient and venerated martyr? Bacon was a knight before he was elevated to the peerage. He was of noble family, and he presided over a Secret Society. He was the real encourager of able workmen, the chief ruler of the realm by the favor of his king, and a patron of all kinds of learn- ing. After his lordship was created Viscount St. Albans, there appears to have been further manipulation of the legend. The protomartyr was never \"next unto the King in authority,\" but Bacon as High Chancellor occupied this exact position and was virtual ruler of the State. It was also Lord Verulam, and not the Roman soldier, who built a magnificent palace for his king-a temple of learning, which, as James did not hesitate to acknowledge, was the greatest ornament of his nation.

Like the manuscript, La Tres Sainte 'Trinosopie, traditionally attributed to St.- Germain, and other fragments associated with the Comte's secret meetings on the estate of the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel, many of these strange rituals were patterned upon the Greek and Egyptian Mysteries. Some were directly inspired by the heresy of Manes. * Even while strange rites were developing within Free- masonry itself, independent enterprises came into existence outside the Order, and several of these sought refuge under the broad wing of Masonry when trouble threatened. The clandestine Lodges went so far in some cases as to attempt the complete domination of Continental Masonry. In the confusion that resulted, many useful landmarks were oblit- erated and much valuable information was lost. The common denominator of the pseudoesoteric Societies was elaborate ritualism. The frenzied dilettanti were initiated by fantastic rites into bizarre Orders that promised much, collected high fees, and bestowed nothing. It was a day of dupes and disappointments, of large promises and small fulfillments. In addition to its Masonic interests, Europe was still dominated by the Hermetic speculations which had in- trigued the minds of the 17th-century intelligentsia. To a degree, Freemasonry was regarded as a conglomerate of older Societies and the heir to their secret operations and public projects. The condition in Germany was typical.

The Baron, a sincere and lovable intellectual, was lured on by frequent promises that the higher grades would reveal all. He ascended to the top of the ritualistic ladder only to find that it ended in empty space. The Society with which the good baron was affiliated had branches in many Euro- pean cities and claimed a wide sphere of influence. He took his disillusionment seriously, and under the pseudo- nym, Magister Pianco, wrote a scathing expose in High German, titled Der Rosenkreuzer in seiner Blosse (The Rosicrucian in his Nakedness). Magister Pianco com- plained that he and thousands of others seeking wisdom had been subjected to the vilest possible impostures. The baron was profoundly confused. There was so much of beauty in the old symbols, so much of legendry and lore derived from ancient authorities, and so many solemn and majestic rituals that it seemed impossible that all could be false. Somewhere the true wisdom of antiquity must have been preserved. There was nothing to do but to seek further, so the baron continued his quest, the result of which unhappily has not been recorded. Most of the spurious groups followed a general pattern. A few distinguished patrons, selected from the aristocracy and the sciences, were induced to lend the prestige of their names and stations. A genteel membership was then quietly solicited, limited by an exorbitant fee of initiation to those in prosperous circumstances.

The prestige and wealth accumulated by Secret Societies have sometimes been used as -political weapons. This often happened even without the knowledge or consent of the membership. Groups, supposedly seeking only universal wisdom, conspired against the State, unseated rulers, and went so far as to sponsor anarchy. A network of private agencies thus came into existence, which could be used according to the tempers of leaders whose true motives were unknown or uncertain. Literally hundreds of these independent movements, all claiming an ancient and honorable history, converged upon the Masonic Grand Lodges at a time when Masonry was struggling to clarify its own position. Secret organizations of one kind or another were both expedient and fashionable. Almost any subject suitable for group discussion, from chemistry to' cosmic conscious- ness and from legal reform to literary criticism, required a mystical Order or an esoteric reading circle for its very existence. Well-intentioned intellectuals could not gather to discuss Boethius, Boehme, or Bacon without the para- phernalia of red-plush curtains, high altars, secret grips, and mystic passwords. Humorous works appeared ridicul- ing this fashion. One of the these explained how the mem- bers of a dining circle had to pass through an elaborate series of contortions, including darkened chambers and fiery ordeals, in order to assemble for a quiet dinner of potted chicken.

This conference examined the records of several Grand Lodges which claimed to"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"possess the secrets of the higher degrees of Freemasonry. The secrets were not discovered, but the controversial issue as to whether Masonry was to be considered a continuation of the Order of the Knights Templars was decided by a negative vote after thirty sittings. In the last quarter of the 18th century, the public mind, more and more disillusioned in its quest for mystic lore, turned its attention to the pressing problems of social reform and representative government. Esoteric Orders with interest beyond the imminent continued to exist, but were reserved for the edification of small groups of thoughtful scholars, and these made little effort to attract public attention. Freemasonry, integrating its internal structure, gathered the remnants and records of the earlier exubera- tions, pronounced the irregular rites to be extinct, and retired the magnificent vellum \"Charges\" as literary curiosities. Space permits only a brief survey of this remarkable restoration of pagan esoteric doctrines. The situation was partly due to increasing skepticism among intellectuals, which resulted from the broadening sphere of scientific influence and partly from the deepening conviction that the clergy was in conspiracy with the aristocracy to per- petuate the serfdom of the masses. One expression of the general discontent was an effort to restore the Mystery system as a means for accomplishing educational reform. The lack of esoteric content in the orthodox degrees of 18th-century Freemasonry also supplied incentive to enrich the mystical overtones of the accepted symbols and cere- momes. The Rite of Perfection, or Rite of Heredom, was estab- lished by the Chevalier de Bonneville in the College of Jesuits of Clermont in Paris, in 1754. The College of Clermont was the asylum of those adhering to the party MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60 THE ADEPTS of Stuart, and therefore the rite is said to have been strong- ly colored by the political prejudices and peculiarities of the Stuart cause. The Rite of Perfection consisted of twenty-five degrees, which may be recognized as the same as those of the Council of Emperors of the East and West. These degrees, so far as they go, reappear in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. General Pike tells us that this Rite succeeded the Council of Emperors and inherited the principal distinguishing concept which dominated the Rite of Perfection. This concept, which also passed into the Rite of Strict Observance, held that Freemasonry was derived from Templarism and that consequently every Freemason was a Knight Templar. Standard Masonic histories enlarge upon this theme to the average reader's satisfaction. Martines de Pasqually was a man of considerable learn- ing who had traveled widely in the Near East, having visited Turkey, Arabia, and Palestine. He founded the Rite of Elected Cohens in 1754. After his death, a num- berof his papers and manuscripts descended rather cir- cuitously and were examined by Dr. Gerard Encausse (Papus) in 1895. Pasqually believed in the inspiration of the Scriptures, the downfall of the angels, the theory of original sin, and the doctrine of justification by faith. He held that man existed in an elemental state long before the creation detailed in Genesis, and was gradually evolved into his present form. Louis Claude de Saint-Martin (1743-1803), French mystic and ritualist, was known as \"le philosophe inconnu,\" and his works were published under this pseudonym. Saint- Martin came of a family of wealth and gentle breeding. His mother died when he was a small child, but he had a most generous and indulgent stepmother. He was edu- cated in law at the College de Pontlevoy. Though physical-"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 61 ly frail and given to mental pursuits, he decided to change his career and selected the profession of soldiering. Before entering the army, he became a Freemason, and even as a young man was devoted to the study of religious phi- losophy. While his regiment was stationed at Bordeaux, he con- tacted the new system of Masonic rites which had been introduced by Martines de Pasqually. Saint-Martin was initiated into the Elected Priesthood in 1768, and amplified his learning by an intensive reading of Swedenborg. In 1771, he resigned from the army to become a teacher and leader in the field of mysticism. He traveled considerably, and his ideas were received with enthusiasm. \"It is to Martines de Pasqually,\" says Saint-Martin, \"that I owe my introduction to the higher truth.\" The Elected Priest- hood then consisted of seven grades, of which the seventh was a grade of Rose Croix. No details of the working of this grade appear to have survived. Ceremonial magic may have been included in the work of Pasqually, and there are references to the teachings of Boehme and the spiritualistic productions of Dr. John Dee. Apparently, psychic phenomena were included in the early Martinist movement. Although Saint-Martin had been raised a strict Catholic and always remained sympathetic to the Church, his first work, Of Errors and Truth, was placed on the Index. Saint-Martin's ideal society was \"a natural and spiritual theocracy,\" in which God would raise up men of mark, who would regard themselves strictly as \"divine com- missioners\" to guide the people. The writings of Saint-Martin were brought to the con- sideration of Voltaire. In 1787, Saint-Martin went to Italy with Prince Galitzin, then journeyed to Strasbourg, where he further studied the writings of Boehme, trans-"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62 THE ADEPTS lating parts of them into French. Back in Paris, he was arrested during the Revolution simply because he was a gentleman by birth. His affiliations with the Freemasons saved him from the Reign of Terror. He visited London, where he remained for several months, made the acquaint- ance of the astronomer, Herschel, and contacted the writ- ings of William Law, the great interpreter of Boehme. Saint-Martin never married, but had a wide circle of friends and admirers, including many of the leaders of the intellectual world. The central concept of Saint-Martin's mystical philosophy is that man remains divine in spite of the \"fall\" reported in the Scriptures. Within the human being lies dormant a high spiritual quality of which man is not always conscious, and which he must develop or release by freeing himself from the illusion of materialism. Saint-Martin died suddenly, presumably of a stroke while at prayer. There is considerable doubt as to the 'place of Baron Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) in the direct stream of Masonic descent. Samuel Beswick* affirmed that the baron, when about eighteen years of age, was initiated for the first time into the mysteries of Freemasonry at Lund, the capital of Scomen, the most southern province of Sweden. Later, he joined or affiliated with the Stock- holm Chapter. Beswick noted that it was not uncommon to accept minors into the Lodges at that time, giving the example that George Washington was initiated before attaining his majority. It has been pointed out in the same work that the French scientist, De Lalande, invited Swedenborg to visit the Lodge of the Nine Sisters in Paris, and that the baron was present at least once while De Lalande was Worshipful Master. ·See Swedenborg Rite and the Great Masonic Leaders of the 18th Century (New York, 1870)."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 63 Most Masonic historians doubt that Swedenborg was ever regularly initiated, but there is evidence in his writings that he was aware of the principal symbols used in Masonry, and Freemasons of the higher degrees certainly gathered inspiration and comfort from his mystical philosophy.

He said that these brethren were original- ly all Swedenborgians and were at first distinct from the followers or adepts of Weishaupt. Later, they fraternized intimately. The Swedenborgian Rite seems to have opened its first Lodge in Stockholm between 1750 and 1755. For reasons of safety or secrecy, no exact records were kept. Another Lodge was later opened in Berlin under the auspices of the King of Prussia. At the suggestion of Prince Charles, Swedenborg sent two copies of his Apocalypsis Revelata to Cardinal Prince de Rohan in 1766, and three years later, when the baron was in Paris, Prince de Rohan visited him. The cardinal was a Mason, for he was one of the signers of the patent given to Stephen Morin, appointing him Inspector-General of the Lodges, etc., in all parts of the New World. It is significant that Voltaire should devote time and research to defending the Manichaeans from the early attacks of St. Augustine. Fortunatus publicly challenged St. Augustine, as one who had assisted in the rituals of the sect, to declare openly and before the whole population as to whether any part of the Manichaean worship was impure or obscene. St. Augustine evaded the issue and tried to shift the argument from morals to death. At last, however, pressed by Fortunatus, he said grudgingly: \"I acknowledge that in the prayer at which I assisted, I did not see you commit anything impure.\" The learned M. de Beausobre shrewdly observed that it would be impossible to reconcile the saint's misgivings with the simple fact that Augustine himself remained for years a devotee of the Manichaean sect without, apparently, coming upon any- thing in their practices which offended his morals."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 65 Voltaire enlarged this discussion with many choice quota- tions and observations, and by his attitude aligned himself with the revival of the philosophy of Manes, which was behind and beneath most of the political and ethical Secret Societies of 18th-century Europe. Voltaire was initiated into Freemasonry the year of his death. He became a member of the Lodge of the Nine Sisters (Muses) at Paris, the 7th day of February 1778. This Lodge was remark- able both for the quality of its initiates and for its direct influence upon developments of the Great Work in the Western Hemisphere. Voltaire died May 30, 1778, and a Lodge of Sorrow was held in his memory on the 28th of November of the same year. His heart was removed from the body at the time of embalming and preserved in a silver case. Nearly seventy years after his death, the sarcophagus in the Pantheon was opened so that the heart could be placed with the rest of the remains, but the tomb was found to be empty. The initiation of Voltaire into the Masonic Order only a few months before his decease is in startling contrast to the legend of his final reconciliation with the Church. Legends circulated at the time that he died repenting his impiety appear to have been inventions of his enemies. His last words were a request, rather petulantly stated, that he be left alone to die in peace. Voltaire was well- acquainted with the esoteric teachings of the Mysteries and was deeply involved in the processes of social reforma-\" tion then operating in France. In 1839, a French Mason, Brother E. J. Marconis de Negre, instituted the Rite of Memphis, which Ragon be- lieved to have been inspired by the extinct Rite of Mizraim. The new Rite, which worked ninety or more degrees, was not acknowledged among the systems acceptable to the Grand Orient of France until 1862. To accomplish"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66 THE ADEPTS this favorable relationship with the French Grand Orient, Marconis, who was then the Grand Hierophant, was obliged to divest himself of all authority over the Rite and to accept complete \"obedience\" to the Grand Orient of France. This august body retired all the higher degrees as Masonic curiosities, and the initiates of the Rite were not permitted to claim any higher degree than that of Master Mason. According to Marconis, the Rite of Memphis was brought to Europe by Ormus, an Egyptian priest and sage of Alexandria who was converted by St. Mark in 46 A. D., and who purified the Egyptian doctrine according to Chris- tian principles. Manes was also involved, and the stand taken by Marconis was the same as that presented in the Orders of the Quest. The adept tradition was preserved by the followers of Ormus until the year 1150 A. D., when eighty-one of! these initiates went to Sweden, presented themselves to the Archbishop of Usal, explained their Masonic doctrines to him, and established Masonry in Europe. The leader of these knights was Garimont, ap- parently a corruption of Garimond, the mysterious patri- arch of Jerusalem, before whom the. Hospitalers are said to have taken their vows of obedience, chastity, and poverty. The legend of the eighty-one M asons, or brethren, visiting Sweden has been dismissed as \"absurd,\" but appears less unreasonable when the existence of an esoteric tradition behind Freemasonry is recognized. Certainly, the Sanctuary of Memphis was dedicated to the same sublime work that has activated the Mysteries and Secret Societies of all enlightened nations. Of this, Marconis wrote in his \"Dis- course of Esoteric Masonry:\" \"The statute of Isis, always veiled even to the priests, and the sphinx crouching at the door of the temple in an attitude of repose and silence, were the two emblem'S of these lost secrets; and this con- duct of the trustees of the mysteries was dictated by the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 67 highest wisdom. The despotic rule of strong violent men extended over the whole earth. Everywhere the inexorable 'vae victis' was the only international and political law; everywhere heads had to bow or were crushed. It is easily understood from this that the trustees of the primitive knowledge of human grandeur, of its sublime dignity, of its equality before the Creator, of its inalterable liberty, were forced to hide their treasure, and to communicate it only to those who were found to be worthy, for before communicating it, they had to be certain that the new candidate did not intend to sell the knowledge to their enemies.\" Among the apocrypha of the Rite is one relating to the initiation of Plato into the Mysteries of Memphis.

He sought initiation, and underwent trials in dark caverns under the earth. Three men with helmet's representing the heads of dogs guarded a door of iron. They warned him of the dangers ahead, but the neophyte pressed on, passing through frightful experiences, until he finally came to a room lighted by hundreds of torches, where sat sixty priests robed in fine linen and wearing the insignia of their ranks. Initiation was followed by a retreat of eighty-one days, and later there were six months of study devoted to the sacred sciences. The initiate then took an oath of silence and was acknowledged as one of the Sacred College. From this and similar statements it is evident that Marconis, like many other Masonic innovators of the period, was convinced that Masonry was in some way the continua- tion of ancient mystical Societies dedicated to the enlarge- ment of the human estate.

To press the matter further is to be confronted with other Masonic difficulties. Brother Cagliostro (Esperance Lodge, No. 289, London) is de- scribed by some as heir, through the Jesuits, to informa- tion which they had filched from the Rosicrucians. It is all exceedingly complicated, but the essential principles remain unchanged and the formula is repeated so frequent- ly that one may suggest that the presence of so much smoke indicates some fire. The Rite of Strict Observance In 1754, Carl GottheIf von Hund, claiming authority from Superiores Incogniti (Unknown Superiors), estab- lished the Rite of Strict Observance. Von Hund was initiated into the mysteries of Freemasonry in the Lodge of the Three Thistles at Frankfort-on-the-Main, probably in 1742. Albert Mackey declared that two things relating to von Hund had been well-settled. First, he was initiated as a Knight Templar in 1743; second, at the same time he received the appointment of a Provincial Grand Master with ample powers to propagate the Order in Germany. It has been suggested that the Unknown Superiors, who authorized the Rite of Strict Observance, were Knights Templars, although there has been considerable contro- versy among orthodox Masonic historians as to the survival of any organizing body of Templars at so late a date. It is unwise to follow the thinking of certain other students of the higher degrees who consider the Rite of Strict Ob- servance to be merely a Jesuit mechanism attempting to undermine Freemasonry by holding out promises of a"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 69 restoration of the temporal powers and worldly treasures of the Order of the Temple. After all, von Hund was a staunch Protestant and at one time financed the erection of a Protestant church. Equally unsatisfactory is the effort to identify the Rite of Strict Observance with the ill-fated family of the Stuarts. The Jacobite cause held passing interest for some members of the Rite; but even on his deathbed, Baron von Hund reiterated the truth of his original claim that he was the agent of the Unknown Superiors, and there seems no reason to doubt his integrity. The existence of a Secret Order of Templars at the time under consideration was defended by Cadet Gassicourt in his book, Le Tombeau de jacques Molai, Paris, 1796. He said that the celebrated adept, M. de St.-Germain, was traveling in Leipzig and Dresden under the name of Comte Weldon, establishing communication between the Lodges of Masonry and the Templars, of which he was an emissary. In his letter to Count Gortz, St.-Germain says: \"At the present moment I have promised to visit Hanau, to meet the Landgrave Karl at his brother's and work out with him the system of the 'strict Observance'-the regenera- tion of the order of freemasons in an aristocratic sense- which interests you too so much.\" Albert Pike, in his Morals and Dogma) states emphatical- ly: \"Cagliostro was the Agent of the Templars, and there- fore wrote to the Free-Masons of London that the time had come to begin the work of rebuilding the Temple of th Eternal.

In Franc-M aconnerie, the Baron du Potet stated that this castle, which was thirty miles from Paris, belonged to the Marquis de Garadin, the friend and protector of Jean Jacques Rousseau. A description of the initiation of the Count and Countess di Cagliostro into St.-Germain's Lodge of Illuminists ap- peared in Memoires Authentique pour Servir a l'Historie du Comte de Cagliostro. This work was published anony- mously in 1785, but is generally attributed to the Marquis du Luchet. Mr. Waite, as always, dismissed the entire account as a \"comedy.\" We differ from this learned gentle- man on the grounds that the circumstances are far from humorous. Du Luchet, who certainly was not present, may have received an unreliable description of what actually occurred, and, in turn, due to personal prejudices, con- tributed his own variations upon the theme. According to this account, Cagliostro had requested the favor of a secret audience in order that he might pay homage to the \"God of the Faithful.\" St.-Germain set the time at 2 A. M. The drawbridge was lowered for the Cagliostros' reception, and they were led into a dimly lighted room. Suddenly, two massive doors opened and a sanctuary resplendent with thousands of lighted candles dazzled their vision. On an altar in the midst of the room sat the mysterious St.-Germain. At his feet knelt two acolytes holding golden bowls of perfume. The \"God of the Faithful\" wore upon his chest a pectoral of diamonds"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"MASONIC 6RDERS OF FRATERNITY 71 of such brilliance that the eye could scarcely bear their radiance. A voice inquired from the visitors who they were, where they came from, and what they wanted. Cagliostro and his wife knelt before the altar, and after a long pause Cagliostro gave this short address in a low voice: \"I come to invoke the God of the Faithful, the Son of Nature, the Father of Truth. I come to ask one of the fourteen thou- sand and seven secrets that he bears in his bosom. I come to give myself up as his slave, his apostle, his martyr.\" Later in the same ritual, a mysterious book was opened and Cagliostro listened while his own future was read to him, with a detailed description of his persecution, trial, dishonor, and imprisonment. On this occasion St.-Germain assumed a most exalted role. He was personally venerated by his followers and actually worshiped as a god. This Illuminist ritual revealed St.-Germain in his full splendor as a Sovereign Prince of the Philosophic Empire. The entire account, including du Luchet's grotesque and com- pletely false conclusions, was intended to imply a restora- tion of the secret rites of the Knights Templars. Cagliostro acknowledged himself as a disciple of the far more astute and skillful Hermetic adept. There is no doubt that Cagliostro's voluntary sacrifice of himself and his reputa- tion at the psychological moment directed the attention of the Inquisition from the principal activities of the Un- known Superiors, referred to by von Hund. Even St.-Ger- main's reputation has suffered considerably from the pens of uninitiated historians. Of the Comte, H. P. Blavatsky writes: \"The treatment this great man, this pupil of Indian and Egyptian hierophants, this proficient in the secret wis- dom of the East, has had from Western writers, is a stigma upon human nature.\"* In the same article, she mentioned ·See A Modern Panarion,"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 THE ADEPTS Alessandro di Cagliostro as one whose name has been made the synonym of infamy by a forged biography. It is incredible in the light of the events of history that the Rite of Strict Observance could have been under the wing of the most celebrated of all the European adepts, the Comte de St.-Germain, and at the same time have been a contrivance of the Jesuits. It seems wiser to assume that the Unknown Superiors, to whom von Hund gave such faithful allegiance, belonged to the same body of initiates responsible for the appearance of such men as St.-Germain and Cagliostro. After the death of Baron von Hund, his Masonic activities came under the general leadership of the Grand Duke of Brunswick, one of St.-Germain's more intimate friends. Among the Comte's associates in Vienna was the eccentric Count J. F. von Kufstein, reported to have been a Rosicru- cian, who had a Lodge in the house of Prince Auersperg where mysterious meetings were held late at night. St.- Germain was present at one or more of these secret sessions. While in Vienna, he also assisted Dr. Franz Anton Mesmer in his researches in animal magnetism. At this time, the remarkable Comte was known as the \"American of the Felderhof.\" That St.-Germain was a Freemason cannot be doubted, and, for a time at least, he conducted his own Lodge in Paris. The catalogue of the Masonic library of the Grand Orient of France lists, under item N. 498, the register of the Loge du Contrat Social de St. Jean d'Ecosse. This register, covering the period from 1775 to 1789, includes the signatures of both St.-Germain and Rousseau. Mrs. Cooper-Oakley,\" quoting the late librarian of the Great Ambrosiana Library at Milan, says: \"And when, in order 'See Tile Comte de St.-Germain, by Isabel Cooper-Oakley."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 73 to bring about a conciliation between the various sects of the Rosicrucians, the N ecromantists, the Cabalists, the Illuminati, the Humanitarians, there was held a great Con- gress at Wilhelmsbad, then in the Lodge of the 'Amici riuniti' there was also Cagliostro, with St. Martin, Mesmer and Saint-Germain.\" It is not likely that St.-Germain would have been a representative of French Masonic groups without himself being a member of the Order. Among those who came within the auras of St.-Germain and Cagliostro was the Chevalier Casanova de Seingalt, who was made a Mason at Lyons in 1758. Even this adventurer held Masonry in considerable esteem, though he was convinced that most initiates of the Order did not understand its true mysteries. In spite of the defects of his own character, Casanova respected the learning and integrity without which the Great Work of the Craft could not be accomplished. The acquaintance between St.-Germain and the Marquis de Lafayette was strengthened by their participation in the activities of the Lodge of the Nine Sisters. Benjamin Franklin was elected honorary Grand Master of this Lodge and later directed the initiation of Voltaire. General Pike points out that at this critical period in Masonic history at least eight hundred degrees of one kind or another were invented. \"The rituals even of the re- spectable Degrees,\" he writes, \"copied and mutilated by ignorant men, became nonsensical and trivial i and the words so corrupted that it has hitherto been found im- possible to recover many of them at all ....

These Rites resembled those old palaces and baronial castles, the different parts of which, built at different periods remote from one another, upon plans and according to tastes that greatly varied, formed a discordant and in- congruous whole.\" Not enough consideration has been given to this apparent- ly spontaneous and profuse growth of degrees. Most of the men responsible for these strange rites were suspected or even convicted of esoteric inclinations and associations. A mutual friendship and admiration existed among them, and their names occur together in a variety of curious patterns. Most of them were dedicated to the restoration of the esoteric tradition and its perpetuation under the symbolism of the pagan Mysteries of antiquity. These initiates were closely linked with some sovereign well be referred to as the Unknown Superiors. Elements of nco-Egyptian religion and philosophy in terms of prevailing body of descent which, for want of clearer definition, could opinions upon these recondite subjects were everywhere present. Under the pressure of these mystical imponder- ables, the house of Freemasonry appeared for a time to be divided against itself. One part, which was rapidly to disappear from public admiration, was dedicated to the perpetuation of the secret doctrine and to the fulfillment of the Great Work of the initiated builders. The other part, which was to emerge and to assume domination over the Craft, was resolved to sever all connections with the esoteric systems of initiation and to advance Masonry as an essentially fraternal organization. In what has been referred to as \"the sober light of the 19th century,\" trans- cendentalism fell into disrepute, and Freemasonry, at least for a time and at least by appearances, disclaimed its ancient heritage."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 75 The Rite of Strict Observance was for all practical purposes destroyed by the very forces which had been falsely credited with its formation. The disintegrating agent operated through Johann August von Starck, who attempted to impose the domination of the clergy upon the Rite. This clerical group finally succeeded, and the Lodges of Strict Observance afterwards called themselves the United German Lodges. T he Illuminati The name Illuminati has been assumed by, or bestowed upon, various groups of mystics and metaphysical intellec- tualists claiming to possess an internal enlightenment about divine or human matters. A number of sects may be in- cluded under this general title, as the Alumbrados of Spain and the Guerinets of France. In the present usage, how- ever, the name Illuminati is most often applied to the Order founded in Bavaria, in 1776, by Adam Weishaupt. This movement was regarded with favor by a number of brilliant and outstanding men, including Goethe, Herder, Nicolai, Ernest II of Gotha, and Karl August of Weimar. Adam Weishaupt was born at Ingolstadt on February 6, 1748, and departed from this life at Gotha in 1830. His father died when the boy was only seven years old, and his godfather, Baron Ickstatt, entrusted the early training of the lad to the Jesuits. The baron had an excellent personal library, well-stocked with works by French philoso- phers belonging to the school of \"reason.\" Weishaupt believed that he found in these writings answers to the doubts and misgivings which he entertained over certain dogmas of his Jesuit tutors.

Two years later, the promising young professor was made dean of the faculty of law, assuming this heavy responsibility in the educational sphere when but twenty-seven years old.

There can be no doubt that Dean Weishaupt found him- self in the midst of scholastic plotting and counterplotting.

Educational politics still flourish at the expense of essential learning, and the con- dition was much worse at that critical period when ecclesi- asticism was fighting to retain its influence in higher educa- The idea of a secret assembly or association to protect the liberals from the conservatives was incubated in the heavy atmosphere of Ingolstadt. The links with the past are obvious. Dr. Vernon Stauffer says of Weishaupt: \"His imagination having taken heat from his reflections upon the attractive power of the Eleusinian mysteries and the influence exerted by the secret cult of the Pythagoreans, it was first in Weishaupt's thought to seek in the Masonic institutions of the day the opportunity he coveted for the propagation of his views.\"* Weishaupt founded the Order of the Illuminati on May 1, 1776. The original membership consisted of five persons of resolute purpose but of uncertain method. The following year Weishaupt became a member of the Society of Freemasons and was initiated into the Lodge Theodore of Good Counsel, at Munich. The Lodge was virtually absorbed into the Illuminist Order almost immediately. Early in his career, the Dean of Ingolstadt was fortunate enough to gain the assistance of two important and in- fluential gentlemen. The first was Baron Adolf von Knigge, privy councilor of Saxe- Weimar; the second was Johann Joachim Christoph Bode, a man of upright character) high social position, and cultivated mind. Both von Knigge and Bode were Freemasons. Baron Knigge was deeply immersed in the activities of Secret Societies, and had joined the Lodge of Strict ·See New England tile Bavarian Illuminati (New York, 1918)."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78 THE ADEPTS Observance which was dabbling with esoteric and mystical arts. The baron, especially addicted to alchemical specula- tions, tried to affiliate himself with the existing Rosicrucian groups, but was unable to make a satisfactory alliance- at least, such is the report. Like Knigge, a constant seeker after rare knowledge, Bode came to the Illuminati from the Rite of Strict Observance. He was a musician who turned bookseller, and, as a sideline, translated into German the popular works of Fielding, Smollett, and Goldsmith. Bode had a wide knowledge of Masonic history and the origins of the rites, but he does not appear to have organ- ized his opinions on these subjects. These three men, Weishaupt, von Knigge, and Bode, fashioned a Secret Society, patterned upon the rites and rituals of ancient Mysteries and dedicated to the perpetua- tion of esoteric knowledge and the social improvement of their fellow men. The Illuminist Order never attracted a large membership. Historians hazard the guess that its strength did not exceed two thousand heads at any time, but they were distinguished heads. The role of member- ship is reminiscent of the Almanach de Gotha. A con- siderable percentage of the Brothers were men of con- sequence, including reigning princes, noblemen, prominent educators, scholars, scientists, and men of letters. Most of these intellectuals were addicted, at least in private, to the opinions expressed so eloquently by Rousseau and Voltaire. Certainly there was an undercurrent of things esoteric, in the most mystical sense of that word, beneath the surface of Illuminism. In this respect, the Order followed exactly in the footsteps of the Knights Templars. The Templars returned to Europe after the Crusades, bringing with them a number of choice fragments of Oriental occult lore, some of which they had gathered from the Druses of Lebanon,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"and some from the disciples of Hasan Ibn-al-Sabbah, the old wizard of Mount Alamut. If there was a deep mystical current flowing beneath the surface of Illuminism, it is certain that Weishaupt was not the Castalian Spring. Perhaps the lilies of the Illuminati and the roses of the Rosicrucians were, by a miracle of Nature, flowing upon the same stem. The old symbolism would suggest this, and it is not always wise to ignore ancient landmarks. There is only one explanation that meets the obvious and natural requirements of the known facts. The Illuminati were part of an esoteric tradition which had descended from remote antiquity and had re- vealed itself for a short time among the Humanists of Ingolstadt. One of the blossoms of the \"sky plant\" was there, but the roots were afar in better ground. Weishaupt emerged as a faithful servant of a higher cause. Behind him moved the intricate machinery of the Secret Schools. As usual, they did not trust their full weight to any perishable institution. The physical history of the Bavarian Illuminati extended over a period of only twelve years. It is difficult to understand, therefore, the profound stir which this movement caused in the political life of Europe. We are forced to the realization that this Bavarian group was only one fragment of a large and com- posite design. All efforts to discover the members of the higher grades of the Illuminist Order have been unsuccessful. It has been customary, therefore, to assume that these higher grades did not exist except in the minds of Weishaupt and von Knigge. Is it not equally possible that a powerful group of men, resolved to remain entirely unknown, moved behind Weishaupt and pushed him forward as a screen for its own activities?

The work that was unfinished in 1785 remains unfinished in 1950. Eso- teric Orders will not become extinct until the purpose which brought them into being has been fulfilled. Organ- izations may perish, but the Great School is indestructible. Of passing interest is the crusade of the Reverend Jedediah Morse of Charleston, South Carolina, against the threat of an Illuminist invasion of the United States. Capitalizing on the proclamation issued by President John Adams, March 23, 1798, referring to the hazardous and afflictive position in which the country had been placed, the Rev. Morse preached with great fervor against the atheistic French State and its determination to corrupt the morals of the Western Hemisphere. A minor tempest followed, both sides of the issue resolute but uninformed. The Illuminati were presented as a huge association of godless persons determined to destroy the Church and State. Rev. Morse depended largely upon certain memoires of J acobinism invented and compiled by Abbe Barruel, and the attacks on Freemasons, the Illuminati, and the Reading Societies by Dr. John Robison. This learned doctor should have limited his interests to his chosen fields of hydro- dynamics, astronomy, electricity, and magnetism. His readings in Freemasonry seem to have undermined his critical faculties, for he decided that an association had been formed for the express purpose of corrupting all the religious establishments and existing governments of Europe. This group was the Illuminati, which had apparently been disbanded, but actually had extended its activities through- out the whole world."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 81 In the ensuing flurry, a number of excited clergymen quoted each other and sometimes themselves to prove the horrible hazards of the hour. George Washington was cited, Mr. Noah Webster orated, and politicians warned their constituents that opposing candidates were probably Illuminists in disguise. Of course, Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson received appropriate criticism, and it was even suggested that the American Society of United Irishmen was subversive. Masonic Lodges were suspected of deep and dark doings, in spite of the fact that most of the patriots of the Revolutionary period, including General Warren, who fell at Bunker Hill, and George Washington, were Freemasons of standing and reputation. Actually, the Illuminist bubble was little better than a clerical hysteria, and there is no proof that there was any substance beneath the extravagant reports. If European Secret Societies of the period exercised an influence in the young American Republic, such influence certainly was not malevolent. The results, if any, are found in the separation of the State and Church, a clear-cut policy in American government. George Washington stated firmly that he did not believe that doctrines of the Illuminati or principles of Jacobianism had spread in the United States. At the same time, he defended the integrity of the Masonic Lodges of his country. Among those who had received initiation into the school of Martines de Pasqually was Jacques Cazotte (1720-1792), usually included among the 18th-century Rosicrucians. About 1775 he embraced the tenets and projects of the Illuminati.

The dinner, enlivened by stories, anecdotes, and witticisms, was dominated by a Voltairian attitude on matters political and theological. The diners finally con- cluded that an intellectual revolution would soon be com- plete and that in a few years superstition and fanaticism would give place to philosophy. The various members of the company then conversed pleasantly as to which of them would live to see the Reign of Reason. During this conversation, one man sat quietly listening, but took no part in the general enthusiasm.

At last he spoke: \"Gentlemen, be satisfied; you will all see this grand and sublime revolution.

Cazotte answered quietly: \"You will die also on the scaffold.\" At this moment, M. de la Harpe, who chronicled the incident, asked: \"And what will happen to me?\" Cazotte smiled. \"You will be yourself a miracle as extraordinary as any which I have told; you will then be a Christian.\" The Duchess of Grammond remarked that it appeared that chivalry was not at an end. These predictions had not been directed toward the ladies. Cazotte bowed. \"Your sex, ladies, will be no guarantee for you in these times. My Lady Duchess, you will be conducted to the scaffold, with several other ladies, in the cart of the executioner, and with your hands tied behind your backs. Greater ladies than you will have the same end. You will not even have a confessor.

Cazotte then bowed and departed. M. de la Harpe made a careful record of the predictions and their fulfillment. He bore witness to the fact that all the prophecies were fulfilled to the smallest detail. It was on his deathbed that he drew up the final statement of the outworking of the strange predictions. M. de la Harpe lived through the Revolution and did become a Christian. Cazotte's remarkable powers of foreknowledge suggest a more detailed examination of the so-called political Societies and their initiates. Everywhere in the operations of these groups were intimations and indications of an operative transcendentalism. Men like St.-Germain, Saint- Martin, Cagliostro, Mesmer, and Cazotte cannot be ex- plained by calling them shrewd opportunists, impostors. or adventurers. They certainly shared a secret kind of knowl- edge, and were operating from a plan or trestle board. While this dimension of their activities is denied or ignored we can have no clear picture of the workings of the adept schools in the great century of revolutions.

Although this curious book is the product of extensive research and profound erudition, it certainly did not originate in antiquity. It was a complete invention, possibly derived in part from a work on the rituals of initiation by Humberto Malhandrini, published in Venice in 1657. The 18th century was distinguished by several strange pseudo- Egyptian esoteric writings which appear to have originated in some common source. The Grata Repoa, or Initiations to the Ancient Mysteries of the Priests of Egypt) made its appearance for the first time in the German edition of 1770, and was published without either the name of the author or the printer. The librarian Stahlbaum published a second edition in Berlin in 1778, declaring that the author of the work was until that time unknown, and that an ineffectual search had been made for him in every corner of Germany. The dis- tinguished scholar Ragon supposed the Grata Repoa to be a concoction by learned Germans of all that could be found in ancient writers on initiation. At this period the Comte de St.-Germain was practicing Masonic or Rosicrucian rituals and Illuministic rites, laden with Egyptian symbolism, in secret rooms and hidden cellars of the palace of Prince Karl of Hesse Cassel at Eckernforde.

In his Mozart und die konigliche Kunst, Paul Nett! pointed out that Mozart's Illuminist opera, The Magic Flute, derived most of its Egyptian atmosphere from The Lite of Sethos, especially its section dealing with the initia- tion of Orpheus and Eurydice. The libretto of this work has been ascribed to Johann Emanuel Schikaneder, a Free- mason, but there has been some question as to how this clever but not profound man accomplished so extraordinary a production. A careful study of the libretto will convince even the skeptical-minded that many of the lines were taken almost verbatim from Sethos. The Third Book of The Life of Seth os devoted consider- able space to a discussion of the qualities and attributes of the true initiate. Those who had received initiations occupied a middle ground between the aristocracy and the priesthood, and exercised both temporal and spiritual powers. The initiate was described as a new man in whom the love of virtue and duty had taken the place of all those passions which formerly motivated action. Regardless of rank, due to either birth or fortune, the initiate believed himself destined for the benefit of his own country and for all mankind. These Masters transformed savage peoples"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 89 into civilized nations by the establishment of good laws, by instruction in the arts and sciences, and by making them- selves examples of heroic virtues. In short, the world owes to the initiates whatever worthy and cultured form it now exhibits. These adepts were men without blemish, yet con- stantly seeking improvement; men in most things perfect, yet ever striving for a greater perfection. Sethos belonged to a class of esoteric writings and, like the Comte de Gabalis, originated in the schools of adepts functioning secretly beneath the surface of European cul- ture. Such works are always difficult to trace, for their authors had no intention of being discovered. If need arose, they were attributed, with or without permission, to some scholar who found it advisable to be noncommittal. The career of Ignace von Born, a celebrated metallurgist and intellectual, is of interest at this stage of the inquiry. This distinguished mining engineer was an ardent Free- mason and the founder of a Masonic Lodge in Vienna. Mozart was a member of this Lodge, as was also the com- poser, Joseph Haydn. The personal friendship of Mozart and von Born may be implied from the fact that the great composer wrote a short cantata, M aurerjreude, dated April 20, 1785, which was performed at a special banquet of the Lodge, Zur wahren Eintrachi, to celebrate von Born's discovery of a method of working ores by amalgama- tion. Mozart was proposed as a candidate for Freemasonry by Baron von Gemmingen, and later the composer per- suaded his father to join the Order.

He suggested that The Magic Flute was the swan song of Austrian Freemasonry. The Queen of the Night represented Maria Theresa, who was openly opposed to Masonry; Tamino, the hero of the opera, the liberal and friendly Joseph II who favored the Craft; Pamina, the heroine of the fantasy, the upper classes of Austria; the blackamoor, Monostatos, the black-robed Jesuits or monastic Orders; and the clowns, Papageno and Papagena, the peasantry of Austria. The high priest of the Rites of Isis and Osiris was von Born. The sudden entry of the Queen of the Night and Mono- statos into the Temple of Isis and Osiris may have re- ferred to the occasion on which the empress actually forced her way into one of the Masonic Lodges. Monostatos could also have caricatured Leopold Aloys Hoffmann, a Masonic traitor, who, after being befriended and helped by several Lodges, including his own, persuaded the government that the Freemasons were organizing a revolution against the crown. He was partially responsible for the closing of the Masonic Lodges of Austria. In an article which appeared in 1794, von Batzko inter- preted The Magic Flute according to the letter of the Illuminist doctrine. The Queen of the Night was super- stition; Pamina, enlightenment, the child of the Queen and pa triarchial religion (now deceased); Sarastro, reason. The sevenfold circles of the sun were true knowledge or conviction; Monostatos was the human passions; and Prince Tamino, the man of might whose spirituality was not yet perfected by trial and ordeal.

Although Bradley gave this summary and considered it more elaborate than con- sistent with the conditions under which The Magic Flute was produced, he appended von Batzko's significant words: \"Those who are members of this order will know and understand.\" Remembering that to the members of the Illuminati and their cryptic geography Egypt always signi- fied Austria, it seems certain that von Born as Sarastro, and further as the symbol of reason, belonged to the psycho- political thinking of Adam Weishaupt and Baron von Knigge. Mozart died in 1791, leaving an estate of only sixty florins. He was buried in the black dress of the Masonic Brotherhood, and his last cantata was published by his Masonic Lodge for the benefit of his widow and children. A heavy storm so disrupted the funeral that no record was kept of the location of his grave. He is believed to have been buried in the pauper's field. There is some mystery about this which has never been completely resolved. Cagliostro and the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry A controversy has raged for more than a century and a half over the man who proudly proclaimed himself to be the Count di Cagliostro, Grand Cophte of the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry. The facts have never been of interest to his detractors, and the popular accounts are of slight value to anyone. The flamboyant count was a hero of the French people at a time when the affection of the populace was certain to bring down upon its object the animosity of the Church and State. If Cagliostro's memory"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94 THE ADEPTS suffered from the reports circulated by the Inquisition, it bred no better when entrusted to the gentle keeping of such literary figures as Thomas Carlyle and Alexandre Dumas pere. A life of Cagliostro was issued under the auspices of the Apostolic Chamber. This august body, happily inspired by rumors circulated by Le Courrier de l'Europe, decided that the \"benefactor of the people,\" whose portrait influen- tial ladies carried on their fans, was in truth a Sicilian adventurer, one Giuseppe Balsamo, wanted by the police of Sicily for several crimes, including participation in an assassination plot. A fickle world, with a relish for gossip and reluctant to suspect good where ill was possible, took the Balsamo legend to its breast and has cuddled it there ever since. The present century has found a new excuse for assuming that Cagliostro was an impostor. The reason- ing is simple and empiric. The count claimed to possess supernatural or at least superphysical powers and faculties. This in itself justifies his condemnation without further investigation. Trowbridge,* one of the few to take the unpopular side of the controversy, was inspired to a dramatic summary of the case: \"After having been riddled with abuse til he was unrecognizable, prejudice, the foster child of calumny, proceeded to lynch him, so to speak, for over one hundred years his character was dangled on the gibbet of infamy, upon which the sbirri of tradition have inscribed a curse upon anyone who shall attempt to cut him down. His fate has been his fame. He is remembered in history, not so much for anything he did, as for what was done to him.\" As Trowbridge astutely pointed out, nobody who had ever met Balsamo ever knew, recognized, or even saw him as 'See Cagllostro, t hr Splendour and Misery of a Master of Magic."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 95 Cagliostro. Balsamo was \"wanted\" by the police of both London and Paris, but the gendarmery and all the secret agents employed to discover unsavory characters were re- markably slow to suspect that the genial, well-publicized, and, according to his enemies, notorious Alessandro Caglio- stro was really the despicable Balsamo. With all his enemies at work night and day to accomplish his undoing, it seems strange that the simplest means of discrediting the count were not pressed more effectively. In any event, no one ever emerged from Cagliostro's past to compromise him. I t would be difficult to reconcile the mental levels of the two men. When last officially examined, Balsamo was a typical rascal, uncultured and uncouth. There was little to suggest that he would acquire distinction as a man of letters or as a proficient in obscure arts and sciences. Even had he resolved thus to enlarge his faculties, this Balsamo would have required a long period of conditioning, He could scarcely have attained a superlative education with- out someone, somewhere, remembering the circumstances and reporting them to the anxious authorities. Had Caglio- stro really been Balsamo and had he remained obscure, he might have escaped recognition, but not after the count's picture had become a household furnishing, and reasonable facsimilies of his face, cast in bronze and plaster or carved in marble, had been everywhere exhibited. Cagliostro was condemned by the Inquisitional Court as having incurred the censures and penalties pronounced against heretics, dogmatics, heresiarchs, and propagators of magic and superstition. He was found guilty and con- demned to the censures and penalties against all persons who, in any manner whatever, favored or formed Societies and conventicles of Freemasonry, as well as by the edicts of the Council of State against all persons convicted of this"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 THE ADEPTS crime in Rome or in any other place of the dominions of the Pope.* The Inquisitional Office would scarcely have pronounced a sentence that was certain to cause grave criticism in Protestant countries and with the powerful Masonic Orders had less controversial grounds been available. If Cagliostro was Giuseppe Balsamo, why was he not tried for the crimes of this man and openly prosecuted on legitimate charges? To convict a man to perpetual imprisonment for founding a Masonic Lodge within the boundaries of the papal State could scarcely have been a popular procedure on the eve of the French Revolution. Had the count actually been an evil character with a reputation for crime and imposture, these more pertinent and devastating offenses would have ruined his standing before the world, and his esoteric lean- ings would have had slight bearing upon the administration of justice. Even de Morande, a spy, blackmailer, unprincipled jour- nalist, and editor of Le Courrier de r Europe, admitted that Cagliostro was initiated into Freemasonry in London, April 12, 1777. On this occasion the count identified him- self as a colonel of the 3rd Regiment of Brandenburg. Trowbridge said that Cagliostro's Masonic certificate was for some time in a famous collection of autographs belong- ing to the Marquis of Chateaugiron. The Esperance Lodge, which was Cagliostro's mother Lodge, was affiliated with the Order of Strict Observance. Trowbridge also found evidence that the count was admitted as a Freemason into a Lodge of the Order of Strict Observance at The Hague, and it is intimated that he received Masonic degrees in Germany. De Morande attempted to belittle Cagliostro's Masonic standing by intimating that the members of the Loge *See Cagltostro and His Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry, by Henry Ridgley Evans."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 97 d' Esperance were, for the most part, insignificant persons from the humbler trades and crafts of Soho. The count promptly replied that he was proud to be acknowledged a Brother of good and honorable men, and it had not occurred to him to check their financial or social standing. At least, it is established with certainty that the count was a Freemason and had been duly and properly initiated into the Order.* The founding of the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry was shrouded in mystery. Several lines of research have sug- gested themselves to Masonic historians. One group is con- vinced that Cagliostro's Rite was derived from a cabalistic Masonry introduced in 1754 by the mystical philosopher, Martines de Pasqually. Perhaps Pasqually was a Portu- guese Jew. In any event, his Masonic researches were strongly influenced by the esoteric traditions of that race, and the initiates of his Rite were called Cohens, which is the Hebrew word for priest. In Paris, in 1768, he attracted an influential circle of scholarly persons. Later, he in- herited properties in the West Indies, and died in Port-au- Prince. The Inquisition claimed that, while in London, Cagliostro acquired a manuscript by one, George Coston, which he amplified and enriched by his own researches. If so, this Coston was a product of Pasqually's thinking, for this cabalist had many followers and admirers in England. In fairness to Cagliostro, attention should be given to his own account of his origin and destiny. The story, though generally dismissed as fiction, never has been disproved. The count claimed to have been instructed in the esoteric arts by Arabian Masters. His parents were Christians of noble family, who had died when their illustrious son was ~[n compiling this paragraph, we are indebted to the researches of Henry Ridgley Evans, who, in turn, derived his material from Cagliostro in Eastern Europe, etc., by B.

Cagliostro was never told the name of his father, but was attended by a most learned tutor named Althotas, who was a Master of secret and mysterious arts. Althotas took the boy to Mecca in his twelfth year and presented him to the Grand Sherif. At that time, Cagliostro had no name other than Acharat, by which he was known in Medina. He remained three years in Mecca, then went to Egypt where he explored the pyramids. After three more years in Africa and Asia, he arrived at the island of Rhodes where he was entertained by Emmanuele Pinto, Grand Master of the Knights of Malta. Pinto, a man of despotic methods, became Grand Master in 1741 and gained distinction for resisting papal encroachments on his authority. Cagliostro assisted him in alchemical and medical researches. Althotas died at Malta, and it was on this island that Acharat first assumed European dress and took the name of Count di Cagliostro. According to Eliphas Levi, the name Althotas encloses the word thot (Thoth), the Egyp- tian god of wisdom, and the prefix al, implying God or divine, suggests that the true teacher of the bizarre count was the divine mind. Althotas could also be the name given to an initiate of the Mysteries at the time of his eleva- tion. It has been suggested that Althotas was really the elusive Dr. Kolmer, who gave instructions in magic to Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Bavarian Illuminati. Alexander Wilder has noted that the word cagliostro is made up of Kalos, meaning beautiiul, and Aster, a star or sun. The tie between Cagliostro and the Illuminati was as interesting as his possible association with the Knights Templars. The Inquisitional reports showed that Cagliostro confessed during his trial that he had been initiated into"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 99 the Illuminati in an underground cave near Frankfort-on- the-Main. Some writers have hazarded the speculation that the Illuminati or the Templars supplied Cagliostro with at least part of the funds with which he was usually so well-provided. The Illuminist rituals, as expanded by Weishaupt and von Knigge, certainly had strong Egyptian coloring, but there is evidence that Cagliostro was well- advanced in his own project before his direct contact with the Bavarian group. Some historians suggest that Egyptian Masonry was intro- duced into Europe about 1771 by a merchant of Jutland who had been in Egypt, and had also visited Malta where he could have contacted Cagliostro. The doctrines of the Jutland merchant were based upon the teachings of Manes. In the course of introducing his own Rite, the count also revealed a remarkable knowledge of the obscure doctrines of Emanuel Swedenborg. Cagliostro claimed, while using the name Count Sutkowski, that he was the messenger of a Swedenborgian Secret Society existing in A vignon. While Cagliostro proved before a group of French in- tellectuals, including the distinguished Court de Gebe1in, that he was an accomplished Egyptologist, the Egyptian Rite does not include any profound exposition of the re- ligion or philosophy of ancient Egypt. It is surprising, indeed, that so little is known about Cagliostro's esoteric teachings. His lectures to the more advanced members of his Rite were probably not included in the surviving manu- scripts. The Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry is the only ritual of the period, however, which actually included transcendental experiments and formulas.

The actual rituals of the Egyptian Rite were not by any means so fantastic as the accounts published by Guillaune Figuier and the Marquis de Luchet. It is possible that some of the glamour of the French court penetrated into the sanctuaries of the Egyptian Rite, but, if so, such spec- tacles were limited to a few Lodges composed mostly of courtiers and their ladies. Actually the Egyptian Rite, with certain exceptions- mostly symbolical or philosophical-was no more bizarre than the so-called regular Lodges. The actual record of Cagliostro's activities, if judged impartially, revealed that, in spite of the absurd reports circulated concerning him, the Count was a humanitarian of parts, a champion of the exploited masses, a practical idealist, and a teacher of a highly ethical, constructive, and moral philosophy.

He wrote extensively on mystical, magical, numerological, and alchemical subjects, and even contributed works on drama, politics, and art criticism. These brought him considerable distinction, but their popularity has not endured. Only The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary, translated by Isabelle de Steiger, is available in English. The Aulic Councilor was the natural son of Count Karl of Haimbhausen. His mother, who died in giving birth 'to the boy, was the daughter of a superintendent of the count's estates. Although his father was most solicitous and affectionate and did everything in his power to advance the lad's fortunes, von Eckartshausen was extremely sen- sitive about his illegitimacy, and this unfortunate circum- stance burdened his entire life with a deep but gentle despondency. He received an excellent education in philos- ophy and law, was made Aulic Councilor to the Elector, Karl Theodore, was attached in honorable position to the library of Munich, and later was nominated keeper of the archives of the Electoral House. Although he had political enemies, his honors were preserved because his outstanding virtues and abilities endeared him to the Elector. The mystical writings of von Eckartshausen were, to a large degree, influenced by Roman Catholicism, but the gentle and beautiful spirit of the works has endeared them to thoughtful persons of many religious convictions.

But it has not been recorded that his interests caused him anv difficulties with the Church. Few details are available about von Eckartshausen's asso- ciation with the Esoteric Societies of his time. The Cata- logue of the library of Dorbon-aire, under No. 1030, describes a manuscript written at the beginning of the 19th century and stated to be by von Eckartshausen, One page of this manuscript contains three pen-drawn and hand- colored vignettes. The first is the moon in two of its quarters; the second is the pentacle of Solomon; and the third is the emblem of the Rosy Cross. The last would suggest a possible familiarity with the activities of this Society. The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary consists of a series of six letters addressed generally to \"my dear brothers in the Lord.\" The second letter contains the most remarkable account of the Secret School of the adepts to be found in mystical literature. Naturally, Mr. Waite objects to the obvious meaning and attempts to confuse the issue by imply- ing that Eckartshauscn \"is only a peg on which to hang the high considerations of eternity\"-whatever that may mean. 'While space does not permit, or the need require, a complete reprint of von Eckartshausen's second letter, there are several paragraphs which advance the present labor. \"It is necessary, my dear brothers in the Lord, to give you a clear idea of the interior Church; of that illuminated Community of God which is scattered throughout the world, but is governed by one truth and united in one spirit.

From all time there has been an exterior school based on the interior one, of which it is but the outer expression. From all time, therefore, there has been a hidden assembly, a society of the Elect, of those who sought for and had capacity for light, and this interior society was called the interior Sanctuary or Church .... \"The interior Church was formed immediately after the fall of man, and received from God at first-hand the revela- tion of those means by which fallen humanity could be again raised to its rights and delivered from its miseries.

It is a society which unites superior power to its own, and includes members from more than one world. It is the society whose mem- bers form a theocratic republic, which one day will be the Regent Mother of the whole World.\" It is useless for Mr. Waite to suggest that von Eckart- shausen's letter is to be understood only as referring sym- bolically to a personal exaltation of consciousness, The Aulic Councilor was fully aware of the adept tradition and, writing in 1790, refers to \"these sages, whose number is small.\" He later mentions that \"they live in various parts of the earth .... Some live in Europe, others in Africa, but they are bound together by the harmony of their souls, and they are therefore as one. They are joined together, although they may be thousands of miles apart from each other. They understand each other, although they speak in different tongues, because the language of the sages is spiritual perception. \".X- Precisely the same implication appears in the writings of Paracelsus, who says: \"There are persons who have been exalted to God, and who have remained in that state of exaltation, and they have not died. Their physical bodies have lost their lives, but without being conscious of it, with- out sensation, without any disease, and without suffering, *See Disclosures of Magic, quoted in the appendix of Paracelsus, by Franz Hartmann."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106 THE ADEPTS and their bodies became transformed, and disappeared in such a manner that nobody knew what became of them, and yet they remained on the earth.\"* It is evident from the writings of von Eckartshausen and those other mystics with whom he was directly or indirectly associated that the adept tradition descended into that assembly of esotericists responsible for certain important innovations which affected the descent of the Orders of Freemasonry. Baron Kirchberger sought to secure from von Eckartshausen the personal communication of the Lost Word, as the baron himself testified. This in itself reveals the facts with sufficient clarity. There is proof enough that the tradition survived the political complications resulting from the program of Universal Reformation, and reap- peared in the Orders of Fraternity. The French Transcendentalists The descent of the esoteric tradition in France presents few historical landmarks prior to the rise of Freemasonic speculation in the second half of the 18th century. Before this time, there were occasional outstanding names, usually connected with alchemy or with speculations derived from the doctrines of the Knights Templars. Initiates from other countries visited France and left various mementos of their activities, but such secret Orders as endured in the country found it expedient to remain obscure. The most famous and dramatic of the French transcen- dentalists was Abbe Alphonse Louis Constant, who wrote under the Hebraistic pseudonym, Eliphas Levi Zahad. He was born in Paris in 1809 or 1810, the son of a poor and unschooled shoemaker. He showed early promise of mental 'See Philosophic,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 107 brilliance, and received a free education at the Seminary of St. Sulpice through the efforts of the cure of the parish. Alphonse was an excellent student; took minor orders, and finally became a deacon. Then suddenly, for reasons not entirely clear but probably doctrinal, he was expelled from St. Sulpice and came under the disfavor of the Church. The departure of Alphonse from the Seminary aroused considerable speculation among his biographers. Some suspected that he showed an early addiction to what the clergy might reasonably regard as diabolical arts. Others suggested that the young deacon had committed his mind to the doctrines of Rousseau, Voltaire, and other intellectual liberals. This seems the more likely as one of his early writings, The Gospel of Liberty, was sufficiently socialistic to result in six months' imprisonment. Endeavors to trace the source of Eliphas Levi's esoteric knowledge have been seriously hampered because of insuffi- cient biographical material. After an unhappy marriage which terminated in 1847, Levi devoted himself completely to the esoteric arts and sciences, and published several works on these subjects. These writings reveal an extensive knowl- edge of the history and philosophy of magic and the lives of the principal exponents of mystical subjects from the earliest times. His use of reference material, however, did not always indicate a solid familiarity with the authorities to which he referred or from whose writings he quoted. Levi had a basic concept of transcendentalism which he unfolded according to his own convictions. He used the works of other authors only to advance his own peculiar purposes. He must have had access to many rare and curious books, and he wrote with a strong, mystical quality of certainty. His style was dogmatic, dramatic, and fasci- nating. He was an artist of great skill and vivid imagina-"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108 THE ADEPTS tion. The diagrams and figures with which he embellished his manuscripts were inspired by the works of earlier eso- tericists, but he developed them with genius and artistry. The Magus, as he was called, depended largely on a circle of private students for the perpetuation of his mes- sage. Many of those who associated themselves with him were of high position and superior attainments. He left volumes of manuscripts and reams of letters, which were collected with loving care by his disciples. A number of Levi's unpublished works were copied by his students. Among the most industrious of these copyists should be mentioned Nowakowihi and the Baron Spedalieri. Eliphas Levi departed from this life in 1875. Although he had long been at variance with the Church on points of doctrine, he received the last sacraments and died in the bosom of the faith. Waite reproduced a photograph of Levi lying in state with a large crucifix on his breast. One of the faithful disciples of Eliphas Levi describes the Magus in these words: \"He was of a short and corpulent figure; his face was kind and benevolent, beaming with good nature, and he wore a long, gray beard which covered nearly the whole of his breast. His apartment resembled a bric-e-brae shop, with specimens of the most beautiful and rare old china, tapestry, and valuable paintings. In one of the rooms there was an alcove in which stood a bed covered with a gorgeous quilt of red velvet bordered with massive gold fringe, and a red velvet step stood before this magnificent couch, having a soft cushion also of red and gold laid on the top of it He lived a quiet and retired life, having few friends He had a wonderful memory, and a marvelous flow of language, his expressions and illustrations being of the choicest and rarest character.\""},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 109 After the impetus given by Eliphas Levi, those who had imbibed deeply of his doctrine attempted a restoration of ancient mystical Orders and esoteric arts in France. About 1889, the Marquis Stanislas de Guaita created a cabalistic Rosicrucian Fraternity. Later, Dr. Gerard Encausse, better known as Papus, became the head of this group which included such distinguished names as Sal' Peladen and Paul Christian. These men, in their search for inspiration drew generously from the traditions of Martinism and the manu- scripts left by Levi. There is agreement among the in- formed that at some time in the eventful life of the Magus he had contacted the Secret Schools. 'When the disciple is found, the Master is not far away. Kenneth Mackenzie, IXo, a member of the English Rosicrucian research group, knew Eliphas Levi quite inti- mately. He described him as a man of genius and learning, and \"a member of the Brotherhood of Light, or Fratres Lucis/ Although such a membership would violate the supposed historical boundaries of the Fratres Lucis, there is nothing to prove that this Order did not survive among a small group of initiated esotericists.* Mrs. Isabel Cooper-Oakley, who did so much research into the activities of the mysterious Comte de St.-Germain, was able to examine manuscript records of the Fratres Lucis, or the Wise, Mighty and Reverend Order of the Knights or Brothers of Light, which were for a time in the files of the Imperial Library of Petrograd. Although the Order claimed that it was founded in the year 40 A. D. under the patronage of St. John the Evange- list, no records of its independent existence were known prior to 1781. In the Wilkoroki manuscripts examined by Mrs. Cooper-Oakley, there were references to the Seven *Sce The Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia, ctc., article \"Levi.\""},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"110 THE ADEPTS 'Vise Fathers, Heads of the Seven Churches of Asia. Were not these Seven Wise Fathers of the East the adepts of the Secret Schools? As Mr. Waite points out: \"The Order comes therefore before us as that of a Hidden Church or Holy Assembly, ex hypothesi like that of Eckartshausen, but passing into substituted manifestation by virtue of its ceremonial workings.\"·x, No consideration of the forces molding the early life of Levi would be complete without mention of an incident which occurred on a certain morning in 1839.t An eccen- tric character name Alphonse Esquiros arrived at Levi's sanctum with an invitation to call upon the Mapah, a mysterious, bearded man of majestic demeanor and beauti- ful, mystic face, who held spiritual court in a squalid Paris garret. The Mapah, whose real name was Ganneau, wore the tattered cloak of a woman over his clothes, and con- veyed the impression of a destitute dervish. This strange prophet believed himself to be the reincarnation of Louis XVII, who had returned to save the world. The Mapah was surrounded by several other entranced persons as weird and ecstatic as himself. Levi preserved several extracts from the words of the Mapah on that occasion. \"From the first hour of the Fall, the task of humanity has been ... a great and terrible task of initiation. For this also the terms of that initiation are all equally sacred in the eyes of God. There Alpha is our common mother Eve, while the Omega is Liberty, who is our common mother also.\" According to the account left by Levi, it was a disciple of the Mapah whose fanatical conduct directly precipitated the French Revolution of 1848. There may be more to the story of the Mapah than appeared on the surface. Levi certainly did not invent his transcendental doctrines, \"See The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross. tS ee History of Magic."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORDERS OF FRATERNITY 111 although he dressed them in a literary form entirely his own. He referred obscurely to his entry upon a \"fateful path,\" and discussed the mysteries of initiation as one party to the facts. Levi derived great comfort and inspiration from the life and writings of the German mystical alchemist, Heinrich Khunrath. It is known to members of Esoteric Orders that Khunrath had received initiation, but had not attained the highest grade. His Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae, or Amphitheater of Eternal Wisdom, published in Hanover in 1609, is illustrated with a series of magnificent symbolic plates. Levi interpreted these figures and the text that accompanied them according to his own cabalistical con- victions, and seems to have arrived at profound, if unortho- dox, opinions regarding their true meanings. The philos- ophy of this French Magus was founded on the concept of a secret, esoteric teaching which descended from the most ancient times, flourished in Egypt, passed then to Greece, and finally was absorbed into the structure of the mystic Christian Church. There is sufficient internal evi- dence in Levi's writings to justify his inclusion among the disciples of the Esoteric Schools. The French esoteric groups which stemmed from the teachings of Levi have left a valuable heritage of occult lore. Unfortunately, however, they were born out of time, for their magical speculations belonged to an earlier cycle of alchemy, transcendentalism, and the cabala. Levi's interpretations of Masonic rituals and symbols influenced American Freemasonry through the writings of Albert Pike, who quoted and paraphrased many of the works of the French Magus, but was wise enough to refrain from identi- fying the highly controversial source of his information.

The trend is away from the marvelous and the miraculous, and toward the useful and the necessary. The Great School and its initiates have discarded the cloak of Hermetic fables, and have selected their new symbolism from the collective emergen- cies of contemporary living. The universal truths of the secret doctrine are stated in terms of politics, industry, economics, management, and labor. International accord, the arbitration of religious and social differences, and the systematic advancement of the plan for world welfare supply the ingredients of a new application of Hermetic chemistry. Thus the plan unfolds, the principles remain the same, the needs enlarge, and the mortal crisis is perpetual. Three thousand years ago Memphis of the White Walls was the college-city of the Egyptian adepts. Here the initiates governed their school according to divine and universal laws. Memphis was the archetype of the World City, the union of nations, the one world-the Philosophic Common- wealth which is to come. The goal of the Secret Schools is the revelation in the sphere of mortal activity of the design of the Invisible College. The very earth itself is to be the campus; nations and States, the classrooms; humanity, the student body; those dedicated to essential progress, the teachers; and the eternal sciences and arts revealed by God through Nature, the curriculum. Until all men of \"towardness\" recognize both their responsibilities and their opportunities, the work of the Secret Schools is not finished. The day will come when that which has been taught under oath and obligation shall belong equally and freely to all men, not because it has been brought down to them, but because they themselves have been raised up by vision and experience and have claimed their eternal heritage."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"For complete information, including a Catalog visit our website at http://www.uprs.edu UNIVERSITY OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH 3910 Los Feliz Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90027 e-mail | registrar@uprs.edu phone | 800.548.4062 fax | 323.663.9443 A CONTEMPORARY WISdOM A CAdEMY UPR utilizes universally accessible online and telecommu- •\t nication technologies to teach its graduate courses Learn in your free time and wherever you can access •\t the Internet and/or a Cd player Enjoy the privilege of interacting with the world’s •\t leading teachers of wisdom Online learning keeps tuition at affordable rates •\t UNIVERSITY of PHILOSOPHICAL R ESEARCH TRANSFORM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AN d YOUR LIFE | In today’s global postmodern world, a holistic, multicultural, evolutionary and spiritual perspective is a necessity in every life enterprise .
