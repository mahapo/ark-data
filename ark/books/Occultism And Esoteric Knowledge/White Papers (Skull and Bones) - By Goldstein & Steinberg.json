It explains the thinking behind America's m ilitary adventure in the Persian Gulf and its current attitudes toward the Middle East region. In so doing, we provide a gl impse into the most powerful organization in America--the Order of Skull & Bones. This se cret fraternity is based at Ya le University in New Haven, Connecticut, where many of th e leading members of the U.S. government and the American intelligence community received their formal educ ation. The Order, as it is referred to by its members, is a bastion of White Angl o Saxon Protestant (WASP) culture, which is at the core of the American 20th century outlook. The reader will learn that Pre sident George Herbert Walker Bush's concept of the New World Order is an old idea, one which has its origins in the philosophy and beliefs of the secret Skull & Bones fraternity . Today in particular, this is the prevailing outlook of the U.S. government, many of whose most influential members, like the president himself, are part of the Skull & Bone s network. These men seek to recreate the American imperium of the immediate post-World War II period, an era wh ich President Bush frequently refers to as \"the American Century.\" The powerful men of Skull & Bones genuinely believe that they have a strategic and moral \"right\" to control worl d affairs. Consequently, they take upon themselves the authority to crush any rivalrous threat to U.S. imperial leadersh ip, whether by current allies, such as Japan, Germa ny or Great Britain, or by Co ld War adversaries, like the Soviet Union. The members of the Order, due to their narrow WASP upbringing, view with particular suspic ion the maneuverings of Zionist Is rael and its affluent, influential lobb y in the United States."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Bush, his fellow Bonesmen a nd their like-thinking elitis t allies in the American Establishment see themselves as New World Order warriors, an American samurai caste of sorts, whose mission is restoring Americ an greatness. They in tend to utilize the institutional networks of the U.S. government and key privat e agencies, such as the New York Council on Fore ign Relations, to a dvance their purpose. The Skull & Bones members believe in the idea of \"construc tive chaos.\" By keeping their true policy intentions secret, by constantly sending out mixed signals on all critical policy issues, they consciously seek to sow confusion among both their nominal \"friends\" and \"enemies\" alike. The fulcrum for the policy of c onstructive chaos is, at present, the Middle East situation. Although U.S. military action in the region has for the time being subsided, America's military power will remain a cr itical determinant in the futu re of that vital zone of conflict. American military pow er is aimed at secu ring undisputed control over the vast reservoir of oil -- not at neces sarily fostering any permanent alignment of local states or combinations of regional interests. If President George Bush and his fellow true believers are successf ul, the United States will be first among equals in the New World Order. This is their goal. It is also the quest of the Bonesmen of the Orde r of Skull & Bones -- Amer ica's warrior aristocracy. THE ORDER OF SKULL & BONES Skull & Bones was founde d at Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut in 1832. It is the oldest and most prestigious of Yale's seven secret societies. Among the others are: Scroll & Key, Book & Snake, Wolf's Head, Eliahu, and Berzelius. These fraternities serve as a recruiting ground for young men destined fo r careers in government, law, finance and other influential s ectors of American life. Skull & Bones is the e lite of the elite among these secret societies. Only Scroll & Key ca n claim a near equal in fluence on American affairs over the past 160 years. Unlike the Greek fraternities on most other American un iversity campuses, Skull & Bones and its similar secret so cieties exist exclusively at Ya le. They are not part of any nationwide public associatio n. The other elite Ivy League colleges, Harvard and Princeton have similar exclusive secret societie s. Yet, even among these few universities, the secret societies of Yale -- led by Skull & Bones -- are unchallenged in their influence on American political affairs. According to some accounts , the Skull & Bones secret society at Yale has an under g round affiliation with two other societies which were simultaneousl y founded at"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"two other locations. The number \"322\" that appears under the skull and crossbones on the Order's emblem is believed to i ndicate the year of its founding -- 1832 -- and the fact that it is the second lodge with in an international system. By some accounts, the lodge holding the number \"1\" is in Germany and the lodge numbered \"3\" is based at another American college. Since its founding, Skull & Bones has only inducted about 2,500 me mbers. At any given time, only about 600 or so members of the Order are alive. This small number underscores the tremendous concentration of power in the hands of its members. If the members of Skull & Bo nes were to select a Hall of Fame from among their own elite ranks, some of the peop le whose names would almost ce rtainly appear at the top of the list would be: z Alphonso Taft, a founding member of the Or der who served as th e Secretary of War under President Rutherford B. Hayes (1876-1880). z William Howard Taft, the only man to ever serve as both the President of and Chief Justice of the United St ates Supreme Court. z Henry Lewis Stimson, partner in the Wall Street law firm of Root and Stimson, Secretary of War under President Taft (1908-1912), Governor General of the Philippines (1926-1928), Secr etary of State under Presi dent Herbert Hoover (1929- 1933) and Secretary of War under Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman (1940-1946). z Averell Harriman, investment banker with Brown Brothers Harriman, director of the Lend-Lease program of the U.S. St ate Department (1 941-1942), U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1943- 1946), Governor of New York, Under Secretary of State for Asia (1961-1963), and pr esidential secret envoy to Soviet leaders Stalin, Krushchev, Brezhnev and Andropov. z Robert Lovett, partner in Brown Brothers Harriman, Assistant Secretary of War for Air (1941-1945), Deputy Se cretary of Defense, Secr etary of Defense (1950), leading member of th e New York Council on Foreign Relations. z Harold Stanley, investment banker , founder of Morgan Stanley. z Robert A.

Acco rding to one version of the Order's founding, it was an out growth of an earlier Britis h or Scottish freemasonic grouping first established at All Soul's College at Oxford University in the late 17th century. Another version of the history of Skull & Bones is that it grew out of the German \"nationalistic\" secret .s ocieties of the early 19th centur y. Still a third explanation is that Skull & Bones is an uniquely American instituti on which adopted some of the rituals of European freemasonry , but molded these rituals an d beliefs into a new form. Regardless of these conflicting accounts, it can be stated with certainty that the Order was first established on the Yale campus in 1832 It was officia lly incorporated only in 1856 under the name Russell Trust Association. According to virtuall y all the available biographical data on its earl y members, the money required to sustain the secret order's campus affairs and its broader role in placi ng its members into key positions of influence upon their graduation from Yale , derived from the opium trade in the Far East. That trade was set up by the British East India Company and was flourish ing by the time the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783 en ding the American War for I ndependence. The East India Company during this period was controlled by the Baring Brothers Bank (Toward the closing decades of the 17th ce ntury, the British House of Ro thschild would supplant the Baring Brothers as the cont rolling financial interests in the China opium trade. Through the sponsorship of th e Barings and also the Rothsc hilds, a number of leading N ew England families, some of whom had sided with Great Britain during the American Revolution, were brought into the opium trade as junior partners. These merchant families ran fleets of clipper ships and became in many cases fabulou sly wealthy as the result of their association with the British East India Company. Among these key New England merchant families were: Cabot, C oolidge, Forbes, Higginson, Sturgis, Lodge, Lowell, Perkins and Russell. These New England merchant families fou nded the United Fruit Company and the Bank of Boston. The founding families of Skull & Bones included the Russell and Perkins families, Over several genera tions, however, all these fam ilies heavily intermarried and became, in effect, one ex tended power grouping. William Huntington Russell incorporated Skull & Bones as the Russell Trust Association. Throughout the 20th century, the Russell Trus t Association listed the New York City headquarters of Brown Br others Harriman as its address. Russell was valedictorian of his class at Yale in 1833 . He and his Skull & Bones comrades considered themselv es to be a special elite am ong the merchant banking and Puritan pil g rim elite of Yale. The y took the Puritan beliefs of the earl y New En g land"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"settlers, that they were \"ele cted by God,\" and pre-ordain ed to rule North America. The founding of Yale Coll ege in 1701 pre-dates the Am erican Revolution by several generations. Many of the found ers of Yale were righteous men of the Puritan heritage who devoutly believed in God and country. Some of these patriotic souls later made up the core of Benjamin Frankl in's political coalition whic h ultimately broke with the mother country, Great Britain . Many graduates of Yale we re active in the American Revolution and the founding of the United States. Two critics of the Order, historian Antony Sutton and investiga tive journalist Ron Rosenbaum (himself a Yale graduate), both concluded that Skull & Bones has degenerated since its founding and has taken on more of the occult and ritualistic trappings of the majority of European freema sonic and Illuminati secr et societies. Sutton charges that the Orde r is secretly known among its initiates as the \"Brotherhood of Death\" and has become an evil instrument in the hands of America's secret power elite. Rosenbaum claims that the so ciety's Germanic origins are inherently wicked and pre- N azi. In a long 1977 article in Esquire magazine , Rosenbaum charged th at the Skull & Bones building on the Yale campus houses remnants from Hitler's private collection of silver. While these stories can not be dismissed out of hand, it must be noted that authors Rosenbaum and Sutton may be biased. As a young Jewish student at Yale, Rosenbaum was almost automatically excluded on religi ous grounds from the i nner sanctum of the campus's secret societies. Sutton, a British- born eccentric historian, proudly admits his strong British biases, frequently citing philo sopher John Stuart Mill as the spiritual mentor in his book on the Order. Despite the possible personal bi ases in these two accounts of the history of the Order of Skull & Bones, it must be acknowledged that the membersh ip of the society has tended over generations to converge upon a small group of New England families who have intermarried and then sponsored their sons and nephews into the Or der. This kind of inbreeding always tends to pr oduce narrow-mindedn ess and prejudice against outsiders, which can be a serious shortcoming, partic ularly among individuals responsible for charting the course of a nation as powerful as the United States. It can be documented by compar ing the family charts of the early Bonesmen that there is today a core group of no more than 20 to 30 families who form the nucleus of the Order. The majority are old-line Pur itan families who cam e to North America in the very first wave of settlers in the 17th century. Among these prominent families are: Whitney, Lord, Phelps. Wadsworth, Allen, Bu ndy, Adams, Stimson, Taft, Gilman and Perk ins. A second group of families in the Skull & Bones core earned fabulous fortunes during the 18th and 19th centuries and thus won a rite of passa ge into the New Engla nd elite, even though they were not among the earl iest settlers. The leading Sku ll & Bones families in this second cate g or y are: Harriman, Rockefeller, Pa y ne, Davison, Pillsbur y and We y erhauser."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" A few of the Jewish banking families who made their way fr om Germany to the United States during the 18th and l9th centuries were eventually granted limited access to the WASP inner sanctums. Some families, like th e Schiff, Warburg, Guggenheim and Meyer families, were unofficially designated as intermediaries betw een the New England WASPs and their cousins in Lo ndon. This was especially true after the Rothschild interests supplanted the Anglic an Baring group as the most powerful financial cabal in the City of London. Some of these German Jewish families be came so absorbed into the WASP or Anglican society that they eventua lly converted from Juda ism to Protestantism and were gradually ostracized from the Jewish aristocracy. The WASP families, however, never saw the prominent Je wish investment banking families of America as equals . The Jews were considered politically and culturally different by the WASPs, and have never been accepted into the latter's inner circle. For the most part, these Jewish me rchant bankers are viewed with suspicion and distrust by the members of the Order. More over, the Jewish fraternal soci eties, such as B'nai B'rith, were formed out of the British-based Sco ttish Rite Freemasonry. Their sponsors in America, the Rothschilds and the Cecil Rhod es Trust (also known as the British Round Table Group), are conne cted with the British Foreign O ffice and its secret intelligence apparatus. INITIATION AND RITUAL To be initiated into the Order of Skull & Bones, on e must endure a ritual of selection called \"tapping\". It is conducted by 15 senior classmen of Yale Un iversity who make up the current membership of the secret society. They select 15 member s of the junior class to be the Bonesmen the following year. Hist orically, Skull & Bones kept blacks, Jews and all other non-WASPs from its ranks. Within the last 30 years, however, token members from these groups have been occasiona lly selected to join . Thus, in the most recent list of initiates to th e Order, there is one Yalie with a Jewish surname and even one with a Chinese name. Accordi ng to author Rosenbaum, in re cent years, the Order has inducted members of homosexual rights groups on the campus into its ranks. Among the criterion for selectio n -- apart from family ties to the order, which has always been an important factor -- is what is referred to by historia ns and members as the \"Three Ordeals.\" These ordeals are in tended to measure the prospe ctive Bonesman's ability to \"make it\" in the world beyo nd the university campus. The first ordeal is boarding school. The overw helming majority of Bonesmen, given their wealthy blueblood family pe digrees, attend one of th e prestigious New England p reparatory schools, i.e, priv ate high schools. (Whereas a larg e number of the most elite of the Harvard Universit y students attend Groton, a sc hool with close ties to the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Anglican-Episcopal Church, wh ere they receive a thoroughly Anglophilic education, the p referred prep schools fo r the future Bonesmen ar e the two Puritan Calvinis t -sponsored Phillips Academies.) The second of the ordeals is th at of nature. The prospectiv e Bonesmen are judged on their skills as outdoorsmen. Hunting in the New England countryside or , better yet, traveling to distant locations like Africa, th e jungles of South America or even the American badlands of the Plains states, is a prer equisite for admission to the Sp artan elite ranks of the Order. The third of the ordeals is war. The experience of combat dur ing wartime is considered to be of special significance fo r the Bonesmen, who see themselv es as the elite of the New England WASP warrior caste. Many Yale Bo nesmen of President George Bush's generation, as the resu lt of the outbreak of Wo rld War II, went directly from prep school into the military service prior to their en tering Yale. For a major ity of Bonesmen, the p referred military servi ce has historically been with th e U.S. Navy. During World II the N aval air corp was a particular ly important track for future Bones initiates. In peacetime, p articipation at Yale in military officer's training is desirable but not essential. The commitment to enter some bran ch of the military upon gra duation is viewed with favor. After the formal selection of the next gr oup of prospective Bonesmen, there is an invitation followed by a formal initiation ceremony. First the 15 senior class members who are the members of the Orde r select a group of junior class members who are to be \"tapped\" for Skull & Bones. A group of Bonesmen proceed to the dormitory room of the \"tappee.\" Upon reaching th e door, they pound loudly. Wh en the prospective member opens the door, a Bonesman w ill tap him on the shoulder and yell, \"Skull and Bones: Do you accept?\" If the candidate accepts, a message wrapped with a black ribbon sealed by black wax with the skull and crossbones emblem and the my stical Bones number 322 is handed to the \"tappee.\" The message appoints a time and a place for the candidate to appear on initiation night. Cand idates are instructed to wear no metal objects or clothing. According to a 1940 Skul l & Bones document, the in itiation ceremony involves the following kinds of things: \"New man placed in coffin -- carried in to central part of b uilding. New man chanted over and reborn into society. Removed from coffin and given robes with symbols on it . A bone with his name on it is to ssed into the b one heap at the start of every meeting.\" Within the Skull & Bones Crypt, also known as \"the Tomb,\" th ere is what is referred to as a \"sacred room\" with the nu mber 322, On the arched wall about the vault entrance is inscribed in German: \"Who wa s the fool, who was the wi se man, beggar or king? Whether poor or rich, all's the same in death.\" This quotation from a German Freemasonic ritual remain s a source of controversy surrounding the origins of Skul l & Bones. It is one of the bits of \"evidence\" cited by some of the Order's most ardent critics that the g roup is \"Nazi like\" and sin g ularl y"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"\"Germanic\". In fact, the ritual s of the Order are ve ry much like the rituals employed by Scottish and English freemasonic lodges. Some of the mystery and co nfusion surrounding these occu lt symbols and rituals is intentionally fostered by the Order itself. Among the principles taught to the members of the Yale secret society are the value of ambiguity and se crecy. These values are not taught as part of a pu rely mystical or occult quasi-relig ion. They are taught as valuable tools to be applied by the Bo nesmen when they leave the insulated environment of the Yale campus and become officials of gov ernment, the intelli gence community, the military or the private sector. A careful study of the often confusing and self-contradictory behavior and public statements of President Bush and his clos est advisers throughout the months of the Persian Gulf crisis of last year and war that followed offe rs a valuable example of how ambiguity and secrecy ar e applied by Bonesmen. For the initiates of the Order, the question of whether secrec y and ambiguity are used for the purpose of accomplishing \" good\" or \"evil\" is of seco ndary importance. Secrecy and ambiguity are essential instruments for wieldi ng power. The effec tive wielding of power is one of the overarching go als of all Bonesmen. The secr et ties built up during the Bonesmen's senior year of ac tive membership in the Order ar e maintained for life. Those ties link each Bonesman to every other initia te, especially to thos e initiates who were members of the Order in the same year. Thus, every member of Skull & Bones is, in real and practical terms, part of a small elite group of young Yale graduate s -- most from wealthy an d powerful WASP families -- who enter the world of politic s, business, finance, intelli gence or education and who p roceed to make their mark on the world. According to several sources, Pre sident George Bush to this day frequently consults with several of his fellow Yale Bo nesmen, and has, on occasion , called upon Skull & Bones members to carry out secret diplom atic missions for the White House. THE SPARTAN MODEL These rites of passage into the upper ranks of the WASP Establishmen t are capped by the experience the Bonesmen go throu gh in their final year at Yale -- the year in which they actively participate in the Or der. For the vast majority of the initiates, the process of inculcation with the id eas of WASP supremacy, an Americ an Calvinist version of what British imperialist writer Ru dyard Kipling called the \"White Man's Burden,\" began at p rep school. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"According to the biographical accounts of a number of th e leading Bonesmen, the prep school experience is paramount. At prep school, intelle ctual pursuits are encouraged, but special emphasis is also placed on athle tic performance. Future Yale Bonesmen are expected to excel in some te am sport, such as baseball and football, both American inventions. (Members of Skul l & Bones were involved in the development of both games.) Team sports supposed ly prepare the future Bonesm an to accept leadership responsibility, and more importantly, teach him to \"res pect the rules of the game.\" According to one biographer, when George Bush was a Yale undergraduate he was a member of the university ba seball team. Although he was ap parently not a very good baseball player, he eventually became captain of the Yale team. One day during the Yale baseball season, he excitedly vi sited his mother to proudly pr oclaim that he had hit his first home run. She reportedly looked back at him with pa trician coolness, and asked, \"Yes, George, but did your team win the game?\" The particular emphasis on team sports during the prep school and Ya le years is, according to several historians, pa rt of the Spartan training that is so essential to the Skull & Bones philosophy. In th e world of Skull & B ones, one of the grea test virtues is the ability to steer the nation into war an d to successfully prosecute the war. To the Bonesmen, the use of military power is a natural and esse ntial corollary to p olitical power. The Bonesmen are taught that , although ideas have their place, to truly transform history, military fo rce is almost always requir ed. Critics of the Order have p ointed out that this philosophy of power a nd the imperial use of military force comes straight from the chronicles of the Roman Em pire -- especially th e Roman Empire during its phase of decl ine and collapse. The criticism may prove to be most prophe tically true of the current generation of Bonesmen who are leading the United States under the presidency of George Bush. During the final phase of the Roman Empire, legions were de ployed out around the world to conquer and subjugate vast territories, wh ile back in Rome, th ere was a breakdown, a crisis in which the entire so cial and cultural fabric of the early Roman republic was eroding and giving way to some thing akin to the drug, rock-s ex counterculture of today. The Roman imperial policy of attempting to gloss over the decadence at home by engaging in constant wars of expansion led ultimately to the total collapse of Rome. In this regard, the Spartan- Roman imperial outlook of the American WASP warrior caste, exemplified by Skull & Bones, cannot be precisely compared to the Japanese samurai code of Bushido. The Japane se Bushido code em phasized honor among the warriors and p resumed a fundamentally moral or ethical vi sion of the world. N o such emphasis on morality a nd honor exists in the code of Skull & Bones. On the contrary, the Skull & Bones philo sophy, according to several of its most astute critics and historians, emphasizes the \"double-cross s y stem.\" The \"double-cross\" is s y mbolicall y"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"represented by the crossbones on the emblem of the Order. According to this philosophy, anyone who is not an initiate is inferior, and can be lied to and manipulated to further the p ower of the WASP Establishmen t. To the extent that Ja panese leaders view their American WASP counterparts as men of honor whose word is sacred and whose intentions are presumed to be virtuous, they will miss the fundamental char acter of the American imperium. This is of special importance today, with a leading member of the Skull & Bones system oc cupying the White House. Skull & Bones philosophy first manifested itself at the Amer ican national political level in the late l9th century. At th at time, the men of the Order ad opted all the critical features of the British imperial system, especially the belief in the Anglo Saxon God-given right to rule over all the other ra ces. Even countries like Japa n, which were never colonial p ossessions of the Anglo-American combination, were viewed as inferior na tions to be treated no differently from the colonies in Africa, India or Latin America. In 1898, President William McKinley, one of the last of the Amer ican presidents to manifest any of the ea rly republican (anti-British imperi alism) traditions of the Founding Fathers, was under enormous pressure from the Sku ll & Bones-led American imperialists. Eventually, he went to war ag ainst Spain to \"free\" Cuba and seize the Philippines. This was the first time that th e United States entere d a war through devious manipulation and purely in orde r to expand its territories. It marked the beginning of a new epoch in American history which would fore ver alter the vision of the United States. It was the first evidence that the men of the Order were at th e helm of the ship of state. President McKinley's capitula tion to the WASP warriors wo uld prove to be fatal to himself and, some would say, for his count ry, too. The Spanish-American War of 1898 catapulted the Skull & Bones cr owd into a position of domi nance within the Republican Party. At the 1900 party pres idential nominating convention, McKinley was forced to accept Teddy Roosevelt as hi s vice presidential running mate. The McKinley-Roosevelt slate was swept into office, in part as the result of the jingoi st climate built up by the just- concluded Spanish-American Wa r. Those circumstances were not all that different from the mood that prevails in America in the aftermath of the Gulf War of 1991. Within months of his inauguration of 1901, President McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist while traveling th rough Buffalo, New York. Thus , Teddy Roosevelt became p resident, and the Order of Skul l & Bones for the first time moved into the White House. Roosevelt surrounded himself with Bonesmen. His successo r in 1908, W illiam Howard Taft, was himself a second genera tion member of Skull & Bones. HENRY STIMSON: MASTER BONESMAN Accordin g to a Januar y 1991 article b y the Washin g ton s y ndicated columnists Rowland"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Evans and Robert Novak, when President George Bush was making his final decision to use military force to crush Saddam Hussein and decimate Iraq, he spent most of the Christmas holidays closeted at Camp David reading a newly published biography of one of his true heroes, fellow Skull & Bones in itiate Henry Stimson. While most White House advisers thought that the gulf crisis would be ultimately resolved through diplomacy, unbeknownst to them, President Bush had already de cided on the use of devastating military force -- regardless of what measures the world community or the Iraqi leaders took to avert war. Intimate Bush advisers descri bed the president as being in a \"mesmerized\" state of mind as he walk ed around the presiden tial retreat in the Maryland mountains with his S timson biography, \"The Col onel: The Life and Wars of Henry Stimson,\" under his arm at all times. Indeed, for most contempora ry Bonesmen, Henry Lewis St imson, the quintessential WASP warrior, was the very personification of the Order's full ascent to power during the p eriod of World War II. A member of the Order's class of 1888, Stim son served seven U.S. presidents: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft (a fellow Bonesman), Woodrow Wilson, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Fra nklin Delano Roosevelt an d Harry S Truman. As the Secretary of War under FDR and Truman, Stimson oversa w the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Stimson personally decided on the use of that devastating weapon against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Years earlier, as the chairman of the Amer ican delegation at the Londo n Naval Conference and as Secretary of State under Presi dent Hoover (1929-1 933), Stimson had played a pivotal role in restricting the size of the Japanese Im perial Navy. He would be an architect of the FDR 's administration's economic provocatio ns against Japan which ultimately helped induce Japan into the a ttack at Pearl Harbor, thus bringing the United States formally into World War II. And Stimson was also ultimately responsible for the FDR administration's decision to intern the Nisei (Japan ese-Americans) after Pearl Harbor. Yet, it was also Stimson who or dered American bombers to re frain from attacking the old Japanese imperial capital of Kyoto, a city rich in religious and historical tradition and artifacts. And, according to at least one of Stimson's biographers, it was also \"the Colonel\" who decided at the close of the wa r that the Japanese em peror should not be deposed. His sensitivity to Ja panese culture and the import ance of allowing Japan to retain honor even in de feat is widely to his close advi ser, Joseph Grew , a longtime U.S. ambassador to Japan and an accomplished hist orian. Whether this report of Stimson's involvement in the decision to maintain the emperor is accura te or whether it underplays the role of Gen. Douglas Ma cArthur, the fact remains certa in that Stimson was the key p olicymaker overseeing the postwar oc cupations of both Japan and Germany. To fully understand President George Bush's attitudes and policie s toward Japan, one must first appreciate the ove rarching influence that Stims on had on the current occupant of the White House."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" According to his British biographer Geofrey Hodgson, Stimson's membership in Skull & Bones was \"the most importan t educational experience in his life.\" Unlike most of his fellow Bonesmen, Stimson earned his me mbership solely on the basis of his achievements at Yale -- not through fam ily money. His parents were not wealthy, although his forefathers did come to Americ a as early Puritan co lonists. But Stimson made up for his lack of fina ncial credentials by his fierce competitive spirit. As he himself put it, the \"idea of a st ruggle for prizes, so to speak, has always been one of the fundamental elements of my mi nd, and I can hardly conceive of what my feelings would be if I ever was put in a posi tion or situation in life where there are no prizes to struggle for.\" Although Stimson did not come from classic blueblood ba ckground, he married into wealth and power. His wife, Mabel White, came from a prom inent Establishment family with longstanding ties to th e Order. Thus, upon graduati on from law school, Stimson became a partner in the law firm of Eliahu Root, Pres ident Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary of War. Although Stimson and Roosevel t would have a falling out in later years, early on Roosevelt and Root provided \"the Colonel\" with the critical sponsorship and training required to succeed in the world of Esta blishment politics. According to Stimson's biographers, Roosevelt would frequently taunt the young Bonesman about the fact that he, unlike the president, had ne ver been in the military or f ought in any wars. (Roosevelt had resigned as Under Secretar y of the Navy to go off and fi ght in the Span ish-American War.) Thus, at the ripe old ag e of 44, Stimson jo ined the Army during World War I and served in the American Expe ditionary Forc e in Europe. Among the other lasting interest s that Roosevelt would pass on to Stimson was his deep p assion for the Pacific. Roosevelt was convin ced that America's imperial destiny was dependent upon its dominati on of the Pacific Ocean and the Far East. The Spanish- American War, which marked the beginning of America's imperial phase -- and the virtual abandonment of the re publican principles upon whic h the nation had been founded -- began the U.S. colonial occupation of th e Philippines, which would continue through half of the next century. Ultimately, Stimson would hims elf serve as the American Governor General of the islands. In 1900, Roosevelt wrote to St imson: \"Our people are neit her craven nor weaklings, as we face the future high of he art and confident of soul, eage r to do the great work of a great power... wish to see th e United States the dominant po wer on the Pacific Ocean.\" STIMSON'S KINDERGARTEN AND THE COLD WAR "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Henry Stimson's towering influence on Geor ge Bush and many ot her current members and like-thinking allies of the Order was based not on ly on \"the Colone l's\" lifetime of achievements. It was also rooted in the fact that Stimson used the Wo rld War II period to groom a successor generation of young WASP warriors who would dominate American p olicymaking during the Cold War and beyond. Although no t every member of what came to be known as the \"S timson's Kindergarten\" was a me mber of Skull & Bones, or even a Yale graduate, many were. All were in culcated with the Sk ull & Bones philosophy and methodology of wielding power. It is thr ough this alliance and pa tronage system that the influence of the Order has been extended far beyond its sma ll membership roster. Among the leading members of th e \"Stimson Kindergarten\" were: z John J. McCloy, who was Assistant Secretary of War and later served as the High Commissioner for Germany duri ng the postwar occupation. z Robert Lovett, a member of Skull & Bones and a partner in the Order's preeminent Wall Street investment house Brown Brot hers Harriman. He became Stimson's Assistant Secretary of Wa r (Air Section). Lovett remained an influential policymaker through the presid ency of John F. Kennedy. z Harvey Bundy, another Bonesman, who beca me Stimson's special assistant at the War Department. Harvey Bund y's two sons, McGeorge an d William, fresh out of Yale University and Skull & Bones, joined their father on Stimson's personal staff. McGeorge Bundy would co-author Stimson' s memoirs In Active Service in Peace and War. z Dean Acheson, Assistant Secr etary of State, Yale gradua te (he was not a member of the Order, but, rather, of one of the othe r Yale secret societie s, Scroll Key) and senior policy adviser to FDR and Truman, who ultimately made him Secretary of State. z Gen. George C. Marshall, Chief of Sta ff of the armed forces during World War II and later Truman's Se cretary of State. This group of high-powered policymakers of World War II and immediate post war p eriod were known as the \"Sti mson-Marshall-Acheson Circle .\" They shaped America's Cold War containment policy against the Sovi et Union and Communist China, including the involvement of the United Stat es in the Korean War. It wa s also this gr oup which, for better or worse, directed the postwar reconstruction prog rams in Germany and Japan. Another influential member of Skull & Bones, Averell Harriman, was personally responsible for the sacking of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. It was Harriman, a banker, intriguer and former American Ambassado r to Moscow, who convinced President Truman to fire MacArthur. The predominant role that Averell Harriman wo uld play over the course of 40 years of p ostwar American policymaking underscores the fact that not all leading members of Skull & Bones share the identical polic y outlook. While some me mbers of the Stimson"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"inner circle were critical of Harriman, whom they consid ered to be too personally ambitious (he was also a liber al imperial Democrat in a secret fraternity dominated historically by moderate Repu blicans), Harriman nevertheless stands out as one of the Order's most active figures. The fact that he was a business partner and social intimate throughout his adult life of fe llow Bonesman and Repu blican Sen. Prescott Bush Sr., the father of the current presid ent underscores that point. Henry Stimson died in 1950, leaving behind a core group of political offs pring led by members of his old secret society, Skull & Bo nes. In the final year s of his life he was involved in helping to shape a number of postwar government ag encies which would become bastions of power an d influence for the Order for years to come. Through this active role in shaping the key institutions of the Cold War era, Stimson was able to establish a continuity of powe r that would more than comp ensate for the fact that no single figure among his \"kindergarten\" emer ged as a clear successor, and that several, like McGeorge Bundy, would prove ultimately to be rath er disappointing students. The National Security Act of 1947 transfor med Stimson's old War Department into the Department of Defense, a sprawling civilian bureaucracy which would in future years house many of the most important members of the Orde r. Robert Lovett, for example, would become the Secretary of Defense in 1950. The 1947 act al so established the Central Intelligence Agency (C IA) as the permanent successo r to the wartime Office of Strategic Services (OSS). In the early 1950s , the State Department's Office of Policy Coordination was merged into the CIA, giving the secret agency total control of America's clandestine operations. The Na tional Security Agen cy (NSA) also was established, under the direct ion of the Department of Defense, vastly expanding America's signal inte lligence capability. Of all these agencies of the Cold War era, the CIA would stand out as a singular power center for Yale University al umni in general and Skull & Bones initiates in particular. The term \"spooks,\" the well-k nown CIA term for a clandestin e operator, was originally Yale campus argot for a secret society member. According to a recently published article in the Covert Action Informa tion Bulletin, there is reportedl y a \"Bones club\" within the CIA which helps promote the inte lligence careers of members of the Yale secret society. It should be pointed out that bureaucratic st anding is not a real me asure of power within the CIA. Very often, indivi duals in relatively insignifi cant positions within the organizational chart wield tremendous clout and maintain access to the most sensitive information and policy. Thus, for example, the present U. S. Ambassador to Beijing, James Lilley, a member of S kull & Bones and a career CIA man, is being suggested to replace William Webster as Dire ctor of Central Intelligence. For Lilley to step in as director of CIA would at this moment repres ent a demotion for the senior field operator. It is, however, a demotion he might accept as a personal favor to fellow Bonesman and longtime intimate pal George Bush. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The predominance of Yale gra duates inside the CIA is also a part of the Stimson legacy. During World War II, many Yale students and even several lead ing faculty members entered the OSS. The X-2 Branch of OSS, the counterintellig ence unit, was dominated by Yale students, as well as Ya le English Literature professo r Norman Holmes Pearson. One of the Yale men in X-2, James Jesus Angleton, went on to a legendary career as director of the CIA's counteri ntelligence staff. Yale Skull & Bonesman and S timson \"Kindergartener\" Willi am Bundy assumed a senior p ost at CIA during the 1950s, as did Yale graduates Richard Bisse ll and Cord Meyer and Yale professor Sherman Kent. VIETNAM: THE BONESMEN'S DEBACLE According to author David Ha lberstam's best-se lling critique of the Kennedy years, \"The Best and the Brightest,\" the JFK presidency marked the hi gh point of Skull & Bones p ostwar power. But it also mark ed the beginning of the secret fraternity's fall from the p osition of unchallenged powe r, and the beginning of Americ a's precipitous decline as a world power. All these factors are su mmed up in one word: Vietnam. John Fitzgerald Kennedy's Cabinet was largely handpick ed by Skull & Bones elder statesman Robert Lovett, wh o was personally approached by Joseph Kennedy, the p resident's father, and asked to shape the direction of the new administration. Lovett had been one of the architects of the World War II industrial mobilization under President Franklin Roosevelt, wh ich helped bring the Un ited States out of the Great Depression. He had been a factional opponent of Averell Harriman within the Skull & Bones circles, initially opposing the Cold War containment doctrine a nd pushing the idea of Atoms for Peace during the early years of the Eisenhower presiden cy (l952-1960). Kennedy had personally asked Lo vett to join his Cabinet, but Lovett, a partner in Brown Brothers Harriman, preferred to shun formal government service. Instead, he placed a number of younger Bonesmen into the criti cal posts. McGeorge Bundy was appointed Kennedy's National Security Adviser. Averel l Harriman was made Under Secretary of State for Asian Affairs, a positio n that placed him in charge of many of the most critical decisions along the way to disa ster in Vietnam. William Bund y remained in a senior post at CIA. The decision to escalate the American military involvement in Vietnam -- a rejection of Gen. Douglas MacArthur's prophe tic warning that the United States should never engage in a ground war in Asia -- was made by members of th e Order. According to some accounts, President Kennedy be gan to have serious second th oughts about escalating the war, particularly after seve ral private Oval Office di scussions with MacArthur. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"With Kennedy's assassination, American soldiers began pou ring into Southeast Asia. Harriman remained a fixture of Vietnam polic y under President Lyn don Baines Johnson. McGeorge Bundy remained on as LBJ's National Security Ad viser untill , when he left government service to assume the presidency of the Ford Foundation, the largest tax- exempt philanthropic agency in the United States. Th e Ford Foundation annually dispenses of nearly $3 billion in grants. In his capacity as president of the Ford Foundation, Bundy helped finance the anti- Vietnam War movement. The National Studen t Mobilization Committe e, the umbrella group for the entire New Left of the late 1960s and ea rly 1970s, was led by David Dellinger, a Yale graduate. Episcopal Church ac tivist William Sloan Co ffin, a Bonesman, a second leading figure in the anti-war protest movement, had previously served as a CIA officer. Thus, the Order had its hands in two critical elements of th e policy debacle of the second half of the 1960s. Some le ading Bonesmen helped shap e the disastrous limited war strategy in Vietnam, while othe r members of the Orde r, at least tacitly, contributed to the growth of the drug-rock-sex c ounterculture by nourishing the New Left soil from which it sprang. As a result of the Viet nam debacle, the \"Stimson Kinderga rten\" literally drove itself out of the corridors of power wh ich it had occupied without ch allenge for the previous 20 years. With the election of Richard Nixon as president of the United States in November 1968, a different team came in to prominence. The politics of that team were personified by Henry A. Kissinger, Nix on's National Security Advise r and Secretary of State. In a May 1982 speech in Lo ndon at the Chatham House headquarters of the Royal Institute for International Affairs, Kissinger boasted that he was an enthusiastic follower of the late British Prime Mini ster Winston Churchill, and th at throughout his years in senior government posts under Presidents Nixon and Gerald Ford (1974-1976), he had always consulted more frequently with his counterparts in th e British Foreign Office than he had with officials of his own government. Although Kissinger ha d enjoyed early patronage from McGeorge Bundy, when the Bonesman was Dean of Harv ard University and Kennedy's NSC advise r, the Kissinger era marked a low point in Sk ull & Bones' government powe r. The Central Intelligence Agency, a hub of the Order's clout, was deci mated by scandals that only compounded the damage done to the Agency as the result of its role in the Vietnam disaster. According to some respected writers, for example, Jim Hougan, author of \"Secret Agenda,\" the CIA attempted to reverse the r oute by helping to bring down Richard Nixon in Watergate. There is significant evid ence to bolster some of these accounts. When Gerald Ford be came president in Au g ust 1974 followin g Nixon's resi g nation, Skull"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"& Bones made a brief comeback . In what came to be kn own as the \"Saturday Night Massacre,\" Ford, in the autumn of 1975, re moved Henry Kissinger from his post as NSC Adviser, replacing him with Ge n. Brent Scowcroft. Kissinger ally James Schlesinger was fired as Secretary of Defense and replaced by Donald Rumsfeld. And CIA Director William Colby, who had dueled with Angleton, was fired and replaced by Skull & Bones member George Bush. If these maneuvers were intend ed to be the first step in a more ambitious comeback by the WASP warrior faction, th e plan was short-circuited wi th the election in November 1976 of Jimmy Carter as president. It wo uld really not be until the inauguration of George Bush as president in January 1989 -- a dozen years later -- that Skull & Bones would resurface with the same degree of governmental po wer that it had enjoyed during the Stimson years. George Bush 's selection as Ronald Reaga n's vice presidential running mate in the 1980 and 19 84 elections was the trans ition back to that power. Many things had gone wrong in the years si nce Vietnam to drive the Bonesmen off the center stage. With more th an a little input fr om Bonesmen like McGeorge Bundy and Averell Harriman, the United States had gone into a period of scie ntific, technological and industrial retreat. The Nixon decision on August 15, 1971 to remove the dollar from a fixed, gold-backed exchange rate system, had triggered a move toward double-digit inflation, urban decay, risi ng unemployment and soaring inte rest rates. The Kissinger- orchestrated Iranian-Middle East oil crisis in the early 1970s had cont ributed to a rate of deindustrialization that ultimately transformed the United State from the biggest creditor nation in the world to the world's biggest de btor nation. According to estimates compiled around the time of George Bu sh's inauguration as presiden t, the total U. S. internal indebtedness had skyr ocketed to more than $12 trillion. Moreover, the period of the 1970s and 1980s had given ri se to a new and powerful p olitical-financial combination demanding a share of government clout. This new grouping, with its principle po wer bases in the U. S. Congress, in Ho llywood and on Wall Street, was known as the Zionist lobby. Although Jewish names had been prominent in the legal prof ession and on Wall Street since the founding of the Am erican republic, in the afterm ath of the 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and her Arab neighbors, Zionist power took on a whole different p roportion. Again, Henry Kissinger's position in the Nixon administ ration symbolized the fact that the pro-Israel lob by had moved in with a vengeance to the corridors of power in the nation's capital. Even on Wall Street the 1970s and 1980 s had seen a new generation of Jewish financiers come into power, replacing their mo re cultured and Anglicized p redecessors. The WASP Establishment had developed a tolerance of and working relationship with the largely German Jewish bankers known among themselves as \"Our Crowd.\" The new upstart Wall Street Zionists, however, were viewed by the WASPs as a collection of gangsters. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"If the Skull & Bonesmen needed a legitimate justification fo r reviving their ever-present dislike of the East Europe an Ashkenazic Jews, the Wall Street Zionists who became known as the so-called \"New Crowd\" provided them with all the excuses necessary. When Jonathan Jay Pollard, a Naval intelligence analyst, wa s arrested in November 1985 and charged with spying for Is rael against the United States , there was a resurgence of more unabashed antisemitis m among the Bonesmen and their blueblood upperclass mates. It has since become a hallmark of the Bush White House. Even when practical p olitical affairs have demand ed that the Bush administra tion deal with the American Zionist lobby or the right-wing Shamir government of Israel , there has been a distinctive undertone of distrust bor dering on overt hostility. BUSH IN PROFILE Unlike Averell Harriman, w ho reportedly coveted personal political power and drew sharp criticism from some of his fellow Bo nesmen, George Bush has been a long-term \"project\" of Skull & Bones. The Bush presiden cy in real and symbo lic terms represents the effort by the Order to restore the lost spirit of the WASP wa rrior Henry Stimson. With the passage of time and the decay of the WASP elite, the Bush presidency may yet p rove to be a tragic replay of past American dreams. George Bush's career was sp onsored every step of the wa y by Skull & Bones members, mostly of his father's generation. Prescott Bush (Skull & Bones Cl ass of 1917), a Brown Brothers Harriman partner who would serv e one term in Congress as senator from Connecticut, sent George to the traditional private preparat ory school, Phillips Academy in Andover, New Hampshire, which grooms young New Engla nd squires for later studies at Yale. It was while finishing his prep school training at Andover th at Bush was first exposed to Henry Stimson. Reportedly, Stim son delivered a stirring patr iotic speech to the Phillips student body in l940 arguing fo rcefully for American interv ention in the war in Europe. Ironically, at that very mome nt on the Yale campus, the ma jority of Skull & Bonesmen were leading the America Firs t movement, which opposed any such U.S. entanglement in Europe. When war with Japan broke out a year later, George Bush enliste d in the Navy and was trained as a pilot. He flew mo re than 50 missions before bein g shot down in the Pacific. At Yale after the war, Bush captained the baseball team and followed his father's footsteps into the Order. Political legends have it that George Bush shunned his family's pa tronage and went off on his own to launch a business career as an oil wildcatter , or speculator, in Texas. N othin g could be farther from the truth. Bush moved to Te xas to work for Dresser"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Industries selling oil drilling equipment. The job was arra nged for him by his father with Dresser president Neil Mallon, who was a fellow member of Skull & Bones. Desser, according to several sources, had close ties w ith the CIA. After a few years with Dresser, George Bush set up his ow n company, Zapata Oil, to explore new oil fields in Texa s and Mexico. Again, Bush wa s heavily backed by member of his family. Uncle George Herbert Walker , also a Skull & Bonesman, put up a large amount of capital, as did Br own Brothers Harriman. Lazard Brothers, a Jewish brokerage house with longstanding frie ndly ties to the New England WASPs, put up some money as well, at the urging of Andr e Meyer, the owner of the Wa shington Post Corporation and the father of the current Po st publisher Kathanne Graham . Zapata Oil sunk the first offshore well for the Kuwaiti government. Even with that kind of backing, George Bu sh was less than a success as a businessman. In 1964, a longtime Bush friend , William Farrish III of Scotla nd, bought the majority of shares in Zapata for $3.2 mil lion to keep the business aflo at, while George, in a major career shift, ran for U.S. Congress from a wea lthy district in Houston, Texas. He won. During his three terms in Congr ess (Bush lost the 1970 Sena te race to Lloyd Bentsen), George Bush distinguished himself as an advocate of zero population growth and a defender of the eugenics move ment. Both of these positions, radical for their day, were p robably the result of Bush's close friendship with Willi am Draper Jr. -- a fellow Bonesman and a longtime advocate of popula tion reduction schemes in the Third World. The 1970s were for George Bu sh years of grooming in hi gh-level politics and foreign p olicy. During the Nixon re-ele ction campaign of 1 972, George Bush was the chairman of the Republican National Co mmittee. He later joined th e chorus calling for Nixon's resignation. After a tour as th e U.S. Ambassador to the Un ited Nations, Bush was sent of f to Communist China as the Chief Liaison Officer prior to the formalization of diplomatic relations. Bush shared the Be ijing experience with Winston Lord, a fellow Skull & Bones member who was the CIA station chief. Lord went on to become president of the New York Council on Foreig n Relations (CFR) in 1983. (The Lo rd family founded the city of Hartford, Connecticut, has a la rge number of Skull & Bones members on its family tree, and set up one of the most powe rful old-line Wall Street law firms, Lord Day Lord.) In 1975, George Bush completed his \"grooming\" with a brief stint as Gerald Ford's CIA director. In 1980, Bush ran a short-lived campaign ag ainst Ronald Reagan for the Republican Party's presidential nominatio n. Future running mate Re agan cut short Bush's 1980 p residential hopes by defeating him soundly in the primary election in New Hampshire, in the heart of New Englan d. Reagan blasted Bush fo r his membership in the internationalist Trilateral Co mmission, which had attained notoriety because 20 members of the unpopular Carter administration had served on the commis sion.

THE ORDER'S NETWORK With Bush in the White House, the WASP Es tablishment is seeki ng to re-conquer lost territory, not only within the domain of national politics, but within the financial community, the legal profession and big busine ss. A struggle between some elements of the WASP crowd and the Jewish \"New Crowd\" on Wall Street has been playing out in the newspapers and federal cour ts for the past six years, beginning with the criminal indictments of junk bond dealers Ivan Bo esky and Michael Milken and the bankrupting and criminal prosecuting of the powerful Zionist- run brokerage hous e Drexel Rurnham Lambert. To some extent these wars reflect the kind of scramble that always takes place during a financial crisis and shakeout, when certain formerly powerful financ ial institutions are wiped out and others profit fro m their rivals' adversity. Duri ng the Great Depression of the 1930s, the House of Morgan came out on top. Not coinci dentally, Morgan Guaranty Trust and Morgan Stanley have been corn erstones of the Skull & Bones grouping on Wall Street since their founding during the last century. F ounding partner Harold Stanley was a Bonesman. One hub of the Order's postwar econom ic power, the major multinational oil corporations, have clearly benefited great ly from President Bush 's \"charming little colonial war\" in the Persia n Gulf. The leading oil compan ies which are linked to the Order are: Standard Oil Trust Corporation, Shell Oil of Americ a, Creole Petroleum Corporation and Pennzoil Corpor ation. The founder and presen t chairman of the board of Pennzoil started out in the oil bus iness in partnership with Geor ge Bush in Zapata Oil. It is interesting to note in th e context of the Bonesmen's de ep involvement in the world p etroleum business that George Bush, during his early da ys as a Texas oilman, had worked closely with the Kuwaitis. Eight major Wall Street and Wa shington, D.C. law firms stan d out as practically wholly- owned subsidiaries of the Or der of Skull & Bones. Each of these firms was founded by members of the Order, and each of these fi rms continues to provide up-and-coming Order initiates in the legal community with training, credentials and connections. A review of the major corporate clients of these firms would reveal many of the most powerful companies among th e Fortune 500.

In addition to their corporate clientele an d their direct involve ment in government through the frequent appointment of partners to Cabinet posts, these firms also specialize in handling the personal fina ncial affairs and investment portfolios of the leading WASP families. In this respect, th e Skull & Bones-centered WASP Establishment imitates the Venetian model. During the height of power of Venice, which was th e trading capital of the Byzantine Empire, the le ading families used their pe rsonal wealth to establish insurance companies, family funds and cultural programs th rough which they extended their political power. Today, the prominent law firms listed above play a special role in directing the affairs of the leading tax-exempt founda tions which shape the culture and public opinion of the United States and many forei gn countries. We have already se en that McGeorge Bundy, a leading Bonesman, left his position as Nati onal Security Adviser to President Lyndon Johnson in 1966 to assume the presidency of the Ford Foundation. During the nearly two decades that Bundy spent directing the $3 bil lion tax-exempt fund, he arguably wielded more power than he did duri ng his six years as the Natio nal Security Adviser to two p residents. Under the Bundy re ign the Ford Foundation spen t hundreds of millions of dollars to launch the e nvironmentalist movement and funded scores of projects devoted to p opulation reduction in the Third World. From its early decades, the Or der has concentrated much of its efforts at establishing, controlling and, in some in stances, capturing the majo r tax-exempt philanthropic foundations of America. Th e Russell Sage Foundation, wh ich specializes in \"social control\" programs, was founded by Bonesm en. Among the leadi ng functions of the Russell Sage Foundation today is the maintaining of a centraliz ed tracking of the finances of all the large tax-exempt f oundations in the United States . The Peabody Foundation, the Slater Foundation and several of the Rockefeller foundations were all either started by members of the Order or have been dominated by Bonesmen from their inception. Other major family funds, like th e Ford Foundation and the Ca rnegie Endowment, were wrestled from family control by the Skull & Bones apparatu s. During the tenure of McGeorge Bundy, two members of the Ford family resigned from the Ford Foundation in disgust over the direction in which Bundy had taken the philanthropic agency. THE NEW WORLD ORDER "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" Between 1983-1986, the British-bo rn conspiracy theo rist Antony Sutton wrote a series of p amphlets about the Order of S kull & Bones. According to in formed sources, Sutton was one of several historians who were provided with a large fi le of the Order's internal documents, including minutes of some meetings , descriptions of ritu als, and what would appear to be a rather complete list of its members from its founding throu gh to the early 1980s. The short pamphlets were compiled into one volume and published as a book in 1986. For someone closely following the just-concl uded Persian Gulf Wa r and attempting to gain some insight into George Bush's performance du ring that largely or chestrated affair, one recurring theme in the Su tton volume stands out like a sore thumb: the New World Order. According to the Skull & Bo nes documents used by Sutton in his somewhat flawed p rofile of the Order, the creation of a New World Or der is a primary goal of the Bonesmen and has been for deca des. For the initiates into th e Order, the term New World Order has a very specific meaning. It is a world dominated by American milita ry power and American control over all strategic raw materials. Just as the Greek city-state of Spar ta provided the Skull & Bones with the image of a WASP wa rrior caste, the Persian Em pire, with its system of coalitions of satrap armies, provides the model for the Bonesmen's New World Order. The image of Secretary of State James A. Ba ker III traveling from foreign capital to foreign capital demanding military legions or chests of go ld to finance the war for a New World Order is an image st raight out of the chronicl es of the Pe rsian Empire. According to the recent biog raphy of Henry Stimson, the man who inspired President Bush was firmly convinced th at it was essential for Americ a to go to war once every generation or so. It wa s, for Stimson, a spiritually cl eansing process which enables the nation to rally behind a cause and overcom e its weaknesses and s hortcomings in one grand burst of military fervor. The romantic mystique of th e purgative powers of combat is key to understanding the politic al philosophy of Skull & Bones. Although America's Vietnam deba cle remains a bitter memory of the Bonesmen's failure in war, the recent Persian Gu lf conflict, with its massive overkill and the use of highly advanced weapons and techno logies, is now the new glor ious symbol of the WASP warrior caste's reincarnation. When President Bush vowed that the Gulf War would not be another Vietnam, he was speaking first and foremost to his fellow Bonesmen -- not to the American people. If such thinking smacks of dangerous fant asy on the part of a major world power in the mode rn era, it is indeed. On a more practical political level, the Gulf War was a gambit to save the Bush p residenc y from a mountin g pile of domestic financial wo es, not the leas t of which was"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"the savings and loan (S&L) crisis and a pend ing series of failures of major commercial banks. In the months preced ing the Gulf showdown, the pr esident's own son, Neil Bush, came under intense media scrutin y for his role in the failure of a large S&L in Colorado. N eil's photograph, testifying under oath before a congress ional committee probing fraud among top S & L managers, became a familiar front-page feature in every major newspaper in America, thre atening dangerous popular disillusion with the Yale Bonesman in the White House. With a U.S. federal govern ment deficit projected at nearly a half a trillion dollars for Fiscal Year 1991, in large part be cause of the S&L crisis and a shrinking business tax base, the Democratic Party majority in th e U.S. Congress was p ressing for deep cutbacks in defense spending now that the Cold War had ended. On the international stage, th e reunification of Germany, cl early the most dramatic event of 1990, posed new challenges to the Bush team. Germany was about to emerge as the dominant power in continental Europe by virtue of its adva nced industrial infrastructure and its long tradition of inde pendent political dealings with Moscow. Just months before the outbreak of the Gulf cris is, Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl had met with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and signed a long term economic assistance pact. As a result, Gorbachev dropped all remaining objections to the immediate reunification of Germany. At that point, the Bush administ ration changed its tactics. Previ ously, in sharp contrast to the Thatcher government in Great Britain, it had been nominally in favor of German reunification. But at the Ho uston economic summit of the Group of Se ven Industrialized Countries in the summer of 1990, the United States blocked (with Britain) Germany's p lan of unconditional economic ai d to the Soviet Un ion. President Bush took the position that the Soviet Union must submit to International Moneta ry Fund requisites as a p recondition for any substan tive economic assistance. In the Far East, Japan's con tinuing growth in manufactur ing also posed a threat to Washington's desire to retain superpower status. If Presi dent Bush and his Bonesmen coterie were unaware of a st unning historical analogy, thei r British \"cousins\" were quick to pick up on the parallels between the global strategic situation in July 1990 and the identical international situation that existed 100 years earlier. In the 1890s, France, under th e brilliant political leadership of Foreign Mini ster Gabriel Hanataux, was attempting to forge a Eurasian alliance w ith Germany, Russia and Meiji Japan. The idea was to link co ntinental Europe with Japan an d China through a series of large overland infrastructure projects, beginning with the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Through treaties covering key ar eas of economic and security matters, Hanataux hoped to create a zone of prosperity, built on a foundation of rapid ec onomic growth and extensive trade. Such a political-economic common interest alliance threatened the imperial hegemony of Great Britain. At the tu rn of the 20th centur y , Britain looked to th e United States (as its"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"English-speaking ally) to jo in in sabotaging the Hanata ux plan. Through the Spanish- American War of 1898 and the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 , Britain and her American j unior partner (by then led by Henry Stimson's old mentor Te ddy Roosevelt) managed to disrupt the French-German-Ru ssian-Japanese economic axis . Two world wars and the Great Depression were the conseq uences of that interference. THE PERSIAN GULF WAR It was against this historical backdrop th at President Bush, invoking the World War II imagery of his Skull & Bones idol Henry Stimson, went to war against Iraq. There is even speculation that Presid ent Bush was personally inst rumental in luring Saddam Hussein into invading Kuwait, thereby provoking the Amer ican-led military response. Many news accounts have emphasized that a two-hour private meeting between the p resident and Margaret Thatcher in the As pen, Colorado vacation chalet of U.S. Ambassador Henry Catto on August 2, 1 990 helped finalize Bush's decision to immediately deploy military force. Recently, an astute Japanese analyst drew a disturbing para llel between Bush and FDR, who was greatly influenced by Stimson. Acco rding to the writer, FDR lured Japan into World War II through an intri cate series of economic warfare maneuvers which left Japan with little choi ce but to strike-back. In much the sa me way, said the analyst, Bush had lured Saddam Hussein into Kuwait in order to launch a new Gulf War that would have consequences reaching far beyo nd Iraq and the Middle East. As a result of the military vict ory over Iraq, the United St ates is in the process of establishing a string of perm anent military bases throughou t the Persian Gulf and Near East. The oil sheikdoms of the region, led by Saudi Arabia , are now thoroughly dependent on the American milita ry presence to ensure the su rvival of their regimes. The Organization of Petroleum Ex porting Countries (OPEC) is effectively captured by Washington. American bankers aided by U.S. gunboats now are setti ng world oil prices. Thus, one consequence of the Pe rsian Gulf War is that the United States now has an oil weapon -- pointed principally at Germany and Japan. Ironically, America's two chief economic rivals have paid out a total of $2 7 billion to date to help finance a Bush administration military advent ure which put the oil weapon in Washington's hand. Another telling example of how th e Order's man in the Oval Office intends to administer a crumbling U.S. domestic econo my while imposing the New World Order on the rest of the world is to be found in th e recent buyout of the majori ty of stock in Citicorp, the largest U.S. commercial bank, by Saudi Prince Talal bin Abdul Aziz . Citicorp is one of the major American commercial banks on the verge of collaps e, but which is considered by the Bush administration and the Federal Re serve System to be \"t oo big to fall.\" The stock p urchase amounted to a Saudi Ro y al Famil y bail-out of Citicor p , usin g the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"increased profits being enjoyed by the House of Saud as a re sult of the massive jump in Saudi oil production since the beginning of the Gulf crisis in August 1990. There points up a striking di fference between the role of th e United States in World War II and the Bush administration's handling to da te of the Middle East crisis. During World War II, the United States we nt through a genuine economic revival. Skull & Bones historian Samuel Huntington de scribed it as a \"neo Hamilto nian\" policy, a reference to the first United States Secretar y of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. Beginning in 1939, America became a major supplie r of military and industrial goods under the Lend-Lease p rogram to the European states fighting Hitler. At the same time, the federal government began issuing low-interest cr edits to revive the nation's manufacturing base which had been gutted by a decade of economic depression. The indust rial buildup accelerated once the United States formally ente red .World War II, leading to the establishing of entirely new industrial sectors, such as aerospace and petrochemicals. This time around -- at least to date -- there has been no such marsha ling of the U.S. domestic industrial base. Desp ite moderate increases in th e production of certain high- tech weapons systems, the U.S. economy continues its gradual slide into what could be a new depression. Unemployment is greater than at any poin t in the last decade. Some sociologists fear that the complete disi ntegration of America's urban centers could p roduce new race-riots as early as the summer of 1991. The single greatest challenge to George Bush and the Order is: Can they capitalize on the current revival of the American spirit to reverse the disast rous post-industrial society dogmas, and launch th eir own version of the World War II neo-Hamiltonian industrial recovery? So far, some doom sayers claim, it appears that Bush and his administration p lan instead to direct their ef forts at looting and blackmailin g the rest of the world -- especially the gulf oil sheikd oms, Japan and Germany -- in to bailing out the bankrupt U.S. financial houses and fede ral government and financing th e posting of American-led foreign legions at every corner of the globe where there are la rge deposits of strategic raw materials. If this policy is not altered, George Bush may soon find himself presiding over a new disaster that will make the Vietnam debacle appear insignificant in comparison. The politics of the New World Or der appear to be borrowed la rgely from the pages of the decline and fall of the Britis h Empire. Political columnist Patrick Buchanan, an early vocal opponent of the Bush Pers ian Gulf strategy, warned as early as August 1990 that the White House was falling into the trap of British \"balance of power\" po litics, the very p olitics that left Great Britain on the scrap he ap of world powers at the close of World War II, and put Winston Church ill, the architect of World Wa r II and the Cold War, out of a job. Since the crushing military defe at of Iraq by a te chnologically far supe rior American-led coalition, the Bush administratio n has vacillated on a postwar policy for the region. It has p ursued a pra g matic power balancin g g ame which is rife with potential problems. The"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"two key elements of the American balanc e-of-power politics in the region are the p reservation of a weakened but territorially whole Iraq to offset the other woul d -be regional-powers Iran and Syria. At the same time, it is til ting toward a nominally more \"pro-Arab\" position with regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict. While the harsh reparations terms being imposed upon a war-dev astated Iraq are p robably, in the mind of Bush, aimed at di ssuading any future re gional military power from launching-cross-border aggressions, they amount to th e slow, excruciating extermination of the population of that country. As one seas oned observer noted recently, earlier air wars had caused gr eater immediate losses of life, due to the inaccuracy of bombs and rockets, but had generally left basic infrastructures intact. The precision bombing of Iraq's entire infrast ructure has caused what a Unit ed Nations team has called an \"apocalypse.\" The greater lo ss of life will occur in the af termath of the combat as a country with 16 million inhabita nts is suddenly thrown into a \"pre-industrial\" state with no electricity, no water or other necessities. American human itarian aid, administered by occupying troops, will not offset this apocalypse -- especially if harsh war reparations and asset seizures deprive Iraq of the financial re sources needed to begi n a rebuilding process. Regardless of the fact that th e United States has not thrown the full we ight of its military p resence behind the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime , the shortsightedness of the p resent Bush policy may very we ll lead to a Lebanon-type pr otracted civil war in Iraq. Such a war could potentially sp read throughout the region. IMPLICATIONS FOR JAPAN Throughout this short study of the Order of Skull & Bones, emphasis has been placed on the philosophy, the r ituals and the modus operandi of the Bonesmen w ho have devoted their post-Yale careers to worl d politics. This particular empha sis was chosen in order to p rovide the Japanese reader w ith an insight into how the Bu sh presidency views the rest of the world, so that it will be possible for Japan to better understand what it faces in the p os t -Persian Gulf War st rategic environment. The implications of Skull & Bones domination over Ameri can policymaki ng under the Bush presidency are enormous. Japan must be prepared to meet what amounts to a fundamentally new challenge. Few of the post war experiences in U.S. Japanese relations will have prepared the Japa nese government and the leader s of Japanese industry and finance for-what they now face. In the recent past, the policy of Washington toward Japan has been simply to use political leverage, mostly related to Ja pan's regional security concer ns, to exact compromises and concessions in the economic and financial sphere. But the United States, under its policy of free trade, p rivatization of the monetar y and credit mechanisms, and the transition to"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"p os t -industrial service-oriented forms of ec onomic activity at home, has suffered a gradual but steady decline over the past 20 to 30 years. Ja pan, meanwhile, has prospered under a more protectionist a nd industry oriented policy. In the past decade, Japan has be en increasingly thrust into the role of s capegoat for the decline of American prosper ity, while at the same time co ming under mount ing pressure to help finance the United States out of its economic mess. The pr essures upon Japan to b ail out its postwar big brother have caused tensions between Washington and Tokyo, but the Cold War had provided a common secur ity interest that generally offset the occasional rough language. Under the George Bush Skull & Bones regime at the White House all that has changed. True to the Bonesmen's credo of constructive chaos and gl obal political domination by the WASP Establishment, the United States is now out to dominate U.S.-Japanese relations with a degree of br utal frankness that will fly in the face of all previous American sensitivities to Japan's honor. Gone are the da ys of former U.S. Ambassador Michael Mansfield, who always sought to maintain a public climate of friendship and cooperation between the two nations even wh en behind the scenes he was taking the toughest of stands on th e most divisive issues. Under the American-led New World Order, Japa n can expect to be treated with far less respect publicly. It ca n expect that the Bush administ ration, including his coterie of former top CIA men now worki ng directly out of the Oval Office, will be constantly interfering, covertly in the internal affairs of Nippon. This shift in style has held sway since the Bush inauguration and the subsequent appointment of Michael Armacost as U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo. Armacost has assumed the posture of a Roman pro-consul, dictating policy to a weak satr ap, rather than to engage, in diplomatic dialogue. Armacost's pe rformance even before the recent events in the Persian Gulf reestablished American military might as th e defining factor in world affairs -- should have pr ovided the Japanese le adership with a clue as to the shift under way in Washington's new policy approach. The Bush policy can best be described as a sophisticated containment policy. The new approach to Pacific affairs wa s telegraphed in the early days of the Bush administration when the president deployed thre e of his most trusted senior spooks to three critical Asian diplomatic posts: Armaco st was sent to Tokyo; Bush's vi ce presidential national security aide and former career CIA operator Donald Gregg was sent to Seoul; and John Lilly, another career CIA man and a fellow Yale Skull & Bones me mber, was sent to Beijing. The fact that three of the CIA's most experienced cl andestine field operators were assigned the senior diplomatic posts says a great deal ab out the Bush administration's intentions to conduct sophisticated political -warfare and sow conf usion among the three major nations of the Far East. Bush clearly intends to pursue the historic Skull & Bones mission of extendin g America's dominion ov er the entire Pacific re g ion. The idea of even"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"p aying lip service to equal partnership between Washingt on and Tokyo is over, at least for the time being. The process of internally we akening Japan's resistance to this overarching domination by Washington's New World Order began with the Recruit scandal, when the Takeshita government was brought down through a U.S.-inspired secret intelligence operation. One of the primary targets of th at operation was Yashuhiro Nakasone, the former prime minister and the architect of Japan's post-1973 effo rt to develop independent ties to the oil-producing Arab states of the Persian Gulf. It is important to understand that Bush 's WASP warriors, while adopting a similar approach of non-compromise an d domination over Israel and the Zionist lobby inside the United States, will not hesitate to use the Jewish lobby as an instrument for bashing Japan into line. Thus, Commerce Secr etary Robert Mosbacher went out of his way to encourage the Anti-Defamation League's leadership conv ention, which he addr essed last year, to j oin with the Bush administrati on in pressuring Japan to subm it to American free trade demands. The Bush administration will at times encourage the Zion ist lobby and Israel to mercilessly attack Japa n and will at other times severely criticize Zionist \"insensitivity\" to Tokyo. This will all be part of the Bush strategy to dominate the Pacific Rim by p laying one country or faction off against an other, using hard cop-soft cop and other classic techniques of the intelligence trade. Japan will be offered a limited junior part ner status in the New World Order, while coming under mounting pressure to continue providing trib ute to finance the American imperium. Above all else, Ja pan will be forbidden from de veloping any independent foreign policy toward its neig hbors, the Soviet Union, the Arab world or anyone else. Such programs as the Global Infrastructure Fund, to the extent that they pose an alternative to the U.S.-dominated in ternational regime, will be vetoed. As a subservient junior partner in the New World Order arrangemen t, Japan's financial and economic muscle will be used as the piggy-bank for U.S. imperial objectives. The $14 billion \"contribution\" to th e U.S.-led Gulf-War coaliti on was another benchmark in the transition in U.S.-Japanese relations, as was President Bu sh's abrupt cancellation of his long-sheduled state visit to Tokyo. When the chairman of th e Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) attempted to visi t Kuwait immediately after the gulf cease-fire in March l991, the U.S. State Department refused to grant him permission to go into the American- occupied territory. These inte ntional diplomatic affronts s hould be unders tood as telling signs of the new American -Japanese relationship. On the other-hand, President Bu sh also suddenly scheduled a brief summit with Japanese Prime Minister Kaifu in Newport Beach, Cali fornia for April 4, 1 991. One purpose of the sudden meetin g was to la y out clear parameters of acceptabl e behavior on th e part of the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Japanese government wh en the prime minister meets later in April with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Japanese Soviet relations, like all ot her crucial Japanese foreign relations, will be expected to co nform with those of the U.S. An essential blackmail \"s tick\" that the Bush administrati on intends to hold over Tokyo is- Japanese dependency on Persian Gulf oil. As-the result of the Gulf War and the post war American military occupation of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia an d other-key oil-producing sheikdoms, the Bush administration will exert unabashed control over world oil supplies - - and prices. In the New Worl d Order, Japan's oil supply w ill be increasingly linked to concessions on a range of monetary and economic issu es, including the Global Agreements on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) talks, which broke up last year as the result of largely Japanese and continenta l European resistance to the pure free-trade system sought by Bush and Thatcher. Assist ant Treasury Secretary David Mulford, a former senior official at White Weld Securi ties, Inc., which restructured Saudi Arabia's entire financial apparatus, has recently announced that he will seek to prosecute Japan for its violations of the GATT regulations that call upon Tokyo to surrender govern ment control over interest rate policies to the international banking community. The Bush presidency, with its ambitious dr ive for domination over former friends and foes alike, poses an unprecede nted challenge to Japan. While this is neither the time nor the place to offer a solution to the growing dilemma, the profile of the men of Skull & Bones in this white paper shoul d provide the Japanese reader with helpful insights into the nature of the American WA SP warrior class and the secr et society which spawned it.
