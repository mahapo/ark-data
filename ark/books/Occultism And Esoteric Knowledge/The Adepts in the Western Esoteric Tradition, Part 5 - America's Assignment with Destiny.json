The rapid advancement in the social and political states of man, the increasing rich- ness of human living, and the broadening vision toward individual and collective responsibility herald, with auroral colors, the rising sun of truth. There is much yet to be accomplished, but already the achievement is impressive. Even the most devout humanist cannot survey the orderly progress of the race and at the same time deny the existence of a well-integrated program. The light of the ancient Vedas is slowly but surely illuminating the whole world. The vision of man's noble destiny and the sacred sciences which made possible the realization of that vision have been guarded and served by \"the Silent Ones of the earth.\" The priesthoods of the sacerdotal colleges, the hierophants of the Mystery Schools, and the adept-masters of the Secret Societies have been the guardians of man's noblest purpose-the perfection of his own kind. It is the inalienable right of every honorable person to be grateful for the opportunities which progress bestows. With this appreciation comes also an appropriate measure of resolution. The past proves the future, which is but the extension of good works toward their fullness. The Mystery Schools neither restrained nor limited the unfoldment of human institutions.

This process must continue, for growth is not hastened by the interference of authority. Man substan- tiates with his mind and heart that which he fashions with his hands. The esoteric tradition ensouls \"the ordinary works,\" revealing the larger purposes through the smaller ones. Not so long ago, ninety per cent of the population of the earth was in physical slavery. Having liberated his body, the audacious creature must now free his heart and mind. Thus, pressed on by a sovereign necessity, the world conqueror becomes the self-conqueror. Under a democratic concept of living, the responsibilities for progress pass to the keeping of the people. The powers vested in the governing body functioning with the consent of the governed include not only provisions for collective security, but also the advancement of such religions, philosophies, arts and sciences as contribute to the essential growth of human character. An administrative system which ignores ethics, culture, and morality cannot survive as a dominant political organism. Democratic institutions must accept the task for which they were fashioned and become the conscious custodians of the democratic destiny. Progress demands the most from those with the largest spheres of influence. Vast organizations, industrial. polit- ical, social, and educational, have been made possible by the modern life-way. These have become the molders of public opinion, feared or respected according to the meas- ure of integrity revealed in their management. The future of human society is intimately associated with the destinies of these vast enterprises which have inherited, along with physical success, the duty or, more correctly, the privilege of world guardianship. Even the continuance of the eco- nomic theory now demands the strengthening of ethical convictions. Prominence of any kind, whether bestowed by wealth or authority, carries with it priestly obligations."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AMERICAJS ASSIGNMENT \"V1TH DESTINY 7 The leader, whatever be his fleld, is looked upon for intelligent guidance. His convictions inspire his followers, his words influence their lives, and his policies dominate their activities. There is every indication that the esoteric tradition will next function through that complex of vast interrelated organisms of production and distribution which now dom- inates human imagination. While this structure may appear to the superficial-minded as heartless and soulless, it is also the largest and most powerful potential instru- ment for the advancement of mankind ever yet devised. Education, science, and economics are today indivisible. They have already formed a partnership for their mutual advancement. Equipped with knowledge, skill, and the necessary physical resources, this huge combine awaits the destiny for which it was intended. There is no virtue in burdening the future with the conclusions of today. To prophecy is to restrict, not the will of heaven, but the mind of man. Old principles, as they reveal more of themselves, will be given new names; and progress is always an adjustment of concepts, each of which is in a constant state of change. Assuming, however, that the term democracy, with its numerous imponderable overtones, conveys a conviction of natural unfoldment, it is reasonable to infer that the democratic motion will con- tinue until all of its potentials have become potencies. Progress is not bound inevitably to any nation or people. Social and political structures are instruments for the advancement of the Great Work only to the degree that they keep the faith. If ambition or selfishness breaks the bond, the privilege of guardianship is forfeited.

Although empires may collapse, great teachers be mar- tyred, schools and systems perish, and enlightened leaders remain unhonored, the substance of the Great Work re- mains unchanged and unchangeable. New vehicles appear, even as the older ones are betrayed by human selfishness.

All things created by men are mortal and destructible, but the way destined by heaven is immortal and indestructible.

All three came from a remote region lying eastward, introduced arts and sciences, and founded religious cults or Mysteries. From the legendary histories of these persons, they should be in- cluded as adepts or initiates of ancient Secret Schools, possibly Atlantean. In a book written in the Quichean language and attrib- uted to Votan, the great one declared himself \"a snake,\" a descendent of Imos of the line of Chan. He came to America, by the command of God, from a distant place. He ultimately founded Palanque, and built a temple with many subterranean chambers, which was called the House of Darkness.

Itzamna was sometimes called \"the Skillful Hand.\" After his death, his body was divided. His skillful hand was placed in one temple, his heart in another, and the rest of his remains in a third. One of the best known of his emblems was a Tau or T cross.* It is now generally admitted that the Quetza1coatl of the Nahuatlan people, the Gucumatz of the Quiches, and the Kulkulkan of the more southern Mayas were one person. In each language, the word signifies feathered, plumed, or winged serpent. This title may have resulted from Quetza1coatl casting his lot among, or gathering his first followers from, the descendants of Votan. This tribal group had the serpent as its heraldic device. At a remote time this semimystical, semidivine priest-initiate Quetzal- coati came from the fabled land of the \"seven colors\" and established his rite at Tulla and Cholula. Quetzalcoatl was the initiate-philosopher and teacher of the Nahuatlan tribes of Central Mexico. Among the appela- tions of this priest-prophet-king are \"he who was born of the virgin,\" \"Lord of the 'Winds,\" and \"the Divince Incar- nation.\" Quetzalcoatl was the son of the universal creator- god and the virgin Sochiquetzal, and his conception was made known by an ambassador from the god of the Milky Way. Torquemada, in his Indian L11 anarchies, described a hand of people who came from the north dressed in long black robes.

Mendieta, in his Ecclesiastical History, de- scribed Quetzalcoatl as a white man with a strong forma- tion of body, broad forehead, large eyes, and a flowing beard. He wore a mitre on his head, and was dressed in a long white robe reaching to his feet, and covered with a design of red crosses. In his hand he held a sickle. His habits were ascetic; he never married, and was most chaste and pure in his life, and is said to have endured penance in a neighboring mountain, not for its effect upon himself, but as an example to others. . . . He condemned sacrifices, except of fruit or flowers, and was known as the god of peace; for when addressed on the subject of war, he is reported to have stopped his ears with his fingers.* 'Fray Bernardino de Sahagun described Quetza1coatl as very homely, with a long head and a very long beard. There was a recumbent statue of him in the temple at Tulla which was always covered with blankets. \"His vassals,\" writes the good Fray, \"were all workmen in the mechanic arts and skillful in cutting the green stones called Cha1chivites, also in the art of smelting silver and making other objects. All these arts had their origin and commencement with Quet- zalcoatI, who had houses made with these precious green stones called Cha1chivites and others made of silver, still others made of red and white shells, others all made of boards, and again others of turquoises, and some all made of rich plumes. . . . \"Quetzalcoatl also owned all the wealth of the world in gold, silver, and the green stones called Chalcivites, and other precious things; and had a great abundance of cocoa- trees of different colors, which are called xochicacatlao.

They also say that the said Quetzalcoatl did penance by pricking his limbs and drawing blood, with which he stained the maguey points; that he bathed at midnight in a spring called xicapaya.\"* The interpreter of the Codex Telleriano-Remensis said that Quetzalcoatl was created by the breath of Tonacate- cotli. Quetzalcoatl was born on the day of Seven Canes, and disappeared or died on the day of One Cane. He was identified with the planet Venus. The Codex Vaticanus A. says that the hero founded four temples: the first for the princes; the second for the people; the third, the House of Fear or Serpents; and the fourth, the Temple of Shame. The Codex Chimalpopca says that Quetzalcoatl was born as a nine-year-old child. When he resolved to leave Mexico, he reached the seashore, and, removing his clothing and his snake mask of turquoise, destroyed himself by fire. His ashes changed into birds, and his heart became the morning star. He remained four days in the underworld and four days as a corpse. After that he ascended to heaven as a god. It is specifically mentioned by Sahagun that Quetzalcoatl created and built houses under the earth. Traces of sub- terranean grottoes and rooms have been discovered in the vicinity of most of the architectural monuments of the Nahuas. There is a vast complex of such apartments near the Pyramid of the Sun at San Juan Teotihuacan. The Amerindians believed the serpent to be an earth dweller, and it is quite possible that the accounts implied these sub- terranean and secret places to be chambers of initiation into the mysteries of the cult. According to de Bourbourg, the Mexican demigod Votan made a journey through a sub- terranean passage which, running under ground, terminated \"See A History oj Ancient Mexico."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 THE ADEPTS at the root of heaven.

Lucien Biart summarizes the available data: \"The most contradictory ideas have been current in re- gard to this divinity, who, now considered of celestial origin, and now regarded as a man who had acquired the im- mortality of the gods, seems in reality to be a union of several personages ....

According to Sahagun, the most usual ornaments of the images of Quetzalcoatl were a mitre spotted like the skin of a tiger, a short embroidered tunic, turquoise ear-rings, and a golden collar supporting fine shells. The legs of these images were encased in gaiters of tiger-skins, and on their feet were black sandals. A shield hung from the left arm, and in the right hand was a scepter ornamented with precious stones, an emblem which terminated in a crook like a bishop's crosier.\"* Quetzalcoatl is credited with the invention of the pictorial or hieroglyphical method of writing, and especially is his name associated with the Tonalamatl, or Book of Fate. This was more than a civil calendar and was reserved for the calculation of human destiny and prophecies concern- ing the future of the State. It was used by \"master magicians,\" the chief of whom was an astrological adept credited with extraordinary occult powers. While it is likely that Quetza1coatl brought the Tonalamatl back to Mexico after his journey among the Mayas, a people already advanced in such matters, the Aztecan legend has been summarized by Mendieta. The gods had created a man, Oxomoco, and a woman, Cipactonatl, as the pro- genitors of the human race. They dwelt in a cave at Cuernavaca, and in order to regulate their lives these two resolved to devise a calendar. Cipactonatl felt that her descendant, Quetzalcoatl, should be invited to participate in the project. Because she was the mother of all the living and a great prophetess, Cipactonatl was privileged to select and write the first sign or day-symbol of the calendar. The others followed until the thirteen signs were completed. * See The Aztecs,Their History, Manners, and Customs -(Chicago, 1929.)-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 THE ADEPTS Sahagun, in his General History, gave a number of details of the struggle between QuetzalcoatI, the civilizer, and Tezcatlipoca, who apparently signified the primitive and sanguine religious cult of Mexico.

Accompanied by a procession of musicians, youths, and maidens bearing flowers, and flocks of singing birds, the old adept journeyed to Cholula, where the great pyramid was built in his honor. It was written that the Cholulans deeply admired the great priest because of the purity of his life, the kindliness of his manner, and his doctrines of peace and brotherhood. He remained with them for nearly twenty years, slowly sickening from the poison which was destroying his body. At last he realized that his ministry was coming to an end, so he continued his long journey toward the mysterious city of Tlapallan from which he had come. He turned toward the east and proceeded to the sea, which he reached at a point a few miles south of Vera Cruz. Here he blessed the four young men who had accompanied him and bade them return to their homes, with his promise that one day in the future he would return and restore his kingdom among them. Then the old and weary man called to the sea, and out of the waters came a raft of serpents. He stepped upon this strange craft and was carried away into the land of the sun's beginning. He left behind him a priesthood that per- petuated with esoteric rites the Mysteries of the Feathered Serpent. There is every indication that the cult of Quetzal- coati was kept secret, a precaution necessary in the face of the opposition of the primitive indigenous sects. There are several accounts of the death or departure of Quetzalcoatl.

They told him enough to convince a thoughtful man of the existence of Esoteric Schools in the Mayan area. \"That sacred mysteries,\" writes LePlongeon, \"have existed in America from times immemorial, there can be no doubt. Even setting aside the proofs of their existence, that we gather from the monuments of Uxmal, and the descriptions of the trials of initiation related in the sacred book of the Quiches, we find vestiges of them in various other countries of the Western Continent. \"The rites and ceremonies of initiation were imported in Peru by the ancestors of Manco Capac, the founder of the Inca dynasty, who were colonists from Central America, as we learn from an unpublished MS, written by a jesuit father, Red. Anello Oliva, at the beginning of the year 1631, in Lima; and now in the library of the British Museum in London.\"* A number of authors have tried to prove that Quetza1coatl was a foreigner who, reaching the shores of the New World at an early time, attempted the civilization of the aboriginal tribes. Lord Kingsborough favored the possibility that this wanderer was the Apostle Thomas, and that the ancient Central American Indians came under Christian or Jewish influence. Always deeply concerned with the possibilities of linking the worship in the Americas with the religions of the Near East, his lordship writes: \"The Messiah is shadowed in the Old Testament under many types; such as those of a lion, a lamb, a roe, the morning star, (or the planet Venus, other- wise called Lucifer,) the sun, light, a rock, a stone, the branch, the vine, wine, bread, water, life, the way, and he *See Sacred Mysteries Among the Mayas and the Quiches."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 THE ADEPTS is there recognized in the triple character of a king, a priest, and a prophet. It is very extraordinary that Quetzalcoatl, whom the Mexicans believed equally to have been a king, a prophet, and a pontiff, should also have been named by them Ceyacatl, or the morning star; Tlavizcalpantecutli, or light; Mexitli, or the vine, (for Torquemada said that the core of the aloe, from which the Mexicans obtained wine, was so called) ; Votan, or the heart, metaphorically signifying life; and Toyliatlaquatl, 'manjar de nuestra veda,' bread, (for his body made of dough was eaten by the Mexicans. ) ,,* Las Casas, quoting Padre Francisco Hernandez, says that an old Yucatecan described the ancient religion of his people thus: \"That [they] recognized and believed in God who dwells in heaven, and that this God was Father and Son and Holy Spirit, and that the Father was called leona, who had created men and all things, that the Son was called Bacab, and that he was born of a virgin called Chibirias, who is in heaven with God; the Holy Spirit they termed Echuac.\" The son Bacab was scourged and crowned with thorns, was tied upon a cross with extended arms, where he died; but after three days he arose and ascended into heaven to be with his father. Dr. Alexander, who reports this story in his book, is inclined to feel that it is confused and probably distorted by the Spanish recorder. On the other hand, the universal distribution of the basic theme may be explained another way. Among the Lacandones, Quetza1coatl is still represented as a snake with many heads. There is an account that this snake was killed and eaten at times of great national peril, especially at eclipses, which were regarded as portents of disaster.

Daniel Brinton, in his Essays of an A mericanist, devoted some thought to the magical powers attributed to the priests of Central America. He mentioned Father Baeza and an English priest, Thomas Gage, who reported cases of sor- cerers transforming themselves into animals, and perform- ing miracles. De Bourbourg was not entirely convinced that ventriloquism, animal magnetism, or the tricks familiarly employed by conjurers explained the mysteries of nagualism, as the black art of these Indians is called. Brinton quotes from the Popul Vuh: \"Truly this Gucumatz [Quetza1coatl] became a wonderful king. Every seven days he ascended to the sky, and every seven days he followed the path to the abode of the dead; every seven days he put on the nature of a serpent and he became truly a serpent; every seven days he put on the nature of an eagle and again of a tiger, and he became truly an eagle and a tiger; ... \" It is evident from available authorities that the Mayas and Aztecs had an extensive body of legendry and lore, which originated in the mysteries of their religions and proves the existence of an elaborate system of secret rites and ceremonies. In the form of a feathered snake, Quetza1coatl over- shadowed a dynasty of rulers and priests, some of whom later assumed his name and even his mask-symbol. These later Quetza1coatls have been confused, like the several Zoroasters of Persia, into one person, with the resulting con- flict in dates.

Children were consecrated to his temples from their birth and were marked by a special collar. At the end of the second year the child was scarified in the breast. When it was seven years old it entered a seminary where it took vows covering personal conduct and public duties, including prayers for the preservation of its family and its nation. There were many of these priestly Brotherhoods, and the Spanish missionaries, in spite of their theological prejudices and intolerances, were forced to admit that the Aztecan priests were excellent scholars and lived austere and pure lives. It was said of these mission- aries that \"in Quetza1coatl, who taught charity, gentleness, and peace, they thought they saw a disciple of Jesus Christ.\" The kings of the Mexican nations, like those of ancient Egypt, were also initiates of the State Mysteries. Torque- mada described the attainments of Nazahualpilli, the king of Texcuco. This learned man gathered about him masters of the sciences and arts, and gained a wide reputation as an astrologer and seer.

Obviously, archaeologists cannot discover the secret rites merely by grubbing among the overturned and broken stones. As the priesthoods were not considerate enough to label their monuments, there is little left today even to excite curiosity. Fortunately, however, the esoteric tradition survives in the racial subconscious, and its violated schools and colleges need not be physically restored. When such restoration is attempted, the buildings usually reveal that they were designed as symbols of the cosmos. If the Mystery system existed in the Western Hemisphere, as the landmarks indicate, it must have produced its initiates and adepts. These, in tum, became the leaders and saviors of their peoples. The wonder-working hero, whose deeds enriched all tribal traditions, always and every- where performed the same miracles, possessed the same powers, and made the same personal sacrifices. The Mystery School required not only a hierarchy for its maintenance and perpetuation, but also appropriate places of initiation partly underground or adjacent to. grottoes and caverns. It required also a body of lore peculiarly significant, participation in which conferred special rights and privileges. A people which had reached the mental platform of the Mayas would not have accepted a philosophy of life that was without profound and signifi- cant values. Pagan priesthoods did not initiate those of feeble mind, but selected for spiritual advancement persons of high attainment and mature judgment.

The Popul Vuh, or The Senate Book of the Quiches J the Record of the Community, has survived the numerous vicissitudes which have con- spired to prevent the perpetuation of the literary monu- ments of Central America. It was tolerated by the early missionaries who, observing certain similarities to their own Scriptures, preserved the work as a means of persuading the Indians to a more speedy baptism. In the 17th century, it was rescued from a fate worse than oblivion by the Dominican monk, Don Ramon de Ordonez y Aguiar, dean and chancellor of the archbishopric of Ciudad Real. The work was deposited in the library of the convent at Chichi- castenango by its scholiast, Ximenes, where it remained until 1830. The manuscript of the Popul V uh was rediscovered about 1855 by Dr. Scherzer in the library of the University of San Carlos, Guatemala City. Through the industry and scholarship of that ardent antiquarian, the Abbe Bras- seur de Bourbourg, this mysterious book of the Quiches came at last to the French language, where it lingered for years awaiting English translation. Dr. Scherzer was re- sponsible for a Spanish version published in Vienna in 1856. The first English translation has remained practically un- known to students of Central American archaeology, as it appeared serially in Th.e Word J a magazine devoted to Theosophical and related subjects.

To have secured it, the compiler must himself have been a priest or initiate. Certainly, the Popul Vuh is by far the outstanding available text on pre- Columbian mythology and cosmogony. The Quichean scribe, in his introduction to the Popul Vuh, writes: \"The following is what we shall write, and we place it in writing because, since the 'Word of God' has been promulgated, and hereafter during the cycle of Chris- tianity, the Book of the Azure-green-veil is no longer to be seen, in which it could be clearly perceived that it had come from the further shore of the Sea; which Book has been called 'The Record of our existence in the Overshadowing World, and how we there beheld Light and Life.''' (Note: This translation by Pryse is somewhat fuller than that given by Guthrie, and seems to be more in the spirit of the Quiche tradition.) The implication is that the work originated behind the Azure Veil. This can have two meanings: either the veil which divides the spiritual universe from the material world, or the veil in the temple of initiation, behind which are, the Seven Lords of the Great Heart. The P'opul V uhconsists of a mythology gradually min- gling in its descent with the beginnings of history. The early part deals almost entirely with superhuman beings, and the latter part with the heroic deeds of authentic per- sonages. It opens with a description of the creation. All was calm and silent, and the face of the earth was not yet to he seen. In the eternal darkness and quietude was the Creator-the Lord and Maker-and Gucumatz, the plumed serpent. They were surrounded with green and azure, and they were those who engendered. Then \"The Word\" came and spake with them, and they joined their counsels.

Guthrie presents a number of important parallelisms to the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Greeks. According to him, the twelve trials or tests through which the neophytes pass are analogous with the signs of the zodiac. He goes so far as to hazard the specula- , don that the twelve princes of Xibalba were the rulers of the Atlantean Empire, and their final destruction referred to the tragic end of Atlantis. The Popul Yuh follows the traditional form by involving its principle characters in a series of superhuman and super- natural adventures. The work is certainly an account of the \"perilous journey,\" which is the usual means employed to veil thinly the story of initiation. By comparison with the oral traditions of the Northern Amerindian tribes, the legend unfolds what Dr. Paul Radin beautifully calls \"the road of light.\" Medicine priests have freely acknowledged that in dreams and trances they could leave their bodies and travel to the abodes of the gods and the dead. To make this journey while still living is initiation, for it is con- scious participation in the fact of immortality. In some cults the neophyte was given sacred drugs to intensify his psychic faculties, as in the case of the notorious Peyote sect, or was subjected to hypnotic influence, like the followers of the ghost-shirt religion. By some means a condition of death was simulated and the consciousness or superior self passed through certain internal experiences\" of which at least a partial memory was preserved.

Pryse suggests that Matthew 10: 16 explains the symbol- ism of the snake-bird: \"Behold, I send you as sheep [neophytes] into the midst of wolves [the profane]: be ye therefore wise as serpents [magicians], and guileless as doves [mystics].\" Mr. Pryse was a Greek scholar and his transla- tion differed slightly from the King James Version. He felt that the quetzal had the same meaning as dove, and that the creature combining the serpent-wisdom and the bird-intuition or -inspiration represented the adept, in whom the mind and heart doctrine were completely reconciled. The conflict between the initiate and the adversary, or the paths of white and black magic, is always present. In the story of Deganawida, the power of evil was personified by Atotarho, an old war chieftain, who had a cluster of venomous serpents on his head in place of hair. The Mexican Quetzalcoatl was attacked by the red god of war. The adversary personified either older cults which opposed the establishment of the benevolent Mysteries or later cults responsible for the destruction of these institutions. In either case an inferior state of spiritual enlightenment was implied. The Mysteries were institutions of liberation and were naturally opposed by groups seeking to keep their people in bondage through ignorance. The struggle was, therefore, between religion as temporal authority and the Mystery faith-the internal \"road of light.\" The ruins of the past explain why it was the common belief that the men of good spirit, the initiates, were sacrificed to the material ambitions of temporal rulers."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"AMERICA'S ASSIGNMENT WITH DESTINY 33 A merican I ndian Mysticism All the aboriginal tribes of North America practiced mystical and magical rites, and vestiges of an esoteric tradi- tion, served by a priestly class distinguished for sagacity and personal integrity, are still to be found among surviving groups. Scattered over a vast area and divided further by lack of a common language, these nomadic bands were approaching the horizon of national existence when the European colonists conquered their lands, decimated their tribes, and destroyed their cultural' patterns. So diversified were the traditions of these peoples that it is difficult to summarize their beliefs and doctrines, especially after their legends, histories, and religious institutions were corrupted by outside influences. The European colonists were of no mind to search for the mystical secrets of the Indian \"life-way.\" These settlers brought their own religious beliefs, which they were resolved to force upon the natives. There were no ethnologists or anthropologists among the Puritans, and many important landmarks of Indian philosophy were destroyed before they had been honestly investigated or appraised. Most of the tribal lore was in the keeping of priests and elders, and if these were killed or died without finding suitable suc- cessors the traditions ended. Even today older Indians find it difficult to select younger men to perpetuate the sacred institutions. Thus it is unwise to assume that from avail- able fragments a complete picture of Indian mysticism can be reconstructed. The Indian has always been an individualist, and neither circumstance nor inclination induced him to form extensive intertribal organizations. His way of life and the vast silences of his homeland caused him to turn within himself for courage, wisdom, and faith. He could not visit distant shrines of learning or sit at the feet of famous teachers."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 THE ADEPTS There were no books to ponder and no ancient sages to guide his religious convictions. Few strangers visited his camp with news or opinions from far places. He was part of a small family, and the tribal life, with its simple lore, was his only source of cultural tradition. A thoughtful observer of Nature about him, the Indian lived constantly in the presence of mysteries, with no refer- ence frame other than his own imagination. Though stoical in appearance, he was highly emotional, as indicated by his songs, dances, and festivals. His sensory perceptions were acute, and his legends indicate strong dramatic instincts. Among advanced tribes, according to Dr. Franz Boas: \" ... an elaborate series of esoteric doctrines and practices exists, which are known to only a small portion of the tribe, while the mass of the people are familiar only with part of the ritual and with its exoteric features. For this reason we often find the religious beliefs and practices of the mass of a tribe rather heterogeneous as compared with the beliefs held by the priests. Among many of the tribes in which priests are found, we find distinct esoteric societies, and it is not by any means rare that the doctrines of one society are not in accord with those of another .... Esoteric forms of religion in charge of priests are found among the tribes of the arid region of the Southwest, the tribes of the south- ern Mississippi basin, and to a less extent among the more northerly tribes on the Plains. It would seem that, on the whole, the import of the esoteric teachings decreases among the more northerly and northeasterly tribes of the continent.'

They healed the sick, protected their tribes, directed the migrations of their peoples, and sought by extrasensory means the location of food, water, and other necessities. They predicted the future, induced rain and storms, projected themselves to distant places, and read the hearts and minds of their fellow men. It was in their power to induce visions and trances, and to receive the impressions of the star-spirits. They also gained considerable proficiency in the mesmeric and hypnotic arts. Charles F. Lummis, who spent many years among the Southwest Indians of the United States, described the miracles performed by the medicine priests. Although naturally skeptical, his experiences among the Navajo and Pueblo Indians impressed him deeply. Mr. Lummis men- tioned how Indians seated in their medicine lodge created miniature thunderstorms within the room, accompanied by flashes of forked lightning, while the outside sky was entirely clear. He says: \"How the effects are produced I am utterly unable to explain, but they are startlingly real.\" He was also impressed by the ability of the priests to change themselves into animals in the presence of spec- tators. Some priests could create an artificial sun inside the lodge.

The world consisted -From Lummis' Some Strange Corners of Our Country NAV A]O INDIAN MAGICIANS GROWING THE SACRED CORN of three regions, with human beings inhabiting the surface of the central zone. Above this middle land was an airy expanse extending to the abode of the Sky-Father. Below the surface were subterranean levels extending downward to the place of the earth-mother. This cavernous region was like the dark and shadowy underworld of the pre- Homeric Greeks. \"Sec Some Strange Corners of Our Country, by Charles F. Lummis,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38 THE ADEPTS In the Southwest legends, human beings originated be- neath the earth in a kind of paradisiacal land. There, also, were mountains, valleys, and beautiful plains, and a sun and moon that lighted the region. In the beginning every- one was happy, but later an evil deed brought upon them the wrath of the gods. In most accounts this lovely shadow- land was destroyed by a flood. In some miraculous manner a few righteous persons were preserved and took refuge on a tall plant, which, growing rapidly, finally broke through the surface of the middle land, bringing the survivors to safety. The secrets of healing, prophecy, and magic came to the Indian from an order of beings called manitos. This Algonquian word is now applied to the concept of powerful governing spirits. The manitos were not actually gods, but superhuman manlike creatures, possessing extraordinary attributes and frequently considered as giants. The size factor, however, is figurative rather than literal. The manitos were a divine invisible tribe-masters of magic- to whom human beings could tum for help and guidance whenever necessity arose. The effort to explain the term manito as only signifying a \"wonderful power\" and synonymous with the Iroquois orenda is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the Indian religious philosophy. Orenda conveys more precise- ly a power ·or energy universally present in animate and inanimate creatures, and manifesting through the vital processes which cause things to exist, to function, and to affect other existing and functioning things.

The fundamental concept bearing on the religious life of the individual is the belief in the exist- ence of magic power, which may influence the life of man, and which in tum may be influenced by human activity. In this sense magic power must be understood as the won- derful qualities which are believed to exist in objects, animals, men, spirits, or deities, and which are superior to the natural qualities of man.\"* Most religions and metaphysical philosophies include hierarchies of divine creatures, or tutelary spirits, as media- tors between the Supreme Being and mortals. The manitos acted as wise distributors of the orenda. The Indian fashioned these demigods in his own likeness, but bestowed upon them superior powers. The manitos were aware of the most secret human thoughts and the most pressing human needs, and were capable of responding immediately to the rituals of the priests and elders. When the medicine man journeyed to the spirit land, he might be invited to attend a council of manitos. When he came to the Great Lodge in the sky, it resembled an earthly council place, except that it was larger, more elegant, and usually filled with a strange light. The manitos were venerable sachems, usually handsome old men, their faces full of kindness. There was a council fire, the smoking of the calumet, and the usual speeches and discussions. The Lodge was a kind of superphysical senate where all matters of grave import were decided. When the session was concluded, the priest *See Handbook of American Indians, Smithsonian Institution, Bulletin 30, article \"Religion.\""},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40 THE ADEPTS returned to his people along the \"sky road\" and reported the decisions of the Great Lodge. Between the manitos and mankind were the souls of the illustrious dead. These were the Olds and the Trues, the sages of long ago, the great chieftains, warriors, and states- men. They had led their people in life, so they continued to guard them from the other land, speaking through the medicine men. It seemed natural to the Amerinds that the heroes who had gone before should continue to serve the tribes they had guided in the long ago. Totemism was a kind of heraldry among the Indians. The totem was the clan symbol; but more than that, it was a channel for the distribution of orenda through the social and political structure of the clan. The totemic animal or bird was a spirit guardian, helpful because the creature possessed attributes superior in some particular to those of man. The attribute might be swiftness, strength, cunning- ness, or resourcefulness, and these qualities the totem crea- ture shared with those under its guardianship. Each Indian also had his own totem, and while it took a familiar form it was identical in principle with the guardian daemon described in works on the Egyptian and Chaldean Mysteries. It was considered a good omen to see one's totem while practicing vigil, or in dreams or trances. I t proved the proximity of a protecting power. The Abbe Phavenet, a missionary to the Algonquians, identifies the totem (from ote, the ototeman of the Chip- pewas) with the manito concept in these words: \"It is to be presumed that in uniting into a tribe, each clan preserves its manitou, the animal which in the country whence the clan came was the most beautiful or the most friendly to man, or the most feared, or the most common; the animal which was ordinarily hunted there and which was the ordinary subsistence of the clan, etc.; and this animal be-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"AMERICA'S ASSIGNMENT WITH DESTINY 41 came the symbol of each family and that each family trans- mitted it to its posterity to be the perpetual symbol of each tribe [clan].\" Modem ethnologists have emphasized that the popular usage of the term totem is incorrect. The symbol is not strictly religious, but involves a social and family concept with emphasis upon the importance of kinship. Many tribes, especially the Plains Indians, believed that thunder and lightning were caused by enormous birds-the rumbling sounds in the sky accompanying storms were due to the flapping of their wings, and the flashes of light were caused by the opening and closing of their eyes. In some groups, only one thunderbird was recognized; in other tribes, there were several of various colors or a family of them. The appearance of the bird, or birds, is not definite- ly given; it might be similar to a large hawk, an eagle, or even a grouse. The thunderbird could use its wings as a bow to shoot arrows, and small meteors were believed to be the heads of these arrows. On the Plains, thunderstorms were said to result from a contest between a thunderbird and a huge rattlesnake, or dragonlike monster. Persons struck by lightning, if they recovered, were accepted as sages or holy men, having received a very strong medicine from the experience. In some areas the thunderbird was closely associated with the religious Mysteries or Societies. Those who saw this creature in their vigils usually considered themselves as intended for a religious life. The myths and legends of the thunderbird are similar to the European and Asiatic accounts of the fabled phoenix, which nested in flames and symbolized initiation and adeptship. Early drawings of the Great Seal of the United States indicate that the bird represented thereon was a phoenix rather than an eagle. Like the Mexican coat of arms, which shows an eagle with"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42 THE ADEPTS a serpent in its claws, the American device is strongly reminiscent of a thunderbird. These creatures were also said to inhabit a sky-world above the clouds, and served as messengers between mortals and the heavenly beings. Farther south the thunderbird symbol merged with the quetzal and the serpent feathered with quetzal plumes. The quetzal was identical in meaning with the phoenix of Asia, North Africa, and the Near East. The feathered- serpent symbolism can be traced back to the hooded N agas, or serpent gods of India, and to the winged serpents which occur in the writings and sculpturings of the Egyptians. The serpent was the messenger and servant of the earth- mother because it dwelt below ground. For this reason rattlesnakes were released during the snake dances, in order that they might carry the petitions of the tribe to the mother who dwelt below. Birds were also carriers of tidings, and as they flew upward they bore with them prayers to the Great Father who lived in the Sky-Lodge. The thunderbird was the most powerful and was the lord of flying things. The thunderbird and the feathered snake were symbolical of the mysteries of the upper and lower regions. Priestly Orders served this twofold cult, the secrets of which were revealed only by an internal mystical experience. Brinton, describing various devices used by the Amerin- dian tribes to conserve their religious secrets, says: \"All these stratagems were intended to shroud with impenetrable secrecy the mysteries of the brotherhood. With the same motive, the priests formed societies of different grades of illumination, only to be entered by those willing to undergo trying ordeals whose secrets were not to be revealed under the severest penalties. The Algonkins had three such, grades, the ioaubeno. the meda, and the [ossakeed, the last r~in? the hi~hest. To this no white man was ever admitted."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"AMERICA'S ASSIGNMENT WITH DESTINY 43 All tribes appear to have been controlled by these secret societies. ,,* Among the Amerindians, Secret Societies existed for the perpetuation and enlargement of the choicest knowledge of the tribe. There were war associations, healing cults, and Fraternities concerned with the religious Mysteries, the keeping of records, and the dramatization of myths. There were ethical societies, orders of mirth-makers, fire-walkers, and hunters, presided over by elders who had distinguishing regalia. Women frequently became leaders of these groups. Among the Pueblo Indians there were often a dozen or more Societies in one village. While their objectives were not always parallel, there was no friction between the mem- berships and they united in all common responsibilities. t The Indian was always a tolerant man on the subject of spiritual convictions. He never inquired as to the faith of his guest, but expected that every true believer would con- duct himself in an honorable way. He respected the rites of strangers, and if he did not share in them or did not understand their meanings, he kept a respectful silence. The reference to the dramatization of myths suggests that a number of Indian tribes were practicing the same methods of presenting religious Mysteries that were em- ployed by the Greeks and Egyptians. Most Indian festivals emphasized songs and dances, but the songs were used principally to establish rhythms and the words were of slight importance. Chants were a vital element in most healing ceremonies. Either the Western Hemisphere received a vital religious stimulus from early voyagers and travelers from distant parts or else the Indian himself by mystical experiences 'See Myths of the New World (New York, 1876). tSee Dr, John Swanton, in Handbook of North American Indians, article \"Secret Societies.

The cross was an important symbol in the Midewiwin Rites, and it is interesting that the Mides steadfastly refused to give up their religion and be converted to Christianity. The controversy as to the possible Masonic significance of the Midewiwin Rites may be noted, but has slight bear- ing upon the essential facts. Although the birchbark rolls have bestowed prominence upon the activities of this Society, other tribes practiced equally significant rituals and ceremonies. Candidates advanced through four de- grees, traveling toward the east, and the lodge rooms were enclosures open to the sky and connecting with each other through doors and passageways. The neophyte was tested and subjected to trials and hazards and also was presented with a sequence of visual arrangements of symbols and other esoteric paraphernalia. The purpose of the Great Medicine Society was to enlighten the human mind and soul and to bind the initiates to the service of their people. It included a method for stimulating extrasensory percep- tions and personal investigation into the secrets of Nature. In 1919, Arthur C. Parker was invited into a secret lodge of the Senecas to witness their ceremonies. Here he heard the legend of Red Hand, a culture hero, who could hold conversation with the Great Mystery. From the Great Mystery he learned to love all the creatures of the earth, and he spoke the language of the birds and animals.

The two great leaders of these Amerinds were Deganawida and Hiawatha. It is impossible to study the life of Deganawida, whose coming was announced by a mysterious visitor from the heaven-world, without realizing that he fulfilled all the requirements of the adept tradition. Deganawida was born of an immaculate conception, possessed the power to work miracles, prayed and fasted, practiced the vigils, was confirmed in his mission by the Great Father, and passed through numerous trials and persecutions. Hiawatha be- came his first and most distinguished disciple, and these two working together sought to establish everlasting peace among their peoples. The founder of the Inca dynasty of Peru was the initiate- statesman, Manco Capac, who flourished in the 11 th cen- tury A.D. He reformed the social and religious life of the tribes of the Aymara Quichua race. In the capital city of Cuzco which he built, Manco Capac established the religion of the sun. He was a stateman of ability, and claimed to be a direct descendant of the sun god. The empire of the Incas which he founded is remembered especially for its experiments in socialized living.

He is said to have brought with him to Peru a divine bird in a sacred wicker hamper. This golden falcon is a form of the phoenix, and testifies to the presence of the adept doctrine. Manco Capac combines in his own person the offices of priest and king, like the Melchizedeks of Christian mysticism. Although some historians may be a trifle impulsive when they suggest that Manco Capac was a Buddhist priest, there can be no doubt that the Peruvian culture was heavily influenced by symbols, rituals, and philosophical elements usually associated with the trans-Himalayan area of Central Asia. In Deganawida, with his Great League, Quetzalcoatl- Kulku1can and his splendid socialized empires in Mexico and Central America, and Manco Capac and the com- munal system which he set up in Peru, we have three clear and definite accounts of initiate-leaders establishing schools of esoteric doctrines in the Western Hemisphere.

The true story was in the keeping of the Mystery Schools, and passed from them to the Secret Societies of the medieval world. The Esoteric Orders of Europe, Asia, and the Near East were in at least irregular communication with the priesthoods of the more advanced Amerindian nations. Plans for the development of the Western Hemisphere were formulated in Alexandria, Mecca, Delhi, and Lhasa long before most European statesmen were aware of the great Utopian program.* The explorers who opened the New World operated from a master plan and were agents of rediscovery rather than discoverers. Very little is \"known\" about the origin, lives, characters, and policies of these intrepid adventurers. Although they lived in a century amply provided with historians and biographers, these saw fit either to remain silent or to invent plausible accounts without substance. Does it not seem remarkable that no one is certain whether Christopher Columbus was actually an English prince, a Greek nobleman, or a Genoese sea captain? Was he granted arms without any examination into his ancestry? Why is it so difficult to ascertain the real name of the man known as Amerigo Vespucci? Who was John Cabot, whose life and exploits are but fragments rather than the sober records of a distinguished citizen? If these men were what they seemed to be, there could have been no advantage gained by such elaborate concealment. If there were a mystery, that which was hidden must have been regarded as valuable.

This would explain and justify Bacon's restoration of the fable, which was nothing more than bringing into light matters long hidden. According to the Criiias, the oceans became so agitated and laden with mud and slime that navigation to the west ceased. Sailors feared to go beyond the Pillars of Hercules toward those Hesperic Isles sacred to the Mysteries. Even had Christian nations dared to violate the edicts of the Secret Schools, such audacity would have been held in check by the power of Islam, seated in the Holy House at Cairo, and the edicts of Lhasa, backed by the armed strength of the Mongol Empire. The East agreed to pre- serve the boundaries of Europe, if the European States would bind themselves in a solemn alliance to refrain from exploiting the resources of the Western Hemisphere. Fear of a terrible retribution from beyond the walls of Gog and Magog prevented the Popes from violating their agree- ment. And without the leadership of the Church, the great families dared not engage in private projects. When the appointed hour came, the Secret Societies selected their own agents to initiate the program of exploration. \"Was Columbus then working,\" asks Grace A.

The opposing faction of historians insists that Columbus possessed considerable scholarship even be- fore his celebrated journey. According to Henry Harisse, an outstanding writer on the Columbus mystery, the navi- gator left ninety-seven manuscripts and over twenty-five thousand marginalia, which may be considered a remark- able achievement for an illiterate. The truth is that the admiral cannot be explained without reference to the Secret Societies, which were the peculiar custodians of the exact information which he required. The religious and mystical inclinations of the great dis- coverer are mentioned by most of his biographers. At times Columbus dressed in a plain robe and girdle similar to the costume of the Franoiscan Order. It was reported by his son that Columbus died wearing a Franciscan frock.

Several religious groups of the times, including Fraternities known to be connected with the esoteric tradition, favored this kind of habit.

The admiral regarded himself as chosen by heaven to fulfill a great mission, and was strengthened by the con- viction that he was guarded and guided by the divine providence. Such contemporary reports could imply far more than modern writers would like to acknowledge. In those troublous times, it was customary for the members of Secret Societies to conceal the true source of their instructions by some general statement about heavenly. guidance. The mystical instincts of the admiral, his belief in miracles, prophecies, and the doctrine of preordination have been advanced by some critics as proofs of his mental instability. Referring to what he calls the \"colossal, mystical self- confidence\" of Columbus, John Bartlet Brebner writes that it was so integral a part of the navigator that \"he could believe on one occasion in his voyaging that God had led him to the New Heaven and New Earth of Revelation, and in his darkest hour he knew that God spoke to him in encouragement.\" On his Third Voyage, the navigator believed that he heard the voice of God speaking words of strength and comfort. On his Fourth Voyage, when great emergencies threatened the entire enterprise, the admiral fell into a trance and a voice spoke to him: \"0 fool, and slow to believe and to serve thy God, the God of all!

It has even been suggested that he had contacted the religious and political convictions of the secret Christian sect of the J ohannites, which played so large a part in the esoteric doctrines of the Templars. Cabot conveniently found the ear of the English king, and was immediately entrusted with a delicate diplomatic mission to Denmark to arbitrate disputes over the fisheries of Iceland. Grace Fendler also notes that the records of the English Privy Purse shows a pension paid to one Antonio Cabot for several years after John Cabot was historically dead. The pension passed through the hands of an English merchant named Rid D' Americke. The voyages of Cabot were important inasmuch as they resulted in a division which gave most of North America to the English group which was free from the theological and mercenary pressures of the Spanish program. The Great Plan reached the Western Hemisphere through a series of incidents. Many early explorers and colonizers are known to have been associated with Secret Societies. There is no historical way of determining the secret spiritual convictions of so-called conquistadors, ad- venturers, and founders of plantations.

The work, then as always, was in the hands and keeping of a few initiated leaders. They were responsible for the results, and they built slowly and wisely, thinking not 0 ftheir own days or of their own reputa- tion, but of the future in which the Great Plan would be fulfilled. The Colonization Scheme The political intrigues which Queen Elizabeth had in- herited from Henry VIII plagued Her Majesty's advisors throughout her long reign. Henry had rebelled against the papacy, ousted its clergy, closed its monastic houses, confiscated its properties, and established the Church of England. Spain, motivated by both religious and secular considerations, was resolved to control England. The Spanish ambassador at the court of the Tudors was the moving spirit behind an elaborate program of espionage, and all that he could learn, glean, or deduce was dispatched posthaste to his royal master, the King of Spain. While serving his diplomatic apprenticeship at the court of Navarre, Bacon had been initiated into the new liberal- ism represented throughout Europe by Secret Societies of intellectuals dedicated to civil and religious freedom. He returned to England fully aware of the intentions of Philip II, the Spanish king. Later, when the moment was propitious, he threw the weight of his literary group with the English colonization plan for America in order to pre- vent Spanish domination of the New World. The same political considerations apparently also induced him to develop Freemasonry as a further bulwark against the encroachments of the Spanish plot.

I t was necessary for Bacon to conceal both his purposes and the machinery for their fulfillment from the Spanish spies. If the project were prematurely revealed, it could precipitate a desperate political situation. With many courtiers secretly sympathizing with the cause of Spain, and Elizabeth's claim to the throne questioned because of Henry's numerous divorces, it was impossible to use such conventional channels as were provided by an uneasy gov- ernment. Bacon protected both his cause and his country by acting privately and maturing his schemes within the hallowed walls of the Inns of Court. There in the sanctuary of the martyred Templars, who had earlier felt the full weight of ecclesiastical displeasure, he labored industrious ... ly to fashion wings for the White Horse of Britain. The rapid progress of England in the second half of the 16th and the first half of the 17th centuries was due not only to the appearance of a select coterie of wits, but also to the more liberal atmosphere which resulted from \"Harry's\" religious house cleaning. After the Armada, the issues were partly clarified, but it still remained vital to protect and enlarge the English interests in the Western Hemisphere. Incidentally, the ships of the Armada carried ninety Spanish Inquisitors, with all the paraphernalia of their office, ready to set up the Inquisition in conquered England. The Pope had already claimed the three Amer- icas for the Church, but the English colonizers were resolved to dispute this claim with every resource at their disposal.

In 1609, Sir George Somers was appointed governor of the colony of Virginia. He sailed for the New World with dignity appropriate to his office, but his arrival was delayed when his ship foundered on the Hog Islands. Later he was able to victual two pinnaces with prime pork and to proceed on his journey. The Hog Islands, so-named be- cause of the wild swine that infested them, were renamed the Somers Islands in honor of Sir George's impromptu visit. Ultimately, however, these islands were called the Bermudas, after the Spanish navigator, Juan Bermudez. In 1609, James I granted a charter to the Bermuda Com- THE SOMERS ISLANDS SHILLING pany, and in 1612, Richard More and sixty colonists from Virginia settled on one of the islands.

The history of this coinage is extremely obscure. The Hog Money, as it is often called, was of brass and in three denominations. The shilling of this issue bears on the obverse the legend \"Sommer Islands,\" surrounding the figure of a wild boar. Above the boar is the numeral XII, signifying twelvepence. There is no date.

It is identical in drawing with the crest of Lord Bacon, even to the jaunty curl of its porcine tail. According to the meager records in the British Museum, this coinage was forbidden by James I to be exported. It seems strange that the Hog Money should have been re- garded so unfavorably by the king. Why did James on two separate occasions act so strenuously to prevent the circulation of this coinage? The Encyclopaedia Britannica (1946) intimates that the coins were struck in America, but numismatic catalogues describe them as made for Amer- ica. From the evidence of the coins themselves, it would seem that the Hog Money was a definite landmark, bear- ing witness to the operations of the Secret Society directing the early colonization program. The adventures of Sir George Somers were quickly adapted to high drama by the literary workshop at Gray's Inn. The most obvious example of their ingenuity was The Tempest. This play first appeared about one and a half years after the governor had been shipwrecked. According to the chronological chart of the Shakespearean plays, The Tempest was first acted in 1611, was played a second time in 1613, but was not published until the great folio of 1623. It is supposed that the play was written between 1608 and 1610, but there is no data as to whether or not it was among those rewritten before final publication. The character of Prospero, magician, philosopher, and Duke of Milan, is believed to be based upon a historical person whose name was Prospero Colonna. It is interest- ing that Columbus usually signed himself \"Colon,\" and that Lord Baron has been referred to as \"the little Colum- bus of literature.\" The Tempest also introduces an \"honest old counselor,\" by name Gonzalo, who seems dedicated to a utopian mood. He refers to the magic isle as a \"common-"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"AMERICAJS ASSIGNMENT WITH DESTINY 63 wealth,\" and explains that if he had a plantation there (a term used in describing colonial grants in America) he would design it along communal lines, concluding: \"All things in common Nature should produce Without sweat or endeavor: treason, felony, Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine Would I not have: but Nature should bring forth Of its own kind, all foyzon, all abundance To feed my innocent people.\" The patrons of the Virginia Company included Lord Southampton and those two, that \"incomparable paire,\" William, Earl of Pembroke, and Philip, Earl of Mont- gomery, to whom the first folio of Shakespeare was dedi- cated. These excellent gentlemen also permitted the use of their names as patrons of that company of actors which included William Shakespeare-a tight little corporation, to say the least. So elaborate a plan would not have been necessary had the colonization program involved nothing more than the granting of land to royal favorites. I t makes little practical difference whether the flora and fauna of The Tempest resembles the Bermudas, or as Dr. Hale suggests, corresponds more closely with the Cutty- hunk Island off the coast of Massachusetts. The opponents of the Bermudian hypothesis insist that the play would have mentioned the wild hogs had these islands been the locale of the story. If Bacon and his Society were involved in the project, it would scarcely have been advisable for them to emphasize the hog symbol, which had already been used with discretion on several occasions. They could not afford to tie the Shakespearean productions so obviously with their scheme. They were satisfied to leave their mark and seal on the emblematic coinage.

Thomas Jefferson examined the \"repositories\" of the Bacon group in colonial America, checked their contents, and caused them to be resealed for future ages. Several attempts have been made to locate these \"philosophical tombs,\" including excavations in England, Newfoundland, and Virginia. What is believed to be an important Baconian vault was located, with the help of coded tombstones, in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1938. t After his \"banishment\" from public life, Bacon muses thus upon the philosophical advantages of political decline: \"Methinks they are resembled by those of Sir George Somers, who being bound by his employment to another coast, was by tempest cast upon the Bermudas. And there- fore a ship wrack'd man made full discovery of a new temperate fruitful region, which none had before inhabited; and which Mariners, who had only seen its rocks, had esteemed an inaccessible and enchanted place.\" In his advice to Sir George Villiers, Bacon expressed the same sentiments which had been incorporated in the Broadsides of the Council for Virginia. According to Alexander Brown, \"he may have taken these ideas from those Broad- sides, or he may have been one of the original authors of them, as he was a member of that Council.\"* The same author was so impressed by Bacon's references to \"tempest and the inaccessible and enchanted Bermudas\" tSee Foundations Unearthed, by Marie Bauer. * See Genesis of the United States."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"AMERICA'S ASSIGNMENT WITH DESTINY 65 that he asks: \"May not Bacon have aided Shakespeare in compiling some of his plays? ...

It is not without reason that Lord Bacon, who has been called \"the moving spirit in the colonization scheme,\" included Christopher Columbus as one of the \"great STAMP OF NEWFOUNDLAND Issued to commemorate the tercentenary of the colonization scheme and Lord Bacon, its guiding spirit. inventors.\"* Judge Brown writes of Bacon's participation in the settlement of Newfoundland: \"It was entirely due to the Great Chancellor's influence that the king granted the advances and issued the Charters to Bacon and his associates in Guy's Newfoundland Company.\"t The Colonial State Calendar contains the following extract of patent: \"To Henry, Earl of Northampton, Sir Francis Bacon, and others, for the Colony or plantation in Newfoundland from \"See The New Atlantis. tSee History of Newfoundland."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66 THE ADEPTS 46° to 52° N.

A few fragments will indicate the direction of his thinking: \"In no History of America, in no Life of Bacon, have I found one word to connect him with the plantation of that great Republic. Yet, like Raleigh and Delaware, he takes an active share in the labours, a conspicuous part in the sacrifices through which the foundations of Virginia and the Carolinas are first laid. Like men of far less note, who have received far higher honours in America, Bacon pays his money into the great Company, and takes office in its management as one of the Council. To his other glories therefore must be added that of a Founder of New States .... \"All generous spirits rush to the defense of Virginia. Bacon joins the Company with purse and voice.

James promised to keep the secret with his honor, but hastened to whisper it in the ear of Count Gondomar. The Spanish, properly forewarned, had a strong force waiting for Raleigh at the mouth of the Orinoko, and in the fighting that followed, Raleigh's son was killed. J ames, who was to blame for the whole sorry business, promised Gondomar that Raleigh would be publicly executed, but even the popular account of the knight's death is false. Under such conditions, it would have been madness to preserve the papers of any significant political project. That which was intentionally concealed, even from the records of State, cannot easily be recovered after so long a time. It was an axiom of that day that a wise man was like a trunk with a double bottom-when first opened, the trunk must seem to be empty. Only those of kindred spirit could know that a man's character had a secret compartment. James Spedding, an outstanding authority on Bacon's life, writes: \"We learn incidentally from one of Bacon's apopthegyms that soon after he became Lord Keeper (which would be shortly before Raleigh sailed), he had a long conversation with him in Gray's Inn walks.

The only names of interest which he advanced were the Earl of Northumberland and Ben Jonson.* Bacon visited Raleigh during his imprisonment, and the friendship between the two men was sufficiently founded upon previous efforts which Bacon had made to cement a genuine alliance between Raleigh and the unfortunate Earl of Essex. Ben Jonson acted as intermediary and agent extraordinary on several occasions. It will be re- membered that Jonson was at Stratford on that festive evening which is said to have contributed to the \"Bard's\" demise. If Shakespeare had small Latin and less Greek, it is unlikely that Raleigh had more Hebrew. The first edition of The History of the World is embellished with numerous emblems and devices belonging to the Baconian group. The title page has been a subject of controversy for centuries. Ben Jonson, referring to Sir Walter Raleigh, told Drummond: \"The best wits in England were employed in making his history.\" Bacon became a member of the Virginia Company in 1609. The charters of that year and of 1612, drafted by Sandys, were prepared for the king's signature by Sir Henry Hobart and Sir Francis Bacon. To Bacon's interest in the colonies, testimony is borne by William Strachey in the dedica tion ( dated 1618) of a manuscript copy of his Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britania: \"Your Lordship ever approaving yourself a most noble fautor (favorer) of the Virginia plantation, being from the beginning (with other lords and earles) of the principal counsell applyed \"See Curiosities of Literature."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70 THE ADEPTS to propagate and guide yt.\" One of the reasons why there is so much difficulty in tracing Bacon's activities in con- nection with the plantation is that the records of the Privy Council to the year 1613 were destroyed by fire at White- hall, in 1618. Incidentally, the boundaries of the original Virginia Colony extended to the west coast of California. Charles Mills Gayley divides the group instrumental in the foundation of the Virginia Company of London into two sections: the Liberals, or patriots, and the Imperialists, who supported the king in reserving to the Crown the right to form the government of the colonies and plantations. This conflict was the real source of the Revolution of 1775, which resulted in the complete independence of the Amer- icancolonies. Among the Liberals, Gayley includes Christo- pher Brooke and John Seldon. \"They were both, in their hours of ease, poets after a fashion, members of the pastoral coterie of the Inns of Court .... Brooke's bosom friend was the poet Donne. He was also intimate with Shakespeare's follow 'dramatists, jonson- and Drayton, and his epic dramatic admirer, Davies of Hereford; ... \" . -Gayleyshows the usual systematic indifference to Bacon's part in the colonization plan, and the few references which he makes to his Lordship are consistently derogatory. He does, however, mention that Bacon, in his essay Of. Planta- tion, which was not published until after the great Chan- cellor's death, appeared to agree with the practical phase of the Liberals' policy. Gayley says: \"Bacon may have collaborated with Sandys, but his interest in the colonies was romantic and always for the glorification of the Crown.\" In a speech given at Gray's Inn Hall, an American, the Honorable James Beck, remarked that the two charters of government, which were the beginning of constitutional- ism in America and therefore the germ of the Constitution"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"AMERICAJS ASSIGNMENT WITH DESTINY .71 of the United States, were drawn up by Lord Bacon. He added that Bacon, \"the immortal treasurer of Gray's Inn,\" visioned the future and predicted the growth of America in the memorable words: \"This Kingdom now first in His -From Case's Sphaera Civitatis QUEEN ELIZABETH AS THE PRESIDING GENIUS OF THE SPHERE OF MORAL VIRTUES Majesty's time hath gotten a lot or portion in the New World by the plantation of Virginia and the Summer Islands.

Bacon's words should be carefully studied, for here is a remarkable example of double meaning. He says: \"For, by this unchangeable way (my Lords) have I proposed to erect the Academical Fabric of the Island's Salomon's House, modelled in my New Atlantis. And I can hope (my Lords) that my Midnight Studies to make our Countries flourish and outvy European Neighbors in mysterious and beneficent Arts, have not so ingratefully affected the whole Intellects, that you will delay or resist his Majesty's desires, and my humble Petition in this Benevolent, yea, Magnificent Affair; Since your Honourable Posterities may be enriched thereby, and my Ends are only, to make the World my Heir, and the learned Fathers of my Salomon's House, the successive and sworn Trustees in the dispensation of this great Service, for God's Glory, my Prince's Magnificence, this Parliaments Honour, our Countries general Good, and the propagation of my own Memory ....

Until the formation of the Virginia Company, the J ames- town settlement was a tragic example of shortsightedness and mismanagement. The colonizers were drawn principal- ly from the genteel classes and were totally unequipped to carve out their destinies in the wilderness. Among the early arrivals were jewelers and a perfumer. Several were fortune hunters, and all would have come to a bad end had not Captain John Smith been a rough-and-ready soldier, whose exploits included warfare against the Turks in Transylvania. Among these assorted \"gentles,\" however, there were some with capacities suitable for the transference to the Western Hemisphere of the projects designed by the wits of Gray's Inn. After the Jamestown settlement gained some semblance of order and permanence, descendents of those men who formed the original Baconian Society left England and settled in the colony. It was through them that the Great Plan began to operate in America. There were most fortui- tous marriages between the families of the original custo- dians of the philosophical legacy. From the minglings of the bloods of the Bacons, the Wottons, the Donnes, the Herberts, and the Mores, the Virginia colony derived many of its prominent citizens. Lord Bacon guided the project and probably outlined the program to be followed after his death. The Reverend M. F. Carey, associate of the Philosophical Society of Great Britain, writes: \"We are furnished with no documentary evidence of the introduction of Free- masonry into the United States; but it appears that it had an existence there as early as the year 1606.\"* Charles H.

Someone must have drawn freely from such works as Utopia, Atlantis, Campanella, Shakespeare, the Bible and other sources for the curious conglomeration of Rosicrucian, Religious, Mystic and Operative laws, rules and government that our ritual presents.\"* The Bacon family itself was well-represented in Virginia, both by name and by blood. I t has been usual to trace the Bacons of Virginia from Robert Bacon of Drinkstone, Suffolk, who was the father of the good Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. Sir Nicholas' brother, J ames Bacon, had a son, Sir James Bacon, who died in 1618. Sir James was the father of Nathaniel Bacon (the elder), whose grandson was Nathaniel Bacon, the rebel, who led the Bacon Rebellion in Virginia. Nathaniel, the elder, had a brother, the Reverend James Bacon, whose son, also named Nathaniel Bacon, came to Virginia in1650 and settled at King's Creek in York County. This Nathaniel was a sober and thoughtful man who concerned himself considerably in the affairs of his \"uneasy cousin,\" Nathaniel, the rebel. Both of the Nathaniels have been referred to by historians as Lord Bacon's \"kinsmen.\" The private records do not agree entirely with the accepted genealogy, but this supplies enough material to demonstrate the natural and available channels for the transference of Lord Bacon's projects and remains to Virginia.

He married in 1674, and sailed for Virginia the same year. He had ample financial resources, secured several estates, was social- ly prominent, and was appointed to the Governor's Council. When Governor Berkeley refused to protect the colonists from the neighboring Indian tribes, young Bacon took the field in defiance of the governor's pleasure. A feud approaching revolution resulted, which ended by Nathaniel Bacon and his followers burning the Jamestown settlement. The episode is referred to historically as Bacon's Rebellion, and it has been said that the occurrence played an im- portant part in the formation of the American national consciousness. Bacon's career as a rebel lasted about twenty weeks, and he is supposed to have died of poison or malaria, October 1, 1676, while campaigning. The circumstances of his death are obscure, and his body was buried in. an unmarked grave to prevent Governor Berkeley from order- ing the corpse to be dug up and publicly hanged. There is more to this story than has ever been told. Bacon's Rebellion took place exactly one hundred years before the colonies of America declared themselves to be a free and independent nation, in 1776. The causes of the Rebellion and the Revolution were similar, if not identical. In 1676, Bacon, the rebel, said: \"But if there be (as sure there is) a just God to appeal to, if religion and justice be a sanctuary here, if to plead the cause of the oppressed, if sincerely to aim at his Majesty's honour, and the public good without any reservation or by-interest, if to stand in the gap after so much blood of our dear brethren bought and sold, if after the loss of a great part of his Majesty's colony deserted and dispeopled freely with our lives and estates to save the remainder, be treason-God Almighty judge and let guilty die.\"* 'See Old Virginia and Her Neighbours, by John Fiske."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76 THE ADEPTS Although Bacon, the rebel, was certainly an impetuous young man, his cause was just and his sentiments precisely those of his \"noble kinsman.\" Governor Berkeley repre- sented the same entrenched tyranny against which the Universal Reformation had been fashioned and perfected. In justice, however, it should be noted that Berkeley was summoned to England to explain his conduct. The king refused him audience and is credited with saying: \"That old fool has hanged more men in that naked country than I have done for the murder of my father.\" Berkeley died the following year-of vexation. A.s settlements by the Spanish, Dutch, French, and English increased in number and size, no political, philo- sophical, or mystical sect of Western Europe was without members or sympathizers among the colonizers. Europe was aflame with new ideals affecting every department of human activity. Old World theories became New World practices. Reactionaries and progressives arrived together, but found no substantial reconciliation. Nonconformists continued to be persecuted, and found it necessary to seek refuge in the wilderness or among friendly Indian tribes. Little has been made of these dissentions, and the dissenters themselves have been traditionally regarded as troublesome. It is difficult to restore the pattern of submerged activities covering a period when historical records were scanty and subject to destruction. It is certain, however, that between 1610 and 1660 a mass of material concerned with the development of the Great Plan for America was transferred from Europe to the Western Continent for preservation and future use. It is shallow thinking to assume that the Secret Societies operating in Europe-the Freemasons, the Rosi- crucians, and the Fellows of the Royal Society-had no representation among the colonies until the beginning of the 18th century. The confusion is due, not to the lack"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"AMERICA'S ASSIGNMENT WITH DESTINY 77 of such activity, but to the inadequacy of available records. Reverend Edward Patterson, in his History of Rhode Island (page 101) refers to a Masonic document found in America which says: \"In the spring of 1658, Mordecai Campaunall, Moses Packeckoe, Levi, and others, in all fifteen families, arrived at New Port (America), from Holland. They brought with them the first three degrees of Masonry, and worked them in the house of Campaunall, and continued to do so, they and their successors, to the year 1742.\" Johannes Kelpius and the Pietists of Pennsylvania It has been claimed that the Rosicrucians and possibly other initiate Orders of Europe established themselves in the American Colonies during the closing years of the 17th century. The best publicized candidate for the honor of having brought the Esoteric Schools to the New World was the German theological student and mystical Pietist, Magis- ter Johannes Kelpius. It is believed that Kelpius was initiated into the mysteries of cabalistic philosophy during his university days by the celebrated esotericist, Christian Knorr, Baron von Rosenroth. This learned man edited and translated numerous works relating to obscure subjects, and is especially remembered for his Kabbala Denudata. He was a mystic, and published a collection of hymns under the stimulating title Neuer Helicon Mit Seiner Neun Musen, etc. Kelpius lived for some years as an anchorite in a cave in what is now Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, and died in 1708 as the result of exposure and extreme austerities. The direct cause of his death was tuberculosis. John Kelpius came of a substantial family of Siebenburgen. He was educated in the University of Helmstadt, and regarded Dr. Fabricius, professor of theology at Helmstadt, with special"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78 THE ADEPTS esteem.

Finding this bustling community too world- ly, the group retired into the depths of the lower Wissa- hickon woods where they built a hermitage. Here they formed themselves into the \"Society of the Woman of the Wilderness,\" where they consecrated their efforts toward spiritual preparations for the millennium. The brethren became known as the \"Hermits of the Ridge,\" and com- bined their spiritual ministrations with horoscopy, magic, divination, and healing. Kelpius is credited with laying out the first botanical garden in America. He died sitting in a chair in his garden, surrounded by his sorrowing disciples, in the thirty-fifth year of his life. He was buried in the area, but the location of the grave is not known. His community passed with him, although a few of his celibate followers survived him by many years. Most of the group joined the Mennonite community at Ephrata, and others returned to the simple religious life of the Germantown citizens. The little sect of solitudinarians left little more than a gentle, but eccentric, tradition in the New World. In the library of the Francke Institutions at Halle, in Saxony, there is a manuscript in the autograph of Pastor Heinrich Muhlenberg which describes the death of Kelpius. Feeling that his end was near, the Magister called in his trusted friend, Daniel Geissler. He handed Geissler a small chest or casket securely sealed, and told him to cast it into the Schuylkill River in a place where the water was deep. Geissler carried the curious box to the river bank and decided to hide it there until after the Magister's death. When he returned to the bedside of the dying Kelpius, the Master raised himself on his elbow and rebuked Geissler for disobeying his instructions and concealing the casket. Geissler, convinced that Kelpius had strange powers of"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80 THE ADEPTS second sight, went back and threw the small chest into the water. As it fell into the stream, the sealed box exploded, and for some time flashes of lightning and great roaring sounds came out of the river. Kelp ius, writing in 1699, explained the origin and doc- trines of his Order. The Pietists were conscientious objec- tors to the corruptions existing in organized theologies. Their reforms were accompanied by ecstasies, revelations, inspirations, illuminations, inspeakings, prophecies, appari- tions, changing of minds, transfigurations, translations of bodies, fastings, paradisiacal representations of voices, melodies, and sensations. It is difficult to conceive that the Rosicrucians, as they were known through their original documents, would lay claim to such procedures. Pietism, a 17th-century mystical sect, arose modestly in Frankfort as a spiritual revolt against the intellectual ortho- doxy of German Protestantism. It spread moderately, and the members gained inspiration and comfort from the mystical teachings of Jakob Boehme. Its principal leaders were Philip Jakob Spener and August Hermann Francke. It was Spener who instituted the famous Collegia Pietatis, a kind of meeting of minds for the study of sacred matters. Francke, a Hebrew and Greek scholar, was learned, virtu- ous, and industrious and much admired in the community where he resided. The Pietists held many Puritan convictions, indulged millenarian speculations, and dabbled in mystical arts, and their approach to religious matters is said to have most resembled the devotional concepts of the early Franciscans. The principal emphasis was upon religious experience as the direct means of attaining Christian insight. The Mora- vians are considered a direct offshoot of Pietism, as to a degree was the Methodist revival under John Wesley."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"AMERICA'S ASSIGNMENT WITH DESnNY 81 Although the Pietist communities in Pennsylvania were given to mystical speculation, even to a little cabalism and folk magic, few genuine Rosicrucian landmarks have been discovered among their remains. 'They were religious enthusiasts, and the inner circle was so devout in its prac- tice of continence that it became extinct within fifty years. Magister Kelpius seems to have studied astrology and the metaphysics of Jakob Boehme, and relics relating to these subjects are scattered about the valley of Ephrata. Some of the Pietists gave thought to alchemy, attempted the calculation of the millennium, located water with the divin- ing rod, and wore magical amulets and talismans. They were Second Adventists, and a few believed that they would be translated bodily into the spiritual world without suffer- ing physical death. Dr. Julius Friedrich Sachse was the principal historian of the Germantown communities which flourished in and about Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, during the 18th and early 19th centuries. In his books, The German Pietists of Provincial Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, 1895) and The Diarium of Magister Johannes Kelpius (Lancas- ter, 1917), he attempted to prove that the Kelpius brethren were Rosicrucians. As the original Pietists never claimed such an association, Dr. Sachse based his conclusions upon circumstantial evidence. He advanced seals, signets, ornate symbolic crosses, fragments of mystical rituals, and certain books and manuscripts discovered in the area to support his opinions. These relics, though indicating a devotion to meta- physical speculation, are not sufficiently Rosicrucian in them- selves to justify their acceptance as prima-facie evidence.

Through the courtesy of the daughter of the late Dr. Sachse, it has been possible to examine the Rosicrucian manuscript formerly belonging to him and some other German mystical books which he regarded as indicating Rosicrucian influence. Zimmerman, the astronomer who predicted the end of the world in 1694, was a close friend of Kelpius. Certainly the prophecy was a failure, and it scarcely seems reasonable that the Rosicrucian Brother- hood should move to Pennsylvania, via the good ship Sarah M aria) and there organize themselves out of existence by the extremeness of their vows and religious obligations. On the other hand, it is quite possible that Kelpius was a member of one of the semisecret Adventist movements which had strong followings in Germany and the Low Countries. His manner of life indicates that he was bound by religious obligations, and bound others to himself and the cause which he represented by similar vows. He did not, however, fulfill the requirements set forth in the Mani- festoes of the Rosy Cross, which insisted that members of the Society remain inconspicuous by refraining from any public practices that might draw attention to themselves. Because almost nothing is actually known about the mystical convictions of the Kelpians, their part in the trans- ference of esoteric lore from Europe to America has been considerably exaggerated.

The Pietists could scarcely have been devoted Second Adventists had they any vision of an extensive program for the build- ing of a new social order in the Western Hemisphere, nor did their activities imply any plan for the future or any program for the expansion of the philosophical or mystical aspects of their belief. There is not even the suggestion that Kelpius selected a successor or had any intention of transferring any authority, spiritual or temporal. 'Among the unusual religious groups that settled in Penn- sylvania were the Mennonites, the Labadists, the Dunkers, the Neu-geborenen, the Schwenkfelders, and the Moravian brethren. Most of these sects held convictions that could be interpreted as mystical. In all probability, however, the Rosicrucian descent was established considerably earlier by the English colonials of Virginia. The mystics of the Wissa- hickon, according to the actual words of Ke1pius, shared the convictions and perpetuated the doctrines of the Quiet- ists and Chiliasts, who struggled for existence among the Protestant communities of Germany and Switzerland. The Pietists were channels through which books on cabalism, alchemy, astrology, and the Hermetic arts reached the New World. Thus, they contributed to the westward motion of the Philosophic Empire. Their own practices, however, detracted seriously from their usefulness as re- formers or educators, and their influence was limited to the neighborhood wherein they dwelt. Kelpius was a devout man, possibly well-learned, but most of his followers were more earnest than informed, and there seems to have been no vision among them of a broad or enduring ministry.

This book was the first to attribute the authorship of the Shakespeare plays to Sir Francis Bacon, but that reference, while the best known, is not by any means the most im- portant fragment of the text. Bacon seems to appear per- sonified under the pseudonym \"Wisdom.\" His lordship's departure to Holland is specifically mentioned, and the descent of the Great Plan is traced allegorically from the schools of Greek philosophy through the medieval world to the rise of the Medici, and the account terminates with the crowning of George III as King of England. Beginning on page 224 is the following stimulating remark: \"It was a few Summers ago, that GENIUS, HUMOUR and myself took this same Magistrate along with us to pass some Days at the Foot of a certain Hill called Parnassas, where we have a small Habitation, which we hold of the Ladies of the Manor, who are nine maiden Sisters.\" It would be difficult to ignore this obvious refer- ence to the Lodge of the Nine Sisters and all that it implies. On page 237 of Volume II is a veiled reference to relevant matters: \"The Royal Club or Society (as it is called) founded by Charles Second, was, at first, filled with Men of real Science and Learning.

Wisdom, of course, was Bacon, who originated the entire project of the Royal Society. Between January 21, 1769 and January 21, 1772, an unknown man using the pseudonym of Junius wrote as a man personally outraged. The sins of Parliament weighed heavily upon his soul. He spoke for England, for the Amer- ican colonies, and for the world. He defended the freedom of the press, attacked taxation without representation, and was a vigorous and belligerent champion of human rights. There can be no doubt that his pen advanced the cause of the American Revolution and created sympathy for the victims of bungling English politicians. It is not remark- able that The Letters of Junius gave inspiration and comfort to the cause of American independence. They were widely read in the colonies, and the solid judgment which these Letters contained influenced the thinking of Franklin, J efferson, and Hancock. \"Both liberty and property are precarious,\" writes Junius, \"unless the possessors have sense and spirit enough to defend them. This is not the language of vanity. If I am a vain man, my gratification lies within a narrow circle. I am the sole depository of my own secret, and it shall perish with me.\" Roderick Eagle contributed a curious observation con- cerning a possible association between Junius and the Baconian group.

The obligations of the Mason became his principal allegiances. There was growing resentment in the colonies against the English Crown, and the local administration offended the thoughtful. Dedication to principles gained importance where there were few causes worth supporting. Masonry also successfully bridged many religious differences and discords. The Brethren could practice Christian principles without emphasizing theological differences, thus supply- ing a spiritual horizon necessary to offset the conflict of sects. The second half of the 18th century was marked by broad bun discreet circulation of philosophical knowledge.

It is extremely difficult to trace Franklin's associations with Secret Societies, although such are known to have existed.

Those aware of Franklin's connections with Secret Fraternities will find the following quotation of interest: \"There seems to me at present to be a great occasion for raising a United Party for Virtue, by forming the virtuous and good men of all nations into a regular body, to be governed by suitable, good, and wise rules, which good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in their obedience to, than common people are to common laws. I at present think, that whoever attempts this aright, and is well qualified, cannot fail of pleasing God, and of meeting with success.\" Mutual interests in curiosa and antiquities is said to have inspired the friendship between Franklin and Sir Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society. Franklin also knew Sir William Herschel, and was popular in England in spite of the Revolutionary War. George III consoled himself over the loss of the American colonies because Herschel had recently named a planet in his honor. Franklin was acquainted with Mesmer and Cagliostro, but there is no evidence that he ever met Rousseau. This celebrated French philosopher was living in strict retirement, but he received a copy of Franklin's liturgy for a new religion, with pleasure. Franklin, equally polite, commended the influence of Rousseau's philosophy not only upon the Euro- pean mind, but also among the American colonies. Franklin was in contact with certain obscure gentlemen in the colonies, who took no obvious action in the forma-"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"AMERICA'S ASSIGNMENT WITH DESTINY 91 don of the American government, but were secretly advanc- ing the cause. The Philadelphia printer acted as confi- dential agent for this group on numerous occasions. He traveled about visiting here and there, and delivered mes- sages and reports to interested parties. He was close to the ear of Thomas Jefferson whose attainments were also highly diversified. I t is regrettable that most of Jefferson's library and papers were destroyed when the British army sacked Washington in the War of 1812. Franklin was a link between the European Secret Societies and the American democratic experiment. The following incident is indica- tive of this association. Robert Allen Campbell, in his curious and rare work, OUf Flag, described a meeting which took place in Cam- bridge, Massachusetts, in the fall of 1775. A committee had been appointed to consider a design for a colonial flag. The committeemen were entertained in the home of a patriotic citizen. At that time, a gentleman, whose name was not once mentioned in the reports of the meeting, but was always referred to as \"the Professor,\" was a guest in the house. He later shared his apartment with Dr. Franklin. The Professor was apparently in the prime of life, but referred casually to historical events of the previous century as though he had been present at the time. He carried with him an iron-bound chest filled with rare books and ancient manuscripts. It was noted as remarkable that he was a vegetarian. The Professor was introduced to the committeemen, Messrs. Lynch and Harrison and General Washington, as the group assembled for dinner. When Dr. Franklin was presented, the Professor was especially cordial, and as they shook hands there was \"an instantaneous, a very apparent and a mutually gratified recognition.\" The Professor dominated the meeting, and his recommendations tor the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92 THE ADEPTS colonial flag were immediately accepted.

The register containing this report covered the period of 1775-89, and included such signatures as La Rochefoucauld, Rousseau, and St.-Germain. Lafayette was on terms of some intimacy with the Comte de St.-Germain, and while the Comte con- sidered the young Marquis a rather impetuous youth, they were of one mind on larger issues. Lafayette is a direct link between the political societies of France and the young American government. In The Theosophist (Madras, October 1883) the editor, probably H. P. Blavatsky, commented on an article, \"Adepts and Politics.\" She writes: \"Yet it is as certain though this conviction is merely a personal one, that several Brothers of the Rosy Cross-or 'Rosicrucians,' so-called- did take a prominent part in the American struggle for independence, as much as in the French Revolution during the whole of the past century.

In 1730, Daniel Coxe, of New Jersey, was appointed Provincial Grand Master of the provinces of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania by his Grace, Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, Grand Master of the Premiere Grand Lodge of England. Benjamin Franklin became a Mason in 1731, and was Provisional Grand Master of Pennsylvania in 1734. George Washington took his first degree in the Lodge at Fredericksburg, Virginia, in 1752. The early American Lodges met in taverns or inns, and the first Masonic Temple in America was built in Boston in 1832. It cannot be learned that Thomas Paine was a Mason, although he wrote an essay dealing with the origin of Freemasonry. He attempted to trace the Fra- ternity to the Celtic Druids. Of Masonry, George Wash- ington wrote in 1791: \"Being persuaded a just application of the principles on which Free Masonry is founded, must be promotive of virtue and public prosperity, I shall always be glad to advance the interests of this Society and be con- sidered by them a deserving brother.\"* It is believed that the Boston Tea Party was arranged around a chowder supper at the home of the Bradlee brothers, who were Masons, and that mother Bradlee kept the water hot so that they could wash off the disguises. \"Who were these 'Mohawks,' Sons of Liberty, in paint and gear?\" asks Madison C.

Freemasons among the leaders in the American cause against England included Putnam, Mont- gomery, Wayne, Sullivan, Revere, Lafayette, Koscioszko, Baron de Kalb, and Count Polaski. Robert Morris is also mentioned. The Grand Master of the Masonic Lodges of France at that time was the Duke of Chartres, and the Duchess was the leader of the adoptive Lodge of women Freemasons. The head of another feminine Lodge was Madame Helvetius, Franklin's friend and hostess. The women's Lodge supplied John Paul Jones with funds for a ship. His famous vessel Bon Homme Richard was named in honor of Benjamin Franklin, in whose Poor Richard's Almanac Jones had read the maxim: \"If you would have your business done, go yourself; if not, send.\" The first Continental Congress, on the motion of George Washington, selected Peyton Randolph, Past Grand Master of Masons of Virginia to preside over its deliberations. Later, John Hancock, another Mason, succeeded him. It was Hancock who signed the Declaration of Independence with a signature so bold that \"the King of England could read it without spectacles.\" It is believed that Thomas Jefferson became a Mason in France. Of the fifty-six signers of the Declaration of Independence, nearly fifty were Masons. Only one is known with certainty not to have been a member of the Order.

Frederick Wilhelm August Heinrich Ferdinand, Baron von Steuben, who received the first offer of surrender from Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, was made a Mason in New York State. He had been aide-de-camp to the King of Prussia. Other Masonic leaders included General Nathaniel Green and Major General Henry Knox. All but two of Washington's Brigadier Generals were Masons, as was Ethan Allen of Green Mountain-boy fame. Of the fifty- five members of the Constitutional Convention, all but five were Masons. The Latin American Patriots The early colonization of the Latin American countries was dominated by the Spaniards, and the several colonies which they had established were governed by Spanish vice- roys until the rise of the liberators. It is therefore useful to examine the condition of Secret Societies in Spain during the era of the conquest and the centuries which followed. The fate of Spain and the rapid decline of the power of that country was strongly influenced by the Inquisition. The Inquisition was established in Spain in 1233, but its original sphere of influence was largely confined to the kingdom of Aragon. Ferdinand and Isabella, remembered for their participation in the financing of Columbus, were directly responsible for the promotion of the Inquisitional program. About 1481, the queen brought the Inquisition to Castile, and two years later the notorious Torquemada was named Grand Inquisitor of Spain. For the eighteen years he filled this office, Torquemada averaged ten thousand executions annually.

This convenient term seems to have been applied generously to those intellectuals whose mental horizons had been broadened by the educa- tional institutions which flourished under the Moors. The heretics were the liberals, the progressives, and such as favored the rights of man. The secret association of spies, fanatics, and informers which served the Inquisitional Court were the agents of a determined effort to destroy the philosophers, scholars, and mystics who refused to be con- verted to the prevailing concept of salvation. The zeal and thoroughness of the Inquisitors implied that heretical ten- dencies were strong and that the Church was in a fair way to lose its control over the Spanish conscience. There was an abortive revolution against Charles V in 1520, when he attempted to limit the traditional liberties of his people. The Secret Society which was then led by Padilla was sup- pressed, but not destroyed. It reappeared in 1821 as the Comuneros (the Confederation of. the Communists), a group dedicated to the overthrow of the Spanish monarchy. As this revival coincides closely with the revolutionary out- breaks among the Spanish colonials in America, more than a coincidence may be expected. In 1726, the Grand Lodge of England granted a patent for the establishment of a Masonic Lodge at Gibraltar, and another was founded the following year at Madrid. The Inquisition, which still exercised considerable power, persecuted the Orders so diligently that the Spanish Masons were forced to adopt an elaborate program of secrecy. The Lodges, however, found temporary liberty and considerable opportunity for political activity during the confusion caused by the Napoleonic Wars. Masonry was later again suppressed by Ferdinand VII, so that such Lodges as con- tinued to function concealed their activities under other names. The Grand Orient of Madrid was in secret corre-"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"AMERICA'S ASSIGNMENT WITH DESTINY 99 spondence with those French Lodges which were taking so large a part in the conditioning of the people of France. The Zoroastrian Rite attracted prominent members of the Spanish military, and it was always expedient to have friends in the army. The Brazilian Emperor, Dom Pedro I, was elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Brazil in 1825. Heckethorn notes that the turbulent Republics of South America all had their Masonic Lodges, which were in many cases political clubs in disguise. The Grand Lodge of Mexico was instituted in 1825, but there was Masonic activity in that country prior to that date. The Masonic conviction of liberty, equality, and fraternity must have been attractive to progressive Catholics, for even priests associated them- selves with the Lodges. Many prominent Latin Americans of the period of the revolution were educated in Europe or were in contact with enthusiasts returning to their home- land indoctrinated with the means and ends of the French Revolutionists. With Secret Societies intensely active in Spain and Portugal, many royalists, though faithful children of the Church, privately associated themselves with concepts of liberalism which excited the imagination and appealed to the instinct of the adventurous. This drift of esoteric traditions from Spain was openly acknowledged during the Napoleonic Era, and, though later suppressed in the larger centers of population, continued to inflame afflicted classes in the Spanish colonies. Historical references, however, are meager due to the Inquisition, and even the heroes were reluctant to commit themselves to membership in organiza- tions regarded as highly subversive by the Holy Office.

These factors, though of slight interest to the literal historian, have fascination for the political psychologist. There are per- sistent reports that the Secret Societies of the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas continued long after the conquest, guarded by those reticent aborigines who refused to re- nounce their ancient cultural institutions. Although it may be difficult to trace the rumors, there are elusive reports identifying most of the political reform- ers of the Latin American countries with the Fraternities and Societies of the Indian tribes. Benito Juarez was suspected of such affiliations, and the followers of Pancho Villa were outspoken on this subject. There are vast areas still comparatively unexplored south of the Rio Grande. The primitive religions are powerful in these regions; and wherever the old faiths survive, the esoteric doctrine is served and protected and the occult arts are cultivated. Simon Bolivar In the case of Simon Bolivar (1783-1830) is exemplified the effect of direct contact with the European Secret Societies. From his political prophecies, it is evident that Bolivar was not only a brilliant statesman, but also an intellectual liberal. He read extensively, and his favorite authors were Rousseau, Montesquieu, Hobbes, Helvetius, Holbach, Hume, and Spinoza.

Though a devout Catholic, he was one of those Latin American heroes who refused to accept the reactionary tendencies of his Church. Bolivar witnessed the coronation of Napoleon, but was less impressed by the imperial crown than by the tremen- dous personal influence which Bonaparte exercised over his followers. While in France and Italy, the Liberator con- tacted the various groups that were working quietly but relentlessly to accomplish the freedom of the human mind. The democratic ideology converted him completely, as is proved by his vow at Rome. On the occasion, Bolivar and his tutor, Simon Rodriguez, stood on the summit of the holy hill. Suddenly the young man fell on his knees and addressing Rodriguez, cried out: \"I swear before you, I swear by the God of my forefathers, I swear by my fore- fathers, I swear by my native country, that I shall never allow my hands to be idle nor my soul to rest until I have broken the shackles which chain us to Spain.\" It was during his European travel that Bolivar joined the Masonic Order. Michael Vaucaire dramatizes the Masonic associations of the young man by an episode which occurred while Bolivar was in his stateroom at sea: \"Bolivar came across his Freemason's diploma. He unrolled the great printed sheet, which showed a curtain hanging in an antique temple. It bore the different symbols, level, trowel, square, compass, the three points and the mallet, also crouching sphinxes. Bolivar recalled his introduction to the Lodge at Cadiz, whither he had been drawn by curiosity rather than conviction. He had taken oath to accept no legitimate government in his country save one elected by the full vote of the people, and, to strive with all his might to establish a republican system.\"* Later, in Paris, Bolivar was raised to Master in the Lodge of the Nine Sisters.

The stepson of George Washington sent to Bolivar, through Brother Lafayette, a miniature and GENERAL SIMON BOLlVAR medallion including a lock of Washington's hair as a token of esteem. But if General Bolivar enjoyed the sympathy of those who loved freedom, he also suffered deeply and cruelly for his convictions, like most who have served un- selfishly to liberate their fellow men.

The Masonic memberships of certain key-figures involved in the Mexican struggle for independence should not be accepted as proof that these men were directly associated with eso- teric organizations. The condition of Freemasonry at the time, however, and its place in the descent of the Great Plan for liberty, equality, and fraternity constitutes a tangible link between the Secret Schools of the ancient world with their moral and ethical convictions and the cause of human enlightenment which was so strongly championed by the great Mexican patriot.

Miguel Hidalgo, called the Father of Mexican independence, was ordained to the priesthood in 1778, and from that time on was in frequent difficulties with his religious superiors. Though of slight stature and humble appearance, Hidalgo had improved his years at the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico. He early showed an inclination for history and political science. Even as a young man, he dedicated his life to the emancipa- tion of the Mexican people, especially the Indians. He favored the writings of the French rationalists, particularly the theories of Rousseau and Voltaire, as these applied to the rights of man. He was denounced to the Inquisition at Valladolid for unorthodoxy. He was accused of reading prohibited books and of favoring J ansenism. It was par- ticularly pointed out that he carried with him in his wander- ings a copy of the Koran. Concerning the researches of the Inquisition, Arthur Howard Noll writes: \"In the meantime the Holy Office had pursued an investigation by its usual methods, and had discovered that Hidalgo was developing revolutionary ten- dencies; that he was accustomed to speak of monarchs as tyrants, and that he cherished aspirations for political liberty. He had little respect for the Index Expurgatorius, and was so extensively read in current French literature that he had become thoroughly imbued with French ideas, or, as it was subsequently called, he was afrancesado. He had, by the direct evidence of thirteen witnesses sighted before the tribunal, been guilty of heretical utterances, sufficient to consign him to the stake.\"* The officers of the Inquisition, however, admitted that there were some doubts on certain points, and to the amaze\": ment of Hidalgo himself the case against him was suspended and the evidence filed for future reference. It was referred 'See The Life and Times of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"AMERICA'S ASSIGNMENT WITH DESTINY 105 to in due time. The principal heresy concerned Hidalgo's program for the economic and social improvement of the Indians and mestizos. He was ultimately deprived of his benefice, and by his forty-seventh year was completely dedicated to the liberation of his people from foreign tyranny and domestic oppression. Of special interest was the sudden development through- out the provinces of what were called social and literary clubs. These sprang up rapidly, but no satisfactory history of their origin or the persons responsible for the idea are available. In some way, these groups eluded the Holy Office, and from their inception were dedicated to the same ends that dominated similar Secret Societies in Europe. In 1808, Hidalgo joined one of these clubs in Queretaro, immediately became its principel leader, and extended his influence through this chain of available organizations, This circumstance probably explains the well-authenticated report that Hidalgo became a member of a Masonic Fra- ternity in middle life despite the edicts of the Vatican. Gould, in his Military Lodges, stated positively that Jose Maria Morelos, another priest devoted to the cause of Hidalgo, was a Mason. He was also executed as an \"unconfessed heretic.\" It was in one of these clubs that Hidalgo met Ignatio Allende, who later became the military genius of the revolution. The appearance of a network of Societies dedicated to the private conviction of political liberty may well witness a contact between European groups and the New World. Conditions in Spain were such as to justify a discreet program of organizations in Mexico. Hidalgo's revolution was short-lived and his career as a leader of rebellion lasted only one year. Allende was executed on the 26th of June 1811. Hidalgo was first degraded by the ecclesiastical court and then turned over to the civil courts.

He met death heroically, and his last words were a prayer that heaven would favor the independence of his people. Although Hidalgo's name is revered throughout Mexico, little has been written about him which is available to his countrymen. The details of his career probably have been considered inflamatory and contrary to the present interests of the Church and State. Benito Pablo juarez On the 21st of March, in a little Zapotecan Indian village of some twenty families, was born Benito Juarez (1806- 1872), the emancipator of Mexico. He had no memory of his parents who died during his infancy, but, after numerous difficulties, succeeded in educating himself in law and became deeply involved in the political problems of his country. The policies of Juarez were brought to the attention of the United States by the London correspondent of the New York Tribune, an international exile by the name of Karl Marx. Juarez has been described as an agnostic, but a careful consideration of his attitudes reveals, not a rebellion against God but against the theological institutions which burdened the people of Mexico. This silent, inscrutable Indian belonged to a race moved inward- ly by powerful convictions, but outwardly impassive. His God was the Father of Freedom, served by a priesthood of liberators. Juarez became a Mason in his youth. After the over- throw of the Maximilian Empire, Mexican Freemasonry was consolidated in 1868, Benito Juarez being one of its highest officials.

Ignacio Comonfort, also a member of the Fraternity, was Secretary of War under President Alvarez and later was acting President of the Republic. He took an active part against the French in- vasion, but was killed by bandits or irregular troops in 1863. General Porfirio Diaz was an early supporter of Juarez, under whose influence he became a member of the Masonic Fraternity. He attained the 33° and was Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of Mexico for many years. He was succeeded by his friend, General Manuel Gonzales, 33°, in 1880. Diaz was elected President in 1884 and remained in office until his resignation in 1911. General Mariano Escobedo, a close friend of Juarez and Diaz, was also a Mason and a member of the Supreme Council of Mexico.'] Recent M ystical Movements The recent activities of the older Secret Societies, with one or two notable exceptions, is difficult to trace. Numer- ous Orders, Fraternities, Societies, and cults have come into existence, many claiming an honorable antiquity, but few in a position to prove their claims to those of scholarly inclination. These recent movements may be broadly con- sidered as revivals of old learning, but when their preten- sions are seriously investigated, the findings are inconclu- sive.

Even the most sincere efforts to clarify the situation would result in unfortunate ani- mosities. Those addicted to the numerous sects are general- ly more devout than analytical, and nothing would be gained by offending the devotees of any religious persuasion. The difficulty of tracing historical descents is also in- creased by the innumerable divisions which arose in the American religious life. The rise of science undermined the larger institutions of theology and induced thoughtful persons to seek spiritual consolation in movements offering broader and deeper interpretations of rituals and dogmas. As the demand increased, the supply correspondingly en- larged until the boundaries of orthodoxy lost definition. The 19th-century intellectual became a freethinker, con- vinced that his own judgment was superior to that of the clergy. The freethinker was neither an agnostic nor an atheist; he was a liberal, convinced that freedom included the privilege of questioning authority, both sacred and profane. Emancipation, however, was a mixed blessing. It was one thing to escape old superstitions, and quite another thing to be wise enough not to fall into new errors. Many beliefs that flourished for a time were slight improve- ments, but had the virtue of being different, if not better. As may be expected, there was a luxurious growth of absurd notions. They flourished upon the prevailing ignorance, but having no roots in good soil, these parasitical cults were fascinating but ineffective. The more bizarre were short-lived or survived only at the expense of the credulous.

The theory of freedom could be preserved by Secret Societies, but the practice of freedom required the co- operation of an enlightened people dedicated to a lofty ethical standard. When evaluating the esoteric groups of this period, the most reliable guide is their acceptance of the responsibility of the Great Plan. Progress is not ordinarily for the advancement of the individual, but for the unfoldment of the universal project. The real Esoteric Schools still labor toward the goal of the World Commonwealth. The Plan remains utopian, and the disciple advancing through the grades of a legitimate initiate-system is being prepared, not for personal emancipation, but as an instrument for the liberation of his fellow men. Wherever religious induce- ments are personal and selfish or the devotee is encouraged to advance his own growth without consideration for others, there is something wrong with the policy of the sect. Yet, the literature of modern metaphysical movements seldom emphasizes growth as responsibility. The reader is encour- aged to study mystical systems or to affiliate with organiza- tions claiming extraordinary knowledge in the hope that he will acquire the skill to advance his own condition. Where such objectives are used to intrigue the gullible, those of sincere mind and heart are entitled to reservations. The old Secret Societies remain as they had always been, custodians of an overconviction. They are now emphasiz- ing the right use of privileges. Education can be conferred by schools and universities, but enlightenment must still result from internal growth.

Progress of society always demands that the human being as a person be in advance of the institutions which he creates.

This is not the Plan, and if the condition continues uncorrected, phys- ical society will collapse upon the individual, burying him beneath the debris of his own productions. With the rise of materialism, the Secret Societies were concealed from the profane, not by any elaborate machinery of their own, but by popular disbelief. There was no place for sacred institutions in minds already dedicated to scien- tific skepticism. The importance of invisible principles over visible purposes and ambitions was simply ignored. Only that small minority which remained true to a higher standard of values continued to be concerned with inevi- table outcome. For the majority, the physical world with its wonders was sufficient to absorb all available time and interest. The result is obvious. The physical state of man enlarged, and his ethical horizons were appropriately narrowed. The old adversaries were gone. The power of the Church and State to plague the destiny of the average man was broken. I t was no longer needful to struggle against the despotism of feudalism or the perversities of princes. The Inquisition had lost its terror, and theology was unable to impose its traditional formulas upon a down-trodden laity. But the ills that men must bear changed their appear- ances, not their substance. The authority of science took the place left vacant by the departing authorities of aris- tocracy and theology. It was still necessary for the human spirit to struggle against the intolerances of the human mind. Personal ambitions, liberated by the new code of freedom, immediately began to dream of supremacy. A vast con- cept, highly competitive in principle and highly destructive in practice, perpetuated most of the instruments of the old tyranny.

THE GREAT SEAL Professor Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard described the design thus: \"The device adopted by' Congress is practically incapable of effective treatment; it can hardly (however artistically treated by the designer) look otherwise than as a dull emblem of a Masonic fraternity.\" This is one of the important esoteric landmarks that have been conveniently ignored. It is evident that the continued operations of the genuine Secret Societies make it unwise to describe them or identify their members. Humanity has not yet reached a state of collective security in which leadership beyond the political sphere is unnecessary. The need for guidance actually in- creases with the complexity of mundane affairs. All of sincere heart find consolation in the conviction that powers beyond and above human corruption continue to administer the destiny of the globe. It would be a mistake to confuse this governing body with the various sects which pretend to authority, but give no indications or proof that they can manage efficiently even their own affairs."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112 THE ADEPTS Those sensitive to subtle values will find positive indica- tions of fortuitous intervention if they care to see., for them. The landmarks are not obvious to the profane, but years of familiarity with the proportions of the project enable the thoughtful to recognize the systematic unfold- ment of the Great Plan. The truth is more obvious among those peoples whose religions acknowledge the existence of an invisible government. This has always been concealed in the descent of the Western Mystery religion. Once Christianity had rejected paganism, it refused to recognize the Esoteric Orders of the pre-Christian world. It regarded them as detrimental to its own prestige, and sought relentlessly to exterminate them. This was im- possible, but the Church refused to accept and to teach a universal religion or a universal philosophy. The spiritual mysteries of life belong to no one faith, race, or school. In order to advance itself as the supreme custodian of salvation, ecclesiasticism had to reject the Mystery system. In doing so, it did not destroy that system, but forfeited its own place as an instrument for the fulfillment of the Great Plan. In its effort to usurp this high destiny for itself, the Church obscured the very essentials of human progress and discouraged its followers from those noble and unselfish convictions which might long ago have supplied the incentives for a Universal Reformation of mankind. When legitimate authority passed from the Church to the Orders of the Quest, this secret ecclesia drew to itself those who truly loved mankind. Even with the passing of centuries, the rift has not been mended. Theological groups still emphasize a personal salvation achieved by miraculous means. In this case, the very word miraculous stands for the rejected esoteric tradition. It is the undefined and, for the theological, undefinable science of human regeneration. It is not sufficient to say that beyond the Church is only"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"AMERICA'S ASSIGNMENT WITH DESTINY 113 the unknown sphere of God. Actually, beyond the Church are the Mysteries, guarded by the shepherds of men. There is nothing that can limit the merit of present action more completely than lack of vision about accumulative con- sequences of action. Humanity can release itself from defeatism only when the true proportions of the Great Plan are at least partly perceived. The lack of the realization of high purpose contributes to the cultivation of less desir- able motives and inclinations. The Secret Societies are now engaged upon a broad reformation of the world-educational concept. The great universities and schools must fulfill the destiny which con- ceived them and sustained them through long and troublous times. Humanity cannot be preserved by the three \"R's,\" unless the universal truths locked within the forms of the arts and sciences are released. Just as mysticism once opened and revealed the secrets of religion, so it must now open and reveal the secrets of the sciences. Forms must give up the spirits locked within them, otherwise the seeds cannot grow and bear their proper fruit. The great tree, which is knowledge, with its twelve branches, is for the healing of the nations. Who shall say that it has revealed the fullness of its benefits? The forces opposing the essential progress of humanity are always embodiments of the three great enemies: ignorance, superstition, and fear. As man advances in his collective evolution, these negative obstacles supply a necessary incentive for individual improvement toward collective security. Ignorance is the state of insufficient knowledge. The concept is relative, but sufficient knowl- edge is that which is superior to whatever circumstances may prevail. Superstition is addiction to that which is untrue. The prevailing superstition is the acceptance of materialism, an acceptance which is indefensible and un-"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"114 THE ADEPTS demonstrable. Fear is man's anxiety over the consequences of his own actions, becoming the victim of the collective conduct of his own kind. Until every possible interpreta- tion of the qualities of the three adversaries have been ex- hausted, the work of human enlightenment must continue. In each generation, the adept-teacher must be out of sympathy with the prevailing abuses .. He must always oppose entrenched corruption and strive against what has been called the static of masses. Human behavior cor- rupted by false doctrines resents its own benefactors. The Secret Societies are champions of progress through con- structive change, but men fear change and doubt progress. Destiny, however, conspires against the permanence of in- sufficient institutions. Growth is natural to the wise, and inevitable for the foolish. Conditions beyond human con- trol are forever breaking down the limitations which man has placed upon his own future. Destiny and the Mysteries must win, for they are on the side of the Great Plan. As that which is necessary always provides the means for supplying its own necessity, the human state proves the esoteric tradition. It is not conceivable that there should be laws in space for which there are no channels of release in human society. Truth always comes to man through man. The great initiate-teachers have offered their own souls as channels for the distribution of cosmic truths. These teachers are not only unselfish, they are also adequate for the ministry which is their chosen task. Through long periods of discipleship, they have become learned in states- craft, in law, medicine, art, literature, and science. In their natures, philosophy and mysticism have been unfolded far beyond the understanding of the profane. Obviously, the Great Schools, functioning through their trained and ap- pointed messengers, constitute the highest leadership avail- able to man or required by man. In order, however, that"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"AMERICA'S ASSIGNMENT WITH DESTINY 115 their work be accomplished it is not sufficient that they have the needed vision. This vision must be communicated. It must be extended throughout human society until humanity redeems itself by the experience of enlighten- ment. The security that the world seeks cannot be bestowed; it must be earned. When a sufficient number has attained this degree of true leadership, the imperishable democracy of the sages will become a fact in the mortal sphere. The genuine Esoteric Associations always required that disciples prepare themselves for careers of practical service. The student was expected to attain to a state of unusual skill or proficiency in some branch of learning. He was then to practice this profession or craft as a means of ex- tending his sphere of constructive influence. He was to teach through example, enriching his chosen vocation with the overtones of enlightened religious philosophy. Thus, gradually creating a significant zone of influence, he was available for whatever task the Keepers of the Great Plan required. Practical ends can only be achieved by practical means, and the agents of the Universal Reformation must be sufficient for every emergency. Rather than attempt to indicate modern organizations which mayor may not be instruments of the Mystery sys- tem, it is more useful to recommend that each truth seeker make use of his own faculties of discrimination. The Esoteric Orders have never accepted candidates without reasonable qualifications, nor have they offered any inducements except the privilege of becoming unselfish, useful, and humble. They have never promised to gratify the whims of mortals, and have reserved the right to select in their own way those whom they believed to have the courage, the insight, and the fortitude which the magnitude of the project demanded. Human society cannot be preserved by Fraternities of the unfit, even though the members be well-intentioned.

Those aspiring to become initiate-teachers must discipline and improve their abilities before their candidacy can be considered. Those initiates of the Western descent whose names are known convey a fair impression of acceptable qualifications. Such men as Roger Bacon, Francis of Assisi, Dante, Para- celsus, Basil Valentine, Robert Fludd, Francis Bacon, and St.-Germain immediately recall the remarkable abilities, the wonderful devotion, and the enduring fortitude of those -From an l Sth-century Hermetic Book A SYMBOLICAL PRINTER'S DEVICE This vignette is a pictorial signature of the Secret Societies of Liberty. who resolved to devote their lives to the improvement of mankind. Quiet thinking will dissolve all doubts as to the genuine teachings of the Mystery Schools and the qual- ifications necessary to membership. Usually, the Schools selected their disciples, imposing upon them rules of dis- crimination and discretion, so that no matter of importance was entrusted to anyone still plagued by his own ambitions or likely to succumb to the temptations of worldly acclaim. The principal test of existing religious and mystical organizations is, therefore, their practical acceptance of"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"AMERICA'S ASSIGNMENT WITH DESTINY 117 collective responsibility. If the group is concerned pri- marily with the perpetuation of its own abstract doctrines and has provided no means for the direct application of these doctrines for the advancement of all men, something is wrong. Wisdom is not destined for the few. Certainly, it must be given to a few, that through them it may be taught to the many. Any group which imposes artificial limitations of prejudice, bigotry, or intellectual exclusive- ness frustrates the legitimate program of universal enlighten- ment. No one religion, philosophy, sect, or creed will ever be the sole custodian of the esoteric tradition. Organiza- tions pretending to provide the \"only hope of salvation\" can be immediately discarded. The Great Plan has taken on innumerable appearances that meet the requirements of human evolution, but the Plan itself is beyond all appear- ances. Many have the privilege of serving, but only the divine wisdom itself has the authority to dogmatize, and it has never indulged that prerogative. The design is not difficult to visualize if the mind and heart are properly receptive. The religions, philosophies, sciences, and arts of mankind are all ensouled organisms. They grow up in the world, like flowers in a field, all nourished by the same light and moisture. It profits nothing to argue as to which of these flowers is the fairest or which is the most likely to survive, nor is it more practical to debate such issues as which shrub was predestined to govern the others. All are channels for the one life, which alone determines the fulfillment of the processes of growth. The separate organisms of learning must finally come together to form one vast organization. If one part be lacking, the body will be imperfect. Who shall say in a magnificent association of this kind that any of the fragments which form the perfect whole is unessential?

The Great League is the fruit of the Great Plan. Once the body of knowledge has been ordered by the canons of esoteric architecture, it becomes one vast sanctuary. It is the temple built with- out hands-the Everlasting House. Into this body the: Great Plan incarnates, so that the form itself, built by men through love and consecration, is ensouled with the irn- mortal light of the Mystery tradition. There are two motions in human society. One is toward understanding) and this is the unifying force. The other motion is toward misunderstanding) and this is the dividing force. Each human being advances the universal destiny to the degree that he overcomes within himself the impulses to divide and separate. It is not always possible to defend the conduct of groups or individuals or to co-operate with that which is obviously perverse. Too often, however, division is due simply to prejudice or to those egocentric impulses which tend to isolation through a false conviction of personal superiority. All institutions, sacred and secular, are composed of human beings. As these grow and unfold their natural consciousness, they verge toward each other by simple convictions of fraternity. Every possible effort should be made to encourage good feeling between sincere persons of different beliefs. This is only possible when all are generous and find justification in the realization of -the pressing need of united effort. The pages of history reveal the irresistible unifying force operating in human affairs. The story of man is the record of the struggle upward and forward from isolation to unifi- cation. No one can go against this motion without betray- ing himself, his world, and his God.

It is recommended that the sincere truth seeker examine the various organizations which have risen in human society, and determine by their works rather than by their pretensions which ones are dedicated to the advancement of World Fraternity. Such associations\" whether they be actual instruments of the Secret Schools or simply groups of sincere persons, are laboring in the light and for the light. Once convinced of the reality of the Great Plan, the individual also receives a vision of realities which enable him to conduct his own affairs in harmony with the larger destiny. The esoteric tradition, first embodied in its adepts and later incarnated in the whole body of humankind, brings the kingdom of heaven to the earth. A regenerated human society, unfolding under the disciples of the Mysteries, fashions the Eternal City, which bears witness to the laws of heaven. Who shall deny that this vision of things possible to man is the noblest and most wonderful of human dreams? And who shall deny that man has within himself the power to make his dreams come true? Progress builds solid foundations under dreams. The trestle board of the Mysteries is the divine dream for humanity. The Mystery Schools were the sacred colleges, and the first graduates of those secret institutions were the adept- builders. These initiate-builders were skilled in the arts and sciences required to transform the dream of universal brotherhood into the temporal fact of the divine common- wealth.
