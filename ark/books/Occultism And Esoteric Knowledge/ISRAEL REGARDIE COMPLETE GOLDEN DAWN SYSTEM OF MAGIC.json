For awhile it created a good deal of anxiety simply bec ause it appeared to me that there should be some degree of coincidence between student and system. It was not until many years afterwards that I came to be aware of the function of therapy. At that time I had some dear friends who had amongst their acquaintances some psychotherapists in London where I then resided. Some of them I met socially w hen we discussed this particular problem that was haunting me. A few agreed with me that there was on ly one remedy for this discrepancy and that was to enter therapy as a patient. I did this, remainin g in therapy for several years and I must say it be nefited me enormously. Even today, three or four decades la ter I still get an occasional letter from a student here, there and anywhere making the statement that I seem to be one of the few sane writers on the subject. True or not, they perceive that there is a difference in one who has had therapy and another who has not. Today therefore I am adamant both to correspondents and visitors alike that to obtain the greatest benefit from Magic which is as it were a p ost-graduate study there should be some undergraduate work in a personal therapy. The divid ends are enormous. For a long while it seemed to me that Jungian thera py provided the answer to this problem. However from time to time I would meet or hear from a correspondent who"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 2 co mplained that that form of therap y was li ke Ain S oph, without e nd.

It claimed to be \"an Hermetic Society whose members ar e taught the principles of occult science and the Magic o f Her mes. Durin g the e arly p art of the last century, se veral pro minent Adepti and Chiefs of the Order in France and England died, and their death caused a temporary dormant condition of Temple work .\" It goes on to state that these adepts \"received indeed and have handed down to us their d octrine and system of Theosophy and Hermetic Science and the higher Alchemy from a long series of practical investigators whose origin is traced to the Fratres Roseae Crucis of Ge rmany, which association was founded by one Christian Ro se n kreu t z ab ou t t he year 1 39 8 A. D.. . \"T he Rosicrucian revival of Mysticism was but a new development of the vastly older wisdom of the Qabalistic Rabbis and of that v ery ancient secret knowledge, the Magic of the Egyptians, in which the Hebrew Pentateuch te lls you that Moses. the founder of the J e wis h s yst e m, wa s `l ea rne d ', t hat is , in whi ch he had b ee n i niti ate d.\" This is the Golden Dawn historical claim. Many have questioned its veracity. That really does not concern us at this moment. Perhaps by far the best and most objective account of its history, short and concise, was writ ten by Aleister Crowley in Liher LXI vel Causae. The first fe w pa ra grap hs ar e so well stat ed a s t o w arra nt q uotat io n her e: \"Some years ago a number of cipher MSS. were discov ered and deciphered by certain students. They attracted much attention, as they purported to derive from the Rosicrucians.

It was writte n by one of them that S. D. A.'s scheme had always been regarded with disapproval. But sinc e the absolute rule of the adepts is never to interfere with the judgments of any other person whomsoever -- how much more, then, one o f t he ms el ves , an d tha t o ne most hi ghl y r e ve red ! -- t he y ha d refr ain ed fro m a cti ve o p posi tio n.

W. Westcott, in which it is stated that \"In 1887 by the permission of S.D.A., a continental Rosicrucian Adept, the Isis-Urania Temple of Hermet ic students of the Golden Dawn was formed to give instructions in the mediaeval occult sciences. Fratres M.E.V. with S.A. and S.R.M.D. became the Chiefs, and the latter wrote th e rituals in modern English from old"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 4 Rosicrucian manuscripts (the property of S.A.) supp lemented by his own literary researches.\" T hese several statements then give the beginning of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Since its inception in the last quarte r of the nineteenth century it has exerted far greater influence on the growth and disseminati on of practical occult information and knowledge than can be realized by most present day students. At first its membership was recruited from a broad spectrum of English intellec tuals and artists and even the clergy, but later came to include quite ordinary men and women from every segment of society and life. I n accord with the spirit of the times, it cloaked itself in a glamour of mystery and secrecy. Regardless of the various rumors that circ ulated about it, it came to be very difficult to join this Order. Even A. E. Waite, who some rega rd as an occult authority, sarcastically remarked in his autobiography that his first applic ation was black-balled. It was after a period of time that he reapplied at the urging of s ome of his friends and only then was he accepted. Its teachings and methods of instruction were surro unded by oaths and various penalties attached to the most awe inspiring ritual -obligations to ensure secrecy. You will see what these are in various rituals that are given in the body of the text. It is now common knowledge that Arthur Machen, Florence Farr, W. B. Yeats, Algernon Blackwood, Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, and A. E. Waite -- to mentio n only a few -- were members of this prestigious organisation. It should be self-evident then that some of its me mbers were not the usual flakey nit-wits some critics are disposed to believe, but prominent and intelligent people. Perhaps some attention should be given to the secul ar names of some of those whose Order mottoes have been given above. Sapere Aude an d Non Omnis Moriar were the mottoes chosen by Dr. William W. Westcott, a London physician and a coroner by occupation. M.E.V., or Magnum est Veritas was the m otto of Dr. William R. Woodman, an eminent Freemason of the last century, who died in 1891 very shortly after the Order was founded and therefore did not play much of active r ole in its governance. S.R.M.D. or S. Rhiogail Ma Dhream, the motto of Samuel Liddell Mat hers also known as McGregor Mathers, was the most active of the chiefs of the O rder. He also used the motto Deo Duce Comite Ferro. He has been described at some length in a biographical study The Sword of Wisdom by Ithel Colquhoun, well worth reading in this conn ection. Westcott was the author of a couple of minor little books and the editor of an hermetic and alchemical series of writings, well pr ized today. He was prominent in certain Masonic circles of his day. Mathers was the translator of three mediaeval magic al texts. The Greater Ker of King Solomon, The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, and The Kaballah Unveiled (which consisted of certain portions from Knorr von Rosenr oth's Latin rendition of parts of the Zohar -- more distinguished however by a relatively long introduction of"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"VOLUME ONE 5 considerable erudition and which well warrants re-p ublication by itself as an introduction t o t he stu dy o f the Qa bal ah .) In this connection I wo uld like to reco mme nd The Rosy Cross Unveiled by Christopher McIntosh, which purports to give a hist ory, mythology and the rituals of an occult order ( pu blis he d b y Aqu ari an Pr es s Ltd . 1 9 80 ) . In as much as both Mathers and Westcott had dual mo ttoes, it should be remarked that one was for use in the Outer Order of the Gold en Dawn, the other being reserved of the In n e r Or der of t he R.

In addition to tracing some of the obscurities relating to the origins of the Order, it provides a bird's eye view of its teachin gs that might be of value to the current r ead er .

Each religious mysticis m cross fertilized the other in a magnificent manner. All of these trends, and they were powerful each in its own specific way, contributed to a body of esoteric knowledge and experience that was pecul iarly Western. It may have had numberless resemblances to the traditions extant in the East, but they also had their own individual differences that characterized it as a system wholly apart from its Eastern counterpart. It is this that today we call the Western esoteric tradition. It has reared its head in different times and places and in different ways . On many occasions it may seem to have been wiped out a nd disappeared from the face of the earth. But always it seemed to reappear revivified by its abse nce, spreading wider and wider, influencing more and more people, leavening always the institutions most hostile to its continued existence. From time to time, organizations were formed here a nd there as means of perpetuating the hidden Hermetic knowledge. The Order of the Golden Dawn was another of these Orders which sprang up, using the wisdom of prior ages, exclusiv ely western knowledge, in order to initiate mankind into a higher level of psycho-spiritual functioning . Parallel to all of this, there is a concurrent \"leg end \" or statement of fact that there is a hidden Order, whether on the inner spiritual planes or her e on the mundane level where most of us live, of Adepts and enlightened beings who watch over mankin d and its travails. They seek to further the evolution of mankind without interfering with the apparent free choice of human beings to determine their own destiny either towards personal destructi on or the attainment of communion with God. From time to time, it is said, these beings permit or di rect the appearance of an external organization suc h as we have previously described. It is also believe d that periodically, either towards the end of a ce ntury or in some historical crisis, one of them makes a p ublic appearance in one guise or another in order n ot merely to ward off wholesale disaster but to guide some few or many in a new creative direction. They also are the embodiments of the Western Esoter ic Traditions, and rather than an external organization, are the custodians of its teachings. SELF INITIATION By V.H. FRATER A.M.A.G. The Neophyte Ritual and that of the Adeptus Minor G rade are the most important and effective rituals of the Order. Those in between ar e the so-called elemental rituals. Crowley took a rather dim view of these. Francis King assumed wron gly that I also held much the same attitude. In fact, however, I think that they have a very defini te place in the entire"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"VOLUME ONE 9 process of initiation. That they are verbose and ov erlong I will admit to. Nonetheless there are ways and means of overcoming this problem. In my re cently published book Ceremonial Magic (Aquarian Press, England) a ritual opening that I c alled Opening by Watchtower (first demonstrated in the consecration ceremony of the Vault of the Ad epts) could be elaborated meaningfully in a variety of different ways which could be construed as effective as abbreviated elemental initiations. To be concise, an elemental initiation is one in wh ich the elementals are invoked in such a way that they affect the sphere of sensation or the ene rgy field of the candidate. A series of impressions or symbols are impressed on this energy field in such a way that they act, for the candidate, as a kind o f passport providing safe entry and freedom of moveme nt in that elemental sphere of operation. Assuming that this is the case, then the four eleme ntal grade initiations of the Outer Order, in reality do little more than the abbreviated Opening by Watchtower ceremonies. A number of advantages flow from this assumption. The first is that the ritual is nowhere as turgid, lengthy and tiresome as is the grade ritual, all criticisms whi ch led Crowley and others to the faulty conclusion that they could be dispensed with as useless. The second , and I think the most important one, is that the Watchtower rituals described in the book named abov e could be employed as self-initiatory rituals. Again, assuming that this is factual, then we have reached a stage which fulfills the original promise of some of my early writing on the Golden D awn - which was that since the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was now defunct, the isolated stude nt here, there and everywhere, could now be his own initiator. This does not preclude the possibili ty that new temples might arise and have arisen in various parts of the world independently of any oth er temple. Several new temples have in recent years been formulated and are functioning very suce ssfully, with new temples emerging even now. In stating that the isolated student could now be h is own initiator, one important phrase is rendered imperative. And that is he must be persist ent and as thoroughgoing and exacting as if he were an initiator in a regularly constituted Golden Dawn temple under the constant scrutiny of officialdom and higher adept authorities. The respo nsibility for progress is thus placed inexorably on the student or candidate himself. As I see it - and I have watched this on a very few students - each elemental initiation or Watchtower ceremony require s its repetition several times. One student whom I am thinking of at this juncture has performed the w hole Opening by Watchtower ceremonies some 50 or 60 times. It is therefore my opinion that she has i nitiated herself as effectively and as positively a s any temple initiatory hierophantic team could possibly do. All the important \"command\" symbols of elemental significance are altogether imbedded in h er aura or energy field so that should she visit their sphere of activity, via skrying in the spirit vision, they would not regard her as an enemy alie n invading their hallowed circle. Instead, she would be regarded as friendly and as a divine helper beca use she carries, as it were, the only correct and valid passport recognized by them as an official passwor d."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 10 T h e onl y an d still maj or pr ob le m re ma ini n g a s of t h is mo me nt is h o w t o co n ve rt t he Neophyte and Adeptus Minor rituals into self-in itiatory operations. I a m willing to write off the Adeptus Minor ritual as impossible to convert to a self-initiatory ceremony. It still requires an authentic initiator to accomplish the purpose of this ritual. I see no possibility o f c on ve rting t his , as thi n gs sta nd at th is mo me n t. However, I still feel that the Neophyte ritual does contain the possibilities of conversion. It has been done in other ways. For exa mple Crowley, while in Mexico, did one series of meditations, almost tantric in nature, th at utilized the clairvoyant visions of G.H. Frater S. R.M.D. The latter did describe in Z-1 and Z-3 what happened to the candidate during the Neophyte initiation in full temple cerem onies. This I described in my biography of Aleister Cro wl e y, The Eve in the Triangle, Fa lcon Pre ss , 19 82 . (Alth ou gh s o me st ud ent s d isli ke Crowley the study of his life and the effec t of the Golden Dawn on him is essential to our understanding of extending the work of the O rder.) Years later, when he came to full term a s an i nitia tor hi ms elf , he wrot e a bo o k of in str ucti on e ntitl ed Liber HHH ( i ncl ud ed i n Gems from the Equinox, Falcon Press, 1982). In one section of that Liber h e refined his early meditation and created a magnificent instruct ion. This also I have quoted in The Eve in the Triangle. Ho we ve r, I a m n o t lo o ki n g in t hat dir ecti on a t t his p articu lar mo me nt . What I wish to do is so to simplify the Neophyte ritual as practiced in the Order, by deleting a number of segments which are not necessarily integr al to the process of initiation. And leaving a ceremonial skeleton which can be adapted by any student to the service of his own i nitia tio n. For e xa mp le , th e enti re se ctio n in wh ic h t he vario us o ffic ers gi ve s pe ech es describing what some of the symbols amount to and f urthermore name the various subjects that must be studied by the candidate before he can be advanced further in the Order. This wo ul d e li min ate a goo d de al of u nn ece ssa r y b agga ge a nd s hort en t he rit ual t he stu de nt wo ul d ha ve to lea rn . It is quit e l i ke l y to o tha t mo s t of th e op eni n g of t he te mp le in t he Neophyte grade could also be left out without harm to the entire initiatory process - with the exception of that passage of the Hierophant whi ch stated that by names and symbols ar e al l po we rs a wa ke ned an d re -a wa ken ed . Whe the r t he ci r cu ma mb u lati on s sh oul d be omitted I have yet to decide, on the basis of some experime ntation myself. Much the same a p pli es to t he p urifi cati on b y wate r a n d t he c ons ecr atio n b y f ire - pr oce sse s whic h are re pe ate d s e veral ti me s. T his then leaves as the most important part of the ritual the obligation at the Altar, the charge of the Hierophant to quit the night and seek the day, the reception into the Order and the Hegemon's guiding the newly initiated Neoph yte between the two pillars between t he alt ar an d t he st ati on of t he Ea st . It was only when discussing this matter with V.H. S oror Sic Itur Ad Astra in Los Angeles recently that some light was shed on this p roblem. The core of the solution revolved around the notion that initiation outside of a regu larly constituted T emple was only possible with two students. They would have to prov e to themselves - not to anyone else - that they were wholly devoted to the Great Work, de voted enought to spend at least several months jointly"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"VOLUME ONE 11 or individually practising the Middle Pillar techni que as described in The Foundations of Practical Magic, Aquarian Press, 1979. If this practice were assiduo us and intense both students would have awakened in themselves the psycho-spirit ual energy that could not only hasten their own inner development but that the latter could be comm unicated to yet another in a manner not too dissimilar to that described in Z-3. The fundamental requirement was that the initiator should be an initiator - not a layman out of the brute herd. Something must have happened to him to have redeemed him of the stigma of being \"ordinary.\" Of course it would have been better if he (or she) had been the recipient of a spontaneous mystical experience of the type described in James' Varieties of Religious Experience. Since this kind of attainment cannot be made to order, as it were, the only alternative is to fall back on time honore d methods of development and growth. I am well aware of the debate which has gone on for years as to whether mystical or occult practices can induce the mystical experience - conv ersion or samadhi or satori, call it what you will. If not, then it is maintained that these practices pre pare the student for that possibility if not induci ng it actually. And if he have patience to \"wait upon the Lord,\" as it were, then the one is as good as the other, from my point of view. While pursuing their work with the Middle Pillar te chnique and any other set of exercises to which they may be drawn, theycould set themselves t o the task of studying the Neophyte Ritual and the Z documents that pertain to it. There is additional suggestive material on this topic in The Eve In the Triangle. Using the clairvoyant description given by Mathers of what really happened between the Two Pillars to the candidate, Crowley developed a m editation incorporating all those ideas, as I have intimated above. Apparently this meditation must ha ve proven successful, for many years later after he had come to term he wrote a document for his own Or der, the A. A., known as Liber HHH. The first section of this document elaborates this meditation and transforms the clairvoyant description of Mathers into an extraordinary piece of magical work that has fascinated me for many years for as long as I have known of the Equinoxes that he published as long ago as 1909-1914. All of this could give them ideas and hints as to h ow to proceed in the task of initiating themselves or others. First one and then another co uld be helped to come to the Light in much the same way as if they were operating in a duly constituted Temple. In fact, to go one further, there is no re ason why the officers of a regular Temple should not fol low some such procedure as this themselves. It would certainly do no harm, and in fact would accom plish a great deal. Since a Golden Dawn Temple is being instituted here and there throughout not only this country, but the world as a whole, this couns el might be very useful to all concerned to enhance th e whole process of initiation. Once this were accomplished, they could either go t heir own separate ways or maintain the relationship for mutual aid and comfort. But from t here, with the aid of the Opening by Watchtower, as it has come to be called, the elemental initiations would be taken care of, and from there they face t he task of the Adeptus Minor initation. What needs to be done in"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 12 that regard is something I would rather not specula te about. But as one initiate has said, all that remains is to prepare the T emple and then hope and pray that it may become indwelled. This entire discussion however is intended to be su ggestive only. A great deal must be left to the ingenium of the student involved in thi s great adventure. Their intuition must be sharpened by their adherance to the work itself, an d their progress and their plans must be left to unfold by itself. Enough has been said at l east to show that the way is not without light, and however bleak the path seemed without te achers and a temple of the Order, they are not left to stumble unaided in the darkness of the outer world. For as the Ritual says \"My soul wanders in darkness and I seek the Light o f the hidden Knowledge\". In conclusion it is strongly suggested that student closely study two or three of the discussions in this present volume. One of them is the Cautionary Note which directly follows this. Another is a document dealing with the Inflat ion of the Ego, a result which is to be avoided at all costs by self observation and study. And fin ally the important article written by Hyatt and myself concerning some major errors and confusi ons which students have made in the past. Other documents scattered throughout the diff erent segments of this book will also be found supremely helpful in achieving the ends desir ed. A CAUT IONARY NOTE During the period of time when most of this work wa s in the manuscript phase, and various typists were working on it, their occasiona l comments concerning the Golden Dawn System perturbed me somewhat. It was Christopher Hy att one of the editors of Falcon Press who first alerted me to the possibility that this m isunderstanding might occur, suggesting therefore that I interpolate a cautionary word to p revent other readers developing the same misconception. He was absolutely right, for some of them, as well as one or two subsequent readers, seem to have developed the conception that the whol e Golden Dawn System was based on the initiatory rituals, and nothing more. It puzzle d me because I had labored under the delusion that the rituals themselves indicated with out equivocation that there was far more to the system than the rituals themselves, and also be cause the remainder of the volume itself elaborated a whole system of magical practice which could exist altogether independently of the initiatory rituals. I was so certain of this that to a couple of them I had confided that though for the time being my interest in writing was exhausted, no netheless some time in the future I felt compelled to write yet another book establishing a relationship between T ibetan magical practices, as for example laid out in Evans Wentz's book Mi/arepa the Tibetan Yogi and the Golden Dawn System. There are innumerable parallels which are worth investigating and enumerating. And these are altogether apart from th e matter of initiatory rituals. I feel strongly therefore that I must not proceed too far with this book without stressing the fact"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"VOLUME ONE 13 that there is infinitely more to the Golden Dawn Sy stem of Magic than the initiatory and other types of rituals. Not that I want to mini mize the importance of their role in the entire system but it comprises so much more that it puzzled me how anyone could avoid the realization that the performance of the rituals sat isfactorily depends on so much more. If the student has thoroughly studied the Z-1 and Z-3 docu ments, it should have dawned upon him that efficacy of any ritual depends entirely on all the participants having acquired considerable skills in the magical work prescribed by the Order. Apart from the rudimentary art of invocation by mea ns of the Pentagram and Hexagram, there is a vast repertory of techniques w hich must be used and mastered, not merely to gain advancement to a higher grade in the Order, which is not too terribly important by and of itself, but in order to become a proficient student of Magic these must be not merely known but wholly mastered. For example, assumption of God forms and the ability to build up Telesmatic Images, more or less along the same line, these two are the very foundations of practical theurgy. T hen there i s the Middle Pillar technique whose importance simply cannot be overemphasized in any w ay. The student who has neglected to achieve considerable proficiency in this particular practice will find himself frustrated at every turn. And finally there is the vibratory form ula of the Middle Pillar. I cannot conceive of a ritual of any kind being successfully consummated without being adept in the use of the vibratory formula. I have elaborated thi s in a rather new way, I fancy, in that section dealing with this matter, and I urge the pr ospective student of magic to pay particular attention not only to this, but to all t he techniques I have just mentioned. Nor is the main thesis of the Order the memorizatio n of dry Qabalistic knowledge from the Knowledge Lectures or from any other text for that matter. This material represents the dry bones of Order knowledge, the basic alphabe t of what has come to be known as the Magical Language. Every science and every Art has i ts own language without which there can be little communication. A great deal of underg raduate university work consists mainly of learning different kinds of languages that belong to the various sciences one is learning about. For example, physics has its own terminology withou t which little headway can be made in mastering its complex mysteries. The same is true o f geology which must forever remain a mystery to those who will not master its language. Even in the behavioral sciences a whole new jargon or language must be assimilated. Eventua lly many students learn to use the jargon so satisfactorily and skillfully that they become u nintelligible in their everyday conversations leading their critics to condemn the jargon in which they have steeped themselves. Nonetheless, it is a language of its ow n. It must be learned, mastered and used in order to become an effective means of communication . Much the same is true of the magical language. It is a highly complex one, and m ost of this work lays down the elemental principles of this language. The student will do we ll to take his time mastering it - that is if he has never been exposed to it before. But when he do es become familiar with this language, he will never fall into the booby trap that The Complete Golden Dawn System of"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 14 Magic comprises this item or that item only.

Finally of course there is the method of the tattwa vision, also called skrying in the spirit vision. This is most important. However I fe el entirely too much attention in the past has been paid to this method at the expense of some of those just listed. There must have been many members of the early Order who had a grea t talent for skrying, since it led to the possible development of clairvoyance, etc. For this reason, its use was overdone. Not only was this so, but some of the protective method s were neglected, and some of the people became gullible and credulous, and lost thei r natural scepticism which is one of the indispensable factors absolutely essential to the w elfare of the student of magic. Without it he is lost in a wilderness of deception and fantasy. N othing solid can be based upon this whatsoever. Of course there are also the divinatory methods of the Order. Geomancy and the Tarot. But the student must not stop there. These m ethods appear to be devoted to divining the future, etc., but it would be a great mistake i f your interpretation were limited solely to this. Apart from the fact that the use of these met hods develop intuition and the inner psychospiritual senses, there is a whole inner worl d to be explored and discovered by using the geomantic symbols and the Tarot cards themselve s as gateways to another dimension of existence, to another aspect of ourselves of which we ordinarily have little consciousness. And since the work of the Order is based upon self discovery as suggested by the injunction in the Neophyte Ritual \"Quit the night and seek the Da y,\" and by the very name of the Order itself - T he Golden Dawn, a symbolic representation of the spiritual experience which is the goal of all our work, it is the attainment of the a wareness of divinity, and then bringing this divinity to operate in our daily lives in this worl d of Malkuth which is the outer garment of God. I still like the old Qabalistic aphorism that Kether is in Malkuth, and Malkuth is in Kether but after another manner. This is not unrela ted to the Mahayana aphorism that Nirvana is Samsara and Samsara is Nirvana.

The Order is a magical one. But its mysticism is by no means to be separated from its magic. At first they may seem to be entirely different met hods of attaining to the highest. And indeed so they appear to be. But it is the mark of real adept ship when the student comes to realize that there i s no real separation between these methods, and that at the end they are one and the same. In other words, to come back to the initial theme s tated at the outset of this chapter, there is much more to the Order than the initiatory and other typ es of rituals. There is so much in the Neophyte and Adeptus Minor rituals that are of value to the aspi rant, that even if one were to assume that the Orde r work is essentially that of ritualism, one would re ally not be far wrong. They contain so much. For example in the Neophyte Ritual, one of the first ex hortations one hears is that coming from the Hierophant who states by names and images are all p owers awakened and reawakened.The newly initiated Frater or Soror into the Order could spen d considerable effort and time meditating on just what this means. When he does this, he will be led into the deepest mysteries of the teachings of the Order, and into some kind of understanding of what all the variety of Order techniques amount to. I ca n come to rest here about warning the student to disp ense with any superficial evaluation of the Order method arrived at by a rapid reading of the several rituals, or of the book itself. The whole system n eeds to be studied carefully. Don't be misled by the app arent simplicity of the system. It is enormously complex and complicated - and at the same time so b eautifully simple. It may take the student some time, perhaps years, to appreciate the simplicity o f the Order system, but the expenditure of that tim e will be found to be worth the effort. Though medita tion is not exactly harped on throughout the text, it is mentioned here and there. And my hope is that th e good student will do a great deal of meditation upon what he learns and does with the Order work. T here is much to be gained. So much is not stated in specific words, but it is in this \"non-statement\" o r understatement that much of the essence of the system is contained. Just recently (Easter, 1983) another comment was ma de, one which I have heard before from one of the Order \"failures,\" that there is a dearth of the devotional element in the Order work. Ordinarily, this comment might be expected from a f ormer Church goer steeped in the Bible - or, which amounts to the same thing, a member of the Fe llowship of the Rosy Cross, the name of the Waite version of the Golden Dawn. Ordinarily, this criticism is not worthy of note, s ave that in the last instance when I heard it, a younger student had just returned from one of the A shrams in India where he had heard a great deal about bhakta yoga. I can understand this criticism because bhakta is certainly not stressed in the ove rt sense within the Order work. But I have to remind s tudents that if they study the Order work very closely - as closely as they have been taught"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 16 to study the yoga system, they will discover a grea t deal of emotional content. For instance, on the few occasions when I have witnessed a Neophyte initiation, I have felt very close to an emotional exaltation, almost enough to bring on tears or at t he very least a sense of choking, adequate to halt speech. Moreover, the Hierophant of one of the exis tent Temples, V.H. Soror S.I.A.A., who has officiated at the initiation of some forty Neophyte s, also tells me that the ceremony often brings her to the verge of tears. Apart from that, however, I strongly urge the stude nt who may entertain similar feelings, to read once more a former work of mine What You Should Know About the Golden Dawn, (Falcon Press, Phoenix, AZ. 1983). In that book, many quotations f rom the different rituals are given, quotations whi ch are not only choice English and fine writing, but a re good examples of the devotional aspect of the Order's work. These are really worth reviewing quit e often so as to renew the sense that the Order is not without its bhakta aspects. If that is not enough, then I must refer to the wor k of Aleister Crowley who, after all, whatever is said and done, was once a member of the Order an d owes a very great deal to his Initiation therein. I especially suggest reading his instruction which re views the whole Eastern attitude about bhakta - Liber Astarte vel Bervlli to be found in one of the Equinoxes, or in my book Gems from the Equinox (Falcon Press, Phoenix, AZ. 1982). So far as I am c oncerned, this Liber is a masterpiece, which I can strongly recommend especially to one co mplaining of the absence of devotional writing in the Order. Furthermore, and this I think is paramount, there i s Crowley's early masterpiece Three Holy Books originally published by Sangreal Foundation with a short introduction by me, but which I understand wi ll be republished by Samuel Weiser Inc. of New York. This volume contains Liber LXV or The Book of the Heart Girt with a Serpent, Liber VII or Liber Lapidis Lazuli, and finally Liber 813 vel Ararita. All three are superbly written and breathe devotion in every word. I am particularly fond of LXV and V II which Falcon Press is issuing as cassettes, contain ing Liber LXV, or The Book of the Heart Girt with a Serpent, Liber VII orLiber Lapidus Lazuli, and Liber DCCCX111 or Ararita. Periodically I will play the tape on retiring to bed at night, and perm itting myself to fall asleep listening to its beaut y and devotion. It may be stretching definitions of thing s pretty far to state that these may be considered part of the Order's devotional literature. But on the other han d I would rather consider these to be in that categ ory than the religious lucubrations of Mr. A.E. Waite who wa s also once a member of the Order. He founded his o wn Fellowship, and rewrote the Rituals (three of which are included in a later section of this book) to i nclude many excerpts from the Bible and perhaps from the R oman missal. I am not to be construed as being antagonistic to the latter by any means, but I do s tate strongly that if I must use one or the other, I prefer to use the so-called holy books of Aleister Crowley . They convey more devotion and love to me than almost anything else. So that if there is actually a dearth of devotional material in the Rituals and work of the Order, it is more than compensated for by re ference to the work of a former member, Aleister Crowley. I trust that this will be the end of any c omplaints about this topic."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"VOLUME ONE 17 THE PROPER ATTITUDE TOWARD MIND-BODY By ISRAEL REGARDIE AND CHRISTOPHER S. HYATT Over the past fifty years I have insisted that the serious magical student seek a course of therapy as a safeguard against some of the catastro phic results which appear to overtake too many of our promising students. The difficulties seem to arise from the following: THE SUPEREGO AND THE H.G.A. A. The confusion between the Freudian superego (the unconscious infantile conscience) and the Order's concept of the Higher and Divine Ge nius (or the H.G.A.) Many students as well as those not involved with Ma gic often substitute a form of their infantile conscience for one form of \"Higher Self\" or another. This can lead to nothing but disaster. Instead of being guided by a Higher Genius the pers on is really at the mercy of infantile \"voices\" and values, so-called brain chatter. Not only does this cause undue individual suffering and deception, it also causes a complete halt to any real progress in the Theurgic arts and sciences. To a large extent this confusion contributes to the often \"bad\" reputation students of the occult possess. Those of you familiar with the history of the Order can find glowing examples of this folly. However there is no need to delve this deeply. Almo st any group or Order has members and often leaders who have fallen head long into this pit dug for the unwary. THE INFLATION OF THE EGO B. There is a frightening frequency of the occurrenc e of the inflation of the ego -- sometimes referred to as infantile megalomania. To help the student understand this difficulty let us define the healthy ego as a computer type decision maker. The ego's function is to help the person make decisions based on hard data. The purpose of t his function should be that of survival and personal fulfillment on various levels or planes. I n one sense the healthy ego is more or less non- personal. It realizes cause and effect in Malkuth, and understands its limitations. On the other hand infantile megalomania is a natura l occurrence in infancy, and with proper development has been outgrown by the healthy adult ego. However, while this is the ideal it rarely occurs in practice, and requires some form of \"ther apy\" Eastern or Western to accomplish this goal. In the practice of Magic or anything which releases un usual amounts of energy from the unconscious the infantile megalomaniacal substructure is re-activat ed, and all the illusions and delusions of self importance and elevation of babyhood re-emerge."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 18 This flattery overwhelms the ego. The person takes the impersonal and universal nature of the powers he or she experiences as if he or she created the powers or experiences by what they call - themselves. If this experience called by Jung the \"Mana Persona lity\" persists for too long a period the person becomes ego-maniacal and thoroughly self -centered. T his can be observed in patients undergoing psychotherapy as well as in the so-called normal man on the street. T his excessive self-admiration or as J ung puts it \" the naive concretization of primordial images\" leads to an overinflated ego which in the e nd leads directly to disaster and contradicts in toto the purpose of the Great Work. The student should be also cautioned that the oppos ite of infantile megalomania is not milk-toast humility and passiveness. The latter is the sine qua non of a deeply buried and potentially more dangerous form of infantile megalo mania. T HE PROPER ATT IT UDE T OWARD T HE INST INCT S C. T here is a danger of the blatant acting out of i nstincts which have been distorted through repression and denial on the one hand or th eir compulsive repression leading to a boring and unfulfilled sex life. Almost everyone ra ised in the current Judaic-Christian morality suffers inevitably from a totally distorte d attitude towards this topic as well as to all biologic functions in general. Therefore a complete sex life which is not only pleasurable but aids in the evolution of the Soul is totally out of the question. What is required is a a healthy attitude toward all bodily functions, reme m bering always that Kether is in Malkuth and Malkuth is in Kether, but after another manner. Those involved with the Great Work have often found themselves falling into the camps of excess in one direction or another, i.e. t oo much or too little. T he proper use and enjoyment of sex is a necessary part in the discove ry and development of the Higher Genius. Aleister Crowley is one of very few who has recognized the reality of this problem, although he himself at times, due to his Plymouth B rethren upbringing, fell into the same booby trap. Most of us are plagued by an average so mewhat inhibited sex life, or worse yet a compulsive acting out of our repressed sexual drive s. These attitudes do not aid the development of self-expression, deep and total rela xation, or serve as a vehicle for opening the deeper channels which lie within. T HE PROBLEM OF RELIGION AND T HE GREAT WORK This opens the way to a discussion of a very seriou s point which has long been on my mind. It emerges into the open by the inclusion in this volume of some of the Rituals of A.E. Waite. Mathers and the Order he founded were only n ominally Christian. One has to search meticulously through the Rituals and other teaching for serious literal interpretations of the historical Jesus. In reality they are absent. The r eferences to Osiris as a symbol of man - made - perfect could be those of any of the mythica l Mediterranean crucified Gods, of whom there were many. The Order was a Hermetic Brotherho od and Christianity played"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"VOLUME ONE 19 only a minimal role in its operation. Mathers was o n friendly with Anna Kingsford who had founded another Hermetic Society in which Christian ity did play a prominent part. But he never permitted this friendship to influence him to make his Society similar to hers. There is a very interesting set of concepts here th at need only to be touched on. And that is the constant effort made by some occult teachers to Chr istianize the ancient wisdom religion. I have already mentioned Anna Kingsford as one. Another, w ho influenced Dr. Felkins tremendously was Rudolph Steiner who seemed determined to Christiani ze occultism in grotesque ways that are fundamentally opposed to the innate conceptual natu re of Magic. In this he was following in the foot steps of Annie Besant and Bishop Leadbeater who had already succeeded in corrupting Blavatskian Theosophy, trans-forming it into a Christian occult ism with Eastern overtones. Though Steiner was in conflict with them, nonetheless their doctrines must have affected him profoundly, despite his so- called clairvoyance being in opposition to the so-c alled clairvoyance of Leadbeater. While this was going on Waite who had been raised a s a Roman Catholic seemed determined to follow in the footsteps of the above named teach ers. After the revolt of 1900 in the Order he was one of the several committee members who ran the Or der. Later he pulled out from this committee to form his own Fellowship of The Rosy Cross. When thi s happened he totally revised not merely the rituals of the Order but the entire philosophic con text of the Order. In this volume three of his Ritu als are included. From them the discriminating reader w ill be able to determine to what extent this perversion of the Order methodology had advanced. T here is almost no relationship between the teachings originally laid down and the later biblic al emphasis introduced by Waite. This of course resulted in the introduction of Chur ch concepts of morality and purity which are evident in almost everything that Waite wrote. His whole attitude became sex-negative as well as occult-negative. He made it almost a point of honou r to eradicate any reference to every item in the Magical cut riculum laid down by Mathers and Westco tt. Fortunately when he died in the late 1930's his Order died with him and so did his sex-negative attitudes, as well as his wretched pompous English -- characterized by a need to use Latin phrases whe re simple English would have been much better. Contrary to the common point of view he must have b een a very ambitious person and this is made evident by the pompous titles he gave both to himse lf in the Rituals as well as to his attendant officers. EGOTISM One of the great dangers inherent within the practi ce of Magic and indeed of all the occult arts -- is the development of an enormous egotism c haracterized by messianic feelings, infantile omnipotence and the utter destruction of any capaci ty for effective self-criticism. It appears that as the student becomes more adept in the skills of meditat ion, skrying, or ceremonial work, he becomes more threatened by an inflation of the ego. It appears s lowly and insidiously, without apparent warning. Only those people who are closely related to or ass ociated with the student become aware of the subtle metamorphosis"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 20 that occurs. T he student rarely is conscious of thi s unconscious transformation. Attempting to make him aware of this egotism is doo med to failure; it is like knocking on a stone wall. It seems to afflict the aspirant who functions outs ide the borders of an occult order or legitimate magical school. In this sense, most s tudents come within the jurisdiction of this definition. T hose who practice their occult work un der the aegis of a legitimate magical body or under the guidance of an experienced and wi se guru or teacher seem to be more protected from this inflation -- unless the guru ha s himself fallen under the spell of his own messianic fantasies and inflation. If he has, then he communicates his fatal sickness to his students. Or else he is wholly blinded to the debac le about to occur to his student. One has only to look at the history of most modern occultists and I use them preferentially because their history is more readil y authenticated than those of earlier times - - to perceive how valid this phenomenon is. So many of them developed fantastic notions of their own unique importance and role in the world o r even cosmic picture. Only recently I heard of one who claimed to have been the teacher o f Jesus! There are an almost infinite number of variations of this theme. It is a definite and ever present danger, and all s tudents of occultism within or without occult orders must become conscious of this phenomenon. Otherwise they are doomed. They experience what appears to be at first an enhancement of life-feelings, a rich harvest of previously unknown information and knowl edge, and the awareness that destiny has suddenly acquired a new direction, -- only to c ollapse later in total frustration, ignominy, and exile from all of society. From the theoretical viewpoint, the gradual expansi on of the confines of the limited ego by magical practices, leads to contact of some kind with the `unconscious'. A new source of energy is released, an energy which is seen as c arrying with it not only new feelings but new knowledge and a greater capacity for self-confidenc e with the ability to impress and motivate one's fellow man. This energy floods the u nprepared ego with almost infinite promise. Unless the candidate is properly prepared for this phenomenon, or is guided and guarded by a competent experienced teacher, he is l ikely to take this seriously. Effective self-criticism seems to have vanished in thin air. Crowley seems to have been most conscious of this i n some of his earlier work. He himself had a couple of admirable teachers -- Alan Bennett, George Cecil Jones and Oscar Eckenstein. For example in one section of Liber 0 he wrote: `This book is very easy to misunderstand; readers are asked to use the most mi nute critical care in the study of it. even as we have done in its preparation. In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth and the Paths; of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Plan es and many other things which may or may not exist. It is immaterial whether these exist or not. By doing certain things certain results will follow; students are most earnestly wa rned against attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them. T here is littl e danger that any student, however idle or stupid, will fail to get some result; but there is great danger that he will be led astray,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"VOLUME ONE 21 obsessed and overwhelmed by his results, even thoug h it be by those which it is necessary that he should attain. Too often, moreove r, he mistaketh the final resting-place for the goal, and taketh off his armour as if he were a victor ere the fight is well begun.' Some few other occultists familiar with the practic al side of things also utter similar warnings. Blavatsky in her Voice of the Silence also warns that `under every flower a serpent coiled.' And in a footnote in this warning, she add s: The astral region, the psychic world of supersensous perception and of deceptive sights -- the world of mediums. It is the great `Astral Serpent' of Eliphas Levi. No blossom picked in those regions has ever yet been brought down to earth without its serpent coiled around the stem. It is the world of the Great Illusion. ' Only a good guru of almost superhuman powers of eff ective self-evaluation and examination provide the means of avoiding inflation and the consequent disaster. A third means is almost any form of good psychotherapy. The latter appears to be able to drain off the massive uncontrolled quantities of energy that are released and direct them into new and constructive goals. Those Reichians who have an und erstanding of `occult' matters would appear to be more effective than most in dealing wi th the phenomenon. Jung has also described it most extensively in an e xtraordinarily good essay in a book entitled Two Essays on Analytical Psychology. However, the methods of therapy described by Jung and practised by his followers leave a lot to be desired. Every occult student should not merely read this book but own it, in order to provi de the opportunity to read and re-read many times the chapter dealing with inflation of th e ego. It is his contention that the analysand, the patien t undergoing therapy -- analagous to the enterprising student beginning his occult work -- attempts to identify his ego with the collective psyche. He does this as a means of escap ing the pain and anxiety resulting from the collapse of his conscious persona or self, whic h is one of the primary effects of the analysis. To free himself from the seductive embrac e of the collective psyche, instead of denying it as some others have done, he accepts it so totally that he is devoured or overwhelmed by it, becomes lost in it, and thus is no longer capable of perceiving it as a separate entity. As another student once put it, in stead of realizing that they have become illuminated by God, they affirm that they are God. Thus the inflation begins. It ends disastrously when or if the `God' discovers he is n ot omniscient or omnipotent. But by then it is generally too late. It would not do the student harm to re-read the sta tement by Hyatt and myself on the problems confronting the serious occult student in the beginning of this book. Also while at times outrageous Hyatt's book Undoing Yourself with Energized Meditation (Falcon Press, 1982), makes good sense in this context."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 22 T HE M AGICAL AL P HABET T h e Kn o wle d ge Le ctu re s of th e Gold en Da wn wer e fra g me n ts , i sol ated a nd brief , o f general occult information that were handed to t he student after each initiation.

The result was that he could, and often did, w ind up hopelessly confused, without the slightest idea of what all this information really amounted to, and gave up the work of the Or der . S. L. Mathers' book The Kabballah Unveiled had only just been published prior to the f or mat io n of the Her e met ic Ord er of th e Gold en Da wn ( in th e Outer ). M uc h of the Qabalistic information of several Knowledge Lecture s quite evidently had been extrapolated from his Introduction to this book.

A large part of the Introduction is herewith duplicated to s ho w th e co nn ecti on s bet wee n t he b oo k an d Kn o wle d ge Le ctu res . Apart from this book, there were not a great many a uthorities students could consult in order to enlarge and round out their information of what the Knowledge Lectures were merely hinting at.

He therefore deserves enormous commendati on for his energy, insight and ability to probe into and clarify the obscure and archaic lite rature that he was determined to find. Some critics have been capriciously hostile assumin g that any T om, Dick or Harry would have had the perspicacity and intelligence to have discovered the information that Mathers was looking for. I have spent never ending hours ov er periods of months and years in the mid-thirties attempting, fruitlessly, to duplicate what Mathers, in his genius, knew what he wa s l oo kin g for .

It should never hav e been written or published. Paul F. Case's book on the T arot, had it then existed, would have proved invaluable. Franz Hartman, with Theosophical connections had wr itten a book on Geomancy based on earlier writings. It would have provided a dditional material the enterprising student could have used, though the esoteric keys u nique to the Golden Dawn's later Inner Order work were not described. He was also the auth or-editor of In the Pronaos of the Temple, a very imformative little book which reproduced some of the forgotten Rosicrucian legends and source material from an earlier period of time. And we must not forget what has since become a classic in the Rosicrucian and Alchemical fields The Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians. General symbolism could have been picked up from a variety of miscellaneous sources. There was a general stirring, and occult a nd spiritual matters were in the air. But for the general student of the Mysteries who wa s not a scholar, or had a penchant for independent research, the basic knowledge mater ial was all disconnected data and pretty much of a closed book. All he could do was t o memorize the stuff by rote, and ask questions of the Officers of the Temple he belonged to. They may or may not have been too helpful. One of the common cliches was that the elu cidation of this or that set of notions was reserved for a higher grade. Very frustrating! Be that as it may, by the time the student had comp leted his passage through the grades of the Outer Order he was in possession of a good d eal of basic material. A great deal more than one would think at first sight. It was handed out piecemeal which was also a good idea; otherwise were it presented en masse as it was in a previous publication of mine he would have been swamped and overwhelmed by a mass of whol ly indigestible material. Whether he was able to tie it all together and integrate it, b y the time he got to the Inner Order, into a meaningful and workable system is a moot point.

However, the fact remains that what was given in th e Knowledge Lectures served as the barebones of what could be called the Magical A lphabet. Without this, most occult or magical literature is a closed book. With it, even if only partly understood, you have an open sesame to some of the most profound ideas and practical systems of personal development ever devised. All of this constituted t he skeleton of a profound philosophical system. The task today is so much easier for the student wh o really wishes to study and master the basics.

However unimportant these matt ers may seem to the layman or the investigator approaching these topics from the outside, these are several of the most useful magical procedures for which I can find no p recedent.

It was int en de d to b e supplemented by further reading, study, meditation, and of course by skrying. In this way, the magical language, and in turn the philosophy, c ould be developed on a individual basis. For example, a book I wrote as far back as 1932, The Tree of Life, served that purpose for me. It presented a systematic overview of the magical p hilosophy with some of its practices that, despite its verbosity and addiction to adjectivitis , has nonetheless been lauded as one o n e of t he be st cu rre nt bo o ks o f i ts ki nd . In effect, I wish to counsel the student not alread y familiar with this schema, to approach the following material as might have the s tudent of a century ago. Deal with it in small segments so that you do not get overwhelmed b y an overview of a vast mass of material which appears to have no unifying principl e. The latter is there alright, but the preliminary material needs first to be committed to memory and studied in small segments to avoid psychic indigestion.

I n the Zohar there is a pretty legend, rather long-winded but el oquent, about each letter of the alphabet, and how B, the second lette r of the alphabet, came to be used as the first letter of the first word of the Bible - Beras hith meaning In the Beginning. There are two main translations of the Zohar that y ou could make use of, depending on which one you may have access to. Some of the li braries may have the translation of Simon and Sperling; others may have the shorter but earlier version of Nurho de Manhar. (Wizard Book Shelf, San Diego, CA. 1978). Regardles s of whose translation you use, read or study the account of each letter appearing before G od imploring Him to use that particular letter for the first word of Genesis. It is interes ting reading, full of symbolism of one kind or another, and may throw a great deal of light for you on the motives for Mathers' statement that Hebrew letters are magical symbols and as such must be treated with respect and honor. T HE MYST ICISM OF T HE ALPHABET \"Rabbi Chananya spake, and said: Before creation be gan, the alphabetical letters were in reversed order; thus the two first words in the Book of Genesis, Berashith, bara, begin with B; the next two, Alhim, ath, with A. Why did it not commence with A, the first l etter? The reason of this inversion is as follows: For two tho usand years before the creation of the world the letters were concealed and hidden, being objects of divine pleasure and delight. \"When the Divine Being, however, willed to create t he world, all the letters appeared before His presence in their reverse order . T he first ascended and said: `Lord of the Universe! let it please Thee to create the worl d by me, as I am the final letter of the word Emeth - (truth), which is graven on Thy signet ring . T hou T hyself art called Emeth, and therefore it will become Thee, the great King, to b egin and create the world by me: Said the Holy One (blessed by He): `T hou, oh, T av, are indee d worthy, but I cannot create the world by thee; for thou art destined to be not only the c haracteristic emblem borne by faithful students of the law, from beginning to end, but als o the associate of Maveth (death), of which thou art the final letter. Therefore the crea tion of the world cannot, must not, be through thee.' \"After Tav had disappeared, Sh ascended and said: ` I pray Thee, Lord of the Universe, as bearing Thy great name Shaddai (almighty), to cr eate the world by me, by the holy name that becometh Thee only.' Said the Holy One: `T hou art truly, o Shin, worthy, pure and true; but letters that go to form lying and falseho od will associate themselves with thee. viz.: Koph (Q) and Resh (R), and with thee will make up S heQeR (a lie), Falsehood, in order that it may be received and credited, come first wi th the appearance of truth (Sh), which thou representest, and for this reason I will not c reate the world by thee.' So Shin departed and Q and R, having heard these words, dared not pr esent themselves before the divine presence."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"VOLUME ONE 27 \" T Z then went before Him, saying: `Because I mark t he Zaddikim (the righteous), and Thou Thyself hearest me in Thy name, Zaddik (righteous), and also it is written, The righteous Lord loveth righteousness, it will become Thee to create the wo rld by me.' Then said the Holy One: `Zaddi, Zaddi, thou art truly righteous, but thou must keep thysel f concealed, and thy occult meaning must not be made known or b:,:;ome revealed; and therefore thou must not be used in the creation of the world. Thy original form was a rod, symbol of the male pri nciple, surmounted by Yod, a letter of the holy Name, and also of the Holy Covenant, and emblem of the male principle. (By this, reference is made to the first man, who was androgynous, with faces t urning one to the right, the other to the left, as symbolized in the figure of Zaddi in the Hebrew alp habet). But the time will come that thou shall be divided, and thy faces shall then be turned to each other.' \"Zaddi then departed, and P ascended and said: `1 a m the beginning of the salvation (Peragna) and deliverance (Peduth) thou will execut e in the world. It will be fitting to create it by me.\"Thou art worthy,' replied the Holy One, `but th ou also givest rise to Evil (Peshang), and in thy form resemblest those animals who walk with droopin g heads, like wicked men who go about with bowed heads and extended hands.

And forthwith Ayin departed. \"S then went and pleaded: `1 am near (Samech) to th e fallen ones, as it is written: The Lord upholdeth (soumekh) all them that fall. Thou must r eturn, Samech, to thy place,' was the reply of the Holy One, and must not leave it; for if thou dost, what will become of the fallen, who will need and look to thee for aid and support? ' Samech forthwith returned, and was followed by N, who said: `Oh thou Holy One! that Thou mayest be venerated in pra ises (Nura tehillim), and also because the praise o f the righteous will be a Nava (delight), let it plea se Thee to create the world by me.' To whom He replied: `Nun, return thou to thy place with the fa llen (Nephelim), for whose sake Samech hath gone back to her place, and lean for support upon her.' \"M then followed after, saying: `Thou wilt by me be called Malech (king).\"Truly so,'said He, `but I will not, for all that, create the world by thee. Go back at once to thy place with thy compani on letters, L and CH; for there must be a King, and fo r the world to be without one would not be seemly. At that moment CH descended from off the throne of light and splendor, exclaiming; `I am thy glory, create the world by me.' As it stood trembling with excitement before the Holy One, two hundred thousand worlds together with the throne itself wer e seized with a sudden tremor and seemed ready to fall. `Caph, Caph!' cried the Holy One, `what ha st thou done? I will not create the world by thee, for thou beginnest Chala (ruin, loss). Return at on ce to thy place on the throne of glory and abide there!' Then Caph retired and went back to its plac e. \" Y next appeared and claimed that being the initial letter in the divine name YHVH, it was the best for the work of creation.

When answering him, it had been my intention to assert that the explanations had alrea dy been given. When, however, I proceeded to examine the obsolete book anew, I found that this h ad been carelessly omitted. (Falcon Press has just issued several tapes which give the correct pronunc iation of most of the Qabalistic and other words used in this text.) My reply took a page and a half to clarify the issu e. In order to eliminate possible repetitions of this expenditure of time and effort, let me offer t he following. I can best begin by asserting that no matter where or by whom spoken, English is English. The accents used, for example, in the North of England are entirely different from those employed in Kent or Sussex in the South of England. The English of W ales sounds strangely melodious compared to that of Surrey or Northampton. All however are English. Much the same is true in the United States. The acc ent of an inhabitant of Minnesota is entirely different from one who lives in Alabama or Georgia. All speak that variety of English we know as American. Which one is correct? Let me say that there is no standard or fixed accen t which is accepted universally as authoritative. I fancy much the same is true of eve ry other language. Northern and Southern Italian va ry in many ways. So also in Germany, France and elsewh ere. Accents and dialects are integral parts of the linguistic process. This is true also in Hebrew which is part of the ma gical language of what has come to be called the Western esoteric tradition. There are two main streams of Hebrew pronunciation called the Ashkenazic relating to North Europe, England and th e United States, and the Sephardic spoken in the Mediterranean and Levantine areas. The history of t hese two streams is really irrelevant to this essay . Anyone interested can do a little research in a goo d encyclopedia. The Mediterranean area, as we know historically, ac hieved a higher level of cultural development far earlier than did Northern Europe. M uch of the Qabalistic literature had its origins in Spain where there was a fascinating merger of Chris tian, Arabic and Hebrew mysticisms in pre-Zoharic times, as well as in the Levantine area as a whole. The obvious result of this cultural superiority wa s that the spoken Hebrew had a Sephardic accent. When the literature came to be translated by later scholars and Christian Qabalists, the translations or better still transliterations took on the Sephar dic flavor. Much later in the 18th century, when there was a re vival of Jewish mysticism called Chassidism, in Central Europe, Poland and Russia, t he Ashkenazic accent or dialect was"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 30 employed. Regardless of how popular Chassidism beca me, English translators persisted on t he wh ole i n u sin g th e S ep har dic d ial e ct , whi ch i s int ere stin g b ec aus e Baa l S h e m, the founder of what became the Chassidic move ment, obviously used Ashkenazic Hebrew. It seems, however, that the Sephardic diale ct and the whole Qabalistic literary corpus were intimately bound together, so that very few could conceive that there was any other way of tra nsli terati n g He bre w. T his pers ist ed ri gh t up t o mo der n ti me s. S. L . Mat her s i n hi s Kaballah Unveiled, Arthur E. Waite in all of his Qabalistic writings, and Frater Albertus in one of the early Alchemical Bulletins, amongst m any other distinguished writers, all used t he S ep har dic di ale ct. It so happened that when I began my interest in the Qabalah in my mid-teens, I wanted to be able to translate some of the important books and manuscripts that yet remained to be rendered into English. The head of the Semitic Divi sion of the Library of Congress whom I came to know in those days - I must have made mysel f a young nuisance to him requesting information about Qabalistic texts in English - rec ommended that I get a tutor from whom I could learn Hebrew. As a result I had a year's inte nsive training in Hebrew from a young man attending George Washington University in Washingto n, D.C., where I then lived. Many years later, when I had learned to manipulate letters and numbers (Gematria) with so me de xter it y, I fo u nd th at on o cca sio n th e A sh ke na zi c t ra nslit er atio ns wer e f ar mo r e us ef ul an d il lu min ati n g th an th e Se ph ardic , as I d e mo nstr ate d i n an e arli er bu t no w o bs olet e bo o k on th e Qa bal ah .

In 1 93 1, wh ile I was i n a Lo nd on lit erar y environment, serving as a secretary to first one an d then another novelist and author, I was encouraged to put my ideas in book form. I did so. It became my first published book a long time ago. I had hoped that the use of the Ashkenazi c dialect which had solved a number of ge ma t ria pr obl e ms fo r me , wou ld attr act s o me att ent i on fr o m ot her stu de nts a nd authorities and be used constructively in other tex ts. No such thing ha ppened. Since that book was written in the early 1930's, I have seen m y Ashkenazic transliterations used only three or four times at most. I was disappointed, I must confess, so that in later writings I dropped it, returning to the more conventional spel ling and transliteration of the Hebrew al p hab et an d Qaba listi c ter ms . When the State of Israel declared its independence in 1947. with Hebrew as its official la n gua ge, natu ral l y th e Se ph ard ic dia lect wa s use d si nce P ale sti ne was p art of t he Levantine area. That confirmed my decision to drop the Ashkenazic style of transliteration. It must not be supposed however that every Jewish c ommunity in Europe or the United States has dropped the Ashkenazic dialect by any manner or means. It is still used. But if you went to the State of Israel, your Ashken azic dialect will hardly be understood, any more than you could make heads or tails out of the Sephardic dialect if you happened to be a n Ash ke na zi ."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"VOLUME ONE 31 It is r ath er as if so me on e bo rn a nd br ed in Nort hu m b er lan d or Yor ksh ire c oul d ma ke much sense out of the Cockney accent used in p arts of London.

But, never let it be f orgotten, they are all speaking English - in much the same way that anyone speaking the Ashkenaz ic dialect or the Sephardic dialect is speaking or re adi n g Heb re w. This is the core of the Hebrew language problem of the Qabalah in the simplest possible terms. So when I have used \"Bes\" or \"Ches\" or \"Tes\" I am referring to the same letters as \" B e t h , \" \" C h e t h , \" or \"Teth.\" Keser and T ip haras and Malkus are no other than Kether and Tiphareth and Malkuth - and so on and so forth.

From Adam it passed over to Noah, and then to Abraham, the friend of Go d, who emigrated with it to Egypt, where the patriarch allowed a portion of this myste rious doctrine to ooze out. It was in this way that t h e E gyp ti ans o btai ne d s o me kn o wle d ge of i t , an d t he ot her Ea ste rn nati on s c ou ld introduce it into their philosophical systems .

By the aid of this mysterious science the law-giver was enabled to solve the difficulties which arose during his management of the Israelites , in spite of the pilrimages, wars, and frequent miseries of the nation. He covertly laid d own the principles of this secret doctrine in the first four books of the Pentateuch, but withhel d them from Deuteronomy. Moses also initiated the seventy elders into the secrets of th is doctrine, and they again transmitted them from hand to hand. Of all who formed the unbro ken line of tradition, David and Solomon were the most deeply initiated into the Qab alah. No one, however, dared to write it down, till Schimeon Ben Jochai, who lived at the time of the destruction of the second temple .. .

Thus the letter shin, Sh, is 300, and is equivalent to the number obtaine d by adding up the numerical values of the letters of the words RVCH A LHIM, Ru ac h Elo hi m, the spirit of the Elohim; and it is therefore a symbol of the spirit of the Elohim.

I think these instances will suffice to make clear the nature of Gematria, especially as many others will be found in the course of the ensuing wo r k. Notariqon is derived from the Latin word notarius, a short-hand writer. Of Notariqon there are two forms. In the first every l etter of a word is taken for the initial or abbreviation of another word, so that from the lett ers of a word a sentence may be formed. T hus every letter of the word BRAShIT h, Berashith, the first word in Genesis, is made the inital of a wo rd , an d we o btai n fro m it BRASh IT h RA H AL HIM Ah IQBLV IS h RAL T hV RH, Berashith Rah/ Elohim Shel'equebelo Israel Torah: \" In the beginning the Elohim saw that Is ra el woul d ac ce pt t he la w.\" T h e s ec on d f or m of Nota riq on is t hat e xact r eve rs e of th e f irst .

T hus the Qaba lah is c alle d ChK Mh NST h RH, Chok hma h Nest hor ah , \"th e sec ret wisd o m;\" a nd if we take the initials of these two words Ch and N , we form by the second kind of Notariqon the word ChN, Chen, \"grace.\" Similarly, from the initials and finals of the words MI IOLH LN V HSh M I M H, Mi Iaulah Leno Ha-Shama yimah, \"Who shall go up for us to heaven?\" ( De ut . xx x. 1 2) . are fo rme d M IL H, Mila h \" c ir cu mc isi on ,\" a nd IHVH, th e T e tragr a mma t o n, i mp l yi n g t hat Go d hat h or dai ne d circ u mci sio n a s t he wa y t o he a ve n . Temura is permutation. According to certain rules, one letter is substituted for another letter preceding or following it in the alp habet, and thus from one word another word of totally different orthography may be formed . T hus the alphabet is bent exactly in half, in the middle, and one half is put over the o ther; and then by changing alternately the first letter or the first two letters at the beginn ing of the second line, twenty two commutations are produced. T hese are called the \"Ta ble of the Combinations of T zIRVP,\" tziruph.

T he n comes the \"Rational Table of T ziruph,\" another set of twenty-two combin ations. There are also three \"Tables of the Commutations,\" known respectively as the Right, the Averse, and the Irregular. T o make any of these, a square, containing 484 squares , should be made, and the letters written in. For t he \" Ri ght T a ble\" writ e the al p hab e t ac ros s fro m ri ght t o lef t; in t he s ec on d ro w of squares do the same, but begin with B and end with A; in the third begin with G and end with B; and so on. For the \"Averse T able\" write the alphabet from right to left backwards, beginning with Th and ending with A ; in the second row begin with Sh and end with Th, etc. The \"Irregular Table\" would take too long to describe. Besides all these, there is the method called ThShRQ, Thashraq, which is simply writing a word backwards. T here is one more very important form, called the \" Qabalah of the Nine Chambers,\" or AIQ BKR, Aiq Bekar. It is thu s for me d: 3 0 0 3 0 3 2 0 0 2 0 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 Sh L G R K B Q I A 600 60 6 500 50 5 400 40 4 M (f) S V K (f) N H Th M D 900 90 9 800 80 8 700 70 7 Tz (f) Tz T P (f) P Ch N (f) 0 Z I have put the numeration of each letter above to s how the affinity between the letters in each chamber. Sometimes this is used as a cipher , by taking the portions of the figure to show the letters they contain, putting one point fo r the first letter, two for the second, etc. T hus the right angle, containing AIQ, will answer f or the letter Q if it has three dots or points within it. Again, a square will answer for H , N, or K final, according to whether it has o ne , t wo, or thr ee po in ts r es pec ti vel y pla ce d wit hi n it . So als o with re gar d t o t he oth er letters. But there are many other ways of employing the Qabalah of the Nine Chambers, which I have not space to describe. I will merely m ention, as an example, that by the mode of Temura called AThBSh, Athbash, it is found that in Jeremiah xxv. 26, the word ShSh k, Sheshakh, s ymb ol i ze s BBL , Babel. Besides all these rules, there are certain meanings hidden in the shape of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet; in the form of a particular le tter at the end of a word being different from that which it generally bears when it is a fin al letter, or in a letter being written in the middle of a word in a character generally used only at the end; in any letter or letters being written in a size smaller or larger than the rest o f the manuscript, or in a letter being written upside"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 36 down; in the variations found in the spelling of ce rtain words, which have a letter more in some places than they have in others; in pe culiarities observed in the position of any of the po int s or acc ent s, an d i n cert ain e xp res si on s s up po se d t o be el lip tic or r ed un dan t.

The consequence of this is that the total numerical value of the word, instead of being 30 + 40 + 200 + 2 + 5 equals 277, is 30 + 600 + 200 + 2 + 5 equals 837, by Gematria ThTh ZL , Tat Zal, t h e pr ofu se Gi ve r.

The qaba listical symbology contained in this circumstance is explained as follows.

To define negative existence clearly is impossible, for when it is distinctly defined it ceases to be negative e xistence; it is then negative existence passing i nto stat ic co nditi on . T h eref or e wise l y ha ve the Qa b alist s s hu t o ut f ro m mo r ta l comprehension the primal AIN, Ain, the negatively existent One, and the AIN SVP, Ain Soph, t he li mitle ss Exp an sio n; whi le of e ven the AIN S VP AV R, Ain Soph Aur, t he illimitable Light, only a dim conception can be for med. Yet, if we think deeply, we shall see that such must be the primal forms of the unknowabl e and nameless One, whom we, in the mo s t ma nife st for m s pe a k o f as Go d. He is th e Abs ol ut e. Bu t how d o we defi ne t he Absolute? Even as we define it, it slips from our g rasp, for it ceases when defined to be the Absolute. Shall we then say that the Negative, the Limitless, the Absolute are, logically speaking, absurd, since they are ideas which our re ason cannot define? No; for could we define them, we should make them, so to speak, cont ained by our reason, and therefore not superior to it; fora subject to be capable of defin ition it is requisite that certain limits should b e ass i gnab le to it . How the n ca n we li mi t t he Il li mit abl e? The first principle and axiom of the Qabalah is the name of the Deity, translated in our version of the Bible, \"I am that I am,\" AHIH AS hR AHIH, Eheieh Asher Eheieh. A better tr an slati on is , Existence is existence, o r I am He who is. Eliphas Levi Zahed, that great philosopher and Qaba list of the present century, says in his Histoire de la Magie ( b k. i . c h. 7): \"T he Qa bal ists h a ve a hor ro r o f e ve r yth in g th at r ese mb le s id olatr y; the y, ho we ve r asc rib e th e h u ma n for m t o God , b ut it is a pu rel y hieroglyphical figure.

He is in all , distinct from all, and greater than all. His very name is ineffable; and yet this name only expr esses the human ideal of His Divinity. What God is in Himself it is not given to man to kn ow. God is the absolute of faith; existence is the absolute of reason, existence exists by itself, and because it exists. The reason of the existence of existence is existence itself. We may ask, \"Why does any particular thing exist?\" that is, \"Why does such or such a thing exi st?\" But we cannot ask, without its being absurd to do so, \"Why does existence exist?\" For th is would be to suppose existence prior to existence.\" Again, the same author says (ibid. bk. iii. ch. 2): \"To say, I will believe when the truth of the dogma shall be scientifically proved t o me,\" is the same as to say, I will believe when I have nothing more to believe, and wh en the dogma shall be destroyed as dogma by becoming a scientific theorem. That is to say, in other words: \"I will only admit the Infinite when it shall have been explained, det ermined, circumscribed, and defined for my benefit; in one word, when it has become finite. I will then believe in the Infinite when I am sure that the Infinite does not exist. I will be lieve in the vastness of the ocean when I shall have seen it put into bottles.\" But when a th ing has been clearly proved and made comprehensible to you, you will no longer believe i t you will know it. In the Bhagavad Gita, c h. ix., it is said, \"I am Immortality and also dea th; and I, 0 Arjuna! am that which is and that which is not.\"[Or , \"which exists negatively.\"] And again (ch. ix.): \"And, 0 descendant of Bharata! see wonde rs in numbers, unseen before. Within my body, 0 Gudakesa! see today the whole universe, inc luding everything moveable and immovable, all in one.\" And again (ibid.) Arjuna sa id: \" 0 Infinite Lord of the Gods! 0 Thou who pervadest the universe! Thou art the Indes tructible, that which is, that which is not, and what is beyond them. Thou art the Primal G od, the Ancient One; T hou art the highest support of this universe. By Thee is this u niverse pervaded, 0 Thou of the infinite forms. . .Thou art of infinite power, of unmeasured glory; T hou pervadest all, and therefore, Thou art all! \" The idea of negative existence can then exist as an idea, but it will not bear definition, since the idea of definition is utterly incompatible with its nature. But, some of my readers will perhaps say, your term negative exi stence is surely a misnomer; the state you describe would be better expressed by the title of negative subsistence. Not so, I answer; for negative subsistence can never be anything but nega tive subsistence; it cannot vary, it cannot develop; for negative subsistence cannot be at all; it never has existed, it never does exist, it never will exist. But negative existence bears hidden in itself, positive life; for in the limitless depths of the abyss of its negativity lie s hidden the power of standing forth from itself, the power of projecting the scintilla of th e thought unto the outer, the power or re- involving the syntagma into the inner. T hus shroude d and veiled is the absorbed intensity in the centerless whirl of the vastness of expansion. Therefore have I employed the term Ex-sto, rather than Sub-sto."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"VOLUME ONE 39 But between two ideas so different as those of nega tive and positive existence a certain n ex us , or co nn ect in g-l i n k, i s req uir ed , a nd h en ce we arri ve at t he for m wh ich is c alle d po ten tial e xist enc e, whi ch whil e mo re ne arl y a p pro ach in g po siti ve ex iste nc e, will st ill scarcely admit of clear definition.

How muc h less, then, will those seeds which that tree in its turn may yield?

And before that idea, and of the idea, I can only say, in the words of an ancient or acle: \"In Him is an illimitable abyss of glory, and from it there goeth forth one little spa rk which maketh all the glory of the sun, and of the moon, and of the stars. Mortal! behold h ow little I know of God; seek not to know more of Him, for this is far beyond thy compre hension, however wise thou art; as for us, who are His mini ster s, h o w s mall a p art are we of Hi m!\" T h ere are th ree q ab alisti cal ve ils of th e n e gative e xi ste nce , an d i n t he ms el ves th e y f or mu late t he hidden ideas of th e Se phir ot h n o t yet cal led i nto b ei n g, a nd t he y ar e c on ce ntrat ed in Ket her, wh ich i n t his se nse is t he Mal kut h of t he h id de n i dea s of t he Sephiroth.

T his wor d c on sist s of t hre e l etters , wh ic h t hu s s ha do w f ort h t he first th ree Sephiroth or numbers. T he second veil is the AIN SV P, Ain Soph, equals Without Limit. And the third veil is AIN SVP AVR, Ain Soph Aur equals the Limitless Light. T his again consists of nine letters, and symbolizes the first nine Sephiroth, but of course in their hidden i dea o nl y. But wh en we re ac h t he n u mb er ni ne we ca n n ot pr o gr ess fa rth er wi th out returning to the unity, or the number one, for the number ten is but a repetition of unity freshly derived from the negative, as is evident fr om a glance at its ordinary representation in Arabic numerals, where the circle 0 represents the Negative, and the 1 the Unity. Thus, then, the limitless ocean of negative light does not proceed from a center, , for it is centerless, but it concentrates a center, which is the number one of the manifested Sephiroth , Kether, the Crown, the First Sephira; which therefore may be sa id to be the Malkuth or number ten of the hidden Sephiroth.

There are ten Sephiroth, which are the most abstract forms of the ten numbers of the decimal scale, i.e., the abstract forms of the ten numbers 1, 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Therefore, as in the higher mathematics we reason of numbers in their abstract senses, so in the Qabalah we reason of the Deity by the abstract forms of the numbers; in other words, by the SPIRVTh, Sephiroth. It was from this ancient Oriental theory that Pythagor as derived his numerical s ymb o li c i dea s. Among these Sephiroth, j ointly and severally, we fi nd the development of the persons and attributes of God. Of these some are male and some are female. Now, for some reason or other best known to themselves, the translators of the Bible have carefully crowded out of existence and smothered up every reference to the f act that the Deity is both masculine and feminine. They have translated a . feminine plural by a masculine singular in the case of the word Elohim. T hey have, however, left an inadvertent adm ission of their knowledge that it was plural in Gen. iv. 26; \"And Elohim said: Let Us mak e man.\" Again (v. 27), how could Adam be made in the image of the Elohim, male and female , unless the Elohim were male a nd f e male al so ? T h e word E lo hi m is a pl ural f or me d fro m t he fe mi nin e sin gu lar ALH, E/oh, by adding IM to the word. But inasmuch as IM is usuall y the termination of the masculine plural, and is here added to a fe minine noun, it gi ves the word Elohi m the sense of a female potency united to a masculine idea, and ther eby capable of producing an offspring. Now, we hear much of the Father and Son, but we hea r nothing of the Mother in th e ord ina r y r eli gi on s of th e da y.

Thus it is a fitting repr esentative of the great unchangeable Father of all. Now this number of unity has a twofold natu re, and thus forms, as it were, the link between the negative and the positive. In its uncha ngeable one-ness it is scarcely a number; but in its property of capability of addition it ma y be called the first number of a numerical series. Now, the zero, 0, is incapable even of addi tion, just as also is negative existence. How, then, if 1 can neither be multiplied nor divided, i s another 1 to be obtained to add to it; in other words, how is the number 2 to be found? By reflection of itself. For though 0 be incapable of definition, 1 is definable. And the effect of a definition is to form an Eidolon, duplicate, or image, of the thing defined. Thus, then, we obta in a duad composed of 1 and its reflection. Now also we have the commencement of a vibration established, for the number 1 vibrates alternately from changelessness to definit ion, and back to changelessness again.

But there is no Sephira ant erior to Kether, nor is there a Sephira which succeeds Malkuth. By these remarks it will be understood how Chokmah is a feminine noun, though marking a masculine Sephira. The connecting-link of the Sephiroth is the Ruach, spirit, from Mezla, the hidden i n f l u e n c e . . . \" Let me leave Mathers' Introduction for a brief mome nt in order to dilate on one of the important topics he dealt with. CONCERNING T HE HIERARCHIES A set of names and ideas which frequently seem to g et mixed up and confused, relates to the hierarchies of intelligent beings of the Sep hiroth, Signs, Planets and Elements. It will become evident, very early in one's study of the Qa balah and the Tree of Life as given in this hook, there is a magical technique for invoking eac h constituent of these hierarchies. This being the case, it is imperative that one's mind be absol utely clear as to the nature of the hierarchy being dealt with, and where it belongs. For example, the first Scphirah is named Kether, the Crown Its divine name is Eheieh, meaning I will be. This is the future tense in Hebrew grammar; its Archangel is Metatron, and its Choir of Angels is t he Chayoth ha-Qadosh, and its Palace in"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 44 Assiah is Rashith ha-Gilgaleem. Each one of these h ierarchical names refers also to one of the four Qabalistic worlds. The first to ATZ ILUTH -- the Archetypal World. The second to BRIAH -- the Creative World. T he third to YET ZIRAH -- the Formative World -- and ASSIAH is the World of Action or Manifestation. These names should certainly be committed to memory . One means of ensuring this is to draw a good copy of the Tree of Life on a ful l sheet of typing paper, and run off a couple of dozen or more xerox copies. Then each set of cor respondences can simply be copied on one of the duplicated Trees, enabling one to see at a glance the associations, inferences, etc. Now one of the attributions to Kether is Air, prima l Air. The element Air has its own hierarchy as follows: The divine Name is given as Shaddai El Chai, its Archangel is Raphael, its Angel is Chassan, the Ruler is Ariel, and the King is Paralda. Actually this set of attributions should belong lower down on the Tree t han Kether, undoubtedly in Yesod. But I will deal with that later. For the time being, however, consider the fact that this hierarchical relation to Air is also attributed to Kether, the Crown. It would be a gross misunderstanding of Qabalistic principles to confuse the individual members of eac h hierarchy with the other, as is commonly done. Metatron, the Archangel of Kether, h as nothing whatsoever to do with the element Air. Nor has the Archangel Raphael, who rul es over the element Air, anything whatsoever to do with K ether. Much the same is tru e of the remaining members of the hierarchy. Each one must be considered separately a nd individually. T here must be no confusion. (This is clarified on one of our G.D. ta pes). Take Geburah, another example. It is the 5th Sephir ah on the Tree, and to it is referred the planet Mars and the element of Fire (r eflected downwards from Chokmah. See the chart which depicts the reflection of the three elements downwards and crosswise on the Tree.) T hat means, apart from other more compli cated features (if one considers them as complications), there are three entirely separat e hierarchies. One for Geburah. Another for Mars, and yet a third for Fire. Each must be kept s eparate from the other. The divine name for Geburah is Elohim Gibor. The Ar changel is Kamael, and the Choir of Angels is Seraphim, and its Assiatic Palac e is Mars, Maadim. Now the hierarchy for Mars is of course Elohim Gibo r, but the Angel is Zamael, the Intelligence is Graphiel, and its Spirit is Bartzab el. T hese two sets of hierarchical names bear absolutely no relationship with one another. T hey must be kept in separate watertight compartments in one's brain, so that any one name o f any one hierarchy does not leak over and create confusion in the other hierarchy. I repe at and am most emphatic on this score, for even some of the better authorities fall into this booby-trap, which is dug for the unwary. T his warning could be reiterated frequently and sho uld be printed on every few pages in the student's own notebooks, so that it serves as an ev er present reminder -- keep the hierarchies separate! One may not say that Mars is Geburah. Mar s has its own"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"VOLUME ONE 45 hierarchy which is separate from that of Geburah. W e may say that among the many attributions given to Geburah, and they are manifol d, one of them and only one is Mars. So since the part is not greater than the whole, Mars with its o wn particular kinds of attributions occupies a less er space than the category of Geburah in which it is i ncluded. The problem for the novice and the so-called advanc ed student is that there is another set of attributions to Geburah with another hierarchy alto gether. For example in common parlance the student may say Geburah is Fire. This is not true! Fire is but another one of the attributions to Gebu rah in the same category as is Mars. And just as Mars has its own hierarchy so also does the element of Fire. The hierarchy of Fire again must not be confused wi th the hierarchy of Mars or that of Geburah. The element of Fire diagonally reflected down the T ree from the Sephirah Chokmah, has its own hierarchy which is totally distinct and separat e from the preceding two. For instance its divine name is Yhvh Tzabaoth (which more or less links it to Netzach), while the Archangel is Michael, the King is Aral. (He must not be confused with the Rul er of Air Ariel, nor with Auriel who is the Archangel of Earth). The King of Fire is Seraph (no t to be confused with the Seraphim who are the Choir of Angels of Geburah), and its Ruler is Djin. I know of countless numbers of students throughout the years who have never mastered this particular set of attributions and hopelessly confu se one with the other. The result is a hodge-podge of attributions, none of which make sense and then to excuse their confusion and lack of true understanding of semantic principles they begin to talk of \"blinds\" in the teaching. There is another point here that must be referred t o. For example: Raphael is the Archangel of Air. The Archangel of Tiphareth is also Raphael. The Angel of Mercury is also Raphael. Now is this the same \"person \" or are they different beings? From the practical magical point of view, when invo king any one of these beings, the divine Name used will be quite different and of course the Pentagram or the Hexagram will be different too. The intention is altogether different; this is a si gnificant factor that will differentiate results. T he Archangel of Air is invoked by the Air Pentagram. T he Archangel of Tiphareth will be invoked by a Hexagram of the Sun, as will the Angel of Mercury b y the Hexagram of Hod. That disposes of the practical aspect. But there is a more metaphysical topic involved, wh ich I think is quite interesting and intriguing. V.H. Frater S.R.M.D. attempted in one o f the Enochian papers to deal distantly with this problem, but I do not think the discussion came to a satisfactory conclusion, nor do I think the problem was solved. The way in which one may look at it is to consider a country where many people have similar names. Smith for example, is one of these found in England, Schmidt in Germany, or Collins or Williams, etc., in Wales, etc. Let us deal with Wal es. In a fairly large town in Wales there is going to be a Mr. Williams who is the dairyman. Then there w ill be Mr."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 46 Williams who has the dry-goods store. I knew a Mr. Williams who was a gardener when once, years ago, I lived in St. Briavels on th e Welsh border. And there ought to be a Mr. Williams, the groceryman. All are Williams. Are they the same person because they have the same name? Obviously not, though having th e same surname, their first or Christian names would be different and so would their vocatio ns. In much the same way we can distinguish the Archang els and Angels we are talking about. One of them is in the hierarchy of Air - a d ifferent kind of profession as it were. Another is in T iphareth, and the third relates to t he planet Mercury. There is no earthly connection between any of these, despite the fact t hey have the same name. Correspondingly, the divine Names of these three areas is also different . So to call them, or to call upon them, we must know what sphere of action they operate in and act accordingly. They are in effect different \"people,\" different names and use differe nt \"tools\" as it were. We will also have to learn to differentiate between the element of Air attributed to Kether, that attributed to Tiphareth, and that attr ibuted to Yesod. The first we can call, merely to provide understandable labels, Celestial Air. T o invoke, one should use the divine Name of Kether first before using the hierarchical names belonging to the element of Air. In the case of Tiphareth, we could use the term Divine Air (or even Harmonious Air), using the divine name of Tiphareth first before those of the element of Air. T he Air attributed to Yesod could be entitled j ust Elemental Air, and use d with the hierarchical names as given. T he same rationale must be used with the elements o f Fire attributed to Chokmah, Geburah and Netzach - Celestial Fire, Divine Fire, and Elemental Fire. Water - we use rather the same procedure. It is att ributed to Binah, Chesed, and Hod - Celestial Water, Divine Water, and Elemental Water, with the same changes in the use of divine names as given above. This procedure will el iminate a great deal of confusion and muddle.

In each of the three trinities or triads o f the Sephiroth is a duad of opposite sexes, and uniting intelligence wh ich is the result. In this, the masculine and feminine potencies are regarded as the two scal es of the balance, and the uniting Sephira as the beam which joins them. T hus, then, the term balance may be said to symbolize the Triune, Trinity in Unity, and the Unity represented by the central point of the beam. But again, in the Sephiroth there is a triple Trinity, the upper, lower, and middle. Now, these three are represented thus: the Supernal, or highes t, by the Crown, Kether; the middle by athe King, and the inferior by the Queen; which will be the greatest trinity. And the earthly correlatives of these will be the Primum Mobile, th e Sun and the Moon. Here we at once find alchemical symbolism. Now in the world the Sephiroth are represented by: (1)RAShITh HGLGLIM, Rashith Ha-Galgalim, the commencement of the whirling motions, the Primum Mobile (2)MSLVT h, Masloth, the sphere of the Zodiac. (3)ShBThAI, Shabbathai, rest, Saturn. (4)T zDQ, Tzadeq,, righteousness, Jupiter (5)MADIM, Madim,, vehement strength, Mars. (6)ShMSh, Shemesh, the solar light, the Sun.

(10)ChLM ISVDVTh, Cholorn Yesodoth, the breaker of the foundations, the elements. T he Sephiroth are further divided into three pillar s the right-hand Pillar of Mercy, consisting of the second, fourth, and seventh emana tions; the left-hand Pillar or Judgment, consisting of the third, fifth, and eighth; and the middle Pillar of Mildness, consisting of the first, sixth, ninth, and tenth emanations. In their totality and unity the ten Sephiroth repre sent the archetypal man, ADM QDMVN, Adam Kadmon, the Protogonos. In looking to the Sephiroth constit uting the first triad, it is evident that they represent the intell ect; and hence this triad is called the intellectual world, OV LM M VShK L, Olahm Mevshekal. The second triad corresponds to the moral world, OVLM MVRGSh, Olahm Morgash. T he third represents power and stability, and is therefore called the material world, OVLM HM VT BO, Olahm Ha-Mevethau. These three aspects are called the faces, AN PIN, Anpin. Thus is the tree of life, OT z ChIIM, Ot: Chaiim, formed; the first triad being placed above, the sec ond and third below, in such a manner that the three masculine Sephiroth are on th e right, three feminine"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"VOLUME ONE 53 on the left, whilst the four uniting Sephiroth occu py the center. This is the qabalistical Tree of Life, on which all things depend. There is considerable a nalogy between this and the tree Yggd rasi l of the Sc an din a vi an s. I have already remarked that there is one trinity w hich comprises all the Sephiroth, and that it consists of the Crown, the King, and th e Queen. (In some senses this is similar to the Christian Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spir it, which in their highest divine nature are symbolized by the first three Sephiroth, Kether , Chokmah, and Binah.) It is the Trinity which created the world, or, in qabalistic language , the universe was born from the union of the crowned King and Queen. But according to the Qa balah, before the complete form of the heavenly man (the ten Sephiroth) was produced, there were certain primordial worlds created, but these could not subsist, as the equili brium of balance was not yet perfect, and they were convulsed by the unbalanced forces and de stroyed. These primordial worlds are called the kings of ancient time, and the kings of Edom who reigned before the monarchs of Is rael. In t his s en se, Ed o m i s th e worl d of u nba lan ce d for c e , an d Is ra el is th e ba lan ce d Sephiroth (Gen. xxxvi. 31).

Now the Sephiroth are also called the World of Eman ations, or the Atziluthic World, or archetypal world, OVLM AT zILVT h, Olahm Atziloth; and this world gave birth to three other worlds, each containing a repetition of the S ephiroth, but in a descending scale of b ri ghtn es s. T he second world is the Briatic world, OVLM HBRIAH, Olahm Ha-Briah, the world of creation, also called KVRSIA, Khorsia, the throne. It is an immediate emanation from the world of Atziluth, whose ten Sephiroth are reflecte d herein, and are consequently more limited, though they are still of the purest nature , and without any admixture of matter.

Thus he is depicted as an angry and violent God - which is what the four elements of life are.

Therefore when a devout Jew comes upo n it in reading the Scripture, he either does not attempt to pronounce it, but instead makes a short pause, or else he substitutes for it the name Adonai, ADNI, Lord. The radical meaning of the word is \"to be,\" and it is thus, like AHIH, Eheieh, a glyph of existence. It is capable o f twelve transpositions, which all convey the meaning of \"to be\"; it is the only word that will bear so many transpositions without its meaning being altered. They are called the twelve banners of the mighty name, and are said by some to rule the twelve signs of the Zo diac. These are the twelve banners: IHV H, IHHV, IV HH, HV HI, HV IH, HHIV, V HHI, V IHH, V HI H, HIHV, HIV H, H HVI.

Closely associated with the subj ect of the letters of the T etragra mmat on is that of the four Kerubim, to which I have already referred in describing the first Sephira. Now it must not be forgotten that these forms in E ze kiel's vision support the throne of the Deity, whereon the Heavenly Man is seated - the Adam Qadmo n, the Sephirotic image; and that between the throne and the living creatures is the firmament. Here then we have the four worlds - Atziloth, the deific form; Briah, the thro ne; Yetzirah, the firmament; Assiah, the Kerubim. Therefore the Kerubim represent the powers of the letters of the Tetragrammaton on the material plane; and the four represent the oper ation of the four letters in each of the four worlds. Thus, then, the Kerubim are the living form s of the letters, symbolized in the Zodiac by T aurus, Leo, Aquarius, and Scorpio, as I ha ve be fore re mar ked. And the mystery of the earthly and mortal man is af ter the mystery of the supernal and immortal One; and thus was he created in the im age of God upon earth.

The one is A H II-I, Eheieh; the o ther is the V, Vau, of the Tetragrammaton. The first two letters, I and H, Yod and He, are the Father and Mother of Microprosopus, and the H final is his Bride. But in these forms is expressed the equilibrium of Severity and Mercy; Severity being symbolized by th e two Hehs, the Mother and the Bride, but especially by the latter. But while the excess of Mercy is not an evil tendency, but rather conveys a certain idea of weakness and want of force, too great an excess of Severity calls forth the executioner of judgment, the evil a nd oppresive force which is symbolized by Leviathan.

What is really necessary to this end is to acquire sufficient knowledge clearly to follow the explanations and instructions given in the succ essive Grades so that the Candidate does not become unduly bewildered in his endeavors to gr asp the meaning through ignorance of the technical expressions employed for that purpose . It is to aid in this comprehension that the so-call ed \"Knowledge Lectures\" exist as apart from those termed \"Side-Lectures\"; these latt er, though not necessarily required to be committed to memory, contain important and interest ing matter peculiar to each grade. The \"Knowledge Lectures\" contained just the amount of c arefully sifted out knowledge necessary not only to pass the examination for such and such Grade, but also fairly well to comprehend and follow the Ceremonial Ritual of the Grade itself. Such knowledge then may seem and perhaps is slightly more amplified tha n a bare pass in the examination might demand. But it is to the student's own interest to learn as thoroughly as he can what is given. Our subject of study is inexhaustible for it is the Universe itself whose Mysteries we seek to fathom by the aid of that Secret System of Correspondences and Formulas, the especial knowledge of our Order the Keys of the Wis dom of all Time. Our Grades therefore form the ladder which aids us to mount towards this end, a ladder in which not one rung is wanting neither is there a Lacune. We appeal to the soul by the secret formulas hidden in our Ceremonies; to the mind by the special studies of the Order, to the body by the Stations and movements in the Temple and to the whole being by the combinations of these. Now it must be taken into consideration that many o f our members, and those very good ones, have but limited time to devote to the w ork and studies of the Order owing to the exigencies and occupations of their daily life; and this, though at first sight a drawback, is in reality not so much so as it appears, for on the one side our studies are so different from the ordinary business conditions and avocations of exis tence that it is a fresh interest and repose of the mind to come to them and on the other hand it avoids the excessive nerve strain and consequent want of mental balance, frequ ently induced by too continuous an application to psychic and occult experiments and p ractices, whether theoretical or practical.

T hey are far less diffic ult than they look. T hr first impression usually produced on the Neophyte may be thus expressed Oh! I've got to learn Hebrew, and become a grammatical Hebrew scholar. He is only asked to learn the Hebrew alphabet, that is to say the proper shapes and mean ings of its letters together with their numerical values, and in the case of the Ten Sephir oth (or Ten Divine Emanations corresponding to the ten numbers of the decimal sca le) and of some names chiefly Divine and Angelic; their exact orthography as well: the w hich is a very different thing to becoming a critical student of Hebrew. Of course sh ould any Frater or Soror have the time and inclination to make a thorough study of the Heb rew language there is nothing to prevent them so doing, but this is in no sense necessary ei ther to pass the Examinations for the Grades or follow the technicalities of the Rituals. For our object is not to make the Aspirant a critical grammatical Hebrew scholar but gradually a profound Mystic and Magician. T he same reasoning applies to Alchemy, As trology, Egyptology, etc., all of which subjects are touched upon in the various know ledge lectures. It rests with the Aspirant to choose if and how he will apply later the basal knowledge so gained. For it is the science of correspondences he is studying the whole time, w hether between the Divine Powers and the Universe, between these and man, or between the se again and the different planes and developments in the life of Nature. The best way to learn the forms of the Hebrew Lette rs, as well as those of the Astrological characters, etc., is to take from four to seven at a time and copy them repeatedly and as exactly as you can, until you kno w them: in the case of the Hebrew always putting the number beside the letter, so as to associate the two together in your mind. Remember that the Hebrew letters should be always w ritten broad and strong, the horizontals being thick, and the perpendiculars thin, as in mus ic copying just the contrary of the ordinary Roman letter, and as square as possible. It may be wondered why the Hebrew Alphabet seems to have been so specially selected, rather than any other. For these reasons: Not necessarily because it is Hebrew; though the circumstance of the Qabalah (which conta ins so large a part of the ancient Egyptian wisdom) being written in that language, co nfers a certain special value upon it. And the mysteries of the Qabalah form a most import ant part of our studies. But the Hebrew unites in itself certain notable peculiarities and qualities expressed in its Alphabet, to a much greater extent than is usually found in other and more familiar alphabets of the European group. For (a) contrary to our practise, i t has not a set of numerals which singly or combined express numbers, but each letter itself has a numerical value. When thus employed as numbers or as an initial letter put for the whole word itself, two little dashes are placed above it to shew that it is used in that sen se: thus the initial for the name of the Sephira Netzach, for the number 50 etc., (b) It is an entirely consonantal Alphabet. It then results from the combination of (a) and (b) that ev ery word is a number, and conversely again that most numbers are words: which affords a method of comparison between words having the same number and is used in the Qabalah. (In the Hebrew Q does not require a"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"VOLUME ONE 61 \" u \" to follow it, and it is pronounced like an acce nted or \"coughed\" (very slightly of course) K. (c) Every letter, besides its power has an especial name with a meaning attached to it, thus allying it with a Hieroglyphic Idea, e.g., pow er M, name Mem, meaning Water. (d) With us each letter has further its Sphere of Mystical Sign ifications so that any important Hebrew word becomes as it were a phrase rather than a word. Bes ides other developments which unfold themselves later. The Neophyte should remember that Hebrew is always written from right to left, while in English, French, German, etc., it is just the oppos ite. A point that very generally puzzles the Neophyte is the apparent extreme arbitrariness of the Hebrew Orthography, so that to him it appears ( though it is not really so) as if in some cases a letter were needlessly put in, and in others erro neously omitted. The following explanation is given to thoroughly clear up this point by giving t he reason for this apparent uncertainty but none of these or the foregoing observations are int ended to be learned by heart, they are merely given to make difficult points more clear. Hebrew is a Semitic and not an European language. N ow the great distinguishing characteristic of the Semitic group such as Hebrew, Chaldaic, Arabic, Ethiopic, etc., is that the Alphabet consists entirely of consonants; even thos e letters which appear to have a vowel power, as in the Hebrew not being absolutely what we in Eu ropean languages know as vowels. Thus is rather a drawing in of the breath like the syllable Ah, than the vowel A is H or EH, or He according to position. Certainly not the vowel E. V is much more than U; Y nearer I, NG, or AA or HAA, something like the neigh of a horse or the bleat of a goat, rather than O. In What You Should Know About the Golden Dawn, I once expressed some criticisms of the general attitudes prevailing in the Order. Of d oing just enough work to pass the appropriate examination to be promoted to a higher grade. This really was the curse of the early Order. From the paper, it would appear that Mathers was as resp onsible for this viewpoint as anyone. On the whole, I have great respect for Mathers for as this book indicates, he was the author with Westcott of most of the Initiatory Rituals, and mos t of the magical instructions. But in this particular respect he was the inadvertent promoter of this attitude which, in my estimation, brought incalculable harm to the Order, permitted essential ly unworthy candidates to be wrongly advanced to higher grades for which they were basically unre ady.

FRATER A.M.A.G. The stud y of the different types of divination ma y seem difficult to understand in an Order which purported to teach met hods of spiritual development. Many will no doubt be rather perplexed by this. Div ination usually is said to refer exclusively to the low occult arts. Actually, howev er, so far as the Order is concerned, the principal object for these practical methods is that they stimlulate, as few exercises can, the faculties of imagination, in tuition and clairvo yance. Though certain readings or interpretations to the G eomantic and Tarot symbols ma y be found in the appropriate parts of th is text, these rule of thumb methods do not conduce to the production of an accu rate delineation of the spiritual causes behind material events. These interpretation s are usual to the beginner in the art, for he requires a foundation of the principal definitions employed upon which his own meditations can build. These textual delineatio ns serve in actual practice only as a base for the working of the inner faculties, p rovides for them a thrust block, as it were from which they ma y \"kick-off.\" In short, t he effort to divine by these methods calls into operation the intuitive and imag inative faculties to a very large extent. Everyone without exception has this faculty of divining in some degree, varying only in his ability to make it manifest. I n most people it is wholly dormant. Again, while divination as an artificial process ma y be wholl y unnecessar y and a hindrance to the refined perceptions of a ful l y developed Adept who requires no such convention to ascertain whence a thing come s and whither it is going, yet these aids and stimuli have their proper place for the Neophyte. For those in training they are not only legitimate but useful and necessa r y."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 2 It may be interesting for the reader to attempt to acquire intuitive knowledge on any matter without the divinatory aids first, an d it will be seen how extremely difficult it is to get started, to pick upon any on e fact or incident which shall act as a prompt or a start of the interior mechanism. Having failed in this way, let him see how much further he really may go by the judicious and sensible use of one of the Order methods. There is no doubt that the opening of the mind to an intuitive perception is considerably aided by these methods. And this is pa rticularly true with regard to the rather lengthy Tarot method which was given to the initiate while engaged in the fulfilment of his Adeptus Minor curriculum. Like al l magical techniques, divination is open to abuse. This fact, however, that abuse is possible does not, as again and again must be reiterated, condemn the abused techni que. The application of common sense to the magical art is as necessary as it is t o all else. Originally, Astrology was taught as part of the reg ular routine. All instruction on this subject seems now to have been thoroughly e xtirpated from the Order papers. In this particular instance, the omission is just a s well. Recent years have seen a great deal of meticulous attention paid to this stu dy by sincere and honest researchers, and many first rate books have been published expla ining its intricacies. All that the Order demands of the Adeptus Minor is that he shoul d understand the underlying principles of this science and be able to draw up a map showing the position of Planets and Signs preparatory to certain operations requiring the invocation of planetary and zodiacal forces. So far as the general topic of divination is concer ned, the Outer Order had very little to say. The formal teaching of Astrology was abandoned because, as stated above, the market was now replete with many fine wo rks on the subject, and thus there was really no need to teach what was readily available. 1 he Tarot technique that it recommended was the Ce ltic method, a ten card layout popularized by A. E. Waite in his P i c t o r i a l K e _ i ' t o t h e T a r o t from which later writers have drawn extensively. The method is very simple and direct; thus its advantage to the student in the Outer Order. It had however one major disadvantage. There was no way to determine whether any one parti cular card in the layout was well aspected or otherwise. Under these circumstances, t he novice diviner would be most likely to pick out the most favorable interpretatio n to suit his fancy. The Golden Dawn method, as taught in the Inner Order, was a ho rse of another color, having a superb method of aspecting each card to be read. The Celtic or Gypsy method, as it is called in the Leigh Gardner papers, has been made useful by resort to a simple device. As o ne shuffles the pack in order to infiltrate it with one's own magnetism or aura, it is a good idea to drop a card periodically. When inserting it back into the deck, make sure it is replaced upside down. Or, half the number of cards in a deck may be deliberately pulled out at random, turned upside down and then inserted back i nto the pack. Then shuffle very thoroughly to make sure they are randomly well dist ributed. The notion involved here is that the upside down po sition provides the basis for the negative reading of some of the cards as th ey turn up in the divination.

The other method was Geomancy, divination by earth. A complete treatise was given to the Practicus - that is in the Outer Order of the Golden Dawn. Years after the Revolt which all but annihilated the Order, McGrego r Mathers and Brodie Innes reconstituted one o: the Temples in the North of En gland (from which it spread even to the United States) and named it the A.O. an abbr eviation for the Alpha and Omega. It was the direct continuation of the Golden Dawn under the new name. It continued to use the instruction papers originally written for the Golden Dawn, but some new ones were added. One of these was a paper on Geomancy. From it I have extrapolated some notes of significant material, an d added it to the basic text.

THE TAROT By S TUART R. KAP LA N \"There exist today several fifteenth-century Viscon ti-Sforza tarocchi decks which comprise the earliest known tarot cards. The reproduction in 1975 of the most complete of these packs - the Pierpont Morgan-Berga mo tarocchi deck whose original cards are divided between the P ierpont Morgan Libra r y, Ne w York, and the Accademia Carrara and Colleoni family, Bergamo, Ita ly - is an important event for tarot collectors and researchers of art history. Italy holds the honor of having produced several of the earliest known tarocchi packs that contain the mystical and allegorical tru mp cards. Throughout five centuries the provocative symbolism of the twenty-t wo Major Arcana cards has continued to intrigue art historians, artists and o ccultists. For over five hundred years card designers and artists have faithfullly preserv ed the same dominant symbolism of the Major Arcana cards while often adding their per sonal interpretations in the form of slight modifications to the designs"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 4 based upon the fashions, events and important topic s of the day. There exist in leading museums, libraries and private collectio ns many hundreds of such modified tarot designs, the work of such artists as the fifteenth-century genius Bonifacio Bembo, modern painters such as Salvador D ali and Larry Rivers, and many lesser known but talented artists such as P amela Co leman S mith (Rider-W aite pack), Lad y Frieda Harris (Crowle y Thoth cards), Fergus Hall (James Bond 007 tarot cards), David P alladini (Aquarian tarot) and Domeni co Balbi (Balbi pack). 1 he development of tarot symbolism during the last five centuries, beginning with the earliest known Italian tarocchi cards, is an intriguing stor y. TERMINO LOGY The term trionfi was used in Ital y in the fifteenth centur y to descr ibe the twenty-two Major Arcana cards. The term tarocchi subsequently came into usage in Italy in the early sixteenth century, first referri ng to the twenty-two Major Arcana cards, and thereafter to the complete sevent y-eight -card deck, consisting of the twenty-two Major Arcana and fift y-six Minor Arcana or suit cards. The words tarocchi and tarocco are often used interchangeabl y, although tarocchi is actuall y the plural of tarocco. Tarot, the French derivative of tarocchi, has come into widespread usage in the English language. In pronouncing the w ord tarot, the final t is silent. MacGregor Mathers, writing in 1888, describes sever al anagrams derived from the word taro: Tora - law (Hebrew) Troa - gate (Hebrew) Rota - wheel (Latin) Orat - it speaks, argues or entreats (Latin) Taor o r Taur - Egyptian goddess of darkness Ator or Athor - Egyptian Hathor goddess of joy. The term trumps is derived from the Latin triumphi. The twenty-two trump cards, also known as the Major Arcana or Greater Ar cana cards, each contain a s ymbolic or allegorical picture. Arcana is a Latin word meaning mysterious or secret; the Italian word arcana, derived from the L atin, has the same meaning. The trumps are also known as at outs in French and atutti in Italian. Atouts denote cards of higher value than the rest, that is, a tous or a tu tti, superior to all others. Some researchers believe the word tarot derives fro m the term tarotee, the name applied to the design on the back of earl y car ds - a multiple series of crisscrossing solid or dotted lines in varying widt hs. However, it is likely that the word tarotee itself was derived from tarocchi since the use of the word tarocchi predates that of the word tarotee. In the statutes of the guild of card makers of Paris in the year 1594 the cartiers called themselves tarotiers, another form of the word tarot."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 5 The origins of playing cards - both the twenty-two Major Arcana and the fifty- six suited cards - remain obscure. An early pack of suited cards - perhaps the earliest extant deck - is the hand-painted German \"Hunting\" pack of Stuttgart, which dates from about 1420-1430 and contains no trumps. These cards depict a hunting series with dogs, stags, ducks and falcons for suit signs. The earliest Visconti-Sforza tarocchi cards also date from this period. The following are some of the popular theories advanced during the past several centuries regardin g the possible origin of tarocchi cards. P REHIS TOR IC MAN AND ORAL CU LTURES Prior to recorded history, prehistoric man develope d various systems of oral culture and tradition based upon a subtle knowledge of astronom y and calendric counters. It is generally believed that early man c arefully observed the sidereal phases of the day, month and year, and the changing positions of the planets. These were astronomical events he could easily study and he recorded these events by calendric counters such as markings on a stretched piece of animal hide, engravings or scratchings on a bone, and notches on a tree bra nch. Important cultural events were eventuall y ex pressed in metaphorical and alleg orical forms as m yths, legends and fables, which were verbally transmitted from ge neration to generation over periods of time extending many thousands and even t ens of thousands of years. Some fragments of these early oral traditions survi ved into recorded time in the form of popular m yths and beliefs. For ex ample, the devil is an antlered figure associated with sorcery and evil, and the hermit is a hooded figure holding a candle and representing the winter solstice. Both these fi gures are found in the Major Arcana of the tarot pack. Many of the pictorial images on the Major Arcana cards have been distorted b y time and the ignorance of their interp reters. Thus, most tarot pictures as popularized during the past five hundred years are unrecogniz able in terms of earl y m yths and oral culture. Literal interpretations of man y earl y m yths are the basis of numerous superstitions and ceremonies practiced tod a y b y religious groups, fraternal orders, secret societies and followers of the occult. Some scholars including Arthur Corwin, who has been researching the subject since the 1960's, view the allegorical symbolism of tarot cards as pictorial metaphors that express the preoccupation of early man with th e task of timekeeping. The calendar was an important point of reference to ear l y man. He kept accurate records of the celestial changes that occurred on a daily, monthly and annual basis. He observed the precession of the equinox, the astrono mical motions of the stars and planets, and other repetitive events. The calendar was used as a means of survival, including planning for winter food storage, prepari ng necessary shelter, communicating on a daily basis with other human bei ngs and recording the length of time required for b i r t h . . . \""},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 6 A GYPSY METHOD OF TAROT DIVINATION This mode of Tarot Divination is the most suitable for obtaining rapidily an answer to a definite question. The Diviner selects a card to represent the person or matter about which he enquires. This card is called the Significator, and should he wish to ascertain something in connection with himself, he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A King represents a man of 40 years and upwards. A Knight represents any male under that age. A Queen a woman of 40 years an d upwards. A Knave a young man or woman. The Four Court Cards: Wands represent very fair people with yellow or aub urn hair, fair complexion, blue eyes. Cups have light brown or dull hair with grey or blu e eyes. Swords have hazel or gre y e yes, and dark brown hair and dull complexions. Pentacles have very dark brown or black hair, dark eyes and sallow or swarthy complexions. You can be guided on occasion by the known temperam ent of a person. One who is exceedingly dark may be energetic and would be better represented by a Sword card than a Pentacle. On the other hand a ver y fair subject who is indolent and lethargic should be referred to Cups in place of Wa nds. If it is a matter about which an enquiry is to be made, the Significator should b e a Trump or small card which bears some relationship to the matter. Suppose that the question is \"Will a lawsuit be nec essary?\" In this case, take the Trump card \"Justice\" as the significator since it has reference to legal matters. But if the question is \"Shall I be successful in my law suit? \" one of the Court Cards representing yourself should be selected. Subsequen tly consecutive divinations can be performed to ascertain the course of the process it self, and its result to each of the parties concerned. Having selected the Significator, place it on the t able face upwards, then shuffle well and thoroughly the rest of the cards, cutting three times after each shuffle. Lastly, keeping the face of the cards downwards, turn up th e top or front card of the pack and cross the significator with it, and say: 1. This card covers him. This card gives the influence which is affecting th e person or matter of the enquiry generally, the atmosphere in which the ethe r current moves. Turn up the second card and sa y:"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 7 2. This crosses him. It shows the nature of the obstacles in the matter. If this is a favorable card, the opposing forces will not be serious, or it may indi cate that something good in itself will be productive of good in this particular connection . Turn up the third card and say: 3. This crowns him. It represents first, the Querent's aims or ideals i n the matter. And second, the best that can be achieved under the circumstances b ut that which has not yet been made actuality. Turn up the fourth card, place it b elow the Significator, and say: 4. This is beneath him. It shows the foundation or b asis of the matter, that which has already passed into actuality and wh ich the Significator has made his own. Turn up the fifth card and say: 5. This is behind him. It gives the influence that has just past or is pas sing away. If the Significator is a Trump card or a card that cannot be said to face either way, the diviner must decide beforehand which side of the Significator he will take as facing. Usually this fifth card is placed on the right hand side of the Significator, as it will be found that most of the court cards are looking towards the lef t hand. Anyhow, if you decide to always adopt the plan it will be found satisfactory - only make a rule always to do so. Turn up the sixth card, place it on the side that t he Significator is facing and say: 6. This is before him. It shows the influence that is coming into action a nd will operate in the near future. The next four cards are turned up in succes sion and placed in a line by the side of the others which are in the form of a cross. 7. This is himself. This signifies the person himsel f or else the thing enquired about, and shows its position or attitude in the matter. 8. The eighth card represent his House. This is his environment, and the tendencies at work there which have an effect on th e matter - for instance, his position in life, the influence of immediate friend s and so forth. 9. The ninth card gives his hopes and fears in matte r. 10. The tenth card the final result. It is the culmination which is brought about by the influence shown by the other cards that have been turned up in the divinat ion. The operation is now complete. If in any divination the tenth card should be a court card it shows that the subject of the divinat ion falls ultimately into the hands of a person"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 8 represented by the court card and its end depends m ainly on him. In this case, it is possible to have a fresh divination taking the c ourt card as the Significator to discover what is the nature of his influence in the matter, and to what issue he will bring it. Great facility may be obtained by this method in a short time, allowance being made for the gifts of the operator, that is to say his faculty of insight, latent or developed, and besides which it is free from all co mplications. Upon looking up Waite's Pictorial Key to the Tarot, I find that a good deal of the above is extrapolated almost verbatim from that book. However a great deal of important information about this method is presente d in Eden Gra y's book A Complete Guide to the Tarot. NOTES ON THE TAROT By G.H. FRATER S .R.M.D. (N.B. This paper was lent me some years ago by Mr. Stuart Kaplan of U.S. Games Systems, Inc. This is to acknowledge m y gr atitude. I.R.) In the Tree of Life in the Tarot, each path forms t he connecting link between two of the Sephiroth. The King and the Queen are th e correlations of the ABBA and the AIMA in that suit; the Knight or Prince answers to Microprosopus, and the Page or Princess which was anciently a female figure, is referred to the Bride, Kallah or Malkah.

She is crowned with the Lun ar Crescent of Isis and holds in her hands, two wands. Her legs form a cross. She is the Bride of the Apocalypse, the Kabbalistic Queen of the Canticles, the Egyptian Is is or Great Feminine Kerubic Angel Sandalphon on the left hand of the Merc y S eat of the Ark. The wands are the directing forces of the positive and negative currents. The S even Pointed Heptagram or Star alludes to the Seve n Palaces of Assiah; the crossed legs to the s ymbol of the Four Letters of the Name. The surmounting crescent receives alike the influen ces of Geburah and Gedulah. She is the s ynthesis of the 32nd Path, uni ting Malkuth to Yesod. The oval of the 72 smaller circles refers to the Sc hem ha-mephorasch, or Seventy- two fold Name of the Deit y. The twelve large circle s form the Zodiac. At the angles are the Four Kerubim which are the vivified powers of the Name Yod He Vau He operating in the Elements, through which you have j ust symbolically passed in the preceding Ceremony. The Fan, Lamp, Cup and Salt represent the four Elem ents themselves whose inhabitants are the S ylphs, S alamanders, Undines an d Gnomes. The magical title of this trump is The Great One of the Night of Time. 20th KEY-JUDGMENT Before you upon the altar is the Twentieth Ke y of t he Tarot, which s ymbolicall y represents these ideas. To the uniniti ated eye it apparently represents The Last Judgment with an angel blowing a trumpet a nd the dead rising from their tombs - but its meaning is far more occult and reco ndite than this, for it is a gl yph of the powers of Fire. The Angel encircled by the rainbow, whence leap cor ruscations of Fire, and crowned with the Sun, represents Michael, the Great Archangel, the Ruler of S olar Fire. The Serpents which leap in the rainbow are symbols of the Fiery Seraphim. The Trumpet represents the influence of the Spirit desc ending from Binah, while the Banner with the Cross refers to the Four Rivers of P aradise and the Letters of the Hol y Name. He is also Axieros, the first of the S amothracian K abiri, as well as Zeus and Osiris. The left hand figure below, rising from the Earth i s Samael, the Ruler of Volcanic Fire. He is also Axiokersos, the Second Ka bir, P luto and T yphon. The right hand figure below is Anael, the Ruler of Astral Light. She is also Axiokersa, the Third Kabir, Ceres, and Persephone, Isis, and Nephthys. She is, therefore, represented in duplicate form, and risin g from the waters. Around both of these figures dart flashes of Lightening."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 14 The three principle figures form the Fire Triangle, and further represent Fire operating in the other Three Elements of Earth, Air, and Wate r. The central lower figure with his back turned, and his arms in the sign of the Two equals Nine, is Arel, the Ruler of latent heat. He is rising from the Earth as if to receive the properties of the other three. He is also Kasimillo s, the Candidate in the Samothracian Mysteries, and the Horus of Egypt. He rises from th e rock-hewn cubical Tomb and he also alludes to the Candidate who traverses the Path of Fire. The three lower figures represent the letter Shin, to which Fire is especially referred. The seven Hebrew Yods allude to the Sephiroth operating in each of the Planets and to t he Schem-hamphoresch. The magical title is The Spirit of the Primal Fire. 19th KEY-THE SUN Before you upon the Altar is the Nineteenth Key of Tarot which symbolically resumes these ideas. The Sun has twelve principal rays whic h represent the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. They are alternately waved and salient as s ymbolising the alternation of the masculine and feminine natures. These again are sub divided into 36 Decanates or sets of ten degrees in the Zodiac, and these again into 72, typ ifying the 72 quinances or sets of five, and the 72-fold name of Schem ha-mephorasch. Thus the Sun e mbraces the whole creation in its rays. The seven Hebrew Yods on each side, falling through the air, refer to the Solar influence descending. The Wall is the Circle of the Zodiac, and the stones are its various degrees and divisions. The two children standing respectively on the Water and Earth represent the generating influence of both, brought into action by the rays of the Sun. They are the two inferior and passive Elements, as the Sun and Air above them are the superior and active Elements of Fire and Air. Furthermore, these two children resemble t he sign Gemini which unites the Earthy Sign of Taurus with the Watery Sign Cancer, and thi s sign was, by the Greeks and Romans, referred to Apollo and the Sun. The magical title is Lord of the Fire of the World. 18th KEY-THE MOON Before you upon the Altar is the 18th Key of Tarot which symbolically resumes ideas. It represents the Moon with four Hebrew Yods like d rops of dew falling, two Dogs, two Towers, a winding Path leading to the Horizon, and in the foreground, Water with a Crayfish crawling through it to the land. The Moon is in its increase on the side of Mercy, Gedulah, and from it proceed sixteen principle and sixteen secon dary rays, which make 32, the number of the Paths of Yetzirah. She is the Moon at the feet of t he Woman of Revelations, ruling equally over the cold and moist natures and the passive ele ments of Earth and Water. It is to be noted that the symbol of the Sign is formed of two lunar crescents bound together. It thus shows the lunar nature of the Sign. The Dogs are the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 15 Jackals of the Egyptian Anubis, guarding the Gates of the East and of the West, shown by the two Towers between which lies th e Path of all the heavenly bodies ever rising in the East and setting in the West.

Also, when the Sun is in the Sign Pisces the Moon will be well in her increase in Can cer as shown b y the Cra y-fish emblem. The Moon has the magical title of Ruler of Flux and Reflux, Child of the Sons of the Might y. 17th KEY-THE S TAR Before you on the Altar is the 17th Key of the Taro t which symbolically resumes these ideas. The large Star in the center of the Heavens has sev en principal and fourteen secondary rays and this represents the Heptad multi plied by the Triad. This yields 21 - the Number of the Divine Name Eheieh which, as you alread y know, is attached to Kether. In the Egyptian sense, it is Sirius, the Dog-Star, the Star of Isis-Sothis. Around it are the S tars of the S even P lanets each with its seven-fold counter-changed operation. The nude female figure with the Star of the Heptagr am on her brow is the synthesis of Isis, of Nephth ys, and of Hathor. S he also represents the planet Venus through whose sphere the influence of Chesed descen ds. She is Aima, Binah, Tebunah, the Great Supernal Mother-Aima Elohim, pouring upon the Earth the W aters of Creation which unite and form a River at her feet, the River going forth from the Supernal Eden which floweth and faileth not. Note well, that in this Key she is completely unvei led while in the 21st Key she is only partially s o. The two Urns contain the influences from Chokmah an d Binah. On the right springs the Tree of Life, and on the left the Tree of Knowledge of Good and of Evil whereon the Bird of Hermes alights, and therefore d oes this Ke y represent the restored W orld, after the formless and the Void and the Darkness, the New Adam the countenance of the Man which falls in the sign Aqua rius. And therefore doth the astronomical ripple of this sign represent, as it w ere, Waves of Water - the ripples of that River going forth out of Eden - but, therefore also, is it justly attributed to Air and not unto Water because it is the Firmament dividing and containing the W aters. The magical motto of this Ke y is Daughter of the Fi rmament, Dweller between the W aters. 16th KEY-BLAS TED TOW ER Before you on the Altar is the 16th Key of Tarot, w hich symbolically resumes these ideas. It represents a Tower struck by a Ligh tening Flash proceeding from a rayed circle and terminating in a triangle. It is t he Tower of Babel struck by the Fire from Heaven. It is to be"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 16 noted that the triangle at the end of the flash, is suing from the circle, forms exactly the astronomical symbol of Mars. It is the P ower of the Triad rushing down and destr o ying the Columns of Darkness. Three holes are rent in the walls, symbol ising the establishment of the Triad therein and the Crown at the summit of the Tower is falling, as the Crowns of the Kings of Edom fell, who are also symbolised by the men falli ng headlong. On the right hand side of the Tower is Ligh t and the representation of the Tree of Life b y ten circles thus disposed. On the left hand side is Darkness and eleven circle s symbolising the Qlippoth. Lord of the Hosts of the Might y is its magical name . 15th KEY-DEVIL The 15th Key of the Tarot represents a goat-headed satyr-like Demon whose legs are hairy - his feet and claws standing upon a Cubi cal Altar. He has heavy bat-like wings. In his left hand, which points downwards, he holds a lighted torch, and in his right, which is elevated, a horn of water. The left hand p oints downwards to show that it is the infernal and burning, not the celestial and life-gi ving flame which is kindled in his torch - just as when the Sun is in Capricornus, to which co ld and earthy Sign this Key corresponds, solar Light is at its weakest and the natures of cold and moisture triumph over heat and dryness. The cubical Altar presents t he Universe - right and left of it, bound thereto by a cord attached to a circle which typifi es the center of the Earth, are two smaller demons, one male and one female. The y hold a cord in their hands. The whole figure shows the gross generative powers of nature on the material plane, and is analogous to the Pan of the Greeks and the Egyptian God of Mendes (the symbol of Khem). In certain aspects, the Key represents the b rutal forces of nature, which to the unbelieving man only obscures and does not reflect the luminous Countenance of God. It also alludes to the sexual powers of natural genera tion. Thus therefore the Key fitly balances the symbol of Death on the other side of t he Tree of Life. On the smaller demons, one points downwards and one upwards, answe ring to the positions of the hands of the central figures. Beneath his feet are P entagrams on which he trample s (whence comes their title of Wizard's foot) and his head is covered with the evil and reversed Pentagram. and his hands bear the torch and horn - the symbols of Fire and Water, so does his form unite the Earth in his hairy and bestial aspect, and the Air in his bat-like wings. Thus he represents the gross and materialized Elemental Forces of Natu re; and the whole would be an evil symbol, were it not for the Pentagram of Light abov e his head which regulates and guides his movements. He is the eternal renewer of all the changing forms of Creation in conformity with the Law of The All-P owerful One (Bl essed be He) which controlling Law is t ypified by the controlling P entagram of Lig ht surmounting the whole. This Ke y is an emblem of tremendous force; man y and univ ersal are its m ysteries. The magical title of this Key is Lord of the Gates of Matter, Child of the Forces of Time."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 17 14th KEY-TEMP ERANCE This drawing represents the more ancient form of th e 14th Key of Tarot, for which the later and more usual form of Temperance was soon su bstituted, as better representing the natural symbolism of the Path Sagittarius. The earl ier figure was considered not so much a representation of this P ath alone, as the s ynthesis of that and the others conjoined. The later figure, therefore, is better adapted to the more re stricted meaning. The more ancient forms shows a female figure crowned with the crown of fiv e ra ys, s ymbolising the Five Principles of Nature, the concealed Spirit and the Four Elemen ts of Earth, Air, Water and Fire. About her head is a halo of light. On her breast is the S un o f Tiphareth. The Five-rayed Crown further alludes to the Five Sephiroth Kether, Chokmah, Bina h, Chesed and Geburah. Chained to her waist are a Lion and an Eagle, between which is a l arge cauldron whence arise steam and smoke. The Lion represents the Fire in Netz ach - th e Blood of the Lion, and the Eagle represents the W ater in Hod, the Gluten of the Eagl e whose reconcilement is made by the Air in Yesod, uniting with the volatilised Water arisin g from the cauldron through the influence of the Fire beneath it. The chains which link the Lion and the Eagle to her waist, are symbolic of the Paths of Scorpio and Capricornus as shown by th e S corpion and the Goat in the background. In her right hand, she bears the Torch of Solar Fire elevating and volatilising the Water in Hod by the fiery influence of Geburah, whi le with her left hand, she pours from a vase the Waters of Chesed to temper and calm the Fi res of Netz ach. This latter form is the usual figure of Temperance, symbolising in a more r estricted form than the preceding, the peculiar properties of this Path. It represents an Angel with the Solar emblem of Tiphareth on her brow, and wings of the aerial and volatilising nature, pouring together the fluidic fire and the fiery water thus combining, harmonising and tem pering those opposing elements. One foot rests on dry and volcanic land, in the bac kground of which is a volcano whence issues an eruption. The other foot is in the water by whose border springs fresh vegetation, contrasting strongly with the arid and dry nature o f the distant land. On her breast is a square, the emblem of rectitude. The whole figure is a repr esentation of that straight and narrow way of which it is said, \"few there be that find it\" wh ich alone leads to the higher and glorified life. For to pursue that steady and tranquil mean between two opposing forces, is indeed difficult, and many are the temptations to turn aside either t o the right or to the left - wherein, remember, are but to be found the menacing symbols of Death a nd the Devil. The magical title is Daughter of the Reconcilers, t he Bringer Forth of Life. 13th KEY-DEATH The 13th Key of Tarot represents a figure of a Skel eton, upon which some portions of flesh still remain. In a field he is reaping off wi th Scythe of Death the fresh vegetation which springs from the corrupting bodies buried therein - fragments of which, such as hands, heads and feet appear above the soil. One of the heads we ars a kingly crown; another is apparentl y that of a person of little note, showing that Death is the equaliser of all"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 18 conditions. The five extremities, the head, hands a nd feet, allude to the powers of the number five, the Letter He, the Penta gram - the concealed Spirit of Life and the Four Elements - the originator of all living form. The Sign of Scorpio especially alludes to stagnant and foetid water - t hat property of the moist nature which initiates putrefaction and decay. The eternal change from life into death through death into life, is symbolised by the grass which s prings from and is nourished by putrifying and corrupting carcasses; the herbiage, in its turn affords food to animals and man, which again when dead, nourisheth vegetabl e life and bring to growth and perfection the living herbiage. This is further sho wn by the figure itself putrifying and decaying as it reaps the grass of the field. \"As fo r man, his days are as grass, as a flower of the field, so he f ou r i s h e t h . \"T h e top of the scyt he forms the Tau Cross of Life, showing that what destroys also renews. The whole is a representation of the eternal transm utation of the life of nature, which reforms all things into fresh images and simi litudes. This symbol represents the corrosive and destructive action of the infernal Fi re as opposed to the Celestial - the Dragon of the Waters, the Typhon of the Egyptians, the Slayer of Osiris - which later yet rises again in Horus. The Scorpion, Serpent of Evil, delineated before the figure of Death in the more ancient form of the Key refers to the mixed and transforming, therefore deceptive, nature of this emblem. Behind him, is the symbol of the Nameless One, representing the Seed and its germ, not yet di fferentiated into Life, therefore incapable of definition. The Scorpion is the emblem of ruthless destruction; the Snake is the mixed and deceptive nature, serving alike fo r good and evil; the Eagle is the higher and Divine Nature, yet to be found herein, t he Alchemical Eagle of distillation, the Renewer of Life. As it is said, \"Thy youth shal l be renewed like the Eagles.\" Great indeed, and many are the mysteries of this terrible Kev. The magical title is The Child of the Great Transfo rmers, Lord of the Gates of Death. 12th KEY-HANGED MAN The Spirit of the Mighty Waters The gallows from which this figure is suspended for ms a Tau cross. The figure itself, from the position of the legs, forms a fylf ot cross. It also represents the alchemical symbol of Sulphur in reverse. There is a halo about the head of the seeming marty r. It should be noted that (1) the tree of sacrifice is living wood as indicated b y leaves growing thereon; (2) that the face expresses deep entrancement, not suffering; (3 ) that the figure, as a whole, suggests life in suspension, but life and not death . It is a card of profound significance but all the significance is veiled. His arms, clasp ed behind him, form an upright Triangle, and this radiates Light. His mouth is res olutely closed. Waite dismisses most interpretations saying very simply that for him it expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and the Universe. He wh o can understand that the story of his higher nature is embedded in this symbolism will receive intimations concerning a great awakening that is possible, and will know that after the sacred Myster y of Death there is a glorious Mystery of Res urrection."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 19 It is attributed to the letter Mem, the element of Water, joining Geburah to Hod; Mars to Mercur y. You will remember that the letter Mem occupies the middle position in the series of the Three Mothers. It is said in the Zoha r that its open operation is through the descent of its influence to the abyss, and thus it restrains the rising of those great waters by which the earth would otherwise again be inundated. In its close operation, it restricts the power of judgement from the downward course thereof. It is also said that it is like a vessel which in turn is sealed and unsealed, according as there is inhibition or indulgence of its influx to the em anations which are below. With the more general import of the Hanged Man you will be already familiar; but in this Grade you are invited to regard it afte r a new manner, which can still be brought into harmony with the previous forms of int erpretation, since it is simply an advance thereon. The enforced sacrifice and punishm ent, the involuntary and fatal loss, which are ascribed to it in our Tarot teachin g, are here connected with the Divine death, with the sacrifice of God himself. Th at death connects closely with the true meaning attached to the High Ceremony of t he Corpus Christi wherein the Chief Adept typifies at once the Founder of the Ros icrucian Order and the Founder of the Universe. Year b y ye ar, the Order is withdrawn for one moment of time that it ma y be again formulated out of chaos; the Builder is also withdrawn into the concealment of the Tomb, as you are told in the symbolism of the 5 equals 6 grade. The Founder of our Rosicrucian Fraternity was taken hence that Lig ht should come to His disciples, and the Maker of the great world entered into anoth er concealment, for God dies in order that man shall live, and shall not only seek but find Him. The symbolism with which we are here dealing also r ecalls the Apocalyptic figures of the Lamb slain from the foundation of th e world, and in correspondence with previous explanations, it indicates that the p almary misfortune of the universe, which is exoterically called the Fall of Man, ex erc ised a species of incomprehensible compulsion upon the Divine Nature, so that the scheme of what is familiar to everyon e under the name of redemptio n comes before us in a certain manner as an eternal necessit y and as a consequence of the free will rather of man than God. The importance which has been attached throughout t he Grades of our Two Orders to Egyptian symbolism should also remind us that Mem, through the sacrifice of Christ, has analogy with the legend of the dead Osiris, one of whose appellations was the shipwrecked or drowned Mariner, even as thi s terrible Ke y, which you see now in its true form, represents a drowned giant. The 23rd Path of the Tree is referred to the Elemen tal sign of Water, and in this diagram the drowned giant is depicted reposing on t he rocky bed of the ocean with the rainbow at his feet, corresponding to that other ra inbow seen in the apocalyptic vision around the Throne of the Slain Lamb. A s ymbol famil iar to the brethren of the S econd Order is here interpreted with reference to its most ex alted sense. The drowned giant is that which has been sunk below the phenomenal world b y a"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 20 sacrifice eternall y preordained, which, in one of i ts aspects at least, is the necessar y limitation suffered by the Divine Nature in the act of becoming manifest. The Divine, in a word, is drowned in the waters of natural life and that which in this respect obtains in the external world, obtains also for humanity, wherein the Divine Spark, beyond all plummets of the sense, all reach of the logical understanding is immersed in the waters of the material existence. I n both cases, the symbol with which we are dealing corresponds to the legend of our Fou nder, sleeping in the centre of the Tomb which is encircled by the Rainbow, as in the S anctuary of Israel there was the abiding P resence of the Shekinah. 11th KEY-JUS TICE That to which your attention is especially drawn is the Key of Justice, referrable to the letter Lamed, whereto many attrib utions are given. The writers of the Zohar and the old scholiasts thereon dwell upon the form of Lamed which is the highest of all the letters; they say also that it i s composite, being formulated of Vau and Kaph. These are the accidents of their subtlet y , but you should know that its dominion is in the hour of the planet Shabbathai or Saturn, because from Binah, which is the great Sabbath, the rest whereof we des ire, there is an influx to the P ath of Lamed through the P ath of Geburah, from the S eph irah Binah. It further denotes the M yster y of Equilibrium. Now, the place of Geburah can be withstood only b y those who restrain their c oncupiscence, because it is the S upernal Tribunal, and Geburah in this sense, signi fied the force of will, as Lamed is the condition of equilibrium, which represents the Portal of the M ysteries. The ideas which have been thus expressed are found differently exhibited by another order of symbolism in the two Pillars which stand at the Western Angles of the Altar, (in the 6 equals 5 ritual) bearing respectiv el y a lighted candle and a human skull. W ith the conventional attributions of light in the numerical order and the obvious lessons to be derived from the disjecta mem bra of humanity, we have no concern here. They speak too fully for themselves. Of that death-watch which encompasses us in the mid st of ordinary life there is however little realization. All that falls short of the mystic end falls short of the life of life, outside of which we are still in the sphere o f simulacra.. . It is possible, however, that another light may be added to his natural condition, by which the desire of the true end which is set be fore all beings, and of the life which is beyond all life of the apparent order. It is then t hat he is made ready to set out on the great search, when the higher light which has now e ntered within him goes also before him, and the desire of the Holy House is enkindled in his heart. In this manner he passes under the judgments and the severities of hi s election, behind which is the concealed love that shall take him to his term. For as the natural man is impelled by a certain elementary justice suited to his"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 21 condition, so there is a justice which is above, wo rking in the souls of the chosen ones, so that once indeed, they shall taste death, that they may pass into life forever, under the auspices of the Faithful Intelli gence. Justice is the Daughter of the Lord of Truth, The H older of the Balances. 10th KEY-WHEEL OF FORTUNE The Lord of the Forces of Life The form of the Order's Ke y of The Wheel of Fortune is much more simple than most renditions. There are shown only three fi gures - the winged Sphynx above, the revolving wheel in the center, while below is a sit ting, pensive monkey, a cynocephalus. The Sphynx is half beast and half human, female as indicated by breasts, while the head is covered by a nemyss encircled by a halo . Thus it represents humanity as a whole, evolving from its primordial animal state to human self-consciousness. But that is not all. The presence of large wings, indic ate the divinity of the figure, so that the symbol as a whole suggests the Real Self of man hidden behind the veil of the lower Sephiroth, the lower self or personality. The higher Triad is well represented by being above the other two symbolic figures. The wheel is the symbol of time, cyclic progression and thus of karma. The wheel of the zodiac and astrology per se are repres entative of the cosmic clock constantly ticking away to bring into fresh activit y the latent seeds of ancient deeds whereby we rise or fall as our fortunes, in the bro adest sense of the term, fluctuate with the passage of time. The cynocephalus is below, often described as Herma nubis, the combination of Hermes the messenger of the Gods, and lower mind, a nd Anubis, the dog-faced (or jackal) God who presided over death and mummificati on, and the watcher over the tombs of the dead. Watching over the tomb is requir ed to permit resurrection - and thus he is associated with immortality, rising thro ugh the wheel of life from transitoriness to the overshadowing sphynx above, e ternity. It is symbolized by the letter Caph, referred to Ju piter on The Tree. Caph is not a closed hand, nor an open hand, but a curved hand, as if to hold or contain something. 9th KEY-THE HERMIT The Hermit on most packs of the Tarot is practicall y the same. It is a hooded and cloaked figure, an old man, bearing a staff in one hand, and a lamp or lantern in the other. Like Diogenes of old, he may be looking for Truth - the truth about man and his relationship with the universe. He is a sol itary figure; there is none other with him. In the search to reach the divine, one is alon e in quest of the Alone. At the same time he represents the Kerux in the initiatory ritu als, the shower of the way - the Kerux who points out the way to the hidden knowledg e. The Hermit is attributed to the letter Yod on the T ree and to the sign Virgo, ruled by Mercur y. Mercury is not yet knowledge, but is the means whereby knowledge is"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 22 transmitted, the symbol of the nervous system, with all its circuits - from the most primitive to those that are in the process of development. Insofar as Virgo is the sign to which the Hermit is attributed, it has a connection with human sexuality in its yet virginal or prepubescent state. It represents man on the edge or precipice of Becoming , of the adolescent emerging from latent potentiality, of the adept who has not yet arrived at the full stage of all his possibilities, but who is nevertheless enroute. His magical title is The Magus of the Voice of Ligh t, The Prophet of the Gods. 8th KEY-S TRENGTH There are many versions of this Key, all variations of the Woman with the Lion. Some cards show her closing the mouth of the Lion, others opening the mouth of the Lion. The Order card shows her side by side with the Lion, both in an amicable relationship. She represents Nature in all her Vastness, the Gene trix from which the vast universes are made and from which they are construc ted. The Lion in the Order is the sign of Leo, not merely the fifth sign in the n atural zodiac, referred to the 5th house - sex and love, but not yet marriage - but it is the First Sign of the reconstructed or Initiated Zodiac from which all the decanates an d quinaries begin. It therefore symbolizes esoterically the Beginning or C reation o f things, and to that extent has man y subtle meanings. It is referred to the letter Teth on the Tree, mean ing a serpent, having in Genesis a sexual connotation. The Serpent is also the sperm atozoon, the stimulator of new life in the female. As such it also represents Kundalini , the spinal spirit-fire without which there can be no transmutation, no spiritual g rowth or development, no new birth. Kundalini is the human aspect of the great G oddess Shakti, the cosmic energy or Fohat, depending on the system you employ, whose seven sons carve seven holes in space wherein develop the seven planets - or chakra s in the merel y human sense. The card itself therefore is replete with many sign ifications and requires deep meditation to discern its concealed m ysteries. Here the magical title is Daughter of the Flaming S word, Leader of the Lion. 7th KEY-THE CHARIOT In the Order system, the chariot is not grounded or fixed as in most other renditions. It is soaring through space drawn b y tw o horses, the positive and negative forces of nature, given direction by the h ead of a Sphynx, again symbolizing the Higher. The charioteer is the King, the Yod of Tetragrammation, the Father of all. In all renditions, however, the symbolic meaning co nveyed is the union of two opposites, which together can draw the vehicle of t he Higher Man towards the Great Goals he is attempting to reach. It is remini scent of the Oath of the Adeptus Minor in which he promises to become, with the divi ne aid, more than human by uniting himself with his higher and divine Genius."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 23 As such it is the s ymbol of the Great Work, represe nted b y the letter Cheth, meaning a Fence, and whose Gematria is 418. These n umbers add to 13, which are also the numbers of Ahavoh, Love, and Echod, One or Unit y. Both together equal 26, the Gematria of Tetragrammation. The magical title of this Key is Child of the Power of the Waters, Lord of the Triumph of Light. 6th KEY-THE LOVERS Of all the historical designs, this Golden Dawn Tar ot card is certainly the most different. Most others show a man and woman standin g before a vast Angelic figure. In this particular key, we have a woman cha ined to a rock before which is a monster or threatening dragon. Above, we perceive t he descent of Perseus with radiant shield, winged helmet, and a sword in his right han d about to rescue the helpless maiden. One of the man y possible interpretations is the lib erating effect of the descent of the higher Genius, the freeing effect of illumination. To quote Robert Wang in his book The Golden Dawn Tarot, \"Here P erseus is shown freeing Andromeda from the solid rock of materialism, and f rom the Dragon of Fear. The `Love' here is one of the divine Union, a mystery n ot even hinted at by the usual image of a man and woman whose earthly union is bei ng blessed b y a central Angelic figure.\" The Hebrew letter to which this Ke y is attributed i s Za yin, meaning a sword - in this instance not merely the sword of division and discrimination, but the sword of conquest and liberation. Its number is 7, which also refers indirectly to Netzach Victory, and to the planet Venus whose meaning is L ove and Union and Fertilit y. The magical title of this Key is Children of the Vo ice Divine, the Oracles of the Mighty Gods. 5th KEY-THE HIEROP HANT Again, the Golden Dawn card is radically different from those in other packs. It shows a seated figure, bearded and crowned with a t riple tiara, seated on a throne whose two arms end with bulls' heads. Quite simply, the card is attributed to the letter Vav, also attributed to Taurus, the z odiacal Bull. In the Order teaching, the Hierophant is the Expoun der of the Mysteries and his throne is in the East of the Temple. He is repr esentative of Osiris, the resurrection god of Egypt, and as such never moves from the dais. If he does move, he represents Aroueris, one of the forms of Horus the Elder, and in moving he administers the obligation to the candidate and sub sequentl y officiates and confirms the fact of initiation. Initiation in the Order really takes place between the two pillars when the Higher Genius is, as it were, poised to make contact with the asp iring ego of the Candidate. He also is bearer of the Banner of the East, which indicates the rising of the Light, the central fact of initiation. S ome of the older packs describe him as the P ope, the highest"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 24 authority of the Catholic Church. But Pope means in reality Father and as the Initiator, the Hierophant certainly represents an a uthoritative father figure - the one whose power and function is to stir up and initiate the creative process in the Genetrix or Mother. His magical title is Magus of the Eternal Gods. 4th KEY-THE EMPEROR The symbolism of this card is forthright, in that i t depicts the Emperor sitting on a throne with an actual ram (for Aries) under his f eet, and carrying a wand with the head of a ram. Since Aries is ruled by Mars, this c ard represents enormous creative energy and of course rulership. One set of Order sy mbols or attributions depicts the Mars decanate of Pisces as the end of one c ycle of the year, and another Mars decanate in Aries to represent the tremendous power involved in the return of Spring when Nature begins to evidence growth an d the emerg ence of Life once more in S pring. One of the apparent paradoxes of the Order symbolis m, is that this card is attributed not merely to Mars, a very masculine sym bol but to the letter Heh which is distinctly feminine. It is the first Heh of Tetragr ammaton, signifying the Mother. All symbols contain their own opposites, thus creating a balance of opposing forces, without which the universe would come to an end. The Emperor is patently the consort of the Empress, the preceding card attributed to Venus and Daleth, indicating that the two had better be considered together. One is masculine and the other is feminin e. One is force and fire; the other is beauty, luxury and fecundity. It is worth rememb ering that a poet once wrote that man is peace and the woman is power. This magical title is S on of the Morning, Chief amo ng the Might y. 3rd KEY-THE EMP RESS The Empress here is not unlike most of the figures in other and older packs. S he is attributed to the letter Daleth, meaning a G ate, and is the uppermost of the so-called Reciprocal Paths on the Tree, joining Cho kmah to Binah, the celestial Father and Mother. Venus is attributed to that wall of the Vault of the Adepts which is the entry to the Vault and the P astos, which is thu s the symbol rebirth. She is a stately figure, seated on a throne, having rich vestments and royal aspect, as - says Waite - of a daughter of heaven and earth . There is a dove to the right of her, descending as it were from above. She bears a scept re, that of royalty, surmounted by a globe, while in the other hand is the Ankh, the sym bol both of Venus and of eternal Life. In Waite's lovely language, in which he fears to use an English phrase when a Latin one will do better, she is not the Queen of H eaven, but nonetheless she is still the Refuge of all Sinners, the fruitful Mother of t housands. There are also certain aspects of this card which correctl y describe her a s desire and the wings thereof, as the woman clothed with the Sun, as Gloria Mundi and the veil of the Hol y of Holies."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 25 She is above all things universal fecundity and des ire, but there is no direct message which has been given to man like that which is borne of woman. In another order of ideas, the card of the Empress signifies the door or gate by which an entrance is obtained into this life, as in to the Garden of Venus, or as in the Vault of the Adepti. Then the way which leads out t herefrom, to the secret known to the High Priestess; is communicated onl y to the ele ct. Her magical title is Daughter of the Might y Ones. 2nd KEY-THE HIGH P RIES TES S The Golden Dawn card is almost simplistic without a n y of the mur complex and elucidatory symbols of the other packs. She is clearly a lunar symbol, representing the Path of Gimel leading from Kether to Tiphareth, passing through the Abyss without at y break in continuit y. Instead of having the crescent moon at her feet as in most of the current packs, she wears the crescent on her forehead, above her e yes, and holds a Cup (rather like the Order Water cup) in her hands over her chest. I n this aspect, she seems more like the Stolistes, the cup-bearer in the Golden Da wn ceremonies. Nor is she placed between the two Pillars of Jachin and Boaz, of Seve rity and Mildness, as in many other of the more commonly used decks; she does not thus represent the Hegemon, the guide or leader of the Aspirant. Her clothing or vestments are flowing and gauzy, bl ue in color, and the whole is bathed in an aura of light, a shimmering radiance. To quote Waite once more, she is the spiritual Bride and Mother, the daughter of the Stars and the higher Garden of Eden. The symbol of the Shekinah, the abiding prese nce of the Most High, the co- habiting glor y. S he is the Queen of the Borrowed Li ght, since the moon reflects the light of the Sun, but this is the light of all. The Priestess of the Silver Star is her honorary ti tle, and thus is the means whereby entry is gained into the invisible Third or Highest Order within the Order. 1st KEY-THE MAGICIAN This is a young man, with the Caduceus on his chest vestments, facing the altar on which are the four elemental weapons so frequent l y spoken of in the Golden Dawn. They are depicted here ex actly as the y are in the document describing the making of the four elemental weapons which have alm ost a universal application. They not only represent the four suits of the Tarot , the four Worlds of the Kabalah, the four Beasts of the Apocalypse -the four Kerubic signs - they represent the four letters of the Tetragammaton and so are the vice-re gents of the Holy Name. Again, the Order has made a radical departure from most packs. This magician does not have one hand raised towards heaven, and t he other pointing downwards. They are poised as if to grasp one of the magical w eapons wherewith he accomplishes his rites."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 26 His hat has a wide brim resembling the figure eight in a lateral position, the symbol of infinity, the sign of the Holy Spirit. It is like an endless cord, almost like a serpent appearing to devour its own tail, reminding one of the last line of the Bornless Invocation - \" I am He, the Grace of the World; the H eart girt with a Serpent is my Name.\" Insofar as he is attributed to the Letter Beth and to Mercury, and since he has the symbol of the Staff of Mercury on his chest, he is the higher Mercury, Thoth the God of Wisdom and of Utterance, the God who cometh forth from the Veil. His magical title is The Magus of Power. 0-THE FOOL In this card the most complete departure from the c onventional packs is depicted. Instead of showing a man in motley, strid ing along, heedless of the dog which is yapping at his heels, we have revealed a n aked child standing beneath a rose- tree bearing yellow roses. They represent the golde n Rose of Joy as well as the Rose of Silence. While reaching up to the Roses, he yet holds in leash a grey wolf, wordly_ wisdom held in check by perfect innocence a nd the divine nature. Waite describes him as a prince of the other world on his travels through this one - all amidst the morning glory, in the keen air . He is the Spirit in search of experience. Probably the finest description of the Fool is to b e found in that profound work, The Book of Thoth by Aleister Crowley. Though his designs for the Foo l as painted by Frieda Harris differ enormously from the Order version. nonetheless the reader would do well to study what Crowley has to s ay in this connection. This alone should shatter any convictions one may have about C rowley's supposed perplexities. There is more wisdom in this one description and in terpretation than in many a tome on all the Tarot trumps contributed by anyone else. I go further than this, and suggest that the student study the Golden Dawn Tarot deck i n conjunction with his book, and even with his own version of the Tarot cards themse lves. The magical title is the Spirit of Ether."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 27 NOTES ON GEOMANCY No authorship has been ascertained for this paper. Quite patently it is neither b y S. R. M. D., nor by N.O.M. It is not listed as a mongst the Flying Rolls. I gather it to have been contributed by one of the rank and fil e of the Order members who had found some interest in Geomanc y. S tudents are often inclined to set aside Geomanc y a s a thing of little use and small account, a fantastic and empiric mode of divi nation, merely a species of ultra elaborate tossing up, pure chance in fact, laboriou sly interpreted. The reason seems to be that in all the books and manuscripts dealing with Geomancy no elementar y explanation of it is ever vouchsafed. This the stud ent is assumed to know, and is given straight away rule a for the erection of figu res and elaborate lists of the names and sigils of Genii and Rulers until he naturall y f inds himself bored or wearied. It is to supply this lack that this paper is writte n in the hope that some students may find therein what they have been lacking. First then as to the word itself. All words ending in the termination \"mancy\" refer to some for m of prophecying, from Mantis, a prophet. By this I mean not necessarily in fortune telling, though this too may be included, but rather the setting forth of the thing s that are behind the Veil of matter. All inspired utterances, in a sense all great poems , are prophecying. The priest is the commissioned executant, and as such is subordinate to the prophet. Now the prophet takes some material manifestation, and at this poin t lifts a corner of the veil, disclosing, under the appearance of some material t oken, the essential Divine Truth laying behind. Thus cheiromancy is prophecying from the hand. Necromancy (which is black magic) is prophecying from the corpse (a m ethod in"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 28 favor with the Roman Augurs who used the bodies of sacrificial victims). Geomancy, from Gaia the Earth, is prophecying from the Earth itself. We have then to consider how the veil that hides while it manifests the mystery of creation is lifted to the gaze of the inspired Seer. For this is the Veil of Isis, the penetration of which was the goal and object of the Egyptian S eers. As above, so below, was the arcanum of the Emerald Tablet of Hermes. We are taught that the eternal ideas of God are reveal ed as in a picture book b y the starr y sphere to the eyes of those who can see, and the starry sphere is reflected in the Earth, so that every spot is the reflection of some constellation or star group, and over these wander the planets in their order. Four great Archangels keep watch and ward over the four quarters. From this knowledge we ma y see the reasons for the characteristics of countries, towns and places pers isting quite independently of the race that inhabit them. We can see why it is that e ver in Rome is the imperial spirit of domination and material power, whether it was inhab ited as at first by the outcasts and broken men from every race, the great \"Asylum\" as it was called, or afterwards a homogeneous Republic, then an Empire with world dom inion, then a hierarchy with well nigh a universal spiritual dominion, but alway s the same spirit. Or why again, the various races that have come to China have one and all become ultra Chinese. In every case the spirit of the place sometimes is strong en ough to dominate all who come in. Or in other cases to produce its own effect. Thus w e may perhaps say that all the forces behind the veil shine through and can be per ceived. If the prophet can catch and translate these he can give information of high value to his brethren. Obviously to do this he must entirel y sink and obliterate his own personalit y, for his intellect can onl y perceive and reason about this side of the veil. While his attention is fixed on this he is necessarily blind to the indications of what lies behind. Let us for a moment look at some other terminations . \"Nomy\" signifies laws - as astronomy is the law of this starry universe. That is to say (for we can really know nothing of the laws governing this great unive rse) the methodical s ynthesis of observation. \"Ology\" is the \"word\" - the divine messenger drawn from the manifestation - thus Astrology is the message drawn from the stars, the discourse concerning them, as shown by the science of astronom y. But a s to the Ea rth, we have Geology, which signifies the discourse concerning the earth though as yet this discourse concerns merely the age of the earth, and the kind of creatu res that inhabited it thousands of centuries ago, and the changes that have passed ove r its surface. There is also Geometry or the measurement of earth which is a mor e subtle science, for it concerns itself with abstract numbers and figures. Now at the outset of Geomancy, as set forth in book s and manuscripts, we are confronted with the lists of the names of the Ruler s, Genii, Angels, and Intelligences, which have no apparent reason, and with seemingly a rbitrary figures called Sigils. The learning of these to some is a weariness and it see ms profitless. But let the student then look on them as the names of personalities with who m he will become acquainted. You know, for example, that your friend's name is J ohn or David; your enemy's name may be Hans or Karl. The"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 29 mention of these names at once brings to your mind the idea of that personality. We could not discuss these friendly or hostile ideas without using these names. We do not know why our friend was christened John, but we accept the fact, and just so we regard the Sigils, as we do the lett ers of the Alphabet. We do not know why the letter `J' has the particular power that it has, but if we wish to communicate to another in writing the idea denoted by `John' we em ploy it, and the children must learn the alphabet before they can begin to read. Now as to the mechanical method employed by the Geo mantic diviner. As we have seen he must entirely subordinate his own pers onality, his reason, his intellect, his human will. He must become completely passive. We h ave all heard of the process of automatic writing where the seer as medium allows h is hand to be used by some superhuman or subhuman intelligence, that messages may be written through him without his will, often without his consciousness. But herein it is extremely difficult to entirely withdraw the will so that the message i s not coloured, even transmuted, or at least modified, b y his own brain. The Geomant ic method of making a series of dots or strokes on paper without counting, ensures so far as it is possible that the intellect has no part therein. What is it then that determines whether the number be odd or even? The answer is clear; it is rhythm. Con sider then any four-lined verse, with alternate feminine and masculine endings. The rhythm of this will give a geomantic figure of two dots, one dot, two dots, on e dot. When the brain is entirely quiescent, the message f rom behind the veil of physical matter may be perceived in the form of rhy thm, not consciously indeed, but affecting the nerves and pulses, affecting the hand . A tune we may say, dances through the body, the rhythm of it manifests in the strokes unconsciously made. Whence then comes this tune? The starry sky is the reflex of God's thought of Himself, the earth in the reflex of the firmament, the aura of man is the reflex of the earth. The rhythm of the tune then manifests the id ea behind the veil. The geomantic figure sets down in geometric form the rhythm of th e tune and consequentl y the idea. Let us now consider what we mean by an idea. Old Jo hn Heydon, the most profound writer in Geomanc y, defines the idea as an invisible created spirit. This ma y be more comprehensible if we imagine any manife st object - a man, a flower, a tree, or what you will. Take the sum of all the att ributes you know of that object, and then make up the ideal"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 30 presentment in the idea thereof. It is invisible, b ut it is there. So we may say a sculptor has the idea of his statue before he has m ade the roughest sketch. And a genius he defines as a certain divine spirit that w orketh secret things in nature miraculously. So that, he says, there is no great d ifference between a Genius and a Divine idea. Now as you stand in a definite spot on the earth's surface and ask a question, the answer is there, involved in your question, if you can but get at it. The question and answer are both in the divine idea, and the idea is manifested by the rhythmic movement, the tune, that your spirit catches from b ehind the veil. Take then for example a stanza with alternate femin ine and masculine endings. Broadly the effect is exhilarating. It goe s to a dance rhythm, it is full of hope and joy, it tells of the gaining of something desir ed, and the geomantic figure we have formed is thus: and we learn to call it \"Acquisitio. \" We are further taught to make a talismanic figure by joining the dots we have set down thus: This seems at first sight a purely empiric and prac tically useless thing. But let us look at it in another way. We wish to receive the i nformation we desire, and the natural method is to hold out some receptacle. Our appropriate symbol is a cup to receive the wine of divine grace, and a cup is the natural symbol of \"Acquisitio.\" The spiritual gift is behind the veil, the material ref lex of it is the gift of what we desire on Earth. Two cups therefore appropriately s ymboliz e the answer to our question."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 31 Now as in Egypt the picture writing gradually conve ntionalized into hieroglyphics, so the representation of the two cup s may become the hieroglyphic symbol, the dots and angles of Acquisitio. These indicate the rhythm that has come from behind the veil, bearing the answer to our query. We have now to consider that e very point on the surface of Earth has its own occult forces, which are here man ifested. To a certain extent this will be generally admitted. We know that there are sacred places, often in the old days marked with stone circles, and that the influe nce of them is so strong that in spite of themselves, succeeding races and different peopl es will involuntarily build their sacred shrines in the same spots. Many believe that ill-luck invariably follows the p rofaning of such sites. It is commonly said that about certain places there is a special influence for good or evil, which an y sensitive person who comes there ca n feel. If this is true of certain places it would seem to follow that ever y place has its special influence and occult forces, which can be there manifested. But the forc es that manifest in an y place are not fix ed and invariable. Imagine then that you stand on a point of the earth 's surface and your mind is troubled with some question and intuition comes to you to seek the solution behind the veil. You are feeling in your mind the Divine i nfluence ruling that particular spot, and unconsciously it may be so. You know that it holds within it the answer could you but get at it. Perhaps you consider no or dinary method of divination, but there comes to you a feeling of hope and joy, of ex hilaration, a certain sense that all will be well. Your inner being has caught the rh ythm that promise s success. Here then Geomanc y enables yo u to set down the rh ythm in blac k and white, and to interpret in detail. But it does more than this. To the vague sense that has permeated your inner being there is much risk of delusion. It is impossi ble to exclude the material personality, the outer side of the veil. Modes of e xhilaration or depression may come from ph ysical causes. Geomancy, as we have seen, excludes, so far as it i s possible, the personality - the working of the material brain and enables you to ca tch the rh ythm, wherein is the answer to your question. So you ask whether you sha ll obtain something eagerl y desired, and the rhythm sings to you the idea of Ac quisitio and you set down the geomantic figure, and there appears to you the hier oglyphic of the Cups and you know that you hold forth the material cup, and behi nd the veil the spiritual cup is held forth to receive the wine of blessing. And now because there must be some name by which you shall call that divine spirit which yo u have perceived, you are taught to give it the name of Hismael. Take this if you wish to be a purely fanc y name. Wh ile it is the name you are to know, think of that spirit and you know so far t hat it is a genial generous spirit that gives you what you desire, and as such you recogniz e this spirit as the ruler of the idea of \"Acquisitio.\" You learn also the sigil of Hismae l. You do not know the meaning of this, or why it is employed. Perhaps you never will . It is not very important. You will never probably know the origin of the letter `J,' b ut this does not prevent you knowing that `J' is the initial of J ohn, the name of"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 32 your friend. To help in the knowledge and recogniti on of the Geomantic figures, the old books give various characteristics describing Hismael. For instance, as noble and generous and affable; a genial and han dsome man, laughter-loving, a great lover and forgiver. Descriptions are also giv en of the places that he most frequents. Fruits, plants and trees are so especially favoured by him, precious stones, animals, birds and fishes consonant to his nature, etc. But the student need not be concerned with those at present. They belong to mor e advanced parts of the subject. The chief points to note now are that we have seen the lines or strokes he makes are not haphazard and meaningless but reveal to him a c ertain rhythm and that rhythm is the expression of an idea. The idea is the answer t o the question shown him by the ruler whose name and sigil also he knows and somewh at of his character. Having grasped this much there will be less difficu lty in comprehending the meaning of the Genii, Angels, Archangels, etc. We see then how we get a certain result with one fi gure resulting from four lines of strokes. But there are four quarters of th e world, and four elements. We must inquire four times if we would have a reliable answ er. So it is necessary to make 16 lines of strokes resulting in four figures. But the principle of all is the same. We have discovered here only \"Acquisitio.\" Further comments must be reserved for a future paper. ASTROLOGY The Knowledge Lectures contain tid-bits of a variet y of topics. None of these do more than scratch the surface. This is admitted by Mathers in a paper devoted to describing the \"least amount of information a stude nt needs to pass the necessar y examinations.\" After awhile the astrological materi al - apart from naming the planetary and zodiacal symbols and their attributio ns to the Tree of Life - was dropped altogether. If not in the Golden Dawn, at l east a generation later in the Stella Matutina. The reason for this deletion was a simple one - the gradual appearance of some very well-written books on Astro logy. At the time the Order was founded, there was a dearth of good astrological bo oks, so the Knowledge Lectures were needed to make good what publishers and writer s had failed to do. Any good catalogue from a reliable occult bookseller will re veal nowdays practically hundreds of titles of astrological books. Not all of them ar e good by any manner or means. Nonetheless, a certain number are outstanding. Though I have left some of the basic astrological m aterial intact in the Knowledge Lectures, I would like to name a few good textbooks that the reader could consult to considerable advantage. For exampl e, there are the two books by Grant Lewi - Astrology° . for the Millions and Heaven Knows What (Llewellyn Publications). A more complete and comprehensive te xtbook, though nowhere as well written or as interesting, is the A-Z Horoscope Maker and Delineator by Llewellyn George. Perhaps the best of the lot is a series of slim volumes covering every phase of astrology b y Noel Tyl (Llewellyn"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 33 Publications). There is also a specializing volume on one particular topic that should not be ignored - Saturn b y Liz Greene (Samuel Weiser, Inc.) This can certainly supplant the skimpy and superficial data provided by the Knowledge Lectures. However, there are a couple of items to be found in different places throughout the Order teaching that deserve to be integrated in to the common body of astrological knowledge and practice. The data in the Tarot mater ial, relating to starting the Zodiac from the star Regulus in Leo, said to make t he signs and constellations coincide, is an important theoretical concept that must not be ignored. It makes the system similar to sidereal rather than tropical ast rology and therefore deserves a new system of interpretation. Furthermore, there is an isolated paper dealing with the Convolutions of the Serpent Formulae around the Nor th Pole, which has all sorts of hints and possibilities that only a student here an d there has sensed, to the best of my knowledge. ESOTERIC ASTROLOGY By FRANCIS KING Between 1908 and 1912 Mathers issued side lectures and other manuscripts to those Temples that were loyal to him. Much of this additional material reached the Stella Matutina (via Brodie Innes) but some did not do s o . . . S o m e of these later manuscripts are of great interest, and one in parti cular, that seems to have been issued to Theorici Adepti Minores, is of real importance; for it outlines an astrological system that differs in some respects from both the normal western astrology taught in the Golden Dawn and its offshoots, to members of the Portal Grade, and the sidereal (\"starry\") astrology used by the Hindus an d a minority of modern western astrologers. Therefore I would suggest the reader consult any of the modern textbooks on sidereal astrology with a view to gaining some insi ght into their particular kind of interpretation. (For example in tropical astrology m y ascendant is about 0 degrees Scorpio. By Mathers calculations that would be shif ted back to about the middle of Libra. And I can assure the reader that my basic ch aracteristics are no more Libran than the man in the moon. I.R.). In considering this `initiated astrology' it must b e borne in mind that the signs of the Zodiac in popular astrology are completely o ut of step with the constellations bearing the same names. The situation has arisen be cause of the precession of the equinox - the fact that the equinoctial point (i.e. the point of the zodiac at which the sun lies when it crosses the equator on March 21st each year) moves steadily through the zodiac in a reverse direction to the motion of the planets. In spite of this fact, tropical astrologers insist on calling this invisib le, moving equinoctial point to the 0 degrees of Aries although it is, in reality, many d egrees awa y from the constellation of that name."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 34 In Mathers' s ystem the moving, or tropical, zodiac is abandoned in favour of a fixed sidereal zodiac in which the signs and conste llations coincide and is measured from the star called Regulus, which is taken as bei ng in 0 degrees Leo. This sidereal zodiac requires a correction to the tropical longit udes given in all ephemerides (lists of planetary and zodiacal positions) used by astrol ogers - and this correction varies each year. Mathers supplied a table of these correc tions for the years 1800-1911. As it seems likely that some of the readers of this book will have astrological interests - a recent poll showed that no less than twenty percent of the adult population of England and Wales take astrology seriously I think it worth reproduction. In each case Column I indicated the year and Column II indicated the degrees and minutes to be subtracted from the planetary and house positions a s calculated from an ephemeris. This is the end of the quotation from Mr. King's us e of McGregor Mathers' segment on Esoteric Astrology. The dates end at the year of 1911, but I would gather one could proceed from that date to the present fol lowing more or less the same procedure. Anyway the student versed in sidereal as trology should have no difficulty in dealing with this schema. The tropical astrologe r likewise ought to be able to use the above data to his advantage and bring it up to date."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 35 INTRODUCTORY PAPER ON THE TATTWAS By G.H. FRATER SUB SPE THE TATTWAS I. What the Tattwas are. The conditions which make all life possible on the earth, whether human, animal or vegetable, are derived from the Sun: e.g. , light, heat, electricity, magnetism etc. This is termed `the life of the Sun' or `Solar Prana'. The Solar Prana is communicated to the earth in waves of vibration thr ough the ether. These waves are of widely varying lengths and rates of motion but they are all traversing the ether at the same time, forming a very complicated s ystem. The student should endeavour to familiarize himself with this conception. He will find a useful illustration in the sounds of a great orchestra: all the sound waves, from the long slow heavy ones of the bassoon, to th e short high rapid notes of the fife or piccolo -- are all passing at the same time to t he ear, yet the sensitive ear can pick out and follow the waves of sound proceeding from e ach instrument. Another illustration is found in the waves of colour procee ding from a landscape; the heavy long red waves and all the gamut of colour up the s hortest and most rapid blues are traversing the luminiferous ether at the same time yet the eye can pick out each one without trouble. The same idea can be visualized by considering the waves of the sea: the long heavy rollers pass along, and on their surface we c an see multitudes of small, short and rapid waves, passing simultaneously in the same direction. Now just as the notes of a musical scale are divided into seven distinct tones, each representing a certain number of aerial"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 36 vibrations per second; and just as the vibrations o f the luminiferous ether are divided into the seven colours of the spectrum -- s o the vibrations of the Solar Prana are divided into seven groups, groups which are det ermined by their wave lengths and frequencies. Two of these groups are beyond the sco pe of this paper, but the remaining five will be briefly explained. The Solar Pranas will be best understood by conside ring their effects on visible and tangible matter, and should always be c alled by their Sanscrit names, which having no other connotation, will be less lia ble to confusion. Consider then first the process by which the Mulapr akriti or `world stuff is moulded into a planet. At first it is inert, at res t as it were, a formless cloud of finely distributed matter having in itself only the potent ial of form and substance; this is the condition known as AKASA. Then motion begins, the m ass is whirled into a spherical form and becomes a nebula. This condition is called VAYU. Now imagine the infinitesimally small particles, wh irled around and continually colliding with each other, gradually gr owing hot and incandescent, until the nebula becomes a fiery mass. This condition is called TEJAS. Gradually it cools but remains fluid; this condition is called APAS. F urther, as time goes on, the fluid mass solidifies and becomes a globe or planet. In t his condition it is termed PRITHIVI. These names should be accurately learned and associ ated with the conditions to which they refer. It will be seen that they corr espond with fair accuracy to those states of energy --matter which are commonly called the four elements. Thus Vayu has qualities of Air, Tejas of Fire. Apas of Water and Prithivi of Earth. But as these words are limited in common speech, it is not advis able to use them in speaking or thinking of the Tattwas. Akasa in this connection w ould represent the negative or passive condition of rest. Another useful illustrat ion may be found by considering the operation of the Tattwas in reverse order: as in th e familiar chemical compound known as H 2 0, recognized in its fluid form as water. If this b e subjected to refrigeration it becomes solid, called in the terminology of the ele ments, Prithivi -- or `Earth'. This state results from the action of Prithivi on H 2 0. Now suppose heat is applied: the chunk of ice melts and the substance returns to its elemental state --Water. It is now under the Tattwa of Apas. Continue to increase the heat under the Tattwa of Tejas and the water becomes steam, or vapour and is thus unde r the Tattwa of Vayu. The Steam diffuses, it enters the Tattwa condition of Akasa, with the potential of condensing and returning to earth as rain. From these illustrations the student should be able to gain a clear conception of the nature of the Tattwas, regarding them always as more or less arbitrary divisions of the Solar Prana."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 37 II. The S ymbols of the Tattwas. It has been found convenient to denote each Tattwa by a conventional symbol --specialized as to figure, form and colour. These symbols are not arbitrarily selected, but are derived from the form of the wave, its freq uency and its formative effect on the etheric substance. This, however, is so complex and difficult an investigation that the student is advised to defer its considerat ion for the present, and consider the symbols as being merely conventional forms sufficie ntly appropriate to make them easy to remember. Thus the Akasa is symbolized by a n egg-shaped figure in dark purple or indigo. An egg as the root and origin of life is manifestly appropriate as a symbol of life -- the latency of the life force, th e force within the egg before it is stimulated into overt activity; and purple is emine ntly a colour of rest. Vayu is symbolized by a circle of clear blue, the a ir being obviously a sphere of blue colour. There is some difference of opinion as to the correct shade of blue, which varies with different persons: the best rule is to try and reproduce the deepest and most beautiful sky blue the student has ever se en. If he has been in the East or on the Mediterranean, he will see Va yu a darker, deepe r shade than if he has never been out of the northern latitudes. Tejas is symbolized by a triangle of flame red, the shape and colour being both obviously appropriate. Apas is symbolized by a cres cent in silver, alluding to the Moon as ruler of the waters, and their silvery colour wh en not reflecting the sky or any earthly object. Prithivi is symbolized by a square form of a yellow colour, the stability of earth being denoted by the square or cube; since the perfect form of earth according to the alchemists is gold, the colour yel low is appropriate. The student should now thoroughly acquaint himself with these forms and endeavour to imagine or visualize them in connectio n with the manifestation of the appropriate elemental state. Thus when the shades o f night are descending and he is sinking to sleep, let him imagine a vast egg-shaped cloud of deep purple light closing round and enveloping him in warm mysterious darknes s, the home of dreams. Whenever he looks on the sky, or on the distant hil ls, tinted to soft shades in the blue air, let him imagine the blue sphere of Vayu floati ng colossal in size before his eyes; through this see the landscape. So again if he looks on any fire, whether it be the fire on the domestic hearth, a furnace, a bonfire, or a volcano in eruption, let h im imagine the vast red triangle of Tejas before his eyes. Again looking on any water: the sea, a river, lake, or even the water in his own hand basin, let him train himself to see the silver crescent with the points turned upward. Over anything hard and solid let him see the yellow cube of Prithivi, imagining that if the visualized symbol w ere in solid form it would be like pure gold. When this exercise has been practiced till some deg ree of perfection is reached, it can be benefical to reverse the process thus: ta ke a lump of ice and put it in a heavy saucepan. It should now need no effort to see over it a yellow cube or square. Now bring the pan near a"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 38 fire; when the surface of the ice begins to melt an d water pours down its sides imagine the silver crescent appearing gradually on the yellow square, occupying about one quarter of its area. Make this grow brighter an d clearer as the ice becomes liquid; then when the block is nearly melted imagine the si lver crescent increasing in size and gradually replacing the yellow square altogethe r, so that when the ice has liquified the crescent alone remains. Now put the saucepan on the fire, and watch the wat er growing hot. As it does so imagine the red triangle of Tejas forming itself on the crescent, just as the crescent did on the square, until when the water boils, the red triangle will have replaced the crescent. As the steam rises and floats into the ai r the student should similarly see the red triangle becoming charged with the blue cir cle; this should increase in siz e and overshadow the triangle entirely as the water i s changed into steam. Then as the steam cloud disperses and becomes mere latent moist ure in the air, the blue circle should merge into the purple egg of Akasa. This exe rcise will familiarize the student with the idea of the Tattwa symbols, charged with w hat are known as their subtattwas. At this stage it will be useful for him to make a s eries of cards with the Tattwa symbols. These should be about the size and proport ion of playing cards. The length of the symbol should not be more than one half the maximum length of the card: i.e., if the card is four inches long, the symbol should be two inches, leaving an inch above and an inch below it. The s ymbols should be e x actl y and carefully cut in coloured paper or painted, the proportions true, an d the edges smooth. The cards should be kept scrupulously clean. The student shou ld now train himself when looking at the cards to recall some form of the ele ment to which each is attributed: thus a calm sea with Apas, a rough windy sea with A pas charged w ith Vayu, a boiling spring with Apas charged with Tejas, etc. Gradually he will find the symbol and the element b elonging to that symbol linked so closely together in his mind that one inv oluntarily recalls the other: for instance the mere thinking of Tejas will make him f eel warm on a cold da y. III. Of the S wara and the Breaths. Swara is the Spirit, the Soul of the Universe. Or a s it is said in the Sanscrit work on the science of breath: `It is the manifesta tion of the impression on matter of that power which knows itself'. Therefore it is cal led the Great Breath. Now breath is dual: out breathing and inbreathing. In the East th e technical symbol of out breathing is `SA', and the point of rest between the two is ` HAM', whence the word HAMSA, which is taken to mean God and which is a s ymbolic representation of the two eternal processess. Now as Swara is the Soul of the Universe, it follow s that everything that has life must partake of the nature of Swara: we expect to find positive and negative action in the Solar Prana, of which the Tattwas are modifications. Moreover in physical matter prepared for the reception of life -- as an egg -- we expect to find a center capable of manifesting the two forms of the life current. Thus in an egg, during incubation, we find the formation of two centers; f rom these eventually develop the brain-nerve system, and the heart-blood system;"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 39 each of these has a double function as it develops. So also is it with man, and with every created thing that has life, and even wi th the world itself. The Solar P rana comes either direct from the S un to Earth, or is reflected from the Moon. The former is said to be positive, t he latter negative. Therefore when under the influence of Swara, the Solar Prana is positive and the technical name is Sun Breath; when it is negative it is called Moo n Breath. The student is advised for the present to regard these merel y as technical ter ms, and not to attempt to trace the analogies farther; the subject is very complex. The Moon Breath manifested through the S olar P rana is termed IDA and the S un Breath is called PINGALA; the neutral point of rest between the two is SUSUMNA. Now Ida manifests especially in the nerves on the left side of the body, Pingala in those on the right and Susumna in the ce ntral column. Hence it is said that when the Solar Prana is in Ida, if the breath be dr awn in with a quick inspiration it is felt chiefly in the left nostril, and if in Pingala in the right. The student is advised not to put too much store in such experiments at first for: (1) the slightest cold in the head will often prevent or alter the sensations; (2) many illnesses, it is said, bring the breath to the wrong side; (3) the breath can be altered at will so as to be perceptible on one side or the other, as is done in certain magical processes. It should also be understood tha t the so-called change of breath from one side to the other is more a matter of sens ation arising from the functioning of the nerves, than an actual flowing o f material air; of all this more will be said hereafter. Now the course of the breaths in the Solar Prana ca n be calculated so that it is possible to know exactly what breath is in action a t any moment of the day or night. This is judged by the Moon. As is well known, the M oon increases during a fortnight, called the Bright Fortnight. The Bright Fortnight begins from sunrise after the new Moon. Observe -- this must be exact. Thus i f the Sun rises at 6 o'clock on a particular morning and the new Moon at 6:30, the Br ight Fortnight will begin on the following day at sunrise. The Solar Prana is then i n Ida, and the breath will be in the left nostril for the space of two hours (called in Sanscrit one `Ghari'); then the breath will change to Pingala, and be in the right nostril for another two hours. Alternating throughout the whole twenty-four hours, it passes t hrough twelve Gharis in the course of a da y and night. Between each Ghari occurs S usumna which lasts for a bout twent y minutes, the transition period, i.e., ten minutes during whi ch the breath is passing from the side which was active to the central position, wher e it is in both nostrils equally, and ten minutes getting fully developed in the othe r nostril, with a very brief interval when it is exactly equal in both. This continues for three days, changing on the four th day. On the first Ghari after sunrise on the fourth day the Solar Prana is in Pingala, and the breath in the right nostril. On the second Ghari it changes to Id a, and so on for three da ys. On the seventh day it changes again back to Ida, for the f irst Ghari. Thus it is clear that the third twenty-four hours will end with Pingala and t he fourth will begin with the same. The sixth will end with Ida and"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 40 the seventh begin with the same. Moreover owing to the increase or decrease of daylight hours the periods of twenty-four hours will not be exact. This course is continued until the full Moon. At the time of the first sunrise after the full Moo n, i.e., the beginning of the Dark Fortnight -- the S olar P rana is in P ingala, wh ether the preceding term of three da ys has been completed or not; and the same proces s is gone through again until the following new Moon. Now during each Ghari the five Tattwas come successively into operation beginning with Akasa. Each therefore will be of about twenty minutes duration. Thus suppose the sun rises at 8 o'clock, Akasa will be current till 8:20, Vayu from 8:20 to 8:40, Tejas from 8:40 to 9:00 and so o n. During Ida the Tattwas will be of a negative character, and during Pingala positiv e. Moreover each Tattwa is divided into five Subtattwa s, the course of which is commenced b y a S ubtattwa of its own nature. Thus Va yu commences with Va yu charged with Va yu that is the simple Tattwa which l asts for four minutes and is followed by Va yu ch arged with Tejas, then Va yu with Apas and so on. The last is Va yu-Akasa followed b y Tejas charged with Tejas, Te jas charged with Apas etc. These of course are symbolized by the ca rds the stu dent has alread y prepared. It will be seen that the Tattwa or breath in operation at any moment of the day or night, of any da y in the year, can be instantly and easil y calculated. An adept who is in perfect health and has sufficien tly trained his faculties can discover without calculation which Tattwa is in ope ration by various simple methods. One of these is to place five small balls or marbles, painted with the Tattwa colours, in his pocket and draw out one haph az ard; this ball should be of the colour of the Tattwa in operation. Another method i s to close the eyes and endeavour to see a colour; the first that comes to the mind should be that of the ruling Tattwa. As has been said this depends on perfect health, an d also training: the student must not expect to attain success until after consi derable practice. When he has practiced for some time he will also find that he c an perceive the physical effects of the Tattwas at the time when they are in operation. Thus when Vayu functions he may expect a certain feeling of restlessness, in Te jas warmth and energy, in Apas a cold phlegmatic sensation and in Prithivi steadines s and solid strength. These feelings will be ver y slight and at first, only bar el y perceptible, but with time and practice they will become more distinct, and may be ver y useful in determining when to perform certain actions. If a man is making a call and has no reason whatever for leaving at one time or another he is a lmost certain to go as soon as Va yu is well established. It will follow that if he desires to do something d emanding energy, he had better wait till the Tejas Tattwa, or the Sun Breath is in operation; if a material business is to be commenced it will probabl y be b est done un der the Prithivi Tattwa. S o again a work of imagination or an y negative or rece ptive undertaking will prosper most under Ida, the Moon Breath."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 41 By making a chart of the Breaths, Tattwas, and Subt attwas through each day for some time, and carefully trying to notice their effect in himself, the student ma y in short time attain to a very competent knowledge of the subject, and acquire a perception of the course of the Solar Prana which w ill be of great assistance to him in his future work. But let him beware of premature ly trying to test the existence of the Tattwas by experimenting to see if he can feel them; in so doing he starts with a suggestion to himself that they do not exist. This will infallibly blunt the very delicate instrument of his sensation, and cause the failure of his efforts, as well as loss and damage to his powers.

However, there is an interesting and most useful simplified approach to the whole topic of the Tattwas in The Law of the Rhythmic Breath by Ella Adelia Fletcher (R.F. Fenno & Co., N .Y. 1908), dedicated to Rama Prasad. I do not know if this book is still in print, though use d copies may still be available. If a sufficient demand is created, I fancy that Health Research mig ht be persuaded to bring out a photographic edition of this too. I.R.) General Observation There are five Tattwas or Principles: 1. Akasa -- Ether. 2. Vayu -- the Aerial principle. 3. Tejas -- the Principle of Light and Heat. 4. Apas -- Watery Principle. 5. Prithivi -- the Earthy Principle. But the first Cause of these is the Great Controller of all things, the One Light, the Formless. From Him first came into appearance Ether ; thence the Air, the motion producing Ether waves which causes Light and Heat, and so on in the above order. The Yogi comes to know the principle of these five Tattwas, their Sukshma Sharira, but how? Further on you will see how. The Astrologer who has no knowledge of the Swara is as worthless as a man without a wife. It is the soul i tself; it is the Swara, the Great Controller of all, who creates, preserves, and destroys, and caus es whatsoever is in this World. Experience and Tradition both say no knowledge is more preciou s than this knowledge of the Swara. None else lays bare the workings of the machinery of thi s world, or the secret workings of this world. By the power of Swara may be destroyed an enemy. Pow er, wealth, and pleasure, all these can be commanded by Swara. The beginner in ou r Science must be pure and calm in mind and in thought, virtuous in actions, and having unm ixed faith in his spiritual teacher. He must be strong in his determination, and grateful. Swara in the Body. Ten manifestations of this Swara are in the body. But before the Neophyte is told this, he must gain a thorough know ledge of the nervous system. This is very important, and according to his knowledge of this s cience, the Neophyte gains success. To give a rough outline of the parts we have chiefly to dea l with in our endeavour to explain the elementary treatise. There are ten principal nerves , this includes the tubes, etc. It is in the ten manifestations of Swara that the ten so-called Vayu s move. We mean by this ten forces which perform ten different functions. The three most imp ortant nerves are the following, as the beginner has only to deal with these:"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 43 1. Ida, the left bronchus. 2. Pingala, the right bronchus. 3. Sushumna, in the middle. The ten Vayus are: 1. Prana, in the breast. 2. Apana, about the excretory organs. 3. Samana, in the navel. 4. Udana, middle of the throat. 5. Vyana, pervading the whole body. 6. Kurmana, the eyes, helping them open. 7. Kirkala, in the stomach, producing hunger. 8. Nag, whence comes vomiting. 9. Devadatta, causes yawning. 10. Dhananjaya, that which doth not leave the body after death. These ten Vayus, or forces, have their play in the ten principal nerves, not one in each. They are the regulators of the body of man. If they go on working properly, a man remains perfectly healthy; if not, different kinds of disea ses spring up. A Yogi keeps them always working, and consequently diseases never come to him. The key to all these nerves lies in the working of the Prana Vayu, or vital principle drawing the air through the Ida, the Pingala, and the Sushumna. Whe n the Air is drawn through the Ida it is felt coming out or going in through the left nostril. Wh en through the Pingala, in the right nostril. When through the Sushumna it is felt through both no strils simultaneously. The air is drawn or felt through either or both of the nostrils at cert ain appointed times. Whenever in any given time, the Breath goes in and comes out of the wrong nostril it is a sure sign some sort of disease is coming on. The Ida is sometimes called the Chandra Nadi, or the Moon Nerve. The Pingala, the Surya Nadi or Sun nerve. These are called, the form er, the Chandra Swara and the latter the Surya Swara. The reason is that when the breath is in the Ida it gives coolness to the body, and that when in the Pingala it gives heat to the body. The Ancient Magi used to say the place of the Moon in the human body was in Ida, and the Sun in P ingala. The Course of the Breath. The Lunar month, it is we ll known, is divided into two parts, the fortnight of the Waxing and the fortnight of th e Waning. On the first fortnight, or the Bright Fortnight, just at Sunrise of the first day the Bre ath must come into the left nostril and must be so for the three succeeding days, when again the 7t h day must begin with the Moon breath, and so on in the same order. Thus we have said that suc h and such days begin with such and such breath."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 44 But how long is our breath to remain in one nostri l? For five Gharis, or 2 hours. Thus when the first day of the Bright fortnight beg ins with the Moon Breath, after five Gharis, the Sun Breath must set in, and this again must cha nge into the Moon Breath after the same interval of time. So on for every day. Again, the first day of the dark fortnight must beg in with the Sun Breath, and proceed in the same way, changing after five Gharis and the th ree succeeding days. It will be seen that all the days of the month have been divided into the Id a and the Pingala. In the Sushumna, the Swara flows only when it changes, either in its nat ural course or in certain other conditions to be afterwards mentioned. This is the course of Natu re. But a Yogi commands Nature. He turns everything into his own way. Rules for this will be given in the proper place. (Coloured illustrations of the tattwas will be found in the c olour plate section of this book). COURSE OF THE TATT WAS For five Gharis, as we have above said, the breath flows through our nostrils. In these 5 Gharis, or two hours periods, the Tattwas h ave their course. In the first we have Akasa, in the second Vayu, in the third Tejas, in the four th Apas, in the fifth Prithivi. Thus in one night and day, or 6O Gharis, we have twelve courses of th ese 5 Tattwas, each remaining one Ghari and returning again in two hours. There are again f urther five subdivisions of each Tattwa in a Ghari. Thus, Akasa is subdivided into Akas-Akasa; A kas-Vayu; Akas-Tejas; Akas-Apas; Akas- Prithivi and similarly with the other four. How to know which of the Tattwas is at a certain t ime in course, not merely by a mathematical calculation but with the certainty of an eye witness, is of the greatest importance in the practical part of this science. We shall com e to it further on. The Ida. When the Breath is in Ida, that is in the left Nostril, then only is it well to perform the following actions. Stable works such as erecting a building, or the construction of a well or tank, going on a distant journey, entering a new house, collection of things, giving gifts, marriage, making jewels or clothes, taking medicine s and tonics, seeing a superior or master for any purpose of trade, amassing of wealth, sowing of seed in a field, negotiations, commencement of trade, seeing of friends, works of charity and faith, going home, buying of animals, doing work for the benefit of others, plac ing money on security, singing, dancing, taking up abode in any village or city, drinking or making water at the time of sorrow, pain, fever, etc. All these acts should be done when the Swara is in Ida. It must however be kept in mind that the Tattwas Vayu and Tejas are to be excl uded from these actions, likewise Akasa. During the Tattwas Prithivi and Apas only, are the se actions to be done. In a fever, the Yogi keeps his Chandra Swara going, and brings the Apas or Water Tattwa in course, so the fever is all over in a very short time. How mastery is gained over the Tattwas will come further on. The Pingala. In the Surya Swara only, are the foll owing actions to be done. Reading and teaching hard and difficult subjects of knowledge, sexual intercourse, shipping, hunting,"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 45 mounting a hill or fort, riding a donkey, camel or horse, swimming over a powerful stream or river, writing, painting, buying and sell ing, fighting with swords or hands, seeing a king, bathing, eating, shaving, bleeding, sleeping, suchlike. All these secure success and health, as the case may be, if done in the Surya Swara. The Sushumna. When the Breath comes not out of both nostrils at the same time, it is flowing in the Sushumna. Nothing ought to be done un der these conditions, for everything turns out badly. The same is the case when the Brea th is now in one and now in the other nostril. When this is the case, sit down and medita te upon or over the Sacred Hansa. This joining of the Breath is the only time for Sandha, meditation. NOTE: Zanoni secured success in gaming for Cetosa a nd overcame the effects of the poisoned wine of the Prince di D. as follows. In th e first place, he changed his breath to the right nostril, and threw an envelope of the Akasa T attwa over his antagonist, who consequently became all empty, the money in gaming flowing towar ds the Surya Swara. In the latter case he brought the Water, Apas, Tattwa into course, direct ed it with the full force of his trained will towards the poisoned wine, and consequently the bur ning heat of the poison was counteracted for a very long time, and before it could recover s trength enough to act on the system, it was there no longer. S.R.M.D. THE TATTWA To each of the five Tattwas a special colour has be en assigned. Akasa -- Black or Indigo. Vayu -- Blue. Tejas -- Red. Apas -- Silver. Prithivi -- Yellow. It is by these colours that a practical man finds on the spur of the moment whi ch Tattwa is at the time in course. Besides, these Tattwas have different shapes and tastes. The se figures are seen by taking a bright mirror and letting the breath fall upon it, as it comes out of the Nose. The divided part takes one of the following forms according to the Tattwa then in cou rse. Prithivi -- a square. Apas, a crescent. Tejas, a triangle. Vayu, a sphere. Akasa, egg shape d. To sum up their qualities: Prithivi -- moves always in the middle of the Paths of Air and Water. Apas -- downwards, straight through the nose. Tejas -- upwards. Vayu -- obliquely towards the right or left arm, as the case may be. Akasa -- transversely always.

For practice, take five littl e bullets or counters coloured: red, yellow, blue, silver, and black. Place or carry the m in a pocket. Now let him close his eyes and at random take one of them out of his pocket. The c olour of the bullet will be that of the Tattwa in course. While still keeping the eyes closed let him see if the colour of the bullet floats before the eyes. He must not suppose he will be correct immediately. Eventually the confusion will disappear, and well defined colours, more or less s table, will appear before him so that the colour of the bullet will be the same as that float ing before his eyes. Then he will have gained the power of knowing which of the Tattwas is in cour se, and can at will find them. There is a special method of the concentrating the mind and practising with the eyes for this purpose, which will come with practice. Let him ask any of his friends to imagine a flower. He will only have to shut his eyes to find the Tattwa then in course and he can astonish his friends by naming the colour of the flower. Again if a man sitting amongst his friends finds the Vayu active let him ascertain those of his friends who are healthy mentally and physica lly wish to go away. Let him ask them to answer frankly and they will say ‘yes’. In what way other Tattwas affect both the body and mind of man will be stated later. Some higher secrets are deliberately reserved for t hose who safely and honestly pass the elementary stage. When one has reached the stage of finding at Will any of the Tattwas, do not imagine you have become perfect. If one goes on practising his inner sight becomes ke ener so that he will recognize the five Tattwic subdivisions. Continue with the medita tions and innumerable shades of colour will be recognized according to the different proportions of the Tattwas. His work will be tedious while he is trying to distinguish between the diffe rent shades of colour. Tedious at first because when the many shades of colour become fixed and def ined by persevering practice he will see an ever changing rainbow of the most beautiful shade s of colour and for a time this will be sufficient food for his mind. To avoid the tediousness meditate upon the breath a s is laid down in the chapter on meditation on the Tattwas. Action to be taken during the different Tattwas. Ac tions of a sedate and stable nature as enumerated under the Chandra Swara are best done dur ing the course of Prithivi, the earthy principle. Those of a fleeting nature which are to be done and gone through quickly should be done during Apas. Actions such as a man has to make of a violent struggle to hold his own, are best done during Tejas. If a Yogi wishes to kill a man he should do so with the Vayu Tattwa. In the Akasa, nothing should be done but meditation, a s works begun during this Tattwa always end badly. Works of the above nature only prosper i n the specified Tattwas; and those whose actions prosper may see this by experiment."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 47 MEDITATION AND MASTERY OVER THE TATTWAS We have previously given summary rules for distingu ishing the various colours of the different Tattwas. But now we are going to explain the final method of mastering the Tattwas and of practising. This is a secret which was only imparted to the most promising Adepts of Yoga. But a short practise will fully show the impo rtant results to be gained by this practise. By degrees the student will become able to look int o the future at will and have all the visible world before his eyes, and he will be able to command Nature. During the day when the sky is clear let him once o r twice for about an hour or two withdraw his mind from all external things, and sit ting on a easy chair let him fix his eyes on any particular part of the blue sky and continue ga zing without allowing the eyes to blink. At first he will see the waves of the water, the water y vapour in the atmosphere. Some days later as the eyes become more practised he will see different sorts of buildings, etc. in the air. When the Neophyte reaches this state of practice he is sure of success. After this he will see different sorts of mixed col ours of Tattwas in the sky, which will show themselves in their proper and respective Tatt wic colours. To test the truth of this the Neophyte should occas ionally close his eyes during the practise, and compare what is floating in the sky w ith that which he sees inwardly. When both are the same the operation is right. Other tests ha ve been given before and other wonders will present themselves later to the Yogi. This practise is to be done in the day time. For the night, let the student rise about 2 AM. whe n everything is calm, when there is no noise and when the cold light of the stars breathe holiness and a calm rapture enters into the soul of man. Let him wash his hands, feet, the crow n of his head, and the nape of his neck with cold water. Let him put his shin bones to the groun d and let the back of the thighs touch his calfs, and let him put his hands upon his knees, hi s fingers pointing toward the body. Let him now fix his eyes on the tip of his nose. To avoid t ediousness he must always meditate on the inhalation and exhalation of his breath. Besides the above this has many other advantages de scribed elsewhere. It may be said here, by constant practise one is able to develop t wo distinct syllables in his thought. It is evident that when a man inhales a sound is produced like HAN. When exhaling the sound is SA. By constant practise, the breath becomes associ ated with these sounds so that effortlessly the mind understands HANSA in relationship to the T attwas. Thus we see that one full breath makes HANS A which is the name of the Ruler of the Universe together with His Powers. They are exerted during natural phenomena. At this stage of perfection the Yogi should commence as follows. Getting up at 2 or 3 in the morning and washing him self in the aforementioned manner, let him know and fix his mind upon the Tattwa then in course. If the Tattwa be Prithivi at that moment, think of it as something that is a yellow s quare, sweet smelling, small in size and able to eliminate all disease. Let him at the same time say LAM. It is very easy to imagine this."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 48 Much the same is true of the other Tattwas which ar e described in the chart above, which the student should again consult. However, be aware that the words VAM are related to Apas, RAM to Tejas, PAM to Vayu, and HAM to Akasa. By diligent practise these syllables become definit ely associated with the Tattwas. When he repeats them the special Tattwa appears wit h as much force as he may will, and thus it is that a Yogi can cause whatever he likes -- lightning, rain, wind, etc. CURE OF DISEASES Every disease causes the breath to flow out of the wrong nostril and the wrong Tattwa to come into course. When the breath is therefore rest ored to the proper nostril, and the proper Tattwa has been brought into course, do not expect that that is all to be done. If the disease be obstinate and the attack a violent one, one will ha ve to persevere a long time before success is gained. If success does not come quickly resort to use of t he appropriate medications and Swara will soon be restored. You may notice the Chandra Swara is generally the be st for the cure of any disease. Its flow is an indication of the soundness of health. I n colds, coughs and other diseases this Swara should flow. No one Tattwa or Swara causes pain if it flows prope rly. In this state it should not be unduly meddled with, but when any one Tattwa or Swa ra becomes overdominant and causes disease it should be changed at once. Experience sho ws that the Apas and the Prithivi Tattwas are the only ones generally good for health. Indeed the fact that during the course of the Apas Tattwa the breath is felt 16 fingers breadth below the nose and during the Prithivi 12 fingers, argues that at those times there is a more sound and powerful working of body functions than when it is felt only 8 or 4 or no finger breadths be low the nose. Akasa therefore is the worst for health and when si ck one would find Akasa, Vayu, or Tejas in course. When need be therefore proceed in the following man ner. After having changed the breath from the wrong nostril to the proper one, ge nerally the left, and pressing the opposite by a cushion so that it may not change readily again, sit on an easy chair and bind the left thigh a little above the knee joint with a handkerchief. Sh ortly he will perceive that the Tattwa changes to the one immediately below it and so on; and then the next, etc. If he be an acute observor of bodily conditions he will perceive that slowly his mind is becoming more easy. Then let him tighten his bandage still more. When at last he rea ches Prithivi, he will find his health a great deal better. Let him persevere in this state or sti ll better the Apas Tattwa for some time, and return to it occasionally for some days even after the disease has disappeared. Undoubtly he will be cured."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 49 FORECAST OF FUTURITY Although a Yogi obtains the power of knowing everyt hing that is, has been, or is to be, beyond the reach of the senses, yet generally he be comes indifferent to such knowledge. He forgets himself in his eternal presence before the Light, which breathes beauty into all we see in the world. We shall therefore represent him here re vealing if not all his knowledge of futurity then only specific questions put to him by others. But our Neophytes may as well put the questions themselves, and then answer them accordin g to the laws here laid down. When a Yogi is asked a question, let him: (a) Determine what Tattwa is in course. If it be Pr ithivi then the question is about something in the vegetable kingdom or where t he element earth is dominant. (b) If it be Apas the question relates to life, bir th, death, etc. (c) If Tejas the question concerns metals, gain or loss, etc. (d) If Akasa the questioner has nothing to ask. (e) If Vayu it relates to a journey. These are but elementary things. The practical Yogi who can distinguish between the mixture of the Tattwas can name the particular thing s. Now let him determine through which of his nostrils the breath is flowing, which is the fortnight then in course of passing, which the days and what direction of himself, the enquirer. If the breath comes through the left nostril, to se cure complete success the work which is the subject of the question and which will be spe cified under IDA, he must have the following coincidences. The fortnight must be brigh t. The day must be even, the direction must be east or north. If these things coincide the ques tioner will get what he wants. Again if the Surya and Swara coincide with a dark f ortnight, the day odd, the direction south and west, a similar result will be predicted, but only partially. The action will be of the sort described under Pingala. If any of these coincide, the success will vary. It must be remembered that the breath at the time must not be flowing through the wrong nost ril. If the wrong Swara is at the commencement of the da y the wrong Swara arises, the Lunar for the Solar or vica versa, one may expect s omething wrong. If it happens the first day there is sure to be some sort of anxiety. If the se cond some loss of money. If the third there will be a journey. If the fourth some dear object will b e destroyed. If the fifth, loss of Kingdom. If the sixth loss of everything. If the seventh illnes s and pain are sure to come. If the eighth, death. If the Sun breath flows in the morning and at noon, and the Moon in the evening, a sad discomforture will result, the reverse being a sign of Victory. If a man, about to travel which coincides in direct ion with the empty nostril at the time, he will not get what he desires."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 50 ALCH EMY By V.H. FRATER A.M.A.G. There are within the Knowledge Lectures innumerable references to Alchemy, and there are some minor eluci dations of alche mical terms wit h di agrams of one type or a nother. There were some so-called Flying Rolls on the subje ct - non-official papers written either by the Chie fs or by some of t he more well-informe d mem bers. None of them are really illuminating and throw very little light on the sub ject. Finally, there is the section on Al chemy in that most remarkable doc ument Z-2, whi ch essentially breaks down the Neophyte Ritual into a variety of many points which can then be applied to different topics. One of them was Alchemy. But unless you obtained an alchemical orientation from some other source , (such as from Fra ter Albertus of the Paracelsus College in Salt Lake City, Ut ah) that schema was not going to be very illumina ting. Yet, historical data are firm in their statement th at some of the Rosicrucian societies that sprang up in Germany some c onside ra ble time after t he appe arance of t he three Rosicrucian manifestoes did actually teach Alchemy. But the Golden Dawn did not, to the best of my knowledge - apart from the above named r eferences. Yet i n re cent months I have heard from a Temple des ce nded from the original Fel kins group affirming that Alchemy has been and still is taught as part of their basic Rosicrucian Curriculum. Beyond that affirmative information I h ave no specific knowledge of what that entails. But it is encouraging to learn that this p articular branch of Occult knowledge is not being ne glected by t he Order. One of the older clerical members of the Order, the Rev. W. Ayton, who is usually but proba bly unfairl y described as a doddering old drea me r, did practic e or experiment with"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 51 Alchemy. What he did with it and what he accomplish ed is not known to the world at large. But rumor has it that he and some other clerics of the Golden Dawn were Latin scholars who translated some of the more famous hermetic tex ts into English. Apparently they were n ot an xio us t o b e id entifi ed wi th t hat su bj ect - n o d o ubt for fear of c en sur e fr o m th eir ecclesiastical superiors.

So the alchemists sought to intervene by their art - to speed up the process of growth and evolution, and so to aid God's work.\" The following is an essay written on Alchemy, by Ha ns Nintzel; it is quoted in full with his kind permission. ALCHEMY By HANS W. NINTZEL `Lately there is a revival of interest in Alchemy. Whereas a few years ago, the very word was hardly mentioned in polite conversation, we are now seeing an occasional article or book being devoted to the subject. We even find Alc hemy being taught as a subject in some Universities. Accordingly, it seems well to set dow n some basic ideas to explain what Alchemy is, its roots, and perhaps, what it is not. This Holy Science is of such great importance, even more so today than it was yesterda y, that a great many readers may profit by some additional ideas on this seemingly recondit e subject. We can start with the universal idea that alchemists are those who turn l ead into gold. While there is the seed of truth in this notion, there is much more to it than that. And what can be more valuable than gold? In fact. if you asked this question, you are really in need of Alchemy. First of all, the alchemists, modern and medieval, followed a certain credo. Their goal was to alleviate the suffering of their fellow man. Physically and spiritually. One such means was to produce medicines that could aid man's progress in both realms. That is, a medicine or `Elixir' could be made that produced a dichotomous effect in that physical problems could be alleviated from the usage of an a lchemically produced medicine. Moreover, this elixir could act as the agent to pur ge the body of those dross matters that inhibited the finer vibrations from being received. While Alchemy was definitely an attempt to demonstrate, from the physical viewpoint , experimentally and on the material plane, the validity of certain philosophical views of the Universe, its end goal was the exaltation of its subjects. T hat subject, in additi on to others, was man himself. A one word definition of Alchemy would be `evolutio n.' This in turn can be thought of as being synonomous with `transmutation,' although thi s latter term has a connotation of instantaneous action. By evolution we mean the (usu ally) gradual change of something from a base or coarse existence into something fine r, more noble. In the mineral kingdom, the age-old analogy quickly comes to mind, that is: lead becomes gold. However, this concept is also extended to the animal kingdom and man. That is, man in his crude, self- centred, ignoble state can be transmuted into a fin e, loving, God-centred person. A more spiritual person. Everyone, I am sure, can relate t o this idea and, in fact, many of us,"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 53 deep down, yearn for this evolution, this transmuta tion. We may not think of it in terms of Alchemy, but who has never felt that call to rid th emselves of the coarse outer garments and become more spiritual, closer to the Creator? T his is the goal of Alchemy, this transmutation, this evolution. However, the alchemi st takes these ideas a few steps further and declares that ALL things are evolving. Not only man, but all creatures in all kingdoms. Plants and herbs are evolving, cats and dogs are ev olving, rocks and metals are evolving, in fact, this entire planet is in a state of upward ev olution. The earth aspires to become enlightened, like the Sun. This perhaps startling concept is fundamental to Al chemy. It says, among other things, that all base creatures are gradually becoming fine r creatures. Man is evolving from his base, brute-like beginnings to a beautiful, saintly creature. Metals are evolving from their base beginnings, as lead, to a more noble existence as gold. Nor does anything have to be done to insure this transmutation or evolution. Slo wly, but surely, ALL things will arrive at their zenith on the evolutionary scale. It is as if we were on a huge upwinding spiral. This spiral slowly winds its way `heavenward. ' If nothing was done to hasten this evolutionary action, or to impede it, one day all would arrive a t the goal: full spiritual evolution. However, by alchemical processes, this evolution in all creatures can be hastened. That is, man can volitionally speed up the cycle of evolutio n for himself or for other creatures creatures unable to have any effect on their own sp iritual growth. By the same token, God has given man free will and with this, man can impede his own progress. At given times, as we look about us, we s uspect that the evolutionary process has turned into a devolution. This is NOT the case, alt hough individuals can elect to sink back into the material mire from which others struggle t o escape. Another way of looking at this is to state that the purpose of Alchemy is to raise the rate of vibrations of both the practitioner (man) and his subjects. These subjects may be medicaments or mineral compositions. J ust how one can use Alchemy to more rapidly approach Divinity will be touched on, but let us look briefly at the history of alchemy first. Some ideas about the roots of Alchemy may provide a stronger foundation upon which other ideas and understanding can be built. Looking to the past, we find that Egyptian goldsmiths existed about 3000 B.C. and around 3500 B.C., Sumerian metalworkers practised their trade in Mesopotamia. In China and India, in remote times, (as well as today, of course), gold was looked upon as a magica l medicine. Alchemical ideas arose in China as early as the fifth century B.C. Chinese Al chemy is closely allied with Taoism, a system containing philosophy and religion. T hey bel ieved in the curative, and even life- extending properties of jade, pearl and cinnabar. T hese ideas were picked up by subsequent practitioners of the art, moving to Gree ce, through Europe and finally, through other parts of the western world - ideas that are a s strong today as they were then. Alchemy was also as indicated above, in Greece. It is known that during the Alexandrian period, 4th to 7th century A.D., Alchemy flourished . As did other cultures, the Greeks added to the body of Alchemy, various ideas and pra ctices peculiar to themselves."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 54 J ust pre cise l y wh ere Alc he my o r i gi nat ed is no t rea l l y kn o wn .

T he people, tall and black-hai red, eventually mixed with the tribes of the Near East. T he Hebrews referred to them as Sume rians. T hey knew how to work with tin, gold, silver, copper, lead, antimony, and iron . Copper and tin produced the bronze so common to the Sumerians and the Indus civilisations . Artifacts were discovered here such as leaden goblets, iron daggers and a vase made of pure antimony.

Whatever its origin, certain basic ideas are found to be common to all the cultures in which Alchemy flourished. One such idea is the prin ciple of the four elements as being the basic foundation of all Alchemy. In China, we find five elements, but the notion is the same. The philosophy of the four elements is classically attributed to Aristotle who postulated the e xist en ce of f our f un da me nt al `q ualit ies ' i mb u ed i n all b odi es. T h ese wer e the hot a nd moist, along with their opposites, the cold and dry . To these `qualities' were assigned the s ymb o lis m o f the f our ma t eri al ele me nts , fir e, air , water , a nd ea rth . T h e y were s ee n as h a vin g t heir ori gi n via c o nj ucti ons of t hes e fo ur p r op ertie s. It mi gh t be n ote d t hat th e symbol for fire is opposite to the symbol of water and water is the inversion or opposite of fire. T he symbol for air is the fire symbol with a line through it. If we combine the polar opposites, with their dual aspects, we obtain a fam iliar symbol of the Shield of Solomon, t he Hex a gr a m. It is t he s ymb o l of th e un it y o f th e op po site s.

The idea of a prima materia is a basic c oncept extant in Indian literature under the name of 'Mulaprakriti. ' In Chinese alchemy, we find this idea expressed as `T'ai Chi.' These very basic Alchemical theories were further refined and expanded in the course of time, and they gave rise to certain ideas that are with us to day. That is, the principle that all things are composed of three essential constituents or bases. These three, known in Indian literature as the `three Gunas,' are called by alchemists, `Su lphur,\"Salt,' and `Mercury.' The ancient alchemists were prone to veil their writings in obs cure symbolism, mythology and various blinds. In this case, the principle of Sulphur is n ot common sulphur or brimstone. Salt did not indicate common table salt (sodium chloride), n or did Mercury reflect the matter found in thermometers, quicksilver. T here was an analog b etween these, but definitely not a one-to-one relationship. This blind hindered many a budding alchemist. It is interesting to note that one of these, Mercury, was referred back to the four elements and known as the `Quintessence,' a fifth principle, as found in Chin ese Alchemy where there are five elements: water, fire, wood, metal and earth. Now, the quinte ssence is also the prima materia, the T'ai Chi. It is from this UNITY, this ONE, that the law of Polar ity is derived. The `ONE' is God, the Divinity, the All. The duality of the law of Polarity is exemplified i n Chinese alchemy as the `Yin' and the `Yang.' T he female and the male, negativity and pos itivity, passivity or receptivity and dynamism or action. Yin and Yang were also associat ed with the moon and sun, respectively, while the five elements were associat ed with certain planets: Water with Mercury, Fire with Mars, Wood with Jupiter, Metals with Venus, and Earth with Saturn. Yin and Yang, the pair of opposites, are embodied i n many religious and alchemical philosophies. They are the Isis and Osiris of Egypt ian mythology, the Mercury and Sulphur of Alchemy, the concepts of hot and cold, good and evil, love and hate, etc, etc. In today's `alchemical circle' there is a maxim that combines all of these ideas. This maxim is stated as: \"The One became two by the law of Polarity which is revealed within the three essentials that will be found within the four elements, wherei n is to be found the Quintessence which is not of the four but one of the three.\" The principle of Sulphur is the principle of combus tion. It is the colour of subjects, in plants it gives the odour. T he Arabic alchemist, Ge ber, said sulphur is the \"fatness. \" Alchemists attributed to sulphur the principle of t he soul, the consciousness. In a `tincture' it is what tincts. It is the vitality in animals an d has the role of coagulation, to concentrate the life-force. It is red, hot, masculine, active a nd is symbolised by the Sun. It is associated with Gold. T he vital life-force or `prana' is the M ercury. T he Yin or feminine aspect, Mercury, endows gold with its lustre, even as Sulph ur endows it with its colour. Mercury is the basis for gold's malleability and fusibility. M ercury is the Spirit, the `Water of the Wise,' the Prima Materia, Luna, the seed or sperm of all t hings. Where Sulphur exhibits itself as an oily substance, Mercury is a volatile liquid in its corporeal forms. In the plant world, alcohol is the vehicle for the life-force, for Merc ury. Sulphur, in the plant world, is the"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 56 essential oils contained therein. Finally, Salt is the body of all matter. It is the basic principle of fixity and solidification. It confers resistance to the fire. In the plant world, the salt is the ash of the burned or calcined plant, us ually a grey-to-white `salty' substance. It is the medium in which Sulphur and Mercury can combine . T his `chemical marriage ' is brought about by the catalytic action of the Sa lt to bring Sulphur and Mercury to their earthly state. This un ion of the opposites, this marriage of the Sun and Moon, is the state sought after by alchemis ts. Such a state can be arrived at in all the kingdoms. Now, since all things already consist of these three principles, it is logical to say that one thing can be changed to another by var ying the proportion of these principles. That is, as Basil Valentine wrote: \"Iron is found t o have the least portion of Mercury but more of Sulphur and S a l t . . . Copper is generated of much Sulphur but its Mercury and Salt are in equality. . .Saturn (Lead) is generated of l ittle Sulphur, little Salt and much gross, unripe Mercury while Gold hath digested and refined the Mercury to a perfect ripeness. \" What Valentine is saying is that the metals are dif ferent due to the different proportions of the three essentials. In more modern parlance, cons ider the fact that if one brought together one proton and one electron and one neutron, an ato m of `heavy hydrogen' would be produced. Now, if we changed the proportions of the se three `essentials' by adding, for example, one additional proton and one additional e lectron, we would have an atom other than hydrogen. These subject matters are both gases but have very different characteristicts. So, by changing the ratio of the essentials, we have wound up with different matters. A transformation has taken place . It is conceded that making hydrogen into helium is no small task. However, in 1941 the physicists, Sherr, Bainbridge, and Anderson, succeeded in transmuting a radioactive is otope of mercury (quicksilver) into pure gold. To be sure, the cost of doing this was p rohibitive, and a linear accelerator had to be employed. But the point is, it was done. A trans mutation had taken place. We can put a cap on these ideas with a statement by an ancient a lchemist, Eirenaeus Philalethes, who encapsulated a very fundamental idea of Alchemy wit h these words in his book, The Metamorphosis of Metals, \"All metallic seed is the seed of gold, for gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals. . .all metals are p otentially gold.\" At this point we have made a case that all things, consist of three essentials, Sulphur, Salt and Mercury. This Trinity is also found in religion , mythology and symbolism. We have the physical properties of solids, liquids and gases, F ather, Son and Holy Ghost, the three Graces, the three Furies, the three Fates, Fire, Wa ter and Earth, Osiris, Horus and Isis, Brahma, Shiva, Vishnu, the Law of the Triangle, pro tons, neutrons and electrons, and so forth. Some of these analogies are a little less th an direct, but the general idea underlying them holds true. But how can this be used in our da ily lives? What good can come from this? What are the practicalities? To fully answer these questions would require a book, but we can give at least one set of ideas on how Alchemy c an enrich our lives. Moreover, we can get some inkling as to how it will affect not only our physical well-being, but exert a parallel salutary effect on our `spiritual lives.'"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 57 First, we must state that Alchemy as a discipline, has as its foundations, certain other d isci pli nes .

We will give some ideas of how the fundamentals of Magic, Q abalah and Astrology play a vital role in Alchemical work. But before that, let us briefly consider one of the ancient writers on Alchemy, Gerhard Dorn. Dorn was a disciple of the g reat Paracelsus and wrote some very c o gent o bse r va tio ns on Alc he my. It h as to b e r ec o gn ise d t hat Dor n d id no t h a ve t he psychological insights we have today, nor even the extensive vocabulary to f ully express his i dea s.

The gist of it is that the very process of DOING something, actual laboratory wo r k, me di tati on o n Alc he my o r e ve n the in no cu ou s a cti vit y of re adi n g a lch e mic al lit erat ur e, ca us es so me t hin g t o ha pp en i n t he p rac t itio ne r.

He is ma ki n g so me s ort of tr an smu t ati o n ta ke plac e i n h is ret ort or pan s. Actually, Dorn is saying that T WO transmutations ar e taking place. One that is visible, in the retort, and one not visible, in the practitione r. Moreover, that as the work continues, t his tr an s mut atio n a ccele rat es s uc h tha t th ere is a fe ed bac k lo op ge ne rate d. T hat i s, t he more one does the work, of any kind, the greater wi ll be the success. This may sound like a simple case of practice makes perfect. T his is not what Dorn means. What he is saying is b est s ho wn b y a n ex a mp le . Consider two people. One, a chap who has been doing some kind of alchemical activity, r ead in g or si mp le e xpe ri me nts of so me s ort . T he oth er ma n has no t do ne a n yt hi n g i n Alchemy whatsoever. The first man then decides to t ry a different experiment. He wants to take a substance A and add it to a substance B to m ake substance C. He pours A into B and behold. He has C. Not all that impressive except, t he second man comes along and, using the same substances, the same equipment, he fails t o come up with C. Why? Because, the i nn er tra ns mu tati on h as not b ee n goi n g on in hi m a s i t has i n the fir st per so n. A su btl e change has occurred in the first person that allows his experiment to be a success. This change is VERY subtle, possibly not even discernibl e to the individual. But it takes place nonetheless, and to the degree that the practitione r has conditioned or prepared himself. If he has been making elixirs to purge his physical be ing of dross in order to be more receptive t o hi gher vibr atio ns , the c ha n ges wi ll be pr opo rtio nat el y mo re pr on ou nc ed ."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 58 Further, von Franz also cites the Arab alchemist, I bn Sina, who wrote that through ECST ACY, man could acquire some of the capacity of God. That is, through such practices as meditation, alchemy, ritual, etc, one can achieve a state of mind Ibn Sina calls \"ecstacy.\" In this state one can, even for a brief moment, have powers analagous to those of God. Sufis also obtained this state through physica l practices such as dancing or whirling, (i.e. the `whirling dervishes'). T oday, we know tha t this exalted state, wherein things `happen' can be achieved through techniques such as Magic as exemplified by Qabalah. Dom Pernety's book, The Great Art, contains a reference to indicate that the ancient Rosicrucians blended Alchemy and Qabalah into a coh esive system. Further, their mysticism was based on truths that they were able t o demonstrate in the laboratory. We can see some strong evidence then, that there IS a connection between Magic, Qabalah and Astrology It was stated that in Alchemy one can make various medicaments; that these elixirs have a salutary effect both physically and spiritually. The base matters used for such medicines can be plants or herbs or various metals. But where does one start? What herb, for example, can one use for some specific ailment? Or what meta l? Our answers come from a knowledge of Qabalah-Magic, specifically knowledge of that mi ghty glyph known as the Tree of Life, and from the laws of Astrology. For example, Astrol ogy tells us that those people born under the same `sign' will exhibit the same charact eristics. That is, an individual born in early April is under the sign of Aries. Others born under this sign will tend to have similar traits, such as being dynamic, head-strong, jumping from one interest to another without finishing the first, etc. Aries is a zodiacal `pict ure' that has in it the planet Mars. This picture composed of stars, sends rays or influences to the earth. The sun acts as a step-down transformer and absorbs some of these rays, dispers ing the rest to earth. It is these stellar influences that `imprint' a person at the mome nt of birth, and what other positions were maintained by the other planets, these are the infl uences which make him who he (or she) is. By careful study of these planetary configurations, one can determine why they are who they are. What is perhaps new to the reader is the idea that not only are there Arian and Libran people, there are also Arian and Libran plants and minerals. The other kingdoms also come under the dominion of the astral influences. And th is is where the key to making medicines alchemically comes in. For instance, we know that t he planet Mercury `rules' the nervous system. We can determine that Mercury also rules th e herbs valerian and marjoram. Further, the planet Mercury rules over the conditio n known as insomnia. So then, if we had a nervous condition or had insomnia, what herb woul d possibly make a good medicine for these problems? Valerian or marj oram, because they are `correspondences' in that they have the same ruler. We can take this a step furthe r, the planet Mercury rules over Wednesday. It is a simple matter to reach the concl usion that the best day to pick valerian would be on a. . .Wednesday. By the same token, the best time to make a medicine, or to take that medicine would also be a Wednesday. An ad ditional refinement is that the day is divided into several parts. Each part, both the day and the night, have periods of time when"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"VOLUME TWO 59 the influence of one planet is stronger than any ot her. That is to say, twice during Thursday, the influence of Mars is stronger than at any other time. Thus, one might find out what this time period is and not only make and take the medic ine on the `correct' day, but do it during the `correct' times. In the mineral kingdom, the same sort of logic prev ails. If we had a problem with the head or with hemorrhaging, we could use an herb suc h as garlic, anise or cayenne. A tincture could be made of one of these herbs or, if the practitioner had the knowledge, he could exalt the herb to its highest level and confe ct what is known in alchemy as a `plant stone.' T his is the highest level of efficacy any h erb potent in medicine could have. It requires man to bring the plant to this advanced st ate of evolution. On the other hand, a medicine could also be found in the mineral kingdom , in iron. Mars rules iron just as it rules the head and garlic, etc. But how can one make medi cine from iron? This is where practical laboratory Alchemy comes in. It would require an as tute reader of alchemical literature to arrive at the proper procedure, or more aptly, one could learn from a teacher of Alchemy. The process is, to separate the iron (ore) into its three essentials. Just as was done for the plant. To make the herbal medicine, one had to make a tincture of the herb which would extract the sulphur principle. The sulphur would 't inet' or colour the extraction media or `menstruum' as it is called. This colouring is caus ed by the Sulphur which the menstruum has leached out of the herb. T he sulphur could more readily be obtained by a steam distillation as well. The mercury of the plant is i n the alcohol. One could putrify the plant and generate alcohol or one could distill alcohol f rom wine (if this is legal in the reader's area) or purchase grain alcohol; the mercury being uniform in all types of alcohol obtained from vegetable matter. Finally, the body of the her b will be burned or calcined to obtain the Salt. By the same principle, and by following the s ame procedure, one could separate any body, including mineral, into its three essentials. Therefore, one could take iron ore, or some other f orm of iron, and make a tincture using a suitable menstruum. The tincture would be driven off (i.e. evaporated) and the sulphur would be left behind. The oil of iron, then, would in itself be a potent medicine. It would be more potent than that derived from a plant. The rea son being that the minerals have `been around' much longer than any plant and thus have ab osorbed greater astral influences and thus are more potent. They have a higher level of v ibration. In any event, the soul of the iron, once it has been separated, must also be puri fied. All these processes involve heat. The mastery of the heat is a technique learned from a t eacher, or by (often painful) trial and error. Once purified, it can be taken as is or it c an be combined with the mercury of the mineral kingdom which is called `alkahest.' The mer cury of the mineral kingdom is not so easily come by; but with it one can make the fabled `Philosopher's Stone.' This stone can cure all illnesses and cause instant upward evoluti ons or transmutations. Does this sound as if it could change a base matter into a noble on e? Yes, it can. To return to just the sulphur or oil of iron, consi der what you have, once you know how to make it. Not only is it a medicine for the head, but it is a medicine for all other ailments"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 60 governed by Mars. T o find out just what Mars, and a ll other planets, govern, one could check with such reference works as The Alchemist's Handbook, or Bill's Rulership Book, etc. Consider just one aspect: anaemia. People with poor blood or \"tired blood\" take products such as Geritol. This fine product is deri ved from iron, sure enough. However, it is made from something like iron oxide, a non-organic matter. Or, we can absorb some non- organic material, as the built-in, inner alchemist we all have, can effect such transmutations. In this case it is a `biological tr ansmutation.' T he tolerance here is about 3% of what the body has taken in of non-organic mat erial. Would it not be marvelous if we could find a substance that is non-toxic, can be ab sorbed 100% by the body, AND has no side effects like some products do. Did you think o f oil of iron? Correct. T his substance CAN be totally utilised by the body and NOT have si de effects that are unwanted. More germane, it overcomes the anaemic condition. The us es of minerals in Alchemy, just in the field of medication, are endless. Basil Valentine w rote an entire book on one mineral alone, its various uses in medicine. This book is called t he Triumphal Chariot of Antimony. It is a `recipe' book, explaining the various preparations of that metal known as antimony. Antimony is poisonous? Yes, but when it is prepared by alchemical processes, `spagyrically,' it is not only rendered non-toxic, but it could be a panacea. T o give the reader a flavour of this incredible boo k by Valentine and to perhaps \"turn them on\" to Alchemy, the following is quote of a pr ocess by Valentine using antimony. This was extracted from Triumphal Chariot of Antimony published by Dorman Newman in 1678 in England, and was translated by Dr. T heo Kir kringius: \"T he dose of it before coagulation is eight grains taken in wine. It makes a man very young again, delivers him from all melancholy and w hatsoever in the body of man grows and increaseth, as the hairs and nails fall off and the whole man is renewed as a Phoenix (if such a feigned bird, which is only here for example 's sake named by me, can anywhere be found on this earth) is renewed by fire. And this m edicine can no more be burned by the Fire, than the feathers of that unknown salamander; for it consumes all symptoms in the body, like consuming fire, to which it is deservedl y likened; it drives away every evil and expels all that which Aurum-Potabile is capable to expel\". Does not that description sound like something you would like to see happen? It could, you know. Valentine reveals in his book various tec hniques on how to be \"successful\" in alchemical work. He spoke from the viewpoint of one who KNEW, not one who guessed or who thought it might be this way. And Valentine was n't the only good writer of alchemical treatises. T he writings of Paracelsus, Geber, Glaub er, Vaughn, Sendivogius, and Flamel are amongst those of the older writers that are par ticularly noteworthy. But there are even modern day writers such as Frater Albertus, Phillip Hurley and Archibald Cockren. In Cockren's book, Alchemy Re-discoverd and Restored he describes various alchemists and their writings. He was particularly impressed with Johannes Isaaci Hollander, who, he said, wrote so clearly and plainly, his writings ha ve been totally discounted. Ah, none are so blind as they who will not see.

This He, (10) this She, this IT, is in al l things, but hath wings which thou canst not constrain. For when thou sayest ‘He is here’ he is not here, for by that time he is already away, for he is Eternal Motion and Vibration.” Nevertheless in Mercury must thou seek all things. Therefore not without reason did our Ancient Fratres say that the Great Work was to “Fix the Volatile.” There is but one place where he can be fixed, and that is the Centre, a centre e xact. “Centrum in trigono centri.” (11) The Centre in the triangle of the Centre.

FRATER N.O.M. As confusion is found to exist with regard to the R ight and Left Pillars of the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life in relation to the right and left side s of a man, and as to the phases of the Moon—you mu st note: That in every diagram and picture, the right hand s ide of the observer is next to the Pillar of Mercy—Chokmah, Chesed, and Netzach; while the Pilla r of Severity is on the observer’s left hand. Yet when you apply the Tree of Life to yourself, your r ight side, arm, and leg represent the side of Stren gth and Severity, Binah, Geburah and Hod, and your left side refers to the Pillar of Mercy. So that when y ou look at a diagram, you are looking, as it were, at a man facing you, that your right side faces his le ft. His Merciful side forms the right hand Pillar in front of you, so that it is as if you looked at yourself in a mirror. Just as the man looks at you, so does the Moon look at you and so you say that the Moon in her increase is on the side of Mercy, the right hand pi llar of the Sephiroth; and in her decrease, the cre scent is on the left hand Pillar of Severity.

The Pillars II In the explanation of the Symbols of the Grade of N eophyte, your attention has been directed to the general mystical meaning of the Two pillars cal led in the Ritual the \"Pillars of Hermes\" of \"Seth\" and of \"Solomon.\" In the 9th chapter of the Ritual f t he Dead they are referred to as the \"Pillars of Shu ,\" the \"Pillars of the Gods of Dawning Light,\" and also as \"the North and Southern Columns of the Gate of the Hall of Truth.\" In the 125th Chapter, they are rep resented by the sacred gateway, the door to which t he aspirant is brought when he has completed the negat ive confession. The archaic pictures on the one Pi llar are painted in black upon a white ground, and those on the other in white upon a black ground, in orde r to express the interchange and reconciliation of oppos ing forces and the eternal balance of light and darkness which gives force to visible nature. The black cubical bases represent darkness and matt er wherein the spirit, the Ruach Elohim, began to formulate the Ineffable NAME, that Name wh ich the ancient Rabbis have said \"rushes through the universe,\" that Name before which the Darkness rolls back the birth of time. The flaming red triangular capitals which crown the summit of the Pillars represent the Triune manifestation of the Spirit of Life, the Three Moth ers of the Sepher Yetsirah, the Three Alchemical Principles of Nature, the Sulphur, the Mercury and the Salt. Each Pillar is surmounted by its own light-bearer v eiled from the material world. At the base of both Pillars rise the Lotus flowers, symbols of regeneration and metempsychosis. The archaic illustrations are taken from the vignet tes of teh 17th and 125th chapter of the Ritual of the Dead the Egyptian Book of the Per-em-Hru or the Boo k of Coming Forth into the Day, the oldest book in the world as yet discovered. The Recension of the Priests of ON is to be found in the walls of the Pyramids of the Kings of the 5th and 6th Dynasties at Sakarah, the recensions of the 11th and 12th Dynasties on the sarcophagi of thatperiod, and the Theban recension of the 18th Dynasty and onward is found on papyri, both plain and illuminated. No sa tisfactory translation of these books is avalable, none having been yet attempted by a scholar having the q ualifications of mystic as well as Egyptologist. The Ritual of the Dead, generally speaking, is a co llection of hymns and prayers in the form of a series of ceremonial Rituals to enable the man to u nite himself with Osiris the Redeemer. After this union he is no longer called the man, but Osiris with who m he is now symbolically identified. \"That they al so may be One of us,\" said the Christ of the New Testa ment. \"I am Osiris\" said the purified and justifie d man, his soul luminous and washed from"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"VOLUME THREE 3 sin in the immortal and uncreated light, united to Osiris, and thereby justified, and the son of God; purified by suffering, strengthened by opposition, regenerate through self-sacrifice. Such is the sub ject of the great Egyptian Ritual. The 17th Chapter of the Theban recension consists o f a very ancient text with several commentaries, also extremely old, and some prayers, none of which come into the scheme of the orginal text. It has, together with the 12th chapter, been very carefully translated for the purpose of this lecture by the V.H. Frater M.W.T, and the V.H. Soror S.S.D. D. has made many valuable suggestions with regard to the interpretation. The Title and Preface of th e 17th Chapter reads: \"Concerning the exaltation of the Glorified Ones, o f Coming and Going forth in the Divine Domain, of the Genies of the Beautiful land of Amen tet. Of coming forth in the light o fDay in any fo rm desired, of Hearing the Forces of Nature by being e nshrined as a living Bai.\" And the rubric is: \"The united with Osiris shall recite it when he has entered the Harbour. May glorious things be done thereby upon earth. May all the words of the Adept be fulfilled.\" Owing to the complex use of symbols, the ritual tra nslation of the Chapter can only be understood by perpetual reference to the ancient Egyptian comm entaries, and therefore the following paraphrase ha s been put together to convey to modern minds as near ly as possible the ideas conceived by the old Egyptians in this glorious triumphal song of the So ul of Man made one with Osiris, the Redeemer. \"I am TUM made One with all things. \"I have become NU. I am RA in his rising ruling by right of his power I am the Great God self-begott en, even NU, who pronounced His Names, and thus the Cir cle of Gods was created. \"I am Yesterday and know Tomorrow.

Enthroned in the Domain of Horus where the Spirit and Body are united in the presence of the Ancient of Days. Blotted out are the sins of his body in passion. He has passed the Eternal Gate, and has r eceived the New Year Feast with Incense, at the marriage of Earth with Heaven. \"TUM has built his Bridal Chamber. RURURET has fou nded his shrine.

Thy Power is exceeding great. The Gods curse him that curseth Thee. Thine Aspirations are fulfilled. Th ou art Mistress of Splendour. They are destroyed who barred the way. The 125th Chapter is concerned wit h the entry of an Initiate into the Hall of the Two C olumns of Justice, and commenced with a most beauti ful and symbolic description of Death, as a journey fro m the barren wilderness of Earth, to the Glorious L and which lies beyond. The literal translation of the opening lines is as follows: \"I have come from afar to look upon thy beauties. My hands salute Thy Name of Justice. I have come from afar, where the Acacia Tree grew not. Wh ere the tree thick with leaves is not born. Where there com not beams from herb or grass. I have ent ered the Place of Mystery.

The Princes of the Gates in their Glory . The illustrations in this chapter represent the Hal l of Truth as seen through the open leaves of its door. The Hall is presided over by a God who holds his right hand over the cage of a hawk, and his le ft over the food of eternity. On each side of the God is a cornice crowned by a row of alternate feather s and Uraei symbolizing justice and firey power. The doo r leaf which completes the right hand of a stall is called \"Posessor of Truth controlling the Feet,\" wh ile that on the left is \"Possessor of strength, bin ding the male and female animals.\" The 42 Judges of the Dead are represented as seated in a long row, and each of them has to be named, and the Sin over which he presided has been denied. This chapter describes the"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"VOLUME THREE 5 introduction of the initiate into the Hall of Truth by Anubis, who, having questioned the aspirant, re ceives from him an account of his initiation, and is satis fied by his right to enter. He States that he has been taken into the ante-chamber of the Temple and there stripped and blind-folded, he had to grope for the entrance of the Hall, and having found it he was re clothed and anointed in the presence of the Initiat ed. He is then asked for the Pass-words and demands tha t his Soul should be weighed in the Great Balance o f the Hall of Truth, whereupon ANUBIS again interroga tes him concerning the symbolism of the door of the Hall, and his answers being found correct, ANUB IS says: \"Pass on, thou knowest it.\" Among other things the initiate states that he has been purified four times, the same number of times that the Neophyte is purified and consecrated in the cer emony of the Neophyte. He then makes the long Negative Confession, stating to each Judge in turn that he is innocent of that form of Sin over which he judges. Then he invokes the Judges to do him justi ce, and afterwards describes how he had washed in t he washing place of the South, and rested in the North , in the place called \"Son of the Deliverers\" and h e becomes the Dweller under the Olive Tree of Peace, and how how he was given a tall flame of fire and a sceptre of cloud, and made a lake of it. The initi ate is then brought to the actual Pillars, and has to name them and their parts under the symbol of the Scales of Balance. He also has to name the Guardian of t he Gateway who prevents his passage, and when all thes e are propitiated, the plea of the Hall itself crie s out against his steps, saying \"Because I am silent, bec ause I am pure,\" and it must know that his aspirati ons are pure enough hand high enough for him to be allo wed to tread upon it. He is then allowed to announ ce to Thoth that he is clean from all evil, and has ov ercome the influence of the planets, and THOTH says to him: \"Who is He whose Pylons are of Flame, whose walls o f Living Uraei, and the flames of whose House are streams of Water?\" and the Initiate repli es \"Osiris!\" And it is immediately proclaimed: \"The meat shall b e from the Infinite, and thy drink from the Infinit e. Thou art able to go forth to the sepulchral feasts on earth, for thou has overcome.\" Thus, these two chapters, which are represented by their illustrations upon the Pillars, represent the advance and purification of the Soul and its union with Osiris, the Redeemer, in the Golden Dawn of th e Infinite Light, in which the Soul is transfigured, knows all, and can do all, for it is made One with the Eternal God.

This was inadvertently called by Lepsi us the XVIth chapter. It is not, however, a chapter at all, but ornaments or illustrations (cal led Vignettes) intended to accompany the Hymn to the Rising Sun. The vignettes are slightly different in different papyri; those in the Papyrus of Ani are the best on the whole; those on the pillars are selected from several examples. The designs may be explained as follows: The first figure does not occur in the Papyrus of Ani, and varies in others. It is various ly explained. Probably it is meant for an ideograph of the Hymn . T he soul, figured by a bird, beholding the Truth (a feather). The two figures following are said by some Egyptologist s to be the deceased and his wife playing drafts under a canopy. It is more probable however that his initiator or guide teaching him the ways of the kingdom of souls, by means of a gam e. He is moving a piece, he wears the Lotus headdress, and she has the crown of Nephthys. Following this are the souls of the deceased and his guide as two human-headed hawks on a pylon-shaped building.

It is written ‘So the Name JEHOVAH is joined to the Name ELOHIM, for JEHOVAH planted a Garden Eastward in Eden.’ From the Three Supernals follow the other Sephiroth of THE TREE OF UFE. Below the TREE, proceeding from MALKUTH is THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE of GOOD AND of EVIL which is between the Tree of Life and the World or Assiah or Shells, represented by the Coiled Up DRAGON with Seven Heads and Ten Horns—being the Seven Infernal Palaces and the Ten Averse Sephiroth.

GIHON: Water—the Waters of Mercy, flowing into CHES ED. HIDDIKEL: Air—flowing into TIPHARETH. PHRATH (Euphrates): Earth — flowing into MALKUTH. It is written “In DAATH the Depths are broken up an d the Clouds drop down dew.” The word Naher has the meaning ‘perennial stream’—’never failing w aters’ as opposed to other words meaning Torrent or Brook.

Then the Sephirotic Tree was shattered. She fell an d with her fell the Great ADAM. And the Great Red Dragon arose with his seven heads and ten horns, and EDEN was desolated—and the folds of the Dragon enclosed MALKUTH and linked it to the Ki ngdom of the Shells. And the heads of the Dragon rose into the seven low er Sephiroth, even up to DAATH at the feet of Alma Elohim. Thus were the four Rivers of EDEN desecrated and th e Dragon Mouth gave forth the Infernal Waters in DAATH—and this is LEVIATHAN, The Piercing and Crooked Serpent.

C onsequently, the realisation of sorrow as it impinges on the personality and an und erstanding of its causes must inevitably constitute the first impetus to perform the Great W ork, even as it comprises the motive first to seek the services of the analytical psychologist. T his impetus and this self-consciousness are the prime implications of Daath. Its significat ion is a higher type of consciousness, the beginning of a spiritual rebirth. It acts as a self -evolved link between the higher Self on the one hand at peace in its Supernal Eden, and the hum an soul on the other, bound by its fall to the world of illusion and sense and matter. But until that self-consciousness and acquired knowledge are turned to noble and altruistic ends, sorrow and suffering are the inevitable results. Continually will the Red Dragon, the inver ted power of the eros, ravish the little kingdom of self until such time as we lift ourselve s up to the diviner parts of our human nature, thus conquering the foe by driving it back to its proper realm, using but neither ignoring nor repre:,sing experience and its fruits to transcend our own personal limitations.

Neither worship nor neglect the physical body, whic h is thy temporary connection with the outer and material world. Therefore let thy mental equili brium be above disturbances by material events. Restrain the animal passions and nourish the higher aspirations; the emotions are purified by sufferin g. Do good unto others for God’s sake, not for reward, not for gratitude from them, not for sympathy. If thou art generous, thou wilt not long for thine ears to be tickled by expressions of grat itude; Remember that unbalanced force is evil, that unbala nced severity is but cruelty and oppression, but th at also unbalanced Mercy is but weakness which would a llow and abet evil. True prayer is as much action as Word; it is Will. The Gods will not do for man what his Higher Powers can do for himself, if he cultivate Will and Wisdom. Remember that this Earth is but an atom in the Universe, and thou thyself but an atom thereon. And that even couldst thou become the God of this"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 20 Earth whereon thou crawlest and grovellest, thou wo uldst even then be but an atom and one among many. Nevertheless, have the greatest self-respect, and t o that end sin not against thyself. The sin which i s unpardonable is knowingly and wilfully to reject sp iritual truth, but every sin and act leaveth its ef fect. To obtain magical Power, learn to control thought. Admit only true ideas which are in harmony with the end desired, and not every stray and contr adictory idea that presents itself. Fixed thought i s a means to an end; therefore pay attention to the pow er of silent thought and meditation. The material a ct is but the outward expression of the thought, and ther efore it bath been said that “the thought of foolis hness is sin.” Thought therefore is the commencement of a ction, and if a chance thought can produce much effect, what cannot fixed thought do? Therefore, as has been already said, establish thyself firmly in the Equilibrium of Forces, in the centre of the cross o f the elements, that Cross from whose centre the creative word issued in the birth of the dawning un iverse. As it was said unto thee in the Grade of Theoricus: “Be thou therefore prompt and active as the Sylphs, but avoid frivolity and caprice. Be energet ic and strong like the Salamanders, but avoid irrit ability and ferocity. Be flexible and attentive to images l ike the Undines, but avoid idleness and changeabili ty. Be laborious and patient like the Gnomes, but avoid grossness and avarice.” So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy Soul and fit thyself to c ommand the spirits of the elements. For wert thou to summon the Gnomes to pander to thy avarice, thou wouldst no longer command them, but they would command thee. Wouldst thou abu se the pure creatures of God’s creation to fill thy coffers and to satisfy thy lust for Gold? Wouldst t hou defile the"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"VOLUME THREE 21 Spirits of driving Fire to serve thy wrath and hatr ed? Wouldst thou violate the purity of the Souls of the Water to pander to thy lust and debauchery? Wouldst thou force the Spirits of the evening breez e to minister to thy folly and caprice? Know that with such desires thou canst but attract the evil and not the good, and in that can the evil will have power over thee. In true religion there is no sect. Therefore take h eed that thou blaspheme not the name by which another knoweth his God for if thou doest this thin g in Jupiter, thou wilt blaspheme YHVH; and in Osir is YEHESHUAH. “Ask of God and ye shall have Seek and ye shall fin d. Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” SHEM HA-MEPHORESCH THE 72 FOLD NAME This refers to the Seventy Two Names of the Expound ed Name YHVH.. Four is the number of the letters of the Tetragramm aton. Four is also the number of the letters of the name ADNI which is its representative and key. The latter name is bound with the former and united thereto, thus IAHDVNHY forming a name of 8 letters. 8 X 3, the number of the Supernal Triad, yields the 24 thrones of the Elders of the Apocalypse, eac h of whom wears on his head a golden crown of three rays, each ray of which is a name, each name an Abs olute Idea and Ruling Power of the great name YHVH Tetragrammaton. The number 24 of the thrones multiplied by the 3 ra ys of the crown which equals 72, the name of God of 72 letters, which is thus mystically shown i n the name YHVH, as under: (Or as the book of Revelation says: “When the living creatures (the fo ur Kerubim the Letters of the Name) give glory to Him, etc. the four and twenty elders fall down befo re Him and cast"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 22 their crowns before the Throne, etc.” (that is the Crowns, which each bear 3 of the 72 Names, and these 72 names are written on the leaves of the Tre e of Life which were for the healing of the nations .) These are also the 72 names of the ladder of Jacob on which the Angels of God ascended and descended. It will presently be shown how the 72 An gelic names are formed from the 72 Names of the Deity, and also how their signification is to be fo und. The 72 Names of the Deity are thus obtained. T he 19th, 20th, and 21st verses of the XIV Chapter of t he Book of Exodus each consist of 72 letters. (The English translation is:) 19th verse: “And the Angel of the Elohim, that went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pi llar of cloud removed from before them and stood behind them.” 20th verse: “And it came between the camp of the Eg yptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness (to the first) but it gave light by night (to these); and the one came not near unt o the other all the night.” 21st verse: “And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the Lord drove back the sea with a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land, and the waters divided.” These three verses are now to be written at length one above the other, the first from right to left, and the second from left to right, and the third fr om right to left; and as they contain 72 letters, t here will be 72 columns of three letters each. Then each colu mn will give a word of three letters, and there wil l be 72 names of three letters each, which are the Shem ha Mephoresch or 72 Names of the Deity, expounding the Powers of the name YHVH. From these names 72 Names of Angels are formed by t he addition of, in some cases, the suffice YH which signifies Mercy and Beneficence, or in oth ers of the suffice AL which signifies Severity and Judgment. Or as it is said: “And the Name is in Him , etc.” These 72 Angels rule over the 72 Quinances or sets of 50 of the Zodiac, and therefore each decanate or set of 100 of a Sign has 2 Quinances, a nd each sign has 3 decanates, which are again allot ted to the Planets in regular order. This is the format ion as given above (each Angel’s name containing 5 letters and each name of Deity 3.). These then are the Schem ha-Mephoresch or 72 Angels bearing the Name of God, classed into nine sets of 8, each answering to the nine choirs o f Angels, and also divided into 4 great divisions o f 18 each, each division under the Presidency of one of the four letters of the Name YHVH. They are further classed as belonging to the decana tes of the Zodiac as follows: 2 Quinances to each decanate. The first division of 3 Signs is und er the Presidency of Y, the letter of Fire. The sec ond Division of 3 signs, headed by the Watery sign Canc er, is under the Presidency of H the Letter of Wate r. The third division of 3 Signs headed by the Airy Si gn Libra is under the Presidency of VAU, the letter of Air. And the 4th division of 3 signs headed by the Earthy Sign Capricorn is under the Presidency of HE H final, the letter of Earth. But it should be remembered that the most powerful rule of Y of Tetragrammaton is over the Fiery Triplicity; that of H over the Watery Triplic ity; that of Vau over the Airy"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"VOLUME THREE 23 Triplicity; and that of H final over the Earthy Tri plicity. In the 22nd chapter of the Apocalypse of St. John i t is said that “The Tree of Life which bare Twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month, and the leaves of the Tree were for the hea ling of the Nations. And there shall be no more curse; b ut the Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it.”This is exemplified in the drawing taken from t he 3-8 Altar Diagram. The “TwelveManner of fruits yielded every month” answer to the signs of the Zod iac and the Twelve Tribes of the Sons of Jacob. Als o to the twelve apostles. The healing leaves are thos e of Schem ha-Mephoresch or the divided Name of Zauir Anpin, the Microprosopus, the Christ, the Lam b of Elohim, whose Throne is in the Tree, from which Throne issues the River of the Waters of Life . The Seventy two leaves of the Tree of Life are Zaui r Anpin or Microprosopus. Now the Twelve Sons of Jacob go down into Egypt, that is the Kingd om, Malkuth, which has been destroyed in the Fall, and cut from the Sephirotic Tree by the intersectin g folds of the great Dragon who then becomes its Ru ler as shown in the great Altar Diagram of the 4-7 grad e. “Behold, I am against thee, Pharoah, King of Egy pt, the great dragon thai lieth in the midst of the Riv ers.” And the first of the sons of Jacob who goeth down is Joseph whose two Tribes, Ephraim and Manasseh, b alance each other in Chesed and Geburah. That is to say, that there first comes down into the desola ted Earth the combined power of Mercy and Severity. And Ephraim, the Kerubic sign of the Ox, is the nat ural ruler of Earth in Malkuth, under the power of H final of the Holy Name, the Bride, Eve, and the Que en. And the Schem ha-Mephoresch, the 72, are found in the number of the family of Jacob’s sons is 70; and Jacob and Joseph equals 72. But the then ruling Pharoah, corresponds more to Hadar amongst the Edom ite Kings, as representing one of not so evil a tendency. Yet as the Apocalyptic symbol of the Lamb and the Airy Sign which leads off the Schem ha- Mephoresch is Chesed; one opposed to the evil symbo l of the Dragon, so is every shepherd an abomination to the Egyptians, who yet are friendly with the Ox symbol, the Kerubic Ruler of Earth, and therefore is it symbolically said by the Children o f Israel that their business has been about cattle and not about sheep."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 24 But the name YHVH, the Son, the Microprosopus is no t therein established till the Ten Sephiroth have sent forth their Judgment up on the land of Egypt, i.e., the Ten Plagues. And therefore it is only when YHVH interpo ses between Egypt and Israel that the verses occur in Exodus which show forth the Sch em ha-Mephoresch. There are also other ways of making sets of 72 names out of t hese verses, Exodus xiv, v. 19, 20 and 21, e.g. by writing them all from right to left , and so on, and also by permutation of the letters by any rule of Temurah. The meanings of these are then to be found as herein after shown for the regular Schem ha-Mephore sch. It is worthy of note that all the letters of the Al phabet except Gimel are employed in the Schem ha-M ephoresch. This letter G imel whose numerical value is 3, is therefore the key of their construction, they being grouped together in words of three letters each. Furthermore, there are 360° in the Zodiac, and this divided by 5 gives 72 0 which is the interval between the points of a regu lar pentagram inscribed within a great circle. Also the number 72 equals 6 x 12 which equals 72 cubes or Hexagrams, so that each Hexagram will represent by its Angles the 6 Quinancies of a Sign, the Sign itself being written in the centre, e.g. in any order that may be required. The meaning of these 72 names of God, of the Angels of the Schem ha- Mephoresch are then collected in the following mann er from those 72 verses taken from different Psalms, in each of which the name YH VH appears, save in the case of the 70th, YBM: Here follow in detail the Psalms mentioned, showing the method of extracting the angelic Names.

Let the Tetragrammaton, as in this diagram, be writ ten a triangle apex upwards, so that its component letters form a trian gle in themselves by increasing each descending line beyond the space occupied by t he line above it.

HODOS CHAMELIONIS CONCERNING THE TREE OF LIFE This is the Book of the Path of the Chameleon - the knowledge of the colours of the forces which lie beyond the physical universe. Study thou well t hat saying of Hermes ‘that which is below is like t hat which is above,’ for if that which is below is conf ormed according to the Law of the Concealed One Gre at is his Name - be thou well assured that the closer thou adherest unto the Law of the Universe in thy working, by so much the more is thy Magical working just and true. Recall what was said unto thee in the Ritual of the Paths of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepti. ‘Therefore, by the straight and narrow path of Same kh, let the Philosophus advance like the arrow from the Bow of Qesheth. Now Qesheth the Bow is the Rain bow of Promise stretched above the earth, whose name is formed from the letters of the Paths leadin g from Malkuth. If then it be by the Path of Samekh that the Philosophus should advance to the knowledg e of the Adept, turning aside neither unto the righ t hand nor unto the left, whereon are the evil and th reatening symbols of Death and the Devil, he must h ave a perfect and absolute knowledge of the Bow, ere he can follow the Path of the Arrow. But the Bow is o f brilliant and perfect colour, whose analysis and sy nthesis yield others of the same scale, and hence i s this book entitled “The Book of the Path of the Chameleo n” - that Path, namely which ascendeth alone through the force of Qesheth, the Bow. And if thy knowledge and application of the outer k nowledge, which thou hast already learned, be faulty and incorrect how wilt thou be able to ke ep thyself from turning aside unto thy hurt? Theref ore, learn not knowledge by rate only as an unreasoning child, but meditate, search out and compare, and to the end, see that thou think but little of thyself for only he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

THE MICROCOSM - MAN Thou shalt know that the whole Sphere of Sensation which surroundeth the whole physical body of a man is called “The Magical Mirror of the Unive rse.” For therein are represented all the occult fo rces of the Universe projected as on a sphere, convex to the outer, but concave to man. This sphere surroundeth the physical body of a man as the Celes tial Heavens do the body of a Star or a Planet, hav ing their forces mirrored in its atmosphere. Therefore its allotment or organization is the copy of that G reater World or Macrocosm. In this “Magical Mirror of the Universe,” therefore, are the Ten Sephiroth projected in the form of the Tree of Life as in a s olid sphere. (See the diagram in the colour section on the Tree of Life in a solid sphere.) A man’s physical b ody is within the Ten Sephiroth projected in a sphe re. The divisions and parts of the body are formed from the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life, thus: KETHER Kether is above the Crown of the Head, and represen ts a crown which indeed is powerful, but requires one worthy to wear it. In the crown of the head is placed the faculty of Neschamah, which is the power of Aspiration unto that which is beyond. This power Neschamah is especially attributed unto the Supernal Triad in Assiah, of which there are three manifestations which are included in the general concept, Neschamah. From Chokmah and Binah are form ed the sides of the brain and .head. Therein exist the intellectual faculties of Wisdom and Understand ing, shining into and illuminating their inferior, the Ruach. They are the mansions of the practical admin istration of the intellect,"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"VOLUME THREE 37 whose physical shewing forth is by reflection in Ru ach. In the Magical Mirror of the Universe, or the Sphere of Sensation, Man is placed between four pillars of the Tree of Life as projected in a sphe re. These keep their place and MOVE NOT, but the Man hi mself places in his Sphere of Sensation that point of the Zodiac which ascended at the moment of his b irth and conception (for the same degree of the Zodiac ascendeth at both, otherwise the birth could not take place). That is to say that at those time s the same degree of the Zodiac is ascending in the East of the Heavens of the Star whereon he is incarnated . Thus doth he remain during that incarnation facing that particular point in his sphere of sensation. T hat is to say, this sphere DOTH NOT REVOLVE about the phys ical body. CHESED AND GEBURAH From Chesed and Geburah are formed the arms. Therei n exist the faculties of operative action, wherefore at their extremities are the symbols of t he Four Elements and the Spirit, thus: Thumb - Spirit 3rd Finger - Fire Index Finger - Water Little Finger - Air Second Finger - Earth The arms are the manifestors of the executive power of the Ruach, and therein are the faculties of touch strongly expressed. From TIPHARETH is formed the trunk of the body, fre e from the members, and therein as in a receptacle of influences are situated the vital org ans. The blood is Spirit mingled with and governing the watery principle. The lungs are the receptacles of Air which tempereth the blood as the wind doth the waves of the sea, the mephitic impurities of the bl ood in its traversal of the body requiring the disp ersing force of the Air, even as the sea, under a calm, do th putrify and become mephitic. The heart is the gr eat centre of the action of Fire, lending its terrible energy as an impulse unto the others. Thence cometh from the fiery nature the red colour of the blood. The p art above the heart is the chief abode of the Ruach , as there receiving and concentrating the other express ion of its Sephiroth. This part is the central cita del of the body and is the particular abode of the lower a nd more physical will. The higher will is in the Ke ther of the body. For the higher will to manifest, it mu st be reflected into the lower will be NESCHAMAH. This lower will is potent around the heart and is s eated like the King of the body upon its throne. Th e concentration of the other faculties of the Ruach i n and under the presidency of the Will, at the same time reflecting the administrative governance of CHOKMAH and BINAH, is what is called the human consciousness. That is, a reflection of the two cre ative Sephiroth under the presidency of the Four Elements, or the reflection of Aima and Abba as the parents of the human Jehovah. But the human Neschamah exists only when the higher Will is refle cted"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 38 by the agency of aspiration from Kether into the lo wer body, and when the flaming letter SHIN is placed like a crown on the head of Microprosopus. T hus only doth the human will become the receptacle of the higher Will and the action of Neschamah is t he link therewith. The lower will is the human Jehovah, an angry and jealous God, the Shaker of th e Elements, the manifestor in the life of the body. But illuminated by the higher Will, he becometh YEHESHU AH, no longer angry and jealous, but the self- sacrificer and the Atoning and Reconciling One. This as regards the action of the more physical man . Unto this Ruach also are presented the reflections of the Macrocosmic Universe in the Sphe re of Sensation. They surround the Ruach which, in the natural man, feeleth them but vaguely and compr ehendeth them not. The faculties of the Earth are shown forth in the organs which digest and putrify, casting forth the impurities, even as the Earth is placed above the Qlippoth. Thou wilt say, then, tha t the Ruach cannot be the reasoning mind, seeing th at it reflecteth its reason from Chokmah and Binah, bu t it is the executive faculty which reasoneth, whic h worketh and combineth the faculties reflected into it. The reasoning mind, therefore, is that which us eth and combineth the Principia of Chokmah and Binah so that the parts of Chokmah and Binah which touch the Ruach are the initiators of the reasoning power . The reason itself is a process and but a simulacr um of the action of the higher Wisdom and Understanding. For the Air is not the Light, only the translator o f the Light. Yet without the Air, the operations of the L ight could not so well be carried out. The word Rua ch, Spirit, also meaneth Air. It is like a thing that g oeth out thou knowest not whither, and cometh in th ou knowest not whence. ‘The wind bloweth where it list eth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth. so is e very one that is born of the Spirit.’This Air, the Ruach, permeateth the whole physical body but its concentr ated influence is about the the heart. Yet, were it not for the boundary force of Chokmah and Binah above, of the sphere of sensation surrounding it, and of Malkuth below, the Ruach could not concentrate unde r the presidency of the Name, and the life of the body would cease. Thus far concerning the Ruach as a whole, that is, the action of the Will in Tiphare th. NETZACH AND HOD From Netzach and Hod are formed the thighs and legs , and they terminate in the symbols of five, as do the arms; but they are not so moveable, owing to the effect of Malkuth. In them are placed the faculties of support and firmness and balance; and they show the more physical qualities of the Ruach. In them is the sustaining force of the Ruach. They are the affirmation of the Pillars of the Sephiroth, a s answering to the Passive, the arms more answering t o the two pillars which are Active. They are the columns of the Human Temple. From YESOD are formed the generative and excretory organs, and therein is the seat of the lower desires, as bearing more on the double nature of, o n the one hand, the rejection of"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"VOLUME THREE 39 the Qlippoth, and on the other hand the simulacrum of the vital forces in Tiphareth. It is the special seat of the automatic consciousness. That i s, not the Will, but the simulacrum of the Will in Tiphareth. Yesod is the lowest of the Sephiroth of the Ruach, and representeth “Fundamental Action.” I t therefore governeth generation. In Yesod is therefo re the automatic consciousness or simulacrum of the Will. This automatic consciousness is to the Nephes ch what the Daath action is to the Ruach. Thus, therefore, there being a simulacrum or reflection o f the heart and vital organs in the parts governed by Yesod, if the consciousness of the Tiphareth be giv en unto this wholly, it shall pave the way for dise ase and death. For this will be a withdrawing of the vi tal forces of the Name, which are in the citadel of Tiphareth, to locate them in Yesod, which is a more easily attacked position. For the automatic consciousness is the translator of the Ruach unto t he Nephesch. MALKUTH From Malkuth is formed the whole physical body unde r the command and presidency of Nephesch. The Nephesch is the subtle body of refine d astral Light upon which, as on an invisible patte rn, the physical body is extended. The physical body is permeated throughout by rays of the Ruach, of whic h it is the material completion. The Nephesch shineth through the Material body and formeth the Magical Mirror or Sphere of Sensation. This Magical Mirror or Sphere of Sensation is an imitation or copy of t he Sphere of the Universe. The space between the physi cal body and the boundary of the sphere of Sensatio n is occupied by the ether of the astral world; that is to say, the container or recipient of the Astral Rays of the Macrocosm. The Nephesch is divided into its sev en Palaces, combining the Sephirotic influences in their most material forms. That is, the world of pa ssions dominated by the Ruach, or by the world whic h is beyond. That is, its Sephiroth are passionate, e xpressing a passionate dominion. Thus, its three Supernal Sephiroth, Kether, Chokmah and Binah, are united in a sense of feeling and comprehending impressions. Its Chesed is expressed by laxity of a ction. Its Geburah by violence of action. Its Tipha reth is expressed by more or less sensual contemplation of beauty, and love of vital sensation. Its Hod and Netzach, by physical well-being and health. Its Yes od, by physical desires and gratifications. Its Mal kuth, by absolute increase and domination of matter in th e material body. The Nephesch is the real, the actu al body, of which the material body is only the result through the action of Ruach, which by the aid of t he Nephesch, formeth the material body by the rays of Ruach, which do not ordinarily proceed beyond the limits of the physical body. That is to say, in the ordinary man the rays of Ruach rarely penetrate in to the sphere of Sensation. Shining through infinite world s, and darting its rays through the confines of spa ce, in this Sphere of Sensation is a faculty placed even a s a light is placed in an aperture of the upper par t of the Ruach wherein act the rays from Chokmah and Binah w hich govern the reason, Daath. This faculty can be thrown downwards into the Ruach , and thence can radiate into the Nephesch. It consists of seven manifestations answering to th e Hexagram, and is like the"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 40 Soul of Microprosopus or the Elohim of the Human YH VH. Therefore in the head, which is its natural and chief seat, are formed the seven apertu res of the head. This is the Spiritual consciousnes s as distinct from the Human consciousness. It is manife sted in 7 as just said or in 8 if Daath be included . The Father is the Sun (Chokmah). The Mother is the Moon (Binah). The Wind beareth it in his bosom (Ruach). Its Nurse is the Earth (Nephesch). The pow er is manifested when it can vibrated through the Earth. The following is the true attribution of the seven apertures of the head: The right ear is Saturn. The left ear is Jupiter. The right eye is the Sun. The left eye is the Moon. The mouth is Mercury. The right nostril is Mars. The left nostril is Venus. These latter represent here the sonoriferous sense. The right and left eye the luminous sense, as the Sun and Moon are the luminaries of the Macrocos m. The right and left nostrils through which the breath passes, giving strength to the physical body , are under Mars and Venus. The mouth is under Mercury, the messenger and the Speaker. This spiritual consciousness is a focus of the acti on of Neschamah. The lower will power should control the descent of this spiritual consciousnes into the Ruach, and thence into the Nephesch, for t he consciousness must descend into the Nephesch before the images of the Sphere of Sensation can be perceived. For it is only the rays of this consciou sness permeating the Ruach that can take cognisance thereof. This faculty of the spiritual consciousnes s is the seat of Thought. Thought is a Light procee ding from the radiation of this spiritual consciousness, traversing the Ruach as Light traverseth Air, and encountering thereafter the symbols reflected in th e sphere of Sensation, or magical mirror of the Universe. These symbols are by its radiation (i.e. that of the Thought) reflected again into the Spiri tual Consciousness where they are subjected unto the act ion of the Reasoning Mind and of the Lower Will. That is, in the ordinary natural man when awake, th e thought acteth through the Ruach, subject when there to the action of the Lower Will, and submitte d to the reasoning power derived as aforesaid from Chokmah and Binah. But in the ordinary man when sle eping, and in the madman, the idiot, and the drunkard, the process is not quite the same. In the sleeping man, the concentration of the Ruach in his heart during the waking time hath produced a weakening of the action of the Ruach in its subsidiary Sephiroth in the Physical Body. To preserve the salutary conjunction of the Ruach with the Nephesch in the physical body whose limits are fixed by the Sephiroth of the Ruach it is necessary to weaken the concentration in Tiphareth to repair the strain which is produced by the concentration of th e Ruach therein during the waking state. This reflu x of the Ruach into its subsidiary Sephiroth produceth n aturally a weakening of the Lower Will; and the Ruach, therefore,"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"VOLUME THREE 41 doth not reflect so clearly the Reasoning Faculty. Wherefore, the thought of the spiritual consciousness reflecteth the image in a confused se ries, which are only partially realised by the lowe r will. This is as regards the ordinary natural man i n sleep. In the madman, as considered apart from obsession, thought-obsession is frequently the acco mpaniment of mania, and still more frequently its cause the thought and lower will are very strongly exercised to the detriment of the reasoning faculty . That is, that there is an alliance between the two former which overpowereth the action of Chokmah and Binah in the latter. Monomania is shewn in the cons ideration of only one certain symbol which is too attractive to the Will. A chain of thought is there fore simply a graduated vibration arising from the contact of a ray of thought with a symbol. If controlled by the reasoning power and licensed b y the Will, such vibrations will be balanced and of equal length. But if uncontrolled by the low er Will and the Reason, they will be unbalanced and inharmonious. That is, of uneven length. In the cas e of the drunkard, the equilibrium of the Sphere of Sensation and consequently of the Nephesch, is dist urbed. In consequence the thought rays are shaken a t each vibration, so that the sphere of sensation of the Nephesch is caused to rock and waver at the extremities of the Physical Body where the Ruach ac tion is bounded. The thought therefore is dazzled b y the symbols of the Sphere of Sensation, in the same way as the eyes can be dazzled in front of a mirro r if the latter be shaken or waved. The sensation theref ore then conveyed by the thoughts is that of the Sp here of Sensation oscillating and almost revolving about the physical body, bringing giddiness, sickness, vertigo and the loss of idea of place and position. Nearly the same may be said of Seasickness, and th e action of certain drugs. Restoration of the equilib rium of the Sphere of Sensation after this naturall y produceth a slackening of the concentration of the Ruach in Tiphareth, whence sleep is an absolute necessity to the drunkard. This is so imperative th at he cannot fight against the need. If he does so, or if this condition be constantly repeated, the thought rays are launched through the Sphere of Sensation s o irregularly and so violently that they pass its bou ndary without either the lower Will or the Reasonin g Power or even the Thought itself consenting thereto ; and the latter is therefore without the protectio n of the will. Thence arise the conditions of delirium tremors, an d an opening is made in the Sphere of Sensation which is unguarded, and through which hos tile influences may enter. But this latter cometh under the head of obsession. All thought action in the spiritual consciousness originateth in radiatio n, and radiation is as inseparable from the spiritual cons ciousness as it is from Light. This Spiritual Consciousness is the focus of the action of Nescham ah. The spiritual consciousness is, in its turn, th e Throne or Vehicle of the Life of the Spirit which i s Chiah; and these combined form the Chariot of tha t Higher Will which is in Kether. Also it is the pecu liaE faculty of Neschamah to aspire unto that which is beyond. The Higher Will manifests itself through Ye chidah. The Chiah is the real Life Principle, as distinct from the more illusionary life of the Phys ical Body. The Shining Flame of the Divine Fire, the Kether of the Body, is the Real Self of the Incarnation. Yet but few of the sons of men know it or feel its presence. Still less do they"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 42 believe in or comprehend those Higher Potencies, An gelic, Archangelic or Divine, of which the manifestation directly touching Yechidah is the Hig her Genius. This Yechidah in the ordinary man can but rarely act through the spiritual consciousness, seeing that for it to do so the King of the Physic al Body, that is the Lower Will, must rise from his Th rone to acknowledge his superior. That is the reaso n why, in some cases, in sleep only doth the Higher W ill manifest itself by dream unto the ordinary man. In other cases it may be manifested; at times through the sincere practice of religious rites, or in case s where the opportunity for self-sacrifice occurreth. In al l these cases the Lower Will hath for a moment recognised a higher form of itself, and the YHVH of the man hath reflected from the Eternal Lord of th e Higher Life. This Yechidah is the only part of the man which can truly say, EHEIEH, I am. This is then but the Kether of the Assiah of the Microcosm, that is, it is the highest part of man as Man.

Recall the Tiphareth clause of an Adeptus Minor: “I furthe r solemnly promise and swear that with the divine permission I will from this day forward apply mysel f unto the Great Work which is so to purify and exa lt my spiritual nature, that with the Divine Aid I may at length attain to be more than Human, and thus gradually raise and unite myself to my Higher and D ivine Genius, and that in this event, I will not ab use the great power entrusted unto me.” Note that this clause answereth unto Tiphareth, seeing that it is the Lower Will that must apply itself unto this work, b ecause it is the King of the Physical Man. All the Shining Ones (whom we call Angels) are micr ocosms of the Macrocosm Yetzirah, even as Man is the microcosm of the Macrocosm of Assiah. Al l Archangelic forms are microcosms of the Macrocosm of Briah, and the Gods of the Sephiroth a re consequently the Microcosms of the Macrocosm of Atziluth. Therefore apply this perfecting of the Spiritual Nature as the preparation of the Pathway for Shining Light, the Light Divine. The evil persona o f a man is in the Sphere of the Qlippoth, and the d evils are the Microcosms of the Macrocosm of the Qlippoth . This evil persona hath its parts and divisions, a nd of it the part which toucheth the Malkuth of the Ne phesch is its Kether. Tremble therefore at the evil forces which be in thy own evil persona. And as abo ve the Kether of a Man are his Angelic and other forms, so below the Malkuth of the Evil Persona are awful forms, dangerous even to express or think of ."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"VOLUME THREE 43 TASK UNDERTAKEN BY THE ADEPTUS MINOR This, then, is the task to be undertaken by the Ade ptus Minor. To expel from the Sephiroth of the Nephesch the usurpation by the evi l Sephiroth; to balance the action of the Sephiroth of the Ruach in those of the Nephesch. To prevent the Lower Will and Human Consciousness from falling into and usurping the pl ace of the Automatic Consciousness. To render the King of the Body, the Lower Will, obedie nt to and anxious to execute the commands of the Higher Will, that he be neither a usurper of the faculties of the Higher, nor a sensual despot, but an Initiated Ruler, and an annointed Ki ng, the Viceroy and representative of the Higher Will, because inspired thereby, in his Kingd om which is man. Then shall it happen that the Higher Will, i.e., the Lower Genius, shall desc end into the Royal Habitation, so that the Higher Will and the Lower Will shall be as one, and the Higher Genius shall descend into the Kether of the Man, bringing with him the tremendous illumination of his Angelic Nature. And the Man shall become what is said of Enoch. “And Ch anokh made himself to walk with God, and he was not, for God took him.” (Genesis, V.v. 2 4.) Then also this shalt thou know, that the Nephesch of the Man shall become as the Genius of t he Evil Persona, so that the evil persona itself shall be as the power of the Divine in the Q lippoth, as it is said: “Whither shall I go from thy Spirit, or whither from thy Presence shall I fl ee? If I ascend up to Heaven, thou art there. If I make my bed in Hell, behold thou art there.” (Ps. c xxxix.) Therefore even the Evil Persona is not so evil when it fulfilleth its work. For it is the beginner of a dim reflection of the Light unto the Qlippoth, and this is what is hidden in the saying that “Typhon is the brother of Osiris.” Hear thou, then, a mystery of the knowledge of evil. The Ritual of the Adeptus Minor saith that ev en the “Evil helpeth forward the Good.” When the evil Sephiroth are expelled from the Nephesch i nto the evil Persona, they are, in a sense, equilibriated therein. The evil persona can be rend ered as a great and strong, yet trained, animal whereupon the man rideth, and it then becometh a st rength unto his physical base of action. This Mystery shalt thou keep from the knowledge of the F irst Order, and still more from that of the Outer World, that is as a formula, seeing that is a dangerous secret. Now then shalt thou begin to understand the saying “He descended into Hell,” and also to comprehend in part this strength, and thus begin to understand the necessity of evil unto the material creation. Wherefore, also, revile not overmuch the evil forces, for they have also a place and a duty, and in this consisteth their right to be. But check their usurpation, and cast them down unto their plane. Unto this end, curse them by the mighty names if need be, but thou shalt not revile them for their condition, for thus also shalt thou be led into error. There is al so a great mystery that the Adeptus Minor must know. How the spiritual consciousness can act aroun d and beyond the sphere of Sensation. “Thought” is a mighty force when projected with all the strength of the lower Will under the guidance of the reasoning faculty and illuminat ed by the Higher Will. Therefore, it is that, in thy occult working, thou art advised to invoke the divine and Angelic Names, so"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 44 that thy Lower Will may willingly receive the influ x of the Higher Will, which is also the Lower Genius behind which are the all-potent forces. This, therefore, is the magical manner of operation of the Initiate when “skrying” in the spirit vision. Through his own arcane wisdom, he knows the disposition and correspondences of the Forces of the Macrocosmos. Selecting not many, but one symbol , and that balanced and with its correlatives, then sendeth he a thought-ray from his Spiritual Conscio usness, illuminated by his Higher Will, directly un to the part of his Sphere of Sensation which is conson ant with the symbol employed. There, as in a mirror , doth he perceive its properties as reflected from t he Macrocosmos, shining forth into the Infinite Aby ss of the Heavens. Thence can he follow the ray of reflection therefro m, and while concentrating his united consciousness at that point of his sphere of sensat ion, can receive the direct reflection of the ray f rom the Macroscosmos. Thus receiving the direct ray as then reflected into his Thought, he can unite himself w ith the ray of his Thought so as to make one continuous ray from the corresponding point of the Macrocosmos unto the centre of his consciousness. I f, instead of concentrating at the actual point of the sphere of Sensation he shall retain the thought-ray only touching the sphere of sensation at that poin t, he shall, it is true, perceive the reflection of the M acrocosmic Ray answering to that symbol in the sphe re of his Consciousness. But he shall receive this reflec tion tinctured much by his own nature, and therefor e to an extent untrue, because his united conciousnesses have not been able to focus along the thought-ray at the circumference of the Sphere of sensation. And t his is the reason why there are so many and multifarious errors in untrained spirit visions. Fo r the untrained seer, even supposing him free from the delusions of obsession, doth not know or understand how to unite his consciousnesses and the harmonies between his own sphere of sensation, and the univer se, the Macrocosmos. Therefore is it so necessary t hat the Adeptus Minor should correctly understand the p rincipia and axiomata of our secret knowledge, which are contained in our Rituals and Lectures.

Regarding the beasts, they are, for the most part, easily obsessed, and t hey have not the spiritual responsibility of the man. Their nature is not evil, but, following a natural law, seeing that man is head of the Assiatic creation, so the animal is higher than the vegetables or mineral. Also bear thou well in mind that the race of the transformers are given un to cruelty. Such are above all the race of creeping things. As Man hath his Ruach which is upr ight in the Tree of Life, so hath the beast his Ruach which is horizontal; as it is said: \"The Ruach of a man which goeth upwards (i .e . dir ecte th its elf u pwar ds) , a nd th e Ru ac h o f t he b eas t whic h goe th do wn ward s (or c ros s wise ) i n the Eart h.\" T he Nes ch a mah i n t he Bea s t is n ot.

Man, therefore, is placed at the head of the beasts . Woe, woe, unto him if he teacheth their elementary Daath cruelty and injusti ce instead of mercy and justice. For the Man is a God unto the beast, and the aspiration of the Beast is toward the Man, and great is the office of the Beast, for he prepareth the found ation for the man. Man is responsible for creation, and since he was originally placed in cre ation to be its Lord, as he is, so will the creation follow him. And thus it is possible for th e Genius of a Nation to change the climate of a country, and the nature of the beasts therein. Men fell from primal estate, and then they who were formless became imaged in form, deformed. And this is a mystery of the Demonic Plane which entereth not into this section.

They ar e as the younger man (i.e. child) and towards them also is Man responsible, and he hath wrought t hem much injustice. OF OBSESSION, TRANCE, DEATH Obsession always entereth through a cutting off of the Higher from the Lower Will, and it is ordinarily first induced by a Thought-Ray of the Sp iritual consciousness (whence one danger of evil thoughts) ill-governed, penetrating the Sphere of S ensation and admitting another potency, either human embodied, or human disembodied, elemental or demonic. The first action of such a force is to flatter the lower will, until he shall have establi shed firmly an entrance into the Sphere of Sensatio n, and thus shall cause a strain on the Nephesch which shall render the Ruach less concentrated. As soon as the Ruach is sufficiently dispersed to repa ir the strain on the physical body, the lower will is weakened, and is soon seized upon and bound by the invader. Whence arise the sensations of chill and drowsiness which are the usual forerunners of obses sion. Now to yield the force necessary to overpower the l ower will from any chance of communication with the higher the obsessing idea pr oceeds by seizing upon the Daath, and this consequently is the great point of attack, especial ly the part in the physical body which is at the ba ck of the head about the junction with the Spine. Now unl ess the lower Will shall voluntarily endeavour to restore the connection, it is impossible for the Hi gher Will to intervene, seeing that the Lower Will is King of the Physical Body. Remember that no obsessi ng force can overpower the lower will, if that shall bravely and in spite of all opposition aspire unto the Higher Will. Trance may arise from the action of obsession, or from the action of the High er Will, therefore its aspects are varied. Death superveneth in the natural man, when the mental act ion of the Ruach and the Nephesch is definitely and thoroughly interrupted in the physical body. In the Adept death can only supervene when the High er Will consenteth thereto, and herein is implied the whole Mystery of the Elixir of Life.

Then, through meditation, he is led to se e himself as not only self-conscious -- as one who receives impressions -- one who criticis es and watches -- one whose will is interfered with -- one who is misunderstood -- one to whom others are `persons' or masks (from Latin persona, a mask) -- but, standing outsi de himself, he now becomes one who endeavours to sense how his mask appears to others -- sees himself as part of the consciousness of others, as one who impresses, one who is critici sed and watched, one who interferes with the will of others, one who misunderstands. He may recall periods in his life when his convicti ons were sure, his judgments harsh and unjust, his actions shameful, and view himself in t hat picture dispassionately as an entity operative in the give and take of Life, something g rowing and as outside the category of blame as is the bitterness of unripe fruit. As the knowledge of his place and relative importan ce in the Universe matures, he will attain strength to be honest with himself -- ashame d of nothing he finds in his mind -- one watching the antics of his personality with toleran t amusement -- yet always learning. He will reflect on words, and the power of words. H e will catch himself weaving them twisting their meaning -- deceiving himself and oth ers with them. He will catch himself under obsession to them -- he will see how they fix and m ake possible the recall of events and emotions, and with this knowledge he will become aw are of how his words affect other people. As he begins to realise the tremendous miracle of w ords, the magic both good and evil of human communion by words, he will begin to grasp why the Order reiterates the importance of silence. The true Magician must understand his t ools and, in periods of silence, he must contemplate words as one of them. As he thus traverses the long road to dispassionate self-knowledge, and no longer has to waste energy in doing battle for and indulging woun ded feelings in defence of a totally false idea of himself, he is led to meditate on the varied sym bols of the cross, and from this to contemplate the Crucified One, revealed to the West as Jesus of Nazareth. (However be cautious not to associate the ideas of Jesus with t he political-religions which have evolved from his teachings. I.R.). This life and the sayings of Jesus given in the Med itations should be studied and pictured in the mind. The mind must be taught to die to useless churnings over past things and vain apprehensions about future things. This is difficul t, for human phantasies die hard, but once the effort is made, however transient the result, it be comes easier with time to replace wasteful thoughts with those that cluster round a powerful s ymbol of eternal truth. As the time for the Adeptus Minor Ceremony approach es, the Aspirant should withdraw as far as may be from externals that these symbols may work in his mind. He will find them waiting on the threshold of his m ind ready to tell their story as he walks about or is occupied in mechanical tasks.

Before going to sleep, the Aspirant should do the P entagram Ritual and impress on his mind that he must recall on waking any teaching tha t has been given him in dream or vision. This may be assisted on waking, if he calls before his mind the Sun rising, thinly veiled in clouds. T his should be done at least the week preceding the Grade. The Ceremony will be a true initiation for the Aspi rant only in so far as he has prepared himself to receive it.

There is no trace of the contents of this mos t important paper in the earlier Order documents. It is obviously therefore written by someone in the Stella Matutina. I sometimes get weary of the constant criticism level ed against the Stella Matutina; I think they are wholly unj ust as this paper demonstrates. It reveals a profound working knowledge of psychological principles which the reader would do well to make an intrinsic part of his mental equipment.

However some little attention and study of its principles s oon convinces one that there is more to it than at first meets the eye. All sorts of hints are scattered throughout the Order documents that add significant clues as to how this rudimenta ry outline can be elaborated into a magnificent workable schema. First of all, there is the Hierophant's speech in the Neophyte Ritual \"all powers can be awakened and re-awakened by names and images\" which is one of the fundamentals of all the Order work, and of cour se especially applicable to this method. Then there is the theory of the Tree of Life projec ted into a solid sphere producing not three Pillars but four surrounding an axis of a Middle Pi llar. In Z-3, the ceremonial circumambulation in the Temple is applied to the Au ra in terms of the circulation of energy within the sphere of sensation, which first gave me the idea of the three types of circulation which came to be an integral idea of my development of this method.

The main thing is to work it a nd use it often, daily if possible in order to b ec o me ful l y a war e of wh at the me th od ca n do.

The second step relates to the practice of regulate d breathing. It is really a simple process. We contemplate the fact that all living pr ocesses are rhythmical, so that at various times during the day we let the breath flow in whil e mentally counting very slowly - one, two, three, four. T hen we exhale counting the same beat. It is fundamental and important that the initial rhythm, whether it be a four or a ten beat rhythm or any other convenient one, should be maintained for some minutes. It is t he very rhythm which accounts for the easy a bs orpti o n of vit alit y fro m with ou t an d t he a c ce lera tio n of th e divi n e po we r wit hin . Cultivate techniques of relaxation to aid this proc ess. These can be learned readily from a h ost of go od b oo ks (The Lazy Man's Guide to Relaxation By Is r ael Re gardi e, F alc on P re ss, 1 98 3) o n th is su bj ect wh ich are rea dil y a vai l abl e at an y go o d b oo kst ore . T he conjunction of relaxation techniques with the pract ice of the rhythmic breath will go far in the process of mobilizing one's energies. One of th e indices of the success of this process is that in a few minutes the whole body is vibrating i n unison with the rhythm of the breath. Every cell appears to vibrate sympathetically, and the whole system comes to feel as if it were an inexhaustible storage battery of power. T he sensation most commonly felt is that t he di ap hra gm i s r ip plin g an d b u zzi n g. Once this has been experienced, then one can refer to the chart depicted in the Portal paper, paying particular attention to the Se phiroth on the Middle Pillar - Kether, Daath, Tiphareth, Yesod and Malkuth.

Keep the mind here for some five minutes or so, by which time it should be seen to glow and scintillate. Then imagine that from this c enter emanates a shaft of white light moving downwards into the Daath center in the neck.

Naturally, this d istance will vary with every person. A technique similar to the above for Kether should be pursued with this sphere, which we name the Air center. It should be strongly and vividly imagined as a scintillating sphere of white light, shining and glowing from wit hin. The divine name pertaining to this sphere is YHVH EL OHIM - p r on ou nc ed as Yuh -h o h -vo h E h -l oh -h ee m. Let the vibratory or humming sound be made a number of times until it is clearly felt as a de fini te se ns or y exp eri enc e. T h ere is abs olu tel y no mi sta kin g th e se nsa tio n of its awakening. About the same time should be spent form ulating Daath or this Air center as was devoted to the Kether center.

S o me st ude nts ha ve complained that the above divine name is excessivel y long and difficult to pronounce.

Both ar e attri but ed Qabalistically to Tiphareth on the Tree, and so are equally valid. It is my experience that this Name is just as effective as is the Hebrew divine Name, and in m y own use of this me d itat io n, it h as b ec o me a pe r man ent part o f t he te ch niq ue . IAO should be pronounced as Eee (as in key) Ah-Oh, and again should be hummed or intoned with vigor. In fact, it is far simpler t o vibrate this name than almost any other, and t he vi brat io n it pro du ces is cl ear a nd st ro n g. When you have felt you've dwelt long enough on this center, continue sending the shaft of light downwards until it reaches the pelvi c area, the region of the generative organs.

SHADDAI EL CHAI is the divine name of Ye sod, where this center is located, and is to be pronounced as Shah-die Ale Chye (reme mber that the ch is gutteral.)

T he Order technique as described in the Portal docu ment then suggests building up the rest of the Sephiroth on the T ree of Life in th e sphere of sensation. My own experience is that this is superfluous. For the purpose that w e have in mind this approach is redundant. The Sephiroth can be placed easily in the aura by a process that I have called the circulation te ch ni que , whic h ca n no w b e de scri be d. T he first step in this approach is to throw the min d upwards to the coronal center, Kether, imagining it to be in a state of vigorous a ctivity once more. In such a state it throws an enormous amount of energy into the Sephirotic sy stem, transforming it in such a way as to make it readily available for any activity in the h uman system. Imagine then that the energy begins to stream down the left side of the body, or Tree, in a broad band extending out some distance from the body. As the current of energy de scends down the trunk and thighs to the feet, try to synchronise the movement of the energy with the breathing process. As the breathing proceeds, let the band of energy pass fro m the left foot to the right foot, and then ascend up the right side of the body to the coronal center once more, returning to the center whence it came. Keep on repeating this process, acc ompanied by the breathing until you can feel the connection between the movement of the energy through the right and left Pillars of the Tree and the inhalation and exhalation of ai r.

Let me preface any furthe r remarks by stating that from the practical point of view, the rudiments of the astro logical schema are of untold value in that they offer a concise classification of the broad di vision of things. I am not here concerned with astrology as such, merely that it is convenien t to use its schema. Its roots are in the seven principal ideas or planets to which most idea s and things may be referred. To each of these root ideas there is attributed a positive and negative colour, and a Divine Name for the purpose of vibration. I propose naming the planets with their principal attributions as follows: Saturn. Older people and old plans. Debts and their repayment. Agriculture and real estate, death, wills, stability, inertia. Positive colour is indigo; negative, black. YHVH Elohim - best pronounced Yuh-hoh-voh Eh-loh-heem. Jupiter. Is abundance, plenty, growth, expansion, g enerosity. Spirituality, visions, dreams, long j ourneys, subjective or otherwise. Ban kers, creditors, debtors, gambling. Positive colour is purple; negative blue. EL, prono unced exactly as written or as Ale. Mars. Energy, haste, anger, construction or destruc tion (according to application). Danger, risks, surgery. Vitality and magnetism, wil l power. Positive and negative colours bright red. Elohim Gibor, best pronounced Eh-loh-he em Gibor. Sun. Superiors, employers, executives, officials. P ower and success. Life, money, growth of all kinds. Illumination, imagination, men tal power. Health. Positive colour orange; negative colour yellow or gold. YHVH Eloah ve-Daath. This is such a long clumsy name, that though traditional I have decided to rep lace it with a much simpler and also traditional name. IAO pronounced ee (as in key) ah- oh. Venus. Social affairs, affections and emotions, wom en, younger people. All pleasures and the arts, music, beauty, extravagance , luxury, self-indulgence. Both of the colours emerald green. YHVH T zabaoth, pronounced Yu h-hoh-voh T zah-bah-oth. Mercury. Business matters, writing, contracts, judg ment and short journeys. Buying, selling, bargaining. Neighbours, giving and obtaini ng information. Literary abilities, publishing, and intellectual friends. Books, papers , etc. Positive colour yellow; negative colour orange. Elohim T zabaoth, pronounced Eh-loh-h eem T zah-bah-oth. Moon. General public, women. Sense-reactions. Short journeys and removals. Changes and fluctuations. T he personality. Positive colour blue; negative colour puce. Shaddai el Chai, pronounced shah-dye ale Chye (gutt eral ch.) These very briefly are the attributions of the plan ets under which almost everything and every subject may be classified. This classific ation is extremely useful because it simplifies enormously one's task of physical and sp iritual development. It can simplify, at least in general theory, much of the practical work of the Order, in fact even enabling one to simplify and classify the work to be done.

Concentrating his faculties on this, as a focus, let him endeavour to realise the Immanance of the Divine throughout Nature, in all her aspects. Begin by finding a position, balanced, but sufficie ntly comfortable. Breath rhythmically until the body is still and the mind quiet. Keep th is state for a few minutes at first and for longer as you get more used to preventing the mind from wandering. Think now of the subject for meditation in a general way then choose out one thought or image and follow that to its conclusion. The simplest rhythm for the beginner is the Fourfol d Breath. 1. Empty the lungs and remain thus while counting 4. 2. Inhale, counting 4 so that you feel filled with b reath to the throat. 3. Hold this breath while counting 4. 4. Exhale, counting 4 till the lungs are empty. This should be practised, counting slowly or quickl y till you obtain a rhythm that suits you one that is comforting and stilling. Having attained this, count the breath thus for two or three minutes, till you feel quiet, and then proceed with the meditation. MEDITATION NUMBER TWO Let the Zelator meditate on a straight line. Let hi m take a ruler or a pencil and by moving it a distance equal to its length, outline a square .

The Order prescribed certain meditations to be done in the intervals between the Grades. There are varying reactions to these - some approving, others disapproving. In order to fill a gap between the studies of the Qabalah an d the more advanced magical work of the Inner Order, gradually over the years I developed a set of exercises that I found to be very useful. They are not, strictly speaking, the tradit ional Golden Dawn exercises or meditations, but they are based essentially on the techniques in vogue in the Order. These exercises will make use of the basic methods of many systems such as rhythmic breathing, the vibration of names, visualisation of images, sigils from the Rose, and many others. I recommend them because they form a kind of bridge between the theo retical work of the Order and the far more technical processes that are given later. Many of these exercises should begin with rhythmic breathing in order to establish some degree of quiescence of body and mind. The Ord er recommended a four fold breath, that is to inhale to the count of four, hold the br eath for the same length of time and exhale to the count of four, and then hold for four. It on ly requires a little practice a couple of times a day in order to achieve some degree of expertise. S ome of the signs of success are: a sense of quiet and stillness both physically and mentally, f eeling as though one has become energised, and above all that there is a rippling s ensation over and around the diaphragm. With a little regular practice, these results will occur fairly quickly. Then you can proceed with the next step. Feel free to modify the breathi ng rhythm. If necessary for your own"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 90 comfort, change the holding period to two instead o f four. Or, leave out the holding period altogether and just breath in to the count o f four and exhale to the same count. Everything d e p en ds o n h o w yo u fee l ab out what yo u a re d oin g. A diagram accompanies this text. It depicts a sigil placed over a human figure. A sigil is simply a traditional technical term meaning a si gnature. It can be derived either from the Rose, as depicted later in this volume, or from a K amea or magical square, also given later. T he signature given in this diagram is based on the Hebrew word Eheieh and is derived from the Rose.

Then visualize this Sigil of the Holy Name in black, not on the surface of your body, but inside, within your own being - not external to you.

Remember, it is of no c onsequence if you find you are wrong when you turn the card up. Consider the whole exper iment as practice or as a game.

Initiation is thus a dual process. To sens itize the lower vehicles and to invoke the higher. Properly speaking, this dual process should proceed simultaneously, but in order to render the certainty of this process, this exercise was devised to ensure compliance with tr adit io n. Sit down comfortably in your straight backed chair, beginning to work on the rhythmic breathing process. Remove shoes or slipper s, so that the feet are placed firmly on the floor. Then try to imagine that flames are shoo ting up from the floor beneath you, flaming not merely around your feet but through the m. Before beginning the exercise, get some idea of what flames look like from a picture o r photograph, or even look at a gas burner. If you have a barbecue in your back yard or have made a bonfire recently, use these as models for your me ntal pict ure s. While working thus, try to feel that your feet are getting hotter and hotter because of the flames underneath. It should not take too long to experience the sensation of heat there, which should make the visualization process much ea sier. if there is some difficulty when first imagining this, do not hesitate to resort to any artifice to help achieve the appropriate sensation. For example, obtain some Sloan's linimen t or Absorbine Jr. or a patent arthritic medication named HEET.

The Chiefs hope th at private differences between members will be amicably arranged in private, as they have no wish to interfere in such matters. Members should at all times be very careful not to shew any disrespect to the personal religious feelings of other members.

They are relatively simple -- but absolutely important. Let there be no equivocation about this. They are so important that I re commend that the y be committe d to memory -- perfectl y and by rote. On ex amining some of the earl y docum ents of the O rd er as well as thos e of the later formulation of the Order, the Stella Matu tina, I am constantly struck by the fact that in the rituals, whether of initiation or of personal growth and developement, the pentagrams and hexagrams pertaining to the oper ation are depicted in diagrammatic form. This eternally surprises me. For despite the fact that the papers on the Pentagram and Hexagram rituals s uggest, nay demand, that the contents be committed to memory, few apparently took this injun ction seriously. Instead of being content with the rubric of the ritual stating that for example the invoking Pentagram of Air should be traced in the Air, or th at the banishing Hexagram of Mercury should be traced, the members whose papers I have seen drew the appropriate figure. This of course suggests that th e figures were not committed to memory, and that the member had to draw the appropr iate figure on the pages of the ritual in order to jog his memor y. Now all of this is totally unnecessary -- which is why I am demanding categorically that the serious student study the fo llowing papers and commit the schema to memory. Try to study the papers with the idea in mind of perceiving the underlying attributions. In that case, should a mom entary doubt arise as to what figure to employ, all one has to do is to visualiz e the attributions to the respective angles, and then recall the basic rules involved. W ith the Pentagrams, the rule is to trace towards the angle involved to invoke, and mov e away from to banish. In the case of the H exagram, the rule is to trace clockwis e from the angle you are dealing with in order to invoke, and anti-clockwise in orde r to banish. It is that simple."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"VOLUME FOUR 9 It is so simple au fond that it puzzles me considerably when I find the Pen tagrams and Hexagrams depicted in diagrams in various ritua ls -- like the Consecration of the Elemental Weapons, etc. It must imply that students are careless, or adopt a trifling attitude towards these basic but most important elements of the art of Invocation. The whole art of Magic is rooted in these basics, without which ther e is nothing but form and emptiness. So let this be a word to the wise. Memorize the bas ics then there will be no problem. In that case one could proceed to the next important p art of ritual, the visualizations. To repeat a former statement, there can be no magical progress without visualizing the lineal figures or the Godforms. Take one step at a time. Start with the b asics first, then proceed to the more complex. The Godforms and the Telesmatic Images are every bi t as important as are the lineal figures -- in fact, more so. They will require a good deal of practise to achieve any degree of skill. All the more reason to memorize what can be called the more mechanical phases of magical procedures. One of the most satisfactory ways of learning these basics is to devise a simple ritual which can be performed daily without too much troub le. It should include the fundamental drills, such as the greater ritual of the Pentagram , plus a dramatic element which will do something to and for the student. Nearly fifty years ago I composed a short, simple r itual which I used every day for practically a year. As time went on, and as I becam e more familiar with the rudiments of the Golden Dawn system, it developed into a species of what I came to call Opening by Watchtower. It employed all the important items of the Greater Ritual plus the use of the Elemental Weapons. As a result, in no time at all, a considerable expertise was obtained in the fundamental principles of magical invocation and ba nishing which has stood me in good stead throughout the years. This really accounts fo r my adamant insistence on the elimination of diagrams of hexagrams and pentagrams in Rituals, which appalls me more and more as I retype some of the earliest documents of the Order. In a book published by Aquarian Press in England, e ntitled Ceremonial Magic, I reproduced this ritual with several variations. The re are innumerable changes that can be rung on a simple theme. The student who really wants to be proficient in the magical arts can take one of these themes which I reproduce somewhere in this book and work it to his considerable advantage. By doing so, he will come to a profound understanding of numberless other schemata which at first sight bear little relations hip to what he is about to do. (By V.H. Frater A.M.A.G.). THE RITUAL OF THE PENTAGRAM The Pentagram is a powerful symbol representing the operation of the Eternal Spirit and the Four Elements under the divine Presidency of th e letters of the Name Yeheshuah. The elements themselves in the symbol of the Cross are governed by Yhvh. But the letter Shin, representing the Ruach Elohim, the Divine Spirit, b eing added thereto, the Name"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 10 becometh Yeheshuab or Yehovashah - the latter when the letter Shin is placed between ruling Earth and the other three letters of Tetragr ammaton. From each re-entering angle of the Pentagram, there fore, issueth a ray, representing a radiation from the Divine. Therefore is it called t he Flaming Pentagram, or Star of the Great Light, in affirmation of the forces of Divine Light to be found therein. Traced as a symbol of good, it should be placed wit h the single point upward, representing the rule of the Divine Spirit. For if thou shouldst write it with the two points upward, it is an evil symbol, affirming the empire of matter over that Divine Spirit which should govern it. See that thou doest it not. Yet, if there may arise an absolute necessity for w orking or conversing with a Spirit of evil nature, and that to retain him before thee wit hout tormenting him, thou hast to employ the symbol of the Pentagram reversed - (for, know thou well, thou canst have no right to injure or hurt even evil Spirits to gratify curiousity or cap rice) - in such a case, thou shalt hold the blade o f thy Magical Sword upon the single lowest point of t he Pentagram, until such time as thou shalt license him to depart. Also, revile not evil spirit s -- but remember that the Archangel Michael of whom St. Jude speaketh, when contending with Satan, durst not bring a railing accusation against him but said ‘The Lord rebuke thee’. Now, if thou wilt draw the Pentagram to have by the e as a symbol, thou shalt make it of the colours already taught, upon the black ground. There shall be the sign of the Pentagram, the Wheel, the Lion, the Eagle, the Ox, and the Man, an d each hath an angle assigned unto it for dominion. Hence ariseth the Supreme Ritual of the P entagram, according to the angle from which the Pentagram is traced. The circle or Wheel answereth to the all-pervading Spirit: The laborious Ox is the symbol of Earth; the Lion is th e vehemence of Fire; the Eagle, the Water flying aloft as with wings when she is vaporized by the force of heat: the Man is the Air, subtle and thoughtful, penetrating hidden things. At all times complete the circle of the place befor e commencing an invokation. The currents leading from Fire to Air and from Eart h to Water are those of Spirit -- the mediation of the Active and Passive Elements. These two Spirit Pentagrams should precede and close Invocations as the equilibrium of the Element s, and in establishing the harmony of their influence. In closing, these currents are reversed.

In the invoking P entagram of Earth the current descendeth from the Spirit to the Earth. In the Banishing Pentagram , the current is reversed. The Sigil of the Ox should be traced in the centre. These two Pentagram s are in general use for invocation or banishing, and their use is given to the Neophyte o f the Order of the Golden Dawn under the title of the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram. This Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram is only of use in general and less important invocations. Its use is permitted to the Outer that Neophytes may have protection against opposing forces, and also that they may form some i dea of how to attract and to come into communication with spiritual and invisible things. The Banishing Pentagram of Earth will also serve thee for any opposing Astral force. In all ca ses of tracing a Pentagram, the angle should be carefully closed at the finishing point. The invoking Pentagram of Air commenceth from Water , and that of Water commenceth from the Angle of Air. Those of Fire and Earth begi n from the angle of Spirit. The Kerubic symbol of the Element is to be traced in the centre . The banishing Signs are reversing of the current. But before all things, complete the circle of the place wherein thou workest, seeing that it is the key of the rest. Unless you want to limit or confine the force, make not a circle round each Pentagram, unless for the purpose of tracing the Pentagram tru ly. In concentrating however the force upon a symbol or Talisman, thou shalt make the circle with the Pentagram upon it so as to concentrate the force together thereon.

Air hath a watery symbol, (Aquarius) because it is the container of rain and moisture. Fire hath the form of the Lion-Serpent (Leo). Water hath the alch emic Eagle of distillation (Eagle’s Head). Earth hath the laborious Ox (Taurus). Spirit is pro duced by the One operating in all things. The elements vibrate between the Cardinal points for th ey have not an unchangeable abode therein, though they are allotted to the Four Quarters in th eir invocation in the Ceremonies of the First Order. This attribution is derived from the nature of the winds. For the Easterly wind is of the Nature of Air more especially. The South Wind bring eth into action the nature of Fire. West winds bring with them moisture and rain. North wind s are cold and dry like Earth. The S.W. wind is violent and explosive -- the mingling of th e contrary elements of Fire and Water. The N.W. and S.W. winds are more harmonious, uniting th e influence of the two active and passive elements. Yet their natural position in the Zodiac is: Fire in the East, Earth in South, Air in West, and Water in the North. Therefore they vibrate: Air between West and East. Fire between East and South. Water between North and West. Earth betw een South and North. Spirit also vibrateth between the Height and Depth. So that, if thou invo kest, it is better to look towards the position of the winds, since the Earth, ever whirling on her poles, is more subject to their influence. But if thou wilt go in the Spirit Vision unto their abode, it is better for thee to take their position in th e Zodiac Air and Water have much in common, and becau se one is the container of the other, therefore have their symbols been at all times tran sferred, and the Eagle assigned to Air and Aquarius to Water. Nevertheless, it is better that they should be attributed as before stated and for the foregoing reason is it that the invoking si gn of the one and the banishing sign of the other counterchange in the Pentagram. When thou dealest w ith the Pentagram of the Spirit thou shalt give the saluting signs of the Adeptus Minor Grade, and for the Earth the Sign of Zelator, and for Air that of Theoricus, and for Water that of Practi cus, and for Fire, Philosophus.

For the same Sign may be in the East at one time of the day and in the West at another.

In certain cases, especial ly when working by or with the forces of the Planets, it may be wise also to use the Lesser Bani shing Ritual of the Hexagram. In order that a Force and a Current and a Colour an d a Sound may be united together in the same symbol, unto each angle of the Pentagram c ertain Hebrew divine Names and Names from the Angelic Tablets are allotted. These are to be pronounced with the invoking and banishing Pentagrams as thou mayest see in this dia grams. The attributions of the angles of the Pentagram are the key of its Ritual.

THE RITUAL OF THE HEXAGRAM The Hexagram is a powerful symbol representing the operation of the Seven Planets under the presidency of the Sephiroth, and of the s even-lettered Name, ARARITA. The Hexagram is sometimes called the Signet Star or Sym bol of the Macrocosm, just as the Pentagram is called the Signet Star or Symbol of th e Microcosm. ARARITA is a divine name of the Seven letters formed of the Hebrew initials of the sentence: One is his beginning. One is his individuality. His permutation is one. As in the case of the Pentagram, from each re-enter ing angle of the Hexagram issueth a ray representing a radiation from the divine. There fore it is called the Flaming Hexagram, or the six-rayed Signet Star. Usually, it is traced with t he single point uppermost. It is not an evil symbol with the two points upward, and this is a po int of difference from the Pentagram. Now if thou dost draw the Hexagram to have by thee as a Symbol, thou shalt make it in the colours already taught and upon a black ground. These are the Planetary Powers allotted unto the Angles of the Hexagram."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 18 The order of attribution is that of the Sephiroth o n the Tree of Life. Hence ariseth the Supreme Ritual of the Hexagram according to the Ang les from which it is traced. The uppermost angle answereth also to Daath and the lowest to Yesod, and the other angles to the remaining angles of the Microprosopus . The Hexagram is composed of the two triangles of Fire and Water, and is therefore not t raced in one continuous line like the Pentagram, but by each Triangle separately. (The exception to this is the use of Unicursal Hexagram, by means of which Hexagram is traced in one continuous line. This is demonstrated at considerable length at the end of this section.) All the invoking Hexagrams follow the course of the Sun in their current, that is from left to right. But the banishing Hexagrams are traced fr om right to left from the same angle as their respective invoking Hexagrams contrary to the cours e of the Sun. The Hexagram of any particular Planet is traced in two Triangles, the f irst starting from the angle of the Planet, the second opposite to the commencing angle of the firs t. The Symbol of the Planet itself is then traced in the centre. Thus in the case of the invok ing Hexagrams of Saturn, the first triangle is traced from the angle of Saturn, following the cour se of the Sun, the second triangle from the angle of the Moon.

But for the Sun all six invoking Hexagrams of the P lanets should be traced in their regular planetary order and the symbol of the Sun t raced in the centre. And for his banishing hexagram also, all the six banishing hexagrams of t he other Planets should be employed in their regular order, only that the symbol of the Su n should be traced therein. (Because all of this is so cumbersome the Unicursal Hexagram is of such great advantage. 1.R.). Remember that the symbol of Luna varieth, and as Mo on in her increase she is favorable. But Moon is not so favourable for good in her decre ase. The symbol of Luna in the centre of the Hexagram should be traced if in her increase; by th e reverse in her decrease. Remember that the symbol in her decrease represents restriction and i s not so good a symbol as the Moon in her increase. And at the full Moon exactly it is repres ented by a full circle but at new Moon a dark circle. The last two forms of Luna are not good in many cas es. If thou wilt invoke the Forces of the Head of the Dragon of the Moon thou shalt trace the lunar invoking Hexagram and write therein the symbol of Caput and for the tail Cauda. These Forces of Caput and Cauda are more easy to be invoked when either the Sun or the Moon is with them in the Zodiac in conjunction. In these invocations thou shalt pronounce the same Nam es and Letters as are given with the Lunar Hexagram. Caput is of a benevolent character, and C auda of a malefic, save in a very few matters. And be thou well wary of dealing with thes e forces of Caput and Cauda or with those of Sol and Luna during the period of an eclipse, for t hey are the Powers of an eclipse.

From the attribution of the Planets, one to each an gle of the Hexagram, shalt thou see the reason of the sympathy existing between each superi or planet and one certain inferior Planet. That is, that to which it is exactly opposite in th e Hexagram. And for this reason is it that the Triangle of their invoking and banishing Hexagrams counter-change. The superior Planets are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars. The inferior Planets are Ven us, Mercury, Luna. And in"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 24 the midst is placed the Fire of the Sun. Therefore the superior Saturn and the Inferior Luna are sympathetic, so are Jupiter and Mercury, M ars and Venus. In the Supreme Ritual of the Hexagram the Signs of the Adeptus Minor Grade are to be given, but not those of the Grades of the First Ord er, notwithstanding these latter are made use of in the Supreme Ritual of the Pentagram. And because the Hexagram is the Signet Star of the Macrocosm or Greater World, therefore is it to be e mployed in all invocations of the Forces of the Sephiroth: though the Signet Star of the Pentag ram represents their operation in the Luna World, in the Elements and in Man. If thou wilt deal with the Forces of the Supernal T riad of the Sephiroth, thou shalt make use of the Hexagrams of Saturn; for Chesed those of Jupiter, for Geburah those of Mars; for Tiphareth those of the Sun, and for Netzach those o f Venus, and for Hod those of Mercury, and for Yesod and Malkuth those of the Moon. Know also that the Sephiroth are not to be invoked on every slight occasion, but only with due care and solemnity. Above all, the forces of Kether and Chokmah demand the greatest purity and solemnity of heart and mind in Shim who would penetrate their mysteries. For such high knowledge is only to be obtained by him whose Genius can stand in the Presence of the Holy Ones. See that thou usest the Divine Names wit h all reverence and humility for cursed is he that taketh the Name of the Vast One in vain. When thou tracest the Symbol of a Planet in the cen tre of a Hexagram, thou shalt make the same of a proportionable size to the interior o f the Hexagram, and thou shalt trace them from left to right generally following the course of the Sun as much as possible. Caput and Cauda Draconis may follow the general rule. When thou shalt invoke either the Forces of one par ticular Planet or those of them all, thou shalt turn thyself towards the Quarter of the Zodiac where the Planet thou invokest then is. For owing both to their constant motion in the Zodi ac and to the daily movement of the same, the position of a Planet is continually changing, and t herefore it is necessary for thee in such a case to erect an astrological chart of the position of t he Planets in the heavens for the actual time of working, so that thou mayest see the direction of e ach Planet from thee. This is even more necessary when working with the Planets than with t he signs of the Zodiac. When thou shalt desire to purify or consecrate any place, thou shalt perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram, either in conjunc tion with, or instead of that of the Pentagram, according to the circumstances of the ca se. For example, if thou hast been working on the plane of the Elements before, it will be wel l to perform the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram before proceeding to thee work of a Planetary natur e, so as thoroughly to clear the places of Forces which, although not hostile or evil of thems elves, will yet not be in harmony with those of an altogether different Plane.

The second form is the ordinary Hexagram with the a ttribution of the angles as usual: the affinity being rather with the Southern Quarter, th e position of Earth in the Zodiac, and of the Sun at his culmination at noon. The third form is: The angles are attributed as shown and its affinity is with the Western Quarter, the position of Air in the Zodiac."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 26 The fourth form is: The angles are attributed as shown and its affinity is with the Northern Quarter, the position of Water in the Zodiac. With each of these forms the Name Ararita is to be pronounced. Also as in the preceding cases there will be seven modes of tracing each of these four forms, according to the particular Planet with those Forces thou art working at the ti me. The Hexagrams of Saturn may be used in general and comparatively unimportant operations, even as the Pentagram. In these four fo rms of the Hexagram thou shalt trace them beginning at the angle of the Planet under whose re gimen thou art working, following the course of the Sun to invoke, and reversing the course to b anish. That is to say, working from left to right for the former and from right to left for the latte r.

ADDENDUM Now in the Supreme Ritual of the Hexagram, when tho u shalt wish to attract in addition to the forces of a Planet, those of a Sign of the Z odiac wherein he then is, thou shalt trace in the centre of the invoking Hexagram of the Planet, the Symbol of that Sign of the Zodiac beneath his own; and if this be not sufficient, thou shalt also trace the invoking Pentagram of the Sign as it is directed in the ritual of the Pentagram. In the tracing of the Hexagram of any Planet thou s halt pronounce therewith in a vibratory manner as before taught, both the Divine Name of the Sephira which ruleth the Planet and the Seven-letterd Name Ararita, and also the pa rticular letter of that Name which is referred to that particular Planet. Now if thou shalt wish to invoke the forces of One particular Planet, thou shalt find in what Quarter of the heavens he will be situate at t he time of working. Then thou shalt consecrate and guard the place wherein thou art by the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram. Then thou shalt perform the Lesser Invoking Ritual of the Hex agram, yet tracing the four figures employed from the angle of the Planet required, seeing that for each Planet the mode of tracing varieth.

When thou hast finished thy invocation thou shalt i n most cases license them to depart and perform the Banishing Symbols upon it which wou ld have the effect of entirely de-charging it and reducing it to the condition it was in when first made --that is to say dead and lifeless. If thou wishest to bring the Rays of all or several of the Planets into action at the same time, thou shalt discover their quarter in the Heav ens for the time of working, and thou shalt trace the general Lesser Invoking Ritual of the Hex agram, but not differentiated for any particular Planet, and then thou shalt turn to the Quarters of the respective Planets and invoke their forces as before laid down; and banish them w hen invocation is finished, and conclude with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram.

The green should be bright Emerald. The wand must then be consecrated. The Wand is to be used in all workings of the Natur e of Fire and under the Presidency of YOD and of the Wand of the Tarots.

The hilt, pommel and guard are to be colour ed a bright pure yellow. Upon this background, the divine and angelic names should then be written with purple or violet colour, together with their sigils from t he Rose, and the motto of the Adeptus.

It is to be used in all works of an Airy nature and under the presidency of VAU and the Sword of the Tarot. Let there be no confusion between the magical Sword and the Air Dagger. They belong to different planes and any substitution of one for the other is harmful. The magical Sword is under GEBURAH and is for stren gth and defense. The Air Dagger is for Air, for VAU of YHVH, and is to be used with the other three elemental weapons.

They must be edged with bright orange colour which must be clear and correct -- an exact complement of the blue, adequate to produce a flashing. The petals may be formed by paint or from coloured paper pasted on the glass. (This is not really practical. If water spills over the rim of the glass, it may spoil altogether the stuck-on- paper.

The white end may be used to banish by tracing a banish ing symbol against an evil and opposing force which has resisted other efforts. By this is meant, that by whatever band you are hol ding the wand, whether by white for spiritual things, black for mundane, blue for Sagit tarius, red for fiery triplicity etc. you are when invoking to direct the white band externally to the quarter desired. When banishing to point the black or lowest end to the quarter. But the Wand is never to be inverted. So when very material forces are concerned, the black end may be most sui table for invocation, but with the greatest caution. In working on the Plane of the Zodiac, hold the wan d by the portion you refer to between the thumb and two fingers. If a planetary working b e required, hold the wand by the portion representing the day or night-house of the planet, or else by the Sign in which the Planet is at the time. Should the action be with the elements, one of the signs of the triplicity of that element should be held according to the nature of the eleme nts intended to be invoked. Thus bearing in mind that the Kerubic Emblem is the most powerful action of the element in the triplicity. Leo-violent heat of summer. Aries-beginning of warmth of spring. Sagittarius-waning of heat in autumn."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"VOLUME FOUR 47 Hold the Wand by the White portion for all Divine o r Spiritual matters, or for Sephirotic influences, and for all the processes of Rising on the Planes. Hold the wand by the black part only for material a nd mundane affairs. The ten upper and inner petals refer to the purity of the ten Sephiroth. The middle 8 refer to the counter-charged natural and spiritual forces of fire and air. The lowest and outer 8 refer to the powers of earth and water. The central amber po rtion refers to the Spiritual Sun. The outer calyx of four orange petals shows the action of the Sun upon the elements perfecting the life of things by differentiation. THE WAND SHOULD NEVER BE USED INVERTED The Lotus Flower is not to be touched in working. I n Sephirotic and Spiritual things however the flower is to be inclined towards the fo rehead.

The lowest arm of the Cross allotted to Earth is of the four colours of Malkuth, the Earth being of the nature of a container and receiver of the other influences. The Citrine answers to its airy part; the Olive to the watery; the Russet to t he fiery part; and the Black to the lowest part, earthy of the Earth. Here is also the Mercurial part chief, but hindered by the compound nature, whence its faculty becomes germinative, rather than mobile. Wh ile the Sulphur and the Salt are respectively from the sides of Water and Fire, which almost neut ralize their natural operation and bring about the fixedness and immobility of Earth. The extremity allotted to fire is of the scarlet co lour of GEBURAH, and in it the Suiphurous nature is chief, whence its powers of he at and burning. The Salt is from the side of water, whence the necessity for a constant substant ial pabulum whereon to act; and the Mercury is from the side of Air, whence the leaping, lamben t motion of flame especially when acted on by wind. The extremity allotted to Water is of the blue colo r of CHESED and in it the Salt nature is chief as exemplified in the Salt nature of the O cean, to which all waters go; and thence also is derived the nature of always preserving the horizon tal line.

In the centre, between the symbols of the Alchemica l Principles of which the outermost is Sulphur, the purgational fire of suffering and self -sacrifice is written in Latin: 'Blessed be the Lord our God who hath given us the Symbol SIGNUM'an d this is a word of six letters, thus representing the six periods (creative) in the Univ erse. And the Regimen of the Planets necessary ere the Glory of the Sun can be obtained. S.R.M.D. NOTE OF MAKING THE ROSE CROSS The Cross may be cut out of cardboard and the colou red portions may be painted or formed by pasting on portions of coloured paper of the required shape. The colours must be correct and clear and brilliant. If they are not th e symbol is useless either as a Symbol or insignium. Actually evil effects may follow if the colours are not clear and brilliant or if they are dirty. If this occurs, the whole should be destroye d, for faulty colours and shapes in Divine Symbols are a degradation of Divine Things and are practical blasphemy, because it is substituting the evil and disorderly for the good. For the petals, one pattern may be designed and sev eral cut at once from it, superimposing several coloured papers. No dimensions are officially given for the Rose Cro ss but pragmatism dictates that it should be about 7-8 inches in length. CONSECRATION OF THE ROSE CROSS 1.

It encloses the aura with a protection against ou tside influences. It is like a veil. The Pentagrams protect, but they also light up the astral and make entities aware of you. They a re more positive for magical wo rking. W hen much distracted, use the P entagrams to banish and the Rose-cross to maintain peace. 2. It is a call to another mode of your consciousnes s and withdraws you from the physical. It is a good preparation for med itation and, combined with the Key-Word, a form of invocation of the Higher Wisdom which is helpful when solving problems or preparing for a difficult interview, or in order to be calm and strong to help another. 3. W hen you are quite familiar with the Ritual, but most certainl y not before, it can be done in imagination while resting or lying down. Part of yourself goes out, and you get all the sensation of walking around your own quiescent body. Used thus, with rh ythmic breathing, it will withdra w your mind from pain (if it be not too severe) and release you for sleep. You can do t he anal ysis of the Ke y-W ord standing behind your ph ysical head, and you can cal l down the Divine White Brilliance, watching it flow over your body and smo oth out the tangles in the etheric double, bringing peace and rest. 4. You can do the Ritual with intention to help others in pain or difficult y. For this purpose, you build up an astra l image of the person, in the centre of the room, and call down the Light upon hi m, after surrounding him with the six crosses. When the ceremony is done, command the astral shape you have made to return to the person, bearing with it the p eace of Yeh eshu ah . 5. It is a protection against ps ychic invasion from the thoughts of others or from disturbed psychic conditions, such as there might be in a place charged with fear, where terrible things had happened.

TALISMANS AND FLASHING TABLETS By G.H. FRATER D.D.C.F. In construction of a talisman, symbolism should be exact and in harmony with universal forces. A Flashing Tablet is one made in the complementary colors (i.e. in the Scale of the King.) A flashing color then is the Complementary Color, w hich, if joined to the original, enables it to attract to a certain extent the Akasi c current from the atmosphere and partly from yourself -- thus forming a vortex which can attract its flashing light from the atmosphere. The complementary colors are: White to Black and Grey Red to Green Blue to Orange Yellow to Violet Olive to Orange Blue-green to Russet Violet to Citrine Reddish-orange to Greenish blue Deep Amber to Indigo Lemon Yellow to Violet Yellow green to Crimson NATURE AND METHOD OF FORMATION OF THE TELESMA. 1. Not always just and right to make a talisman with the idea of completely changing the current of another's Karma. 2. That which assists in material things is often a hindrance spiritually, seeing that for a force to work it must attract elemental forces of the proper descriptions, which may thus to an extent endanger your spiritual nature. 3. In making a telesma for a person, isolate yoursel f entirely from them; i.e. banish love, hate, irritations, etc. 4. See that you are in harmony with the effect you w ish to produce."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 9 5 .

I would also urge the student not to permit first i mpressions of complexity disturb his peace of mind, forcing him to neglect the study of this paper.

T hose in The Magus are replete with multiform errors, as is the execra ble Hebrew that Barrett uses. Most of these errors are readily correctable. However some basic knowledge, such as is given in the Knowledge Lectur es, of Hebrew and Qabalistic numerical manipulations is necessary in order to trace these Sigils on the Kameas. One of the most important tools is the Qabalah of Nine Chambers, or AIQ BEKER. It has been reproduced earlier in these pages. By this method, the letters of the Hebrew alphabet are grouped together according to the similarity of their numbers -- sin ce Hebrew letters are sounds and numbers at the same time. As you will see from the diagram Ale ph - 1, Yod - 10, and Qoph - 100 are grouped together in the first space or chamber beca use they are all variables of 1. So also in the third chamber, Gimel - 3, Lamed - 30, and Shin - 300 are likewise grouped together since 3 is their constant. The same rule applies to all the others -- forming nine groupings or chambers. In order to trace the Sigil of any Name -- and do r emember that Sigil simply means signature -- one must reduce the letters of the Nam e to tens or units as found in the Square. T IRIEL one of the Mercurial names is one which prev iously defied tracing because of errors in the numbering of the square and the carel ess transposition of the shape of the Sigil in older works. However, Teth - 9, Yod - 10 and can be used as such or reduced to 1, Resh - 200 but must be reduced to 20, Yod - 10, Aleph - 1, and Lamed - 30. To trace the Sigil, one starts at the lower left hand corner, moves directl y diagonally to 10 or 1, then again almost diagonally downwards to either 20 or 2 (they are in the same pathway), back to 10 or 1, loops the line because one must return to Aleph - 1 , then somewhat downwards to the left for Lamed - 30 (3 is in the same pathway but lower down.) It sounds complex but a little practice will demons trate its simplicity. The resultant shape may he somewhat different from that given her e -- but the difference is slight and may be put down to artistic license. T he Seal or Sigil of the Planet is a symmetrical fo rm so designed that its traced lines touch every number on the Kamea. Thus the sea l becomes an epitome or synthetic figure of the Kamea. In a small book I wrote some years ago How to Make and Use Talismans I demonstrated a technique whereby ordinary names -- not necessary Qabalistic ones -- may be used in order to initiate a particular current o f force thought to be necessary at a given time. Thus the names Joe Brown or Bill Green, to us e crude examples, may be translated by means of Pythagorean numerology into numbers that c an be traced in a Kamea. If for example, the student of Magic -- say J oe Brown -- f elt sickly, he could make a sigil of his name and number by using the Kamea of the Sun or Ju piter, etc. etc. There are many changes that can be rung on this simple theme."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 43"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 44"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 45"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 46"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 47 So far as concerns the foregoing Sigils, tradition has it that the Spirits are evil, the Intelligences good.

SANDALPHON, for instance is thus analysed: Samekh is Male, Nun is Male, Daleth is Female, Lame d is Female, Peh is Female, Vau is Male, and Nun is Male. Therefore masculine predominates, and if it were an ordinary Name you would make a masculine Form out of it. But this Name is especial ly applied to the feminine Kerub, it is an exception to the rule; it is an Archangelic Name, b elonging to the BRIAT1C world and not merely an Angelic Name relating to YETZIRAH. SAN DALPHON is also called Yetzer, meaning `left', and its letters are: female, female and male, so that, in this case, it may be a ny of these. The Seven Letters composing the Name SANDALPHON are thus adapted to the Telesmatic Image. Samekh is the Head. Would represent a beautiful and active face rather thin than fat. Nun is the Neck, would be admirably full. Daleth is the Shoulders of a beautiful woman. Lamed is the Heart and Chest, the latter perfectly proportioned. Peh is the Hips strong and full. Vau is the Legs massive. Nun (final) Feet sinewy and perhaps winged. Should you desire to build up an elemental form out of this Name a very peculiar figure would result: Samekh -- Head fierce, but rather beautiful. Blue. Nun -- Neck with eagle's wings from behind. Blue- green. Daleth -- Shoulders feminine, rather beautif ul. Green- blue. Lamed -- Chest of woman. Emerald. Peh -- Strong and shaggy hips and thighs. Red. Vau -- Legs of a Bull. Red-orange. Nun (final) -- Feet of an Eagle. Green-blue. This it will be seen, is almost a synthetical Kerub ic Figure. This figure may be represented, as it were, with its feet on the Earth , and its head in the clouds. The colours in the scale of the King would synthesize as a delicate an d sparkling green. The uncovered parts of the body would be blue, the countenance belonging to Sagittarius would be almost that of a horse. The wh ole form would be like that of a goddess between Hathor and Neith holding a bow and arrows, that is if represented as an Egyptian symbol."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 51 If again, we endeavour to translate this Name into symbols on a Tattwic Plane, we get the following: Samekh comes under FIRE Nun comes under WATER Daleth comes under WATER OF EARTH Lamed comes under AIR Peh comes under F IRE Nun comes under WATER. These would be synthesized thus: A silver crescent on a red triangle placed over a yellow square. All three would be charged and enclo sed within a large silver crescent. Now, taking another example, the Telesmatic Image a ppertaining to the Letter ALEPH. T his on the BRIAT IC Plane, would be rather m asculine than feminine and would be resumed by a spiritual figure hardly visible at all, the head-dress winged, the body cloud-veiled and wrapped in mist, as if clouds were rolling over and obscuring the outline, and scarcely permitting the legs and feet to be see n. It represents the Spirit of Ether. In the YETZIRAT IC World, it would be like a Warrior with w inged helmet, the face angelic but rather fierce, the body and arms mailed and bearing a child -- the legs and feet with mailed buskins and wings attached to them. In ASS IAH, this same letter ALEPH is terrific energ y and represents, as it were, mad force (the shape of the Letter is almost that o f a Swastika). On the human plane, it would represent a person who was a lunatic and at t imes given to frightful fits of mania. Translated to the elemental plane, it would represe nt a form whose body fluctuated between a man and an animal, and indeed, the ASSIATIC form would be a most evil type with a force something like that compounded of that of a bird an d that of a demon -- an altogether horrible result. T he Letter ALEPH represents spirituality in high th ings, but when translated to the plane contiguous to or below ASSIAH is usually some thing horrible and unbalanced, because it is so opposed to matter that the mo ment it is involved therein, there is no harmony between them. T his notion is most important and permeates all forms of the Order's magical procedures. Radiating forces of Divine Light, otherwise called Angelic Forms, have not gender in the grosser acceptation of the term, though they ca n be classed according to the masculine and feminine sides. As, for example, in the human f igure, sex is not so strongly marked in the upper part, the head, as in the body, while yet the countenance can be distinctly classed as of a masculine or a feminine type. So, also, on qui tting the material plane, sex becomes less marked, or rather appreciable in a different manner , though the distinction of masculine or feminine is retained. And herein is the great error of the phallic religions -- that they have transferred the material and gross side of sex to D ivine and Angelic planes, not understanding that it is the lower that is derived from the higher by correlation in material"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 52 development, and not the higher from the lower. Gen der, in the usual meaning of the term, belongs to the Elemental Spirits, Kerubic Forms, Fa ys, Planetary Spirits and Olympic Spirits -- also to the Qliphoth in its most exaggerated and be stial aspects, and this is a ratio increasing in proportion to the depths of their descent. Also, in certain of the evil elemental spirits it would be exaggerated and repulsive. But in the higher and angelic natures, gender is co rrelated by forms, either steady and firm, or rushing. Firmness like that of a rock or pillar is the natur e of the Feminine; restlessness and movement, that of the Masculine. T herefore, let this be clearly understood in ascribing gender to angelic forms and images. Our tradition classes all forces under the heads of vehement and rushing force, and firm and steady force. Therefore a figure representing the former would be a masculine and that representi ng the latter, a feminine form. But for convenience in the formation of Telesmatic images of ordinary occult names and words, the letters are arranged in masculine an d feminine classification. This classification is not intended to affirm that the letters have not in themselves both natures (seeing that in each letter as in each Sephirah is hidden the dual nature of masculine and feminine) but shows more their tendency as regards the distinction of f orce beforementioned. Those, then, are rather masculine than feminine to which are allotted forces more rapid in action. And those, again, are rather feminine th an masculine which represent a force more firm and steady whence all letters whose sound is p rolonged as if moving forward are rather masculine than feminine. Certain others are epicene , yet incline rather to one nature than to another. (By G.H. Frater D.D.C.F.) TELESMATIC ATTRIBUTIONS OF THE LETTERS OF THE HEBRE W ALPHABET ALEPH. Spiritual.

SUMMARY In the vibration of Names concentrate first upon th e highest aspirations and upon the whiteness of Kether. Astral vibrations and material alone are da ngerous. Concentrate then upon your Tiphareth, the centre about the heart, and draw down into it the W hite Rays from above. Formulate the letters in Whit e Light in your heart. Inspire deeply, and then prono unce the letters of the Name, vibrating each throug h your whole system--as if setting into vibration the Air before you, and as if that vibration spread ou t into space. The Whiteness should be brilliant. The Sigils are drawn from the lettering of the Rose upon the Cross, and these are in Tiphareth, which corresponds to the heart. Draw themas if the Rose were in your heart. In vibrating any Name, pronounce it as many times a s it has letters. This is the Invoking Whirl. Example: The Vibration of ADONAI HA-ARETZ. Perform the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram in th e four quarters of your room, preceded by the Qabalistic Cross. Then in each quarter give the Sig ns of the Adeptus Minor, saying IAO and LVX, making the symbol of the Rose-Cross as taught in th e paper describing the Rose-Cross Ritual. Pass to the centre of the Room, and face East. Then formulate before you in brilliant white flashings the Letters of the Name in the form of a Cross -- i.e. both perpendicular and horizontal, as seen in the diagram below"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 54 There is another method of assigning gender based u pon whether or not the sound of the HEBREW Letter is arrested or prolonged.

In vibrating the Divine Names, the Operator should fir st of all rise as high as possible towards the idea of the Divine White Brill iance in KETHER -- keeping the mind raised to the plane of loftiest aspiration. Un less this is done, it is dangerous to vibrate only with the astral forces, because the vi bration attracts a certain force to the operator, and the nature of the force attracted rests largely on the condition of mind in which the operator is. The ordinary mode of vibrating is as follows: Take a deep and full inspiration and concentrate your consciousness in your heart, w hich answers to Tiphareth. (Having first, as already said, ascended to your Ke ther, you should endeavour to bring down the white Brilliance into your heart, pr ior to centering your consciousness there.) Then formulate the letters of the Name required in your heart, in white, and feel them written there. Be sure to formulate the l etters in brilliant white light, not merely in dull whiteness as the colour of the Apas Tattwa. Then, emitting the breath, slowly pronounce the Letters so that the so und vibrates within you, and imagine that the breath, while quitting the body, swells you so as to fill up space. Pronounce the Name as if you were vibrating it thro ugh the whole Universe, and as if it did not stop until it reached the further lim its. All practical occult work which is of any use tires the operator or withdraws some magnetism, and therefore, if you wish to do an ything that is at all important, you must be in perfect magnetic and nervous conditi on, or else you will do evil instead of good. When you are using a Name and drawing a Sigil from the Rose, you must remember that the Sephirah to which the Rose and Cr oss are referred, is Tiphareth, whose position answers to the location of the heart , as if the Rose were therein. It is not always necessary to formulate before you in space the telesmatic angelic figure of the Name. As a general rule, pronounce the Name as many times as there are letters in it. (N.B. One of the things that affords me much gratif ication is hearing from a student here and there who has been working the Gol den Dawn system satisfactorily. Every now and then someone calls my attention to a pamphlet or book written by a student who found techniques of c onsiderable worth in this system. For example, a few months ago my attention was directed to ANGELIC IMAGES by a Frater A. H.E.H.O. in England. It is a beautifully written little manual on the use of the Telesmatic Images. As the author states, the technique is nowhere to be found save in the Golden Dawn, yet this is st range, that so formidable a technique has received no further commentary. He pr oposed to remedy the"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 56 deficiency, and indeed has succeeded so well that I strongly recommend the little book. It may be purchased from the Sorceror' s Apprentice, in Leeds, Yorkshire. AHEHO's description of the technique is: As the sap phire is drawn from the earth, rugged and of crude appearance, so do we fin d these two Papers -- archaicly written, disjointed, seemingly in places to be wort hless; but, as the gem is cut and polished to a gleaming splendour, so do these Paper s, when studied and worked upon, synthesize into a gleaming gem, a radiant sap phire, the reflected Light through which may serve to illuminate the dark path ways of the Cosmos. I.R.) AN ALTERNATE METHOD OF VIBRATING THE DIVINE NAMES By V.H. FRATER A.M.A.G. Not long ago, 1 came across a technique which, whil e not essentially Golden Dawn, is so intrinsically in harmony with fundament al principles that I experimented with it to ascertain whether it could be used magically. It could, so I discovered. And a good deal else beside. It also provides a good basis for understanding -- if one was not aware of it before -- the nature of the effect in one's own org anism of the vibration of the Divine Names. One developes a great deal of respect for th e method itself. The latter was reported by a metaphysician by the name of Brown La ndone in a brochure entitled The Great Spiritual Responsiveness of Body and Awak ening the Brain of Spirit. It is a formidable title -- and the principal content is formidable also. Landone describes a simple experiment which is essential to anyone wi shing to employ this method intelligently. Before describing this, let me repeat once more the instructions given in Z. 1. The Symbolism of the Ceremony of the Opening of the Neophyte Grade. `Let the Adept, standing upright, his arms stretched out in the form of a Calvary Cross, vibrate a Divine Name, bringing with the formulatio n thereof a deep inspiration into his lungs. Let him retain the breath, mentally pron ouncing the Name in his Heart, so as to combine it with the forces he desires to awak en thereby. Thence sending it downwards through his body past Yesod, but not rest ing there. Taking his physical life for a material basis, send it on into his feet . There he shall again momentarily formulate the Name. Then bringing it rushing upward s into the lungs, thence shall he breathe it forth strongly, while vibrating that Divine Name. He will send his breath steadily forward into the Universe so as to awaken the corresponding forces of the Name in the outer world. Standing with arms out, in the form of a cross, when the breath has been imaginatively sent to the feet and back, bring the arms forward in the sign of the Enterer while vibrating the name out into the Universe. On completing this, make the Sign of Silence and remai n still, contemplating the Force you have invoked.'"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 57 The alternative method to be described here is not too fundamentally different. In fact, it is id enti cal s a ve i n on e res pe ct. Bef ore d escri b in g th at on e f act , let me de scri be th e e xp eri me nt re co mme n de d b y Br own L an do ne . Take an ordinary piece of dining flatware -- a long spoon or knife or fork, or what not. It makes no difference. So long as it is a metal an d can transmit vibrations readily, that is all that is required. Now take a long piece of ordinary string, about forty inches long. Wrap the middle of this string securely around the spoon (or whatever), leaving the ends free. Hold each end between thumb and forefinger -- one end in both right and left hands, and leaning over, swing the spoon against the edge of a table. Listen to the sound it makes. Depending on the flatware and the table, a certain sound will be struck. T ake note of it. Having done this, take one end of the string and wr ap it around the middle phalange of the index finger. Do this on both the right and left sides. Then insert the tips of the fingers involved into the ear, lightly. Repeat the same exp eriment of swinging the spoon so that it hits against a table or desk. Now determine what kind of sound this spoon makes in the ear. I must confess it rather surprised me when I first perform ed this little experiment. The resultant sound bears little relation to the fi rst sound. It is more like the pealing of cathedral bells. Repeat this several times, so t hat your impression is most clear, and hence c an b e r ec alle d. It is this sound, suggests Mr. Landone, which is ma de whenever we speak, talk or pray. It is this sound which is made when we hum. And it is humming that Landone recommends in conjunction with various prayers etc. that he presc ribes.

I t is solely my recommendation that the humming be employed with the Order's method of vibrating the divine Names, knowing full well from this experiment what the full effect of the formula produces. In all other i nsta nc es of in to nin g th e var io us na me s -- a s in th e Pe nta gra m a nd Hex a gr a m ri tua ls -- follow all the rules and methods described in this paper by the Order. But when breathing out the Name, as described above, hum it out . Do not try to pronounce or vibrate the Name clearly. Hum the Name.

The Name in Hebrew letters riding on the breath, as it were, sh ould be visualized as per the relevant instructions. When the instruction advises that you should imagine that the breath, when quitting the body, swells you up so that you fill u p all space, it should not be too difficult to conceive of the fact that the sound made within, wh ile humming, is doing precisely that. It may of course require a good deal of practice, but I fancy that you will find it is worth the e ffor t. Over my many years of use of the vibratory formula there are a couple of suggestions I would like to offer the student just beginning to work with it. T he first one is to draw the name of the God or Archangel one proposes to work w ith on a large board or piece of paper. Write it with a soft-tipped marking pen, and make t he letters very large. Place it about six to ten feet away from where you are working so that it is within easy vision. So that when attempting to visualize the Name, it will be made e asier by looking at the board first. With a little practice it will be easy to visualize with t he eyes open. If not, open them periodically, casting a swift glance at the name on the board. Th is is an aid to visualization. T h e s ec on d t ip is th at if your a re n ot acc ust o me d t o b ein g h yper ve ntilat ed , pr oce ed slowly. Stand at the foot of a bed, or have a mattr ess placed on the floor where you are working.

FRATER D.D.C.F. ONE The figures of Geomancy consist of various grouping s of odd and even points in 4 lines. Of these the greatest possible number of combinations is 16. Therefore these sixteen combinations of odd and ev en points arranged on four lines are the sixteen figur es of Geomancy. These are again classed under the h eads of the Elements, the Signs of the Zodiac, and the P lanets. Two figures are attributed to each of the S even Planets, while the remainder are attributed to Capu t and Cauda Draconis the Head and Tail of the Drago n, or the North and South Nodes of the Moon. Furthermo re, to each Planet and Sign certain ruling Genii ar e attributed. TWO Roughly speaking, the mode of obtaining the first f our Geomantic figures, from which the remainder of the Divination is calculated, is by ma rking down at random on paper with a pencil held by a loosely tensed hand 16 lines of points or dashes, w ithout counting the number placed in each line duri ng the operation. It should be done very rapidly. All the time think fixedly of the subject of the questi on. When the 16 lines are completed, the number of poin ts in each line should be added up, and if the resu lt be odd a single point or cross should be made in the f irst of the three compartments to the right of the paper.

If a circle be used with the Pentagram, it shou ld be drawn before the latter is described. The Pentag ram should always be of the “invoking” type, as described in the Pentagram Ritual. Since the Pentag ram concerns the element of Earth, it should therefore be drawn beginning at the top point desce nding to the lower left hand point, carefully closi ng the angle at the finish.

It could be intoned two or three times before proceeding with the drawing of the Sigil. This will help to co ncentrate the mind and to elevate it to the highest notion compatible with the method. Do remember that in one of the Ritual obligations, the aspirant swears that in all his magical workings he will alw ays invoke the highest divine names that he knows. Thus he will always be working under the aegis of t he divine. Within the centre of the Pentagram, the Sigil of the “Ruler” to which the matter of the que stion specially refers, should be placed. If the question be of the Nature of Saturn, such as agriculture, sorrow, death, etc., the Sigil of Zazel should be placed in the Pentagram. If of Jupi ter, concerning good fortune, feasting, church preferment, etc., the Sigil of Hismael. If of Mars, war, fighting, victory, etc., the Sigil of Bartzab el. If of the Sun, power, magistracy, success, etc., the Sigi l of Sorath. If of Venus, love, music, pleasure, et c., the Sigil of Kedemel. If of Mercury, such as science, l earning, knavery, etc., the Sigil of Taphthartharat h, etc., If of travelling, fishing, etc., under Luna, then the Sigil of Chasmodai. In the diagram appende d, the Sigil of Hismael is employed. During the marking down of the points, the attentio n should be fixed upon the Sigil within the Pentagram, and the mind should carefully consider t he question proposed. A good idea to to repeat out loud the name of the R uler as if to invoke him. This should also be followed by a short statement repeated again and ag ain concerning the topic of divination. The hand should not be removed from the paper until all 16 l ines of points have been finished. For example if you wished to ask a question concern ing the acquisition of wealth you would use the Sigil relating to Jupiter, Hismael. You would t hen, while making the random dots, repeat three or four times the name of Hismael, followed by, “Will I acquire, such and such amount of money?” (Specify time period. The phrasing of the question should be very definite and specific.) The whole phrase should be repeated frequently until all 16 l ines of dots have been completed."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 63"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 64"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 65 A pencil is preferable to a pen for this task of tr acing the dots. Otherwise, use a contemporary felt pen or marking pen which is ideal for this pur pose. It is practically more convenient to draw or rule four lines across the paper beforehand to mark off the space for such four lines composing a Geomantic Figure as shown on the previous page. The first four Geomantic figures formed directly fr om the 16 lines of points are called The Four Mothers. It is from them that the remaining figures necessary to complete the Geomantic scheme of direction are derived. These should now be placed in a row from right to l eft, for the greater convenience of the necessary calculation though much practice may rend er this unnecessary. The first figure will be attributed to the South, the Second to the East, th e Third to the North, and the Fourth to the West. From these Four Mothers, four resulting figures cal led the Four Daughters are now to be derived, thus: The uppermost points of the First Mo ther, will be the uppermost points of the First Daughter. The corresponding, that is the first line of, points of the Second Mother will be the second points of the First Daughter. The same line of poin ts of the Third Mother will constitute the third po ints of the First Daughter. The same points of the Fourt h Mother willl be the fourth points of the First Daughter. The same rule applies to all the figures. The second line of points of the four Mother figure s will comprise the Second Daughter. The third line of points of the Four Mothers will compr ise the Third Daughter, and the fourth line of poin ts of the Four Mothers will comprise the Fourth Daughter and so on. Applying the above rule throughout, the following w ill represent the Four Daughters:"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 66 These, again for the convenience of the beginner, a re now to be placed on the left hand of the Four Mothers in a single line from right to left. These, again for the convenience of the beginner ar e now to be placed on te left hand of the four Mothers in a single line from right to left. From these eight figures, four others are now to be calculated which may be called the Four Resultants, or the Four Nephews. These will be the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th figures of the whole scheme. The Ninth figure is formed from the points of the first and second figures compared together. The Tenth from the 3rd and 4th figures; the 11th fr om the 5th and 6th figures, the 12th from the 7th a nd 8th figures. The rule is to compare or add together the points of the corresponding lines. If, for ins tance, the first line of the First Mother consists of one point, and the first line of the Second Mother also consists of one point, these two are added together , and since they form an even number two points are marked down for the first line of the Resultant. If the added points are odd, only one point is marked for the resulting figure. The Ninth figure of Conjuncti o is thus formed. Now the first figure has one point at the top, the second figure has one point at the top-together they make two, an even number, thus making 2 points for the new figure. The first figure has one point on the second line, and the second figure has two p oints on the second line.

These three are of less importance than the twelve previous"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 68 figures, and are not to be considered at all in the light of component figures of the scheme, but only as aids to the general judgment. These other figures a re known as the Right Witness, Left Witness, and th e Judge. The two witnesses are without significance in the d ivination, except as they are the roots from which the figure known as the Judge is derived. The Right Witness is formed from the 9th and 10th figures by comparing the points in the manner befor e shown in the formation of the Resultants. That is the corresponding lines of points in the two figure s are compared together, and the addition, whether odd or even, comprises the points of the Witness. The L eft Witness represents the combination in a similar manner to the 11th and 12th figures. The Judge agai n is formed in precisely the same way from the Two Witnesses, and is therefore a synthesis of the whol e figure. If he be good, the figure is good and the judgment will be favourable; and vice versa. From the nature of the formation of the 15th figure, the Jud ge, it should always consist of an even number of points, and never of odd. That is, adding together the four lines of points, comprising the Judge, the result should be an even number. For if the Judge w ere a figure of odd points it would show that a mistake had been made somewhere in the calculation. The Reconciler is a 16th figure sometimes used for aiding the Judgment by combining the Judge with the Figure in the Particular House signifying the thing demanded. Thus, in the preceding scheme, the Judge formed is Populus, and the Second Figure, being Amissio, their combination also yields Amissio. In order to discover where The Part of Fortune will fall, add together all the points of the first twelve figures. Divide that number by twelve, and p lace the Part of Fortune with the figure answering to the remainder. If there is no remainder it will fal l on the 12th figure. The Part of Fortune is a symb ol of ready money, money in cash belonging to the Querent , and is of the greatest importance in all question s of money.

A figure is, therefore, strongest when in what is called its house, very strong when in its exaltation, strong in its Triplicity, very weak in its Fall; weakest of all i n its Detriment. A figure is in its Fall when in a House opposite to that of its Exaltation, and in its Detr iment when opposite to its own house. The Geomantic figures, being attributed to the plan ets and Signs, are dignified according to the rules which obtain in Astrology. Thatis to say they follow the dignities of their ruling Planets, cons idering the Twelve Houses of the scheme as answering to the Twelve Signs. Thus, the Ascendant or First House answers to Aries, the Second House to Taurus, the T hird House to Gemini, and so on to the Twelfth answering to Pisces. Therefore the figures of Mars will be strong in the First House, but weak in the Seventh House, and so forth. TABLE OF DIGNITIES Caput Draconis is strong in the dignities of Jupite r and Venus. Cauda Draconis is strong in the dignities of Saturn and Mars. NOTES The following notes were abstracted from a paper on Geomancy circulated in the A.O., which was the name given to the renewed Golden Dawn by Mathers years after the revolt. In it, the statement is made that it was compiled b y S.R.M.D. from ancient treatises: 1) Ye Geomancie of Maister Christopher Catton; a very old work in black letters. 2) The Theomagia by John Heydon (17th century). 3) And the Geomancia Astronomica of Gerardus CAM BRENSIS or Cremonensis.) In each set of four lines of print, the First or To p line is attributed to the element FIRE (as"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 79 being the most subtle element), the second line to the Air (the next in lightness), the third to the Water (more heavy), and the fourth and lowest line to Earth (the heaviest of all). Further that each set of Four points signifieth an element, thus: The first Four Lines signify FIRE; the second Four the element AIR; the third Four lines the element of WATER; and the fourth Four lines the ele ment of EARTH. In Geomancy there are three points which may tend a little to confuse the Practicus: (a) Why the Names and Seals of the SPIRITS of the Planets are e mployed instead of those of the INTELLIGENCES, the former being said to be more Evil in nature, an d the latter More Good. (b) This being so, why the names and sigils of the Archangels of the Zodiacal Signs, purely Good in Nature, should be also employed; and instead of those of either the Angels , or Assistant Angels of the Zodiac. (c) There bein g 16 figures of Geomancy, and these under the 12 Sign s, how are the 4 extra to be attributed in this classification. (a) Geomancy being a form of Divination especially attributed to the Element of Earth, and therefore more purely Terrestrial in operation, the Spirits and their Characters are more naturally appropriate hereto than the Intelligences, as repre senting the more weighty and automatic force of the Planetary Ray in its action upon the Earth. Also th e Sigils employed in Geomancy are different from those of the same Spirits when taken from the Kamea s of the Planets, and this to affirm their more specialized action in this Art. (b) The reason of the employment of such powerful N ames as those of Malchidael, etc., is to bring a strong aiding Force of Good into the Operat ion, again specialized by the Sigils used in this connection. (c) The 12 Governors of the 12 Zodiacal Ideas or Fi gures, have power over the face of the Earth in their Figures and Places, but the 4 extra which be Fortuna Minor, Via, Caput Draconis and Cauda Draconis, also naturally have re ference to the Four Winds and their Genii; a fortunate phase of the Moon (especially at Full) aspecting, is Good. Gerardus Cremonensis sayeth: But you must always ta ke heed, that you do not make a Question in a Rainy, very Stormy, cloudy, or very Windy Seas on; that is when the Elements be Angry; or when thou thyself art angry, or thy mind over-busied wit h many affairs; nor for tempters nor deriders, neit her renew nor reiterate the same question again under t he same Figure or Form; for that is Error. YE COMPANIE OF HOUSES- From the Geomancie”ofMaister Christopher Cattan. When ye doe find a Good Figure in a good House, it is doubl e Good, because the House is Good and the Figure also; and it signifieth that without any doubt the Querent shall obtain his Demand. By the like reason if ye find an Ill figure in an Ill House it is very Il l for the Querent. But if ye find a Good Figure in an Ill House, it Signifieth Good to the Querent but it wil l not continue, but taketh away part of the Malice of the House. In like case if ye find an Ill figure in a Good House, it taketh away the Malice of the Fig ure, for he would do harm, but he cannot; yet keeping ba ck always the Good that it come not to the Querent. By “Ill House” is meant that which in a Question sh ews persons or things opposed to the"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 80 Querent or to his interest in the Question, as in a Lawsuit, The House shewing his Opponent; in a case of Sickness, the 6th and 8th would be hostil e. “Good Houses” would be those shewing Aid etc. We might in a general sense consider the 6th, and 8 th, (death) and the 12th (Fears, prison, private enemies), “Ill House” by Nature. The “Companie of the Houses” is after three manners : SIMPLE, SEMI SIMPLE, and COMPOUND. And the House be classed in Pairs, thus: the Second House is always the Companion of the First; the Fourth of the Third; the Sixth of th e Fifth, and so on. The COMPANIE SIMPLE is when the same Figure is repe ated in both Houses of any of the “Pairs.” Thus in our Scheme, VIA is repeated in the PAIR formed by the Ascendant and the Second House and they are therefore in COMPANY together. I n this case shew that the indecision of the querent re-acts on his business. But though Caput Draconis is repeated in the Fourth and Fifth houses which be next each other, there is no COMPANY, for they belo ng to different pairs, the Fourth house being the Companion of the Third and not of the Fifth, and th e latter being Company to the Sixth and not to the Fourth. And with regard to Persons, the COMPANION F igure will shew the COMPANIONS or Associates of a Person in question, as also will th e COMPANION House. Good Figures in COMPANY show much Good, and as well in the Present as in th e time to come; and Evil Figures the reverse. For also the First House (of a Pair) showeth the Time P resent, and the Second the Time to Come. The COMPANY DEMI SIMPLE is when the Figures in the Two Houses forming a Pair be not identical, but be under the same Planetary Ruler as Acquisitio and Laetitia which be both under Jupite r and Hismael, Fortuna Major and Minor under the Sun, Puella and Amissio under Venus, etc. The COMPANY COMPOUND is when the Points of the Two Figures be the exact complementary contrary one of the other in arrangem ent as Puer and Puella, Albus and Rubeus, Acquisitio and Amissio, Laetitia and Tristitia, etc . A Reconciler figure is then formed from them in t he same way that the Judge is calculated from the Two Witnesses, and according as this Figure is harmonized with such and Good, so is the nature of this “Company Compound,” but if discordant and evil so is this form of COMPANY. There is also yet another kind of COMPANY which is that of the uppermost Line of the Two Figures in the Pair of Houses. If this uppermost li ne in both cases be odd or even, there is COMPANY, and as in the case of the COMPANY COMPOUND, a Recon ciler Figure is formed and the case judged as in the last paragraph. But if the top line of th e one be odd and the other be even there is no COMPANY between those Figures. In our Scheme Tristi tia is in the Third and Caput in the Fourth House, and as the top line of each has even points there is COMPANY between them. The Reconciler Figure will be Conjunctio, which is Harmonious with Both and is an argument of Good being signified thereby. The reference in the above to “our scheme” only mea ns that Mathers had set up a divination in full, with its complete interpretation. I have not included it here because it would be redundant; one is already included in this text."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 81 S EVEN Remember always that if the figures Rubeus or Cauda Draconis fall in the Ascendant, or fir st h ous e, t he fi gu re is n ot fit f or J u dgme n t an d sh oul d be d est ro yed wit ho ut consideration.

I would like to deal with a topic that is considere d to be at the heart of the magical system. Crowley for example, whose contribution to the subject can hardly be called minimal, considers the Body of Light technique of prime impo rtance. In fact, he has formulated Liber Samekh, one of the most significant of the rituals of his own Order dealing with the knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, around the Body of Light technique. There can be no possibility of performing this ritual without considerable skill in this art. In the Golden Dawn itself, many of the primary magical skills, if not wholly dependent on this skill, at least need to bring it into play for those skills to beco me effective. For example, in Tarot divination, you will often find the advice given by Mathers to use clairvoyance to divine the significance of any one card. It must be added here that clairvoyan ce, in the Order sense of the term meant seeing with the inner eye, the eyes of the Body of Light. Furthermore, most of the Enochian system, the crown and jewel and synthesis of all th e Golden Dawn teaching, devolves upon the Body of Light Technique for full use of the system. The discussion of this topic must revolve around th ree different headings: 1. The Order method, sometimes referred to as Tattwa vision, or skrying in the spirit vision. 2. The Inner Guide Meditation of Edwin Steinbrecher, now achieving considerable popularity. 3. Aleister Crowley's method, previously referred to as the Body of Light Technique. 1. This method is described in several places in th e Order teaching. For example, in the paper entitled \"Man, the Microcosm\" it is described at some length. Then there is a so-called flying roll where the description covers some sever al pages. Here and there in many other documents, it is further described. \"The subject of clairvoyance must always be in the highest degree interesting to all who are aspiring after adeptship even in its lowest gra des... We frequently meet with two opposite attitudes towards the subject, both in the outer wo rld and amongst our junior members. Both these attitudes are hindrances to its proper study, and therefore I shall preface my remarks by a few words concerning each of them.\" (I should inter polate here that these remarks were made by G.H. Frater Felkins.) \"The first is fear of clairvoyance, and the second is a disproportionate estimate of its value. \"Both of these attitudes arise from a misunderstand ing of its true character. People imagine that somehow the power of clairvoyance is o btained secondhand from the powers of evil; or"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 84 that its exercise will bring those who practice it under their influence. Or, on the other hand, they imagine that the power of clairvoyance w ill save them a great deal of trouble, and give them a short and easy path to the information and guidance they desire, in fact, that these may almost be attained at will. Nay more, would suc h a power not fully satisfy that curiosity which is one of the pitfalls of the superficial stu dent? \"The properly trained clairvoyant need have no fear that he will thereby expose himself to the powers of evil. It is the untrained natural clairvoyant who is in danger. Training will give him knowledge, discipline and protection, such as will protect him from the onslaughts of the averse powers. \"On the other hand, let him who desires to save him self trouble and to gain knowledge to which he has no claim, be very well assured that only `in the sweat of his brow' can he obtain this power and exercise it in security. And that he who seeks to gratify his curiosity will either he mortified by disappointment or distressed by discov eries he would much prefer not to have made. Trained, humble, and reverent clairvoyance is a gre at gift, opening up new worlds and deeper truths, lifting us out of ourselves into the great inpouring and outpouring of the heart of God.\" Most of the following quotations are from a rather lengthy flying roll, #11 actually, written by G.H. Frater D.D.C.F. on clairvoyance. \"W e pass through life affecting others, and being affected by others through these akashic enve lopes that surround us -- so that when we close the eyes of the body and senses upon the mate rial world, we first apprehend by interior vision the essences of our own and contiguous natur es. This perception of our own environment is a source of error to the beginner in clairvoyanc e. He believes himself to have gone away and to see elsewhere, but he may be among only the conf used images of his own aura.\" \"An old name of clairvoyance, in our ancient manusc ripts was `skrying in the spirit vision;' becoming a `skryer' was not simply becomin g a seer, but one who descries what he seeks, not only the impassive receiver of visions beyond c ontrol or definition. When one stands in common life in the kingdom of Ma lkuth, there is but little confusion of sight, but when one voluntarily leaves the dead level of materialism and passes up the path of Tau towards Yesod, then there is a conf usion of lights. One comes within the scope of the crossing and reflected and coloured rays of the Qesheth, the rainbow of colours spread over the earth. Here then we require instruction an d guidance to avoid confusion and folly. And yet this stage must be passed through -- to go high er. \"Beyond Yesod you enter the path of Samekh, the str ait and narrow path which leads to truly spiritual regions of perception. This is atta ined by the process called rising in the planes. \"Our subject falls most conveniently into three hea ds, which are however closely related, and the three forms or stages pass one int o the other. \" I. Clairvoyance. Descrying in the spirit vision. \"2. Astral projection. Traveling in the spirit visio n. \"3. Rising in the planes. \"It is well to commence (1) by means of a symbol, s uch as a drawing, or coloured diagram, related in design, form and colour to the subject chosen for study. The simple and compound Tattwa emblems are suitable for this purpo se. It is better for them not to be in the complementary"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 85 \"flashing\" colours for this purpose as though more powerful, they are also more exhausting to the student. The symbol should be of convenient size, for the eye to take it in at a glance, and large enough not to require too close a n application of sight to realize the details...(The Tattwa scheme is nearly the same as our queen scale of colour applied to the Sephirotic colours in the Minutum Mundum diagram).. .To use the symbol for clairvoyance, place it before you, as on a table, place the hands beside it, or hold it up with both hands, then, with the utmost concentration, gaze at it, comprehe nd it, formulate its meaning and relations. When the mind is steady upon it, close the eyes and continue the meditation. Let the conception still remain before you. Keep up the design, form a nd colour in the akashic aura, as clearly as they appeared in material form to the outward seein g. Transfer the vital effort from the optic nerve to the mental perception, or thought seeing as distinct from seeing with the eye. Let one form of apprehension glide on with the other -- produce the reality of the dream vision, by positive will in the waking state. All this will be possible only if the mind is steady, clear and undisturbed, and the will powerful. It cannot lead to success if you are in an unsuitable state of anxiety, fear, indignation, trouble or anticipation . You must procure peace, solitude and leisure, and you must banish all disturbing influences. \"Above all, never attempt these magic arts if there be any resentment in the mind, anger, or any evil passion. If you do, the more you succee d, the greater will be the evil that will follow for yourself. \"With the conditions favourable, the process may be continued and this, by means of introducing into the consciousness and by formulati ng into sound, the highest divine names connected therewith. This invocation produces and h armonizes currents of spiritual force in sympathy with your object. Then follow with the sac red names of archangelic and angelic import, producing them mentally, visually and by voice.\" However casually this may have been stated, nonethe less this is the essence of the difference between the Golden Dawn method and that of the inner guide meditation. I shall have more to say about this when this particular method is being discussed, but nonetheless it should be emphasized right here. The reader should have no ticed that in one of the obligations that the initiate into the Order has assumed there is the st atement that no matter what type of magical operation he proposes to engage in, he will always invoke the highest divine names within his purview. In this way, his steps will be guided in t he right direction and all harm thus avoided. In a major sense this is one of the greatest differences between the initiated and profane points of view. It holds good in all occult matters -- from s o apparently a prosaic undertaking as divining by means of geomancy to invoking one's higher and d ivine genius. It means placing one's workings and one's goal in the hands of the divine -- no matter how one defines the latter. Now we can return to the long quotation about clair voyance by Mathers: \"Then, maintaining your abstraction from your surroundings , and still concentrating upon the symbol and its correlated ideas, you are to seek a percept ion of a scene, panorama, or view of a place. This may also be brought on by a sense of tearing o pen, as a curtain is drawn aside and seeing the `within' of the symbol before you. As the scene dawns upon you, particularize the details,"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 86 and seek around for objects and then for beings, en tities and persons -- attract their attention, call mentally to them by suitable titles and courtesies, and by proper and appropriate signs and symbols, such as the sign s of the grades, pentagrams, hexagrams and sigils, etc.\" Again, let me call attention to this statement as b eing one of overwhelming significance and importance. It is another one of those differen ces between an initiated and a profane point of view or technique. All the correspondences that the student has been obliged to learn and memorize before he even attempts this kind of train ing now come into use. They are the means whereby he attempts `to test the spirits, whether t hey be of god or the devil.' If the student has elected to travel upon the path of Saturn leading f rom Malkuth to Yesod and feels that somehow all is not going well, and because of that makes th e invoking or banishing hexagrams of Saturn, even drawing in the air before him the astrological symbol of Saturn and the Hebrew letter Tau to which this path is attributed, he will find that th ere will be changes in the visual environment in which he finds himself. The tracing of the appropri ate symbols and the vibration of the appropriate divine names eliminates all those thing s which have no place in vision. Thus the details which may represent delusion and deception are banished from the scene enabling him to proceed safely with his mission of investigation, e tc. \"Test them by divine and angelic names, observing t heir attitude and responses thereto. Thus losing sight of the symbol you see its inwardn ess, perceive things as in a mirror by reflection. In this form of descrying, note that yo u see objects reversed, as to right and left, for which suitable allowance must be made. You project; in this process, part of your own nerve and spirit force upon the symbol, and by this you a ttract and attach to it more akashic force from the environment, hence the results obtained. If, in stead of this simple spirit vision, a ray of yourself is sent and actually goes to a place (astr al projection) there is not necessarily the sense o f reversal of objects. \"In using symbols it is necessary to avoid self hyp notization, for this occurrence would dispose you to mediumship, and to be the playground of forces you must control and not permit to control you. For this reason, partly, it is well not to have the symbol too small. It is of advanta ge to pursue these researches with the aid of the pres ence before you of the four magical implements, and even to hold the one suitable to the investigat ion. If you enter upon the spirit vision without a symbol you proceed by a mental symbol imagined in t he astral light. This is not a wise proceeding for learners because it opens the door t o other astral effects. You create a vortex into which other astral influences are drawn and hence c onfusion and mischief may result. \"The process of working by a small symbol placed up on the forehead or elsewhere is not wholly good either. It is more liable to derange th e brain circulation and cause mental illusion and disturbance, headache and nervous exhaustion than t he first method. \"In using symbols placed before you, it is a useful addition to provide a large circular or square tablet, around which are placed divine names etc., related to the elements, and to the cardinal points. Then after duly arranging this wit h respect to the compass, place your symbol upon and within this frame. \"Astral projection, although from one point of view a development of clairvoyance, yet is from another quite distinct. I n astral projection, the adept emits from his ego a perceptible"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 87 ray of his identity, and by cultured and trained wi ll, sends it to travel to the place desired, focusses it there, sees there, directly an d not by reflection, perceives its bodily home, and re-enters it. \"In this traveling of the spirit, the process may b e caused to start also by the symbol as before, or by will alone. But in any event the divi ne names should be used and relied upon. If the ray be emitted, and you succeed in this traveli ng to the place, you perceive a different result to that of the clairvoyant, mirror-like vision, sce nes and things instead of being like a picture, have the third dimension, solidity. They stand out first like a bas relief, then you see as from a balloon, as it is said, by a bird's eye view. You f eel free to go to the place, to descend upon it, to step out upon the scene and to be an actor there. \"Having attained success in projection you should p ractice the method when opportunity offers, and having passed to any place, should make efforts -- and if you will -- success will follow -- to pass through all elements , water and earth as well as through air. Practice will enable you to fly through air either quickly or slowly as willed, and to swim through water, or pass through earth and through fi re fearlessly with the aid of the divine names, in this astral projection.\" Once again, Mathers is stressing the initiated view point, the vibration of the divine names in order to achieve one's ends and to get to where one wishes to go without undue opposition or difficulty. He stresses this as often as possible to ensure that the idea is driven home, and that the method be used on all possible o ccasions. The above section also stresses the use of the magical implements in all such under takings -- implements which have been made and charged and consecrated by the student him self for use in just such circumstances. It is only when these basic rules are not scrupulously and faithfully followed that some mishap or disaster may occur. Crowley's method, which is real ly that of the Order, follows this procedure --Steinbrecher's does not. \"Seek then the forms and persons of the place or of the plane you read, seek converse with them, by voice, word, letter and symbol, and c laim admission, etc. by signs and by invocation. Every figure is to be tried and tested, whether he be as he appears or whether a delusory and deluding embodied power. It may be too that your travel is not real, and that you are wandering in your own environment, and are misl ed by memory, etc. hence you might be deceiving yourself by your own reminiscences. \"Try all beings, and if offered favours or initiati on by any, try and test them by the divine names and forces. And ever remember your own adept obligation and your allegiance to it, to your own higher self, and to the great angel Hua, before whom you stood fastened to the cross of suffering, and to whom you pledged your ob edience. \"This old proverb enshrines a great truth, as many of them do. `Believe thyself there and thou art there.' \"Rising in the planes is a spiritual process after spiritual conceptions and higher aims; by concentration and contemplation of the divine, y ou formulate a Tree of Life passing from you to the spiritual realms above and beyond you. Pictu re to yourself that you stand in Malkuth-- then by the use of the divine names and aspirations you strive upward by the path of Tau toward"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 88 Yesod, neglecting the crossing rays which attract y ou as you pass up. Look upwards to the divine light shining down from Kether upon you. From Yesod leads up the path of Temperance, Samekh; the arrow cleaving upward leads the way to Tiphareth, the great central sun of sacred power. \"Invoke the great angel Hua, and conceive yourself as standing fastened to the cross of suffering, carefully vibrating the holy names allie d to your position, and so may the mental vision attain unto higher planes. \"There are three special tendencies to error and il lusion which assail the adept in these studies. They are: memory, imagination and actual s ight. These elements of doubt are to be avoided by the vibration of divine names, and by th e letters and titles of the `lords who wander' --the planetary forces represented by the several d ouble letters of the Hebrew Alphabet. \"If the memory entice thee astray, apply for help t o Saturn, whose Tarot title is `the great one of the night of time,' formulate the Hebr ew letter Tau in whiteness. \"If the vision change or disappear, your memory has falsified your efforts. If imagination cheat thee, use the Hebrew letter Caph for the forces of Jupiter named `lord of the forces of life.' If the deception be of lying -- in tellectual untruth, appeal to the force of Mercury by the Hebrew letter Beth. If the trouble be of wav ering of mind, use the Hebrew letter Gimel for the Moon. If the enticement of pleasure be the error, then use the Hebrew letter Daleth as an aid. Use the Hebrew letter Peh for Mars to coerce s ense of anger and violence. Use the Hebrew letter Resh for the sun to coerce sense of haughtin ess and vanity. \"Never attempt any of these divine processes when a t all influenced by passion or anger or fear. Leave off if desire of sleep approach. Nev er force a mind disinclined. Balance the Mem and Shin of your nature and mind, so as to leave Al eph like a gentle flame rising softly between them. \"You must do all these things by yourself alone. No one can make you nor take you. Do not try to make, or take others. You may only point out the path and guide, but must not help others. \"A strong person can galvanize a weak one, but its effect is only a temporary folly, doing good neither to the strong nor to the weak. O nly offer guidance to those who are making necessary efforts of themselves. Do not assist a ne gligent pupil, nor encourage one whose desire is not in the work. \"This rule is open to some alteration when, passing from our mystic studies, you refer to the worldly guidance of childhood. A parent is i n a special position, and has a natural duty incumbent upon him or her to train, guide and prote ct a child. \"Still, even here, do protect and lead, but do not `obsess' a child; don't override by your peculiar personal predilections all the personal ai ms of the offspring. A man's ideal of true propriety is often himself, and his idea of doing g ood to a child is to make it like himself. Although this father may be a good man, his form of goodness is not to be made a universal type, and there are many other forms equally existi ng, and equally fit to exist, and any attempt to dictate too closely a child's `thought life' may, w hile failing of success, yet warp aside from the truth what would otherwise pass into a good path, t hrough its own peculiar avenue.\""},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 89 \" I t is well to make all symbols for clairvoyant use yourself. Otherwise, to obtain a purely individual result, you have to banish the in fluence of him who made them. \"It is best to do high clairvoyance alone, or only with others of the utmost purity, and in whom you have the utmost confidence. \"If more than one is attempting in concert the same process, there is the source of error that there becomes formed in the astral light a com plex symbol, and struggle ensues as to who shall lead the direction of the currents. When two sit together, as in the vault, they should be balanced. And so with three. For two, one each side of the Pastos or one at each end, for three assume the position of the angles of a triangle, sa y one at head of Pastos, one at the right and at the left hand of the form of Christian Rosy Cross.\" Example: The V.H. Soror V.N.R. 6-5 sat at a table, robed, and took a Tattwa card coloured symbol (Tejas -- Akasha) an erect red tria ngle upon which is a dark violet or black egg shaped centre. She placed her hands beside her side , or held it in turns before the eyes (held the magic fire wand). Gazed and contemplated and consid ered as the symbol grew before her, so enlarged and filled the place, that she seemed to p ass into it, or into a vast triangle of flame. She realizes that she is in the presence of a desert of sand, harsh, dry and hot. Thinks of, and vibrates Elohim. Action seems set up , increase of heat and light. Passing through the symbol and scene, she seems to arrive a nd descend there, feels the hot dry sand -- perceives a small pyramid in the distance. Wills to rise up and fly through air to it, descends beside it, passes around, sees a small square door on each side. Vibrates -- Elohim, Michael, Aral, Seraph, Darom, Ash. Stamps five times, figure appears at an entrance, s tamps again five times and vibrates Seraphiel. A warrior figure leads out a procession of guards, she asks for his seal, he shows a complex symbol of four triangles around a central e mblem? Deceptive, draw Beth before him -- he appears terrified. Withdraw symbol, he is courte ous, ask him about pyramid. He says they conduct ceremonies there. She seeks admission, give s sign of 0-0 grade. There is a sense of opposition. Gives sign of 1-10; this appears to suf fice. But he gives signs of adeptship. Guards kneel before her and she passes in. Dazzling light, as in a temple. An altar in the midst, kneeling figures surround it, there is a dais beyond and man y figures upon it. They seem to be elementals of a fiery nature. She sees a pentagram, puts a Leo into it, thanks the figure who conducts her. Wills to pass through the pyramid, finds herself ou t amid the sand. Wills her return. Returns, perceiving her body in robes seated in the second o rder hall. Another instance of such visionary experience I rec orded many years ago in an essay now published under the title of The Foundations of Practical Magic -- the essay itself being entitled The Art and Meaning of Magic. It was a Tattwa Vision of dealing with the 32nd path on the Tree of Life. \"We marched down the wide indigo road. There was a cloudy nightsky -- no stars. The road was raised above the general level of the ground. There was a canal each side beyond which we could see the light s of what appeared to be a large city. We went on like this for a long way, but then I notice d in the distance a tiny figure of a woman, like a miniature -- she seemed to be naked, but as she d rew near, I saw a scarf floating round her.

Simplicity itself is the keyword to the method d escribed by Edwin Steinbrecher. He is an astrologer, well-versed in associated subjects, such as tarot, alchemy, qabalah, etc., and underwent a lengthy Jungian analysis. In the latter he was instructed in Jung's technique of creative imagination. By this means, to put it crud ely and oversimplified, one carries on conversations with the images and personalities see n in dreams. Apparently some quite interesting results follow from this procedure. One interesting example is The Tree by J. Marvin Spiegelman (Falcon Press, 1982), which the author describes in his introduction as an experiment in creative psycho-mythology. The book is based on some interio r experiences and conversations the author had with some of his dream images, described at con siderable length. As Steinbrecher describes it, the Inner Guide Medit ation is a \"transformative process concerned with assimilating the disparate energies which exist in the human unconscious into the unified wholeness that is the awakened enlighte ned being inherent in each of us, thus ending the illusions which cause separation, guilt and jud gment. With the meditation of the inner guides, problems once unapproachable and unchangeable becom e fulfilling challenges that bring forth productive and creative responses.\" Let me quote the author as he describes the process of meditation, after which I would like to discuss a description given of a rather fri ghtening experience he had. This latter could have readily been obviated had he known beforehand something of the Order method as given earlier. \"Close your eyes, and invent a cave around you as i f you had just walked into the cave and the entrance is at your back. Allow the cave to structure itself as it will, well-lighted or dim, smooth walled or rough. Try to be like blank film r eceiving impressions. Accept these impressions uncritically as they come to you from t his environment. Try not to edit what comes.\" So far so good. This is the essence of the Jungian method. \"Be as sensory as you can...use all your senses...b e sure you are observing and sensing this environment while being in your body and looki ng out of your eyes. Don't be watching an image of yourself!... \"When you can feel yourself in the cave, even thoug h things may still be vague at this point, move to the left, away from the cave entranc e, and find some kind of doorway or opening"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 91 there on the left that will lead you out into a lan dscape...take a step out into the landscape when it appears, feeling the new type of ground under your feet.

The true guide's face will clear and come into focus later o n as you work with him -- when you stop trying to \"make him a face.\" Be sure to ask the fig ure if he is your true guide. Generally a false guide will answer \" n o \" to this question. Feel the g uide's feeling for you. There is no love from a false guide. \"Ask the guide to take your right hand in his left. ..feel the hand contact as much as you can...then ask the guide to point to where the sun is in the sky of your inner world.

The book is well worth reading, and the method of course experimented with. I recommend it unequivocally -- at least as a device for dealing with the inner world of the spirit. Wha t I am interested in at this moment is to analyze briefly a couple of the problems he encount ered as relative to the meditation. For example, he describes how the meditation evolve d. He was undergoing Jungian analysis many years ago. At one point his analyst l eft town for Zurich where the Jungian Institute is located, and he was left with a feelin g of being stranded, that his unconscious had been activated but, at that moment, not going anywhere i n particular. He had been using the \"active imagination\" technique the analyst had taught him a nd was fascinated by the living experiences he had while exploring his psyche. He had been warned about the potential dangers of the"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 92 process, that repressed unconscious forces could we ll up to overcome the ego and usurp it. However despite that warning, he continued expe rimenting with the method trying to establish relationships between the tarot and astrology. (He was a professional astrologer at the time.) He wrote: \" I was delighted with my new toy. It had a reality and a freshness I hadn't experienced since childhood, and there was no doubt about the experiential realness of it...but then I had an experience that acutely demonstrated the analyst's warning about the dangers of active imagination as it is practiced in analytical psychology. It was inside the room where I came into contact with the archetypal forms when an image of the tarot old Pan or devil appeared, unsummoned and unwanted. It was a classic christian devil with an emanation of `evil' as real as the beneficence I had felt when i nteracting with the archetype of the sun...I was paralyzed. I began to panic. I seemed to be frozen in the chair. The old Pan entity became even more menacing than before, placing himself in my in ner world between me and the stairway to the outer world and safety. The panic finally subsided (although not the fear) and I further tried to manouevre to the stairway around the figure, but to no avail. This entity of the inner world blocked my every move whenever I attempted the stai rs. He did not advance towards me but remained as a moving barrier to any possible exit. It even crossed my mind that I might be discovered by the outer world in this catatonic sta te and be taken off to the nearest psychiatric hospital. I couldn't even call out to try to commun icate my situation to anyone who might he within hearing...the experience was so frightening to me, however, that I decided then and there never again to attempt another venture into the rea lms of the unconscious without the presence of a trained analyst.\" Eventually, however, he recovered from that fright -- as we might have anticipated. The point I wish to emphasize here however is that all this terror could have been obviated, without any difficulty. had he been trained (or trained him self) in those Golden Dawn methods that are being described in this section. The Banishing Ritu al of the Pentagram, the vibration of the appropriate divine names, the assumption of god for ms, etc. are all devices which the student must have mastered long before attempting to enter the i nner world by means of Tattwa Vision, etc. In a well-regulated temple, these fundamental techniqu es would have been taught regularly and gradually to the aspirant so that by the time he wa s ready to attempt this kind of inner adventure these techniques would have been well ass imilated and become second nature. One might well ask, then, that if this is the case why were there so many disasters in the Order as a result of the use of inner vision? The a nswer is so simple as almost to be frightening. These methods were not being used as scrupulously as they should have. Man y assumed that since they had used the visionary techniques for a long period of time, they had no further need for the protective devices. In the Felkins period o f government of the Stella Matutina, as reported by Ellic Howe and Arthur E. Waite, and sev eral others, an extraordinary degree of gullibility seemed to have taken possession of thes e visionaries who apparently had lost their wits and all sense of proportion and sanity primari ly because they did not use any or all of the protective devices in which the Order had already t rained them. This is one of the several reasons for my repeated insistence in several areas of this book for a complete mastery of the Pentagram and He xagram rituals in all their phases, with the"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 93 absolute memorization of the divine names, gestures , signs, etc. There should be no passing on to more advanced methods until the basic drills had been mastered. Otherwise the student who initiated himself, without the aid of a teacher other than this book of instructions, may find himself in a similar quandary as did Stein brecher and others. There is simply no justification or excuse for any of this at all. Pro per preparation is the basic rule for every phase of the magical arts. Without this, only disaster ca n loom ahead. While on this topic let me launch into a pet peeve of mine which is stimulated into activity every time I glance through some of the ma nuscript rituals dating from various periods in the history of the Order. Again and again I am s truck by sketches of Pentagrams, Hexagrams and grade signs to be made at various points of the ritual. I confess myself to be more than somewhat irritated by this procedure, since in theo ry it is not necessary. They are there included obviously to act as a reminder to the officer of te chnical matters which theoretically should have been mastered long before. Had they been mastered b eforehand, then there would have been no point in making these sketches of what he has to do . In one sense, this is the fault of the founders of the Order. Mathers himself has written a paper about the least amount of work needed to be d one to pass a written examination. This is a pretty poor notion to convey to newly admitted aspi rants to higher things. This was a curse that ran through all the Order work as I have indicated in What You Should Know About the Golden Dawn. Students for the most part did only so much as woul d get them through an examination. There was no thought of obtaining real proficiency in anything. Consecration ceremonies were done for the sword, the elemental weapons, the rose cross and so on, and there they stopped. It seemed never to have occurred to them to repeat the ir performance many times, over months or years if necessary in order to sharpen their expert ise. And yet practice for most of us is the only means whereby that expertise may be obtained. The Pentagram and Hexagram rituals should have been committed to memory long before some of these grade rituals were to have bee n performed. I am not antagonistic to the notion that the officers should refer to their scri pts for the long speeches required in some of the grade and other rituals, but I deem it unworthy of them -- if they are adepts in reality and not merely in name only -- if they must consult their m anuscripts in order to determine what kind of pentagram they were required to trace in some parti cular place, here, there or anywhere. The study of the Pentagram Ritual, for example, mus t not be confined merely to reading it over many times. It has to be performed again an d again until it becomes almost deeply embedded in the very warp and woof of one's unconsc ious. It has to be practiced until the Nephesch or automatic consciousness is able to repr oduce it without the Ruach giving the matter any deliberate thought. It seems to me to be a good idea for the student to prepare a simple type of ritual for daily use in which he will be required to employ al most everything he has learned concerning the art of invocation so that he will not need to t hink about it, but to devote his whole attention to the really significant parts of the ritual -- th e use of will and imagination and the vibratory formula of the middle pillar. Many years ago -- in the mid-thirties -- I construc ted a simple form of ritual for invoking"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 94 the elements. I borrowed the openings from each of the four elemental grade ceremonies and bound them together into a coherent whole. Then , for almost a whole year, I performed this little ritual daily, until I was able to describe a nd trace the appropriate lineal figures together with the appropriate divine names without a moment' s hesitation. It succeeded in driving these basic ritual methods deeply home into my unconsciou s psyche so that they were there when I needed them. Many years later, probably a couple of decades, whe n I returned to the simples and rudimentals again, I appropriated the opening phase of the Corpus Christi celebration which I called Opening by Watchtower. This becomes a magnif icent little ceremony and has become elaborated into a variety of different directions. Some of these have been described and written about at some length in Ceremonial Magic (Aquarian Press, England, 1980). It accomplishes in a slightly different manner what I had attempted to do much earlier, making use of every seemingly arbitrary gesture of elementary magic. It s practice is such that it should result in the ability to trace any pentagram or hexagram, invokin g or banishing, at will in the right place, etc. without having to burden one's script with a sketch of the appropriate pentagram. Actually, the ritual is very easy to learn and I strongly suggest it be committed to memory and performed as often as may be possible. In this manner, the basic principles of magical procedure are used so often that they become second nature. At the same t ime, the sphere of sensation is purified, exalted and made impenetrable to any outside and di sturbing influence. With such an aura, one can go anywhere, do anything, meet any entity witho ut fear or anxiety that one's person could be assailed successfully. After a year of study and the practice of the Opening by Watchtower, this magical result is achieved. When that stage ha s been reached, other usages of that ritual will suggest themselves. But the primary goal of this exhortation will have been accomplished. When performing a ritual -- any ritual, either by oneself or to dem onstrate a technique to a beginner -- one should not have to consult any text in order to recall wha t an invoking active spirit pentagram looks like, or from what point a banishing lunar hexagram should begin. This is fundamental magical training, must not be glossed over, and should be r espected as such for its disciplinary effect on the Nephesch and Ruach. To return however to the Inner Guide Meditation. In one place, the author gives a question asked by one of his students, as follows: \" I s the inner guide an aspect of my ego?\" His reply was no. The guides do not always cater to our ego whims and fancies. They say and do what is needed, not wanted. They know ou r limits and our inadequacies and allow exposure to unconscious materials which the ego wou ld never choose to deal with. This is all very well, and by and large I will acce pt this. But I did know sometime ago a lady who used this Inner Guide Meditation a very gr eat deal and let it govern her every day life and activity. It so happened that she was a compuls ive neurotic and a hypochondriac --the two often go together. Very often she would consult her inner guide as to some course of behavior, and of course he would advise her. As it turned out, he wa s a compulsive neurotic too, for he would advise her to behave in markedly compulsive routine s, ritualistically as it were. These she would accept"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 95 without equivocation -- naturally. It was her own v oice, as it were. The result was that her whole world fell apart disruptively and utter c haos ensued. I doubt if that taught her anything. She had given herself a crash course in magical procedures; she did have a copy of one o f my books. I doubt if she employed any of the testing d evices I have mentioned. That is the trouble with such crash courses; not enough of an impressio n is made on the unconscious psyche for the technique to be used when really necessary. The stupidity of the whole business is that it taug ht her nothing! Her compulsiveness remained, unaltered and unchanged! 3. Crowley's Body of Light Technique. Before going too far with a description of this met hod, let me give a long quotation from his Liber 0 , reprinted in Gems from the Equinox (Falcon Press, 1982). \" 1. This book is very easy to misunderstand; reade rs are asked to use the most minute critical care in the study of it, even as we have d one in the preparation. \" 2 . In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth, and the paths, of spirits and conjurations; of gods, spheres, planes, and many other things whi ch may or may not exist. \" I t is immaterial whether they exist or not. By doi ng certain things certain results follow; students are most earnestly warned against attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them... \"4. ................................................... ................................................... . The student, if he attains any success in the following practices, will find himself confronted by things (ideas or beings) too glorious or too dreadf ul to be described. It is essential that he remain the master of all that he beholds, hears or conceiv es; otherwise he will be the slave of illusion and the prey of madness... \"5. ................................................... ................................................... . There is little danger that any student, however idle or stu pid, will fail to get some result; but there is great danger that he will be led astray, even thoug h it be by those which it is necessary that he should attain. Too often, moreover, he mistaketh th e first resting-place for the goal, and taketh off his armour as if he were a victor ere the fight is well begun. \"It is desirable that the student should never atta ch to any result the importance which it at first seems to possess.\" Before proceeding further, let me state that all ot her things apart, Crowley was once a member of the Golden Dawn. All his early writings a re essentially expressive of the Golden Dawn viewpoint. It is only in his later writings th at he departs a considerable distance from the Order viewpont. But even then there always remains a nucleus of the Order teaching which he embraced with all his heart. No matter how far he d eparted from the basic Order methodology, he was a Golden Dawn initiate -- first, last and al ways. Let this always be remembered. In his writing, there is much of value to the sincere stud ent of these Golden Dawn techniques. \"1. ................................................... ................................................... . Let the student be at rest in one of his prescribed positio ns, having bathed and robed with the proper decorum. Let the place be free from all disturbance , and let the preliminary purifications, banishings and invocations be duly accomplished, an d, lastly, let the incense be kindled. \"2. Let him imagine his own figure (preferably robed in the proper magical garments, and armed with the proper magical weapons) as envel oping his physical body, or stand near to and in front of him."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 96 \"3. Let him then transfer the seat of his consciousn ess to that imagined figure; so that it may seem to him that he is seeing with its eyes, and hearing with its ears. \"This will usually be the great difficulty of the o peration. \"4. Let him then cause that imagined figure to rise in the air to a great height above the earth. \"5. Let him stop and look aboiut him. (It is sometim es difficult to open the eyes.) \"6. Probably he will see figures approaching him, or become conscious of a landscape. \"Let him speak to such figures, and insist upon bei ng answered, using the proper pentagrams and signs, as previously taught. \"7. Let him travel at will, either with or without g uidance from such figure or figures. \"8. Let him further employ such special invocations as will cause to appear the particular places he may wish to visit. \"9. Let him beware of the thousand subtle attacks an d deceptions that he will experience, carefully testing the truth of all with whom he speaks...\" At first sight this sounds a great deal different f rom the basic Golden Dawn method as described above. In point of fact, however, it is i dentical. Identical in spirit as well as in letter. For example, somewhere in his autobiography, Crowley sp eaks of instructing a student to visualize one of the hexagrams of the Yi King, and then to im agine that he is passing through it as if going through a door. A vision of some kind results from that, and when the student had returned from one of these, Crowley would open Legg e's book on the Yi King and read the description given of that hexagram. Usually there w ould be more than a marked relationship. Furthermore, in the Blue Equinox, at the end of the diary of Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones), Crowley under the pseudonym of Fr ater O.M. prescribes an examination for Achad. One of the items of that examination was to pass through a door on which was described a hexagram of a particular kind that Crowley had dr awn specifically for that purpose, and report what he had found out about that symbol by means of the vision. Do note that in both these instances, he mentions n othing of visualizing a body within his physical body or trying to transfer his conscio usness to it. In both instances he was literally following the Golden Dawn method of so-called Tattw a vision. Years ago, shortly after receiving my 5=6 degree, I painted on 3x5 filing cards a seri es of symbols -- those of the Tattwas, the Hebrew letters, the geomantic symbols, and the sign s of the planets and zodiac. These became the symbolic doors to use for skrying in the spirit vision, to use the technical name for the process being considered. One simply stared for a m inute or so at the card or the symbol on it, and then closed one's eyes -- in which case one saw the symbol in its complementary color. Then one imagined that this symbol grew in size unt il it was like a large door through which one could pass. Using the sign of the Enterer, one projected oneself through the door and on the other side vibrated the appropriate names and trace d the corresponding pentagrams and other lineal figures. A landscape was sure to develop, an d as a result of the invocations a figure would appear. If all went well, everything that he was in person and in color would be appropriate to that symbol. In any event he was to be tested by al l the tests at one ' s disposal to make sure that one was on the right track."},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 97 Crowley's Body of Light technique thus turns out in the end to be identical with that of the Golden Dawn. I could quote from Crowley's writi ngs to give examples of his skrying, but that is not really necessary at this juncture. The method is the same, and the testing techniques of course are the same. The document Liber 0 from which I quoted most of the ab ove instruction also describes the pentagram and hexagram rituals, as well as the vibr atory formula of the middle pillar and the assumption of god forms. All are taken, in their en tirety, from the Order of which he was once a member. All three methods -- that of the Order, Steinbreche r and Crowley -- are very similar, save only that Steinbrecher's method is lacking in the very protective devices that it so urgently needs. Apart from that, it may well be that his met hod is an ideal one for the beginner to use, even if only to acquire some expertise in the metho d. Once obtained, he should learn the Order's methods of testing and protecting -- and proceed fr om there."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 98 O N SK RYI NG By V.H .

Had I commenced at once with astral projection with out the introduction of my skrying experience, 1 should have had to evoke thes e figures.

After careful examination, by first receiving the i mpression and then testing it, I can describe the following. T he Angelic being, femi nine in nature, pale with brown hair and light grey-green eyes, is draped in blue and wh ite. She wears a crown formed of crescents. In her left hand she holds a curious cup, heavy, wi th a squarish base, and in her right hand a wa nd wit h a s ymb o l si mil ar to th e po siti ve ele me n t o f W ater . The Elementals vary in type, the majority being of the mermaid and merman nature, but a gai n ma n y are o f th e Ea rth a nd Air na tur e. Turning to the Angelic Being, I make the 5-6 Signs and LVX Signs, and to the Elementals the 3-8 and 1-10 Signs, and by right of these I ask to have explained some of the secret wor kin gs of th e pla ne o f t he c o mp oun d T a tt wa . T he Angel having answered my signs by similar ones gives the impression that she is willing to instruct me. T his can enter the mind as an extraneous thought, or may be heard clairaudiently. She shows how even the work o n this particular spot is varied and according to the types of the Elementals is the wor k allotted. Some Elementals such as gnomes are digging in the cliffs, with sharp instru ments, and boring holes therein, thus permitting water to enter freely. (This could expla in the spongy rather than broken appearance of the rocks.) The mermaid and merman El ementals, who I think are in the majority are carrying some dust into the sea. Some of this may go to form islands. Others are bringing earth and"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 103 weeds and alike from the depths, also probably to f orm land. There are also figures holding funnel-like cups who rise from the sea, drawing in air, diving back again carrying that element into the sea. It can be understood how these investigations can b e carried to very great detail, but to be as brief as possible I ask if I m ay be shown the effect of this Ray of the compound Tattwa on the Universe generally and o n this Planet in particular. I understand that the effect of the Ray is generati ng and fructifying generally, and on the whole beneficent, though everything woul d depend on the Force with which it was united. Its correlative would be thick rich water, containing such substances. I ask for its influence on Earth. I acc omplish this by shewing thought pictures of this planet and its continents, seas, e tc., and pray that this Angel will send a ray first to one spot and then another. In a nswer I perceive the ray falling right through the water of the Earth, as if the aff inity lay with all land under water. \"The Life of Earth in the Waters is its Name\" does the Angel say. Nearly all vegetation attracts this ray, but especially plants which grow under water. The Zoophyte only partially attracts it, this latter se eming rather largely composed of some active element, such as Fire. Among animals th e Ray appears to fall on the seal and hippopotamus, and has a general affinity f or most amphibious animals. With fish, the link seems to be small, a tortoise, a frog, and a snail are shown me, and some water-fowl of the duck variety. Falling on man, on the savage it would appear to be beneficial to health generally, to give a feeling of well-being, and wou ld also govern to some extent generation. Its tendency would be to accentuate sen suality and laziness. On the intellectual man it increases intuition, with some desire to clothe idea with form, therefore the first vague development of form in th e mind of the artist. Since this experience has become rather voluminous I will now stop - feeling that sufficient information has been expressed which can help guide the serious and enterprising student. I salute therefore the Angel with the LVX Signs and the Elementals by the 3-8 and 1-10 Signs, and banish astrally with the Pentag ram and other symbols that I have traced upon the scene. The more powerfully the symbols have been evoked, the more powerfully should they be banished. If you should be feeling a sensation of fatigue, as I before mentioned, make towards the symbols the sign of the Enterer indrawi ng their strength and vitality by using the sign of Harpocrates. Then return by th e way in which you came, that is through the symbol and back into your room. Once there perform the Supreme Banishing Ritual of the Pentagrams that you have ev oked. Supposing a scene to remain on the symbol of the Tattwa banish that as w ell. When you have had considerable practise it is probable that such deta iled care as is herein indicated will not be necessary. Should the operation be too complicated to accomplish at one sitting it would be possible to divide it into parts. However you will find that one carefully practised-sitting will provide more knowl edge and ability than a hundred careless and vague experiments which simply strengt hen mental deception, emotional folly and ignorance."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 104 NOTES This experiment is very good for the practice of Sp iritual sight, and in this manner you can easily prove the correctness of your vision .

If 5 persons are present form a pentagram, etc. The G.D. Altar, the most synthetical of the symbols , the material universe ruled by the Spirit and Four Elements. The Rose-Cross contai ns the affirmation of the principal divisions of the Universe, synthetical like the Alt ar, but particular in the sense that it is attributed to the Sephirah Tiphareth, the central S un, and is therefore the symbol for the Microcosm - Man, the Adept, he to whom perfection o f the Microcosm means a certain conscious union with the Macrocosm. T he white robe and yellow girdle imply Purity - Ket her, Harmony - Gold, Tiphareth. Lotus Wand - Mercy. Sword - Severity. Ima gination (eidolon) means the faculty of building an image. T he imagination of the artist must lie in the power which he possesses more or less in proportion to his sincerity, and his intuition, of perceiving forces in the Macrocosm, and allying or attuning himself thereto, his talents naturally and his trai ning permitting him to formulate images which shall express those forces. During this process, it is more than likely that yo u will be believing that the picture is one of memory, or imagination, or construction, etc . All these qualities being analogous to the faculty that you are employing, and the probabi lity of their arising at any moment will be great.

And, as if to illustrate this, there slowly emerged, shining s oftly through a transparent veil of greyish clouds, an opalescent orange globe, floating majest ically on the horizon. Rays of diffused light were playing around it, forming faint outline s of two enormous wings. No words could convey the supernal beauty, majesty and unutt erable sweetness of this apparition which seemed to be the very essence of love. The An gel and I were so overwhelmed that we silently knelt immersed in the soft radiance of thi s wondrous winged sphere. My senses began to reel, unable to withstand the impact of su ch a powerful and totally unfamiliar vibration, and as I was afraid to lose consciousnes s, nothing remained but to ask the Genie to conduct me back to my body. \""},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 109"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 110"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"VOLUME FIVE 111"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 1 VOLUME SIX OUTER ORDER RITUALS AND COMMENTARIES INTRODUCTION TO THE ORIGINAL GOLDEN DAWN RITUALS (These are not the later revisions of the Stella Ma tutina) In 1979 and 1980, my friend Carr P. Collins Jr. vis ited Gerald Yorke in England on two separate occasions to obtain copies of a Complete Set of Golden Dawn Documents. One set was lost in transit demanding therefore the second visit. They are dated 1894-5 and were originally issued to a member of the Order who used the pseudonym or magical motto of Frater De Profundis Ad Lucem. Upon examination of these papers I discovered that the later Rituals of the Stella Matutina had been considerably edited and modified when compared to the 1894-5 versions of D.P.A.L. In the Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic the original versions written by Mathers and Westcott have been used excl usively here. It was further discovered that there was a quantity of new material that either had never found its way to the Stella Matutina or had b een ruthlessly edited out. The result is that the contents of this book follow literally the titl e -- it does represent the Complete Golden Dawn System. Good fortune also pursued me in that R.A. Gilbert o f Bristol, the author of a biography of A.E. Waite now in preparation, and of a new history of the Golden Dawn from a radically different point of view, was kind enoug h to give me copies of the Neophyte and Adeptus Minor Rituals employed in Waite's own Order , The Fellowship of the Rosy Cross. This was formed some years after the revolt which s plintered and shattered the unity and integrity of the Order. Be that as it may, the student would do well to com pare the original simplicity of the Golden Dawn Rituals with the complex verbosity of Waite's Rituals.

The Double Cubical Altar in the center of the Hall, is an emblem of visible Nature or the Material Universe, concealing within herself the mysteries of all dimensions, while revealing her su rface to the exterior senses. It is a double cube b ecause, as the Emerald Tablet has said The things that are below are a reflection of the things that are above . The world of men and women created to unhappiness is a reflection of the World of Divine Beings created to Happiness. It is described in the SEPHER YETZIRAH, or The Book of Formation, as An Abyss of Height and as an Abyss of Depth, An Abyss of the Ea st and An Abyss of the West, An Abyss of the North and An Abyss of the South. The Altar is black because, unlike Divine Beings who unfold in the Element of Light, the Fires of Created Brings arise from Darkness and Obscurity. On the Altar is a Whi te Triangle to be the Image of that Immortal Light, th at Triune Light, which moved in Darkness and formed the World of Darkness and out of Darkness. There ar e two contending Forces and One always uniting them. And these Three have their Image in the three -fold Flame of our Being and in the threefold wave of the sensual world. Hiero: Stands in the form of Cross, saying: Hiero: Glory be to Thee, Father of the Undying. For Thy Gl ory Bows out rejoicing, to the ends of the Earth! Hiero: He reseats himself. Hiero: The Red Cross above the White Triangle, is an Image of Him Who was unfolded in the Light. At its East, South, West and North Angles are a Rose Fire, Cup o f Wine and Bread and Salt. These allude to the Four Elements, Air, Fire, Water, Earth. The Mystical Wor ds - KHABS AM PEKHT - are ancient Egyptian and are the origin of the Greek KONX OM PAX - which was uttered at the Eleusinian Mysteries. A literal translation would be Light Rushing Out in One Ray a nd they signify the same form of Light as that symbolized by the Staff of the Kerux. East of the D ouble Cubical Altar of created things, art the Pill ars of Hermes and of Solomon. On these are painted certain Hieroglyphics from the 17th and the 125th Chapters of the Book of the Dead. They are the symbols of th e two powers of Day and Night, Love and Hate, Work and Rest, the subtle force of the Lodestone and the Eternal out-pouring and in-pouring of the Heart of God. The Lamps that burn, though with a veiled ligh t, upon their summits show that the Pathway to Hidden Knowledge, unlike the Pathway of Nature - wh ich is a continual undulation, the winding hither and thither of the Serpent - is the straight and na rrow way between them.

Let me therefore advise yo u to remember this day as a marked one in your existence and to adopt and cultivate a mental condi tion worthy of this Order. To this end let me first earnestly recommend you never to forget due honor a nd reverence to the Lord of the Universe, for as th e whole is greater than its parts, so is He far great er than we, who are but as sparks derived from that unsupportable Light which is in Him. It is written that the borders of his Garment of Flame sweep the ends of the Universe and unto Him all return. There fore do we adore Him, therefore do we invoke Him; therefore in adoration to Him sinks even the Banner of the East. (Done)Secondly, let me advise you nev er to ridicule or cast obloquy upon the form of religi on professed by another, for what right have you to desecrate what is sacred in his eyes? Thirdly, neve r let the seal of secrecy regarding the Order be ab sent from your recollection, and beware that you betray it not by a casual or unthinking word. Fourthly, st udy well that Great Arcanum, the proper equilibrium of mercy and severity, for either unbalanced is not go od; unbalanced severity is cruelty and oppression; unba lanced mercy is but weakness and would permit evil to exist unchecked, thus making itself as it were t he accomplice of that evil. Lastly, do not be daunt ed by the difficulties of Occult Study and remember that every obstacle can at length be conquered by perseverance."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 20 Hiero: Before you can pass on to the next Higher Grade of this Order you will have to make yourself perfect i n the following: 1) The names and alchemical symbols of the four elements. 2) The names, astrological symbols and elemental attribution of the twelve sig ns of the Zodiac. 3) The names and astrological symbols of the seven planets, also their houses, ex altation and triplicity in the Zodiac. 4) The names , characters and numerical values of the twenty-two l etters of the Hebrew alphabet. 5) The names and English meanings of the ten Qabalistic Sephiroth.

FRATER A.M.A.G These three document, Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3, are amongs t the most important of all the instructions issued by the Golden Dawn. They are ex tensive commentaries on the Neophyte Ritual. All three are replete with the most profound instru ction on Magic ever written. As I reflect upon what I have written in this book I am sure that I have asserted several times that this particular document or that one are the m ost important lessons ever released within the Orde r. This is probably most correct. All the instructions handed out to the Zelator Adeptus Minor are unequivocally important in different ways. But they all serve as the foundation of the magical art. Throughout the years, whenever I have casually open ed the book to any page of these Z documents, I have found them always illuminating - more so with each perusal of their contents. Their ability to illuminate seems inexhaustable. And for this reason , I must insist that the student pay special attent ion to them, studying them carefully over a long period of time rather than trying to read them as he woul d a novel or some informative non-fictional piece of work. They have all the earmarks of having been written b y S.L. Mathers - G.H. Frater D. D.C.F. More than anything else I know, they exemplify the profundities of which he was capable. Admittedly some of the material is trite, elaborating the usua l claptrap of secret societies - such as grips, ste ps and passwords. But these trivia comprise but a small se gment of these fantastic papers. The remaining material is of such a nature that I feel compelled to warn the casual reader not to be casual in deali ng with this type of information. This is \"heavy\" mate rial which needs to be savored, thought about and reflected upon. For example, in the description of the accoutrement s of the Hierophant, one is inclined to gloss it over as merely explanatory of the Temple equipme nt. It is really much more than that. Some formulae of magic were concealed and simultaneously revealed in the most prosaic and trite explanations and descriptions. Do not gloss over th em. From the standpoint of practical magical technique, I suggest a frequent review of the segment entitled \"The Symbolism of the Opening.\" On e practical formula after another is described here, not abstractly but concretely as a technical exercise available to the alert and eager aspirant. Some of these served as seminal ideas which came to full term in the development of the Middle Pillar technique. The rudiments are all Gold en Dawn. But each rudiment is scattered here and there, throughout several documents. However, one d oes not really have to search too hard for them.

Francis King, in his book Ritual Magic in England reproduces a paper based on this section. It is most interesting, but raises an enormous number of questions relating to procedure, laboratory technique and allied topics. I had some corresponde nce with Mr. King about this matter but nothing came of it. Sometime during the mid-thirties some alchemical pr ocesses became more or less clear to me, which made more intelligible some of the sections i n Z-2. Years later, after a meeting with Frater Albertus of the Paracelsus Research Society, new in sights developed. A ritual exemplifying the rules laid down in Z-2 wi ll be found immediately following the various initiatory rituals. So far as rituals relating to evocation and similar types of operations are concerned some students found out that they are long, tedious, rep etitive and very wearying. I must confess they are. Success in working them depends on patience, enthus iasm, and above all on the ability to stir the magical energy into activity. The rituals themselve s will not yield much satisfaction until and unless the student has either some inborn theurgic ability or has developed it through the practice of the Middle Pillar technique. The method awakens the mag ical centers or chakras within the psycho- spiritual make-up of the student, a process of prim e importance, because without the power derived from these centers or chakras, the ritual remains m erely a ritual - a mere formality, dead and without power. The Middle Pillar should be practiced for se veral months, or even longer, until the student becomes thoroughly conscious of the energy coursing through the organism at his willed command in the three methods of circulation. The sensation is unmistakable, becoming wholly physical if steadfastly persisted in. It is the sine qua non of magical success. When some skill has been gained in this method, fur ther attention can be given to the Vibratory Formula of the Middle Pillar, described i n several places in this work. The success of any of these operations is wholly dependent on these tw o methods, the Middle Pillar and the Vibratory Formula, and they should be given a great deal of a ttention. When this material was first published many years a go, one of the gratifying rewards was hearing from a few students who evidently had exper imented with the method. One in particular stands out. I would have liked to acknowledge his c ontribution, but for the moment he wishes to remain anonymous. His letter gives evidence of the fact that he has experimented with the method and found it, for him, wanting, so that he felt obliged to clarify the procedure and simplify it. His complaint was that the whole ceremony took approxim ately two hours, at the end of which time he felt exhausted and was unable to retain any kind of \"divine intoxication\" which is the sine qua non of success. The method which he then devised is as fol lows: \"The magician, standing in the circle, performs a b anishing ritual. (For the evocation of an elemental, the lesser Pentagram ritual will suffice . If evoking a more powerful spirit, use the Suprem e Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, or Hexagram, as appropriate.)"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 28 \" A suitable God is invoked. Assumption of God form, Vibratory Formula of the Middle Pillar, and Mystic Circumambulation being employed. This is continued until presence of the Divine Force is unmistakable; one ought to have the impression of acting on behalf of the God. \"The Sigil of the Spirit is now consecrated and pla ced in the Triangle outside the Circle. The element, planetary, or zodiacal force consonant with the nature of the spirit is invoked using the proper Pentagram or Hexagram, Divine Names, etc . \"Invocation of the God is recommenced and continued until identity with the God is achieved. At this point the actual evocation may be gin. (The Magician will hereafter be referred to as the God.) \"The God extends His consciousness up to the spirit 's plane (not unlike skrying), formulates its sigil therein, calls its name. \"The Spirit is commanded to manifest in the Triangl e, and as the God brings his consciousness back into the body of the magician in the circle, the spirit manifests in the triangle. \"When he has sworn allegiance, and answered all que stions put to him, he is commanded to return to his own plane. The God again extends His consciousness up to the plane, bringing the spirit with Him. When they have both arrived, the S igil previously formulated is banished. \"He returns to the Circle, then partially withdraws from the magician, who again becomes aware that he is acting on behalf of the God. \"The element, planetary or zodiacal force previousl y invoked, is now banished. The magician then performs a general banishing ritual a nd quits the circle.\" The writer of the above method adds a note, which i n my opinion is worth paying close attention to; it coincides with my own view as expr essed elsewhere. \"There is reason for concern that some students may misinterpret certain of Crowley's magical writings. For example in Magick in Theory and Practice, Chapter IX, p. 69, he writes: `The peculiar mental excitement required may even b e aroused by the perception of the absurdity of the process, and the persistence in it , as when Frater Perdurabo...recited From Greenland's Icy Mountains and obtained his result.\"' \"Now there is no doubt that the ego, excited to the proper pitch, is capable of placing such a strain in the Astral Light as to cause some sort of manifestation, perhaps even that of the spirit i t was desired to evoke (but more likely a phantasm ma squerading as such). But without the presence of the Divine Force, such a being, once evoked, can not be controlled, and there is no effective means of banishing it. \"Depending on the nature of the spirit, and the deg ree of its manifestation, it is likely that the spiritual progress of the magician is at an end - at least as far as his current incarnation is concerned.\""},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 29 While on this topic of magical training and develop ing the powers latent in man, to which the Order is dedicated, I would like to quote extensively from another source.

It has often been asked, why, with all the resource s and wisdom of the Mahatmas, was H.P.B. left to struggle in poverty and illness? As we have seen, she was accused -though no individual ever c ame forward to complain - of getting rich on the credul ity of her followers. Suppose she had been richly maintained? Moncure Conway, the missionary, mention s her \"richly furnished\" apartment. No doubt the furniture had been expensive - before her wealt hy friends gave it to her when they got new stuff. She never starved for food, that is certain; she al ways did have enough - just enough - money - to do what she had to do. As to health - we can lay that in part to herself. She did break all the rules of diet, and possibly not all because of thyroid trouble and the rest; she was a hardheaded, intractable party. She knew all the rules. If she chose to break them, the Mahatmas couldn't do anything about it. Of course, they could have \"fired\" her, but then she was the o nly agent able to do what they had in mind. The queer thing about these questions is that they are often from Christians, whose own God left his only Son to live in hardship and poverty a nd die in horror. If you have to test out the morals of a tribe of sa vages, to see whether it is ready to haul its snout out of the mud and take the road to civilization, a good way is to drop a sick child of the same race but another tribe into the village compound.

He then places the Sigil between the Pi llars, himself at the East facing West, then in the Sign of the Enterer doth he direct the whole current of his will upon the Sigil. Thus he continueth until s uch time as he shall perceive his Will power to be weak ening, when he protects himself from the reflex of the current by the Sign of Silence, and drops his hands . He now looks towards the Quarter that the Spirit is to appear in, and he should now see the first signs of his visible manifestation. If he be not thus faint ly visible, let the Magician repeat the conjuration of the Superiors of the Spirit, from the place of the Throne in the East. And this conjuration may be repeated t hrice, each time ending with a new projection of Wi ll in the sign of the Enterer, etc. But if at the thir d time of repetition he appeareth not, then be it k nown that there is an error in the working. So let the Master of Evocations replace the Sigil upon the Altar, ho lding the Sword as usual. Thus doing, let him address a h umble prayer unto the Great Gods of Heaven to grant unto him the force necessary to correctly complete that evocation. He is then to take back the Sigil t o between the Pillars, and repeat the former processe s, when assuredly that Spirit will begin to manifes t, but in a misty and ill-defined form. (But if, as is pro bable, the Operator be naturally inclined unto evoc ation, then might that Spirit perchance manifest earlier i n the Ceremony than this. Still, the Ceremony is to be performed up to this point, whether he be there or no.) Now as soon as the Magician shall see the visi ble manifestation of that Spirit’s presence, he shall q uit the station of the Hierophant, and consecrate a fresh with Water and with Fire, the Sigil of the evoked s pirit.

T - The Magician, standing in the place of the Hier ophant, but turning towards the place of the Spirit and fixing his attention thereon, now reads a potent Invocation of the Spirit unto visible appe arance, having previously placed the sigil on the ground, w ithin the circle, at the quarter where the Spirit a ppears. This Invocation should be of some length; and shoul d rehearse and reiterate the divine and other Names consonant with the working. That Spirit should now become fully and clearly visible, and should be abl e to speak with a direct voice, if consonant with his nature. The Magician then proclaims aloud that the"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 37 Spirit (give name) hath been duly and properly evok ed in accordance with the sacred rites.

The Master of Evocat ions now addresses a Conjuration unto the Spirit evoked, binding him to hurt or injure naught connec ted with him, or his assistants, or the place. And that he deceive in nothing, and that he fail not to perf orm that which he hath been commanded. W - He then dismisses that Spirit by any suitable f orm, such as those used in the higher grades of the Outer. And if he will not go, then shall the Ma gician compel him by forces contrary to his nature. But he must allow a few minutes for the Spirit to demat erialise the body in which he hath manifested, for he will become less and less material by degrees. And note well that the Magician (or his companions if h e have any) shall never quit the circle during the pr ocess of evocation, or afterwards, till the Spirit hath quite vanished. In some cases, and with some consti tutions, there may be danger arising from the Astra l conditions, and currents established, and without t he actual intention of the Spirit to harm, although if of a low nature, he would probably endeavour to do so. T herefore, before the commencement of the Evocation, let the operator assure himself that eve rything which may be necessary, be properly arrange d within the circle. But if it be actually necessary to interrupt the Process, then let him stop at that point, veil and re-cord the Sigil if it have been unbound or uncovered, recite a License to Depart or a Banis hing Formula, and perform the Lesser Banishing Rituals b oth of the Pentagram and Hexagram.

P - The comparison of the first preliminary judgmen t with one second judgment developing therefrom, so as to enable the Diviner to form an i dea of the probable action of forces beyond the act ual plane, by the invocation of an angelic figure conso nant to the process. And in this matter take care n ot to mislead thy judgment through the action of thine ow n preconceived ideas; but only relying, after due tests, on the indication afforded thee by the angel ic form. And know, unless the form be of an angelic nature its indication will not be reliable, seeing, that if it be an elemental, it will be below the p lane desired. Q - The Diviner now completely and thoroughly formu lates his whole judgment as well for the immediate future as for the development thereof, ta king into account the knowledge and indications giv en him by the angelic form. R - Having this result before him, let the Diviner now formulate a fresh divinatiOn process, based on the conclusions at which he has arrived, so as t o form a basis for a further working.

H - The taking up of the residuum which remaineth a fter the distillation from the curcurbite or alembic; the grinding thereof to form a powder in a mortar. This powder is then to be placed again in the curcurbite. The fluid already distilled is to be po ured again upon it. The curcurbite or philosophic e gg is to be closed. I - The curcurbite or Egg Philosophic being hermeti cally sealed, the Alchemist announces aloud that all is prepared for the invocation of the forc es necessary to accomplish the work. The Matter is then to be placed upon an Altar with the elements and fo ur weapons thereon; upon the white triangle and upo n a flashing Tablet of a general nature, in harmony w ith the matter selected for the working.

Then let the Alchemist say: “So help me the Lord of the Universe and my own Hig her Soul.” Then let him raise the curcurbite in the air with both hands, saying: “Ari se herein to action, 0 ye forces of the Light Divin e.” K - Now let the matter putrefy in the Balneum Maria e in a very gentle heat, until darkness beginneth to supervene; and even until it becometh entirely black. If from its nature the mixture will not admit of entire blackness, examine it astrally till there is the astral appearance of the thickest pos sible darkness, and thou mayest also evoke an elemental"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 49 form to tell thee if the blackness be sufficient. B ut be thou sure that in this latter thou art not de ceived, seeing that the nature of such an elemental will be deceptive from the nature of the symbol of Darknes s, wherefore ask thou of him nothing further concernin g the working at this stage but only concerning the blackness, and this can be further tested by the el emental itself, which should be either black or cla d in an intensely black robe. In this evocation, use the na mes, etc., of Saturn. When the mixture be sufficien tly black, then take the curcurbite out of the Balneum Mariae and place it to the North of the Altar and perform over it a solemn invocation of the forces o f Saturn to act therein; holding the wand by the bl ack band, then say: “The voice of the Alchemist” etc. T he curcurbite is then to be unstopped and the Alemb ic Head fitted on for purposes of distillation. In all such invocations a flashing tablet should be used whereon to stand the curcurbite. Also certain of th e processes may take weeks, or even months to obtai n the necessary force, and this will depend on the Al chemist rather than on the matter. L - Then let the Alchemist distil with a gentle hea t until nothing remaineth to come over. Let him then take out the residuum and grind it into a powd er; replace this powder in the curcurbite, and pour again upon it the fluid previously distilled. The c urcurbite is then to be placed again in a Balneum M ariae in a gentle heat. When it seems fairly re-dissolved (irrespective of colour) let it be taken out of th e bath. It is now to undergo another magical ceremony. M - Now place the curcurbite to the West of the Alt ar, holding the Lotus Wand by the black end, perform a magical invocation of the Moon in her dec rease and of Cauda Draconis. The curcurbite is then to be exposed to the moonlight (she being in her de crease) for nine consecutive nights, commencing at full moon. The Alembic Head is then to be fitted on . N - Repeat process set forth in section L. O - The curcurbite is to be placed to the East of t he Altar, and the Alchemist performs an invocation of the Moon in her increase, and of Capu t Draconis (holding Lotus Wand by white end) to act upon the matter. The curcurbite is now to be expose d for nine consecutive nights (ending with the Full Moon) to the Moon’s rays. (In this, as in all simil ar exposures, it matters not if such night be overc iouded, so long as the vessel be placed in such a position as to receive the direct rays if the cloud withdraw .) P - The curcurbite is again to be placed on the whi te triangle upon the Altar. The Alchemist performs an invocation of the forces of the Sun to act in the curcurbite. It is then to be exposed to the rays of the sun for twelve hours each day; from 8:30 a.m . to 8:30 p.m. (This should be done preferably when the sun is strongly posited in the Zodiac, but it c an be done at some other times, though never when h e is in Scorpio, Libra, Capricornus, or Aquarius.)

The Alchemist repeats the words: “Child of Earth, long hast thou dwelt, e tc.” Then holding above it the"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 50 Lotus Wand by the white end, he say: “I formulate i n thee the invoked forces of Light,” and repeats th e mystic words. At this point keen and bright flashes of light shoula appear in the curcurbite, and the mixture itself (as far as its nature will permit) s hould be clear. Now invoke an Elemental from the curcurbite consonant to the Nature of the Mixture, and judge by the nature of the colour of its robes and their brilliancy whether the matter has attained to the right condition. But if the flashes do not app ear, and if the robes of the elemental be not brilliant and flashing, then let the curcurbite stand within the white triangle for seven days; having on the right hand o f the Apex of the triangle a flashing tablet of the Sun, and in the left one of the Moon. Let it not be move d or disturbed all those seven days; but not in the dark, save at night. Then let the operation as aforementi oned be repeated over the curcurbite, and this proc ess may be repeated altogether three times if the flash ing light cometh not. For without this latter the w ork would be useless. But if after three repetitions it still appear not, it is a sign that there hath bee n an error in the working, such being either in the disposition o f the Alchemist or in the management of the curcurb ite. Wherefore let the lunar and the solar invocations a nd exposures be repeated when without doubt, if the se be done with care (and more especially those of Cap ut Draconis and Cauda Draconis with those of the Moon as taught, for these have great force material ly) then without doubt shall that flashing light ma nifest itself in the curcurbite. R - Holding the Lotus Wand by the white end, the Al chemist now draws over the curcurbite the symbol of the Flaming Sword as if descending into t he mixture. Then let him place the curcurbite to th e East of the Altar. The Alchemist stands between the pillars, and performs a solemn invocation of the forces of Mars to act therein. The curcurbite is th en to be placed between the Pillars (or the drawn symbols of these same) for seven days, upon a flash ing tablet of Mars. After this period, fit on the Alembic Head, and distil first in Balneum Mariae, t hen in Balneum Arenae till such time as the mixture be all distilled over. S - Now let the Alchemist take the fluid of the dis tillate and let him perform over it an invocation of the forces of Mercury to act in the clear fluid, so as to formulate therein the aichemic Mercury, e ven the Mercury of the Philosophers. (The residuum or t he Dead Head is not to be worked with at present, b ut is to be set apart for future use.) After the invoc ation of the Aichemic Mercury a certain brilliance should manifest itself in the whole fluid, that is to say, it should not only be clear, but also brilliant an d flashing. Now expose it in an hermetic receiver for seven day s to the light of the Sun; at the end of which time there should be distinct flashes of light therein. (Or an egg philosophic may be used; but the receive r of the Alembic if close stopped will answer this purpo se.) T - Now the residuum or Dead Head is to be taken ou t of the curcurbite, ground small and replaced. An invocation of the Forces of Jupiter is then to be performed over that powder. It is then to be kept in the dark standing upon a flashing Tablet of Jupiter for seven days. At the end of this time th ere should be a slight flashing about it, but if this c ome not yet, repeat this operation up to three time s, when a faint flashing of Light is certain to come."},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 51 U - A flashing Tablet of each of the four Elements is now to be placed upon an altar as shown in the figure, and thereon are also to be placed the m agical elemental weapons, as is also clearly indica ted. The receiver containing the distillate is now to be placed between the Air and Water Tablets, and the curcurbite with the Dead Head between the Fire and Earth Tablets. Now let the Alchemist perform an invocation using especially the Supreme Ritual of t he Pentagram, with the lesser magical implement appropriate. First, of the forces of Fire to act in the curcurbite on the Dead Head. Second of those o f Water to act on the distillate. Third, of the force s of the Spirit to act in both (using the white end of Lotus Wand). Fourth, of those of the Air to act on the di stillate; and lastly, those of the Earth to act on the Dead Head.

This is the most important of all the Invocations. It will only succeed if the Alchemist keepeth himself closely allied unto his Higher Self during the working of the invocation and of making the Tablet. And at the end of it, if it have been successful, a keen and translucent flash will take the place of the slightly coloured flashes in the r eceiver of the curcurbite; so that the fluid should sparkle as a diamond, whilst the powder in the curcurbite shall slightly gleam."},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 52 W - The distilled liquid is now to be poured from t he receiver upon the residuum of the Dead Head in the curcurbite, and the mixture at first wi ll appear cloudy.

Even so, the Sacred Rites of the Temple may gradually, and as it were, in spite of himself, lead the Neophyte unto the knowledge of his Higher Self. Like the other Sephiroth, Malkuth hath also its subsidiary Sephiroth and Paths. Of th ese Ten Sephiroth, the Temple as arranged in the Neophy te Grade, includeth only the four lower Sephiroth i n the Tree of Life, viz: Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, and Net zach, and the Outer side of Paroketh, the Veil. Paroketh formeth the East of the Temple. First in i mportance cometh the symbolism of the East. The Three Chiefs who govern and rule all things, th e Viceroys in the Temple of the unknown Second Order beyond, are the reflections therein of the Powers of Chesed, Geburah and Tiphareth. They represent: the Imperator - Geburah and the Grade 6- 5: the Praemonstrator - Chesed and the Grade 7-4: t he Cancellarius - Tiphareth and the Grade 5-6. Now the Imperator governeth, because in Netzach, wh ich is the highest grade of the First Order, 4-7, is the Fire reflected from Geburah. The Praemo nstrator is Second, because in Hod, which is the ne xt highest Grade, 3-8, is the Water reflected from Che sed.

Thus the Order is governed by a Triad, one in intention but having different functions: the Imperator to comman d: the Praemonstrator to instruct: the Cancellarius to record. The proper mantle of Office of the Imperator is the flame scarlet Robe of Fire and Severity, as on him do the energy and stability of the Temple depen d: and if he has sub-Officers to assist him, they partake of his symbolism. His Mantle is the symbol of unflinching Authority, compelling the obedience of the Temple to all commands issued by the Second Order; and upon the left breast thereof, is the Cro ss and Triangle of the Golden Dawn, both white, repres enting the purification of the Temple in the Outer Order by Fire. He may wear a Lamen similar to that of Hierophant, of the same colours, but depending from a scarlet collar, and he may bear a Sword simi lar to that of Hiereus. His place in the Temple is at the extreme right of the Dais and at the Equinox he tak es the Throne of Hierophant when that Office is vacated.

He may wear a Lamen like that of Hierophant, but blue upon an orange field and depen ding from a collar of blue. He may bear a Sceptre surmounted by a Maltese Cross in the Elemental colo urs. The proper Mantle of Office of the Cancellarius is the yellow Robe of Air. Upon him depend the Records of the Temple, the order of its working, th e arrangements of its Meetings and the circulation of its manuscripts. He is the Recorder and, more immed iately than either of the preceding Chiefs, the Representative of the executive authority of the Se cond Order over the Outer. His duty is to see that in no case knowledge of a Grade be given to a Member who has not properly attained to it. He is the immediat e circulator of all communications from the Second Or der. His sub-officers partake of his symbolism. His White Cross and Triangle represent the purification of the Outer Order by Air. Cancellarius may wear a Lamen like that of Hierophant, but of yellow on a p urple field, and depending from a purple collar; an d he may bear a Sceptre surmounted by a Hexagram of ambe r and gold. The Sceptres of the Chiefs should be of the same co lour as their Mantles, with a gold band to represent Tiphareth, being the first Grade of the I nner Order. The Sword of the Imperator should have a plain scarlet hilt, with gold or brass mountings, w hile the Sceptre of the Praemonstrator should be bl ue with a gold band. The proper seat of the Chiefs is beside the Hierophant, and if desired the Imperator and Cancellarius may be seated to the right and Praemon strator and Immediate Past Hierophant to his left - - the Cancellarius and Immediate Past Hierophant bein g nearest to the Hierophant on their respective sid es. The Chiefs stand before the Veil in the East of the Temple, as the Representatives of the Inner Order and therefore no meeting can be held without one of the m. Preferably all Three Chiefs should be present. T he other Officers of the Temple exist only by their au thority and permission. Because the East of the Temple is the outer side of Paroketh, all Members of the Second Order wear the Crossed Sashes of a Lord of the Path s of the Portal of the Vault only -- no higher Grade being allowed to be shown in a Temple of the First Order. Members of the Second Order should be seated in the East of the Te mple when practicable. Any Past Hierophant may wear a Mantle of a Hierophant and a Jewel of that Lamen, but not a large Collar Lamen. Immediate Past Hierophant may have a Sceptre of a Hierophant. The Chiefs, or Members asked to represent them on t he Dais, wear white gowns.

The Black Sash cr osses from the left shoulder (from the side of the Black Pillar, as they first received it), and the White S ash from the Right shoulder.

Members may wear similar nemysses in black and white or plain black squares of approved pattern. The Key to the formation of the tunic and nemyss is the Crux Ansata for the nemyss makes the oval, and the arms and body of the tunic, the cross . THE SYMBOLISM OF THE TEMPLE The Bases of the two Pillars are respectively in Ne tzach and Hod; the White Pillar being in Netzach and the Black Pillar in Hod. They represent the Two Pillars of Mercy and Severity. The bases a re cubical and black to represent the Earth Element in Malkuth. The columns are respectively black and white to represent the manifestation of the Eternal Balance of the Scales of Justice. Upon them should be represented in counter-changed colour any appropria te Egyptian designs, emblematic of the Soul. The scarlet tetra-hedronal capitals represent the F ire of Test and Trial: and between the Pillars is the porchway of the Region Immeasurable. The twin l ights which burn on their summits are “The Declarers of the Eternal Truth.” The bases of the t etrahedra, being triangular, that on the White pill ar points East, while that on the Black points West. T hey thus complete the Hexagram of Tiphareth though separate, as is fitting in “The Hall of the Dual Ma nifestation of Truth.” The Altar, whose form is that of a double cube, is placed in the Eastern part of Malkuth, as far as the Neophyte is concerned. But to the Adeptus Minor , its blackness will veil on the East citrine, on t he South olive, on the North russet, while the West si de alone, and the base, will be black, while the su mmit is of a brilliant whiteness. The Symbols upon the Altar represent the Forces and Manifestation of the Divine Light, concentrated in the White Triangle of the Three Sup ernals as the synthesis; wherefore, upon this sacre d and sublime Symbol, is the obligation of the Neophy te taken as calling therein to witness the Forces o f the Divine Light. The Red Cross of Tiphareth (to which the Grade of 5 -6 is referred) is here placed above the White Triangle, not as dominating it, but as bringing it down and manifesting it unto the Outer Order; as th ough the Crucified One, having raised the symbol of self -sacrifice, had thus touched and brought into actio n in matter, the Divine Triad of Light. Around the Cross are the Symbols of the Four Letter s of the Name YHVH --the Shin of Yeheshuah being only implied and not expressed in t he Outer Order. At the East is the Mystical Rose, allied by its scent to the Element of Air. At the S outh is the Red Lamp, allied by its Flame with the Element of Fire.

THE STATIONS OF THE OFFICERS The Hierophant is placed in the East of the Temple, on the outer side of the Veil Paroketh, to rule the Temple under the Presidency o f the Chiefs. There he fills the place of a Lord of the Paths of the Portal of the Vault of the Adep ts, acting as Inductor to the Sacred Mysteries.

The Lamen suspended from a white Collar. The Crown headed Sceptre. The Banner of the East. The positio n of the Throne on the Path Samekh is fitting for t he Inductor to the Mysteries, as there being placed in that balanced and central position of that Path by which alone is safe entrance to the mystical knowledge of the Light in Tiphareth. Being placed before Paroke th at the point of its rending, it there marks the shi ning forth of the Light through the Veil; and that translation"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 58 of the Three Supernals to the Outer Order, which is represented by the red Calvary Cross and the White Triangle upon the Altar. Thus the station of Hierop hant’s Throne, fitly represents the Rising of the S un of Life and Light upon our Order. The Robe of scarlet represents the flaming energy o f the Divine Light, shining forth into infinite Worlds. Upon the left breast is a White Cross to re present purification unto the Light, and this Cross may be one of the following forms: The CALVARY CROSS alludes either to the cross of six squares of Tiphareth or to the Cross of the Rivers. The PYRAMIDAL CROSS of the Elements, to represent t he descent of the Divine and Angelic Forces into the pyramid symb ol. The EQUILATERAL CROSS of the Elements, symbolising their purification through the Light of the Four lettered Name YHVH in Tiphareth. The MALTESE CROSS of four arrowheads, representing the keen and swift impact of the Light, coming from behind the Veil, t hrough the Elements symbolised by the arrow of Sagittarius in the Path of Samekh. It is indifferent which of the Crosses be employed, seeing that each represents the operation of the Light through the Veil. The Sceptre represents the forces of the Middle Pil lar. It is scarlet with gold bands to represent the places of the Sephiroth Daath, Tiphareth and Ye sod, the pommel being Malkuth. The shaft represents the Paths Gimel, Samekh and Tau. The Grip by which it is wielded, is the path Tau, representing the Universe governed by and attracting the forces of t he Light. The Names of Sephiroth and Paths are not marked thereon, but the Hierophant Initiate of the Second Order should remember the sublimity of the symbolism while he wields it. It represents him as touching thereby the Divine Light of Kether and attracting it through the Middle Pillar to Malkuth. It is called “The Sceptre of Power” and invests hi m with the power of declaring the Temple Open or Clos ed in any Grade, if time be short, and this is done by saying: “By the power in me vested by this Sceptre, I declare this Temple duly opened (or closed).”"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 59 This method of Opening and Closing “by Sceptre” sho uld only be used in great emergency where time presses. It should not be used in a Ceremony w here Elemental Spirits have been invoked -- especially not in the Closing. The Lamen is partially explained in the Portal Cere mony thus: “The Hierophant’s Lamen is a synthesis Of Tiphareth, to which the Calvary cross of six squares, forming the cube opened out, is fit ly referred. The two colours, red and green, the most active and the most passive, whose conjuction point s out the practical application of the knowledge of e quilibrium, are symbolic of the reconciliation of t he celestial essences of Fire and Water. For the recon ciling yellow unites with blue in green, which is t he complementary colour to red, and with red in orange which is the complementary colour to blue. The small inner circle placed upon the Cross alludes to the Rose that is conjoined therewith in the symbol ism of the Rose and Cross of our Order.” But in addition to this, it represents the blazing light of the Fire of the Sun bringing into being th e green vegetation of the otherwise barren Earth. And also the power of self- sacrifice requisite in one who would essay to initiate into the Sacred Mysteries. So as the Sceptre represents the Authority and Powe r of the Light, the Lamen affirms the qualifications nec essary to him who wields it, and therefore is it suspended from a white collar, to represent the Pur ity of the White Brilliance from Kether. Hence it should always be worn by the Hierophant. The Banner of the East is also partially explained in the Portal: “The field of the Banner of the East is White, the colour of light and purity. As i n the previous case, the Calvary Cross of six squar es is the number of six of Tiphareth, the yellow Cross of Solar gold, and the cubical stone, bearing in its centre the sacred Tau of Life, and having bound together u pon it the form of the Macrocosmic Hexagram, the red triangle of Fire and the blue triangle of Water -- the Ruach Elohim and the Waters of Creation.” In addition to this explanation, it affirms the Mod e of Action employed by the Divine Light in its operation by the Forces of Nature. Upon it is the s ymbol of the Macrocosm so coloured as to affirm the action of the Fire of the Spirit through the Waters of Creation under the harmony of the Golden Cross of the Reconciler. Within the centre of the Hexagram i s a Tau cross in White, to represent its action as a Triad; and the whole is placed on a white field rep resenting the Ocean of the Am Soph Aour. The Banner is suspended from a gold colured bar by red cords, and the pole and base should be white. The base represents the purity of the foundation -- the shaf t, the Purified Will directed to the Higher. The go lden cross-bar is that whereon the Manifested Law of Per fection rests; the Banner itself, the Perfect Law o f the Universe, the red cords and tassels the Divine Self renunciation, whose trials and sufferings form, as it were, the Ornament of the Completed Work. The whole represents the ascent of the Initiate into Perfect Knowlege of the Light. Therefore in the address of the Hiereus the Neophyte hears “Even the Banner of the East sinks in Adoration before Him,” as though that symbol, great and potent though it be, were ye t but an inferior presentment of the Higher, fitted t o our comprehension. “Expounder of"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 60 the Sacred Mysteries” is the name of the Hierophant , and he is “Osiris” (Aeshoorist) in the Nether Wor ld. (The Coptic St added as a suffix to a name indicate s the influence from Kether.) The Station of Hiereus is at the extreme West of th e Temple and in the lowest point of Malkuth where he is enthroned in its darkest part, in the q uarter represented black in the Minutum Mundum Diagram. Representing a Terrible and Avenging God a t the Confines of Matter, at the borders of the Qlippoth he is enthroned upon Matter and robed in D arkness, and about his feet are Thunder and Lightning, the impact of the Paths of Shin and Qoph , Fire and Water, terminating respectively in the russet and olive quarters of Malkuth. There, theref ore, is he placed as a mighty and avenging Guardian to the Sacred Mysteries. The Symbols and Insignia of t he Hiereus are: The Throne of the West in the Black of Malkuth, where it borders on the Kingdom of Shel ls, The Black Robe of Darkness, bearing a white cross on the left breast; The Sword of Strength and Severity; The Lamen suspended from a Scarlet Colla r. The Banner of the West. The position of the Throne of the West at the limits of Malkuth is fitting for the Avenger of the Gods, for he is placed there in eter nal affirmation against the Evil Ones “Hitherto sha ll ye come and no further.” The Throne is also placed the re as a seat of witness and of punishment decreed against Evil. The Robe or Mantle is of Darkness, threatening and terrible to the Outer, as concealing an avenging Force ever ready to break forth against th e Evil Ones. On the left breast is a white Cross to represent the Purification of Matter unto the Light . The Sword represents the Forces of the Pillar of Severity as a whole, but the places of the Sephirot h are not necessarily indicated thereon. The guard is Hod and may be of brass; the Grip is the Path of Sh in and may be of scarlet, and the pommel, Malkuth, may be black. The grip by which it is wielded, bein g the Path Shin, represents the Universe governed b y the flaming force of Severity, and represents the H iereus as wielding the Forces of Divine Severity. “ The Sword of Vengeance” is its name. The Lamen is partially explained in the Portal thus : “The Outer Circle includes the four Sephiroth, Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod, of w hich the first three mark the angles of the triangl e inscribed within, while the connecting Paths Nun, A yin, and Peh form its sides. In the extreme centre is the Path Samekh through which is the passage for th e Rending of the Veil. It is therefore a fitting La men for Hiereus as representing the connecting link bet ween the First and Second Orders, while the white triangle established in the surrounding Darkness is circumscribed in its turn by the Circle of Light. In addition to this explanation, the Lamen represents “The Light that shineth in Darkness though the Darkness comprehendeth it not.” It affirms the poss ibility of the Redemption from Evil and even that o f Evil itself, through self-sacrifice. It is suspende d from a scarlet Collar as representing its depende nce on the Force of Divine Severity over-awing the evil. I t is a symbol of tremendous Strength and Fortitude, and is a synthesis of the Office of Hiereus as regards the Temple, as opposed to his Office as regards the outer world. For these reasons it should always be worn b y Hiereus."},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 61 The Banner of the West completes the symbols of Hie reus. It is thus explained in the Zelator Grade: “The White Triangle refers to the three Path s connecting Malkuth with the other Sephiroth; whil e the red cross is the Hidden Knowledge of the Divine Nature which is to be obtained through their aid. The Cross and Triangle together represent Life and Ligh t.” In addition to this explanation from the Zelato r Grade, it represents eternally the possibility of R escuing the Evil; but in it the Tiphareth cross is placed within the White Triangle of the Supernals as there by representing that Sacrifice is made only unto th e Higher. The red Cross may be bordered with gold in this instance, to represent the Perfect Metal obtai ned in and through the Darkness of Putrefaction. Black is its field which thus represents the Darkness and Ignorance of the Outer, while the White Triangle is again the Light which shineth in the Darkness but which is not comprehended thereby. Therefore is the Banner of the West the symbol of Twilight as it were, the equation of Light and Darkness. The pole and the base are black, to represent that even in t he Depths of Evil can that symbol stand. The cord is b lack, but the transverse bar and the lance-point ma y be golden or brass and the tassels scarlet as in the c ase of the Banner of the East, and for the same rea sons. The Banner of the West, when it changes its positio n in the Temple, represents that which bars and threatens, and demands fresh sacrifice ere the Path leading to the Higher be attained. “Avenger of the Gods” is the name of the Hiereus, a nd he is Horus in the Abode of Blindness unto, and Ignorance, of the Higher. Hoor is his nam e. The station of Hegemon is between the two Pillars w hose bases are in Netzach and Hod, at the intersection of the Paths Peh and Samekh, as it wer e at the Beam of the Balance, at the Equilibrium of the Scales of Justice; at the point of intersection of the Lowest Reciprocal Path with that of Samekh, whi ch forms a part of the Middle Pillar. She is placed th ere as the Guardian of the Threshold of Entrance an d the Preparer of the Way for the Enterer. Therefore the Reconciler between Light and Darkness, and the Mediator between the Stations of Hierophant and Hie reus. The Symbols and Insignia of Hegemon are: "},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 62 The Robe of Pure Whiteness, bearing on the left bre ast a Red Cross. The Mitre Headed Sceptre. The Lamen suspended from a Black Collar. The Robe represents the Spiritual Purity which is r equired in the Aspirant to the Mysteries and without which qualification none can pass between t he Eternal Pillars. It represents the Divine Light which is attracted thereby and brought to the aid o f the Candidate. It symbolises the Self-Sacrifice t hat is offered for another to aid him in the attainment of the Light. It also signifies the atonement of erro r, the Preparer of the Pathway unto the Divine. Upon the l eft Breast is a Cross, usually the Calvary form, of red to represent the energy of the lower Will, purified and subjected to that which is Higher and thus is the Office of Hegemon especially that of the Reconciler . The Mitre-headed Sceptre is the distinctive ensign of the Office of the Hegemon on the Tree of Life and represents the forces of the Pillar of Mer cy. It should be of scarlet with gold bands and pom mel. The bands represent the places of the Sephiroth Che sed and Netzach the shaft being formed by the Paths Vau and Kaph, the grip by which it is wielded being the Path Qoph, while the pommel is Malkuth. The Mitre is gold with red mountings and each point ter minates in a ball. The mitre is charged with a red calvary cross of six squares. This Mitre represents the Wisdom of Chokmah as a duplicated aspect of Kether, attracted by the symbol of self-sacrifice. The Sceptre is wielded by the forces of Flux and Re flux, shown by the grip being referred to the Path Qoph, and it represents the attraction into the Universe of the Forces of Divine Mercy. The Sephiroth and Paths are marked only as bands, and owing to its meaning, should be carried by Hegemon whenever conducting th e Candidate, as representing to the latter the attraction of the Forces of his Higher Self. It is called “The Sceptre of Wisdom.” The Lamen is explained in part in the Grade of Phil osophus thus: “The peculiar emblem of the Hegemon is the Calvary Cross of Six Squares within a Circle. This Cross embraces Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod and Yesod, a nd rests upon Malkuth. Also the Calvary Cross of Six Squares forms the cube and is thus referred to the Six Sephiroth of Microprosopus which are Chesed , Geburah, Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod and Yesod.” In addition to this explanation, it represents the black Calvary Cross of Suffering as the Initiator by Trial and Self-abnegation, and the Opener of the Way into the comprehension of the Forces of the Divine Light. It is therefore suspended from a blac k Collar to show that Suffering is the Purgation of Evil. “Before the Face of the Gods in the Place of the Th reshold” is the name of Hegemon, and she is the Goddess Thma-Ae-St having the following Coptic forms: Thma-Ae-St - this as regards the Middle Pillar and the influence from Kether. Thma-aesh - t his more fiery as regards her influence with respec t to the Pillar of Severity. Thmaa-ett - this more fluid ic with regard to her influence with respect to the Pillar of Mercy. She is the Wielder of the Sceptre of Dual Wisdom from Chokmah and therefore is the Mitre head split in two and not closed, to indicate the D ual Manifestation of Wisdom and Truth, even as the Hall of the Neophytes is called “the Hall of the Du al Manifestation of the Goddess of Truth.”"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 63 The Three Inferior Officers do not wear Mantles, bu t only Lamens suspended from black Collars. The designs are in white on a black field to show t hat they are Administrators of the Forces of Light acting through the Darkness, under the Presidency o f the Superior Officers. The Lamen of Kerux, is thus explained in the Grade of Theoricus: “The Tree of Life and the Three Mother Letters are the Keys wherewith to unlock the Caduceus of Hermes. The upper point of the Wand rests on Ket her and the Wings stretch out to Chokmah and Binah, thus comprehending the Three Supernal Sephir oth. The lower seven are embraced by the Serpents whose heads fall on Chesed and Geburah. They are th e twin Serpents of Egypt and the currents of Astral Light. Furthermore, the Wings and the top of the Wa nd form the letter Shin, the symbol of Fire; the Heads and upper halves of the Serpents form Aleph t he symbol of Air; while their tails enclose Mem, th e symbol of Water -the Fire of Life above, the Waters of Creation below, and the Air symbol vibrating between them.” In addition to this, the Caduceus of Kerux represen ts the balanced forces of Eternal Light working invisibly in the Darkness - even as the Light borne before the hoodwinked Candidate at his Initiation, is symbolic of the Light which guides him in the darkn ess of the world though he sees it not nor knows it . This Caduceus is the Rod of Hermes, containing invi sible and unsuspected forces, the rules of whose administration may be revealed through meditation. It is the outer form of the Wand surmounted by the Winged Globe below which the twin Serpents are show n - the Wand of the Chief Adept in the 5-6 Grade. The Lamen of Stolistes is thus explained in the Gra de of Practicus: “The Cup of Stolistes partakes in part of the symbolism of the Layer of Moses and the Sea of Solomon. On the Tree of Life it embraces nine of the Sephiroth exclusive of Kether. Yesod an d Malkuth form the triangle below, the former the apex, the latter the base. Like the Caduceus, it fu rther represents the three Elements of Water, Air, and Fire. The crescent is the Water which is above the Firmament; the circle is the Firmament, and the triangle is the consuming Fire below, which is oppo sed to the Celestial Fire symbolised by the upper p art of the Caduceus.”"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 64 In addition to this explanation, the Cup represents the Receptacle and Collector of the more Fluidic Forces of the Light, and is the symbol of a n inexhaustible Bowl of Libation from which Reservo ir the Adept may draw the Reserved Forces of the Light - which matter again calls for meditation. The Lamen of Dadouchos is thus explained in the Gra de of Zelator: “The Hermetic Cross, which is also known as Fylfot, Hammer of Thor, and Swasti ka, is formed of 17 squares taken from a square of 25 lesser squares. These 17 fitly represent the Sun , the Four Elements and the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac.” In addition to this, the Lamen has a more extended meaning. The Hermetic Cross, the Bolt of Whirling Flame, which is represented by the cross o f Four Axes whose heads may be either double or single and turned in either direction, is a symbol of terrific Strength, and represents the Fire of th e Spirit cleaving its way in all directions through the Dark ness of Matter. Therefore is it borne on the Lamen of Dadouchos whose office is that of Purification and Consecration by Fire, and from it also may be drawn by meditation several formulae of strength. The Kerux is the principal form of Anubis, as the S entinel is the subsidiary form. Kerux is Ano-Oobist Empe-Eeb-Te - “Anubis of the Ea st.” Sentinel is Ano-Oobi Em-Pemen-Te - “Anubis of the West.” The Kerux is the Herald, the Guardian and Watcher w ithin the Temple, as Sentinel is the Watcher without - and therefore is his charge the proper di sposition of the furniture and stations of the Temp le. He is also the Proclaimer. The Red Lamp to signify the Hidden Fire over which he watches. The Magic Staff of Power to represent a Ray of the Divine Light which kindles t he Hidden Fire. Two Potions whereby to produce the effect of Blood. He is the Guardian of the Inner side of the Portal - the sleepless Watcher of the Gods and"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 65 the Preparer of the Pathway to Divine Wisdom. “Watc her for the Gods” is the name of Kerux, and he is Ano-Oobist, the Herald before them. The Stolistes is stationed in the Northern Part of the Hall to the North-West of the Black Pillar whose base is in Hod, and is there as the Affirmer of the powers of Moisture, Water, reflected through the Tree into Hod. The Cup is the Receptacle of this, f illed from Hod so as to transmit its forces into Ma lkuth, restoring and purifying the vital forces therein by Cold and Moisture. “Goddess of the Scale of the Balance at the Black Pillar” is the name of Stolist es and she is “The Light Shining through the Waters upon Earth,” Aura-Mo-Ooth, and there is a connectio n between her and the Aurim or Urim of the Hebrews. The Dadouchos is stationed towards the midst of the Southern part of the Hall, to the South-West of the White Pillar whose base is in Netzach and is there as the Affirmer of the Powers of Fire, refle cted down the Tree to Netzach. The Censer is the Recepta cle thereof the transmitter of the Fires of Netzach to Malkuth, restoring and purifying the vital force th erein by Heat and Dryness. “Goddess of the Scale of the Balance at the White Pillar” is the name of Dadouch os and she is “Perfection through Fire manifesting on Earth,” Thaum-Aesch-Nia-eth. And there is a connect ion between her and the Thummim of the Hebrews. The Stolistes has the care of the Robes and Insigni a of the Temple as symbolising by their cleansing and purification the Purging away of the Evil of Malkuth by the Waters of the Spirit. The Dadouchos has charge of all lights, fires and i ncense, as representing the purifying and purging of Malkuth by Fire and the Light of the Spi rit. These Officers also purify the Temple, the Members and the Candidate by Water and by Fire, as it is written: “I indeed baptise you with Water, but One shall com e after me who shall baptise ye with the Holy Ghost and with Fire.” This completes the names and titles of the Officers of a Temple and they are Seven in number and may all be taken by a Frater or Soror. As they repr esent Powers and not persons, the feminine form of the Greek names is not usually used, for the powers are positive (male) or negative (female) according to the God-form used. Thus Hierophant, Hiereus, and Kerux are more natural offices for Fratres, while Hegemon, Stolistes and Dad ouchos are more natural for Sorores but the office itself carries no implication of sex and sometimes the psychic balanc e of a ceremony may be better maintained when a Frater is Hegemon and a Soror Hierophant. The Hierophant must be of the 5-6 Grade and a Zelat or Adeptus Minor. The Hiereus must be at least Philosophus, and the Hegemon at least Practic us, and preferably Philosophus. Kerux must be at le ast Theoricus while Stolistes and Dadouchos must be Zel ator, a Neophyte being qualified only for Sentinel. In case the feminine forms of the names of the Offi cers should wish to be known, they are as follows: V.H. Hierophant or V.H. Hierophantria H. Hiereus or H. Hiereia"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 66 H. Hegemon or H. Hegemone Kerux or Kerukaina Stolistes or Stolistria Dadouchos or Dadouche Sentinel or Phulax (N. B. These alternative or feminine forms were rar ely used in the early Order, and in the newly formed modern Temples will probably never be used. I.R.) OF THE THREE CHIEFS The Three Chiefs are in the Temple and rule it, yet they are not comprehended in, nor understood by, the Outer Order. They represent, as it were, Ve iled Divinities sending a form to sit before the Ve il Paroketh, and, like the Veils of isis and Nephthys, impenetrable save to the Initiate. The synthesis o f the Three Chiefs may be said to be in the form of Thoth Who cometh from behind the Veil at the point of it s Rending. Yet separately, they may be thus referred: The Imperator, from his relation to Geburah, may be referred to the Goddess Nephthys. The Praemonstrator, from his relation to Chesed, ma y be referred to the Goddess isis. The Cancellarius, from his property of Recorder, ma y be referred to the God Thoth. No ceremony of the Outer Order may take place witho ut a Chief, preferably the Three Chiefs or their Vice-gerants, present and on account of the S tations on the Dais, it is well to have these stati ons filled by an Adept, should a Chief be absent. These Stations and those of the Officers are called the Visible Stations of the Gods, and descriptions of t he forms which an Adept Officer builds up as a focu s of force are given in another paper. THE INVISIBLE STATIONS These are: 1. The Stations of the Kerubim. 2. The Stations of the Children of Horus. 3. The Stations of the Evil One. 4. The Station of Harpocrates. 5. The Stations of Isis, Nephthys, Aroueris. First, the Kerubim: (These are shown in the colour plate section of this book.) The Stations of the Man, the Lion, the Bull, and the Eagle are at the F our Cardinal Points without the Hall, as invisible Guardians of the limits of the Temple. They are pla ced according to the winds - beyond the Stations of Hierophant, Dadouchos, Hiereus, and Stolistes - and in this order do their symbols appear in all Warra nts of Temples.

She has a young girl’s"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 67 countenance and form, with large and shadowing wing s; and she is a power of the Great Goddess Hathor who unites the powers of Isis and Nephthys. To the Sign Aquarius is she referred as a correlative, whi ch represents Springs of Water breaking upOn Earth; th ough as a Zodiacal Sign it is referred to Air, the container of Rain. The Egyptian name of the sign Aq uarius is Phritithi. “Thou shalt not confound the Kerubim with their Signs of the Zodiac, notwithstan ding that the latter be under the Presidency of the former, seeing that the Kerub representeth a far mo re Sublime Potency, yet acting by a harmonious sympathy through the particular Sign allotted unto their correspondence.” The Kerub of Fire has the face and form of a Lion w ith large and clashing wings. He formulates behind the Throne of Dadouchos and he is a power of the Great Goddess Tharpesh or Tharpheshest, the latter syllable being nearly Pasht. The action of t he Lion Kerub is through the Flaming Fire of Leo of which the Egyptian name is Labo-Ae. The Kerub of Water has the face and form of a Great Eagle with large and glistening wings and he formulates behind the throne of Hiereus. He is a power of the Great God Thoomoo (TMU), and his operation is by the Sign of Scorpio, which is calle d in Egyptian Szlae-Ee. The Kerub of Earth has a face and form of a Bull wi th heavy and darkening wings. He formulates behind the Throne of Stolistes and he is a power of the Great God Aphapshi and his operation is by the Sign Taurus called Ta-Aur in Egyptian. Second, the Children of Horus: Between the Invisibl e Stations of the Kerubim are those of the Four Vice-gerants of the Elements and they are situ ated at the Four Corners of the Temple, at the plac es marked by the Four Rivers of Eden in the Warrant. T he body of a Warrant, authorising the formation and establishment of a Temple, represents the Temple it self - of which the Guardians are the Kerubim and t he Vice-gerents in the places of the Rivers. Ameshet (man-headed) is placed in the North East, b etween the Man and the Bull. Ameshet or Amesheth.

This station is in the place of Yesod and is called the Station of the Evil One, the slayer of Osiris. He is the Tempt er, Accuser and Punisher of the Brethren, and in Eg ypt is represented mostly with the head of a Water-Drag on, the body of a Lion or Leopard, and the hind-par ts of a Water-horse. He is the Administrator of the po wer of the Evil Triad:"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 68 The Stooping Dragon, Apophrassz. The Slayer of Osir is - Szathan Typhon. The brutal power of Demonic Force - Bessz. The Synthesis of this Evil Triad “The Mouth of the Power of Destruction” is called Ommoo- Szathan. Fourth, the Station of Harpocrates. The invisible S tation of Harpocrates is in the Path of Samekh, between the Station of Hegemon and the Invisible St ation of the Evil Triad. Harpocrates is the God of Silence and Mystery, whose Name is the Word of this Grade of Neophyte. He is the younger brother of Horus, Hoor-Po-Krattist. Fifth, the Stations of isis and Nephythys. The Stat ions of isis and Nephthys are respectively at the Places of the Pillars in Netzach and Hod, and these Great Goddesses are not otherwise shown in the Grade, save in connection with the Praemonstrator a nd Imperator, as operating through the Hierophant, seeing that isis corresponds to the Pillar of Mercy and Nephthys to that of Severity; and therefore th e positions of the Pillars or Obelisks are but, as it were, the Places of their feet. The Station of Aroueris. The invisible Station of A roueris(Horus the Elder) is beside the Hierophant as though representing the power of Osir is to the Outer Order - for while the Hierophant is an Adeptus, he is shown only as Lord of the Paths of t he Portal - so that, when the Hierophant moves from the Throne of the East, he is no longer Osiris but Aroueris. Yet when the Hierophant is on the Dais, t he Station of Aroueris is that of the Immediate Past H ierophant who sits on the Hierophant’s left. Aroo- ouerist. This ends the Constitutory Symbolism of a Temple in the Grade of Neophyte. Should a Member have occasion to quit his place, he shall do it mov ing with the course of the Sun. As he passes the pl ace of Hierophant, he shall salUte with the Sign. And when he enters or quits the Temple, he shall salute the Hierophant’s Throne when within the Portal. THE SYMBOLISM OF THE OPENING OF THE GRADE OF NEOPHY TE The Opening Ceremony begins with the Cry of the “Wa tcher Within” who should come to the right front of Hierophant and raise his Wand. This Symbol of the Ray of the Divine Light from the Whit e Triangle of the Three Supernals thus descends into the Darkness and warns the Evil and uninitiated to retire, so that the White Triangle may be formulate d upon the Altar through the combined effect of the formulae of the Opening Ceremony. Having done this, he sees that the Entrance is prop erly guarded. And then the Hierophant calls to the Hiereus to test the Members by the Signs, the k nowledge of which shows that they, though in the Land of Blindness and Ignorance, have yet seen that Triangle of Divine Light from the Three Supernals formulated in Darkness. It is then noted that the n ames of the three chief Officers begin with the Let ter of Breath in the Coptic. In the name of Osiris this letter is mute, and sile nt and Concealed, as it were, by ‘H’ the Eta. In the name Horus, it is manifest and violently aspira ted, while in the name Thmaest, it is partly one an d partly the other, for it is compounded with the Let ter ‘T’ in Theta."},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 69 H “Ae” is attributed to Chesed - to Aries, and to E arth and Saturn. This is intended to affirm the Unknown Life, which is Inspired from the Beyond, se nt out to Aries, the commencement of the Spring in the year, the Life which after being Inspired, is b reathed forth again; and also the possible use of t hat Breath, between the Inspiration and the Expiration, in the combination between it and the Forces of th e Microcosm. The whole is a rehearsal of the properties of the r eflection of the element Air down through the Middle Pillar of the Sephiroth, representing the re flection of the Air from Kether, through Tiphareth to Yesod, and even to the Citrine part of Malkuth. For the subtle Aether is, in Kether, inspired from the Divine Light beyond; hence reflected into Tiphareth , wherein it is combined with the Reflexes from the Aichemical Principles in that great Receptacle of t he Forces of the Tree, in Yesod. It affirms the foundation of a formula and from Malkuth it is brea thed forth or reflected back. And this formula the Adept can use. Standing in his Sphere of Sensation he can, by his knowledge of the Sacred Rites, raise himself unto t he contemplation of Yechidah and from thence aspire (in the sense of Adspire, i.e., to attract towards you in breathing) downwards into himself the Lower Genius as though temporarily to inhabit himself as its Temple. Another formula of Vibration is here hidden. Let th e Adept, standing upright, his arms stretched out in the form of a Calvary Cross, vibrate a Divin e Name, bringing with the formulation thereof a dee p inspiration into his lungs. Let him retain the brea th, mentally pronouncing the Name in his Heart, so as to combine it with the forces he desires to awake ther eby. Then sending it downwards through his body pas t Yesod, but not resting there, but taking his physic al life for a material basis, send it on into his f eet. There he shall again momentarily formulate the Name. Then , bringing it rushing upwards into the lungs, thenc e shall he breathe it forth strongly, while vibrating that Divine Name. He will send his breath steadily forward into the Universe so as to awaken the corre sponding forces of the Name in the Outer World. Standing with arms out in the form of a cross, when the breath has been imaginatively sent to the feet and back, bring the arms forward in “The Sign of the En terer” while vibrating the Name out into the Univer se. On completing this, make the “Sign of Silence” and remain still, contemplating the Force you have invoked. This is the secret traditional mode of pronouncing the Divine Names by vibration, but let the Adept beware that he applies it only to the Divine Names of the Gods. If he does this thing ignorantly in working with Elemental or Demonic Names, he may bri ng into himself terrible forces of Evil and Obsession. The Method described is called “The Vibr atory Formula of the Middle Pillar.” After noting the Names of the Three Chief Officers, comes the recapitulation of the Stations and duties of the Officers, thus occultly affirming the establishment of the Temple so that the Divine Lig ht may shine into the Darkness. Then follows the purif ication and consecration of the Hall by Water and b y Fire, thus marking the limitation of the Four Cardi nal Points at the Four Quarters, and the Equilibria tion of the Elements. This is the"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 70 Baptism of the Place and, as it were, the Preparati on of a fitting Shrine for the Forces of the Divine Light. While all this goes forward, especially after the H ierophant’s “for by Names and Images are all powers awakened and re-awakened,” the Officers become clot hed in their God-forms and the Invisible Stations awake. The Procession of Officers is then formed in the No rth in readiness for the “Mystic Circumambulation in the Path of Light” (that is to say, none of the partakers is hoodwinked). It is fo rmed in the North, beginning from the Station of Stolist es, the symbol of the Waters of Creation attracting the Divine Spirit, and therefore alluding to the Creati on of the World by the Spirit and the Waters. The Mystic Reverse Circumambulation forms its Processio n in the South, beginning from the Station of Dadouchos, as symbolic of the Ending and Judgment o f the World by Fire. But also, the Mystic Circumambulation commences by the Paths of Shin and Resh, as though bringing into action the Solar Fire; while the Reverse Circumambulation commences beside those of Qoph and Tzaddi as though bringing the Watery Reflux into action. The Order of the Mystic Circumambulation. First com es Anubis, the Watcher within; next Thmaest, the Goddess of the Hall of Truth; then Hor us; then the Goddesses of the Scales of the Balance , then Members, if the Hall be large enough, and at t he end the Watcher Without, Sentinel. It is as thou gh a gigantic Wheel were revolving, as it is said: “One Wheel upon Earth beside the Kerub.” The Name o f the Sphere of the Primum Mobile, Rashith ha-Gilgalim, signifies the heads or beginni ngs of Whirling Motions or Revolutions. Of this Wheel in the Mystic Circumambulation, the ascending side begins from below the Pillar of Nephthys, and the descending side from below the Pillar of Isis; but in the Reverse Circumambulation, the contrary. Now the nave or axis of this Wheel is about the Inv isible Station of Harpocrates - as though that God, in the Sign of Silence were there placed affir ming the Concealment of that Central Axis of the Wheel, which alone revolves not. The Mystic Circumambulation is called symbolic of t he Rise of Light and from it is drawn another formula for the circulation of the breath. It is the formula of the Four Revolutions of the Br eath (not, of course, of the actual air inspired, but of the subtle Aethers which may be drawn thence and o f which it is the Vehicle - the aethers which awaken centres in the subtle body through the formula). Th is formula should be preceded by that of the Middle Pi llar, described previously. By this method, having invoked the Power you wish t o awaken in yourself, and contemplated it, begin its circumambulation thus: Fill the lungs and imagine the Name vibrating in the contained Air. Imagine this vibration going down the left leg to t he sole of the left foot - thence passing over to t he sole of the right foot - up the right leg to the lungs a gain, whence it is out-breathed. Do this four times to the rhythm of the Four-fold breath. The object of the Mystic Circumambulation is to att ract and make the connection betwen the Divine Light above and the Temple. Therefore the Hi erophant does not quit his post to take part therei n, but remains there to attract by his Sceptre the Lig ht from beyond"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 71 the Veil. Each member in passing gives the Sign of the Enterer, thus projecting the Light forward on h is Path from East to West, as he receives it from the Hierophant’s Throne. Horus passes only once, for he is the Son of Osiris and inherits the Light by birthri ght from him. Therefore he goes at once to his stat ion to fix the Light there. Thmaest, the Goddess of Truth, passes twice because her rule is of the Balance of the Two Scales, and she retires to her Station between the Pillars there to complete the reflex of the Mid dle Column. The Watcher within and the rest circumambul ate thrice as affirming the completion of the Reflection of the Perfecting of the White Triangle of the Three Supernals upon the Altar. Then follows the Adoration of God the Vast One, the Lord of the Universe - at which again all give the Sign of the Enterer, the Sign of the Projection of the Force of the Light. Then only does the Watcher declare that the Sun has arisen and that the Light shineth in Darkness. Now comes the Battery of the Neophyte Grade - the single knock of Hierophant rep eated by Hiereus and Hegemon. This affirms the establishment of the White Triangle and therefore t he Completion of the Opening Ceremony. The Mystic Words “Khabs Am Pekht” which accompany the knocks s eal the image of the Light. Their significance imples, by various Qabalistic methods of analysis, as well as by a certain reading of the Coptic and Egyptian hieroglyphics, “Light in Extension” or “Ma y Light be extended in Abundance upon you.” Konx Om Pax is the Greek corrupted pronunciation of this, put here to link it with its right origin. The Grade of Neophyte has 0 or the Circle for its N umber, as if hiding all things under the negative symbol. This is placed within a circle and a square connected by equal lines, as if affirming the hidd en quality of their origin in Kether where all things are One, and the consequent universal application o f the Secret Formulae. "},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 72"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 73 Z-3 THE SYMBOLISM OF THE ADMISSION OF THE CANDIDATE ADMISSION OF THE CANDIDATE The Candidate is waiting without the Portal under t he care of the Sentinel - “The Watcher Without”. That is, under the care of the form of An ubis of the West, symbolically that he may keep off the “Dog-Faced Demons,” the opposers of Anubis, who rise from the confines where matter ends, to deceive and drag down the Soul. The Ritual of the 3 1st Path says: “Since ever dragging down the Soul and leading it from sacred things, from the confine s of matter arise the terrible Dog-Faced Demons nev er showing a true image unto mortal gaze.” The Hierophant gives a single knock to announcethe just commencement of a vibration in the Sphere of Sensation of the Candidate. He then state s that he holds the Dispensation from the G.H. Chie fs of the Second Order, to affirm that the effect of t he ensuing Ceremony upon the Candidate is duly authorised by the Higher Powers for the purpose of Initiation which shall ultimately lead to the knowledge of his Higher Self. He is admitted to the Grade of Neophyte which has no number, concealing the commencement of all things under the similitude of no thing. The Hegemon, the representative of the Goddess of T ruth and Justice, is consequently sent to superintend the preparation of the Candidate, thus symbolising that she is the Presider of Equilibrium to administrate the process of Initiation, by the comm encement of the forces of equilibrium in the Candid ate himself, through the symbols of rectitude and self- control. But the actual preparation of the Candidat e should be performed by the Sentinel - the “Watcher Without” - to show that this preparation must be accomplished before the establishment of equilibriu m can occur. Therefore, does the Hegemon superintend the preparation rather than perform it actually. A triple cord is bound round the body of the Neophyte, symbolising the binding and restriction o f the lower nature. It is triple in reference to th e White Triangle of the Three Supernals. Then, also, are th e eyes bandaged to symbolise that the light of the material world is but darkness and illusion compare d with the radiance of the Divine Light. The preparation also represents a certain temporary bin ding and restriction of the natural body. The Hierophant, being a Member of the Second Order and therefore initiated into the Secret Knowledge of the symbolism, shall, together with an y Officers and Members also of the Inner Order, remember what tremendous Gods and Goddesses they re present - the Divine Forces of the Eternal in the administration of the Universe. The Ritual should b e read in a loud, clear, stern and solemn voice so as to impress the Candidate with the solemnity of the occ asion. In this, there should be no foolish nervousn ess or hesitation, but the Ritual as performed by an in itiated Hierophant should become in his hands something more than this."},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 74 Thus should he act. Let him remember what particula r God he represents. Exalting his mind unto the contemplation thereof, let him think of himself as a vast figure, standing or moving in the likene ss of that God, colossal, his head lost in the clouds, wi th the light flashing round it from the head-dress of the God - his feet resting upon Earth in darkness, thun der and rolling clouds, and his form wrapped in fla shes of lightning - the while vibrating the Name of the God. Thus standing, let him endeavour to hear the v oice of the God whom he represents and of the God-Forms of the other officers as previously explained. Let him speak, then, not as if unto an assembly of mortals but as to an assembly of Gods. Let his voice be so directed as to roll through the Universe to the utmost confines of space. Let the Candidate represent unto him, as it were, a world whom he is beginning to lead unto the knowledge of its governing Angel. As it is writ ten “The lightning lighteneth out of the East and shineth even unto the West, even so, shall the coming of the Son of Man be.” The Candidate during the Ceremony is addressed as C hild of Earth, as representing the earthly or terrestrial nature of man - he who comes forward fr om the darkness of Malkuth to endeavour to regain t he knowledge of the Light. This is what is meant by th e speech of the Hegemon, because the Path of the Initiate is but darkness and foolishness to the nat ural man. The single knock given by the Hegemon without the door represents the consenting will of the natural man to receive the force formulated by the Hierophant, and is answered by the Kerux within as if a witness were confirming the same. This being done, the Kerux, as a witness, demands authority fr om the Hierophant to admit the Candidate into the Hall of Truth and Justice. The Hierophant, in grant ing the permission, seals the Candidate with a new name given to the physical body of the outward man, but signifying the aspirations of his Soul. As a consequence of the affirmation of the Motto as the Name of the Candidate in the Hall of Truth, Osiris at once sends forward the Goddess of the Scales of the Balance to baptise him with Water and the companion Goddess to consecrate him with Fire. As i t is written “Unless a man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he shall in no wise enter the Kingdom o f Heaven.” The Kerux instantly bars the Candidate’s passage to mark that though he has been admitted, the natural man of unpurified desires cannot be a dwell er in the Hall of Truth. The Goddesses of the Scale s immediately purify and consecrate him, which operat ion calls into action the forces of the Pillars in his own sphere of sensation. This is the first of four consecrations because when the Pillars of the Tree are projected onto the Sphere of Sensation there are fo ur pillars, of which the Middle Pillar is the axis. (N.B. There is a painting depicting this idea in the sect ion of coloured plates. I.R.) At this point of the Ceremony, the astral appearanc e of the Candidate is that of a form wrapped in darkness as if extinguished thereby, and having unt o his right and unto his left the faint semblance o f the Two Great Pillars of Fire and of Cloud, whence issu e faint rays into the Darkness which covers him. Immediately above his Sphere of Sensation there wil l appear a ray of bright light as if preparing to penetrate the darkness covering him. The"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 75 result of this will be that the Candidate, during t he whole of the ceremony of Admission, will usually appear to be somewhat automatic and vague. The reception and consecration take place symbolica lly in the darkest part of Malkuth. The moment this is finished, the Candidate is conducted to the foot of the Altar, that is under the citrin e part of Malkuth which receives the impact of the Middle Pil lar. Now, the Hegemon throughout the Ceremony acts as guide, prompter and answerer for the Candid ate. His office toward the Candidate is analogous t o that of his Higher Soul wherefore also, the Hegemon holds in his hand the mitre-headed sceptre to attr act, since it is the sceptre of Wisdom, the Higher Self of the Candidate. At this moment, as the Candidate stands before the Altar, as the simulacrum of the Higher Self is attracted, so also arises the form of the Accuser i n the place of the Evil Triad. This similarly attra cts the simulacrum of the Evil Persona of the Candidate - a nd were it not for the power of the 42 lettered nam e in the Palaces of Yetzirah (the Gods of which name are usually called the “Great Assessors of Judgment”) the actual evil Persona would at once formulate and be able to obsess the Ruach of the Candidate. For, seeing that at this time, the simulacrum of the Hig her Soul is attracting the Neschamah of the Candida te, the human will is not as powerful in the Ruach for the moment, because the Aspirant of the Mysteries i s now, as it were, divided. That is, his Neschamah is directed to the contemplation of his Higher Self attracted by the Hegemon. His natural body is bound and blinded, his Ruach threatened by the simulacrum of the Evil Persona attracted by OmooSza than, and a species of shadow of himself thrown forward to the place of the Pillars, where the Scal es of Judgment are set. At the same time that the f irst consecration establishes a semblance of the Pillars to his right and left, it also has drawn forth fro m him a semblance of himself to the place vacated by the He gemon between the Pillars. Here then stands the shadow of the Candidate while the Scales of the Balance oscillate unseen. Unseen also and colossal, there is imaged before hi m Thoth, as Metatron, in the Sign of the Enterer of the Threshold, ready, according to the decision of the human will, to permit or withhold the descent of th e Lower Genius of the Candidate. Meanwhile, the Great Assessors of Judgment examine into the truth of the accusations formulated by the Evil and averse a ntithesis. The Assessors of Judgment come not under the head of invisible stations, but during the Obli gation and circumambulation of the Candidate, until he is brought to the Light, they hover immediately abo ut the limits of the Temple and their evil antithes is immediately below. Therefore, when the Candidate st ands before the Altar before the Obligation, is the decision actually taken by the human will of the Ca ndidate. Rarely in his life has he been nearer deat h, seeing that he is, as it were, disintegrated into h is component parts. The process of symbolic judgmen t takes place during the speech of the Hierophant to the Candidate, the answer of the Hegemon and his consent to take the Obligation. The moment the Candidate thus consents, the Hieroph ant advances between the Pillars as if to assert that the Judgment is concluded. He advances by the invisible station of"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 76 Harpocrates to that of the Evil Triad, which he sym bolically treads down, so that as Aroueris he stand s upon the Opposer. He then comes to the East of the Altar, interposing between the place of the Evil Tr iad and the Candidate. At the same time, the Hiereus ad vances on the Candidate’s left, the Hegemon on his right, thus formulating about him the symbol of the Higher Triad before he places his hand upon the symbol of the Three Supernals upon the Altar. Again , before doing so, he has been bidden to kneel in adoration of that symbol, as if the natural man abr ogated his will before that of the Divine Conscious ness. As he kneels in the presence of the Triad of Arouer is, Thmaa-est and Horus, he places his left hand in that of his Initiator as affirming his pass ive reception of the Ritual, but his right hand is on the white triangle as symbolising his active aspiration towards his Higher Self. His head is bowed as representing the voluntary submission of the human will to the Divine and for this latter reason he re peats in the Obligation his name in the outer world. The Hierophant gives one knock, affirming that the submission unto the higher is perfect. Only at this moment, does the invisible and colossal figure of Thoth cease to be in the Sign of the Enterer an d give the Sign of Silence, permitting the first real descent of the Genius of the Candidate, who descen ds to the invisible station of Harpocrates as a witness o f the Obligation. The Hiereus and the Hierophant return to their Thro nes, and therefore it is not Aroueris, but Osiris himself that addresses the speech to the Can didate - “The Voice of my Higher Self,” etc., which confirms the link established between the Neschamah and the Genius by formulating the conception thereof into the Ruach. For this, Osiris speaks in the character of the Higher Soul, the symbolic form of which is standing between the Pillars before him. T he affirmation of the Higher Soul as the God of the man does not mean that this is the only God, but ra ther that it is the only presentment of Him which t he natural man can grasp at all. Neither is it just to say that the Higher Soul is one with God, seeing t hat the part is by no means the whole, nor can the whole be accurately and sufficiently described as an assemblage of parts. Let not the reverence for the God of thy self cause thee by a misconception to lo se thy reverence for the Gods who live forever - the A eons of Infinite Years. Herein is a great error and one which may, in the end, bring about the fall of the Genius, a sin which entails none the less terrible consequences because it is a sin of the higher plan e where the choice is not between good and evil but between the higher and the lower forms of good. Therefore is the Mystic Circumambulation in the Pat h of Darkness led by the Kerux with the symbolic light, as formulating that the Higher Soul is not the only Divine Light but rather a spark fr om the Ineffable Flame - and the Kerux, in his turn, i s but the Watcher of the Gods. After the Kerux come s the Hegemon, the translator of the Higher Self, lea ding the Candidate; and then come the Goddesses of the scales of the Balance, the Stolistes and the Da douchos. They move once round; the formation in the darkness of the Binah angle of the White Triangle o f the Three Supernals. The Hierophant knocks once a s they pass him"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 77 in affirmation of Mercy - the Hiereus in affirmatio n of Severity; and the invisible Assessors each giv e the Sign of the Enterer as the Candidate passes on his way. At the second passing of the Hierophant, the knock affirms the commencement of the angle of Chok mah. The Kerux bars the Candidate’s approach to the West to mark that the natural man cannot obtain the understanding of even the Son of Osiris unless by purification and equilibrium. Again is the Candi date purified and consecrated, the Pillars about his Sph ere of Sensation being rendered more manifest. Afte r this second consecration, the Candidate is allowed to approach the place of “The Twilight of the Gods” and for a brief space the hoodwink is slipped up, t o present a glimpse, but a glimpse only, of the Bey ond. In the challenge of the Hiereus to know the Name is signified the knowledge of the formula. For if the formula of Horus be not with the Candidate, that of Osiris cannot be grasped. But to the Candidate the power of Horus as yet can only appear as a terrible and incomprehensible force -“The Force of the Avenger of the Gods,” whence the speech of the Hege mon for him. The Candidate cannot as yet comprehend that before Mildness can be exercised ri ghtly, the forces of Severity and Mercy must be known and wielded, but to accomplish this the great est courage and energy is required and not hysteric al weakness and absence of resolution in action. Hence in the answer of the Hiereus is an affirmation of the necessity of courage and of the danger of fear, and he gives one knock to seal the vibration of that f orce imaged in the Candidate’s Sphere of Sensation. The next barring and consecration of the Candidate is an extension of the previous one and the commencement of the formulation of the angle of Ket her. The hood-wink is again slipped up giving a sti ll further glimpse of the nature of the Divine Light, though to the mind of the Candidate, an imperfect o ne. Therefore it is to him, as expressed in the answer of the Hegemon, a light dimly seen through the Darkness, yet heralding a Glory beyond. The speech of the Hierophant formulates the forces of the hidd en central Pillar. After this, the Candidate passes to the Altar of th e Universe, which receives the influences of the three Pillars, as though then the Ray from the Divi ne would descend into the darkness of the mind, for then, but not till then, is he fitted to realise wh at are the first things necessary to the “Search fo r the Shining Light.” The Hierophant now leaves his Throne and passes bet ween the Pillars, either halting there during the prayer or halting at the place of Harpocrates, or that of the Evil Triad, or East of the Altar. It does not particularly matter which, but one of them may seem more appropriate to a particular Candidate than another and the Hierophant will usually find that h e halts at the right place instinctively. The Hiereus stands on the left of the Candidate, th e Hegemon on his right, thus forming the Triad of the Supernals. The Kerux, Stolistes and Dadoucho s represent an inferior and supporting Triad behind him as if they affirmed that he has passed the Judg ment of the Balance. It is best, though not absolut ely necessary, that the Hierophant and the Hiereus shou ld hold their Banners. In any case, it should be do ne astrally. The Higher Self of the Candidate will be formulated in the invisible station of Harpocrates behind the Hierophant, who in his present position is Arou eris. The"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 78 Hierophant gives a single knock to seal the matter and then invokes the Lord of the Universe. Then onl y is the hoodwink removed definitely. The Hierophant, Hiereus, and Hegemon join sceptres and sword above the Candidate’s head, thus formulating the Supernal Triad, and assert his rece ption into the Order. They recite the mystic words to seal the current of the Flowing Light. The Higher Self remains in the station of Harpocrat es, and at this point, the spirit-vision should see a gleaming white triangle formulated over the C andidate’s head. The Hierophant now calls forward the Kerux, caution ing the Candidate that the Light has preceded him without his knowledge. It represents t o him here, a vague formulation of ideas which as y et he can neither grasp nor analyse. This Light is not a symbol of his Higher Self, but a Ray from the Go ds to lead him thereto. Only after having thus been brought to the Light is the Candidate led to the East of the Altar - the place of the station of the Evil Triad - to affirm that with this Light he will be able to cast out an d trample on his own Evil Persona which, when it has been put in its place, will then become a support to him. I t is to the Hiereus, “The Avenger of the Gods” therefore , that the duty of entrusting the Candidate with th e secret signs, etc., is delegated. It is he who plac es him for the first time between the Pillars and superintends his final consecration thus bringing t he peculiar force in matter of the Hiereus to the a id of the Candidate, so that he may more safely and resol utely combat the temptations of the Evil Persona. The Hierophant has returned to his Throne while the Hegemon holds the insignia of the Hiereus as he confers the Signs, etc. She thus affirms the necessity of the force represented by the Hiereus t o the Candidate. The Hierophant on the Throne, the Hiereus East of t he Black Pillar and the Hegemon East of the White Pillar, again form a Triad which here represe nts the reflection of the Three Supernals. The High er Soul is formulated between the Pillars in the Place of Equilibrium. The Candidate is in the place of t he Evil Triad and the Hiereus now advances to the plac e of Harpocrates between the Pillars to give the words. After the giving of the words and signs, the Hiereu s draws the Candidate forward between the Pillars and for the second time in the Ceremony, th e Higher Soul stands near and ready to touch him. T he Hiereus returns to his place East of the Black Pill ar so that the Three Chief Officers may formulate a nd draw down to the Candidate, by their insignia, and the influence of their symbols, the forces of the Supernal Triad. It is important, therefore, that at this point, they should be in these places. The Candidate now stands between the Pillars, bound with a rope like the mummied form of Osiris, between Isis and Nephthys. The final Consec ration now takes place by the Goddess of the Scales of the Balance. The Candidate stands for the first time during the Ceremony at the point representing the equilibrium of the balance. Meanwhile, the Kerux go es to the North, ready for the circumambulation so as to link that with the final Consecration of the Can didate. The final Consecration is also demanded by the Hiereus Horus, the powerful Avenger of Osiris, as s till menacing the Evil Persona of the"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 79 Candidate. Its effect is to seal finally, in balanc ed formation, the Four Pillars in the Sphere of Sen sation of the Candidate. This does not imply that they were n ot naturally there before. But in the natural man, the symbols are unbalanced in strength - some being wea ker and some stronger. The effect of the Ceremony is to strengthen the weak, to purify the strong, an d so begin to equilibriate them and at the same tim e make a link between them and the corresponding forc es of the Macrocosm. This being done, the Hierophant commands the remova l of the Rope which has hitherto been purposely retained, symbolically to restrain the ac tions of the natural man, whose temptation is towar ds the Evil Persona. The Four Pillars being thus firmly established, the Candidate is invested with the Badge of the White Triangle of the Three Supernals formulating i n Darkness. Now, also, the Higher Self is enabled i n reality to form a link with him, if the human will of the natural man be in reality consenting thereto . The free-will of the natural man is never obsessed eith er by the Higher Soul or by the Ceremony, but, the will consenting, the whole of the Ceremony is directed t o strengthening its action. As the badge is placed upon him, it is as if the tw o Great Goddesses, Isis and Nephthys, stretched forth their wings over Osiris to restore him again to life. The Mystic Circumambulation follows in the Path of Light to represent the rising of Light in the Candidate, through the operation of self-sacrifice. As he passes the Hierophant’s throne the red Calva ry Cross is astrally formed above the astral White Tri angle on his forehead, so that so long as he belong s to the Order, he may bear that potent and sublime symb ol as a link with his Higher Self and as an aid in searching out the forces of the Divine Light - if h e will. The Higher Soul or Genius now returns to the invisi ble station of Harpocrates, the place of the hidden Centre, yet continuing to retain the link fo rmed with the Candidate. The address of the Hieroph ant is intended simply to effect the distinct formulati on of the symbols of the Grade of Neophyte in the Candidate, and it is therefore only when this is fi nished that the Watcher Anubis announces that the Candidate has been duly admitted as an initiated Ne ophyte. The Hiereus is charged with a warning address as ag ain confirming the will of the Candidate and addressing a final menance to the Evil Persona. The Hierophant then states clearly what the Candidate must begin to study. He affirms that the symbols mu st be equilibriated in the Sphere of Sensation befo re a link can be formulated between them and the Forces of the Macrocosm. The necessity of examination is insisted upon so that this may be completely done. The Kerux then pours out the two fluids to make the semblance of blood. This is to fix in the Candidate’s sphere the symbols of the forces of tra nsmutation in Nature and also to make an astral lin k between these and the Candidate’s physical life, as a guard of the secrecy"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 80 of the Mysteries. This particular form of transmuta tion is used as showing the effect of a mixture of forces as producing a third appearance totally different f rom them. The red colour is symbolic of the blood o f the Candidate. In the Ancient Mysteries, the Candidate’ s blood was actually drawn at this time and preserv ed as an avenging link in case of his proving unworthy . Yet our transmutation effects the matter quite as well, seeing that the astral link is firmly establi shed. The final speech of the Hierophant is further inten ded besides its apparent meaning, to affirm that a person only partially initiated is neither fitted to teach nor to instruct even the outer and more i gnorant in Sublime Knowledge. He is certain, through misund erstanding the principles, to formulate error inste ad of truth. CLOSING The greater part of the closing ceremony is explain ed by the opening. The Reverse Circumambulation, however, is intended to formulate the withdrawal of the Light of the Supernal Triad from the Altar, so that it may not be profaned by a biding without due guard. Not that the Divine Light would suffer thereby, but because it might initiate an Avenging Current if profaned. This is what is implied by the Law of Moses in the prohibition abou t offering unconsecrated Fire either before or with in the Veil of the Tabernacle. As a vibratory formula, the reverse Circumambulation represents the revers al of the current and the restoration of the Operator to his ordinary condition. The Mystic Repast then follows. It is a communion i n the body of Osiris. Its Mystic Name is “The Formula of the Justified One,” and it is suffi ciently explained in the section concerning the Alt ar. The Kerux, in finishing, inverts the Cup, as the Wa tcher of the Gods, to show that the symbols of self-sacrifice and of regeneration are accomplished . The proclamation is confirmed by the Hierophant a nd the Chief Officers giving the three knocks, emblema tic of the Mystic Triad, and they repeat the Mystic Words. The Hierophant, in his final speech, seals the link first formulated between the Members and the Supernal Triad for each one present that it may pro ve to him or her, a guide for the ultimate attainme nt of the Supreme Initiation - if he will. THE SYMBOLISM AND MEANING OF THE STEP, SIGNS, GRIP OR TOKEN, AND THE WORDS They have this three-fold interpretation: 1. Apparent meaning. 2. Spiritual or Mystical reference. 3. Practical application. Each is therefore considered under three heads."},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 81 First, the foot is advanced about six inches repres enting the foot on the side of Chesed put forward and taking a hesitating step in darkness - the left foot, to represent the power of Isis or th e beginning of action rather than Nephthys as the end thereof. The term 6 inches is employed here only t o render it more intelligible to English Initiates. I t means a convenient measure of 6, and preferably 6 times the measure of the Phalanx of the thumb -the spirit and will. Second, it symbolises the beginning of the stamping down of the Evil Persona. The foot is advanced 6 metrical distances answering to the numb er 6 of Tiphareth - Osiris - alluding therefore to the self-sacrifice necessary to accomplish this. Third, it represents the practical application of t he beginning of a magical force. Let the Adept, in using the Sign of the Enterer, give the step as he commences the Sign and let him imagine himself colossal, clothed with the form of the God or Godde ss appropriate to the work - his head reaching to t he clouds - his feet resting upon Earth. And let him t ake the step as if he stamped upon the Earth and th e Earth quaked and rocked beneath him. As it is said “Clouds and Darkness are round about Him - lightnings and thunders are the habitation of His f eet.” Its secret name is “The Step of the Avenger.” THE SALUTING SIGN 1. That of groping forward in search of truth. 2. It represents the involution and bringing forwar d of the Light into the material to aid the will of the Candidate in his search for and aspiration towa rds the Higher. 3. Standing as before described, in the form of the God, and elevating the mind to the contemplation of Kether, take the step like a strok e with the foot, bring the arms up above the head a s if touching the Kether, and as the step is completed b ring the hands over the head forwards. Thrust them out directly from the level of the eyes horizontally - arms extended, fingers straight, palms downwards, t he hands directed towards the object it is wished to c harge or to affect. At the same time, sink the head till the eyes look exactly between the thumbs. In this w ay, the rays from the eyes, from each finger and fr om the thumbs, must all converge upon the object attac ked. If any of them disperse, it is a weakness. Thus performed, this Sign is a symbol of tremendous attacking force and of projection of will power, and it should be employed in all cases where force of attack is required especially in charging of Talismans and the like. Generally, it is best to ha ve the thumbs and all the fingers extended - but if a particular effect is desired, you may extend only t he fingers appropriate thereto, keeping the rest fo lded back in the hand. Herewith also, may be combined th e attribution of the Planets to the head: (Mars to the right nostril, Mercury to"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 82 the Mouth, etc., as explained in the Microcosm Lect ure), sending at the same time an imaginary ray of colour of the Planet desired from the part of the h ead attributed to it. But, when finished, be carefu l to withdraw the rays again or they will remain like so many outlets of astral force and thus exhaust you. The best way to protect yourself against this is to giv e the Sign of Silence immediately. For the first Si gn should always be answered by the second. The secret names of the Saluting Sign is “The Attacking Sign” or “The Sign of the Enterer of the Threshold.” THE SIGN OF SILENCE 1. This is simply that of secrecy regarding the My steries. 2. It is the affirmation of the station of Harpocra tes, wherein the Higher Soul of the Candidate is formulated in part of the admission Ceremony. It is the symbol of the Centre and the “Voice of the Silence” which answers in secret the thought of the heart. 3. The Sign of Silence withdraws the force put out by the Sign of the Enterer. Take upon thyself as before taught the colossal form of the G od Harpocrates. Bring the left foot sharply back, b oth heels together - beat the ground once with the left foot as it is placed beside the right. Bring the l eft hand to the mouth and touch the centre of the lower lip with the left fore-finger. Close the other fingers and thumb, and drop the right hand to the side. Imagine that a watery vapor encircles and encloses you. Th is is the reflux of the current. This Sign is also used as a protection against atta ck. The Sign represents a concentration of astral light about the person. Having given the Sign as ab ove, it is a protection against all attack and dang er of obsession. To make it yet stronger, the form of the God should be taken. If Spiritual force is require d, formulate as if standing on a Lotus or rising from it. For force in contemplation and meditation, form ulate as if seated upon a Lotus. But for more material fo rce, as if standing upon a Dragon or a Serpent like some statues of Harpocrates. As a defence and prote ction, the Sign is as strong as the banishing pentagram, though of a different nature. And as the Sign of the Enterer represents attack, so does thi s sign represent defence thereto, as a shield is a defence against the Sword. From this Sign is a formula of invisibility derived. The Secret Names of this Sign are: “The Sign of the God of Silence” or the “Sign of Defence or Protection.” It may be performed with any finger of either hand, but it is most protective when the le ft forefinger is used, the Water of Chesed, for the fi ngers of the right hand represent more violent acti on, and those of the left more watery action. It may here be remarked that the so-called Christia n Sign of Benediction, consisting of the thumb and first two fingers only, projected, is the affir mation of Osiris, isis and Nephthys - or Spirit, Fi re, and Water. With regard to taking on mentally the forms of the Gods, it may here be noted that the process is of great assistance and use in all magic al working , whether of invokation or of"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 83 evocation, contemplation, meditation, skrying in th e spirit vision, alchemy, etc. For the forms of the Gods do here represent a certain symbolic material actio n of the Divine Forces. THE GRIP AND THE PASSWORD 1. The steps are taken and the Grip exchanged simul taneously. They mean seeking guidance in the darkness and silence of the Mysteri es. 2. It shows that a steady and resolute will, acting in union with good, will accomplish what it desires, no matter how often it fail at fir st. It inculcates the necessity for harmony and brotherly love - of doing away with pettiness and o f too much self-concentration - for allowances for the weaknesses of others within limits - of shunning re solutely anything in the nature of slander. So that in the grip of the Neophyte the Initiates meet hand to hand and foot to foot in the true greeting of a br other or sister, and not in the veiled hostility of an en emy. For, in the working of the Inner, where all in voke the same forces in the same manner, when he or she beco mes unsympathetic with the rest, there is a separation from them, and though he weaken the comb ination of working, yet he still more certainly attracts upon himself a reflex current from the Ave ngers of Evil. The Names of the God of Silence which is the Grand Word of this Grade also represents the silence of the Sacred Mysteries to be observed towa rds the Outer Order. It shows also the necessity fo r respect towards the secrets of any Frater or Soror committed to your care, not endeavouring to search them out for purposes of curiosity nor repeating th em when discovered, nor in any way referring to the m so as to wound the other, nor in any way employing them as a means of causing humiliation, but to keep them as a sacred trust and not to be deflected by t hem from acting justly and harmoniously together. 3. In any magical ceremony, or other working, if mo re than one member be taking part, all present, putting themselves into the form of th e God as taught, should exchange Sign, Grip and Words, so as to establish a current of harmony and the affirmation of a mutual direction of will towards the same object. THE PASSWORD 1. Merely to guard the secrets of the Order against any Members resigned or not working; hence changed each Equinox. 2. It is an affirmation of the different spiritual as well as the different physical constitutions of the Candidates - that all natures cannot be the same without evil and injury resulting thereby - but that each nature should be brought to its own Kether - the best of its kind. T his too, may be done in all things. It is the basis of Alche my. 3. lt should be pronounced as if attracting the Sol ar Force - the Light of Nature, during the 6 months following the Equinox at which it is i ssued, as a link with the Solar Force, between that and the Order. This password, therefore, may a lso be used in a magical ceremony as attracting the support of the Light of Nature acting upon natural forces."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 84 THE CEREMONY OF THE EQUINOX The whole formulae of the Ceremony of the Equinox a re intended to create a magical link between the Sun, as the Light of Nature, and the Or der; and it should be celebrated within 48 hours at least of the Sun’s actual entry into Aries or Libra . The single knock given by the Hierophant heralds the initiation of a fresh current. The Password, as alr eady explained, is the symbol of the connecting lin k of the purpose of the Ceremony and therefore, before b eginning a fresh operation to attract a fresh curre nt, the Kerux proclaims that the former password is abr ogated. In the whole Ceremony, save at the exchange of Insignia, the Hierophant, Hiereus, Hegemon, Stol istes and Dadouchos remain in their places - the Kerux, or Watcher of the Gods being the only one wh o moves. First comes the establishment of a vertical current in the direction of the Middle Pillar by the exchange of words between the Hierophant and Hiereu s, while the Hegemon, who is in the whole Ceremony of the Equinox the important Officer, by r eason of his insignia, seals and arrests the curren t in the centre by a single knock and the words “I am th e Reconciler between them.” Then follows the cross current established between the Stolistes and Dadou chos - again fixed and sealed by the Hegemon, thus symbolising the equilateral cross of the Elements ( of which the centre would naturally be about the invisible station of Harpocrates) but is arrested b y the Hegemon between the Pillars. The cross curren ts are thus thrown into the image of the Calvary Cross of the Rivers to ally it with the symbolism of Tiphareth and of the Sephiroth. Then the Hierophant, Dadouchos, Hiereus, and Stolis tes formulate a circle enclosing the symbol, which is again sealed by the Hegemon. Then the Offi cers, being careful to follow the course of the Sun deposit in turn, their Insignia upon the Altar, tak ing therefrom instead the mystical symbols of the B ody of Osiris corresponding to their Cardinal Points. T he Hegemon takes the Lamp of Kerux. The Kerux then circumambulates, halting at the Cardinal Points and facing them, representing the course of the Sun through the Zodiac in order to attract the Solar Ra y, but under the control of its Superior, the Light of Osiris, and the adorations are performed at the Sta tions of the Kerubim to mark the limits of the Circ le. This time, it is with the Lamp of the Watcher of th e Gods and with the Sign of the Calvary Cross of Tiphareth that the Hegemon seals in the centre t he Solar Light. The formal assertion of the entry o f a new current of Light is proclaimed, and the Mystic Words are recited to close the ceremony. From this Ceremony there are many practical formula e derivable which will be easily comprehended by the Z.A.M. who has mastered the who le of this lecture. Only let him remember that the formulae of the Ceremony of the Equinox represents the sudden attraction and sealing of a Force in Nature then in operation - rather than a continuous and graduated ceremony to build up the same. Consequently also, it is well to use the password t hen in being as an adjunct to the other Names emplo yed in magical ceremonies as bringing into operation th e link with the Solar Light."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"VOLUME SIX 85 NOTES ON THE OPENING EXORDIUM OF “Z” The Great Thoth is the highest aspect of the Hermes of the most ancient Egyptian Mysteries, and corresponds almost to the Great Angel Metatron. It is the Archangel of Kether in the Briatic World. Th e Mercury of the Romans must not be confused with thi s Great Hermes. The doctrines of Gnosticism and of Valentinus appro ached those of the pure Qabalah. In them we find Speech and Silence. Across the Abyss of Silenc e comes the Primal Speech. The Divine Ones here referred to are the Aeons in the Atziluthic World. These formulae of knowledge are designed in terms cognizable to us in the lower world. Eheieh - implicit and explicit sound. “Every being pronounces all its existence, the Name of the Lord of Life, by inspiration and expiration.” Macroprosopus is Aima and Abba, Mother - Father. Th e two nostrils pass up and down the two breaths, as through the two Great Pillars. These th row all things into vibration; compare the Rashith ha- Gilgalim. Piercing of the Dragon’s Coils suggests f reeing of Malkuth, which is also referred to as the Washing of the Garments of the Queen, the Inferror Mother. Then comes the Breaking Forth of the Light. Over Malkuth as Guardians are Metatron and Sandaiph on as the Two Pillars, and Nephesch ha-Messiah, the animal soul of Messiah, the Shekinah or Presenc e between the Kerubim. THE PARTICULAR EXORDIUM The Borniess Ones of Time referred to are those Cor ruscations of the Divine Light which are above Kether of Atziluth. In such Supernal Realms, the Am Soph, though negative to us, is there intensely positive. Thence came forth the Gods, the Voice, the Aeons, and the Name. The Egyptian Gods are generally most differentiated by their Crowns: Amen-Ra by the high feathers, Mo-ooth (Maut) has the same headdress as Horus. She corresponds to Aima Elohim. The high Hermes-Thoth has the same headress as Amoun Kneph, the Sacred Spirit. Remember that Thoth, Truth, has two aspects - the higher and the lower. The hig her is Absolute, the lower is suitable to human comprehension.

It is composed of 22 squares externally thus referring to the 22 Hebr ew letters which are placed thereon. Twenty-two are th e letters of the Eternal Voice; in the Vault of Hea ven, in the depth of the Earth, in the Abyss of Water, i n the all-presence of Fire; Heaven cannot speak the ir fullness, Earth cannot utter it. Yet hath the Creat or bound them in all things. He hath mingled them through Water. He hath whirled them aloft in Fire; He hath sealed them in the air of Heaven; He hath distributed them through the Planets; He hath assig ned unto them the 12 Constellations of the zodiac. (Places Cubical Cross aside.) The Thirty-second Path of the Sepher Yetzirah whic h answereth unto the Letter Tau is called the Administrative Intelligenc e and it is so called because it directeth and asso ciateth in all their operations the Seven Planets, even all of them in their own due courses. To it therefore, is attributed the due knowledge of the Seven abodes of Assiah, the Material World, which are symbolized i n the Apocalypse by the Seven Churches. It refers to the Universe as composed of the Four elements; to t he Kerubim; to the Qlippoth, and to the Astral Plane. It is the Reflection of the Sphere of Saturn. It represents the connecting and binding link between the Material and Formative worlds, Assiah and Yetzirah, and necessarily passes through the Astral Plane, the abode of the elementals, the Qlippoth, and the Shells of the Dead. It is the rending of the Ve il of the Tabernacle whereon the Kerubim and the Pa lm Trees were depicted; it is the passing of the Gate of Eden. (Leads Zelator to the West of the Altar.)

The oval of 72 sm all circles is the Schem-hamphorasch, or the 72 fold Name of the D eity. The 12 larger circles form the Zodiac. At the angles are the four Kerubim, which are the vivified Powers of the Letters of the Name Tetragramaton operating in the elements, through which you have j ust symbolically passed in the preceding ceremony.

The cross within the triangle, apex downwards placed upon th e Altar at the base of the Tree of Life, refers to th e Four Rivers of Paradise, while the angles of the Triangle refer to the Three Sephiroth NETZACH, HOD and YESOD .

It represents you in the Path of Yesod, supporting the Pillars of Mercy and Severity; it is the sign of the classical Atlas, supporting the Un iverse upon his shoulders, whom Hercules had to emulate. I t is the Isis of Nature supporting the Heavens. The grip is the general grip of the First Order. The Gr and Word is a name of seven letters which means the Vast and Mighty One - SHADDAI EL CHAI. The mystic n umber is 45 and from it is formed the Pass Word which is Mem, Heh, Mah. It should be lettered separately when given.

Hiereus: (For Theoricus) By the Symbol of the Pyramid of Flame. Heg: Hear thou the Voice of Axiokersa the Third Kabir. T he Father hath hastily withdrawn Himself, but hath not shut up his own Fire in His intellectual Power. All things are sprung from that one Fire. For all things did the Father of all things perfect, and delivered them over unto the Second Mind, whom all races of men call First. The Mind of the Father riding on the su btle girders which glitter with the tracings of inf lexible and relentless Fire. The Soul being a brilliant Fir e, by the Power of the Father remaineth Immortal, a nd is mistress of Life, and filleth up the many recesses of the Bosom of the World. The channels being intermixed therein she performeth the works of inco rruptible Fire. Hereunto is the Speech of Axiokersa . Heg: Places Theoricus in a seat in the West between hims elf and Hiereus and facing Hierophant, takes Pyramid from him. Hiero: Stoop not down into the darkly splendid world, wher ein continually lies a faithless Depth, and Hades wrapped in clouds, delighting in unintelligible Ima ges, precipitous, winding, a black ever rolling aby ss ever espousing a body unluminous, formless and void . Nature persuadeth us that there are pure Demons, and that even the evil germs of Matter may alike be come useful and good. But these are mysteries which are evoked in the profound Abyss of the Mind. Such a Fire existeth extending through the rushings of A ir or even a Fire Formless whence comes the Image of a Voice or even a flashing Light abounding, revolving, whirling forth, crying aloud. Also there is the vision of the Fire flashing Courser of Ligh t, or also a Child borne aloft on the shoulders of the Ce lestial Steed, fiery or clothed with gold, or naked or shooting with the bow shafts of light, and standing on the shoulders of the horse.

For thou m ust not behold it ere thy body is purged by the sac red Rites.

And when after all the Phantoms are banished thou shalt see that Holy and Formless Fire , that Fire which darts and flashes through the hid den depths of the Universe Hear thou the Voice of Fire. Hereunto is the speech of the Kabiri. Heg: Turns up Lights and then conducts Candidate to foot of Hierophant's throne, and hands Theoricus the solid Triangular Pyramid. Hiero: The solid Triangular Pyramid is an appropriate hier oglyph of Fire. It is formed of 4 triangles, 3 visi ble and one concealed, which yet use the synthesis of t he rest. The 3 visible triangles represent Fire Sol ar, Volcanic and Astral, while the 4th represents the L atent Heat. The three words AUD, AUB, AUR refer to the three conditions of Heat, Aud, active; Aub, pas sive; Aur, equilibrated; whilst Asch is the Name of Fire. The 31st Path of the Sepher Yetzirah which an swereth unto the Letter Shin, is called the Perpetu al Intelligence, and it is so called because it regula teth the Motions of the Sun and Moon in their prope r order, each in an Orbit convenient for it. It is th erefore the reflection of the Sphere of Fire, and t he Path connecting the material Universe as depicted in Mal kuth, with the Pillar of Severity on the side of Geburah, through the Sephira Hod. Hierophant, Hegemon and Theoricus come to West of A ltar. Hiero: Before you upon the Altar is the 20 th Key of the Tarot, which symbolically resumes the i deas. To the uninitiated eye it apparently represents the Last J udgement, with an angel blowing a trumpet and the D ead rising from the tombs. But its meaning is far more occult and recondite than this, for it is a glyph o f the Powers of Fire. The Angel encircled by a Rainbow wh ence leap coruscation’s of Fire, and crowned with the Sun, represents Michael, the great Archangel, t he Ruler of Solar Fire. The Serpents which leap in the rainbow are symbols of the Fiery Seraphim. The trum pet represents the influence of the Spirit descendi ng from Binah, while the Banner with the Cross refers to the four rivers of Paradise and the letters of t he Holy Name. He also is Axieros, the first of the Sam othracian Kabiri, as well as Zeus and Osiris. The l eft hand figure below, rising from the Earth is Samael, the Ruler of Volcanic Fire. He is also Axiokersos, the 2 nd Kabir, Pluto and Typhon. The right hand figure bel ow is Anadl, the Ruler of the Astral Light. She is also Axiokersa, the third Kabir, Ceres and Proserpi na, Isis and Nephthys. She is therefore represented in a duplicate form and rising from the Water. Around bo th these figures dart flashes of lightning. These 3 principal figures form the Fire Triangle, and furth er represent Fire operating in the other three Elem ents of Air, Earth, and Water. The central lower figure with his back turned and his arms extended in the S ign of Theoricus is Arel the Ruler of Latent Heat, he i s rising from the Earth, as if to receive and absor b the properties of the other three. He is also Kasmillos the Candidate in the Samothracian Mysteries, and t he Horus of Egypt. He rises from the rock hewn cubical tomb, and also alludes to the Candidate who traverses the Path of Fire. The three lower Figures represent the Hebrew Letter Shin to which fire is especially referred. The 7 Hebrew Yods allude to th e Sephiroth operating in each of the Planets and to the Schem-hamphorasch. Hiero: Returns to his place.

Hiero: The Solar Creek Cross is formed of 13 squares, whic h fitly refer to the Sun's motion through the Zodia c. These signs being further arranged in the arms of t he cross according to the four Elements with the Su n in the center, represent that luminary as the center o f the The 30 th Path of the Sepher Yetzirah. Which answereth unto the letter Resh is called the Collec ting Intelligence, and it is so called because from it astrologers deduce the judgement of the stars, and of the celestial signs, and the perfections of thei r science according to the rules of their revolutions . It is therefore, the reflection of the sphere of the Sun, and the Path connecting Yesod with Hod, Foundation with Splendor. Hierophant, Theoricus and Hegemon come to West of A ltar. Hiero: Before you upon the Altar is the 19 th Key of the Tarot which symbolically resumes these Ideas. The Sun has 12 principal rays which represent the 12 signs of the Zodiac, they are alternatively waved and sal ient, as symbolizing the alternation of the masculine and feminine natures. These are again subdivided into 36 rays representing the 36 Decanates or sets of 10 de grees in the Zodiac, and these again into 72 typify ing the 72 Quinaries or sets of 5 degrees and the 72 fo ld name SHEM- HA-MEPHORASCH. Thus the Sun itself embraces the whole Creation in its rays. The ·7 Hebrew Yods on each side falling through the air , refer to the Solar influence descending. The wall i s the circle of the Zodiac and the stones are its v arious degrees and divisions. The two children standing re spectively on Water and Earth, represent the generating influence of both brought into action by the rays of the Sun. They are the two Inferior or passive Elements, as the Sun and the Air above them are the Superior and Active Elements, of Fire and Air. Furthermore, these two children resemble the s ign Gemini, which unites the Earthly sign of Taurus with the Watery sign of Cancer and this sign was by the Greeks and Romans referred to Apollo or the Sun.

And whereas the Name Tetragrammaton is joined to the Elohim when it is said Tetragrammaton Elohim planted a Garden Eastward in Eden so this represents the power of the Father joined thereto i n the Glory from the face of the Ancient of Days. A nd in the Garden were the Tree of Life, and the Tree o f the Knowledge of good and Evil, which latter is f rom Malkuth, which is the lowest Sephira between the re st of the Sephiroth and the Kingdom of the Shells, which latter is represented by the Great Red Dragon coiled beneath, having 7 heads (the 7 infernal Palaces) and ten horns (the 10 Averse Sephiroth con tained in the 7 Palaces). And a River Nahar went forth out of Eden, (namely the Supernal Triad) to w ater the Garden (the rest of the Sephiroth) and fro m thence it was divided into four heads in DAATH when ce it is said In Daath the depths are broken up, an d the clouds drop down dew. The first head is Pison w hich flows into Geburah where there is Gold, it is the River of Fire. The second head is Gihon the river o f Waters, flowing into Chesed. The third is Hiddeke l the River of air flowing into Tiphareth. And the fo urth River which receiveth the virtue of the other three is Euphrates which floweth down upon Malkuth, the E arth. This River going forth out of Eden is the River of the Apocalypse, of Waters of Life, clear a s crystal, proceeding out of the Throne of God and the Lamb on either side of which was the Tree of Life b earing 12 manner of Fruit.

And the Countenance of Darkness half formed, arose. They ab ode not, they hasted away. And in the vastness of Vacancy, the Spirit moved, and the Light-bearers ex isted for a space. I have said Darkness of Darkness ; Are not the countenances of Darkness fallen with th e Kings? Do the Sons of the Night of Time last forever? And have they not passed away? Before all things are the Waters, and the Darkness, and the Gates of the Land of Night. And the Chaos cried alo ud for the Unity of Form, and the Face of the Etern al arose. Before the Glory of that Countenance the nig ht rolled back and the Darkness hasted away. In the Waters beneath was that Face reflected, in the Form less Abyss of the Void. From those Eyes darted rays of terrible splendor which crossed with the Current s reflected. That Brow and those Eyes formed the Triangle of the measureless Heavens, and their refl ection formed the Triangle of the Measureless Water s. And thus was formulated the Eternal Hexad, the Numb er of the Dawning Creation. Heg: Turns up the lights and then conducts the Practicus to the foot of Hierophant's throne, handing Practicus the Calvary Cross of 12 squares. Hiero: The Calvary Cross of 12 Squares fitly represents th e Zodiac, which embraces the Waters of Nu, as the ancient Egyptians called the heavens; the Waters wh ich be above the Firmament. It also alludes to the Eternal River of Eden divided into four heads which finds their correlatives in the four triplicities of the Zodiac. (Places Cross aside.) The 29th Path of the Sepher Yetzirah which answere th to the letter Qoph, is called the Corporeal Intelligence, and it is so cal led because it formeth every body which is formed beneath the whole Order of Worlds, and the Incremen t of them. It is there, the reflection of the Spher e of the Watery Sign Pisces, and the Path connecting the Material Universe as depicted in Malkuth, with the Pillar of Mercy, and the side of Chesed through the Sephira Netzach. And through it do the Waters of Chesed flow down. Hiero: Heg: Pract: Move to West of Altar. Hiero: Before you upon the Altar is the 18 th Key of the Tarot, which symbolically resumes these ideas. It represents the Moon with four Hebrew Yods, like dro ps of dew falling, two dogs, two towers, a winding pathway leading to the horizon, and in the foregrou nd, Water, with a crayfish crawling through it towa rds land. The Moon is in the increase on the side of Ge dulah, and from it proceed sixteen principal and sixteen secondary rays, which together make 32, the number of the Paths of Yetzirah. She is the Moon a t the feet of the Woman of the Revelation, ruling equ ally over Cold and Moist Natures, and the Passive Elements of Earth and Water. The four Hebrew Yods r efer to the four letters of the Holy Name reconstituting the destroyed World from the Waters. It is to be noted that the symbol of the Sign Pisc es is formed of the two lunar crescents of Gedulah and Ge burah bound together, and thus shows the lunar nature of the Sign. The Dogs are the Jackals of the Egyptian Anubis, guarding the Gates of the East an d of the West, shown by the two Towers, between which li es the Path of all the Heavenly Bodies ever rising in the East and setting in the West. The Crayfish is t he sign Cancer, and was anciently the Scarabus or Khephra, the emblem of the Sun below the horizon as he ever is when the Moon is increasing above. Also when the Sun is in the Sign Pisces, the Moon will b e well in her increase in Cancer as shown by the Crayfish emblem. Hiero: Leads Practicus to Tablet of the Serpent of Brass i n East. Hiero: This is the Serpent Nehushtan which Moses made when the Children of Israel were bitten by the Serpents of Fire in the wilderness. It is the Serpent of the Paths of the Tree. And he set it on a pole, that i s, twined round the middle Pillar of the Sephiroth.

And th e Serpent is of Brass, the Metal of Venus, whose Sp here is called Nogah or External Splendor, as shown furt her in the Alchemic symbol of the Planet Venus, wherein the circle of the Sun is exalted above the Cross of corrosion. And therefore it is said in the Zohar, that alone of the Shells is the Serpent Nogah found in Holiness, and he is called the Bilanx of Justic e. Why then is he called the External or false Splendo r? Because he indeed uniteth the Paths but comprehendeth not the Sephiroth. Nevertheless he is also the Celestial Serpent of Wisdom. But the Serpent of Temptation is the Serpent of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and not that of the Tre e of Life. Hiero: Resumes his seat. Heg: Leads Practicus to Hiereus. Hiereus: (Indicating Tablet) This is the so-called Qabalah of Nine Chambers. In it the letters are classed together, according to the similarity of their numbers. Thus, in one chamber you will see Gimel, Lamed and Shin classed together, whose numbers are similar 3, 30, 300 and so on. The uppermost is the most usual form of the diagram. In the lower the chambers are arran ged according to the Sephiroth. This Tablet (indica ting it) represents the method of 'forming the Tree of L ife in the Tarot. The four Aces are placed on the T hrone of Kether. The remaining small cards of each suit d esired are then placed on the respective Sephiroth, 2 on Chokmah, 3 on Binah and so on. The 22 Trumps are then arranged on the letters of the Paths between them. The King and Queen of the Suit are placed bes ide Chokmah and Binah respectively, the Knight beside Tiphareth and the Knave beside Malkuth, thus representing the attribution of the Sephiroth to t he four letters of the Holy Name in the World wherein they operate. Heg: Leads Practicus to Tablet of The Pillars in South. Heg: This Tablet represents the formation of the Hexagra m of Tiphareth from the Pillars on each side. In Chesed is the Water and in Geburah is the Fire, and in Tiphareth is the uniting and reconciliation of both Triangles in the Hexagram, as Aleph forms the recon ciliation between Mem and Shin so thus stands the reconciling Pillar between the Pillars of Fire and of Cloud; the Yakin and Boat of Solomon's Temple. Heg: Leads Practicus to Tablet in North. Heg: The mode of using the Talismanic forms drawn from t he Geomantic figures, is to take those formed by the figures under the Planet required and place the m at the opposite ends of a wheel of 8 radii as sho wn. A versicle suitable to the matter is then written wit hin the double circle. Hiero: I have much pleasure in now conferring upon you the title of Lord (Lady) of the 29 th Path.

I am the Giver of the Mist Veil of Autumn, the successor of the Dew clad Night. Heg: Replaces lamp and seats Practicus West of and close to the Altar facing Hierophant, then returns to hi s own seat. Hiero: Where the Paternal Monad is, the Monad is enlarged and generateth two. And beside him is seated the Duad, and both glittereth with intellectual Section s, also to govern all things and to order everythin g not ordered. For in the whole Universe shineth the Tria d, over which the Monad ruleth. This Order is the beginning of all Sections. Hiereus: For the Mind of the Father said, that all things sh ould be cut into three whose will assented, and the n all things were so divided. For the mind of the Eternal Father said into three, governing all things by Mi nd. And there appeared in it the Triad, Virtue, and Wis dom and Multiscient Truth.

The Matrix c ontaining all, thence abundantly springing forth th e generation of multifarious Matter. Heg: Conducts Practicus to foot of the Hierophant's Thro ne and hands to the Practicus the Solid Pyramid of the elements. Hiero: This Pyramid is attributed to the Four elements. On the four Triangles are their names, Asch, Fire; Mayim, Water; Ruach, Air; Aretz, Earth; On the apex is the word Eth, composed of the first and last letters of the Alphabet and implying Essence. The S quare Base represents the Material Universe, and on it is the word Ohlam, meaning World. (Places Pyramid aside.) The 28 th Path of Yetzirah, which answereth unto the letter Tzaddi is called the Natural Intell igence, and it is so called because through it is consummated and perfected the Nature of every exist ing being under the Orb of the Sun. It is therefore the reflection of the Airy Sign of Aquarius, the Wa ter bearer unto which is attributed the Countenance of the Man, the Adam, the restored World. Hiero: Heg: Pract: Move to the West of Altar. Hiero: Before you upon the altar is the 17 th Key of the Tarot, which symbolically resumes these ideas. The large Star in the center of the Heavens has seven princip al and 14 secondary rays, and thus represents the Heptad multiplied by the Triad which yields 21 the number of the Divine name, EHEIEH which as you already know is attached to Kether. In the Egyptian sense it is Sirius, the Dog Star of Isis Sothis; a round it are the Stars of the Seven Planets, each with its s evenfold counterchanged operation. The nude female figure with the Star of the Heptagram on her Brow i s the synthesis of Isis, of Nephthys and of Athor. She also represents the Planet Venus, through whose Sph ere the influences of Chesed descend. She is Aima, Binah and Tebunah, the Great Supernal Mother, Aima Elohim pouring upon the Earth the Waters of Creation, which unite and form a river at her feet; the river going forth from the Supernal Eden, whic h overfloweth and faileth not. Note well that in this Key she is completely unveiled, while in the 21 st Key, she is only partly so. The two Urns contain the Inf luences from Chokmah and Binah. On the right spring s the Tree of Life and on the left the Tree of Knowle dge of Good and Evil, whereon the bird of Hermes alights. And therefore does this Key represent the Restored World after the Formless and the Void and the Darkness, the New Adam, the Countenance of the Man which falls in the Sign Aquarius. And therefore doth the Astronomical symbol of this sign represent as it were, the waves of water, the ripples of tha t River going forth out of Eden. But therefore, also it is justly attributed unto Air and not unto Water , because it is the Firmament dividing and containing the Waters. Hierophant and Practicus go to East. Hiero: Before you is shown the manner of writing the Holy Name in each of the four Worlds at length, by givin g the spelling of each letter. You will note that the spelling of the letter Yod alone alters not. It is a symbol of the unchangeableness of the First Cause. The tot al of the spelling in each World, is then expressed in Hebrew letters and makes the Secret name of that Wo rld. Thus, in Atziluth the total is 72, and the Sec ret name AUB, in Binah 63 SEG, in Yetzirah 45 MAH and i n Assiah 52 BEN. (Indicating the end Tablet.) In the Tablet is shown the method of writing the He brew words by the Yetziratic attribution of the alphabet, whence result some curious hieroglyphic s ymbolism. Thus, Tetragrammaton will be written by Virgo, Aries, Taurus, Aries. Eheieh by Air, Aries, Virgo, Aries; from Yeheshuah, the Qabalistic mode o f spelling Jesus. which is simply the Tetragrammaton, with the letter Shin placed therein, we obtain a v ery peculiar combination; Virgo, Aries, Fire, Taurus, A ries; Virgo born of a Virgin, Aries the Sacrificial Lamb; Fire the Fire of the Holy Spirit; Taurus the Ox of Earth, in whose manger he was laid; and lastl y Aries, the flocks of sheep whose herdsmen came to w orship him.

Returning to the spelling of Yeheshuah, it is e asy to see that the Lamb is an appropriate symbol of Je sus, from the prevalence of the Aries symbol, whose Fire is subdued and modified by its other associati ons. Hiero: Returns to his seat. Heg: Leads Practicus to West. Hiereus: In the Theoricus grade you were shown the lineal fi gures attributed to the planets. The figures as sho wn consist of the Dekagram, Endekagram and Dodekagram, together with the two forms of the Enneagram and the remaining forms of the Heptagram and Octogr am, which are not so consonant to the Planet. The Heptagram traced in a continuous figure, reflected from every third point, relates to the 7 planets. T he Octagram formed of two squares, to the eight letter ed Name. The two forms of the Enneagram refer to th e Triple Ternary. The three forms of the Dekagram rel ate to the duplicated Heh, to the Ten Sephiroth and to Malkuth. The three forms of the Endekagram are refe rred to the Qlippoth. The four forms of the Dodekagram are referred to the Zodiac, the three Qu aternions of angular, succedent, cadent and movable , fixed and common. the 4 Triplicities and the 24 thr ones of the Elders.

Heg: By the peculiar emblem of the Hegemon, which is the Calvary Cross of 6 squares within a circle."},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 150 Hiereus: This Cross embraces as you see Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod and Yesod and rests upon Malkuth. The surrounding circle includes Chesed, Geburah and Mal kuth. Also the Calvary Cross of 6 squares forms the cube, and is thus referred to the 6 Sephiroth of Mi croprosopus, which are Chesed, Geburah, Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod and Yesod. Heg: Resumes his seat. Hiero: Moves to West of Altar. Hiero: This is the symbolic representation of the Fall. Fo r the Great Goddess who in the Practicus Grade was supporting the columns of the Sephiroth in the form of the Sign of Theoricus being tempted by the Tree of Knowledge (whose branches indeed, tend upward in to the Seven lower Sephiroth, but also tend downwards into the Kingdom of the Shells) reached d own into the Qlippoth, and immediately the columns were unsupported, and the Sephirotic system was shattered, and with it fell Adam, the Microprosopus. Then arose the Great Dragon with 7 h eads and 10 horns, and the Garden was made desolate, and Malkuth was cut off from the upper Se phiroth by his intersecting folds, and linked unto the Kingdom of the Shells, and the 7 lower Sephiroth we re cut from the three Supernal in Daath; at the fee t of Aima Elohim. And on the heads of the Dragon are the Names and Crowns of the eight Edomite Kings, and upon the horns are the names of the 11 Dukes of Edom. And because in DAATH was the utmost rise of the Great Serpent of Evil, therefore is there as it were, another Sephira, making eight heads accor ding to the number of the 8 Kings. And for the Infernal and Averse Sephiroth 11 instead of 10, according to the number of the Dukes of Edom. And hence were the Riv ers of Eden desecrated, and from the mouth of the Dragon rushed the Infernal Waters in DAATH. And thi s is Leviathan, the piercing Serpent, even Leviathan, the Crooked Serpent. But between the dev astated Garden and the Supernal Eden, Tetragrammaton Elohim placed the letters of the Nam e and the Flaming Sword, that the uppermost part of the Tree of Life might not be involved in the Fall of Adam. And thence was it necessary that the Secon d Adam should come to restore all things and that the First Adam had been extended on the Cross of the Celestial Rivers, so the Son should be crucified on the Cross of the Infernal Rivers in Daath. Yet to do this he must descend unto the lowest first even unt o Malkuth and be born of her. The Grade of Philosophus is referred unto the Sephira Netzach an d the 27 th , 28 th , and 29 th Paths are bound thereto. The Sign of the Grade is given by raising the arms abov e the head making with the thumbs and fingers a triangle apex upwards. This represents the element of Fire, to which this Grade is attributed, and als o the Spirit which moved upon the Waters of Creation. The Grip or Token is the general grip of the First Ord er. The Grand Word is a name of nine letters Tetragramm aton Tzabaoth, which means the Lard of Armies. The mystic number is 28 and from it is formed the P ass Word of the Grade which is Koch (Kaph, Cheth) meaning Power. It should be lettered separately whe n given. Unto this Grade and unto the Sephira Netzach, the 7 th Path of the Sepher Yetzirah is referred. It is cal led the Recondite Intelligence and it is so called because it is the Refulgent Splendor of all the intellectual Virtues which are perceived by the Eyes of the Mind and by the contemplation of Faith. The distinguishing badge of this Grade, which you will now be entitled to wear, is the sash of a Practicus , with the addition of a bright green cross above t he violet cross and the numbers 4 and 7 within a circl e and a square respectively left and right of its s ummit, and below the number 37, the numbers 27, 28 and 29 in bright green between narrow parallel lines of th e same color. This Grade is especially referred unto the element of Fire and therefore the Great Watch Tower or Terrestrial Tablet of the South forms one of its principal emblems. Hiero: Pract: Move to the South.

The name answering to 7 is AHA, that an swering to 49 is HAGIEL, the Intelligence of Venus; that answering to 175 is Qedemei the Spirit of Venus and lastly that answering to 1252 is BENI SERAPHIM the name of the Intelligence of Venus. On this Tablet is shown the meaning of the symbol of Venus on the Tree of Life. It embraces all the Seph iroth, and is therefore the fitting symbol of the I sis of Nature. Hence also its circle is always represented larger than that of Mercury. Hiero: Resumes his seat. Heg: Leads Practicus to Hiereus. Heg: Hiereus: Pract: Move to West. Hiereus: On this Tablet (indicating it) are shown the Paths when arranged with DAATH added to the Sephirotic Tree. It differs from the other and more usual attr ibutions. Furthermore it is not so correct, as Daat h is not properly speaking, a Sephira. On this Tablet (indicating it) is shown the arrangement of the Sephiroth in the Four Worlds, each Sephira with its own 10 Sephi roth inscribed inside, so that the total number is 400, the number of Tau the last letter of the alphabet.

It is again, the Cross which heads the Pra emonstrator’s Wand, who represents the Sephira Chesed, the Fourth Sephira. Four is also the Number of Jupiter, whose Path unites Chesed to Netzach. The Cross is therefore a fit Emblem for the Grade o f Philosophus. In this diagram are represented the Circle, the Point, the Line, the Cross, the Square and the Cube. For the Circle is the Abyss, the Nothingness, the AIN. The Point is Kether. Now, the Point has no dimension, but in moving, it traces t he Line. This gives the first number, Unity, yet there in lies duality unmanifest, for two Points mark its ends. The movement of the line maketh the Plane or Square . The motion of the Point at angles to its first direction and intersecting it maketh the Cross. So therefore, are the Square and the Cross but one Symbol, deriving from the Circle and the Point. Bel ow, is shown the Occult Symbol of Malkuth, the Tenth Sephira. It is in Four parts, corresponding t o the Maltese Cross. They are Fire of Earth, Water of Earth, Air of Earth, Earth of Earth, as is indicate d by the Symbol. They correspond to the Four Grades of the First Order, which in one sense, quitteth not M alkuth, being the Grades of the Four Lowest Sephiro th of Malkuth in Assiah. Upon them, is surcharged a wh ite Hexagram in a Circle. The 6 and the 4 make 10, the number of Malkuth on the Tree. The Hexagram is also the Sign of the Macrocosm, of Tiphareth, and of the Six Upper Sephiroth, wherefore here it is wh ite, Spirit ruling over matter. Six is a perfect nu mber, for its whole equals the sum of its parts. Six are the middle points of the planes bounding a cube, wh ich derives from the square, and from the Cross, if the centre point moves. In these numbers and figures a re hid many revelations. Remember that the whole numbe r of Malkuth is 496, which is again a perfect number. Malkuth must then be equated and perfected by. the 6 ruling the 4, and the link between 6 and 4 is the number of the Pentagram. 2nd Ad: Having achieved the entry into Malkuth, it is needf ul that you should pass through the Path of Tau, the dark Path of the Astral Plane. Go, therefo re, to the Tablet of the East. (Phil. goes to East, Hiereus and Hegemon bar the wa y, points of implements downwards and touching. Hegemon demands Theoricus Sign and Words. Hiereus returns to place. Hegemon leads Philosophus to Tablet, gives Philosophus rose leave s, makes Cross over bowl and directs Philosophus to circumambulate repeating Names. Hegemon stands in T heoricus Sign while Philosophus traverses Path of Tau in the Names of Shaddai El Chai, Raphael, ORO IBAH AOZPI and Bataivah. Philosophus returns to East. Hegemon makes invoking Pentagram a nd directs Philosophus to uncover Lamp. Hegemon takes Philosophus to Altar and directs him to put Rose leaves at East side, then standing East of the Altar in Yesod, Hegemon shows Great Hermetic Arcanum.)

The Dragon issuing from the cave represents volcanic fires. (Heg. leads Phil. once r ound, and hands him over to Hiereus in the North an d returns to place.) Hiereus: This is the Image of the Vision of Nebuchadnezzar, which was showed you in the passage of the 27th Path, leading to the Grade of Philosophus. Tho u, 0 King, sawest and beheld a great image. This Great Image, whose brightness was excellent stood b efore thee and the form thereof was terrible. This Image’s head was pure gold, his breast and his arms were silver, his belly and his thighs were brass, his legs of iron and his feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out wit hout hands, which smote the Image upon its feet, which w ere part of iron and part of clay. And brake them t o pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver and the Gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floor s; and the wind carried them away and no place was found for them; and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. Thou, 0 King, art a King of Kings, for the God in heaven ha th given unto thee (makes Qabalistic Cross) the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory! Thou art this head of Gold. (to Phil.) Thou art thi s head of Gold! Thy head represents in thee the dominion of the Divine ruling over the rest of the body. The Silver is the world of the heart, the bra ss is the material passion, the iron is the firm purpose, and the feet, part of iron and part of clay, are t he mingled strength and infirmity of the natural man. And the Stone made without hands is the Eternal Stone of the Wise, which will become the Mountain o f Initiation, whereby the whole Earth shall be fill ed with the knowledge of God. (Hiereus takes Philosoph us to second diagram.) Hiereus: This Tablet shows the symbolic manner in which cert ain names have been used by our ancient brethren. You will note that the initials of this s entence make the Latin word Vitriolum, Sulphuric ac id. Furthermore, the word Vitriol, Sulphur, and Mercury each consist of seven letters answering to the alchemic powers of the seven Planets. The initials of the following sentence in Latin, the subtil flui d, the Light of the Earth, make the word S.A.L.T.salt, and further, the four words of the sentence answer to the four Elements: Subtilis, Air; Aqua, Water; Lux, Fire; and Terra, E arth. And the four words united yield 20 letters, that is, the product of four, the number o f the Elements, multiplied by Five, the number of t he Pentagram. The words Fiat Lux, meaning Let there by Light, consist of 7 letters. The letters of Fiat f orm the initials of Flatis, Air; Aqua, Water; Ignus, Fi re; and Terra, Earth. (Hegemon goes to South).

(2nd Ad. takes Phil osophus to Tarot Key of Death.) 2nd Ad: The 13th Key of Tarot represents the figure of a Sk eleton, upon which some portions of flesh still remain. In a field he is reaping off with the Scythe of Death the fresh vegetation which springs from corrupting bodies buried therein, fragments of whic h such as hands, heads and feet appear above the so il. Bones also are strewn upon the surface. One of the heads wears a kingly crown; another is apparently that of a person of little note, showing that Death is the equalizer of all conditions. The five extre mities, the head, hands and feet, allude to the powers of t he number five, the Letter Heh, the Pentagram, the concealed Spirit of Life and the Four Elements, the originator of all living form. The Sign of Scorpio especially alludes to stagnant and foetid water, th at property of the moist nature which initiates putrefaction and decay.

This is further shown by the figure itself putrifying and decaying as it reaps the grass of the field. As for man, his days are as grass, as a flower of the fie ld, so he flourisheth. The top of the scythe forms the Tau Cr oss of Life, showing that what destroys also renews . The whole is a representation of the eternal transm utation of the life of nature, which reforms all th ings into fresh images and similitUdes. This symbol repr esents the corrosive and destructive action of the infernal Fire as opposed to the Celestial, the Drag on of the Waters, the Typhon of the Egyptians, the Slayer of Osiris, which later yet rises again in Ho rus. The Scorpion, Serpent of Evil, delineated befo re the figure of Death in the more ancient form of the Key, refers to the mixed and transforming, therefo re deceptive, nature of this emblem. Behind him, is th e Symbol of the Nameless One, representing the Seed and its germ, not yet differentiated into Life, the refore incapable of definition. The Scorpion is the emblem of ruthless destruction. The Snake is the mi xed and deceptive nature, serving alike for good an d evil.

Great ind eed, and many are the mysteries of this terrible Key. (2nd Ad. and Hiereus show Philosophus the figure of Typhon.) Hiereus: This drawing represents the symbolic figure of Typh on, the Destroyer. The eleven circles represent the eleven Averse Sephiroth. He stands up on Earth and Ocean, his head lost in the clouds, a colossal image of evil and destruction. The brow de notes the confusion of opposing Elemental Forces in the higher regions of the Air, and confusion of min d and madness in man. The eyes are the devouring flames of lust and violence, the breath is storm, d evastation and rage, alike in the Universe which is the greater world, and in Man who is the lesser. The ar ms and the hands are the swift executors of evil works, the bringers of pestilence and disease. The heart is malice and envy in man, the nourisher of e vil in the atmosphere, which later are again symbolised by the numerous and twining serpents. 2nd Ad: The 24th Path of Sepher Yetzirah to which the Tarot Key of Death is referred is the Imaginative Intelligence, and it is so called because it giveth form to all similitudes which are created in like manner similar to its harmonious elegances.

I n his left hand, which points downwards, he holds a l ighted torch, and in his right, which is elevated, a horn of water. The left hand points downwards to sh ow that it is the infernal and burning, not the celestial and life-giving flame which is kindled in his torch, just as when the Sun is in Capricornus, to which cold and earthy Sign this Key corresponds, So lar light is at its weakest and the natures of cold and moisture triumph over heat and dryness.

Of the smaller demons, one points downwards and one upwards, answering to the positions of the hands of the central figures. Beneath his feet are Pentagrams on which he tramples (whence comes their title of Wizard’s foot) and his head is cover ed with the evil and reversed Pentagram. As his han ds bear the torch and the horn, the symbols of Fire an d Water, so does his form unite the Earth in his ha iry and bestial aspect, and the Air in his bat-like win gs. Thus he represents the gross and materialized Elemental Forces of Nature; and the whole would be an evil symbol were it not for the Pentagram of Light above his head which regulates and guides his movements. He is the eternal renewer of all the changing forms of Creation in conformity with the L aw of the All Powerful One, Blessed be He, which controlling law is typified by the controlling Pent agram of Light surmounting the whole. This Key is an emblem of tremendous force; many and universal are its mysteries. (Hiereus and 3rd Ad. go to diagram of Pan.) Hiereus: This drawing represents the symbolic figure of Pan, the Greek God of Nature. He stands upon the Cube of the Universe, holding in his right hand the pastoral staff of rural authority, and in his left the 7 reeded pipe symbolical of the harmony of the Plan etary Spheres. The Nine Circles represent the Sephiroth with the exception of Kether, exactly tho se which are included in the symbol on the Tree of Life. The ruddy face is the heat of the Earth, the horns are the Rays, the body contains the Elements and the Cube is the firm basis. Observe that the higher part of the figure is human, growing more bestial as it nears the Earth. 3rd Ad: The 26th Path of the Sepher Yetzirah, to which the Tarot Key of the Devil is referred, is called the Renovating Intelligence, because, by it, God th e Holy One reneweth all the changing forms which are renewed by the Creation of the World.

Ad: This drawing represents the more ancient form of th e 14th Key of Tarot, for which the later and more usual form of Temperance was soon substituted, as better representing the natural symbolism of the Path Sagittarius. The earler figure was conside red not so much a representation of this Path alone , as the synthesis of that and the others conjoined. The later figure, therefore, is better adapted to the more restricted meaning. The more ancient form shows a f emale figure crowned with the crown of five rays, symbolising the Five Principles of Nature, the conc ealed Spirit and the Four Elements of Earth, Air, Water and Fire. About her head is a halo of light. On her breast is the Sun of Tiphareth. The Five-ray ed Crown further alludes to the Five Sephiroth Kether, Chokmah, Binah, Chesed and Geburah. Chained to her waist are a Lion and an Eagle, between which is a large cauldron whence arise steam and smoke. The Lion represents the Fire in Netzach - the Blood of the Lion, and the Eagle represents the Water in Hod , the Gluten of the Eagle whose reconciliation is mad e by the Air in Yesod, uniting with the volatilised Water arising from the cauldron through the influen ce of the Fire beneath it. The chains which link th e Lion and the Eagle to her waist, are symbolic of th e Paths of Scorpio and Capricornus as shown by the Scorpion and the Goat in the background. In her rig ht hand, she bears the Torch of Solar Fire elevatin g and volatilising the Water in Hod by the fiery infl uence of Geburah, while with her left hand, she pou rs from a vase the Waters of Chesed to temperate and c alm the Fires of Netzach. This later form is the usual figure of Temperance, symbolising in a more r estricted form than the preceding, the peculiar properties of this Path. It represents an Angel wit h the Solar emblem of Tiphareth on her brow, and wings of the aerial and volatilising nature, pourin g together the fluidic Fire and the fiery Water thu s combining, harmonising and tempering those opposing elements. One foot rests on dry and volcanic land, in the bac kground of which is a volcano whence issues an eruption. The other foot is in the water by whos e border springs fresh vegetation, contrasting stro ngly with the arid and dry nature of the distant land. O n her breast is a square, the emblem of rectitude. The whole figure is a representation of that straight a nd narrow way of which it is said “few there be tha t find it” which alone leads to the higher and glorified l ife. For to pursue that steady and tranquil mean be tween two opposing forces, is indeed difficult, and many are the temptations to turn aside either to the rig ht or to the left wherein, remember, are but to be found the menacing symbols of Death and the Devil. The 25th Path of the Sepher Yetzirah to which the T arot Key of Temperance is referred, is called the Intelligence of Probation, and it is so called because it is the primary temptation by which the C reator tries all righteous person. That is, that in it, th ere is ever present the temptation to turn aside to the one hand or to the other. (2nd and 3rd Ad. give Cup and red lamp to Phil. who holds them in form of Tau Cross.) Ch.

As it is said “Stoop not down, for a precipice lieth beneath the Earth - a d escent of seven steps; and therein, is established the throne of an evil and fatal force. Stoop not down u nto that dark and lurid w rid. Defile not thy brill iant flame with the earthy dross of matter.

Ad: Seeing that you are now Lord of the Paths of the Po rtal of the Vault of the Adepti, and are entered into the Second Degree, approaching the Sec ond or Inner Order, it is fitting that you should h ave the knowledge of these emblems to complete as far a s may be, your understanding of the Powers of the Officers of the First or Outer Order. Both refer in natural succession of numbers to the six following the five. Thus all progress is by steps, gradual and se cure. The inner revelation may come suddenly to som e, even in the twinkling of an eye or it may be after long waiting - a slow and gradual process from the beginning, yet ever the liquid must be prepared to the point of saturation. The Hierophant’s Lamen is a synthesis of Tiphareth, to which the Calvary Cross of six squares, forming the cube opened out, is fitly referred. The two colours, red and green the most active and the most passive, whose conjunction points out the prac tical application of the knowledge of equilibrium, are symbolic of the reconciliation of the celestial essences of Fire and Water, for the reconciling ye llow unites with blue in green, which is the complementa ry colour to red, and with red in orange which is t he complementary colour to blue. The small inner circl e placed upon the Cross alludes to the Rose that is conjoined therewith in the symbolism of the Rose an d Cross of our Order. The field of the Banner of the East is White, the c olour of light and purity. As in the previous case, the Calvary Cross of six squares is the numbe r six of Tiphareth, the yellow Cross of Solar Gold, and the cubical stone bearing in its centre the sac red Tau of Life, and having bound together upon it the form of the Macrocosmic Hexagram, the red triangle of Fire and the blue triangle of Water - the Ruach Elohim and the Waters of Creation. The six angles o f the Hexagram described upon the Tree of Life will give the Planets referred to it as follows: Daath, Saturn; Chesed, Jupiter; Geburah, Mars; Netzach, Venus; Hod, Mercury; Yesod, Luna; while in the cent re is the Sun of Tiphareth. Upon my breast is a symbol, which, 0 Lord of the Pa ths of the Portal of the Adepti, is as yet unknown to you.

Very Honored Frater Hodos Chameli onis, remove from the Aspirant the Chain of Humility and the Robe of Mourning, and re-invest hi m with the Crossed Sashes. (Done) 3rd Ad: Know, then, O Aspirant, that the Mysteries of the R ose and the Cross have existed from time immemorial, and that the Rites were practiced, and the Wisdom taught, in Egypt, Eleusis, Samothrace, Persia, Chaldea and India, and in far more ancient lands. The story of the introduction of these myste ries into mediaeval Europe has thus been handed down to us. In 1378 was born the Chief and originator of our Fraternity in Europe. He was of a noble German family, but poor, and in the fifth year of his age was placed in a cloister where he learned both Greek an d Latin. While yet a youth he accompanied a certain brother P.A.L. on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, bu t the latter, dying at Cyprus, he himself went to Damascus. There was then in Arabia a Temple of the Order which was called in the Hebrew tongue \"Damkar\", that is The Blood of the Lamb. There he w as duly initiated and took the Mystic title Christi an Rosenkreutz, or Christian of the Rosy Cross. He the n so far improved his knowledge of the Arabian tongue that in the following year he translated the book \"M\" into Latin, which he afterwards brought back with him to Europe. After three years he went on into Egypt, where there was another Temple of the Order. There he remained for a time still study ing the mysteries of Nature. After this, he travele d by"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 44 sea to the city of Fessa, where he was welcomed at the Temple there established. and he there obtained the knowledge and the acquaintance of the habitants of the Elements, who revealed unto him many of their secrets. Of the Fraternity he confessed that they had not retained their Wisdom in its primal pu rity, and that their Kabala was to a certain extent alter ed to their religion. Nevertheless, he learned much there. After a stay of two years he came to Spain, where he endeavored to reform the errors of the learned according to the pure knowledge he had rece ived. But it was to them a laughing matter, and the y reviled and rejected him, even as the prophets of o ld were rejected. Thus also was he treated by those of his own and other nations when he showed them the e rrors that had crept into their religions. So, afte r five years residence in Germany, he initiated three of his former monastic brethren, Fraters G.W., I.A ., and I.O., who had more knowledge than many others a t that time. And by these four was made the foundation of the Fraternity in Europe. These worke d and studied at the writings and other knowledge which C.R.C. had brought with him, and by them was some of the Magical Language transcribed (which is that of the Elemental Tablets) and a Dictionary thereof made; and the Rituals and part of the Book \"M\" were transcribed. For the True Order of the Ros e Cross descendeth into the depths, and ascendeth into the heights, even unto the Throne of God Himsel f, and includeth even Archangels, Angels and Spirits. These four Fraters also erected a building to serve for the Temple and Headquarters of their Order, and called it the Collegium ad Spiritum Sanc tum, or the College of the Holy Spirit. This being now finished, and the work of establishing the Orde r extremely heavy, and because they devoted much time to the healing of those sick and possessed, wh o resorted to them, they initiated four others, viz .: Fraters R.C. (the son of the deceased father's brot her of C.R.C.), C.B. a skilful artist, B.C., and P. D., who was to be Cancellarius; all being Germans except I. A., and now eight in number. Their agreement was: 1. That none of them should profess any other thing, than but to cure the sick, and that freely. 2. That they should not be constrained to wear any d istinctive dress, but there in follow the custom of the country. 3. That every year on the day of Corpus Christi, the y should meet at the Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum, or write the cause o f absence. 4. Every one should look for some worthy person of e ither sex, who after his decease might succeed him. 5. The word R.C. to be their mark, seal, and charact er. The Fraternity to remain secret for one hundred yea rs. Five of the Fraters were to travel in different countries, and two were to remain with Ch ristian Rosenkreutz. 2nd Ad: Frater I.O. was the first to die, and then in Engla nd where he had wrought many wonderful cures. He was an expert Kabbalist as his book \"H\" witnesseth. His death had been previously foretold him by C.R.C. but those who were later admitted were of th e First Order, and knew not when C.R. died, and save what they learned from Frater A., the successo r of D. of the Second Order and from their library after his death, knew little of the earlier and hig her Members, and of the Founder, nor yet whether th ose of the Second Order were admitted to the Wisdom of the highest members. The discovery then of the Tomb wherein that highly illuminated Man of God, ou r Father C.R.C., was buried occurred as follows."},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"VOLUME SEVEN 45 After Frater A. died in Gallia Narbonensi, there su cceeded in his place Frater N.N. He, while repairin g a part of the building of the College of the Holy Spi rit, endeavored to remove a brass memorial tablet which bore the names of certain brethren, and some other things. In this tablet was the head of a stro ng nail or bolt, so that when the tablet was forcibly wrenched away it pulled with it a large stone which thus partially uncovered a secret door, (he draws back c urtain, revealing door), upon which was inscribed i n large letters Post CXX Annos Patebo -- After an hun dred and twenty years I shall open, with the year o f our Lord under, 1484. Frater N.N., and those with h im then cleared away the rest of the brickwork, but let it remain that night unopened as they wished fi rst to consult the ROTA. 3rd Ad: You will now quit the Portal for a short time, and on your return the Ceremony of Opening the Tomb will be proceeded with.

He is placed in front of and facing Vault Door. 2nd Ad: Before the Door of the Tomb, as symbolic Guardians, are the Elemental Tablets, and the Kerubic Emblems, even as before the mystical Gate of Eden s tood the watchful Kerubim, and the Sword of Flame. These Kerubic Emblems be the powers of the A ngles of the Tablets. The Circle represents the four Angles bound together in each Tablet through t he operation of the all pervading Spirit, while the Cross within forms with its spokes the Wheels of Ez ekiel's Vision; and therefore are the Cross and the Circle white to represent the purity of the Divine Spirit. And inasmuch as we do not find the Elements unmixed, but each bound together with each -- so th at in the Air we find not only that which is subtle and tenuous, but also the qualities of heat, moistu re and dryness, bound together in that all-wanderin g Element; and further also that in Fire, Water and E arth we find the same mixture of Nature -- therefor e the Four Elements are bound to each Kerubic Emblem counterchanged with the color of the Element wherein they operate; even as in the Vision of Ezek iel each Kerub had four faces and four wings. Forge t not therefore that the Tablets and the Kerubim are the Guardians of the Tomb of the Adepti. Let thy tongue keep silence on our mysteries. Restrain even the thought of thy heart lest a bird of the air ca rry the matter. 3rd Ad: Upon more closely examining the Door of the Tomb, y ou will perceive, even as Frater N.N., and those with him did perceive, that beneath the CXX in the inscription were placed the characters IX thus: POST CXX ANNOS PATEBO IX This being equivalent to Post Annos Lux Crucis Pate bo - At the end of 120 years, I, the Light of the Cross, will disclose myself. For the letters fo rming LVX are made from the dismembered and conjoined angles of the Cross; and 120 is the produ ct of the numbers from 1 to 5, multiplied in regula r progression, which number five is symbolized in the Cross with four extremities and one center point. 2nd Ad: On the following morning, Frater N.N. and his compa nions forced open the door (he opens it wide) and there appeared to their sight a Tomb of Seven Sides and Seven Corners. Every side was five feet broad, and eight feet high, even as the same is faithfully represented before you. 2nd Ad: Enters and passes by North to East of Vault, and tu rns to face West. 3rd Ad: Places Aspirant on North facing South, and takes hi s place at South facing North. 2nd Ad: Although in the Tomb the Sun does not shine, it is lit by the symbolic Rose of our Order in the center of"},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 48 the first heptagonal ceiling. In the midst of the T omb stands a circular Altar with these devices and descriptions on it: A.G. R.C., Ad Gloriam Roseae Cr ucis. A.C.R.G., Ad Crucis Rosae Gloriam. Hoc Universal Compendium Unius Mihi Sepulchrum Feci. Un to the Glory of the Rose Cross I have constructed this Tomb for myself as a Compendium of the Universal Unity. Within the next circle is written: Yeheshuah Mihi Omnia, Yeheshuah is all thi ngs to me. In the center are four figures of the Kerubim enclosed within circles surrounded by the f ollowing four inscriptions and each distinguished b y one of the letters of the Tetragrammaton: Yod, Lion Nequaquam Vacuum, Nowhere a Void. Heh, Eagle, Libertas Evangelii, Liberty of the Gospel. Vau, Man , Dei Intacta Gloria, Unsullied Glory of God. Heh (f), Ox, Legis Jugum, Yoke of the Law. And in the m idst of all is Shin, the Letter of the Spirit formi ng thus the Divine Name Yeheshuah, from the Tetragramm aton. Therefore, by God's Grace, having come thus far, let us kneel down together, and say: All kneel, joining wands above Altar. 2nd Ad: Unto Thee, Sole Wise, Sole Mighty and Sole Eternal One, be praise and Glory forever, Who has permitted this Aspirant who now kneeleth before The e to penetrate thus far into the Sanctuary of Thy Mysteries. Not unto us, but unto Thy Name be the Gl ory. Let the influence of Thy Divine Ones descend upon his head, and teach him the value of self-sacr ifice, so that he shrink not in the hour of trial, but that thus his name may be written on high, and that his Genius may stand in the presence of the Holy Ones, in that hour when the Son of Man is invoked before the Lord of Spirits and His Name in the presence of the Ancient of Days. It is written: If any man will come after Me, let him take up his cross, and deny himself, and follow Me. 3rd Ad: Hands Chain to Aspirant, and takes Wand and Cross f rom him. 2nd Ad: Take therefore this Chain, O Aspirant, and place it about thy neck and say: I accept the Bonds of Suffering and Self-Sacrifice. 2nd Ad: 3rd Ad: Rise.

Like Him, O Adepts of all ages, have ye toiled. Like Him have ye suffered tribulation. Pove rty, torture and death have ye passed through. They have been but the purification of the Gold. In the alembic of thine heart, through the athanor of affl iction, seek thou the true stone of the Wise. Aspirant: Gives Wand and Crux to Chief Adept. Ch. Ad: Gives in exchange the Crook and Scourge. Ch. Ad: Quit then, this Tomb, O Aspirant, with thine arms c rossed upon thy breast, bearing in thy right hand t he Crook of Mercy and in thy left the Scourge of Sever ity, the emblems of those Eternal Forces betwixt which the equilibrium of the Universe dependeth; th ose forces whose reconciliation is the Key of Life, whose separation is evil and death. Therefore thou art inexcusable, whosoever thou art, that judgest another, for in that thou condemnest another, thou condemnest but thyself. Be thou therefore merciful, even as thy Father who is in Heaven is merciful. Re member that tremendous Obligation of rectitude and self-sacrifice which thou hast voluntarily taken up on thyself, and tremble thereat. And let the humble prayer of thy heart be: God, be merciful to me a si nner, and keep me in the pathway of Truth. 3rd Ad: Thus, then, did Frater N.

But the colors of the 22 Paths are derived from and find th eir roots in those of the First Reflected Triad of t he Sephiroth, the Three Supernals not otherwise enteri ng into their composition, and thus are their posit ive colors found. Unto the Air is ascribed the Yellow c olor of Tiphareth. Unto the Water is ascribed the B lue Color of Chesed. Unto the Fire is ascribed the Red Color of Geburah. The colors are to be found in Malkuth. Those of the Planets are in the Rainbow sc ale-, thus: Saturn, Indigo; Jupiter, Violet; Mars, Red; Sol, Orange; Mercury, Yellow; Venus, Green; Luna, B lue. Unto the Signs of the Zodiac are ascribed the following: Aries, Scarlet; Taurus, Red-Orange; Gemi ni, Orange; Cancer, Amber; Leo, Greenish-Yellow; Virgo, Yellowish-Green; Libra, Emerald; Scorpio, Gr eenish-Blue; Sagittarius, Blue; Capricornus, Indigo; Aquarius, Purple; Pisces, Crimson. Further, thou wilt observe that the colors of the Paths and the Sephiroth form a mutual balance and harmony on the Tree. Colors are Forces, the Signatures of the Forces; and the Child of the children of the Forces art thou. And therefore about the Throne of the Mighty One is a Rainbow of Glory, and at His Feet i s the Crystal Sea. But there are many other attributions of color also, seeing that the respect ive rays meet and blend with each other. And theref ore do I greet thee with the Mystic Title of Hodos Cham elionis, the Path of the Chameleon, the Path of Mixed Colors, and I greet thee the Symbol of Hiddek el, the third River which floweth towards the East of Assiah. They return to Altar. and 2nd Adept indicates Crook and Scourge thereon. 2nd Ad: The colors of the Crook and Scourge are taken from those of the Minutum Mundum Diagram, and they thus represent the just equilibrium between Mercy a nd Severity on the Tree of Life. The Crook therefore is divided into the colors Symbolic of: Kether, Alep h, Chokmah, Taurus, Chesed, Leo, Tiphareth, Aries,"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"VOLUME SEVEN 55 Hod, Capricornus. And the Scourge into those symbol izing: Netzach, Scorpio, Tiphareth, Gemini, Binah, Cancer, Geburah, Mem. 3rd Ad: (Indicates Sword and Serpent.) The colors of the Minutum Mundum are also the key to those which compose the Admission Badge of the Sword and Serpen t; and thus by their aid it may be the better examined and comprehended. The one is ascending, th e other is descending; the one is fixed, the other is volatile; the one unites the Sephiroth, the other t he Paths. Furthermore, in the Serpent of Wisdom is shown the ascending Spiral, and in the Sword the ru sh of the descending White Brilliance from beyond Kether, differentiated into various shades and colo rs, darkening more and more as they near Malkuth. Ch. Ad: (Indicates Diagram of Mountain.) This is the symbolic Mountain of God in the center of the Universe, the sacred Rosicrucian Mountain of Initiation, the Mystic Mountain of Abiegnus. Below and around it are darkness and silence, and it is crowned with th e Light ineffable. At its base is the Wall of Enclo sure and Secrecy, whose sole Gateway, invisible to the p rofane, is formed of the Two Pillars of Hermes. The ascent of the Mountain is by the Spiral path of the Serpent of Wisdom. Stumbling on between the Pillar s is a blindfolded figure, representing the Neophyte, whose ignorance and worthlessness while only in th at Grade is shown by the 0 = 0, and whose sole future claim to notice and recognition by the Order is the fact of his having entered the Pathway to the other Grades, until at length he attains to the summit. I now proceed to instruct you in the mystic symbolism of the tomb itself. Let the Altar be moved aside. (Done.) It is divided into three parts, the Ceiling which i s White; the Heptagonal Walls of seven Rainbow colo rs, and the Floor whose prevailing hue is black; thus s howing the powers of the Heptad between the Light and the Darkness. On the ceiling is a Triangle encl osing a Rose of 22 petals, within a Heptangle forme d of a Heptagram reflected from the Seven Angles of t he Wall. The Triangle represents the Three Supernal Sephiroth; the Heptagram, the Lower Seven; the Rose represents the 22 paths of the Serpent of Wisdom. The Floor has upon it also the Symbol of a Triangle enclosed within a Heptagram, bearing the titles of the Averse and Evil Sephiroth of the Qlippoth, the Great Red Dragon of Seven Heads, and the inverted and evil triangle. And thus in the Tomb of the Adep ti do we tread down the Evil Powers of the Red Dragon (Chief Adept stamps thrice on diagram) and so tread thou upon the evil powers of thy natu re. For there is traced within the evil Triangle the Re scuing Symbol of the Golden Cross united to the Red Rose of Seven times Seven Petals.

But the whiteness above shines the brighter f or the Blackness which is beneath, and I helpeth forward the Good. And between the thus mayest thou comprehend that the evil Light and that Darkness vibrate the Colors of the Rainbow, whose crossed an d reflected rays, under the Planetary presidency ar e shewn forth in these Seven Walls. Remember that thou hast entered by the door of the Planet Venus, whose symbol includes the whole Ten Sephiroth of the Tree of Life. Each Wall of the Tomb is said mystically to be in breadth fiv e feet and in height eight feet, thus yielding forty squares, of which ten are marked and salient, representing the Ten Sephiroth in the form of the T ree of Life, acting throughout the Planet. The remaining squares represent the Kerubim and the Ete rnal Spirit, the Three Alchemical Principles, the Three Elements, the Seven Planets, and the Twelve S igns, all operating in and differentiating the rays of each planet. Note that in all, the Central Upper sq uare alone remains white and unchanged, representin g the changeless Essence of the Divine Spirit, thus d eveloping all from the One, through the Many under the government of One. The colors of the varying sq uares may be either represented by the color of the Planet and the color of the Force therein mixed tog ether, or by these colors being placed in juxtaposi tion, or in any other convenient manner; but the foundati on of them all is the Minutum Mundum Diagram.

"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 62 THE F ELLOWSHIP OF THE ROSY CROSS At this juncture, I would like very much to present three rituals written by Arthur Edward Waite for his own Order which he called T he Fellowship of the Rosy Cross. As might he expected the text is Christian and biblica l. Waite was raised a Roman Catholic. It is alsc classical Waite in that he was compelled to insert quite frequently Latin phrases which, from the ritualistic viewpoint, is not a bad idea since a strange tongue may excite the inner sense of wonder and worship. In ritual it is excusable. In prose it is unforgivable - at least to the extent that it is used by Waite in his various writings. It is also typical Waite in that it is ponderous, t urgid and repetitive. I am no great advocate or admirer of Waite's literary output. He had so much to say in reality, but his literary style got in the way to obscure his messag e. Yet, in these rituals of the Neophyte, Adeptus Mino r and Major grades, given me through the courtesy of Robert W. Gilbert of Bristo l who is writing a biography of Waite, I have found myself strangely moved. It is rather lik e being escorted through the Adeptus Minor ritual again, though this time to the tune of another melody, in the language of another day, in the spirit of another religion. In spite of my own resistance to Waite, I find myself choked a little, tearful of eye, exalted in spirit as I was fifty years ago. T his is a remarkable admission of the efficacy not merely of ritual per se but of what I would otherwise have stamped as pompous, flatulent, turgi d bible - thump ing which I dislike heartily. There are some magnificent lines in here. In the ev ent that some of my readers may wish to institute a new Golden Dawn temple, many of these lines could well be incorporated into the ancient rituals. In the event that some already initiated members of the Order are desirous of so- called higher grades, Waite's Adeptus Major Ritualm ight provide some basic features which could be incorporated into what they know of the conventional Order Rituals.

Yo ur pre par ati on as a Candidate was in the body, to symbolise that greate r preparation which you had already made in your heart before you could be accepted as a Postulant. The triple cord which was placed about you represented the threefold bondage of your mortality, and when it was in fine loosed this signified the liberation of your h igher part. The sacramental title which you h a ve as su me d i n pl ace o f your eart hl y de si gnat io n i s a t o ken of o ur S ec ret Na me in t he Temple that is above: it is the nearest that you ca n reach in your aspiration to that which in this life is hidden even from yo urself. T he hoodwin k ima ged the darkness of the material mind. The censing in your several consecrations pre figured the cleansing with fire from the Supernal Altar of Incense. May your heart and your reins be purified thereby as if with a burning coal. The cross-marking with lustral water and the mystic sprinkling showed forth sacramentally the condition on which your name is r egistered in the Book of Life. The Altar at which you knelt is in the form of a double cube, with its base of necessity concealed, the surfaces exposed to sight, while on the summit are the sacred emblems whereon you were pledged and whereby you are bound in the sight of G od henceforth and forever.

At the apex of the White Triang le, there is placed a Red Cross, which is the sign of Him who is unfolded in light through th e universe and through the soul in grace.

May the p ower and perfection of its fulness be as the glory of the King of all. (The Hierophant resum es his seat.) Hierophant. To the East of the Cubical Altar are the Pillars wh ich are analogically referred to Seth, Hermes and Solomon as allusions to the secret tradition and its perpetuation by the guardians of the Mysteries. They bear certain hiero glyphical texts from the Ritual of the Dead. T hey are symbols of eternal equilibrium, acti ve and passive, fixed and volatile, severity and mercy. The solid triangles on their su mmits bear each a veiled lamp, signifying the triad of life. Between them lies the narrow pat h of the Hidden Wisdom. It was down this path, my brother, that I passed for your reintegrat ion in the light; on the threshold thereof, and between the Iwo Pillars, you received the secre ts of the Grade, the distinguishing badge and the final and perfect consecration. You should now learn that the Hierophant on his Thr one in the East personifies the substance and the evidence and the experience which are represented by faith in the eternal. He is the Rising Sun in Nature and power, light, me rcy and wisdom in the providential world. It is said: Ex oriente Lux, and that light i s for the illumination of the peoples of the earth. Behold He hath placed His Tabernacle in the sun, and the purpose is that our feet may be directed in the way of peace. T his is how th e Orient from on high visits us. T he intention is furthermore that the knowledge of salv ation may be granted to His people. This is the import of the power of the Hierophant and th e correspondence thereof is His mercy, for mercy is on all sides. But the correspondence o f his light is his wisdom, and this wisdom symbolises that which proceeds from the mouth of th e Most High, reaching from end to end and strongly and sweetly overruling all things. The Hierophant is also the teaching spirit at the place of the Rending of the Veil. The Hiereus on the Throne of the West is the Settin g Sun in Nature and Divine Fortitude in the world of Providence. But the Forti tude of God on the threshold of initiation is the power and will to save the soul alive when i t has gone forth seeking the true light. That is the kind of Fortitude. The Hiereus is also a cor respondence of that Divine Darkness which is behind all manifested Divine Light. The Hegemon represents religion, the foundation of which is in faith, but it is also holy hope. He is the Mediator, the Reconciler, the Preparer for the Path to the Divine. He represents in an especial manner the condition of t he ascent of the soul, and that is purity, which is symbolised by his white robe. It is in and by this quality that he directs the higher aspirations of the spirit. Purity is not only the c ondition, but in a sense it is also the term; it"},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"VOLUME SEVEN 85 is not only the first link in the chain which leads from earth to heaven, but it is the chain itself. It is the Ladder of Jacob, by which t he aspirations ascend and the great influences come down. It is said that Religion pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this: To visit the fatherless and the widowed in their affliction and to keep oneself unspotted from the world. The Hegemon coming forth from between the Pillars, and going even outside the d oor of th e T e mp le i nto t he p lac e of th e uni niti ated , is se nt to s a ve t hat wh ich is in dereliction. His ministry is to those w ho are widowed of the Divine Spouse and to those who are fatherless, being without God in t he world. When he goes out therefore, it is as if a voice s aid: An d Go d so l o ve d the wo rld. But the qualities and graces and virtues which are represented by the chief officers are in a state of superincession. T here is also a sense in which the Hierophant and Hiereus both represent the love that is behind the universe, in virtue of the correspondences of which it is possible for God to he so near the heart of man tha t it is more easy to attain than to miss Hi m.

We trust also that the Order may become to you one of those hearths and homes around which the love of brotherhood is gathered - that love whi ch does not fail us in the hour of inward need. In this respect we are pledged to you whom we have admitted, as you are pledged to us: we ask you to remember this, as we also remembe r, and among the last things which we"},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"VOLUME SEVEN 87 can offer to you at this time is the maxim in chief of fraternity founded on consanguinity of spirit; Brother, the keys of all t he greater mysteries are committed to the hands of love. And now as regards the experience through which you have just passed, we have no occasion to remind you that in the physical order w e come forth from darkness into light, and that in the intellectual order most comparisons bet ween light and darkness are an ecomony of our real meaning. The progress of the Candidate from the one to the other state in the Grade of Neophyte is understood among us in a parti cular sense, which at the same time has a certain natural analogy with the more usual meani ng. The birth of the soul in our consciousness is like birth into physical life. As the life of the Candidate anteceded his reception into the Order, so the soul which is with in us antecedes that mo ment when it issues, as it were, from its concealment within us and begins to manifest by its operation. This is the beginning of the supernatural life, of the life of grace, and hereof is the whole Grade a symbol. When the desire of the House of the Lord awakens within us, our passage from darkness has already begun; we have been calle d to the Living Beauty; that which is termed among us the Lamp of the Hidden Knowledge ha s been uplifted and proceeds before us on the way; it is the experience of those who ar e our precursors in the ascent of the Holy Mountain. Through the keen air of high aspiration, as in the uplifted region of the mind, may we pass into that world of flame, wherein are t he Sons and Daughters of Desire! When desire and aspiration have attained their term in u s, may there be communicated at length that bread and even that salt which are types of th e earth no longer but the food of souls! May we drink of that wine reserved for those who ar e athirst in the Kingdom of our Father! T he lustrations are many, and the consecrations als o are many, looking for that time when God shall cleanse us from our sins with living wate r, pouring through the chambers of the mind, and our hearts with that fire which being enk indled on earth shall in the end carry us to heaven. We are dealing, Brethren, and shall continue to dea l henceforward, not alone with the question of religion, but with its heart and ce ntre behind all the external differences of systems and churches and sects. The Grades of the O rder of the Golden Dawn are the grades of our progression in God, and in these - as in those which we take in that other and not less symbolical progression of daily life - it rests with us whether they shall remain symbolism or whether we shall pass in them, and the y shall pass in us. into the actual region of experience. It is because of that infinite realm which lies behind the woven circle of of ficial religion that you are counselled in this Gra de to respect the forms thereof. T he external churches are doors which open for many if not indeed for you, and there is perchance one of them which for you also may open, into the places of peace, into the light which in fine will enlighten every man who comes in to this world. Looking unto which region, and remembering the term of our desire, let us pray that we all who are inheritors of a dying world may enter into another heritage in the world without end.

It is really secret bec ause it can be announced everywhere but can be understood and realised only in the hear ts of those who have entered into the experience within. In addition to such open memorials as are records o f saints and adepts in all churches and schools of Christendom, there is the Secret T ra dition of Christian Times enshrined in cryptic literatures, of which Alchemy on its spirit ual side offers a notable instance. The early history of the Rosy Cross is connected more e specially with this aspect of the great subject, though it has known many dedications and h as suffered many changes in its passage through the centuries and various countries of Europe. It reaches here and now its final evolution in the Sacred Rites of our Fellowsh ip. Antiquity, my Brother, is not regarded among us as essentially a test of value, a nd we confess that we have separated ourselves from much that was of false-seeming and d isordered enthusiasm while continuing therefore to preserve the holy. It was a pilgrimage of the soul in GOD. a return journey toward the centre. He tarried at other houses of as sembly, where it might be said that he came unto his own and that his own received him. As he had been taught according to the letter within the convent gate, so did he learn oth erwhere according to the grace of the inward meaning.

But it was to be despised and r ejected of men, more especially by the wise in their wisdom. It was only in his own cloister that he found a few of the elect, with whom he abode in a House of the Holy Spirit. Such was the b eginning of our Fraternity of the Rosy Cross, incorporating at first four persons only, be ing the number of our natural humanity, but afterwards increased to eight, the number of th e Christhood. It was agreed that the Brotherhood as such should remain secret one hundre d and twenty years, or for that symbolical period which answers to the earthly age of the Postulant - when he stands on the threshold of T IPHERET H, awaiting the Second Birth, the new age and the life of regeneration therein. Subsequently some of the Bret hren were scattered through various countries on works of ministry. They appointed succ essors in accordance with the Laws of the Order, and there arose in this manner that Seco nd Circle of Initiates which is mentioned in the original memorials. The years had elapsed, and the Loving Frater C R C had passed from the House of the Holy Spirit in T IPHERET H to the Se cret Church in DAAT H. T he Members of the First Circle had been dissolved also in their day. T hose who came after them knew little of the sodality in its beginning, and -as it is hinted in the records - had not been admitted to all things.

The natural man is complete in his own degree, but abov e this there is the manhood of the Sacred Temple. From the life of man in Nature, from the death which ensues thereon and opens the further prospects, we who have been calle d of the spirit have sought a path of elevation toward a more perfect mode. It is in losi ng that which the natural man holds most desirable that the spiritual man, after six days, s hall find himself. We have looked for life in GOD and have been crucified in Him to all which her e below interposes between Life Divine and the free way of the Quest. We have stripped off the old vestures, praying to be clothed in GOD. We have found that the quest is love and that is also the end. In paths of contemplation, and these are paths of love; in the rule of sacrifi ce, which is love rnade holy; we have found that life is love. Opened to Divine Love on the thr eshold of the life of T IPHERET H, we have been born by love into true life forever. We h ave laid bare our whole being to the sacred influx of love, and this is the life of the Cross. We have become the Mystic Rose in the centre of the Holy Cross.

I certify that Frater Non Nobis, Domine, and those who were with him, heard in the House of the Spirit and its Holy Sanctuary the Voic e of the Master, testifying concerning Divine Darkness and union with the Divine therein. It is an opening of the inward world and plenary realisation of the Presence in the cons cious soul, though it is told after another manner in the records which remain among us. T here it is firstly that they discovered the body of the Founder, who bore the book of the Myste ries on his breast, a treasure to be hidden from the world. But it is said also that thi s book contained by way of colophon the inscription: EX DEONASCIMUR, INJ ESU MORIMUR, PER SP IRIT UM SANCT UM REVIVISCIMUS. And this is a summary in brief of the Rosy Cross in all its Grades of evolution. Take it into your heart, my Brother, hav ing prepared the heart as earth of the mystical kingdom. Let it dwell as a seed therein; t he letter of the words shall die; the flower of the inward sense shall spring therefrom. The cou nsel is always to lose the symbols in their meaning. The material part should dissolve in the l ight of its spiritual significance, and this is what is meant among us by getting behind the sym bol.

The seven walls are also the SEPHIROTH from YESOD to DA ATH inclusive, it being understood that the last lies within the mystical decade but is not computed therewith in our Secret Tradition. It is the Threshold of the Supernals. In the middle place on the summit of each wall is the White Wheel or Sign of the Christ-Spirit, referring to the Divine Imman ence which is present in all creation and operates in all the states of grace and attainment experienced by the soul of man. The Sign of the Planet itself occupies the centre of the wall, enclosed within th e circle of the SEPHI RA to which it belongs, while about it are the Divine Names and Sephirotic titles referred to each numeration. The ground of each wall is on the rainbow or spectrum colour ascr ibed to the particular planet, while its spiritual counterpart is that of the Sacred SEP H I RA.

The Vestibule which is without the Portal has in its centre the Mystic Alt ar of the Rite, in the form of a perfect cube vested in white. At the western angles thereof two great candlesticks or Pillars are placed on the floor; of these the one in the South bears a lighte d candl- and that in the north a skull. The lighted candle should, if possible, be the only illuminatio n in the Temple, but shaded or otherwise subdued lamps may be placed, if necessary, at points which are of no symbolical importance. The Tarot Keys of Lamed and Mem are arranged side by side on the Altar. The Paths corresponding thereto are not otherwise indicated than by the two Pillars which symbolise the Path of Lamed, and by the Tomb itself which signifies that of Mem. Two se ats facing the Tomb are provided for the Celebrants, the place of the Chief Adept being at t he south side, close to the Altar, and that of the Second Adept in similar contiguity on the north side. Both officers appear in the robes allotted to the corresponding Celebrants of the 5-6 Grade, a nd are saluted by the same titles, the Merciful Exempt Adept holding in actuality or imputation the august Degree of 7-4. Strictly speaking the Celebrant in Chief is therefore in the same positio n as the Praemonstrator of an Outer Temple, that is, a ruler empowered from beyond. The Usher of the Rite has his proper place at the Door of Entrance, and the goings and comings of the Candida te are more especially under his charge. He has the title of Frater Parepidemos Vallis. It should be observed that the First Point of the C eremony corresponds to the Portal of the 5-6 Grade, and that the Portal attributed to Me m is the Door of the Tomb itself. The passage from Sephira to Sephira is in both cases, by the di rect lineal way, and not by the circuitous Path of the Serpent, as in the Grades of the Outer Order . The Merciful Exempt Adept opens the Rite with a sin gle knock and proceeds as follows: Chief. Fratres and Sorores Adepti Majores, I invite you to join your intention with mine in the great act of Opening the Shrine of the West. (All rise.) Chief.

Associate Adeptus Minor, you have already traversed unto our auspices many paths of experience and have been advanced in many Grades of our Mystery. In each of these the Candidate by a voluntary act gives himself to the Order, in r eturn for the measure of illumination which it then confers upon him. You have crossed long ago the thr eshold of spiritual knowledge, but, having been still far from the goal, you have, at least in a ce rtain sense, known periods of drought and dryness; yet you have ever looked for those better things which come in the land of the Living. All Degrees, however, end in expectation; all foreshadow somethi ng greater than themselves, from which the Candidate should arise to an experience in the real Order. But it is still communicated only in symbol s, and during the period of our earthly exile the Word of Life is never spoken with the lips. This notwithstanding, the initiations of the Mysteries a re true and efficacious, because they convey in circumstantial signs and tokens the living end of A deptship. They shadow forth the secret doctrine of the union; and, seeing that outside time, we have c ome forth from God Who is our end; seeing that again outside time, we aspire to return, the pledge s of our reception exact a great reticence, not onl y in respect of the accidentals but of the Essentials"},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"VOLUME SEVEN 135 signified by our progress apart from those things w hich here exceed expression. It is for this reason that when the Initiate goes out int o the world he takes with him the letters only of the sacred books. The Spirit communicated in the Temple is reserved to the Temple. The letter alone can be used outside the Sanctuary. It is night always outside the Lodge of the Adepts. The letter also is used within the Sanctuar y, but there is the sense of many meanings behind it, even as by the arrangement of our Lodges something is assumed that has preceded, while our f un da me nta l d oc trin es ar e s et for th , f or th ose wh o ca n gra sp t he m, t hat t her e i s something also which comes after. Beloved brother, we are not now, at least substantially, with the Centre. We have, in a sense, come forth th erefrom, and in the end we shall return thereto. We came forth naked into our exile, we go forth naked at our call. We must also again issue naked on our second birth, having put a way the things which were before. We enter into a new state of consciousness, and have t o be clothed upon.

Remember als o, that no initiation or advancement can confer the Light auto matically, but they do co nfer it symbolically, which is their law and their order. It is in this sense only that the Sanc tuaries of the Mysteries signify those places in which there is a dispensation of the Light to ev ery man who has come into this world. It is in this sense that these places are worlds of trans cension, the Penetralia in which Plotinus found the identity of subject and object, the Templ e of the Ideal Reality which is concealed b eh in d a pp ear an ces .

T hat Wo rd of th e M yst er y o f Illumination, designed ultimately to disperse th e Mystery of Darkness is the message to an unborn soul, and thereto the influx of Light mak es known that in order to attain perfection the soul must assume flesh.

In the Grade of Theoricus we are reminded of the Hermetic philosophy which was accustomed to ins truct its disciples that it was useless to go in search of the practice till they had worked o ut a clear theory. T he soul, after a ma nner, is formulating the theory of the work outsi de the prime condition conceived in the Second Degree. It has so far worked well that the q uest is ended; it has found its parents and the process of generation is inaugurated. By an act of its own will the soul has consented to immersion in the material, and has passed into the deep sleep of gestation. In the Grade of Practicus there is presented symbolically that unse en process by which the physical body is designed and the building of the house b e gi ns . The next Grade refers to the building of the house in beauty to become the Temple of the Living Soul. Though it is termed and that fitly the Degree of Philosophus, its entire process is of an automatic kind, for the great expe riment is continued in virtue of those forces which ha ve b een pre viou sl y s et in moti on . The soul has renounced the remembrance of its forme r knowledge, nor has it gained the wisdom of the world, but that notwithstanding, it has deserved to be classed as one who is friendly thereto, and has acted in consonance wi th its ends. We come now to that Grade which is without any number in our system. In its m ore remote interpretation it signifies the event of birth into natural life, for the attainmen t of which the soul has set aside all whatsoever that remained of its first prerogatives and has at the same time drunk of the chalice of forgetfulness. By his entrance therein, the newly-born man has ceased to remember the past, and before him spreads the unkno wn future, even as those who in the Order of the Golden Dawn enter at a given season wi thin the experience of the Portal as recipients who at least by the hypothesis, are unaw are whether there is anything beyond it, while a certain imputed forgetfulness, or setting a side, is symbolically assured by the change in the name of the Member who has passed wit hin the First Circle of the Fraternity by the ostensible renunciation of his earthly title s.

The time may be long or short, but it comes about in due season that they who have entered by the doo r, or those at least who have not at this stage suffered the calamity of abortment, are recei ved into the 5-6 Grade, in which the powers of life are manifested, and for a period whi ch is for symbolic reasons fixed at six years, they pass through the varied experiences whi ch symbolise material existence. Herein they are after the manner of men whose eyes have be en opened recently; they behold many things in a distorted light and some others are inv erted. T hey are to a certain extent in the wonder-state of childhood.

It is a period for the exercise of di vination, for the telling of fortunes, the study of Astrology, the placing of fantastic constr uctions on Grades and Liturgies; and they believe that they are in possession of great and se cret knowledge if in some strange and r e ve rse d irec tio n t he y re vo l ve t he whe el of fo rt un e .

It will be understood that the conscious realization of this symbolism at the stag e in question is not expressly supposed, and, as said previously, the quality of direction v aries; but, in any case, the time arrives when every guided member of the 5-6 Grade begins to realise that the sequence of Rites in the Order, apart from the Sephirotic scheme, suppos es that beyond the Adeptus Minor there is and must be some higher stage of knowledge, even as in material life, for all thinking men a mo ment also comes, when they realise, however dimly , that the things of earth are not the grand totality. It is the symbolical experience of this other side of the existence"},{"pageNumber":742,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 138 which the 6-5 Grade offers to the prepared Postulan t. It is this which is now offered to you; but before we proceed further, it is necessary that I s hould ask you formally whether you are still prepar ed to continue the Rite of your advancement, and to un dergo the severe test of your perseverance and fortitude, which is of necessity involved therein. If so, you will arise and signify your assent by th e communication of the LVX signs peculiar to the 5-6 Grade. (The Postulant who intends to go forward, gives the signs as required, rising from h is seat for the purpose and then again resuming it. ) Chief. Beloved brother, the Order applauds your fortitude. It is written that the last shall be first, and the Associate Adeptus Minor does not differ gen erically from the Exempt Adept. Your knowledge of the hierarchic symbolism which characterises the Mysteries will have shown you that the Celebrants of every Rite are either one or three. W e are therefore united as it were, in a common act, which depends in part on us and in part on you. It is for this reason that you have been addressed in the present Ceremony by the title of the Third Adep t in the procedure of the 5-6 Grade. As such, I again commit you, for the time being into the hands of the Second Celebrant. (The Chief Adept resumes his seat.) Second. Associate Adeptus Minor, I will ask you to approach the eastern side of the Altar. (This is done accordingly, and the Second Adept rises, so th at he can see the diagrams on the Altar, when he explains the Path of Lamed.) Second. The Portal of the 6-5 Grade is reached as in previo us cases by symbolically traversing certain Paths which are the channels of communicati on from Sephira to Sephira in the scheme of the Tree of Life. Those which are now open before you a re the Paths of Lamed and Mem by which Geburah is attained in the ascent respectively from the Grade of Adeptus Minor and from the grade of Practicus in the Order of the Golden Dawn. All t rue Paths are however the Paths of the Unity, and those who have been received into the Mysteries kno w that man returns by many ways whence he came. I will ask you to observe here that as in the First Order the Candidate has followed the Paths according to the scheme of their correspondence wit h the body of the Serpent on the Tree of Life, so in the Second Order, and in the Grades of the Porta l thereof, he follows them in a direct ascent. The explanation is that previously to birth, the Paths of Nature in growth and evolution were the course of man's progress, but in the Degrees after birth h is own will must be his aid. The letters Lamed and Mem are both of importance in Qabalism, and they correspond, as you already know, in another order of symbolism to the 1 lth and 12th Keys of the Tarot which are depicted in these diagrams on the Altar."},{"pageNumber":743,"pageContent":"VOLUME SEVEN 139 T hat to which your attention is especially drawn is the Key of Justice, referable to the letter Lamed, whereto many attributions are giv en. T he writers of the Zohar and the old scholiasts thereon dwell upon the form of Lamed, wh ich is the highest of all the letters; they say also that it is composite, being formulated of Vau and Kaph. These are the accidents of their subtlety; but you should know that its domini on is in the hour of the planet Shabbathai or Saturn, because from Binah, which is the great S abbath, the rest whereof we desire, there is an influx to the Path of Lamed, through the Path of Geburah, from the Sephira Binah. It further denotes the Mystery of Equilibrium. Now, th e place of Geburah can be withstood only by those who restrain their concupiscence, bec ause it is the Supernal Tribunal, and Geburah, in this sense, signifies the force of will , as Lamed is the condition of equilibrium, which represents the Portal of the Mysteries. The i deas which have been thus expressed are found differently exhibited by another order of sym bolism in the two Pillars which stand at the western angles of the Altar, bearing respective ly a lighted candle and a human skull. With the conventional attributions of light in the mystical order and the obvious lessons to be derived from the disjecta membra of humanity, we have no concern here. They speak too fully for themselves. Of that death which encompass es us in the midst of ordinary life there is however little realisation. All that falls short of the mystic end falls short of the life of life, outside of which we are still in the sphere of simu lacra. You have heard, 0 brother, how often, of a Light which shineth in the Darkness, an d that the Darkness comprehendeth it not. T he Light thus referred to is at once the myst ic end and the Life of Life. It is that without which the natural man is, according to the Qabalah, complete after his own manner, possessing by the communication of nature an unders tanding qualified to protect him and minister to his daily wants. But as such, he is, to all intents and purposes, without any part in Eternity, and he reigns simply as a leader of th e animal world. It is possible, however, that another light may be added to his natural cond ition, by the desire of the true end which is set before all beings, and of the life which is beyon d all life of the apparent order. It is then that he is made ready to set out on the great search, when the higher light which has now entered within him goes also before him, and th e desire of the Holy House is enkindled in his heart. In this manner he passes under the ju dgments and severities of his election, behind which is the concealed love that shall take him to his term. For as the natural man is impelled by a certain elementary justice suited to his condition, so there is a justice which is above, working in the souls of the chosen ones, so that once indeed, they shall taste death, that they may pass into life for ever, under the au spices of the Faithful Intelligence. It is not, however, through the Portal of Lamed that you can enter into the Mysteries which are beyond the Grade symb olizing material life. The con templation therein and the Path thereto belonging is a middle state between life and death, and its result is the attainment of that which we term symbolically the Path of Mem. As a re membrance of this meditation and of the place which it occupies, I now set you between the two Pillars, bearing respectively the lighted candle as a token of life, and the skull as the witness of mortality; and I bid you remember the dispassionate equilibrium which is poi sed between life and death, and I bid you also observe that the Altar in this Grade is cubica l and"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 140 white, to show that before you can discover the man ifestation in concealment of the Rose, the Cross of the manifestation of life in Tip hareth must reclose its arms in a state of purity.

Associate Adeptus Minor, you will rememb er that the letter Mem occupies the middle position in the series of the Three Mothers. It is said in the school of the Zohar that its open operation is through the descent of its influe nce to the abyss, and thus it restrains the rising of those great waters by which the earth wou ld otherwise again be inundated. In its closed operation it restricts the power of judgment from the downward course thereof.

The Divine, in a word, is drowned in the waters of natu ral life; and that which in this respect obtains in the external world, obtains also for hum anity, wherein the Divine Spark, beyond all plummets of the sense, all reach of the logical understanding, is immersed in the waters of the material existence. In both cases, the symbol w ith which we are dealing corresponds to the legend of our Founder, sleeping in the centre of th e Tomb, which is encircled by the Rainbow, as in the Sanctuary of Israel there was th e abiding Presence of the Shekinah. We must remember, moreover, that the ocean of phenomen al life supports on its surface the mystical Ark of Noah, which, in one of its aspects, is the Vessel of Correspondences, wherein the types of all things were collected from the wre ckage of the old initiations for transmission through a new era. In another sense, which is intim ately connected with the first, the Ark is the body of man, the ship of humanity, poised on th e waters of the world which conceal the divine within them. It is man, collective and indiv idual, man in possession of his senses and also enclosed by his senses. There is that within h im which, during this his time of probation is put to sleep as deeply as the symbolical Giant. His originally great nature is restricted in the body after the manner of God in creation. There is yet another aspect in which we may regard the Ark, for by many issues the great symbols open upon the Infinite which they show forth, though it is after the manner of a reversed glass m inutely. It is that namely, which for a time suspends the soul's communication with the external that she may receive the influx of the Divine. It is the house of deep contemplation, of f ixed, well-directed thought, by which our exit is found fora time, even from thought itself, to the world of true experience. The ceremony of the 6-5 Grade symbolises this indrawn state, in which connection I would ask you to remember that in the roof of the Ark of old there w as a window through which the Dove passed and repassed, now in frustrated flight, beca use many wings are beaters at the Golden Gates; now bearing the olive-branch of peace which for us signifies the suspension of the life of the senses. But, in fine, there came an hour whe n the dove returned no more, because the aspiration and outreaching of the soul at length at tains its term. Beloved brother, we have dwelt at great length upon the import of certain sy mbols, for albeit the work of detachment may operate scarcely less in suspension from the wo rld, yet it is through many types that we pass ultimately behind the veils. I have therefore something to say to you of Mercury , which the Alchemists in their secret language, tell us is coagulated by its inter ior sulphur, this operation being the conjunction of their Sun and Moon, or the marriage of Adam and Eve. Now, this can be understood mystically, because they say also that h erein is the union of Heaven and Earth, by which you will see that all systems of symbolism, h owever apparently divergent, meet in the ultimate identity of their one object. It is affirm ed further that we now behold Mercury as it"},{"pageNumber":746,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 142 exists imprisoned in a body, but there will come a day when we shall see it set free from its present limitations and manifested as a pu re, fixed, intelligible, constant fire.

You know further that ordinary thoug ht is wandering and volatile, and this is the Mercury which the Adept is called upon to fix. I have spoken on the Authority of the Alchemists concerning our imprisoned and liberated Mercury; which are also the forms of thought, one of them errant in the Material and con fined therein, the other emancipated; the one volatile, the other fixed by wisdom. Their corr espondences in Egyptian symbolism are AN U BIS, the Guardian of the Egyptian Tomb and pre venting entrance therein, the Mystic T omb being the Gate of Life; and T HOT H, who enables man finally to penetrate t her ein . T hi s i s t he W ord whi ch is s ou ght in al l i niti atio ns , whic h is re ver sed a nd transliterated, is substituted after all manners, to be recovered fina lly in the vestures of another sense, as it is said by St. Paul: We shall not all die, but we s hall be changed, in a mo ment, in the twinkling of an eye.

Associate Adeptus Minor, I now ask you to remember that the dead Gods are useless, whether Christ or Osiris. If the Titan imm ersed beneath the great waters can never more waken, there is no need that we should have pa rt in Him, for we are seeking the fuller life, that truth and beauty which are ever ancient yet ever new. But even as in the old legend the c o mmu n ica tio n o f a Gr an d Hail in g Si gn a wa ke ne d t he Prin ces s fr o m a sle ep of o ne hundred years, so is the slumber of the gods precio us to the soul of the Postulant at the Gate of the Holy of Holies, because of that Centre wherein is the utter stillness of a great activity. They are not dead but sleeping; it is for us to man ifest them without by the penetration of the Centre, and it is in this way that the Divine w ill awaken within us. It is for this reason that the limbs of the Titan correspond in their pos ture to a form of the Fylfot Cross, for though he appears to be dead and has suffered a rea l death, he is yet the source of life and activity in the universe; for this reason also the direction of the face of the Titan symbolises the appeal of God to man.

Both hands are therefore placed in front of the eyes, with the palms outwards, the arms stretched forward, and the face turned right or left. The lat ter signifies the putting away of the lower desires, and it corresponds to Nephthys kneeling at the foot of the bier. The former Sign signifies the setting aside of the manifested symbo ls of mind, together with mortal desires; it corresponds to Isis at the head of the bier. The averting of the face to the left is the first part of the two-fold Sign, and to the right is the secon d part. The Grip or Token is symbolical of the union of opposites and the form of the Pentagra m. It is given by the left hand clasping the right. It ma y also b e gi ven thus with both hand s. It for ms the Ke y to the Greater and Lesser Rituals of the Pentagram. The Active Element s belong to the right, and the Passive Elements to the left hand, while the Spirit is refe rable to both. It will also be noticed that the lines of evocation of air and water are arranged to draw the force out of the hands, and of earth and fire to draw the force of those Elements out of the body. The Equilibriating Pentagrams, which are those of the Spirit, are comm enced along the lines of the thumbs. The Symbol is Pison, the first river of Eden, which flows into the land where there is gold. T he Mystic Number is 15, whence is formed the Passw ord YOD HE, the constructive form of the Tetragrammaton, derived fr om signifying to exist or to be.

FRATER FINEM RESPICE The Vault of the Adepti may be said to represent or symbolise various things. First, of course, it is the symbolic burying place of our founder C.R.C. It is also the mystic Cavern in the Sacred Mountain of Initiation - Abiegnus. Therefore it is the Chamber of Initiation wherein, after passing throug h the preliminary training of the Outer, we are received into the Portal of the Rose of Rubv and the Cross of Gold. All who are eligible should use the Vault when it i s in its place. When working it is well to be clothed in the white robe and yellow sash, yellow slippers and yellow and white nemyss on your head. The Rose Cross Lamen sho uld be upon the breast. Remember that within the Vault you never use a banishing ritual. The chamber is highly charged by the Ceremonies which have been he ld there, and the atmosphere thus created should not be disturbed. At first, I do not recommend you to fast as a preli minary. Though later on, when you set yourselves to attain some definite poi nt, this may be necessary. Being then clothed, and at peace, you enter the Vault, li ght the candle, and kindle either a pantile in the small censer or, if you prefer it, s ome incense in the larger one. Place a chair as near East as you can, and having s hut the door stand in the East facing West, the door by which you entered, the wal l bearing the symbol of Venus. Now cross your hands upon your breast in the Sign o f Osiris Arisen, breathe in a fourfold rhythm regularly, and compose your mind. Then, being calm and collected, make the full LVX S igns, and endeavour to bring down the Divine White Brilliance. Having done this, seat yourself, and give yourself up to meditation, tranquil and without fea r. At first try to feel, it may be, or to see the play of the colours as they pass and repass from side to side and from square to square. Then await with serene expectation what message may be vouchsafed you. When you are used to the vault it is well to exting uish the light, for the darker the material atmosphere the better it is. Before leavin g the Vault make the LVX Signs, and quit it with arms crossed upon the breast in the Si gn of Osiris Arisen."},{"pageNumber":792,"pageContent":"VOLUME EIGHT 29 If you have elected to work in a group of two or th ree, proceed in the same manner, but take care to place yourselves in balanced dispositi on. Let me warn you never to argue, even in a friendly manner while in the Vault. It may often happen that one of you sees more or less differently from the others. In this case make an a udible note of the differences but do not go on to discuss it till you have ended the sitting, a s any discussion is apt to disturb the delicate currents and so break the thread of your vision. It is permissible to take notes in writing during the sitting, but on the whole it is perhaps more sa tisfactory to impress everything clearly on your mind, and write it down immediately afterward. The next seven visits should be devoted to a carefu l study of each side of the vault in turn, recalling all you know about each before you begin, and having your queries defined before you expect replies. Another time, contemplate the roof, and if you feel strong enough, the floor. But it is best for you to have an advanced Adept with you for the latter. Again, you may wish to draw aside the Altar, lift the lid of the Pastos and con template the figure you may perceive lying within it. For this you should have a small candle lit on the Altar. Or you may lie down in the Pastos yourself and meditate there. Sometimes you m ay see the simulacrum of C.R.C. in the Pastos, or it may be your own Higher Self. In every case you should gain knowledge, power and satisfaction. If you do not, you may be sure yo u are either acting from a wrong motive, or you are not physically strong enough, or your metho ds are at fault. No normal person in a good state of mind can possibly spend half an hour in th is way without feeling better for it. But if you should happen to be out of harmony with your su rroundings or at variance with your neighbours, leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled. When more than one person enters the Vault, they mu st all make the LVX Signs together. MORE ABOUT THE VAULT By G.H. FRATER SAPERE AUDE The Tomb or Vault is a small seven sided chamber wi th a black floor, a white ceiling. The Pastos lies with its head to the East; over it is the Circular Altar. The accompanying plan (See Adeptus Minor Ritual) sh ows this position. The Altar bears the symbols of the four Elements -- a red, a yellow, a blue, and a black disc surrounded by a white Circle. In the red Disc is a green Lion. In the yellow Disc is a purple Kerub of a man's I-lead. In the blue Disc is an orange Eagle. In the Black D isc is a white Ox. These four discs surround the letter Shin which is painted in white in the centre, exactly under the White Rose in the middle of the ceiling."},{"pageNumber":793,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 30 Near this Shin stands a small crucifix. The carved ivory figure and the antique Florentine workmanship and the carved rose of 25 pe tals, behind the head, was made for this purpose in Venice. The colours represent the interchanging energies of the S pirit and the Elements. This figure of Christ surmounted by the f our Elements symbolises the perfected Adept who has so balanced his elemental n ature that the Divine Spirit can manifest in him. (This is not a constant element in the symbolism of the vault. I.R.) The Cup, Dagger, Chain and Burning Lam p, each stati oned in its own Element, simply repeat the same s ymbolism. It should be observed that the Four elements are pl aced according to the Zodiac. That is to say, that Fire, Lion Kerub and A ries are to the East. Air, Man Kerub and Libra to the West. Water, Eagle Kerub and Cancer to the North. Earth, Bull Kerub, and Capricorn to the S outh. This is the direction of the Enochian Tablets of th e Elements and points to that to which the Adept should look when he wishes to vi sit Elemental or Astral regions. For a planet, it is better to find the actual position from an ephemeris in usual work. Sitting in the Tomb, it is sufficient to astrally rise thro ugh the white ceiling with the correct names and symbols and vibrating the former whilst d oing so. The cubical Altar is an outer Temple and one arranged by an Adept, bearing the four implements and the four elements in a different order. This is accordi ng to the Winds. Incense (or Rose) and Dagger, Air to the East. Wate r in Cup, Water to the West. Salt and P entacle to the North. Lamp and Fire W and to the S outh. The Red Cross and W hite Triangle in the middle is t he place of the letter S hin. In the lesser Ritual of the Pentagram, the Archange ls are arranged in the position of the elements in the Cubical Altar. \"Before me Raphael\" is said facing East; he is the Archangel of Air. \"Behind me Gabriel\" is said facing West; he is the Archangel o f Water. This arrangement is used in the invocation of any force in a Temple, or ordinar y room. The Hierophant follows this rule in his invocation of the Elemental S pirit s in the Outer Ceremonies. For the Consecration of a Talisman, the Adept must look towards the East if he wishes to invoke the Powers of the Air. Though if h e intends to visit those regions symbolised by the Vayu Tattwa or the Air Tablet, he must astrally fly westwards. This information is given in the Lesser Ritual of the P e ntagram but in so complex a form that it is difficult to comprehend it clearl y. The separate clairvoyant stud y of these four circle s on the Altar over the Tomb is extremely interesting. By it, the forces of the Elements on the active side can be observed s ymbolicall y and contrasted with the sa me on the passive side, as seen in the simple Tattwas. Instead of holding a paper s ymbol, the Adept can sit in the Tomb and feel himself pass through the selected dis c having first invoked the Divine Names and used the suitable Pentagrams. By simply u sing the Pentagrams and vibrating the Deity Names allotted to it, the Black ness of the atmosphere of the Tomb can be so charged with the astral colours of the el ement, that it seems visible to the material eyesight."},{"pageNumber":794,"pageContent":"VOLUME EIGHT 31 It is necessary to balance the people sitting in th e Tomb. The most practised should take the place at the head of the Pastos, wi th the beginner on either side. But where only two are working together, they should si t opposite each other at the sides or at the head and foot of the P astos. The Lotus Wand should be held by the white portion when Spirit is being invoked. When an Element is chosen, a suitable colo ured band should be selected. After some practice, it is not difficult to find th e correct band in the dark. At first it is better to hold it before ex tinguishing the light . Even when first sitting in the Tomb, strange bluish balls of floating light, like phosphorus, will be seen b y natural clairvoyan ts. These are not to be confused with the ordinary da ylight remaining in the e yes wh en we go into a dark room. CONCERNING THE CROOK AND THE S COURGE The Crook therefore is divided into the colours sym bolic of Kether, Air, Chokmah, Taurus, Chesed, Leo, Tiphareth, Aries, Hod , Capricorn. The Scourge is divided into the colours symbolising Netzach, Tipha reth, Gemini, Binah, Cancer, Geburah and W ater. CONCERNING THE W ALLS Each Wall of the Tomb is said mysticall y to be 5 fe et in breadth, 8 feet in height, thus yielding 40 squares, of which 10 are m arked and salient representing the Ten Sephiroth in the form of the Tree of Life, acti ng through the planets. (Note: There are various methods of colouring the s ides. That here described is considered the best and most effective. But it r equires perfect pigments and ver y great artistic skill in blending them. If not perfe ctly done, the result is dull and unluminous. And even pigments originall y perfect, c hange with time. N.O.M.) Another method and that used in the Amen-Ka Vault ( in Edinburgh) is to form the symbol in its own colours placed on the sq uare of its own color -- the planet on its own side being expressed in its complimentar y colour. Thus the Venus symbol on the door side is red on a green ground. These colou rs cut from coloured paper, if accurate, are more brilliant than pigments. Note that in all the central upper squares above re main white and unchangeable, representing the changelessness of th e Divine S pirit, thus developing all from the One through the man y under the government of the One. The colour of the varying squares may either be rep resented by the colour of the Planet and the colour of the force therein bein g mixed together, or by these colours being placed in juxtaposition or in any other conve nient manner, but the foundation of them all is under the Minutum Mundum Diagram. The S pirit square on each side has the same outward appearance, but when studied clairvoyantly each will be found to have ch aracteristics in harmony with the Planet. (that is, of the particular side.)"},{"pageNumber":795,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 32 The Zodiacal squares are much better explained when the actual planet of that particular side is in the sign. Such as, during the month of A ugust, Sol is in the sign of Leo. Then choose the Leo Zodiacal square on the Solar side, o r any other planet in the same manner. Those who are not familiar with pigments should be careful to examine the colour of the square that they are about to study and also the co ntrasting colour of the symbol therein. It is important that it should be clearly impressed on the mind before the Tomb is darkened. (N. B. A great deal of the foregoing is unnecessari ly complicated. The most practical plan is to have the walls of the Vault co loured as in the Adeptus Minor Ritual. Then the way to differentiate between the various p lanetary sides of the Vault is simply to cover any particular side with a large sh eet of strong cellophane or other plastic. So, for the Venus side, the painted wall c ould be covered with a Green sheet of plastic. for the Jupiter side with a blue sheet of plastic. For the Mars side with dark red. For the Saturn side with ver y dark b lue or ind igo. For the S olar side, use yellow or gold plastic. For Mercury, a yellow orang e plastic. and for Luna, a lavender or light violet plastic. In the 1890's there was no technology whereby this could be done. There is to- day. And this eliminates the fine shading of colour with delicate hues which requires a competent artist to depict. To-day, plastic sheet s can be obtained in almost any color. This eliminates all the artistic difficultie s involved, and simplifies the task b y having all seven walls coloured in exactly the s ame manner. The different covering plastic sheets will demonstrate what planetary side of the Vault is involved. 1.R.) THE PASTOS The Pastos which stands under the Circular Altar ha s no bottom but a hinged lid which can be turned hack during the S econd P oin t of the 5-6 Ceremon y. The inner surface bears the Colours of the Forces. Both the inner and the outer of the right side are in the positive Scale o f Colours. To the left, they are in the negative Scale of Colours. The head is white inside and out. Outside it bears the Red Rose of 49 petals on a Golden Greek Cross. Inside the 10 Colours of the Masculine Scale on the Sephiroth in the Tree of life. The foot is black inside and o ut. Outside there is a calvary Cross on three steps with a circle. Inside, the 10 childr en Colours in the S ephiroth on the Tree. (N.B. Outside, Red Rose on golden cross, gold centr e with green leaves. Foot: outside, white cross on a black ground. The c oloured diagram of the Minutum Mundum is given in t he section of coloured plates i n this book. An understanding of Hodos Chamelionis is absolutely indispensable wh en considering the colouring of the Vault. I.R.) THE S EVEN S IDES The mere arrangement of the symbols of each side of the Tomb is at first sight difficult to comprehend and remember."},{"pageNumber":796,"pageContent":"VOLUME EIGHT 33 The first diagram given in the 5-6 ritual shows the Sephiroth alone, so as clearly to get the root of the matter into the memory. The second is a diagram with only the Kerubic rank, the Zodiac and the Planets. The third shows all the symbols. The coloured diagram (from Hodos Chamelionis) is th e key to every side, though it is not like any of them since the colour of the Planetary attribution of any one side modifies the basic pattern. Compared with the third diagram it will show the natural ground colour of every square. On the sides of the Tomb these colours are each mix ed with that of the Planet of that particular side. Every symbol is formed of the complementary colour of the square mixed with the complementary colour of the P lanet of the side. A careful study of the diagrams will show the result of these mixtu res. These is some difficulty for those who are not used to pigments in comprehending the reason for the particular colours used on the sides of the Tomb. To make this clear, the seven solar squares have be en selected as examples. In addition to this, there are added the two squares f rom the Venus side bearing the symbol Aquarius. The first is that in the Kerubic r ank Air, Vau is yellow; the second is that below it, the fifth from the top, where it is the purple Aquarius of the Zodiac. Following is the complete side of Luna. The three A lchemical Principles are coloured thus: Sulphur is Pink; Salt is Pale Blue; Mercury i s Pale Yellow. These are blended on the sides of the Tomb in the s ame manner as the other squares. The complemantary colours of the Planets Mars, Sun, Venus and Moon are easily understood. Mars red is the complement of Ve nus green. Sun orange is the complementary colour of Moon blue. But as there are 7 Planets, the exact complementary colour of each one cannot be always c learl y expressed by that of another planet. Hence Saturn and Jupiter, indigo an d purple, both have yellow for a complementary colour. Yet yellow. Mercury, is not e xactly that of either of them. A careful study of the Zodiacal colours settles the q uestion. Capricorn indigo is that of Saturn. Capricorn is opposite of Cancer, so that am ber of Cancer is the complementary of indigo. Aquarius purple is the Jup iterian colour, Leo is opposite to Aquarius so that the complement of purple is greeni sh yellow. The Mercury yellow is not found in the Zodiac. This colour is the complem entary of a very clear purple amethyst, neither bluish nor reddish. The `flash' of light from carefully balanced comple mentary colours is a matter of common optics. It is the shining from the blende d rays, making a whiteness which in pigments would be blackness. It is a sign that t he Talisman bears the correct colours. There is nothing occult about such a `flas h.' It is often seen on vulgarly effective advertisements, and is quite different fr om the Astral flash of brilliancy which shows when a Talisman is properly charged wit h the desired Force.

Among those characteristics which are truly necessa ry in the pursuit of magical knowledge and power, there is hardly any one more essential t han thoroughness. And there is no failing more common in modern life than superficiality. There are many who, even in this grade which has be en gained by serious study, after being charmed and instructed by first view of the Vault o f Christian Rosencreutz, have made no attempt to study it as a new theme. There are many who have attended many ceremonial admissions and yet know nothing of the attribution of the seven sides, and nothing of the emblematic arrangement of the forty squares upon ea ch side. Some of you do not even know that Venus is in an as trological sense misplaced among the sides, and not two in five have been able to tell m e why this is so, or what is the basis of"},{"pageNumber":798,"pageContent":"VOLUME EIGHT 35 the arrangement of the seven colors and forces. Man y have told me which element out of the four is missing, and others have told me that the sign L eo occurs twice, but very few can tell me why the two forms of Leo are in different colours en ea ch case, and only a few can tell me without hesitation which Three Sephiroth have no planet att ached. And yet even in the 1°=10° grade you are told you m ust analyse and comprehend that light or Knowledge, and not only take it on personal authori ty. Let us then be Adepti in fact, and not only on the surface; let our investigations be more than skin deep. That only which you can demonstrate is really known to you, and that only w hich is comprehended can fructify and become spiritual progress as distinguished from int ellectual gain.

Hypocrisy does not become the laity; it is a fatal flaw in the character of the occultist. You know it is not only the teacher in t his Hall before whom you may be humiliated, but before your higher and divine Genius who can in no wise be deceived by outward seeming, but judgeth you by the heart, in that your spiritua l heart is but the reflection of his brightness and the image of his person, even as Malkuth is the mat erial image of Tiphareth, and Tiphareth the reflection of the crowned Wisdom of Kether, and the concealed One. There is but a couple of pages in the 5-6 Ritual wh ich refer to the symbolism of the seven sides of the Vault. Read them over carefully, and t hen let us study these things together. First, the seven sides as a group, and then the forty squares that are on each side. The seven sides are all alike in size and shape and subdivision, and the forty squares on each side bear the same symbols. But the colouring is va ried in the extreme, no two sides are alike in tint, and none of the squares are identical in colo ur excepting the single central upper square of each wall, that square bearing the Wheel of the Spi rit. The Seven walls are under the planetary presidency, one side to each planet. The subsidiary squares represent the colouring of the combined forces of the planet; the symbol of each s quare is represented by the ground colour, while the symbol is in the colour contrasted or com plementary to that of the ground. Now these planetary sides are found to be in a spec ial order, neither astronomical nor astrological. The common order of the succession of the planets is that defined by their relative distances from Earth, putting the Sun, however, in the Earth’s place in the series thus: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. Saturn is farthest from the Earth, and the Earth is between Mars and Venus. Beginning with Saturn in th e case of the Walls of the Vault, the order is Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Mercury, Venus, Moon . Here Mercury and Venus are transposed. But there is something more than this. For Saturn, the farthest off, is neither the door nor the East, nor anywhere else that is obviously intended. For it is the corner between the South and the South-West sides. Nor is Luna, at the other end of the scale, in any notable position on the old lines."},{"pageNumber":799,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 36 There is, then, a new key to their order to be foun d and used, and such as are very intuitive see it at a glance. The planets are in the order of the Rainbow colours, and in colours because this Adeptus Minor grade is the especial exponent of col ours. You Adepti are in the Path of the Chamelion—Hodos Chamelionis. If now you take the planetary colours and affix the planets and arrange them in the order of the solar spectrum and then bend up the series into a ring and make the chain into a Heptagram, and turn the whole about until you get the two ends of the series to meet at the Eastern point, you will have this mysterium: Violet—Jupiter Indigo—Saturn Blue—Moon Green—Venus Yellow—Mercury Orange—Sun Red—Mars Science teaches, and has rediscovered a great truth , that however valuable the seven colours of the prism may be, there are rays invisible and s o not demonstrated here by space. Beyond the red end of the spectrum begins the violet, and thes e have a great chemical or Yetsiratic force. These forces, ever present and unseen, are represen ted by the Chief Adept standing erect at the Eastern angle, the most powerful person in the grou p, and delegate of the Chiefs of the Second Order, and through them of the mystic Third Order. He it is who has, symbolically, at any rate, passed from death unto life, and holds the Keys of all the creeds. And he it is who may place in our hands the Keys of the locked Palace of the King if we are able to make our knocking heard. Representing the East, coming from the East, he fac es the Western world, bringing intuition with him; before him lies the symbolic body of our Maste r C.R.C., our grand exemplar and founder— or at other times, the empty pastos, from which he has arisen, the Chief Adept. He has Mars and Geburah at his right hand, and Jupi ter and Gedulah at his left hand. He faces Venus in the West, the Evening Star, which re presents the entry of the Candidate who has toiled all day until the evening. At even he enters the Western door of the planet Venus, that sole planet unto whose symbol alone all the Sephiroth ar e conformed. At “evening time there shall be light,” the light of the mixed colours. So the newl y admitted Adept comes in contact with a totality of the planetary forces for the first time . A great opportunity opens before him; let him see well that he use it worthily. He enters through the green side of the vault. Green is the colour of growth; let him see that he grows. Upon each side of the vault are forty squares, five vertical series and eight horizontal, the whole being symbolically 5’ x 8’. Now the published and printed Fama Fraternatitas says these forty feet were divided into ten squares. If you ar e mathematicians you would know that ten similar squares could not alone be placed in such a n area and yet fill it. Ten squares alone to fill a rectangle could only be placed in an area of the sh ape 5’ x 6’. Hence in the Fama, ten squares are marked and salient” — they are the Sephiroth."},{"pageNumber":800,"pageContent":"VOLUME EIGHT 37 Besides the Ten Sephiroth, there are the following: There are the Four Kerubim, Three Alchemical Principles, Three Elements, Seven Planet s, Twelve Zodiacal Signs, One Wheel of the Spirit—thus 40 in all. The Spirit Wheel is on e very side and always in the centre, and is always depicted unchanged in black upon white. Upon the side there are always the 4 Kerubic emblem s—zodiacal, yet different, for the Eagle replaces Scorpio. (Scorpio has three forms, the Sco rpion, the Eagle, and the Snake for the evil aspect.) These Kerubim represent the letters of the name YHV H, and note that they are always arranged in the Hebrew order of the letters. Yod fo r the Lion, Heh for the Eagle, Vau for the Man, Heh final for the Ox, the Tauric Earth. Note that these four Zodiacal signs are not in thei r own colours, but as symbols of the elements have elementary colours. As Zodiacal signs , then, they are found to be compounds of the zodiacal and planet colours; but they are here as Kerubic emblems compounded of the Elemental colour and the Planetary colour of the si de. The Three Principles are composed of the colour of the Principles, and the colour of the Planet of any particular wall. Mercury being fundam entally blue, Sulphur red, and Salt yellow. The Three Elements have fundamentally the usual thr ee colours, Fire red, Water blue, Air yellow. Note that Earth is missing. The Seven planets have their colours as are often s tated, and note that each of the seven is set beside its appropriate Sephirah, so that there are three Sephiroth which have no Planet: Kether, Chokmah, and Malkuth. The 12 Zodiacal Signs are the lower portion of the sides of the vertical column. The central one has none of the twelve; they are so allotted be tween the four remaining columns. Further note that they are only three ranks, the 5th, 7th, and 8th; none are in the 6th rank from above. This arrangement then shows: Four Triplicities and three Quaternaries. Observe well the arrangement; it is complex but not confused. 1. Kerubic Fixed Shining Rank 2. Cardinal Fiery Solar Rank 3. Common (mutable) Airy Subtle Rank From above down, or in columns these are: Earthy Si gns. Airy Signs. Watery Signs. Fiery Signs. Rank 5.

Here the earliest in the year is Gemini on the left of Mem, and passing left to Virgo, you then go round to extreme right to Sagittarius, pass centrewards to Pisces cl ose to Malkuth The colouring of each square is dual—a ground colou r, and the colour of the emblem. The ground colour is a compound of the colour of the Pl anet of the side tinting the colour of the Force to which the Square is allotted. Each side has the Square of its own planet in its o wn unmixed colour, and with this exception all the coloured grounds are compound. The emblem c olour is always complementary to the ground colour. The ritual of the Adeptus Minor gives the definite colours of each planet and sign which are to be used in this system. There are other allotmen ts of colour to each of these symbols and forces, but these are retained as mysteries yet to be evolved and revealed when you have become familiar with the present simple and elementary sys tem."},{"pageNumber":802,"pageContent":"VOLUME EIGHT 39 REQUIESCAT IN PACE By V.H.

If the Magician chooses to take the Tattwic tides i nto account, the Evocation should obviously coincide with the course of the Vayu Tatt wa. PREPARATION For a week prior to the Evocation, the Magician sho uld prepare himself in every way for the working. His meditations should every day i nclude the contemplation of Elemental Air. He should be keenly aware of those Corresponde nces of Air which he encounters in his daily life. Once during the week he should utilize the Spirit Vision to Skry or Travel in the sphere of Elemental Air. The Magician should prepare two Flashing Pantacles, a Lamen, and a Material Basis. The Pantacles should be identical in design, but di fferent in colour. Both should bear on the obverse side the Sigil from the Rose of the Angel C HASSAN enclosed in three concentric circles, between which are inscribed the hierarchic Names of Elemental Air, and on the reverse side a second symbol of the Angel CHASSAN d evised by the Magician. One of the Pantacles should be painted in the Yetziratic Colou r Scale of the Prince, and the other in the Assiatic Colour Scale of the Princess. The Lamen should bear on the obverse the design of the great Lamen of the Hierophant, and on the reverse the same design as on the obvers e of the Pantacles, though painted in the Briatic Colour Scale of the Queen. For the Material Basis, clay is excellent, both symbolically and practically. As a type of Earth, it is a symbol of the Assiatic manifestation to which the Magician calls the Spirit. It is also reminiscent o f the Adamic Clay into which the Elohim breathed Life, and of the Golem of the Ashkenazic Q abalists. From a practical perspective, the Clay (preferably `modeling clay' which doesn't hard en) is eminently adaptable, for its receptive nature allows it to contain many other materials. I t should have embedded in it the Elements of the Mystic Repast, or Magical Eucharist, which is p artaken of in the final moments of the Neophyte Grade. It should also contains as many mat erials sympathetic to the nature of the Spirit to be evoked as are available to the Magician; in t his case appropriate ingredients would include Galbanum, Peppermint, Aspen leaves, a small Topaz, a yellow feather and possibly a lodestone. For the Material Basis in the Evocation of an Air S pirit, the clay must be kept warm and moist. The Material Basis may be made in the colour of Air in the Assiatic Princess Scale by using an emerald green modeling clay sprinkled with gold `glitter.' If the Magician is preparing for a particularly difficult operation, or if he in tends for the Assiatic manifestation to continue for more than an hour, he may further charge the Ma terial Basis by adding to the Clay an appropriate Powder prepared in an Alchemical proces s according to the Z-3 formulae.

After consecration, the Pantacl es and Material Basis should be wrapped in a yellow silk cloth embroidered in purple Hebrew letters with the names SHADDAI EL CHAI and YHVH, along with the Kerubic symbol of AQU ARIUS in an encircled Pentagram (invoking Air and Spirit Active). The Lam en should be kept with the Hierophantic vestments. The Magic Circle and Triangle of Evocation should b e prepared in conformity with the diagram provided. The area between the inmost a nd the middle concentric circles should be white, and inscribed in black with the four Divi ne Names attributed to the Four Quarters separated by four TAU crosses. The area between the middle and the outermost circles should be yellow and inscribed in purple with four Hexagrams and Names of the powers of Air - SHADDAI EL CHAI, YHVH, RAPHAEL, ARIAL, CHASSA N, RUACH, MIZRACH, HIDDEKEL. In the middle of each Hexagram should sit a censer. The area between the outermost circle and the enclosing square should be yellow an d inscribed in purple with four Pentagrams. In the middle of each Pentagram should burn a yellow lamp. The area in the four circles located at the angles of the square ma y be either white or in the Queen Scale colours attributed to the Elements. In each of the Elemental Circles should be placed a Flashing Tablet of the appropriate Archangel. In th e midst of the Magic Circle should be a TAU cross of Ten squares. On the TIPHARETH square s hould be the Altar of the Universe, and on the MALKUTH square the Throne of t he Hierophant. The Throne is recommended largely due to the potentially exhausti ng nature of Evocation. The Magician may choose to avail himself of an Assistant to care for the Lamps and Censers and to keep the Implements available for the different stages o f the Working. If so, he may provide the Assistant with a small side table on the HOD Square . The Triangle of Evocation should be in the East bet ween the Pillars of Hermes, and the apex of the Triangle should touch the Circle of RAPHAEL. The area between the inner pair of concentric triangles should be yellow, and inscribed in purple Enochian letters with the Three Great Secret Names of God borne on the Ba nners of the East. In each angle should sit a yellow lamp. The Area between the oute r pair of triangles should be white, and inscribed in black Greek letters with the three Hol y Words PRIMEUMATON, ANEPHEXETON, and TETRAGRAMMATON. The area in the pa rallelograms located at the angles of the Triangle should be sky-blue and t he letters of the name RAPHAEL therein should be dark orange. In the midst of the innermos t Triangle should stand a Tripod to elevate the Material Basis.

FRATER S UB S PE In a Temple of the Grade of Neophyte, the Four Gods , Ameshet, Ahephi, Tmoumathph, Kabex nuf, said also to be Vice-gerants of the Elements, and answering to the Rivers of Eden as drawn in the War rant of the Temple, are said to rule in the four Corners of the Hall between the S t ations of the Kerubim. In Egyptian m ythology, these Gods are also said to be the Children of Horus, and to partake of his symbolism. If now, we regard the Neophyte Ceremony as representing the entrance into a new life, Regenera tion - Mors Janua Vitae - the Egyptian symbolism wherein that idea was so clearly and exactly worked out becomes important. Bear in mind that a new life mea ns a new plane or a higher world, a passing, sa y, from the Kether of Assiah to the Malkuth of Yetzirah. Now as behind Kether depend the Veils of the Negati ve Existence, Ain, Ain Soph and Ain Soph Aour, so through Negative Existen ce must pass the Soul that goes from Assiah to Yetzirah, or vice-versa. This proces s is illustrated by the Neophyte Ceremony as described in Z-3, and as seen b y the cl airvo yant e ye. In Eg yptian m ythology, the Dead, when the Ceremonies are comple te, the Soul weighed and passed, the Body mummied and preserved from corrupt ion, became one with Osiris, and is called an Osirian. Hence, the Hierophant, wh o represents Osiris when the Candidate is placed in the North, speaks to him in the character of his Higher S oul - \"The Voice of m y Higher S elf said unto me\" etc. Osiris, however, is a mummied form, and the body of the Egyptian dead was mummied at this part of the Ceremon y. Let us now co nsider the nature of the bod y which is mummied. The body itself may be considered as a vehicle whereby the life forces act, and the medium whereby these life-force s act is what are termed the Vital organs. Withdraw or destroy any of these, and the l ife ceases to function in that body. Not less important, then, than the body itself, the vehicle of the Soul, are the Organs, the media for the action of organic life, and it is equally important to preserve these from corruption, yet not together with the body. Fo r as the body of Osiris was broken up, so must the body of the Osirian be divided. Thi s is the meaning of the viscera being preserved apart from the bod y. The death and resurrection of Christ has other symb olisms and the teachings belong to a higher Grade. Let none therefore object that His Bod y was laid in the Tomb entire. The Body of Osiris was first laid in the Chest or P astos whole. The division into 14 parts was subsequent. Note that I plus 4 eq uals 5, the five wounds. For even as Yod Heh Vav Heh must be known before Yo d Heh Shin Vav Heh can be comprehended, and as Moses must precede Chri st, so must the Mysteries of Osiris first be known."},{"pageNumber":822,"pageContent":"VOLUME EIGHT 59 Now the Guardian of the Hall and of the Neophytes a gainst the Qlippoth (whose Kether is Thaumiel, the Dual or Two-headed O ne, the Demons of corruption and disintegration) is the Hiereus or Horus, and to the Children of Horus, who partake of his symbolism, are the viscera committed, to gua rd them against the demons of disintegration and corruption. As the elements and the forces of the Elements are to the world, so are the vital organs and the Life whi ch animates them to the human body. Appropriately, then, are the vital organs and the life which animates them, placed under the charge of the Vice-gerents of the Elements, the Children of Horus, the Great Gods Ameshet, Ahephi, Tmoumathph and Kabe xnuf, who regulate their functions in material life, and guard them after so -called death, when the man that was has become an Osirian. Consider then, what are these vital organs and thei r functions. Broadly the y may be divided into the alimentary system and the c irculatory system, for in this classification we take no account of the brain or r eproductive organs which belong to another classification, and are not Elemental nor c oncerned in the maintenance of the life of the material body. Each of these divisions may be further divided into that which divides or distributes to the body - that which is needed for life, and that which casts out from the body and renders to the Qlippoth that which is unne cessary or pernicious. From this arises a four-fold division as in the following: A. is the receptive aspect of the Alimentary system. B. is the excretory aspect of the Alimentary system. C. is the receptive aspect of the Circulatory system . D. is the excretory aspect of the Circulatory system . With this Key, the division becomes easy, for in th e Alimentary System, the stomach and the upper intestines divide the food ta ken into the system by a process called digestion, and by assimilation retain what i s necessary. This therefore is \"A\" in the above. But the lower intestines receive and cas t out that which is rejected. These therefore will be represented by \"13.\" In the circu latory system, the heart is the organ which distributes the blood which it receives washe d and purified by the lungs. Hence the lungs and heart are represented by \"C.\" T he matter rejected from the circulatory system is rejected and cast forth by th e liver and gall-bladder, which therefore will be represented by \"D.\" Now as to the treatment of these vital organs in th e process of mummification. Insofar as during life they were under the guardian ship of the Great Gods mentioned, so in death they were dedicated each to one of thes e, who were the four Genii of the Underworld or the Lesser Gods of the Dead. These vital organs then, being taken out and separa tely embalmed, were placed in egg-shaped receptacles, symbolic of Akasa . They were under the care of Canopus, the Pilot of Menelaus, and the God of the Waters of Creation, the Eternal Source of Being, whose symbol was a jar. These were under the protection of that one of the Genii of the Underworld or Vice-gerents of the Elements to whom that particular organ was dedicated. Hence each egg-shap ed package was enclosed in a jar whose lid was shaped like the head of that God."},{"pageNumber":823,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 60 Now Ameshet was also termed \"The Carpenter\" for he it is who by the medium of his organ, the Stomach, frames the rough materials and builds up the structure of the body; to him the Stomach and Upper Intestines were dedicated (A). Ahephi was also termed \"The Digger\" or \"Burier\" for he puts out of sight or removes that which is useless or offensive in the b ody, and to him the Lower Intestines or Bowels were dedicated (B). Tmoumathph was also called \"The Cutter\" or \"Divider \" for he divides and distributes the blood bearing with it the P rana and the Subtle Ether b y the Hol y S cience of Breath brought into the bod y, and to him were the lungs or heart dedicated (C). Kabexnuf was termed \"The Bleeder\" for as a stream o f blood is drawn from the body, so is a stream of impurity drawn from the blo od, and cast out into the draught by the action of the Li ver and Gall-Bladder. To him therefore, these organs were dedicated (D). These jars were called Canopic J ars and were arrang ed in a certain order round the Mumm y. Consider now, the points of the co mpass to which they would naturally be attributed. Reason itself will insist that the organs of the Alimentary S ystem, the most material and earthy, should be in the North. The warm and vital heat of the Circulatory S ystem should be to the Sou th. In the following tables, the Receptive and Distributive organs should be placed to the East, the source of Life and Light, and the organs that purify and cast out shou ld be to the W est that borders on the Qlippoth. This gives us the following arrangement: Ameshet -- Northeast quadrant. (Stomach and Upper I ntestines). Ah ephi -- Northw est q uad ran t. (Bow els). Tmoumathph -- Southeast quadrant. (Heart and Lungs) . Kabexnuf -- Southwest quadrant. (Liver and Gall-Bladder). Yet this arrangement, would, as it were, s ymbolise the entire separation of the Alimentar y S yste m and the Circulator y S ystem, w hich is contrar y to Nature, for the y continually counterchange, and thus arises Lif e. Wherefore in the Hall of the Two Truths, the portions of Ahephi and Kabex nuf are reversed, and the order becomes. EAST -- Amesh et. SOUTH -- Tmoumathph. NORTH -- Kabexnuf . WEST -- Ah e p hi. Now these, being thus arranged, do partake of the s ymbolism of the elements to which the y belong. For Ameshet being to the East , the quarter of Air, has the head of a Man. Tmoumathph, to the South, has the he ad of a Jackal who is the purveyor of the Lion (for these are the Vice-Gerent s of the Elements, while the Kerubim are the Lords thereof); so Tmoumathph is pr operly a jackal. Kabexnuf in the West, in the region of Water, has the form of a Hawk, the subordinate form to the Alchemic Eagle of Distillation, and the form"},{"pageNumber":824,"pageContent":"VOLUME EIGHT 61 also, of Horus, the Hiereus, beside whom is his sta tion, and of whose symbolism he partakes. Ahephi in the North, has the head of an Ape. The sy mbolism of the Ape in ancient Egypt is very complex. Here it may be taken that while Apis, the Bull, represents the Divine Strength of the Eternal Gods, the Ape represents the Elemental Strength which is far inferior and blended with cun ning. Ahephi, however, has other symbolism and other attributes. For by reason of th e fertilising qualities of the Nile and of the fact that what is brought down by the Ni le as refuse from the Land of the Sacred Lakes is, to Egypt, its life and the source of its fertility, so there arises a correspondence between the Nile and the lower intes tines. Both are under the care of Ahephi (Hapi) who thus was worshipped as Nilus, and in this connection he has for his symbol, a head-dress of Lotus Flowers. Now, further, the Alimentary S ystem is under the sp ecial guardianship of Isis and Nephthys. Isis who conquers by the power of Wis dom and the forces of Nature, guards Ameshet. And Nephthys who hides that which i s secret, guards Ahephi - whence also, until recent days, in the fulness of T ime, the sacred sources of Ahephi, the Nile, were kept secret from the whole world. Tmoumathph is under the guardianship of Neith, the Dawn. This is the Celestial Space, who makes the Morning to pass and awakes the Light of a Golden Dawn in the Heart of Him whom the Eternal Gods shal l choose, by the Sacred Science of the Breath. Kabexnuf is guarded by Sekhet, the Sun at the Weste rn Equinox, the Opening of Amenti, who wears the Scorpion on her head. Thes e guardianships were often painted on the Canopic jars. When, therefore, the Candidate kneels at the foot o f the Altar, or where the Corpse lies on the Bier preparatory to the passing over the River towards the West, there the Soul stands before Osiris, and the Goddes ses stand by and watch while the Beam sways and the decision is taken. Then, the bod y of the Candidate is, as it were, broken up as the body of Osiris was broken, and the Higher Self stands before the place of the Pillars, but the lower self is in the invisible station of the evil persona. Then is the Candidate nigh unto death, for then, sy mbolically, his Spirit passes through the Veils of the Negative Existence, passin g from the Kether of Assiah to the Malkuth of Yetzirah. Therefore, unless the Genii of the Underworld were then present and directing their forces on the vital organs, he must inevitably die. Let their symbols then be represented in all operat ions and formulae drawn from the symbolism of the Hall of the Two Truths, f or they are of the utmost importance, but as their stations are Invisible, so shall their symbols be astral and not material. Thus shall perfect health of body be preserved, whi ch is of utmost importance in all magical working, and thus shall the lessons of the Hall of the Neophytes be duly carried out in our daily life."},{"pageNumber":825,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 62 The stations of the God-forms used in our symbolism come under two heads: 1. Visible Stations. 2. Invisible Stations. The Visible Stations are the places of the Officers , each of whom has a special astral shape suitable to the forces he repr esents. On the Dais are places for the Three Chiefs, the Pa st Hierophant and the Hierophant. The order in which they sit (as you fac e East) is: Imperator-Nephthys Cancellarius-Thoth Hierophant-Osiris Past Hierophant-Aroueris Praemonstrator-lsis These names are those of the God-forms they represe nt. The following are the descriptions of the God-forms of the seven Officers of the Neophyte Grade. Hierophant: Osiris in the Underworld. Expounder of the Mysteries in the Hall of the Dual Manifestation of the Goddess of Truth. Hierophant is represented by two God-forms, the pas sive and active aspects of Osiris. Seated on the Dais as Hierophant. he is clo thed in the God-form of Osiris. He wears the tall white crown of the South, flanked by feathers striped white and blue. His face is green, the eyes blue, and from his chin hangs the royal beard of authority and judgment, blue in colour and gold tipped.

He is in mummy wrappings to the feet, but hi s hands are free to hold a golden Phoenix Wand, a Blue Crook and Red Scourge. The han ds are green. His feet rest on a pavement of black and white. The God-form of Osiris never moves from the Dais. W hen the Hierophant has to move from the Dais, he is covered by the form of Osiris in action - Aroueris, which is built up by the Past Hierophant, seated on Hiero phant's left. If no one is seated as Past Hierophant, then inner Order Members help the Hierophant to formulate the second God-form. Aroueris, Horus the Elder, is very lively to look u pon - like pure flames. He wears the Double Crown of Egypt, the cone shaped cr own in red inside the white crown of the North, with a white plume. His nemyss is purple banded with gold at the edges. His face and body are translucent scarlet. H e has green eyes and wears a purple beard of authority. He wears a yellow tunic with a waist cloth of yellow striped with purple, from which depends a lion's tail. In common with all Egyptian Gods, he has a white linen kilt showing like an apron under the co loured waist cloth."},{"pageNumber":826,"pageContent":"VOLUME EIGHT 63 His armlets and anklets are of gold.

The Kerub of Air is formed beh ind Hathor and she is a power of Hathor, and has the same general colouring . She has a young girl's countenance and behind her are spread large and sha dowing wings. The Kerub of Fire is in the South beyond the seat o f Dadouchos. It is a power of the great Goddess Tharpesh, and has the face and fo rm of a Lion with large and clashing wings. The colouring is ver y lively and fl ashing Leo gr een with rub y and flame-blue and Emerald green. The Kerub of Water is formed behind Hiereus and is a power of the great God Toum or Tmu.

The Letters may be of one or of several Alphabets, and the numerical values and Yetziratic attributions may be also added. In all c ases care should be taken that the proper coloured Ray leads from the White Center to the Let ter to which that colour is attributed. The Ring should be made of convenient size, and may be made (like the Disc) of any convenient material; thick pasteboard will do. It s hould not be too light, or the elasticity of the thread employed may vitiate its action. In the diag ram the Ring is represented too large. It should be coloured appropriately, having the letters of EH EIEH in White upon both sides. Within the inner circle upon one side should be written in bla ck upon the white ground the Motto of the Theoricus, and on the other side the title “Perecli nus de Faustis.” The thread may be of linen, silk, or of cotton, and preferably White, though fo r a particular purpose a special colour may be used, as for working a Fire invokation, Red thread may be used. (Hair is too springy and has a personal element. Iron or steel wire for Martial pu rposes. Brass or Copper wire for Venusian purposes. N. 0. M.) But usually white answers all p urposes. The part of the Ring to which the thread is fastene d should be white, and is considered as the top of the Ring. The left hand line of the “A” ray of the Disc is considered as the top of the Disc, and not the Kether segment, because this work ing is more naturally allied to the Paths than to the Sephiroth. OF THE METHOD OF WORKING Now when the Theoricus Adept shall desire to employ the Disc and Ring for the purposes of Divination or of Consultation, let him - wearing the Insignia and having his necessary magical implements at hand - invoke in the ordinary manner the particular Spirit, Force or Elemental whom he wisheth to consult. (Note by N.0.M. “By mea ns of a Telesma if desired. Put names, seal and sigil of Force on one side, and the name o f THMAH on the other.”) Let him place the Disc flat upon the table before h im. The Top thereof, i.e., the left hand line of the “A” ray being always opposite to him, t hen, leaning the elbow of the arm of the hand, by which he holds the thread attached to the Ring, upon the table for the sake of steadiness, let him so hold the Ring as to be suspended exactly abo ve the White Center of the Disc, directing his gaze to the same point.

The Ring will soon commence to oscillate and to vibrate. The mode of receiving a communication thereby is as follows. No notice is to be taken of a short oscillation that does not pass completely b eyond the circle of colored rays on to the circle of letters. But if it goeth clearly on to the circl e of letters, such letters are to be taken in"},{"pageNumber":835,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 72 order, as spelling out a word or a sentence. When t he Ring circleth, or oscillateth to the right hand (or with the Sun’s course) it meaneth “Yes”; b ut if it circleth to the left hand (against the course of the Sun) it meaneth “No”: and if it conti nueth to oscillate vaguely it meaneth “Doubtful”. The point of suspension of the Ring must be careful ly maintained exactly above the center of the Disc. To avoid self-deception, and un til facility of action be attained, care should be taken that the hand should be kept as steady as pos sible; and every communication should be carefully tested (as in Skrying) to avoid either au tomatic self-deception or wilful deception, by either the Force invoked, or by a hostile Force end eavoring to cut between, and thus to vitiate the operation. Also, it should be clearly understood beforehand wh at language is being employed, and if a numerical value be intended instead of the Letter thereto belonging. And it is for the purpose of protecting against deception, and of identifying th e Operator with the operation, that the Divine Names and the Motto of the Theoricus are placed upo n the Disc and the Ring. OF THE CONSECRATION OF THE DISC AND THE RING A Golden Dawn Altar being prepared in the usual way, the Cross and Triangle upon it arranged with the Cross within the Triangle as in t he Grade of Zelator, the room is purified and consecrated, etc. (Note by N.O.M. “Fire, Air, Water , three circles on altar, or the three elements. Open as in the 1-10 Grade; or in the full consecrat ion formula as given in the Rituals of the Rose-Cross, the Lotus Wand and Elemental Implements . Use both Lesser Banishing Rituals of both the Pentagram and Hexagram. The four magical i mplements might be put on the Altar. The Pentacle is placed in the middle as the synthesis w ith Dagger, Cup and Wand around it.) Lay the Disc upon the Cross and Triangle, the left hand lin e of the Segment corresponding with the Eastern Arm of the Cross; lay the Ring upon the exa ct center of the Disc, its point of suspension (where the thread is attached) corresponding with t he left hand line of the “A” segment of the Disc. Coil the thread around it in a spiral form in the direction of the course of the Sun, laying upon the coloured parts of the Disc. Place the Less er Magical Implements around it at the usual angles or sides. Stand at the West of the Altar, The Altar and place s of the Pillars should be arranged as for the 1-10 Grade of Zelator. Hold the Magical Swo rd in the left hand and the Lotus Wand by the black part in the right hand, so that the pomme l of the Sword and the black part of the Wand shall be immediately above the left and right hand outer edges of the Disc respectively. The point of the Sword and the Lotus end of the Wand shall be joined together perpendicularly above the centers of the Ring and the Disc. In this position, rehearse any convenient Oration to the Divine Powers ruling the Paths and the Sephiroth, asking t hat the Power of Truth may be conferred upon the Disc and the Ring."},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"VOLUME EIGHT 73 Lay down the Lotus Wand on the right side of the Di sc, and lay the Sword down upon the left of the Disc and Ring.

THE PHILOSOPHICAL EXPOSITION OF THE WORKING OF THE RING AND THE DISC Let the Theoricus Adeptus Minor recall that which w as said in the lecture on the Microcosm, under the headings of “How the Spiritual Consciousness can act around and beyond the Sphere of Sensation,” and “Of Travelling in the Spirit Vision.” In the working by the Ring and Disc then, the Opera tor buildeth up partly from his own Nephesch and partly from the surrounding atmosphere a species of truncated cone of astral light. The Disc is its base, while the truncated summit th ereof is at the point of suspension of the Ring where the thread thereof passeth between the thumb and finger of the Operator. The action of the Will of the Operator in formulating his desire of c ommunication buildeth up the symbol of a receptacle of impressions. This will take the form of another inverted cone rising from the point of suspension of the Ring. So that upon the Disc as a base there will be built up in the astral light a form somewhat resembling an hourglass of which th e center will be the place of the finger and the thumb of the Operator, holding the thread of su spension of the Ring. And from the impressions received by the conical receptacle, the hand will translate into action in the lower cone the expression of these ideas, in words and se ntences spelled out by the movements of the Ring over the letters of the Disc. But were it an uninitiated person who attempted thi s form of Divination or of consultation, he or she, being ignorant of the form ulas involved, would almost to a certainty open a conical receptacular funnel in the sphere of sens ation (of him or her) thus preparing a ready path unto obession. Therefore, it is not entirely t he Force invoked which actually spells out the words, but to a great extent it is the Operator him self who translates"},{"pageNumber":837,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 74 his own impressions thereof. And for this reason it is that this form of Divination is not taught unto the Zelator Adept, self-deception therein bein g so extremely easy, and the hand being liable to translate that which the heart wisheth. Therefore it is also that the language wherein the communication is received need not necessarily be that in which the Force invoked woul d speak, supposing it to be endowed with the human organs of speech, but the impression received by the Operator is translated according to the understanding of the Operator. And all this is in accordance with the degree of Force respectively exercised in the Upper or in the Lower Cone. CONCERNING THE USE OF THE FORMATION OF A VACUUM IN THE ATMOSPHERE TO AID SKRYING AND RECEIVING OF IDEAS IN MAGICAL WORKING The first and most important point is the formation of a cone, and from that a vortex, the center of which is then first to be extended upward s and downwards, thus forming the outline of a sphere enclosed by a Whorl, increasing at the cir cumference, diminishing towards and terminating at the Poles: From the Poles, two rays of communication converge to a focus on the Sphere of Sensation. This Sphere thus artificially constructe d enclosing a vacuum becometh naturally a reflection of the Universe. Therefore, anything tha t the Operator may will to see clearly is sympathetically reflected therein. Therefore, let the Adept then command that which he is to see, to manifest therein. But if it be an Elemental or Spirit of a material or of an evil nature, let him guard carefully against being obsessed thereby seeing that the entering of it into that Sphere may give it a certain hold upon his own Sphere of Sensation, and when he hath gained his end, let him banish, command or license the Force summoned to depart, then reverse the process of construction and withdaw the Whorl into his Sphere and carefully close the latte r at that point. OF THE OPERATION KNOWN ANCIENTLY AS THE MAGICAL CONSULTATION BY MEANS OF THE TRIPOD (AND WITHIN RECENT YEARS REV IVED IN A MISTAKEN FORM AMONG THE UNINITIATED UNDER THE TITLES OF SPIRITUALISM AND TABLETURNING) Now if the Theoricus Adeptus Minor shall wish to em ploy the Magical Consultation with the Tripod or table with three feet, let him know t hat the model thereof is the circular"},{"pageNumber":838,"pageContent":"VOLUME EIGHT 75 Altar of the Vault of Christian Rosenkreutz. One le g of the table should coincide with the Eastern point of the top which later should be colo ured in exact representation of the Altar, and the legs should be black. (A table may have the reg ular painted top, and others removable, painted for special purposes. N.O.M.) If desired, t he magical Operator, the better to isolate him or herself, may trace any convenient magical circle of defence upon the floor (consonant with the force he desires to invoke) wherein to sit while em ploying the working of the Tripod. (Note: A circle may consist of a tape and on it at certain p laces, Telesma or pentacles may be placed. N.O. M.) The mode of Operation is as here followeth. The table should be placed with the same orientatio n as the Altar in the Vault; one leg, which we will call the apex of the triangle formed by the legs, being placed at the Eastern point as regards the design upon the top thereof. The Ope rator will usually, if working alone, find it best to be seated either at the Western part of the table, or at the point immediately opposite to that of the Force to be evoked. Let him then place his hands on the top of the table towards each side thereof. After a certain time, the length of w hich will depend upon varying conditions, the Tripod will begin to tilt up and down; and in some cases even a species of explosive knocks may be heard, which ariseth from a more sudden transmis sion of astral force from the cone of reception to the table. Now remember that the movem ents of the table should be really the combined product of the Operator and the communicat ing Force, always supposing that the Operator be not obsessed by the Force invoked, nor voluntarily self-deceiving. And the philosophical explanation is of a similar principle to that of the Disc and Ring: only that in this instance self-deception is even yet more easy. For the reception of communications by the Tripod s ome convenient preconceived plan of correspondences between the tilts of the table a nd the letters of the alphabet or simple words should be employed. This form of magical operation is usually found to be more exhausting than the employment of the Ring and Disc, seeing that a grea ter amount of astral Force has to be employed in the operation. Not only one but several persons may take part in this operation by the Tripod, but in such cases they should partition among them the points of the table corresponding either to their natures, or to the Fo rces with which each intendeth to ally himself. If there be three persons, let them take Air, Fire and Water, leaving Earth vacant. If five persons, the Spirit and the four elements, the Spirit being at the point of the East. If six or seven persons the points of the hexagram and so on, according to the quarters that they occupy, so as always to form some intentionally and not accidentally equili brated symbol. Now in the case of several persons taking part, each one will form his own con e. The synthesis will form together another Great Cone enclosing the whole, and so a large amou nt of force may be thus obtained. But also, careful watch should be kept against both obsession and self-deception. The greatest harmony should prevail among the Opera tors for the least discordant feeling will produce some error or disruption. And remember that in working with the"},{"pageNumber":839,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 76 Tripod the cone of reception will attract any passi ng Intelligence or Force. Thus, without the greatest care, much deception could arise, and even against the intention of the communicating Intelligence deception may result through confused mistranslations by the Operator or Operators. Results may be obtained from tables not circular in form, and having four or more legs. But the Tripod is the best form. Also the Ring and the Disc may be used in conjunction with the Tripod. In invocation, a flashing Tablet or Tablets of the nature of the Force to be invoked may be placed upon the table. Also by using the table a s a physical basis of strength, and sitting thereat, even physical appearances and manifestatio ns may be produced. In such a case it may advantageous to have black drapery fastened around the edge of the table (not covering the table top, for this would hide the symbols. S.R.M.D.) and reaching to the ground, so as to form, as it were a cylindrical receptacle of force extending fr om the top of the table to the floor. Such drapery should be in three divisions. Or three slit s may be cut, one by each leg from the top of the table to the floor, so that the three are unite d only along the edge of the table top. In all such operations let the greatest care be tak en to combat obsession, for in case of this arriving, although occasionally striking physical r esults may ensue, yet there will be danger therewith. And the result of such obsession will al ways be to make the Operator personate and imitate the action of the Force evoked, even to the extent of attempting to deceive both himself and those who may be with him. But the Theoricus Adeptus Minor hath sufficient kno wledge to know what to do, and what to avoid herein, and when. Now the Formula of this operation by the Tripod wil l be closely similar to that contained in the Pyramid and Sphynx Formula of the Enochian T ablets. The truncated cone will answer to the Pyramid, with a cone of reception above opening therefrom to attract the Force which shall act through the top thereof. The surface of the tab le will answer to the place of the Sphynx. And thus thou wilt easily see how particular the Op erator must always be in discerning the Force which is acting through the vortex above."},{"pageNumber":840,"pageContent":"VOLUME EIGHT 77"},{"pageNumber":841,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 78"},{"pageNumber":842,"pageContent":"VOLUME EIGHT 79"},{"pageNumber":843,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 1 VOLUME NINE THE TAROT THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF THE TAROT This includes Documents N, O, P, Q, R, and an Unlet tered Theoricus Adeptus Minor Paper THE GREAT ANGEL HRU IS SET OVER THE OPERATION OF THIS SECRET WISDOM “What thou seest write in a Book, and send it unto the Seven Abodes that are in Assiah.” “And I saw in the right hand of Him that sat upon t he Throne a book sealed with Seven Seals.

They rep resent the Yod forces of the Name in each suit, the Radix, Father, and commencement of Materi al Forces. A Force in which all the others are implied and of which they form the development and completion. A force swift and violent in action, but whose effect soon passes away, and t herefore symbolised by a figure on a steed riding swiftly, and clothed in complete armour. Therefore is the knowledge of the scale of the King so necessary for the commencement of all magical working. THE FOUR QUEENS Are seated upon Thrones, representing the Forces of Heh of the Name in each suit, the Mother, and bringer forth of material Force, a Forc e which develops, and realises the Force of the King. A force steady and unshaken, but not rapi d though enduring.

A prince, the son of a King and Queen, yet a Prince of Princes, and a King of Kings . An Emperor, whose effect is at once rapid (though not so swift as that of a king) and endurin g (though not as steadfast as that of a queen). It is therefore symbolised by a figure borne in a char iot, and clothed with armour. Yet is his power illusionary, unless set in motion by his Father and Mother. THE FOUR PRINCESSES These are also known as the Knaves.

This is the Plan et Mars which is allotted the last decan of Pisces and first of Aries, because the long cold of the winter requires a great energy to overcome it and initiate spring. The beginning of the decanates is from the Royal Ki ng Star of the Heart of the Lion, the great star Cor Leonis, and therefore is the first d ecanate that of Saturn in Leo. Here follow the general meanings of the small cards of the Suits, as classified under the Nine Sephiroth below Kether.

Here finishes the description of the 36 smaller car ds, referring to the 3O Dccanates of the Zodiac. Although the Angels of the Schem ha-mephore sch have been linked with the Decanates, yet their dominion is far more exalted, extended, a nd important than this would at first sight seem to imply. In all of this I have not only trans cribed the symbolism, but have tested, studied, compared, and examined it both clairvoyantly and in other ways. The result of these has been to show me how absolutely correct the symbolism of the Book T is, and how exactly it represents the occult Forces of the Universe. TAROT DIVINATION This form is especially applicable to Divination co ncerning the ordinary material events of daily life."},{"pageNumber":872,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 30 It is a mode of placing the cards based upon the sc heme of the dominion of the Tarot Symbols. The more rigidly correct and in harmony wi th the scheme of the Universe is any form of Divination, so much the more is it likely to yie ld a correct and reliable answer to the enquirer. For then and then only is there a firm link, and bo nd of union, established between it and the Occult forces of Nature. The moment the correct cor respondence of the Symbols employed ceases to be observed, the link between them and th e inner Occult forces is strained, and in some cases broken. For this cause, therefore, is it that the same mode of Divination will sometimes yield a true and sometimes false answer, and at oth er times a partly true and partly false; because the correspondences are either not rigidly observed or else made use of by an ignorant and uninitiated person. Therefore the Diviner should enter upon the Divinat ion with a mind clear and unprejudiced, neither disturbed by anger, fear, nor love, and with a sound knowledge of the correspondences of the symbols which he employs. Al so he should be able to employ his clairvoyant and intuitive faculties therein when ne cessary and should avoid as much as possible a warped or strained decision. Also it is not well to divine repeatedly concerning the same matter; and the Diviner should also recognise that even the material occult forces do not act as the instruments of a blind fatality, but rather in acco rdance with the will of the more spiritual powers which are behind them. Also it may be well for the Diviner to put on his i nsignia, and make over the pack any invoking hexagram or pentagram, either with the han d alone, or with convenient magical instruments. And it may also be advisable in some i nstances to invoke an elemental force consonant with the matter, to aid in the divination . And let it not be forgotten that in working with th e lesser magical implements all four should be at hand, even though only one be actually employed. For if this be not done, it will give undue force to the suit corresponding to the E lement invoked, and instead of being an aid in the matter, it will be a hindrance to correct readi ng. THE OPENING OF THE KEY The mode of performing the Divination called “The O pening of the Key” is by five consecutive operations of laying out the cards, the y having been previously well shuffled, and, in addition in the first and fourth cases, having been cut as well, and in a certain manner. These five operations answer respectively, the first to the Do minion of the Four Knaves under the presidency of the Four Aces; the Second to that of the Kings, Queens and Knights, referred to the Twelve Houses; the Third to that of the Twelve Keys attributed to the Signs; the Fourth to that of the smaller cards answering to the 36 Decanates; an d the Fifth and last to the rule of the Sephiroth in the Celestial Heavens. These are five distinct operations, consecutively e xecuted from the mode of Operation called the “Opening of the Key,” which, as has been before said, is especially applicable to the daily events of life. The first of these methods sh ows the opening of the matter as it then stands. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, its consecutive development, and the 5th its termination."},{"pageNumber":873,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 31 Before commencing the Divination, one of the sixtee n court cards should be selected to represent the significator of the enquirer, and sho uld answer as nearly to his description. WANDS generally - very fair-haired and red-haired p ersons with fair complexion. CUPS generally - moderately fair persons. SWORDS generally - dark persons. PENTACLES generally - very dark persons. KINGS - Generally men. QUEENS - Generally women. KNIGHTS - Generally young men. PAGES (KNAVES) - generally young women. Of these the Queens and Knights in reading the card s during the processes almost always represent persons connected with a matter under con sideration. The Kings, if looking against the direction of the reading, or if meeting it, represe nt the coming of a person or event, or phase of an event, but if looking with the direction of the reading represent the departure of a person or the going off or wane of some event. The Pages (Knaves) if looking with the direction of the reading, represent general opinion in harmony with, and approving of the matter; but i f looking against the direction of the reading the reverse. If the Diviner be performing the Divination for a p erson at a distance and of whose general description he is ignorant, he can select t he significator by cutting the pack, and taking one of the court cards of that suit, cut to represe nt him, of course earnestly thinking of the person at the time. It is usually much better for the Enquirer to shuff le or cut the cards himself; but if the Diviner should have to do this himself, he must, wh ile doing so, earnestly think of the person enquiring, or concerning whom the Divination is per formed. In all cases of shuffling and cutting, the person doing so should think earnestly of the m atter in hand. In cutting, if a false cut be made, that is to say if one or more cards should dr op in the process, the cards should be at once reshuffled, and again cut clearly, otherwise it is probable that the answer will be unreliable. If the matter be important, he should wait twelve hours be fore reshuffling. In the laying out of the Cards, if any are inverted , they must remain so and must not be turned round, as that would alter the direction in which they would be looking. A card has the same meaning and forces, whether right side up or i nverted, so that no particular attention need be paid to the circumstances. The order of the cards as laid down must also not b e interfered with. In the reading of the cards when laid out, the Significator of the Enquir er is the starting point, and reading proceeds by counting over certain cards in the direction in whi ch the face of the Court card chosen as Significator of the Enquirer is turned."},{"pageNumber":874,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 32 AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF SELECTING THE SIGNIFICATOR By C.S. HYATT (In 1963 by chance 1 met a lady who sought employme nt as a part-time baby sitter. After a few months of employment she introduced me to the T arot system, which from this point of time seems similar to if not identical with the Gol den Dawn System herein described. However she used a different method of determining the significator, using both astrology and numerology. First she requested the birth data. From this she d etermined if the sign was either Fire, Water, Air or Earth. She attributed Wands to Fire, Cups to Water, Swords to Air, and Pentacles to Earth. For example, November 17, 1907, would be (11-17-1907). First this querent would be a Cup since Scorpio is the Sun sig n in early November. Next she would simply add the numbers together giving a total of 4 5. This number would be reduced to a number from two to ten (excluding the number one) i n this case giving the number 9. So that the significator is the 9 of Cups which is the Lord of Material Happiness.) Now we may return to the official document of D.D.C.F. The mode of counting is as follows, recognising the card from which one starts as the No. 1. From every Ace—Five cards (spirit and four elements ). Princess (Knave) —Seven cards (seven palaces of Mal kuth). King, Queen, Prince—Four cards, (letters of Tetragr ammaton). Smaller cards—Its own number (a Sephirah). Key of Aleph Mem Shin—Three cards (number of the Mo ther letters). Key of duplicated letters—Nine cards (number of pla nets and Caput and Cauda Draconis). Key of single letters Twelve (number of signs). The counting is continued till one alights on a car d which has already been read. Thus, in the following example, we will suppose tha t the significator is the Queen of Cups, and that she is looking to the left. We shoul d read as follows: Queen of Cups—a fair woman; counting four, we come to Five of Pentacles, Le. “Loss of money” and as it has on one side the Moon and on the other a card of Pentacles, it shows that it is through deception in business matters,) we then count 5, the number of t he card, from the 5 of Pentacles, which falls on the 6 of Cups “Success.” But as this has on one side the Foolish Man, and on the other the Ace of Wands, this will not be great owing to unwis e conduct. Then we count six from the 6 of Cups, still going in the same direction which bring s us to the Queen of Cups, a card we have already read, so we finish there."},{"pageNumber":875,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 33 S IGNIFICATOR - QUEEN OF CUPS Thus the reading will be \" A rather fair woman has l ost money through some cheating in business, and though she is again begin ning to succeed, this success is liable to be damaged by unwise conduct on her part for which she will have herself to thank.\" If the significator were the Knave of Wands, and (l ooking towards the right) we should count seven to the 2 of Pentacles, then two from that to the 5 of Pentacles. Then five from that to the Hierophant, twelve from that to the Queen of Cups, four from that to the King of Pentacles. Then four to th e Foolish Man, and thence three to the 2 of Pentacles, where we stop, having read t hat card alread y. The interpretation given is: \"A young woman is just mak ing a change in her business, which brings her loss of money through some deceit on the part of a fair woman and a dark man whose foolish advice has led to the change .\" The cards would then be paired two by two, from opposite ends as hereafter shown, (as in a horseshoe) thus: Moon and Tower, etc. From the Moon and the Tower, \"The deceit is discove red.\" 3 of Pentacles and Queen of Cups, \"On the part of this person who has brought about her loss.\" 2 of P entacles and Hierophant, \"by advising the change.\" Knight of Cups and Knight of W ands, \"for the you ng woman meets an older man,\" Ki ng of P entacles and Fool \"who counteract the foolish advice of the dark man. \" Ace of Wands and 6 of Cups \"and she in conseqúence succeeds better, but onl y b y the dint of energy and hard work.\" The scheme of Divination called \"The Opening of the Key\" is worked out in the following manner. 1 adjoin an example carried caref ully through the five stages for the instruction of the Z.A.M.

FIRST OPERATION REPRESENTING THE OPENING OF THE QUESTION The significator being chosen, the enquirer shuffle s the cards, thinking earnestly of the matter under consideration. He then places the card s in a single packet on the table before"},{"pageNumber":876,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 34 him, face downwards. This represents the Name YHVH, which is now to be separated into the component letters. He therefore is to cut the pack as nearly in the middle as his eye can direct, and to face the uppermost portion to the right of t he lowermost; the former will represent YH and the latter VH (final). He again is to cut the right hand packet into two parts, as nearly in the centre as he can, and place the uppermost part to t he right again. This will represent Y and the lower part the remaining H. He is now to cut the le ft hand packet to the left, its uppermost part will represent V and its lower part H (final). So t hat he will now have four packets nearly equal in size, answering from right to left to the name Y HVH under the presidency of the Four Princesses (knaves) and through them to the four ra dical forces (Aces). These four packets are then turned face upwards without altering their rel ative position, and the meaning of their four bottom cards (which are now uppermost) thus shown m ay be read as an indication of the matter. Each packet is now examined to find where the Signi ficator of the Enquirer is, being careful not to alter the order of the Cards. The packet contain ing the Significator is retained for reading, and the others are put aside and not used in this parti cular reading (operation). Carefully note to which of the Four letters the packet containing the significator of the Enquirer corresponds. If to Y and Wands, energy and strife. If to H and Cups, p leasure. If to V and Swords, sickness and trouble. If to H final and Pentacles, business and money. The packet containing the significator is now spread out face upwards in the form of a horses hoe (count in the way the Significator looks) and its meaning is read in the manner previously de scribed. First by counting to certain cards until one alight s upon that which has been previously read; and then by pairing them together in successi on from opposite ends of the horseshoe. (You do not miss the significator.) Before commencing counting from the Significator, t he Diviner should first notice what suit predominates in the number of cards. In this a majority of Wands would signify energy, quarrelling, opposition. Of Cups, pleasure and merr iment. Of Swords, trouble and sadness, sometimes sickness and death. Of Pentacles, busines s, money, possession, etc. Also if in the cards laid out there should be either three or four cards of a sort, such as 3 Aces, 4 Fives, etc., their meaning should be noted according to the tabl e hereafter given. A majority of the Trumps (Major Arcana) shows forces beyond one’s control. Supposing that a young man asks the question “Shall I succeed in my present affairs?” His complexion is fair, and his hair light brown. T he Diviner therefore takes the Knight of Cups for Significator. (Had he been an older man he woul d have selected the King of the same suit instead) and requests Enquirer to carefully shuffle the pack and place it face downwards on the table before him. He then instructs him to cut the pack as nearly in the centre as possible, and to place the uppermost half well to the right. Then to cut each of the packets as nearly in the centre as possible, putting each uppermost half to the rig ht of and beside the lower half, thus yielding four packets of nearly equal dimensions. "},{"pageNumber":877,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 35 Here the 10 of Wands is strong, being in the place of Yod which governs Wands - Fire. The Six of Swords is moderately strong, being in th e place of Heh which rules Cups - Water, which is not a hostile and contrary element to Air; the 4 of Pentacles is weak because it is in the place of Vau which rules the contrary element to Ea rth, viz. Air; and the Chariot, Cancer, a watery sign, is fairly strong, being in the place o f Heh final, which rules Earth, a friendly element to Water. The Diviner then reads these 4 Cards as a prelimina ry thus: “The Enquirer works very hard and gains but little money, yet matters are be ginning to improve.” This is based on the 10 of Wands showing cruelty, harshness, etc. 6 of Swords labour and work. 4 of Pentacles gain of money, and the Chariot success. The Diviner then examines the Four Packets to find where the Significator is. It proves to be in the one of which the 6 of Swords is the botto m card. This is in the place answering to the letter Heh, which represents pleasure and rules Cup s. This is so far a good omen, as it shows society and merriment. This pack of cards is retain ed for reading, the others are put aside as not bearing on the question. Let us suppose that this packet consists of 20 card s, and that they are in the following order. The Diviner spreads them out in the form of a horseshoe: "},{"pageNumber":878,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 36 The suit of Cups is distinctly in the majority - pl easure, visiting friends, love-making, etc. There are 3 Knaves which indicates society of the y oung. From which the Diviner reads that the Enquirer is fond of young people and of flirting, e tc. There being no other set of 3 or 4 cards of a sort, the Diviner proceeds to read by counting from the Significator, whose face is turned towards the 9 of Wands. The counting therefore proceeds in the direction of the arrow, thus: 4 from the King of Cups, 10 of Pentacles, 10 from this, 8 of Cups. 8 f rom this, Wheel of Fortune. 9 from this, Knave of Wands, 7 from this, 10 of Cups. 10 from this, 5 of Swords. 5 from this, Knight of Wands. 4 from this, Ace of Pentacles. 5 from this, 10 of Cup s. And as this card has already been taken, this form of reading finishes here. In this reading as hereafter explained, each card i s modified by the card on either side of it. If it be an end card, such as the 6 of Swords, in this case it is modified not only by the card next to it, Ace of Pentacles, but also by the card at the opposite end, Knave of Wands. If these cards are of a contrary element to the car d itself, they very much weaken and neutralize its force, but if the contrary element i s only in one card, and the other is of a connecting nature, it does not much matter. This is explained later among the tabulated rules. The King of Cups is between the 9 of Wands and the Wheel of Fortune, both of which cards are of a fiery nature, and therefore contrary to Cups w hich is Water, and therefore it shows that the Enquirer is rather lacking in perseverance and ener gy. 10 of Pentacles, “His business will begin to prosper,” 8 of Cups, “but yet he will lose inter est in it, owing to his love of pleasure and society” (shown by 8 of Cups having the suit on eac h side of it). Wheel of Fortune, “and through his fortune changing for the better.” Knave of Wand s (Knight of Wands on one side and 6 of Swords on the other), “He yet is anxious through fa lling in love with a graceful and sprightly girl with chestnut hair and fair complexion whom he has recently met: (shown by Knight of Wands turned contrary to the course of the reading). 10 o f Cups, “His suit is at first favourably received.” 5 of Swords, “but some slanderous report s and mischief making” (not altogether without foundation) “come to her knowledge.” Ace of Pentacles, “though his increasing prosperity in business.” 10 of Cups, “had lead her to regard him with favour.” The Diviner now pairs the cards from opposite ends of the horseshoe, as in the following example. Knave of Wands - 6 of Swords “She is anxious about this.” Knight of Wands - Ace of Pentacles “And he begins to neglect his business which yet is fairly good. 3 of Cups - 2 of Pentacles “And instead throws aside his business for pleasure s. Knight of Cups - 5 of Cups “The consequence of this is that the engagement bet ween them is broken off, shown by Knight being turned in opposite direction."},{"pageNumber":879,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 37 10 of Pentacles - 8 of Cups “Still his business does fairly well though he is l osing interest in it. 5 of Swords - 10 of Cups “The matter is the subject of much gossip. 9 of Wands - Queen of Cups These two cards of contrary suits are therefore of little importance. “Among their acquaintances.” King of Cups - Knave of Cups “He moreover begins to pay attention to another gir l of not quite so fair complexion.

This concludes the reading in the First Operation, which may be thus resumed: “The enquirer is a fair young man who works very ha rd, and has hitherto gained but little money, yet matters are beginning to improve. He is fond of society, and of visiting friends. He is rather lacking in perseverance and energy. Notwiths tanding this, his business and money transactions will begin to prosper. But yet he will lose interest in it owing to his love of pleasure and society, and though his fortune is changing for the better he has yet much anxiety through falling in love with a graceful and sprightly girl with chestnut hair and fair complexion whom he has recently met. His suit is at first favourably r eceived, but some slanderous tales and mischief- making not altogether without foundation, come to h er knowledge, though his increasing prosperity in business has led her to regard him wi th favour. She is made anxious by this, and he begins to neglect his business which yet is fairly good, and instead abandons it for pleasure and merry-making.” “The consequence of this is that the engagement is broken off. Still his business does fairly well though he has lost interest in it. The whole affair is the subject of much gossip among their mutual acquaintances. (One of the chief misch ief-makers is a fair middle-aged woman shown by the Queen of Cups.) He, however, soon begi ns to pay attention to another girl of not quite so fair a complexion. She, however, prefers a dark young man who is much admired generally by the fair sex, but he has already gaine d the affection of a young woman with dark brown hair and blue eyes.” SECOND OPERATION REPRESENTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MATTER The Enquirer again carefully shuffles the cards, an d places the Pack on the table face"},{"pageNumber":880,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 38 downwards, but he is not to cut them. The Diviner n ow takes the Pack and deals it round card by card in 12 Packets face downwards in rotation as in the following diagram: (Deal and read in order of Houses against the direc tion of the Sun.) So that the first packet answering to the Ascendant will consist of t he 1st, 13th, 25th, 3 7th, 49th, 6 1st, 73rd cards as shown, and so on. This Operation is under the presidency of the Court Cards, whose dominion in the Celestial Heavens falls immediately between that of the 4 Knaves and that of the Keys answering to the 12 Signs of the Zodiac. It represents the 12 Astrological Houses of Heaven, as shown. Without altering the relative order of the packets, or of the cards in the packets, the Diviner examines each in succession, till he finds the one which contains the Significator. This he retains for reading, noting carefully to which a strological house it corresponds and gathers up the other packets, and puts them aside, as they are not of any further use in this operation. As before, the Diviner reads the packet containing the Significator, by spreading them out in the form of a horseshoe, first reading by counti ng the cards in order from the Significator in the direction in which the face of the figure on th e card is turned, and next by pairing the cards together from the opposite ends of the horseshoe. I t is hardly likely that in so small a packet there will be either 3 or 4 cards of a sort, but if there be, the Diviner takes note of the same, and also observes which suit predominates. I now continue th e examples commenced in the previous operation. I must here observe that the example is purely of my own invention, and of course is not contained in the Book T, wherein only the mode of working is given. I have purposely taken a commonplace, trivial, and material question for e lucidation."},{"pageNumber":881,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 39 We will suppose the Enquirer to have duly and caref ully shuffled the Cards, thinking of his affairs, and that the Diviner has dealt them ro und into 12 packets as above shown. The packet containing the Significator is located in the Ascen dant, and it contains the following cards in the order given. This mode of reading shows that as the Significator is in the Ascendant it will principally relate to the Enquirer’s manner of living at this p oint. The Significator is in this case right side up, whe reas in the previous reading it was inverted and is looking towards the 9 of Swords, wh ich direction therefore the reading proceeds, counting thus: 4 from King of Cups - Knave of Penta cles; 7 from this - Sun; 9 from this; - Knave of Pentacles; 7 from this - Sun; where the reading ends. King of Cups - Knave of Pentacles “The enquirer is unhappy” (looking to 9 of Swords) “and makes the acquaintance of the girl with the dark hair and blue eyes with whom the dark young man (his rival) is in love. (She is artistic and well-mannered; and hopes to carry out her wishes, i.e. to marry the dark man with whom the fair girl, to whom the Enquirer has transf erred his affection, is now in love.)

The pack is not cut. The Diviner deals out the card s into 12 Packets in precisely the same manner as in the Second Operation. Only instead of being r eferred to the 12 Astrological Houses, these 12 Packets are under the presidency of the 12 Keys of the Tarot attributed to the 12 Signs of the Zodiac. The first packet, Emperor - Aries, the 2nd, Hierophant - Taurus, the 3rd, Lovers - Gemini, and so on. As before the Diviner selects th e packet which contains the Significator for reading, and rejects the rest. He notes also the me aning of the Trump answering to the Sign of the Zodiac, under which the Packet falls. He spread s the cards out in the form of a horseshoe, exactly as before.’ I now continue the example befo re commenced: EXAMPLE We will suppose that the Packet containing the King of Cups is that whose position answers to the Hierophant - Taurus and that it cons ists of the following cards, arranged as in the diagram.

The reading proceeds according to the usual order of counting, as follows: King of Cups, 2 of Wands. Magician - Queen of Wands; Universe - Tower; 2 of W ands again. It may be mentioned that supposing a packet to cons ist of six cards, and the Significator to be a Knave, or counting 7 from it, it would come back to the Knave again, this would show that the Enquirer would act according to his own id eas in this point of question, and would not let his line of action be influenced by the opinion of others.

Universe - Magician “The entire matter becomes invested with trickery a nd glamour.” Queen of Wands - King of Cups “As she herself pays him a good deal of attention a nd sympathy,” 2 of Pentacles “Which furthers her plans by bringing about a frien dship between them.” FOURTH OPERATION THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE QUESTION As before the Enquirer is instructed to shuffle the pack and place it on the table but not to cut it. The Diviner takes the Pack, turns it face upwards, and goes through it, being careful not to disarrange the order of the cards, till he finds the Significator. At this point he cuts the Pack, that is to say, he takes the Significator and the c ards which had been beneath it and places them on the top of the remainder, turning the whole face downwards again, ready for dealing out. (Be very careful here: S.A.) The consequence of this Operation is that the Signi ficator becomes the top card of the pack (bottom, really; face on table). The Diviner t akes off the Significator, places it face upwards on the middle of the table and then the following 3 6 cards laid out in the form of a circle round it, face upwards, answering to the 36 Decanates of the Zodiac, and showing the further development of the Question. These are dealt round in the order and direction of dealing as the 12 packets in the two previous operations. The reading proceeds by the same law of counting, b ut instead of counting from the Significator itself, it begins from the first card of the 36, and always goes in the direction of dealing. The suit which is in the majority and the circumstances of either 3 or 4 cards of a sort being found in the 36 Decanates are also noted. Whe n the reading by counting is finished the cards are paired together; 1st and 36th; 2nd and 35 th; 3rd and 34th; and so on, placed in order successively upon the Significator. I now continue the example before commenced."},{"pageNumber":884,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 42 We will suppose the Enquirer to have shuffled the p ack, and that the Diviner takes it in his hands, and in turning it up finds the bottom ca rd to be Temperance. On going through it he comes to the Significator, thus: He therefore takes the cards from King of Cups to T emperance included and places them above (or behind, S.A.) the 5 of Pentacles, being c areful not to disturb their relative order. This has really the effect of cutting the pack between t he Queen of Wands and the King of Cups. "},{"pageNumber":885,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 43 Of course when he again turns them face downwards f or dealing, the King of Cups will necessarily be the top card and the Queen of Wands the bottom card; Temperance being immediately above the 5 of Pentacles, the former to p card. The Diviner takes the top card, the Significator and places it face upwards in the cent re, and then deals round in succession 36 cards, face upwards in the order shown in the above Diagra m. Let us suppose them to be thus arranged. The readin g always proceeds in the same direction as the dealing in this form of operation, commencing the counting from the 1st card dealt. We here find 12 out of the 22 keys; 7 of Wands; 7 o f Cups; 5 of Swords; 6 of Pentacles; total 37 including Significator. The preponderance of the Keys represent “Influences beyond the control of the Enquirer.” There are four Kings - “M eetings with influential persons,” and four Eights, “Much news and correspondence.” The counting proceeds as follows from the first car d dealt. King of Cups - Six of Cups -5 of Pentacles - Hermit -4 of Cups - Fortitude -4 of Swords - 7 of Cups - Justice - 5 of Cups King of Swords - Emperor - 6 of Cups again. King of Cups - 6 of Cups “The Enquirer’s love of pleasure-going,” 5 of Pentacles “Brings about loss of money and business,” Hermit “And he is forced to be more prudent,’ 4 of Cups “And not go into the society of others so much, whi ch has already brought him anxiety (shown by 4 Cups between 2 Wands, contrary elements weakening effect on this card.)

Star - Fortitude “As he hopes this will have proved a lesson to him, King of Swords - King of Pentacles “And points out to him that his former rival, 3 of Wands - 8 of Pentacles “Though perhaps vain, was yet a hard-working and go od man of business. 4 of Cups - 10 of Swords “The Enquirer in consequence of this determines to completely give up his former mode of life which had brought him to the brink of ruin, and becomes a steady man. 8 of Wands - 6 of Wands “After this he suddenly receives a hasty message wh ich gives him much pleasure, 3 of Cups - 9 of Pentacles “Stating that owing to the loss of a relative he is the inheritor of a legacy.” This concludes the Fourth Operation. It is always necessary for the Diviner to employ hi s intuition in reading, and sometimes he may have to clairvoyantly “go through” a card of doubtful signification. Thus in the reading just given it is only the circumstance of the Moon, Chariot, 8 of Swords, Ace of Pentacles being followed by other confirmative cards which justifie s such an evil meaning of them."},{"pageNumber":887,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 45 FIFTH OPERATION CONCLUSION OF THE MATTER The cards are to be again carefully shuffled by the Enquirer but not cut. The Diviner then takes the Pack, and deals it card by card in rotati on into ten answering to the Tree of Life. This refers to the rule of the 10 Sephiroth in the Celes tial Heavens. This being done, the Diviner selects the packet con taining the Significator for reading, noting carefully under which Sephirah it falls, and taking this as a general indication in the matter. This packet is then spread out in a horsesh oe form, and read in the usual way, counting from the Significator and this time in the directio n in which the face of the figure looks. The cards are finally paired together as in the previou s Operation. This completes the Mode of Divination called “The Opening of the Key.”! now gi ve the conclusion of the example. We will suppose that the cards have been shuffled a nd dealt in the following manner into 10 packets answering to the Sephiroth in the Tree o f Life:"},{"pageNumber":888,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 46 The packet containing the Significator falls under Binah, containing the 3, 13, 23, 33,43, 53, 63, and 73rd cards dealt. This is an argument o f sadness and trial. The cards are spread as follows: The counting proceeds as follows: King of Cups - St ar - Judgment - King of Cups again. Evil cards are in the majority, another argument of loss and trouble. King of Cups - Star - Judgment “He has hopes of thus establishing his fortunes and that a favourable result will ensue for him.” The Diviner then pairs them thus: King of Cups - 7 of Pentacles “He plunges therefore into speculation by which he loses heavily (indicated by 7 Pentacles near Hanged Man.) Knave of Cups - Hanged Man “And his love affair comes to nothing.” Star - Judgment “All his expectations are disappointed,” Knight of Pentacles - 8 of Swords “And his life for a time is arduous, petty, and uni nteresting.” (The coming of trouble is here shown by the Knight of Pentacles looking against the direction of the reading. If it were turned the oth er way it would show that his troubles were quitting him and that matters would improve.) This completes the operation, and shows the general development and result of the question. TABULATED RULES SHUFFLING, CUTTING, DEALING AND EXAMINING In shuffling, the mind of the Enquirer should be ea rnestly fixed on the matter concerning which he desires information. If any cards fall in the process, they should be taken up"},{"pageNumber":889,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 47 without being noticed and the shuffling resumed. Th e shuffling being concluded, and the pack placed upon the table, if any cards fall to the gro und, or become turned in a different direction, the shuffling should be done again, in less importa nt matters. In more important matters see previous instructions. A cut should be clean and decided. If any cards fal l from the hand in the performance, the operation of shuffling should be repeated before th ey are again cut. In dealing, care should be taken not to invert the cards, and their relative o rder should be strictly maintained. In examining a pack of cards, their relative order should be rig idly maintained, as without care in this respect, one may be easily pushed under or over another, whi ch would of course have the effect of completely altering the counting in the Reading. THE SELECTION OF THE SIGNIFICATOR AND OF THE COMPLEXION ASSIGNED TO THE COURT CARDS Wands generally Fair and red-haired person Cups generally Moderately fair Swords generally Moderately dark Pentacles generally Very dark Kings Men Queens Women Knights Young men Princesses (Knaves) Young women Therefore the Significators are to be thus selected . For example, a dark complexioned middle-aged man, King of Pentacles. A fair young wo man, Princess (Knave) of Cups, etc. In the actual reading of the cards, these descripti ons can be modified by those which are on either side of them, thus: The Queen of Cups, wh ich indicates a fair woman with golden brown hair, if between cards of the suits of Swords and Pentacles, would show a woman with rather dark brownhair and dark eyes. As before stat ed, the Knights and Queens almost invariably represent actual men and women connected with the s ubject in hand. But the Kings sometimes represent either the coming on or going off of a ma tter, arrival, or departure, according to the way in which they face. While the Knaves show opini ons, thoughts, or ideas, either in harmony with or opposed to the subject.

"},{"pageNumber":894,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 52 THE SIGNIFICATION OF THE CARDS A card is strong or weak, well-dignified or ill-dig nified, according to the cards which are next to it on either side. Cards of the same suit o n either side strengthen it greatly either for good or evil, according to their nature. Cards of the su its answering to its contrary element, on either side, weaken it greatly for good or evil. Air and E arth are contraries as also are Fire and Water. Air is friendly with Water and Fire, and Fire with Air and Earth. If a card of the suit of Wands falls between a Cup and a Sword, the Sword modifies and connects the Wand with the Cup, so that it is not w eakened by its vicinity, but is modified by the influence of both cards; therefore fairly strong. B ut if a card pass between two which are naturally contrary, it is not affected by either mu ch, as a Wand between a Sword and a Pentacle which latter, being Air and Earth, are contrary and therefore weaken each other. Here the question being of the Wand, this card is n ot to be noticed as forming a link between the Sword and Pentacle. A FEW EXAMPLES By G.H. FRATER S.R.M.D. 9 SW. 10 SW. 5 SW. Very strong and potent in action. Very evil. 10 W. 10 SW. 2 W. Not quite so strong. Ruin checked and perhaps overc ome. 6 C. 10 SW. 10 C. Rather good than otherwise.

Moderately strong. Rashness which brings evil in it s train. Evil. 9P.2 W.6P. Fairly strong. Good. Considerable gain and victory. 10 C. 2 W. 6 C. Weak, evil. Victory which is perverted by debaucher y and evil living. But other cards may mitigate the judgment. 9 SW. 10 C. 5 SW. Medium strong. Evil. Sorrow arising from pleasure a nd through one’s own pleasures. 9 P. 10 C. 6 P. Perfect success and happiness."},{"pageNumber":895,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 53 10 W. 10 C. 5 Sw. Rather evil. Pleasure that when obtained is not wor th the trouble one has had in obtaining it. 10 SW. 6 C. 9 P. Fairly strong and good. The Sw. and P. being opposi te elements counteract each other.

PAIRING THE CARDS IN READING On pairing the cards each is to be taken as of equa l force with the other. If of opposite elements they mutually weaken each other. If at the end of the pairing of the cards in a packet, one card remains over, it signifies the partial res ult of that particular part of the Divination only. If an evil card and the other good, it would modify the good. If it be the Significator of the Enquirer, or of an other person, it would show that matters would much depend on the line of action taken by th e person represented. The reason of this importance of the single card is, that it is alone and not modified. If two cards are at the end instead of a single one, they are not of so much im portance. THE EXERCISE OF CLAIRVOYANCE AND INTUITION In describing any person from a Significator in the actual reading, the Diviner should endeavour, by Clairvoyance and using the card in qu estion as a symbol, to see the person implied using the rules to aid, and restrict, his vision. I n describing an event from the cards in the reading, he should employ his intuition in the same manner. Personal descriptions are modified by the cards next to them; e. g., the Knave of Wand s represents usually a very fair girl, but if between cards of the suit of Pentacles, she might b e even quite dark, though the Wands would still give a certain brightness to hair, eyes, and complexion."},{"pageNumber":896,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 54 COUNTING In all cases of counting from the card last touched , the card itself is 1, that next it is 2, and so on.

UNOFFICIAL DESCRIPTION OF THE TAROT TRUMPS By G. H. SOROR Q. L. The cards of the Le sser Arcana present to us the vi brations of Number, Colour and Element - that is, the plane on which nu mber and colour function. Thus, in the Ten of Pentacles we have the number Ten and tertiary colours, citrine, olive, and russet, working in Malkuth, the material plane. In the Ten of W ands we have the number Ten and the tertiaries working in pure e nergy. In these cards, the Sephirah is indicated by the colouring of the cloud s; the plane b y the colouring of the s ymbols. The four Honours of each suit taken in their most a bstract sense may be interpreted as: Poten tial Pow er is th e Kin g Brood ing Pow er is th e Qu een Pow er in action is the Kn igh t Recep tion an d Transmission is th e Kn ave. All these cards are coloured according to their ele ments plus the Sephirah to which they are attributed. With the Greater Arcana, however, we are given the Ke ys to divine manifestation, each one an individual for ce to be considered independently. It must never be forgotten that the Trumps are, intrinsicall y, gl yphs of cosmic not human forces."},{"pageNumber":897,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 55 TRUMPS 0. The Fool. This card as usually presented shows a man in motle y striding along heedless of the dog which tears his garments and threatens t o attack him. In this is seen only the lower aspect of the card, giving no hint to the Divine Folly of which St. Paul speaks. But in the Order pack, an effort is made to reveal the deeper meaning. A naked child stands beneath a rose-tree bearing yell ow roses - the golden Rose of Joy as well as the Rose of Silence. While reaching up t o the Roses, he yet holds in leash a grey wolf, worldly wisdom held in check by perfect innocence. The colours are pale yellow, pale blue, greenish yellow - suggestive of the early dawn of a spring day. 1. The Magician. It represents the union and balance of the elementa l powers controlled by mind. The Adept dedicating the minor implements on the Altar. The paths of Beth and Mercury link Kether the Crown with Binah, the A imah Elohim. The Magician, therefore, is reflected in the Intellect which stor es and gathers up knowledge and pours it into the House of Life, Binah. The number of the Path, 12, suggests the synthesis of the Zodiac, as Mercury is the synthesi s of the planets. The colours yellow, violet, grey and indigo, point to the myste rious astral light surrounding the great Adept. It is a card linked with the name Tahu ti and Hermes as the previous one is with Krishna and Harparkrat or Dionysius. 2. The High Priestess. She rules the long path uniting Kether to Tiphareth , crossing the reciprocal Paths of Venus and Leo. She is the great feminine f orce controlling the very source of life, gathering into herself all the energising for ces and holding them in solution until the time of release. Her colours, pale blue, deepen ing into sky blue, silvery white, and silver, relieved by touches of orange and flame , carry out these ideas. 3. The Empress. She is an aspect of Isis; the creative and positive side of Nature is suggested here. The Egyptian trilogy, Isis, Hathor and Nephth ys, symbolised by the crescent, full moon, and gibbous moon are represented in the Tarot by the High Priestess, Hathor. The Empress, Isis, takes either the crescen t moon or Venus as her symbol. Justice, Nephthys, takes the gibbous moon. Isis and Venus give the aspect of Love, while Hatho r is rather the Mystic, the full moon reflecting the Sun of Tiphareth while in Yesod, transmitting the rays of the Sun in her path Gimel. In interpreting a practical Tarot it is often admissable to regard the Empress as standing for Occultism. The H igh Priestess for religion, the Church as distinguished from the Order. The Empress, whose letter is Daleth, is the Door of the inner mysteries, as Venus is the door of the Vault. Her colours are eme rald, sky-blue, blue-green and cerise or rose-pink. 4. The Emperor. Here we have the great energising forces as indicat ed by the varying shades of red. It may be noted here that the red paths remain red in all planes, varying only in shade. Thus Aries,"},{"pageNumber":898,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 56 the Emperor, the Pioneer, the General, is blood and deep crimson, red, pure vermillion or glowing fiery red. He is Ho Nike the Conqueror, hot, passionate, impetuous, the apotheosis of Mars, whether in love or in war. He is the positive masculine as the Empress is the positive feminine. 5. Hierophant. The High Priest is the counterpart of the High Prie stess. As Aries is the house of Mars and the exaltation of the Sun, so Taurus is the house of Venus and exaltation of the Moon. He is the reflective or mys tical aspect of the masculine. He is the thinker as the Emperor is the doer. His colours unlike those of the Emperor vary consid erably. Red, orange, maroon, deep brown, and chestnut brown, suggest vei led thought, interior power, endurance, contemplation and reconciliation. This c ard frequently indicates the hidden guar, ianship of the Masters. 6. The Lovers. The impact of inspiration on intuition, resulting i n illumination and liberation - the sword striking off the fetters of habit and materialism, Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the Dragon of fear and the waters of Stagnation. (Consult the Golden Dawn Tarot Deck, Wang & Regardi e, U.S. Games S ystems.) The colours are orange, violet, purplish grey and p earl gre y. The flashing colour of orange gives deep vivid blue while the fl ashing colour for violet is golden yellow. The flashing colours may always be i ntroduced if they bring out the essent : . l colour meaning more clearly. In practise this card usually signifies sympathetic understanding. 7. The Chariot. Here we have a s ymbol of the spirit of man controll ing the lower principles, soul and body, and thus passing triumphantly throug h the astral plane, rising above the clouds of illusion and penetrating to the highe r spheres. The colours amber, silver-grey, blue-gre y, and the deep blue violet of the night sky elucidate this symbol. It is the sublimat ion of the Psyche. 8. Strength. This also represents the mastery of the lower by th e higher. But in this case it is the soul which holds in check the passions, alth ough her feet are still planted on earth, and the dark veil still floats about her hea d and clings around her. The colours, pale greenish yellow, black, yellowish gre y and reddish amber, suggest the steadfast endurance and fortitude required, but the deep red rose which is the flashing colour to the greenish yellow, gives the m otive power. 9. The Hermit. Prudence. These three trumps should be collated in studying them for the y represent the three stages of initiation. The man w rapped in hood and mantle, and carrying a lantern to illuminate the Path and a sta ff to support his footsteps. He is the eternal seeker, the Pilgrim soul. His hood and mant le are the brown of earth, and above him is the night-sky. But the delicate yellow -greens and bluish greens of spring are about him, and spring is in his heart."},{"pageNumber":899,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 57 10. Wh eel of Fortu n e. In the Tree of Life, the W heel is placed on the P il lar of Merc y, where it forms the principal column linking Netz ach to Chese d, Victory to Mercy. It is the revolution of experience and progress, the steps of the Zodiac, the revolving staircase, held in place by the counter-changing influence of Light and Darkness, Time and Eternity - presided over by the P lutonian c ynocepha lus below, and the Sphinx of Egypt above, the eternal Riddle which can only be s olved when we attain liberation. The basic colours of this Trump are blu e, violet, deep purple, and blue irradiated b y yellow. But the zodiacal spokes of th e wheel should be in the colours of the spectrum, while the Ape is in those of Malku th, and the Sphinx in the primary colours and black. 11. Ju stice. Nephthys, the third aspect of Luna, the twin sister of Isis. Justice as distinguished from love. Her emblems are the Sword and the Scales. Like her sister, she is clothed in green, but in a sharper colder gr een than the pure emerald of Isis. Her subsidiary colours are blue, blue-green, pale g reen. It is only by utilising the flashing colours that we can find the hidden warmth and steadfastness. 12. Th e Hanged Man. An elusive, because a profoundly significant symbol . It is sacrifice - the submergence of the higher in the lower in order to sublimate the lower. It is the descent of the Spirit into Matter, the incarnation of God in man, the submission to the bonds of matter that the material may be transc ended and transmuted. The colours are deep blue, white and black intermingled but not merged, olive, green and greenish fawn. 13. Death . The sign of transmutation and disintegration. The s keleton which alone survives the destructive power of time, may be rega rded as the foundation upon which the structure is built. The type which persis ts through the permutations of Time and Space, adaptable to the requirements of ev olution and yet radically unchanged. It is the transmuting power of Nature wo rking from below upwards, as the Hanged Man is the transmuting power of the spir it working from above downwards. The colours are blue-green, both dark an d pale, the two dominant colours of the visible world, and the flashing colo urs of orange and red-orange. 14. Temp eran ce. This is the equilibrium not of the balance of Libra but of the impetus of the Arrow, Sagittarius, which cleaves its way through t he air by the force imparted to it by the taut string of the Bow.

This card should be studied in conjunction with No. 13. The y are the two great controlling forces of the Universe, the centrifugal and the centripetal, destructive and reproductive, dynamic and static. The lower nature of man fears and hates the transmuting process; hence the chains binding the l esser figures and the bestial forms of their lower limbs. Yet this very fear of change and disintegration is necessary to stabilise the life-force and preserve continuit y. The colours are indigo, livid brown, golden brown and gre y. 16. .. Th e Tow er. As always red remains persistent throughout the fou r planes, although modified in tone. Thus we find vivid scarlet shading into deep sombre red and vermillion shot with amber. The contrasting shades of green serve to thr ow the red into relief. The tremendous destructive influence of the lightning, rending asunder established forms to make way for new forms to emerge. It is revolution as distinguished from transmutation or sublimation. Destructive as opposed to the conse rvative, energy attacking inertia. The impetuous ejection of those who would enclose t hemselves in the walls of ease and tradition. 17. Th e S tar. This shows the seven-pointed Star of Venus shining above the Waters of Aquarius, the guiding force of love in all its form s and aspects, illuminates the soul during her immersion in Humanity. Thus bonds of Sat urn are dissolved in the purified Waters of Baptism. The dove of the S pirit hovers ab ove the Tree of Knowledge giving the promise of ultimate attainment - and on the oth er side gleams of the Tree of Life. Pale colours suggest dawn and the morning Star - am ethyst, pale grey, fawn, dove colour and white, with the pale yellow of the Star. 18. .. Th e Moon . Here also is a river but it is the troubled waters of Night, wherein is to be descried a crayfish, counterpart of the Scarabeus. From the water's edge winds the dark path of toil, effort and possible failure. It is gu arded b y the threatening watch-dogs, seeking to intimidate the wayfar ers, while in the d istance the barren hills are surmounted b y the frowning fortresses still further guarding the way to attainment. It is the path of blood and tears in which fear, weakness , and fluctuation must be overcome. The colours are dark crimson, reddish brown, browni sh crimson and plum colours - but their sombre hues are lightened b y the translucent faint greens and yellows to be found in their counterparts. 19.

The c olours are clear-orange, golden-yellow, amber shot with red, and the contras ting blue and purple. 20. Th e Last Jud gmen t. The three trumps attributed to the Elemental P aths are perhaps the most difficult to understand. They represent the action of forces exterior to the experience of humanity, not the influence of environment but t he impact of the S upernals upon the sublunary. In the Air we have pure spirit holding in leash the lust of the flesh. In water, the sublimating power of sacrifice. Here in Fire, w e are shown the cosmic forces concentrating on the pilgrim from all sides. Judgme nt is pronounced upon him. He is not the judge nor does decision rest in his hands. Lazarus cannot emerge from the Sepulchre until the voice cries out, \"Come forth!\" Nor can he cast aside the conflicting grave-clothes until the command, \"Loose him!\" is given. Man of himself is helpless. The impulse to ascend must come from a bove, but by its power he may transcend the sepulchre of environment and cast asi de the trammels of desire. Here once more, the fiery energy of red burns through th e planes. Fiery scarlet, glowing crimson, burning red are emphasiz ed by pa ssive gree ns. 21. Th e Universe. Observe that this represents not the World but the Universe. It should be remembered that to the ancients, S aturn represented the confines of the S olar s ystem. They had no means of measuring either Uranu s or Neptune. To them, therefore, Saturn passing through the spiral path o f the Zodiac, marked at its cardinal points by the symbols of the Kerubim forming the Cr oss, was a comprehensive gl yph of the whole. Thus, in this card we find a synthesis of the whole Taro or Rota. The central figure should be taken as Hathor, Athor, or Ator, r ather than Isis, thus indicating the hidden anagram which ma y perhaps be translated thus : ORAT - man pra ys. ATOR - to the Great Mother, TARO - who turns, ROTA - the w heel of Life and Death. The colours like those of the Wheel of Fortune incl ude the colours of the Spectrum and those of the elements, but they are pl aced against the indigo and black of Saturn, with the white gleam of the Stars shinin g in the darkness and the misty figure of the Aimah Elohim in the midst. In the pra ctical Tarot, this card is taken to signify the matter in hand, that is the subject of an y question that has been asked. Having now reviewed the 22 Atous or Trumps in succe ssion, it will be wise for the Student to reverse the process and seek to foll ow the Path of the Pilgrim from below upwards, thus seeking to comprehend the inter ior process of Initiation and Illumination. It is a process in which the whole Un iverse does not disdain to take part, for Man is himself the Microcosm of the Macrocosm a nd the Child of the Gods. And again, the Macrocosm must itself be undergoing a co rresponding process in which the experience not only of humanity but of each ind ividual must be an integral part. The fragments are gathered up into the baskets, tha t nothing may be lost; and from the feeding of the multitude there remains not less but more than the unbroken bread and fish - fit emblems of Earth and W ater.

It represents the Heavens polarized on the plane of the Ecliptic, not on the plane of the Equa tor of our Earth, so that its North Pole is the veritable North Pole of our Heavens and not merely that part of them to which the North Pole of our Earth now points. Another very important difference is that, througho ut the true Tarot, the teaching assigns the commencing Point of the Zodiac to the bright St ar “Regulus” which is in Leo. And it measures Right Ascension and Longitude from that po int, and not from a suppositious point divided by the Equinox and called the 0° of Aries ( though in reality now far removed from the constellation of that name), which has been adopted by modern or western astronomy and astrology. By this now usual way of reckoning, and the Process ion of the Equinoxes, it has gradually come to pass that the signs (or divisions , each of 30°, of the Zodiac) no longer coincide with the constellations of the same name, and each decade shows them slowly but surely receding. But the Tarot method of reckoning from the star nam ed Regulus has, it will be seen, the effect of making the Signs and the Constellations c oincide. “Regulus” is also named Cor Leonis - “The Heart of the Lion.” “Regulus” means “Star of the Prince.” “Regulus” coi ncides with the position of the “heart” in the figure of Leo upon the Star Maps."},{"pageNumber":903,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 61 THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE "},{"pageNumber":904,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 62 THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE"},{"pageNumber":905,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 63 TABULAR VIEW OF THE DOMINION OF THE SYMBOLS OF THE TAROT IN THE CELESTIAL HEAVENS.

While the greater number of the Northern Constellat ions are connected with classical mythology, the titles of many of the Southern Const ellations, and especially of those near the South Pole, are of more or less recent nomenclature , and bear witness to absence of reference to Occult Knowledge, such names for instance as Reticu lum, and Coelum Scuiptores, Octanus, etc. RECAPITULATION In the dominion of the various forces, the rule of each may be divided into three portions. The centre is the most pronounced in its accord wit h the nature of its Ruler, and the two outer portions are tinged with the nature of the Ruler of the dominion bordering thereon. For example, in the case of Leo, the Dominion of Fortitude, the central 10 degrees will have most of this nature. For the beginning 10 degrees are tinged wit h the nature of Cancer, and the last ten degrees with the nature of Virgo, the nature of Leo however predominating the mixture. The whole Heavens then, are thus divided into Four Great Belts or Zones: The Uppermost Is the Dominion of the Knaves like a Cross within a Circle. The Second Belt Under the Dominion of the other Court cards represe nts a Belt of Influence descending vertically. The Third Belt Is under the Dominion of the 12 Keys related to the Signs of the Zodiac, represents a Belt of influence acting horizontally. This Zone in unio n with the second Belt will therefore yield a great Zone of 12 Crosses encircling the heavens. The Fourth Belt Consists of 36 Decans under the Dominion of the 36 small cards of the four suits, the numbers 2-10 of each suit. In each of these sets of 3 parts of a Sign, the central one will be more pronounced in effect than the lateral parts."},{"pageNumber":913,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 71 Therefore the 3 Decanates of each of the Signs will be symbolised by a triangle.

As we have before sufficiently learned the Ten Seph iroth are repeated not alone in each whole figure, but also in the parts thereof, so tha t every material thing created, will have its own Sephiroth and Paths. Now as the North Pole corresponds with Kether, and the South Pole corresponds with Malkuth, the central Pillar of the Sephirotic Tree will form the invisible Axis of the Sphere, the Central point coinciding with Tiphareth. This latte r Sephirah together with that of Yesod will be completely hidden from view, so that Tiphareth will be the exact centre of the Sphere.

Head, First convolution is the Ace of Cups. Second convolution is the Ace of Swords. Third convolution is the Ace of Pentacles. Fourth convolution is the Ace of Wands. This convoluted course will represent the Law of th e Aces. Now in the Four Faces of YHVH, Fire and Water be co ntrary, and also Earth and Air be contrary. The throne of the Element will attract an d seize, as it were, the Force of that element, so that herein be the Forces of Antipathy and of Sy mpathy, or what are known chemically as attraction and repulsion.

Gemini, Libra, Aquarius is Air, Swords of the Tarot . Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn is Earth, Pentacles of the Tarot.

FRATER S.R.M.D. It is here advisable to transcribe the following fr om Cornelius Agrippa: Of The Four Elements and Their Natural Qualities: “It is necessary that we should know and understand the nature and quality of the Four Elements, in order to our being perfect in the prin ciples and groundwork of our studies in the Talismanic or Magical Art. “Therefore, there are four Elements, the original g rounds of all corporeal things, viz.: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, of which elements all inferior bodies are compounded, not by way of being heaped up together, but by transmutati on and union; and when they are destroyed, they are resolved into elements. “But there are none of the sensible elements that a re pure. They are more or less mixed, and apt to be changed into one into the other, even as earth being moistened and dissolved becomes water, but the same being made thick and ha rd becomes earth again, and being evaporated through heat it passes into air, and tha t being kindled into fire; and this being extinguished into air again; but being cooled after burning becomes water again, or else stone or sulphur, and this is clearly demonstrated by lightn ing. “Now every one of these Elements has two specific q ualities: the former whereof it retains as proper to itself; in the other as a mean , it agrees with that which comes directly after it . For Fire is hot and dry; Water cold and moist; and Air hot and moist; and so in this manner, the Elements, according to two contrary qualities are o pposite one to the other, as Fire to Water, and Earth to Air. “Likewise the Elements are contrary one to the othe r on another account. Two are heavy, as Earth and Water; and the others are light, as Fi re and Air. TABLE SHOWING QUALITIES OF ELEMENTS Fire Heat, dryness, excessive lightness, brilliance, exc essive subtlety, motion rapid. Water Cold, moisture, weight, obscurity, solidity, motion . Air Heat, moisture, lightness, slight obscurity, subtle ty, excessive motion. Earth Cold, dryness, excessive weight, excessive obscurit y, excessive solidity, rest."},{"pageNumber":922,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 80 TABLE SHOWING THE QUALITIES OF THE ELEMENTS WHEN MI XED IN PAIRS Fire and Water. Slight weight, some subtlety, intense and rapid mot ion. Fire and Air. Great heat, intense lightness, slight brilliance, i ntense subtlety, intense motion. Fire and Earth. Great dryness, slight obscurity. Water and Air. Great moisture, intense motion. Water and Earth. Great cold, intense weight, intense obscurity, inte nse solidity. Air and Earth. Some weight, intense obscurity, little solidity, li ttle motion. Therefore the Stoics called the former ‘passives,’ but the latter ‘actives.’ And Plato distinguishes them after another manner, and assign s to each of them three qualities, viz.: To the Fire brightness, thinness and motion. To the Earth, darkness, thickness, and quietness. And according to these qualities the Ele ments of Fire and Earth are contrary. Now the other Elements borrow their qualities from these, s o that the Air receives two qualities from the Fire, thinness and motion, and from the Earth one, darkness. In like manner, Water receives two qualities from the Earth, darkness and thickness; a nd from the Fire one, motion. But Fire is twice as thin as Air, thrice more moveable, and four time s lighter. The Air is twice more bright, thrice more thin, and four times more moveable than Water. Therefore, as Fire is to Air, so is Air to Water, and Water to Earth. And again, as the Earth is to the Water, so is Water to Air, and Air to Fire. And this is the root and foundation of all bo dies, natures, and wonderful works. And he who can know and thoroughly understand these qualit ies of the Elements and their mixtures shall bring to pass wonderful and astonishing things in M agic. “Now each of these Elements has a threefold conside ration, so that the number of four may make up the number of twelve; and by passing by the number of seven into ten, there may be a progress to the Supreme Unity upon which all v irtue and wonderful things do depend. Of the first Order, are the pure Elements, which are n either compounded, changed, nor mixed, but are incorruptible and not of which but through whic h the virtues of all natural things are brought forth to act. No man is fully able to declare their Virtues, because they can do all things upon all things. He who remains ignorant of these, shall nev er be able to bring to pass any wonderful matter. “Of the second order are Elements that are compound ed, changeable and impure, yet such as may, by art, be reduced to their pure simpl icity, whose virtue, when they are thus reduced, doth above all things perfect all occult a nd common operations of Nature; and these are the foundations of the whole of natural Magic."},{"pageNumber":923,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 81 “Of the third Order are those elements which origin ally and of themselves are not elements, but are twice compounded, various, and ch angeable unto another. These are the infallible medium, and are called the Middle Nature , or Soul of the Middle Nature; very few there are that understand the deep mysteries thereo f. In them is, by means of certain numbers, degrees and orders, the perfection of every effect in what thing soever, whether natural, celestial, or super-celestial. They are full of wonders and my steries, and are operative in Magic, natural or divine. For, from these, through them, proceeds the binding, loosing, and transmutation of all things - the knowledge and foretelling of things to come, also the expelling of evil and the gaining of Good Spirits. Let no one, therefore, wit hout these three sorts of Elements, and the true knowledge thereof, be confident that he can work an ything in the occult science of Magic and Nature. “But whosoever shall know how to reduce those of on e order into another, impure into pure, compounded into simple, and shall understand distinctly the nature, virtue, and power of them, into number, degrees and order, without divid ing the substance, he shall easily attain to the knowledge and perfect operation of all natural thin gs, and celestial secrets likewise; and this is the perfection of the Qabalah, which teaches all th ese before mentioned; and by a perfect knowledge thereof, we perform many rare and wonderf ul experiments. In the original and exemplary world all things are all in all. So also in this corporeal world. And the elements are not only in these inferior things; but are in the Heave ns, in stars, in devils, in angels, and likewise in God Himself, the maker and original example of all things. “Now it must be understood that in these inferior b odies the elements are gross and corruptible, but in the heavens they are, with thei r natures and virtues, after a celestial and more excellent manner than in sublunary things. For the firmness of the celestial earth is there without the grossness of water, and the agility of Air with out exceeding its bounds. The heat of fire without burning, only shining, giving light and lif e to all things by its celestial heat.” Now the successive effect of the passage of the Ace s over the Stations above the place of a sign in the excitement of the Forces of that Sign may be readily calculated by the tables of the qualities of the elements simple and mixed, always being careful to take also into account the effect of the Throne upon the Season as well, and t he nature of the Sign. It is said that Kether is in Malkuth, and again, th at Malkuth is in Kether but after another manner. For downwards through the Four Worlds the Malkuth o f the less material will be linked unto the Kether of the more material. From the Synt hesis of the Ten corruscations of the AOUR (Light) proceedeth the influence unto EHEIEH, the K ether of Atziluth. And the connecting thread of the AIN SOPH is extended through the worl ds of the Ten Sephiroth and is in every direction. As the Ten Sephiroth operate in each Sep hirah, so will there be a KETHER in every MALKUTH, and MALKUTH in every KETHER. Thus:"},{"pageNumber":924,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 82 Adonai Melekh This will be the Malkuth of Atziluth. Metatron This will be the Kether of Briah. Sandalphon - Metraton - Nephesch ha-Messiah These will be the Malkuth of Briah. Chaioth ha-Qadesh This will be the Kether of Yetzirah. Aschim This will be the Malkuth of Yetzirah. Rashith ha-Gilgalim The Kether of Assiah. Cholem Yesodoth The Malkuth of Assiah. Thaumiel The Kether of the Qlippoth. The symbol of the connection between MALKUTH of YET ZIRAH and KETHER of ASSIAH will be of a form somewhat resembling that o f an hour glass. The thread of the AIN SOPH before alluded to, traversing the centre there of, and forming the AIN SOPH connection between the Worlds: So that the symbol of the connection between the tw o planes is this. And also the modus operandi of the translation of force from one plane into another is in this, and hence doth the title of the Sphere of Kether of Assiah signify the comme ncement of a whirling motion. Now also, in the diagram of Minutum Mundum, there b e four colours attributed unto Malkuth. Citrine, russet, olive, and black. And if we consider them as in a vertical sphere, we shall find citrine uppermost and horizontal, russet and olive midmost and vertical, black lowermost and horizontal. And again, these four represent in a manner the ope ration of the four elements in Malkuth; for example:"},{"pageNumber":925,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 83 Citrine Air of Earth. Russet Fire of Earth. Olive Water of Earth. Black Earth of Earth. From the diagram of the hour glass symbol it will b e manifest then that MALKUTH of YETZIRAH will be the transmitter of the Yetziratic forces unto KETHER of ASSIAH, and that the latter will be the recipient thereof, and that the Hour-glass symbol or double cone, will be the translator from the one plane unto the other. Here, therefore, let us consider the Yetziratic nomenclature of the Tenth Path answering unto Malku th, and of the First Path answering unto Kether. The Tenth Path: It is called the Resplendent Intell igence and it is so-called because it is exalted above every head, and sitteth on the Throne of Binah, and it illuminateth the splendour of all the Lights, and it causeth the current of Influ ence to flow from the Knight of Countenances, i.e. Metatron. The First Path: It is called the Wonderful or Hidde n Intelligence (The Highest Crown) for it is the Light to cause to understand the Primordi al without commencement, and it is the Primal Glory, for nothing created is worthy to follow out its essence. Whence it is plain that MALKUTH is, as it were, the collector together and synthesis of all the forces in its plane or world. While KETHER being superior unto all else in its plane or world, will be the recipient and arranger of the fo rces from the plane beyond, so as to distribute them unto its subordinate Sephiroth in a duly order ed manner. And therefore any force of the multitudinous and in numerable forces in Malkuth may act through the upper cone of the hour glass symbol, an d by means of the lower one translate its operation into KETHER below, but its mode of transm ission will be through the cones by the thread of the Am Soph, or of the Unformulated. So that in the transmission of force between two wo rlds the Formulate must first become Unformulate, ere it can reformulate in new conditio ns. For it must be plain that a force formulated in one world, if translated into another will be unformulated, according to the laws of a plane different in nature. Even as water in its f luid state will be subject to different laws to those governing it when in the conditions of either ice or steam. And as before said, there being in the Minutum Mund um diagram four chief elemental divisions of the Sephira MALKUTH, each of these wil l have its correlative formula of transmission unto the succeeding Kether. Hence also in the Order Tarot teaching is there the Dominion of the four Knaves of the Tarot pack aroun d the North Pole. Why then is it that it is the Four Knaves answering unto the final Heh of YHV H, that are here placed, rather than the Four Kings, Queens or Knights, or one of each natur e?"},{"pageNumber":926,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 84 We are taught that these are the Vice Regents of th e Name in the Four Worlds, and that they are thus attributed among the Sephiroth. Yod Chokmah and King. Heh Binah and Queen. Vau Tiphareth and Knight. Heh (final) Malkuth and Knave. Now as Kether of Assiah is to receive from Malkuth of Yetzirah, it is necessary that in and about Kether there should be a force which part aketh of the nature of Malkuth, though more subtle and refined in nature. And therefore is it t hat the final Heh, or Knave force, has its dominion placed about Kether. They are so placed th at they may attract from the Malkuth of the Higher and form the basis of action for the Aces. S o that a refined matter may attract its like, and the spiritual forces may not lose themselves in the void, to produce but a mistaken and whirling destruction for want of a settled basis. And herein is the mutual formula in all things, of a spirit and of a body, seeing that each supplies unto each that wherein the other is lacking, yet herein also must there be a certain condition, otherwise t he harmony will not be perfect. For unless the body be refined in nature, it will hinder the actio n of a spirit cognate unto it. And unless the spiri t be willing to ally itself unto the body, the latter will be injured thereby and each will mutually react on the other. Hourglass Connection of Malkuth and Kether."},{"pageNumber":927,"pageContent":"VOLUME NINE 85 Therefore, also, let the Adeptus Minor understand t hat there may be fault of the spirit as well as of the body, and that there is little diffe rence between the material and sensuous person, and the envious, malicious and self-righteous perso n - save that from their being more subtle and less evident, the sins of the latter are more insid ious than those of the former, though both are alike evil. But it is as necessary to govern the Sp irit as to refine the body, and of what use is it t o weaken the body by abstinence, if at the same time uncharitableness and spiritual pride are encouraged! It is simply translating one sin into a nother. And therefore are the final Heh forces so necessary in Kether, as it is said in the Tenth Path of the Sepher Yetzirah: “It is so called becau se it is exalted above every head, and sitteth on the Throne of Binah.” Now, in the Tree, the two Sep hiroth, Chokmah and Binah, are referred unto the Briatic World which is also called the Thr one or vehicle, that is of the Atzilutic World unto which latter Kether is referred on the Tree. A nd referring unto the dominions of the Four Knaves, thou shalt find that in the sphere they inc lude Chokmah and Binah as well as Kether. Now there will be, not one, but four formulae of th e application of the Four Forces of Malkuth, unto the revolution of the Aces in Kether, and these acting not singly but simultaneously and with a different degree of force . Were Malkuth or Kether in the same plane or world t he transmission of these forces from the one unto the other would proceed more or less i n direct lines. In this case, seeing that Malkuth and Kether be in different planes or worlds , the lines of transmission of these forces are caught up and whirled about by the upper cone of th e hour glass symbol into the vortex wherethrough passeth the thread of the unformulated , i.e. the Am Soph. Thence they are projected in a whirling convolution (yet according unto their nature) through the lower cone of the hour glass symbol unto Kether. Whence it resulteth that these formulae are of the nature of the Dragon, that is to say, moving in convolutions, and hence they are called t he Dragon or Serpent Formulae. Now imagining MALKUTH of Yetzirah to be in a vertic al position above KETHER of Assiah, it will be plain that the whole of the blac k part of Malkuth will be towards Kether, but only a portion of the russet and olive parts, and t hat the citrine parts will be entirely removed and on the further side. Wherefore the natural operatio n of these four forces towards Kether will be: black, rather horizontal than vertical, and acting fully. Citrine rather horizontal than vertical but acting at the edge of the circumference of Kether, and slightly rather than strongly. Russet a nd olive rather vertical than horizontal, and acting moderately. Now these four formulae will imply four simultaneou s movements in the revolution of the forces symbolised by the four Aces round the No rthern Pole. The first and most forcible in its immediate action will be that answering unto the Earth of Malkuth of Yetzirah, transmitting unto Kether of Assiah, and following the convolutions of the Constellation Draco. It is called the Direct or Creeping Formula and"},{"pageNumber":928,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 86 for this reason the Dragon may be wingless and foot ed as regards its symbolic representation. This formula has been throughly exp lained in the beginning of this section on the revolution of the Aces. In the expressions Earth of Malkuth, etc., it should be remembered that these do not imply pure but mixed elemental natures , seeing that Malkuth receiveth the ultimate effect of all the forces in the Tree of Life, even as the colours which be attributed thereto be not primaries, but tertiaries. Therefore each element i n Malkuth will be counter-changed with others, even as the Kerubim in the Vision of Ezekiel have e ach, not one but four heads and counterchanged. The second and least forcible in its immediate acti on will be the Dragon formula answering unto the Air of Malkuth of Yetzirah, tran smitting unto Kether of Assiah, and following the convolutions of four serpents upon th e four triplicities of the elements in the Zodiac or more properly speaking, upon the stations in the Dominions of the Knaves above them. Now also the Throne in each Dominion is marked in t he Book T as embracing more than a third of each dominion, because of the enduring e ffect of its force.

This formula of operation will be readily understood on reference to the diagram thereof, but more especially from the four diagrams showing the change of order and course of the aces. In this formula the heads of the four ser pents will be above the four cardinal signs. The Third Dragon Formula, moderately forcible in it s immediate action, is that answering unto the Fire of Malkuth of Yetzirah, transmitting unto Kether of Assiah, and following the law of the attraction and repulsion of the elements of the triplicities of the Zodiac. This is also called the Leaping or Darting Formula, and its serpents ma y be represented both footed and winged - footed to represent the attraction of the elements, winged to represent the repulsion by the contrary elements. This formula is more vertical in action, while the preceding two are more horizontal as before shown. This formula will be readily understood from the fo ur diagrams thereof and also from those showing the change of order in the course of the Aces. As before the heads of the serpents rest upon the Stations above the Cardinal Signs. The explanation of the course of one of the four se rpents will be sufficient to explain the whole.

This formula will b e more vertical in action, and can be readily understood from the diagram thereof, and from those showing the change of order in the course of the Aces. This formula may be best symbolically represented b y the four Aces revolving as in a smaller wheel upon a great circle whose body is com posed of the powers of the twelve Signs, so that this latter in its turn revolves upon the stat ions above the Zodiac. The effect of the revolution of the Wheel of the Aces will be to excite by the A ce of Wands the Fiery Signs, by the Ace of Cups the Watery Signs, by the Ace of Swords the Air y Signs, and by the Ace of Pentacles the Earthy Signs. Yet through the forces of the revolut ion of the Serpent as well, the forces of the Aces will be in their turn modified by the zodiacal natures in the body of the Serpent. And as before said the action of these formulae wil l be simultaneous though differing in degree, and of them all that first explained which followeth the convolutions of the Constellation Draco is the strongest in operation.

The Order's interest in Enochian became semi-public in 1912, when Aleister Crowley issued a two-part precis of its material in the sev enth and eighth numbers of The Equinox. As an historical document Crowley's account was badly flawed: in the first place by his lumping together the materials pertain ing to the Order with those pertaining to his personal research; and in the sec ond place by his trick of supplying verbose commentaries to everything that is obvious, while passing over the real obscurities as though they were self-evident.

Consequently it was not until 1940, when Is rael Regardie published the fourth volume of the Golden Dawn, that a clear and accurate record of the Order's Enochian teachings and magical techniques became av ailable to the public. It should be noted in passing that Regardie paid a heavy price for his candour and his labours. His book was greeted with an outpo uring of negative criticism, and a frenz y of chattered personal derision, which in their inarticulate fury were quite exceptional even for a milieu so full of touc h y egos as the Anglo-American world of the occult. Viewed in retrospect these \"bo ok reviews\" are often masterpieces of unintended comed y. Most of them, in deed, give the impression that they were written while their authors were frothing at the mouth and pawing the air with their left hands. But for a dedicated and sens itive yo ung author - and Regardie was scarcely thirt y when he be gan to publi sh the Golden Dawn - it must have been extremely painful to be the target of suc h unremitting vilification. The gravamen of all this abuse was that Regardie ha d broken the oaths of secrec y b y which he had bound himself as an Adept i n the Hermes Temple. Regardie's defence - which was actually printed two years before he began to make the Order material public - rested on three claims: first, that the Temple had itself so far degenerated that its Hierophants could no lo nger initiate effectively; second, that as a further consequence the teaching had beco me so distorted that there was clear and present danger or its being lost altogthe r; and, third, that while vows of occult secrec y are ce rtainl y meant to protect the n ames of the members and the whereabouts of the organization, they do not in pri nciple extend to the substance of the teaching itself 2 , which is implicitly addressed to whom it may conc ern. Toda y, after the passage of some fort y years, it is abunda ntl y clear the Regardie was entirely right and his detractors entirely wrong. T he central position that the Golden Dawn material occupies in modern esoteric studies a nd its far-reaching influence across organizational lines are due, not at all to the wisdom of its titular guardians, but simply and solely to Regardie's act of preserva tion. Of this fact the Enochian teachings, with which alone we are here concerned, are quite possibly the best case in point. These, in the Temple to which Regardie be longed, were almost completely ignored. Today they are so far from being ignored t hat two Enochian dictionaries are currently in print, a third is on the way, and in both the United S tates and England there are several groups which (with var yin g results) are endeavouring to conduct serious research into both the language and the magic. ENOCHIAN S OURCES The Enochian system originated through the ceremoni al skrying of Dr. J ohn Dee and Edward Kelley, whose sittings took place ov er a period of seven years beginning in 1582, when Dee was 54 years old and Ke lley 27. Dee was a polyhistor, and his erudition was like an imperial tureen - wid e and deep and almost unbelieveably capacious. By the standards of his da y he had valid claims to expert knowledge of mathematics, languages, geograph y, ast ronomy, mechanics, architecture, navigation, theology, cr yptology, poe tr y, painting,"},{"pageNumber":938,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 3 drama, optics, music, philosophy, genealogy, medici ne - and the Hermetic sciences. With the possible exception of Roger Baco n in the thirteenth century, Dee came nearer than any other Englishman to embracing all the knowledge of his age. His library, which by 1583 contained about 2500 boo ks and 170 manuscripts, was the largest in England and a rival to almost all the pr ivate Continental collections. His physical appearance was striking, This is Aubrey's description: \"Hee had a very faire cleare rosie complexion; a long beard as white as m ilke; he was tall and slender; a ver y handsome man.\" 3 Less is known of Kelley, for he was not a public fi gure, and much of what was written about him is not well documented. The p ortrait that emerges from the record of his sittings with Dee is of a highly ambi guous personality, war y and mistrustful, unstable and picric, prone on the one hand to terrifying fits of anger accompanied by physical violence, and on the other hand to sudden spiritual conversions from which he promptly relapsed. Before attaching himself to Dee's household, Kelley had served as secretary to the ma thematician and Hermetic scholar Thomas Allen, from whom he may have acquire d his knowledge of occult philosophy. He possessed a number of old books, son ..e pertaining to alchemy (in which he was passionately interested), but most of them apparently having to do with the recovery of buried treasure through the he lp of evil spirits. If Dee's mind was the tureen, Kelley's was the soup plate - somew hat shallow, but wide enough to hold a little bit of almost anything. Certainl y he was intelligent and not uneducated; he had been an undergraduate at Oxford under the (false) name of Edward Talbot, though it appears he was sent down a fter some sort of trouble. A few years later he was pilloried at Lancaster for forge ry. No evidence has survived bearing on his guilt or innocence, but it should be borne in mind that in Elizabethan England the administration of justice - at least wh ere the poor and the unpopular were concerned - was no less rough and read y than t he American Wild W est. Kelley presented himself at Dee's house in Mortlake on Thursday, 8 March 1582, and offered his services as a skryer. Two da y s later Dee was giving him a trial. Their preparations were of the simplest, con sisting merely of setting up the shewstone or crystal on the table of practice and o f a short praye r spoken b y the Doctor. The result was that Kelle y received, on tha t first da y, a vision of the angel Uriel, who revealed his secret signature and issued preliminary directions for the construction of two magical talismans: (1) the Sigi llum Dei Aemeth, a pentacle nine inches in diameter, to be made of purified wax; and (2) the Tabula Sancta, a table to be made of sweet wood two cubits high and two cubit s square, on which a large rectangular seal containing twelve Enochian letters was to be surrounded with seven circular seals attributed to the planetary po wers. The two talismans - which were in fact the first two Enochian documents - wer e to be employed together, the pentacle being placed on the Holy Table while in us e. Now events moved swiftly. On 14 March a spirit iden tified as the angel Michael gave instructions for making a magic ring o f gold bearing a seal said to be identical to that \"wherewith all miracles and divin e works and wonders were wrought by Solomon.\" 4 This is the design:"},{"pageNumber":939,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 4 Six days later Uriel dictated a square of 49 charac ters containing seven angelic names, thus: Starting with the left-hand column and reading from the top downwards, the following names are produced: Zaphkiel, Zedekiel, C umael, Raphael, Hanael, Michael, and Gabriel - with the sign of the cross e mployed to close the last place. On the following day, 21 March, a second square was su pplied b y Ur iel. Now the method of interpretations begins to wax com plicated.

Then, reading in still different directions along t he diagonals, one obtains the names of another twenty-eight spirits - seven each of Daughters of Light, Sons of Light, Daughters of the Daughters of Light, and Son s of the Sons of Light. For the sake of simplicity and because the names in questio n appear on the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, I give all these results in tabular form. *In line 1 the angelic name should be Kokabiel, and in line 6 it should be Semesiel - to agree with the Hebrew names of Mercur y and Sol. But I give the names as Kelley wrote them since the change of a si ngle letter on the square necessitates changing many other names obtained thr ough alternative modes of permutation. Shortly after the transcription of these squares Ke lley began to produce a copious amount of material concerning an angelical language. The Enochian alphabet appeared first - twenty-one characters, so mewhat like Ethiopic in styling though not in formation, and written like all Semit ic languages from right to left. This was followed by a book containing almost one h undred squares, many of them as large as 2,401 characters (49x49), whose dictati on became the principal business of all the sittings for nearly fourteen months. And the material continued to pile up, page after page, book after book, until the final p arting between Dee and Kelle y in 1589. What are we to make of these angelic conferences? The classic answer, of course, takes a tripartite f orm. First it is suggested that Dee was a sincere and pious but rather silly o ld man who from first to last was thoroughly cozened and deluded. Next it is alleged that Kelley was a liar and a charlatan whose \"revelations\" were a conscious exer cise in forgery, a forgery which had, moreover the advantage of being fool-proof sin ce it appears from Dee's spiritual diary that he himself rarely, if indeed e ver, claimed to see or hear the angelic visitants. Third and finally, it is conclud ed that the spirits answering to the stone were either (a) Satanic imposters or (b) figm ents of Kelley's fertile invention. Such, in bald outline, is the answer pro posed by Casaubon in his 54-page preface"},{"pageNumber":941,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 6 to A True and Faithful Relation. 5 And since Thomas Smith, in the book that for more than two hundred years stood as the standa rd biography of Dee followed Casaubon's lead and dismissed the angelic conferenc es as \"execrable insanity,\" such in essence is the view that prevails today. Having studied off and on for seventeen years the r ecords of the conferences, I find all this a gross distortion of the evidence. There is no question that Kelley had a broad streak of opportunism: but almost from the be ginning we find him openly doubting the nature of his spiritual contacts, prot esting that their nature is diabolical and not angelic. He tells Dee that they are deluder s, that his \"heart standeth against them,\" that their promises cannot be relied upon. D uring the sittings he is constantly on the alert to catch the spirits out and embarrass them. On one occasion he convicts them of plagiarising from Cornelius Agripp a. To adopt the view, as the devotees of the fraud theory have done, that Kelley 's constant endeavour to break off the conferences at almost any cost was merely a cle ver way of titillating Dee's enthusiasm is to ignore the obvious. For the one th ing more likely than any other to make Dee abandon the conferences would have been a genuine doubt as to the nature of the spirits. And if one thing is clear from the thousands of pages of manuscript records, it is that Kelley was deeply frightened an d intimidated by the spiritual forces he felt to be arra yed against him. For all his vaci llation and instability, he was never reall y dissuaded from his conviction that the y were too dangerous to meddle with. As for Dee himself, it is simply not the case that he meekly accepted everything he was told. Most of the time he is a model of caut ion. He notes ever y question and ever y answer; and if a discrepancy appears, he dema nds that it be explained before going on. He is all humility when pra ying t o God - but in the matter of revelation he is more than read y to \"tr y the spirits whether t he y are of God.\" P aradoxicall y enough, however, the most substantial and convincing proof of the essential genuineness of both Dee and Kelley is the ir monumental ignorance of what to do with the material they have accumulated. The thing that distinguishes Enochian magic as taught by the Golden Dawn is that it makes possible an astonishingl y effective and powerful synthesis of b oth theoretical and practical occult philosophy. In the hands of Dee and Kelley t he Enochian material remained a useless mass of letters and squares; and if Kelley feared it and Dee revered it, the salient fact is that neither of them ever accomplis hed an ything with it. But in the hands of Macgregor Mathers and his colleagues the E nochian s ystem stood revealed as a true concourse of all the forces in the macroc osm Sephirotic, elemental, planetary and astral. It fused Kabbalah, tarot, ast rology, and geomanc y into a unified psychological field. Its map of the planes is the most comprehensive, and at the same time the most practical, that I have ever encountered. In short, the method works: it unlocks the secret doors of the mind as n o other published s ystem has ever done. ENOCHIAN POSSIBILITIES At the same time, I do not wish to suggest that the Enochian system as organised by the Golden Dawn founders is complete a nd perfect be yond all possibilit y of improvement."},{"pageNumber":942,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 7 That, I am respectfully convinced, is not the case. Over and beyond the forty- eight Angelic Ke ys, the four Watchtowers, and the T ablet of Union there is a substantial body of Enochian documents whose invest igation will greatly repa y the student who has already assimilated and understood the available Golden Dawn material.

The operation of the Sigillum occurs in the worlds of Y etzirah and Briah.

The seven small sig ils, reading clockwise from the top, are associated with Luna, S aturn, Jupiter, Mar s, S ol, Venus, and Mercur y. Students of the Angelic Keys will recall that of th e nineteen calls the first is unexpressed, being attributed to the Godhead.

ENOCHIAN NUMBERS Having associated myself with Israel Regardie's cal l for greater openness with occult teaching material, I now wish to share with readers of this book some of the results of my own research. The quotation from John Dee's spiritual diaries with which I headed up this paper was written at the tim e the Angelic Keys were being dictated. Closely read and taken in context, it sug gests not only that the Keys may involve more than one numbering system, but also th at \"the Letters\" i.e., the characters of the Enochian alphabet, ma y be \"in con fusion\" in the sense that the traditional order may not be correct. Much more pla inly, in part three of \"The Concourse of the Forces\" MacGregor Mathers states: \"The numbers such as 456 and 6739, etc. which occur in some of the Calls contain mysteries not here to be explained.\" Following these and similar hints throughout Dee's diaries, as well as some of the manuscript books discussed above, I have bee n able to establish three conclusions with a rather high degree of rigour: fi rst, that there are in fact two numbering systems in Enochian, of which one is used for gematria and the other only for translating letters into single digits; second, that the correct order of characters in the Enochian alphabet resembles that in Greek and C optic; and, third, that the Gematric Code (as I propose to call it) follows a p attern rather more like Hebrew.

As the P uritan divine J ohn W ebster pointed out in A Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft ( London, 1677) Casaubon's True & Faithful Relation was an ything but an unbiassed account. To the contrar y, Casaubon had deliberatel y set out to \"register Dee among the damned\" and for a pe rfectly logical if self-serving reason. A few years earlier he had argued in print that all divine inspiration (so called) was nothing \"but imposture or melancholy or depraved phantasie, arising from natural causes.\" Cromwell's government took a dim view of that suggestion, and Casaubon found himself charged with atheism; wh ereupon he decided to \"leap to the other end\" by publishing some sensational te xt that would proclaim the existence of good and bad spirits alike. He did not , as Webster carefully notes, endeavour to destroy Dee's reputation out of person al malice or even out of personal conviction. For the true and faithful Casaubon the whole point was merely to bolster his own position as a good Christian.

Our earliest knowledge of this alphabet and languag e is derived from the skrying of Sir Edward Kelley and Dr. John Dee towar ds the end of the sixteenth century. This was in the time both of Mary Queen of Scots and Queen Elizabeth the First of England. In point of fact, Dr. John Dee be came Queen Elizabeth's friend, astrologer and confidante. According to some of the latest research, Dr. John Dee was not the gullible, credulous spiritualist as som e critics have alleged, but was in fact a true man of the Renaissance - a competent sc ientist, geographer and interestingl y enough, a secret agent under the tute lage of Sir Francis W alsingham. This alphabet and language is called Angelic or Eno chian, as the Angels who instructed both Dee and Kelley claimed to be those who had once conversed with the patriarch Enoch of the Bible. Kelley was the skryer and used a shewstone or crystal ball, which is now in the British Museum. In this b all he saw Angels who instructed him to make large charts and designs which Dr. Dee would have before him on a desk, while Kelley was skrying. When an Angel in th e shewstone would point to a certain letter on one of his charts, Kelley, in his turn, would pass the information on to Dr. Dee as for example: Tablet B, Column 7, Rank II, etc. Dr. Dee would locate the letter and write it down, awaiting the next. This was a slow and tedious method of gaining infor mation. All of these conversations and instructions were recorded b y Dr. Dee in diaries, still to be found in the British Museum in the Sloane and Harle ian collection of manuscripts. In the year 1659, Meric Casaubon published a large tome reproducing the details of some of these conversations and instructions. In th is book are to be found dozens of prayers offered humbly by Dee that he be guided in the right direction; man y are beautiful, others are long and tedious. From this basic material has grown one of the most complete s ystems of magical endeavor that was ever so beautifull y and s ystematicall y organiz ed, be yond even the wildest dreams of Dee and Kelley, b y the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn towards the end of the nineteenth centu r y. As can be seen when consulting Meric Casaubon, many of the invocations - or Calls as they are named, dictated by the Angels, we re given in reverse. It was felt that the Enochian words were so powerful that direct dic tation would call forth powers and forces not then desired. The present dictionary in this Volume of the Enochian language has been complied from words used in the n ineteen invocations that were given to Dee and Kelle y. Over a period of time, it has become possible to separate the prefixes and suffixes from the basic Enochian w ords. Since I am no philologist this was no easy task, especially as it was soon re cognized that in the process of repeated copyings, by uninformed members of the Gol den Dawn, many errors had crept into the text. W ords in one invocation had to be checked against similar words in another invocation to arrive at some sembl ance of accurac y."},{"pageNumber":948,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 13 Recently the words in this dictionary have been che cked against those found in Casaubon's enormous tome. Even here, a fantastic number of errors were perceived and I beca me aware of what a momentous ta sk it had been to compile this dictionary in the mid-thirties. Though ordinarily 1 have assiduously avoided self-p raise, I must confess, as I examine this dictionary after a time interval of nearly fifty years, that as simple dictionaries go, this is not such a bad job after a ll. The separation of the suffixes and prefixes from the proper r a t words was, in itself, no mean accomplishment. especially when one considers that no clue is to be found either in the Golden Dawn documents or in Crowley's renditions of the Calls i n Equinox !, #8. Languages are not amongst my few accomplishments. My English is g ood, m y F rench is execrable (as the maitre d' of a French restaurant I u sed to frequent can testif y), I know but little Latin and Greek. S o far as Hebrew is concern ed, though I did study that intensively years ago, with the intent of translati ng some old Qabalistic texts, that project vanished into thin air before my sec ond dec ade was out. The Enochian language is not just a haphazard combi nation and compilation of divine and angelic names drawn from the Tablets. Apparently, it is a true language with a grammar and syntax of its own. Onl y a superficial study of the invocations suffice to indicate this to be a fact. The invocations are not strings of words and barbarous names, but are sentences which can be translated in a meaningful way and not merely transliterated. The Enochian language is without any history prior to the skrying of Edward Kelley and J ohn Dee. There is no record of its prio r existence, regardless of some fanciful theories which have been invented to accou nt for it. Man y present-da y philologists have often pointed out that it is impo ssible for any single human being to invent a language of his own, complete with erro rs, such as we find in the transcribing in Dr. Dee's diaries. Any inventor tod a y would be careful enough to be more thorough in the construction of his language t han were D ee and Kelle y, or the Angels who originally dictated the Calls. The Enochian alphabet consists of twent y-one letter s which can be transposed into English. The individual letters are known to us in both the printed or elaborate style and also in a script or cursive form. One of the curious anomalies about this Enochian al phabet is that each letter has a name, as in other languages, such as in Greek : Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc., but this Enochian name bears absolutely no relationship to the sound value of the letter itself. Alpha in Greek is given the sound value of A; in Hebrew Gimel is given the sound value of G, etc.: but in Enochian, Veh, has t he sound value of C or K, not of V, as one might at first have supposed. Since the names of the letters are not commonly use d, the use of the English alphabetical order and pronunciation is recommended in order to avoid confusion or unnecessar y complication. In the text is shown t he Enochian alphabet in both the elaborate and cursive style and also in the ord er given us by tradition. In passing, I should note that the cursive st yle is us ed but rarel y, and for that reason is not worth committing to memor y. In the original Golden Dawn papers written by MacGregor Mathers and William W ynn W escott, certain rules were laid down for the pronunciation of the Enochian words. Mathers advised that the consonants should be followed by the vowel which obtains in the"},{"pageNumber":949,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 14 corresponding Hebrew letters. For ex ample: the word \"sobha\" could be pronounced soh-bay-hah. The god-names, like MPH ARS L GAIOL, to be found in the Water Tablet, are pronounced as: Em-pay-hay Ar- sel Gah-ee-Ohl. The one major exception to all rules is that the letter Z is always pronounced as zoad. So that the word Zamran is pronounced as Zoad-ah-mer-ah-noo. Dr. W escott laid down similar rules in another docu ment he wrote for the Adeptus Minor, but his version gives several variat ions which should be noted. I have found these latter to be valid, making for gre ater euphon y and ease in handling. He said: \"M is pronounced em; N is pronou nced en (also Nu or Noo - since in Hebrew the vowel following the equivalent letter Nun is used); A is pronounced ah; P is peh; S is ess; D is deh.\" This rule, in fact, simplifies the entire procedure, If one had no further rules than these, the entire matter of Enochian pronunciation, which has been unnecessarily obscured and rendered so dif ficult, could then be handled with ease. Another variation is that Y, J and I are similar to the Yod in Hebrew - as U and V are similar to the Vau in Hebrew. X has somet imes the value of S amekh and at others of Tz addi, though there is no reason not to use it as in English. Usage and experience will ultimately dictate which one is to be employed. Let me give several examples of words chosen relati vely at random in order to exemplify the simplicity of the process of pronunci ation. These names are to be found in the Tablet of Union: EXARP Ex-ar-p ay HCOMA Hay-coh -mah NANTA En -ah -en-tah BITOM Bay-ee-toh-em Though it has been suggested b y W escott that every letter should be pronounced separately, this idea makes for clumsine ss, lack of euphony and unnecessary length, which creates fatigue and monot on y. Further ex amples are: CHIS Cah- hee-sah CHIS GE Cah - h is-jee The student must use not merely these rules but his own sense of euphony and intuition in dealing with this matter. Remember, th ere is no final version which is absolutel y authoritative. In the P ortal grade of The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic (Falcon P ress, P hoenix 1983) there is a ver y short Enochian invocation which is abbreviated from the First Call, but also contains the names of three Archangels drawn from the Tablet of Union. I give the invocati on first, followed by its transliteration in pronunceable phrases."},{"pageNumber":950,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 15 \" OL SONUF VAORS AGI GOHO IADA BALTA.

I might add in passing that this is an Invocation I have used frequently over the last forty-odd years, primaril y in relationship to the p ractice of the Middle Pillar technique (which I have improved and enhanced, to b e published b y Falcon P ress under the title The Sceptre of Power) and the Ritual of the \"W atch Tower Ceremon y\" in this volume. \" Oh-el Soh-noof Vay-oh-air-sah-jee, Goho Ee-ah-dah B altah.

The major obstacle at first encountered is simpl y the strangeness of the appearance of the words and the lack of experience in pursuing the rules laid down. The sounds may seem very much like pure gibberish at the outset. If he persists, however, the student will s oon learn to disentangle the sounds from apparent chaos and find himself confron ted by a meaningful language and a meaningful set of invocations. In any event, do remember there is no absolute or final rendition of the way to pronounce these Ca lls. If he can approximate the instructions laid down here, his own version will b e as authoritative as an y. In 1976, an Enochian Dictionary was published by Le o Vinci entitled GMICALZOMA through the Regenc y Press in England. I have no com ments to make about it, other than that it is a workable and usable dictionary. It post-dates my Dictionary b y many years, mine having begun to c irculate in the U.S. and the United Kingdom a score of years earlier. Not too long after that, Askin Publishers in Englan d became interested in my dictionary and a correspondence ensued relative to having them publish mine. A friend, a philologist, promised to write an Introdu ction to it with a view to elucidating the origins of the Enochian language. A gain, a series of mishaps occurred which prevented the Introduction from bein g written. It resulted in Askin Publishers taking the lead, and offering to get Dr. Laycock (an Australian philologist who had been in touch with me sometime before this) to do an Introduction for it. W hen the Introduction arrived, I was m ost disappoin ted in it, feeling that it exuded contempt and ridicule."},{"pageNumber":951,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 16 M y nex t step was to telephone Askin P ublishers in L ondon to confess my total disappointment and stating that if they insis ted on publishing La ycock's Introduction with my Dictionar y, I would withdraw t he latter. S o it came to pass that Askin P ublishers returned my Dictionary at my request. Sometime in the next immediate period they must have formulated a Dictio nar y which the y published with the La ycock Intr oduction. These facts need to be mentioned solely to establis h the priority of my Dictionary. Not that that matters ver y much. There was a need for this Dictionar y amongst students of Magic, and someone got there fi rst. The histor y of the Enochian Dictionar y that is bein g published here should not be without interest. S hortly after having benn elevated to the Adeptus M inor Grade, I began an intensive study of the Enochian system, including t he beginning of a Dictionary. The study of the system resulted in my writing a pa per entitled An Addendum to the Book of the Concourse of Forces, included in this volume. Within a couple of years, the Dictionary had achieved a well-defined f orm -- that is by 1940-41. Then World War II intervened, when it was put aside with a number of other similar projects until the 1950's. During that time, the Di ctionar y was loaned to a number of different people on both sides of the Atlantic. Ordinarily I would not use names, but in this instance I feel it is incumbent upon me to do so. There was a young man in S urrey, a protege of an os teopathic friend of mine A.E. Charles, to whom I lent it early in the 1 950's -- altogether apart from a handful of students here in the U.S. Somewhere arou nd 1956, 1 was visited in Los Angeles by Miss Tamara Bourkoun, a ver y ardent and knowledgeable student of Co-Masonry and the occult. Amongst other things, in cluding the Golden Dawn Tarot Deck, I loaned her the Enochian Dictionary with my permission to copy it for her use if she so willed. From then on, it had some kind of circulation here and there among the more serious students of Magic who took the Enochian s ystem seriousl y. Earl y in the 1970's S an greal Found ation , who had already published several of my things, were to ying with the idea of seeing that the Enochian Dictionary was finall y published. However again some unforesee n events occurred which precluded the possibilit y of that ha ppening. Now under the direction of the Israel Regardie Foundation and Falcon Press, this long awaited work has found itself in print, i n this particular volume."},{"pageNumber":952,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 17 A PREFATORY NOTE By V. H. FRATER, S .I.A. (Note: Official documents H and S are omitted here b y reason of their redundanc y and obscurit y, to be replaced by this mo re modern precis. I.R.) To the First Order little is said of the Tablets of Enoch. They ar e mentioned in the Rituals, but do not enter into the Knowledge Lectures. But the detailed study of the Tablets and their attributions and the method o f using them for vision forms a definite part of the course of work prescribed betw een 5 - 6 and the T.A.M. degree. The Order has in its possession a considerable mass of detailed instruction on this subject, but as it is contained in a number of papers, some of considerable antiquity and others modern, wherein part of the gr ound is covered two or three times over, while other parts are by no means clear ly explained, it has been felt that a paper attempting to cover the whole ground in logic al sequence ma y be of assistance to those beginning the study of Enochian a before they go on to the more elaborate and intricate papers on special branches of the subject. It is to be understood that this lecture does not c laim to sa y an yt hing new. It is a rearrangement and, I hope, a rather clearer ex planation of information already in possession of the Order, and is intended to be w hat it is called - an Introduction to, not a substitute for, the other Enochian litera ture. The Order possesses a set of the Tablets completely worked out in detail, which can be consulted to illustrate the text where necessar y. It is not necessary to make a copy of it, which would take some months, bu t it is strongly recommended that every Adeptus should make him or herself a set of the four Elemental Tablets as shown in the Temple, and a Tablet of Union, and have them by him when reading what follows. They may be made of coloured paper or painted in water colours. The lettering should be accurately copied and in the co rrect colouring. Half-inch squares make a very convenient size, the whole Tablet being then 6 in. x 6/ in. CHAPTER ONE THE ANGELIC S ECRET LANGUAGE THE CONS TRUCTION OF THE TABLETS It is stated in the 1 - 10 Ritual that the Tablet o f Earth, (and of course it applies to the others) \"is written in what our trad ition calls the Angelic Secret Language.\" The Tablets in use in the Outer Temple a re lettered with English letters. but these are in fact a translation, or rather a tr ansliteration, of ver y ancient characters belonging to what is known as the Theban Alphabet. There are two forms of the letters, the elaborate and the cursive. The Alphabet is as follows:"},{"pageNumber":953,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 18"},{"pageNumber":954,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 19 W hether its origin is now known is extremel y doubtf ul, but it is possibl y of great antiquity. Every letter on the English tablets, therefore, may be replaced by the corresponding letter of this alphabet. These letter s are reputed of greater magical force than Hebrew or English Letters and partake of the nature of sigils rather than simple letters. But this Angelic secret language, whatever its orig in, was a true language. In addition to the \"numberless Divine and Angelic Name s\" drawn from the Tablets, according to rules some of which will be dealt with later, there are extant in this language a number of \"Enochian Calls,\" or invocatio ns of the Forces of the Tablets. These are not mere strings of Names, but can be tra nslated, not merely transliterated into English. For example, the Call in the opening of the P ortal Ceremon y: OL S ONUF VA-ORS AGI GOHO IADA BALATA ELEXARPEH COMANANU TABITOM: ZODAKARA EKA ZODAKARE OD ZODAMRANU: ODO KIKLE QAA PIAPE PIAMOEL OD VAOAN. This means: \"I will reign over you, saith the God o f J ustice, 0 Lex arph, Comananu, Tabitom. Move, therefore, and show yourse lves forth and appear; declare unto us the m ysteries of your Creation, the Balance of Righteousness and Truth.\" It is stated in the 5 - 6 Ritual that some of our e arly brethren compiled a dictionary of this language; whether it now survive s, I do not know. (In more recent years I have compiled a dictionar y which will be fo und towards the end of this volume. I.R.) The language is pronounced b y taking each letter separatel y, whenever a lack of vowels renders it necessar y; but the pronunciation seems to come to one instinctivel y when one wants it. Thus m , p, h is pronounced Em-peh, Hctga He-C-Te-Ga. Z is alwa ys pronounced ZOD (o as in bone). Thus in the Name lc Zod Heh Chal, Great King of the North, the \" Zod \" is represented onl y b y a single Z on the Tablet of Earth. Let us now analyse the form and arrangement of the elemental Tablets. You may have noticed in the Outer Order Rituals that th e Tablet of Earth was called the Third or Great Northern Quadrangle, Air the First, Water the Second and Fire the Fourth, and possibly wondered why this order, and w hy the Third was given in the First Grade. Put your four Tablets together in two pairs, thus:"},{"pageNumber":955,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 20 And you will then see that they thus correspond to the four elemental angles of the Pentagram, the angle of Spirit answering to the Tablet of Union. Also this is the order of the four lesser angles of each separat e Tablet, and the four together form a sort of super-Tablet with the elements simil arl y arranged . Now let us take one of the Tablets, and examine it more closely. To avoid confusion, I will refer throughout to the Tablet of Air, it being understood that m y remarks appl y, mutatis mutandis, to the others, unl ess the y are speciall y mentioned. First you will notice that there are twelve squares horizontall y, and thirteen verticall y, making 156 in all, or 624 in the four T ablets altogether. Of these 156, 76 are white, and 80 ar e coloured. The two groups must be separatel y considered. Each is divisible into two other groups. (A) Th e White S qu ares in to th e Great Cross and th e F ou r S ephirotic Crosses. (B) Th e Colou red Squ ares in to Keru bic and S ervien t S qu ares. Th e Wh ite Squ ares. These are alwa ys lettered in black. The Great Cross. This consists of the two central v ertical lines, and the central horizontal line - total, 36 squares. The two vertic al lines are called the \"Linea Dei Patris Filiique,\" and the horizontal line as the \"L inea Spiritus Sancti,\" thus referring to the Divine Triad, and also to the Spirit control ling the four elements in the lesser angles which are separated from each other b y the G reat Cross. The Four Sephirotic Crosses. These are formed of th e central vertical line and the second horizontal line in each lesser angle. S o me confusion has been introduced into their attributions in some of our l iterature, b y C hesed and Geburah being placed at the extremities of the cross-piece instead of Chokmah and Binah. The latter form, which is that given in Az oth, is b elieved to be correct. Th e Colou red Squ ares. The letters on these are coloured as follows: (a) In the lesser angle corresponding to the Element of the Tablet itself, in the complementary colour to the ground work - i. e. purple on the airy quarter of Air, orange on the w ater y quarter of W ater; green i s taken as the colour for the earth y quarter of Earth (black having strictl y no c omplementary colour), and green on the fier y quarter of Fire. (b) In the other three lesser angles of each Tablet, in the colour of the element of the lesser angle. The King's Scale is us ed, Air being yellow; Water, blue; Earth, black; and Fire, red. Kerubic Squares. These are the four squares above t he Cross-bar of the Sephirotic Cross in each lesser angle. The order of their attribution to the Kerubim varies according to the lesser angle, in a manner p resentl y to be explained. The sixteen S ervient S quares. These are the remaini ng coloured squares below the Cross-bar of the Sephirotic Cross in each lesser angle, and their attribution is dependent on that of the Kerubic squares."},{"pageNumber":956,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 21 These four distinct groups will require to be separ ately treated throughout, and in each Chapter I shall deal with them in this Order. In general it may be remembered that the white squares always have Spiri t as one of their attributions, the coloured squares never: they are alwa ys elemental. Th e Tablet of Un ion Is shown in the Portal Ceremony consisting of 20 wh ite squares, arranged in 4 horizontal rows of 5, and thus attributed, coloured and lettered as follows: 1st Lin e. Air - Yellow letters - E X A R P 2n d Lin e. Water - Blue letters - H C O M A 3rd Lin e. Earth - Black letters - N A N T A 4th Lin e. Fire - Red letters - B 1 T 0 M. All are attributed to Spirit in part, and the lette rs are used in combination with those of the other four tablets in the formati on of certain Names as explained in the next chapter. CHAPTER TWO THE FORMATION OF DIVINE AND ANGELIC NAMES FROM THE TABLETS We now consider the mode of forming the more import ant of the \"numberless Divine and Angelic Names\" from the Tablets. Th e Wh ite Squ ares. 1. The Great Cross. From the Great Cross of each Ta blet are formed ten Names of importance for present purposes. 1.2.3. Th e \"Three Great Holy S ecret Names of God\" occupy the whole of the Linea Spiritu s Sancti, reading from left to right. They consist in each Tablet of a Name of 3 l etters, one of 4 letters, and one of 5 letters, thus: ORO IBAH AO LP I, answering to I.A.O . These are the Names borne on the Three Banners carr ied before the face of 4, the \"Great King\" of each quarter. This is always a Name of eight letters, and occupies the centre of the Cross, beginning at the 5th lette r of the Linea S piritus S ancti, and reading in a spiral through the two letters of the Linea D ei P atris Filiique immediately above the Linea Spiritus Sancti to the 8th letter of the Linea Spiritus Sancti, through the letters of the Linea Del immedi ately below the Linea Spiritus Sancti, and ending with the 6th and 7th letters of the Linea Spiritus S ancti. Thus:"},{"pageNumber":957,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 22 The King is a very powerful force, to be invoked wi th due care. 5.6.7.8.9.10. The Six Seniors, whose Names begin from the 6th and 7th squares of the Linea Spiritus Sancti, and read outwards along the three lines in each direction to the edge of the Tablet. Each is a Name of seven letters. Of the two formed in the Linea Spiritus Sancti, one will therefore be the first tw o Names of God reversed, thus ORO IBAH; Senior, HABIORO. The other will be the third Deity Name, prefixed by the last two letters of the second, thus: ORO IBAH AOZP I, where AHAOZP I is the Name of a S enior. All these Names belong to a different and higher pl ane than those of the elemental squares, and are invoked by the Hexagram, not the Pentagram. The King and Six Seniors are attributed to the S un and Plane ts."},{"pageNumber":958,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 23 2. The S ephirotic Crosses. The Vertical line read downwards gives a Deity Name of six letters, used to call forth the angels and spirits of the lesser angle. T he cross-bar from left to right gives a Deity Name of five letters which is used to command the spirits called forth by the first Name. These two Names should be used in a pre liminary invocation when working with a square of the lesser angle. If we re verse the Names, reading them upwards and from right to left, we get those of the evil forces calling forth and controlling the evil angels of the lesser angle, wh ich needless to sa y, should not be done - b y the Z.A.M. at an y rate. 3. The coloured squares. From each square a Name is formed b y t aking the fou r letters in the four coloured squares of one horizontal row of the lesse r angle, beginning with the letter in the square whose Name is desired, and reading le ft to right. In the Kerubic squares of the airy Angle of Air we have RZLA for the first ; ZLAR for the second, LARZ for the the third; ARZL for the fourth. Remembering the rule as to pronunciation, these will be ERZODELAH , ZODELARE, LARZOD, ARZODEL. From each of these four-letter Names is formed a mo re powerful Name of five letters which rules it, b y prefixing a letter from the Tablet of Union as follows: I. Kerubic Squares. Always (whatever the lesser ang le) the first letter of the appropriate line of the Tablet of Union: thus from RZLA we shall form ERZLA, from DOPA in the Tablet of Fire BDOPA. These Names from the Kerubic squares rule those in the servient squares, and the first, i.e. that of the left-hand Kerubic square, is the chief of them. 2. The Servient Squares. The remaining letters of t he Tablet of Union are thus allotted: The second letter of each line to the 16 squares of the angle of Air. The third letter of each line to the 16 squares of the angle of Water. The fourth letter of each line to the 16 squares of the angle of Earth. The fifth letter of each line to the 16 squares of the angle of Fire. Evil names are formed b y taking two adjoining lette rs instead of four, prefixing the appropriate Tablet of Union letter an d reading from right to left, or left to right. The formation of these Names is dealt with much mor e fully in the \"Clavicula Tabularum Enochi,\" one of the more ancient of our d ocuments on the Tablets. CHAPTER THREE THE ATTRIBUTION TO THE NAME YHVH The Great Name YHVH is the Key to the whole system of Enochian attribution of the squares to the elements. The let ters of the Name are thus attributed: Yod to Fire and Wan ds; Heh to Water and Cu ps; Vau to Air and Sw ord s; Heh (f in al) to Earth and Pen tacles."},{"pageNumber":959,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 24 Once more put your Tablets together as in Chapter O ne. Put the appropriate letter at the outside corner of each, and you will find the Name YHVH reads round counter-clockwise, beginning with the fiery angle o f Fire, and taking in each tablet the lesser angle of its own element. Then fill in t he letters appropriate to the lesser angles of each tablet and you will find them also f orming the Name in the same way, while in the middle of the Four Tablets is the Name again, beginning with the fiery lesser angle of Air. S o much for its general attrib ution. W e now consider it in detail. Th e Wh ite Squ ares. 1. The Great Cross. Divide each vertical and horizo ntal line into four groups of three adjoining squares. Against the two top gro ups and the left hand group put the letter of the Name corresponding to the element of the Great Tablet. In the case of Air this will be Vau. The name reads upwards and fr om right to left, so below Vau and to its right we put Heh; below that and on its right Yod, leaving Heh Final for the bottom and right hand groups. Thus: Each square represents three squares on the Tablets. This attribution is perfectly simple if it be remembered that the lette r consonant to the Tablet always comes to the top and left."},{"pageNumber":960,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 25 2. The Sephirotic Crosses represent the Sephiroth m odified by the letter of the lesser angle. Thus they will be Kether of Vau in th e airy lesser angle, of Heh in the watery, and so on. The attributions of these Crosse s otherwise are constant in all angles of all tablets. The coloured Squares. 1. The Kerubic Squares. The Attribution of the Lett ers of the Name to the Four Kerubic Squares of each lesser angle is a little mo re complicated, but is still quite easy if the following rules are remembered. (a) The outside square is always attributed to the l etter corresponding to the element of the lesser angle. Thus in the four a iry lesser angles the left hand square is attributed to Vau, in the four watery the right hand square always to Heh; in the four earthy the left-hand square always to Heh (fin al); in the four fiery the right hand square always to Yod. (b) In the Tablets of Air and Water the Name reads r ight to left in the two upper quarters, left to right in the two lower. In the Tablets of Earth and Fire, it reads left to right in the two upper quarters, right to l eft in the two lower. Thus if the four tablets are placed together, we have four rows, run ning thus: Applying these rules to the four lesser angles of A ir, we get: Airy quarter: Vau placed on the left, by rule (a) i n that order in the other three, by rule (b). Watery quarter: Heh placed on the right by rule (a) on its left in that order, by rule (b). Earthy quarter: Heh (final) placed on the left by r ule (a) on its right in that order by rule (b). Fiery quarter: Yod placed on the right, by rule (a) on its left in that order by rule (b). In the Earth and Fire Tablets a curious result foll ows. Take the airy and watery angles. In Air, Vau, on the left followed by Heh, Y od, Heh, brings Heh on the right; and in water, Heh, on the right similarly brings on the left, so that the attribution of the Kerubic squares (and hence, as we shall see, of the servient squares) is alike in the upper pair of angles and in both Tablets. The same thing happens in the earthy and fiery angles. Heh on the left brings"},{"pageNumber":961,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 26 Yod on the right, and vice versa. So the attributio ns of the Kerubic squares of the right lesser angles of the two lower tablets have o nly two arrangements, viz: for the upper and for the lower angles. This does not mean that t he squares will be identical; as we shall see later, their elemental composition will differ in each lesser angle. 1. The S ervient squares. These, it will be remembered, are in four vertical columns of four squares, or four horizontal ranks of four squares. To avoid confusion the word \"column\" will be used to d en ote vertical, an d th e w ord \" ran k\" to d en ote h orizon tal rows invariab ly. The four columns follow the order of the four Kerub ic squares always. The four squares under Heh are also attributed to Heh and so forth. The four ranks are also dependent on the four Kerubic squares, and whatever order these are in, right to left is the order of the servient ranks downwards. This rul e is invariable, and does NOT depend on whether the Name reads right to left or l eft to right. Ex amples: Air of Air Air of Fire Heh (f ) Yod Heh Vau Heh Yod Heh (f ) Vau Heh (f ) 1st Rank Heh 1st Ran k Yod 2n d Ran k Yod 2n d Ran k Heh 3rd Rank Heh (f ) 3rd Rank Vau 4th Rank Vau 4th Rank Thus each servient square has a double attribution, by column and rank, no two being alike in the same lesser angle. We may get He h, Heh column and Vau, Vau Rank, or Vau, Vau Column and Heh, Heh Rank. The other att ributions will be quite different in the two cases (in one case to Pisces, the Moon o f the Tarot Trumps; Qoph and Laetitia; in the other to Aquarius, the Star; Tz addi and Tris titia.) But these other attributions are dependent on those to the Name, which are, as has been said, the key to the system, and should be tho roughly mastered before going on to work out the corresponding Astrological, Tarot, and Geomantic attributions as explained in the next chapter. CHAPTER FOUR THE ASTROLOGICAL, TAROT, HEBREW AND GEOMANTIC ATTRI BUTIONS Th e Wh ite Squ ares. 1. The Great Crosses refer to the 36 Decans of the Zodiac. The squares allotted to Yod will be fiery signs, those to Heh watery signs, tho se to Vau airy, those to Heh final earthy. It will be remembered that in attributing the lette rs of the Name we took groups of three squares. Each group of three represents one sign, t he separate squares being allotted to the three Decans as ruled by the Planets. The Decans of each sign go downwards or from left to"},{"pageNumber":962,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 27 right in order. The four Kerubic signs and their De cans occupy the Linea Spiritus Sancti, the four Cardinal signs the left s ide of the Linea Dei Patris Filiique, and the four mutable the right side. Those familiar with the Tarot papers will remember that the Decans start with the first Decan of Leo ruled by Saturn, the planets following in their order, except that Mars rules the last decan of Pisces and the first of Aries. The 36 smaller cards of the Tarot a re also allotted to these squares, each in that of its own decan; note that the 2, 3, and 4 of each suit go with the Cardinal sign; 5, 6, 7 with the Kerubic; and 8, 9, and 10 wi th the Mutable. Thus in the Air Tablet we get:"},{"pageNumber":963,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 28 2. The Sephirotic Crosses. The top square, and the five squares of the Cross-b ar are allotted to six of the seven planets, excluding Saturn. The arrangement is const ant, but is not the usual attribution of the Planets to the Sephiroth as on the Hexagram. It is as follows: The corresponding Hebrew letters and Tarot Trumps a re allotted to these squares. The remaining four squares have no astrological att ribution, but in addition to the six trumps the ten squares of each Cross are allotted t o the Ace and small cards of the suit attributed to the element of the lesser angle. The Coloured squares. 1. The Kerubic squares. These are allotted, as their Name implies to the four Kerubim whose emblems follow the order of the Lette rs of the Name: to Yod; to Heh; to Vau; to Heh (final) in each lesser angle. They are also allotted to the four Court Cards of the Tarot suit which corresponds to the lesser angle, Swords to Air, Cups to Water, Pentacles to Earth and Wands to Fire on each Tablet. Of the four Court Cards themselves the King is attributed to Yod, the Queen to Heh, the Knight to Vau, and th e Knave to Heh (final). 2. The Servient Squares. These are allotted as follows: to the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac, with the symbols of Air, Water and Fire, and Saturn which is also Earth and to the corresponding 16 Trumps, Hebrew Letters and Geomantic figures. (a) The Columns go by triplicity according to the el ement of the Kerubic square at the head of the column. e.g. under Yod and Leo will be Aries, Leo, Sagittarius and Fire, with Heh, Tau, Samekh, and Shin, Emperor, Strength, Temp erance, and Last Judgment, and so with the other columns. (b) The ranks go by Quality: To Yod and Fire are allotted the four Cardinal Sign s; Heh and Water are allotted the four Kerubic Signs Vau and Air are allotted the four Mutable Signs Heh (final) and Earth are allotted the four Element al symbols. Thus under Heh in the Yod rank will be, Cancer, the Chariot, Cheth, and Populus. Thus under Heh in the Heh rank will be, Scorpio, Death, Nun, and Rubeus. Thus under Heh in the Vau rank will be, Pisces, the Moon, Qoph, and Laeti tia.

Since 156 equals 78 x 2, it might have been expecte d that each Tarot card would come twice on each Tablet and no more, but it will be seen that this is not so, for: (a) The 22 Trumps occur 4 times, once in each lesser angle. The 12 allotted to Simple Letters, the 3 allotted to the T hree Mothers, and the Universe allotted to Tau and Saturn, come in the Servient sq uares, and the other six of the Double Letters on the six uppermost squares of the S ephirotic Cross. The apparent anomal y of the position of S aturn is thus explained in the \"Book of the Concourse of Forces\". \"Now in the attribution of the Tarot Ke ys hereunto, Universe is attributed to Earth and Saturn though one of the se ven `Lords who wander' is yet here classed with those who abide, because he is the hea viest of the seven, and thus formeth a link between the Wanderers and the Abiders.\" The reason for the other attributions are also give n at some length in the same paper, and it is not worth-while to cop y them here.

CHAPTER FIVE THE PYRAMIDS OF THE SQUARES We have hitherto treated each square as a single wh ole and flat, but in reality it represents a Pyramid, shaped like the Pyramid of the elements in the Philosophus Grade with a square base and four sides composed of equilateral triangl es truncated or cut off so as to leave a flat top. We have now to consider the attribution of the sides of these Pyramids. They will, among them, include all the attributions of the square al ready worked out in the previous chapter (save that the Letter of the Name on which the rest depend does not actually appear); in addition, each side of the Pyramid is coloured acco rding to its own appropriate element, or left white for Spirit. Hence it by no means follows that a square from the airy angle of Air will have an all yellow pyramid - only two (one Ker ubic and one Servient) in fact, do so. But every square of the Air Tablet has at least one air y side to its Pyramid; and every square of the Airy Angle of any Tablet has at least one airy side; every square in Air of Air having at least two airy sides (similarly in Water of Water, Earth of Earth, and Fire of Fire). The elements of the Tablet and of the Lesser Angle, the refore, always predominate over the others. For example, in the airy angle of Air, out of 30 py ramids, with 120 sides: (This Schema applies mutatis mutandis to the lesser angle corresponding to the Element of the Tablet itself. Also note that the Earthy sides may be coloured in the four colours of Malkuth, Queen scale, if preferred.) 70 sides are yellow for Air 10 sides are blue for Water 10 sides are black for Earth 10 sides are red for Fire 10 sides are white for Spirit 10 sides are either white or in the Sephirotic colo urs from the Minutum Mundum.

Now the reason is this. It is true that Aleph, Mem, Tau, Shin equal Air, Water, Earth, and Fire, the purel y terrestrial acti on, but YHVH is a certain Name added unto them to control their vehemence. So that over the violent Element Fire is placed the gentle letter of Yod - Virgo to calm and purify its raging. Over the quiet and peace loving element Water is placed the strong letter Heh - Aries to awaken it unto a fitting display of energy. Over the changing and whirling element of Air is placed the firm and resolute Vau, - Taurus. Over th e stable and abiding earth is placed the ex citing force of Heh - Aries. S o that with these letters from among the 12 S imple Letters hath the Almight y administered the government and combinatio n of the Elements. Therefore is it that in these Tablets sheweth the law of thei r combination, and not Aleph, Mem, Tau, and Shin. Therefore is it that the name Y HVH is a name of vehemence of all the Elements and this vehemence is held boun d by it. But when the holy letter Shin of the Divine Spirit is placed therein it is r endered calm, seeing that the judgment is then set and the Book of Life opened. H erein also is a great Arcanum for it is a knowledge of the m yster y of life. Now each of these Terrestrial Tablets of the Elemen ts is divided into 4 Lesser Angles by the Great Central Cross which cometh fort h as from the Gate of the Watch Tower of the Element itself. The Horizontal L ine of each of these Three Great Crosses is named \"Linea Spiritus Sancti.\" The Perpendicular is called \"Linea Dei,\" the Line of God, of Father and S on, the \"P atr is Filiique,\" Macroprosopus and Microprosopus combined. For these 4 Vertical lines resemble 4 mighty Pillars each divided into twain by a light line shewing this for th; The Father Himself, in the absence of the line. And in its presence shewing th e Son. And as aforesaid the central points of these 4 Great Crosses do shew in the Celestial Heavens, and do correspond unto the 4 Tiphareth points referred to in the Book of the Astronomic view of the Tarot. Naturally then the Linea Spiritu s Sancti coincides with the Zodiacal Belt wherein is the Path of the Sun who is the administrant of The Spirit of Life, and \"The Lord of the Fire of the W orld.\" The Four Linea S . S . then form the complete circle of the Ecliptic, a circle at the ce ntre of the Zodiacal Circle. Therefore do the 4 Perpendicular or Vertical Lines of the 4 Crosses represent 4 Great Currents of Force passing between North abo ve and South below, intersecting the Tiphareth points and thus affirmin g the existence of the Hidden Central Pillar of the Tree of Life forming the Axis of the Sphere of the Celestial Heavens. Therefore are these Linea which are vertical called Linea Dei P atris Filiique, as manifesting that Central Column wherei n are Kether and Tiphareth, Macroprosopus and Microprosopus. The Calvary Cross of 10 Squares which are in each of the 4 Lesser Angles of each Tablet are attr ibuted unto the action of the Spirit through the 10 Sephiroth herein.

In their keeping are the sacred m ysteri es and the knowledge of Magic and all the Gods.\" In the Ritual of the 32nd Path leading unto the The oricus Grade, it is thus written: \"The Sphynx of Egypt spake and said: I am the synthesis of the Elemental Forces. I am also the s ymbol of Man. I am Life. I a m Death.

Therefore on its base is the word Olahm, meaning W o rld, and upon its sides are the names of the Elements: Aesh, Ruach, Mayi m, Aretz or Ophir. Yet the Apex is not allowed to remain vacant, not quite acute in shape, but is cut off and so a small square is formed at the Apex, and the Letters Eth, meaning Essence are placed therein.

It will be observed that the Elements are arranged in blocks of four words of fo ur letters each. The Spirit names consist each of five letters, the fifth being taken from the Tablet of Union. Thus in the Quadrangle of Fire, or Great S outhern Q uadrangle, we have BEH-EE-TOEM from the Tablet of Union, BITOM. BEH-DE H-OH-P EH-AH from Top of Calvary Cross is B, 1st Angle, Bdopa.

Bearing this in mind, place yourself in the centce of ahollow cube,standinginthe centre of the Tablet of Union be tween the 0 of HCOMA and the second N of NANTA, thus: EX ARP HCOMA Imagine yourself standing under (0). NA NTA BITOM"},{"pageNumber":985,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 50 Now imagine the Four Elemental Tablets standing rou nd you like the four walls of a room, at the four cardinal points. This is subjective working. Another method is to imagine a moonstone spheroid, containing the Universe, yourself standing as it were in the centre, and the Spirit Tablet or the Tablet of Union at the North and South P oles, at the same tim e dividing the surface into four quarters, imagining yourself outside the spheroid. This is objective working. These Tablets can be applied to the Universe, to th e S olar S ystem, to the Earth, or to Man himself. \"As above, so below.\" Perhaps the most convenient method for a beginner t o adopt is to apply this scheme to the Earth, treating the Three Deity Names as the Three Signs of the Zodiac in one quarter. Thus: take the Fire Tablet a nd place O IP on Leo, TEAA on Virgo, PDOCE on Libra, and so on with the other God Names, treating the Kerubic Sign as the \"point de depart,\" one quarter of a 1-l ouse in Astrology will also be roughly equal to the square of each letter. Each of these spaces would, under these circumstanc es, appear to be governed b y a heroic figure of say twelve feet high , not winged. But the Spirit Names and the Names above the Calvar y Cross, even on the Earth plane, bring forth Figures of tremendous siz e and beauty, which could easily lift a human being in the palm of the hand. I have seen from the fiery lesser angle of Fire AZOD IZOD, the Figure being fier y red with emerald green flaming w ings and hair. ZODAZODEE, Black and white, flashing and flaming. EEZODAHZOD, Blue and Orange, with a mist of flame. ZODEEZODAH, Orange, haz y gold wings like gold gauz e, and nets of gold around him. Having selected one of the methods given, perform t he Lesser Banishing Ritual with the S word. Invoke with Minor Implement the Element required. Our example being the Square of OM DI, a watery and earthy square in the lesser Angle of Earth in the Great Southern or Fire Quadrangle, we take the Fire Wand, and in the four Quarters invoke with the equi libriating P entagram for Actives, and the Fire P entagram using onl y the Tabl et names, sa ying: EDEL P ERNA - VOLEXDO and S IODA. \"I command ye in the Div ine Name OIP TEEA P EDOCE and BITOM that the Angel that governs the Wa tery and Earthy Square of OMEDEHEE shall obey my behest and submit to me when I utter the Hol y Name TEHOMEDEHEE.\" Having repeated this Invocation in the Four Quarter s, turn to the East if you wish to go to the plane, or to the South if you wis h to invoke the Spirits to come to you. Look at the painted Tablet which you have prep ared until you can carry it in your mind, then close the e yes and vibrate the name s OMEDHEE OEMDEHEE until your whole body trembles and you almost feel a sens ation of burning. The items which follow are quite open to discussion and are s imply my own personal experience. Then pass through the Tablets and try t o see some sort of landscape. My experience of this particular plane was a dull red crumbling earth. I first found myself in a Cave. As a symbol I was told that this Square of OM DI was like the roots of a tiger lily; the Square M DI O, to the right, r epresenting the Life working in"},{"pageNumber":986,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 51 it; the Square IOMD to the left, the sap flowing th rough the stalk and leaves; the Square DIOM, to the left of that, the Orange fl ower with the black spots upon it, fitly representing Air, Fire, and Earth, Yellow, Re d and Black. Afterwards I invoked the King and S ix S eniors to ex plain the general bearings of the Quadrangle. After passing through s everal fire planes, each of them of greater Whiteness and Brilliance than the last, I seemed to be stationed on a high tower situated in the centre of the Quadrangle betw een the two A's around the tower and I was told by the Six Seniors that they were pa rtly representative of the Planets, but that their Names should really be read in a cir cle, in a way we shall be taught later. At present, all I could gather was, that the Greek Cross was allotted somewhat in the way represented here, and the centre was the King. I also got an idea that the letters on the Crosses were opposed in power, positive or negative, as the case might be, to the letters in the Squares. From the Lectures circulated among the Adepts, I have gather ed that the Angels placed over the Lesser Angles of the Great Quadrangle have the following properties: Kn ittin g togeth er Fire - Centrifugal and centripetal forces. Destru ction Ex pansion and contractive, etc. Movin g f rom p lace to place. W ater - Motion, vibration, changing of forms.

G.H. FRATER D.D.C.F. These Calls or Keys which follow are only to be mad e use of with the greatest care and solemnity; especially if they be pronounced in the Angelical Language as given. Anyone profaning them by using them with an impure mind, a nd without a due knowledge of their attribution and application, shall be liable to bri ng serious spiritual and physical harm unto himself. The first Nineteen Calls or Keys, of which 18 alone are expressed, are attributed unto, and to be used with, The Tablet of Union and the Fo ur other Terrestrial Enochian Tablets. The first Key hath no number and cannot be expressed, s eeing that it is of the God-Head. And therefore it hath the number of 0 with us, though i n the Angelic Orders it is called First. Therefore, their Second Key is with us the First. U nto the Tablet of Union are attributed Six Calls, of which the First is the highest and above the other five. The remaining Twelve Calls, together with Four of those belonging unto the Tabl et of Union, are allotted unto the Four Tablets of the Elements. The First Key governeth generally, that is as a who le, the Tablet of Union. It is to be used first in all invocations of the Angels of that Tabl et but not at all in the invocations of the Angels of the other four Tablets. The Second Key is to be used as an invocation of the Angels of the Letters E.H.N.B. representing the especial governan ce of the Spirit in the Tablet of Union. It is also to precede in the second place all invocations of the Angels of that Tablet. Like the First Key it is not to be employed in the invocations of the Angels of the four other Tablets. (The Numbers such as 456 and 6739, etc. which occur in s ome of the Calls contain mysteries which are not here to be explained.) The next Four Keys or Calls are used both in the Invocations of the Angels of the Tablet of Union, and in those of the Angels of the Four Terrestrial Tablets as well. Thus: The Third Key is to be used for the invocatio n of the Angels of the letters of the line EXARP, for those of the Air Tablet as a whole, and for the Lesser Angle of this Tablet which is that of the Element itself - Air of Air. The Fourth Key is to be used for the Invocation of the Angels of the letters of the line HCOMA, for those of the Water Tablet as a whole, and for the Lesser Angle of this Tablet - Water of Water. The F ifth Key is to be used for the Invocation of the Angels of the letters of the line NANTA, for tho se of the Tablet of Earth as a whole, and for the Lesser Angle of this Tablet - Earth of Earth. T he Sixth Key is to be used for the Invocation of the Angels of the letters of the line BITOM, for th ose of the Tablet of Fire as a whole, and for the Lesser Angle of this Tablet - Fire of Fire. Thi s finishes the employment of the Keys of the Tablet of Union.

FRATER A.M.A.G. (This thesis was written in 1935 following an inten sive study of the Golden Dawn documents on the Enochian system. It has been left virtually in the same form it had at that time.) That the Enochian scheme is a vast and extensive on e is well known to the Zelator Adeptus Minor. But that it is as extensive as actually it is, is suspected I am sure by few. For the complete system of the Enochia n Tablets comprises, in reality, several apparently disconnected schemes - most of w hich are not even known to the average Z.A.M. Though they are unknown is not t o say that they are unimportant, for it requires but little perspicacit y to realize that the Enochian system underlies a large part of the important work of the Order. There are many hints to indicate that the Z.A.M. is not in full possession of all the Enochian knowledge. As the Adeptus Minor ri tual so eloquently observes of but one of the parts of the system: \"Before the Doo r of the Tomb, as symbolic Guardians, are the Elemental Tablets and the Kerubi c Emblems, even as before the mystical Gate of Eden stood the watchful Kerubi rn and the Sword of Flame. Do not therefore forget that the Tablets and the Kerub im are the Guardians of the Tomb of the A d e p t i . . . \" The whole system comprises the following segments: 1. Liber Enoch - (Liber Logaeth), these are the Enoc hian Tablets. 2. The Claves Angelicae. 3. Liber Scientiae Auxiliis et Victoriae Terrestris. 4. Sigllum Dei Aemeth. 5. Heptarchia Mystica. 6. The Round Tablet of Nalvage. The first two items above have been dealt with very adequately in the routine instructions provided for the Zelator Adeptus Minor in such documents as The Book of the Concourse of the Forces, as well as in the various introductions and digests made of that book, and also in the Ritual \" T \" known as The Book of the Forty Eight Angelical Keys or Calls. The remaining schemes are not dealt with at all in the study programme of work prescribed for the Z.A. M. In various places o f those manuscripts there are deliberate gaps, indicating that such and such an i tem of knowledge does not come within the sphere of knowledge of the Z.A.M. Nonetheless a certain amount of light can be thrown without too much difficulty upon these deliberate gaps, though wheth er or not they will be considered important depends"},{"pageNumber":1011,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 76 wh oll y on h o w mu c h of th e ord ina r y E no chi an ma t eri a l alre ad y a va ilab le ha s be en a ssi mil ate d an d ap pre ciat ed b y th e Z.

Although in this paper I propose to concern myself almost exclusively with the third of the foregoing schemes, to show its relatio n to the previous two which are summarized in the material freely circulated within the Order, a few words in description of the others may be fo un d use ful .

However, Waite in his Brothe rhood of the Rosy Cross refers to him and clears up the mystery, though in his usual sarcasti c way it seems as if he had no use for M aj or Ir wi n. ) Moreover, it must be noted that the Sigils attribut ed to the four Enochian T ablets - a Cross, a Sun with 12 Rays, and a Cross in whose a ngles are b4, 6b and a (T) with 4 Yods above it, receive their elucidation from this Sigil lum, being resolved into the names of the s o -c alle d F our Gre at Ove rs eer -An ge ls o f t hes e T abl e ts .

The schemes numbered 1-5 are very intimately relate d to the Enochian system and one to another. Item 6, the Round Table of Nalvage, however, is a magical Tablet which for the moment I have been unable to relate to the others. The communicating Angel NALVAGE dictated, in much the same way as did Ave a nd Michael in other connections, a series of letters and words which were to be arra nged in a certain manner. T hey begin ZIR MOZ IAD - Zodireh Mozod lada -\"1 am the J oy of God.\"etc. What the practical application of this Tablet is remains yet to be dis covered. It consists of four very small Tablets, each of"},{"pageNumber":1012,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 77 nine letters, in all of which the word IAD figures in four distinct permutations, surrounded by four words of five lett ers each, making 32 letters. Whether this fact connects it with the four Terrest rial Tablets and the Tablet of Union I can hardly say at this time. Of this Tablet , NALVAGE stated: \"The substance is God the Father. The circumference is G od the Son. The order and knitting together is God the Holy Ghost.\" etc. This does suggest the three columns or the cross bar and double Pillars of the Central Cross of the Tablets - Linea Spiritus Sancti, Linea Dei Patris Filiique. To refer back to Liber Scientae Auxiliis, as a prel iminary point, let it be noted that in Ritual \"T,\" the following passages oc cur: \"The application of the Keys of the 30 Aethrys does not come into the knowledge of the Z.A.M. Now although these Keys are thus to be employed to aid thee in t he Skrying of the Tablets in the Spirit Vision, and in magical working therewith, ye t shalt thou know that they be allotted unto a much higher plane than the operatio n of the Tablets in the Assiatic World. And therefore are they thus employed in brin ging the Higher Light and the All-potent Forces into action herein. And so also, they are not to be profaned, or used lightly with an impure or frivolous mind.\" In other words, it relates to the schema described in the Order manuscript entitled The Microcosm which lays down the philosop hical dictum that the Kether of Man, \"his Yechidah is his Divine Consciousness b ecause it is the only part of man which can touch the All-potent Forces. Behind Yechi dah are the Angelic and Archangelic Forces of which the Yechidah is the man ifestor. It is therefore the lower Genius or Viceroy of the Higher Genius which is beyond, and which is an Angel Mighty and Terrible. This Great Angel is the Higher Genius, beyond which are the Archangelic and Divine.\" What is to be observed from this is, that of the sa me nature as the Higher Genius are the all-potent macrocosmic forces called forth by the Keys of the Aethyrs, as shown by the fact that though 91 in num ber, which equals AMN, the latter has a gematria of 741 which reduces to 12. A nd 12 is the gematria of HUA, the great Avenging Angel, the holy and divine Geniu s in KETHER. And the invocation of these forces is to be undertaken in f ulfillment of the Obligation wherein the 5-6 initiate swore on the Cross to appl y himself to the Great Work so that, one day, he might become more than human, etc . Thus no frivolous or ignorant mind could invoke these divine forces with out bringing serious spiritual and physical harm to himself, as the Ritual \" T \" dul y and rightly warns. The second point to be noticed is that to construct the Enochian Tablets entirely with capital letters is a serious mistake. It may be useful to do so for the sake of convenience or of increased legibility. But so d oing obscures one of the several important functions of the Tablet. Certain letters thereon should appear in lower case letters and others in capitals. It is from the se latter capital letters that are constructed the names of mighty Angelical Princes w ho rule in each of the thirty Aethyrs. To each of the Aethyrs there are attribute d three Governors or Angelical Princes, with the exception of the thirtieth Aethyr named TEX, in which there are four."},{"pageNumber":1013,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 78 Thus, the Tablets enshrine, in addition to those na mes already described by The Book of the Concourse of the Forces, the names of N inety One Angelical Princes whose rule is in the T hirt y Aet h yrs o f t he Ma cro co s mic Wo rld . 9 1 eq uals the Ge mat ria of Al ep h Me m Nu n wh ic h e qua l s Ame n, a s me ntio ne d previously.

The application of Order teaching - Hebrew letters, names, geomantic symbols and sigils, Tarot cards and their Dominion in the Heavens in the appropriate colours - to the skeletal form of the Dee-Kelley sk rying expands it into a much more coherent and workable system. After all, precisely this was done by the original founders of the Order to the bare bones of the Four Elemental T ablets, which in their original form in the British Museum Manuscripts bear only the faintest r esemblance to the comprehensive and magnificent system as developed by the Order.

Zedekiel - the Angel ruling the sphere of Jupiter. Madimiel - the Angel ruling the sphere of Mars. Semeliel - the Angel ruling the sphere of Sol. There is an undoubted mistake occurring at this jun cture. If these letters and names were dictated, then Kelley must have wrongly heard and written an L where S was intended in last name. The name involved is actually Semesie l - since Semes or Shemesh is the Hebrew word for Sun. However, if one changes this letter o n the square, the effects obviously are far- reaching, for it changes also many other names obta ined by means of other modes of permutation. This I have not cared to do, beyond no ting the existence of the error. Nogahiel - the Angel ruling the sphere of Venus. Korabiel - the Angel ruling the sphere of Mercury. Here again is an error, one no doubt more of vision than of hearing, in this instance. R is recorded where K is quite evidently intended. T h e name of Mercury in Hebrew is Kokab nor Korab - therefore the angelic name should be Ko kabiel. Levanael - the Angel of the sphere of the Moon. Here clearly we have the beginning of a hierarchica l system. God names have already been given, together with symbols of planets and th e Enochian names of these spheres. Now we have Archangels and Angels, with servient hi erarchies hereafter to be noted. Referring hack to the Angelic Square again, let me demonstrate a second method of permutation.

F RATER A.P.S. T o study the rule of the GODS OF EGYPT over the sub servient squares of the ENOCHIAN T ABLET S, I have drawn two diagrams showing : On the first, the 112 squares governed by the 11 GO DS given first in order in The Book of the Concourse of the Forces. On the Second, the 144 squares ruled by the last fo ur there mentioned. (Both diagrams are now missing owing to the passage of ti me, but the enterprising student can, with close attention to the text reconstruct these drawings by himself. I.R.). In the first diagram, the squares are coloured appr opriately to the Element - ruling Powers of their respective Gods and Goddesses. Thus , squares ruled by OSIRIS are shown with an equilibriated cross of the elements in gold , traced upon them on a white ground. Squares ruled by ISIS are blue - Water Squares ruled by NEPHTHYS are black - Earth Squares ruled by HORUS are red - Fire Squares ruled by AROUERIS are yellow - Air Squares ruled by AHATHOR are olive - Water and Earth Squares ruled by SOTHIS are violet - Water an d F ire Squares ruled by HARPARCRAT are green - Water and A ir Squares ruled by AP IS are russet - Earth and Fire Squares ruled by ANUBIS are orange - Air and F ire. In the second diagram, the rule of the other four G ods is shown in a similar way; but the colour used is that of the Element unequilibria ted, in the square over which the God rules, thus: AMESHET squares are BLACK because EARTH is unequilibriated, Water, Fire, Earth. AHEPHI squares are YELLOW because AIR is unequilibr iated, Water, Fire, Air. TMOUMATHPH squares are BLUE because WATER is unequilibriated, Earth, Air, Water. KABEXNUV squares are RED because FIRE is unequilibr iated, Earth, Air, Fire. T o have shown all these squares thus coloured in th e same set of Tablets would have created considerable confusion, and have rendered i t impossible to grasp the detail in what"},{"pageNumber":1034,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 99 may be perhaps called a \"coup d'oeuil.\" The same re sult would follow had one endeavoured even to colour the 144 squares governed by the above four Gods, in tints appropriate to the mi xtur e of the Ele me nts . At a glance, what strikes the attention on looking at the first diagram, is the general harmony and balance of colour in the four angles. N ow turn the diagram through an arc of 45 0 against the Sun, and you have a map of the Element al Empire - for each quadrangle t her e nat urall y fall s t o t he p oint o f t he c o mp ass w hi ch is t he ha bit ation of its El e me nt: The Fiery Quadrangle is to the right or EAST The Airy Quadrangle is to the left or WEST The Earthy Quadrangle is to the bottom or SOUTH Th e Wat er y Qu a dr an gle is t o t he t op or NO RTH. Hence we may speak of the following lesser angles a s CARDINAL, viz: AIR OF AIR WAT ER OF WATER - F IRE OF FIRE - E ART H OF EART H; and in the Cardinal lesser a n gles d o the FOUR GRE AT GODS ho ld th eir pri me s wa y . In the WEST - AROUERIS In t he NORTH - IS IS In t he EAS T - HORUS I n th e SO UTH - NEPH THYS . In every lesser angle, there is one square that may be termed the `PRIME' Square of the Lesser Angle. This Prime Square is always the s ame in any of the four sets of lesser angles of the s a me el e ment : as AIR OF AIR-A IR OF W AT E R - A IR OF E ART H-A IR OF F IRE . It is t he ri ght ha n d up pe r s qu are i n t he wat er y a nd fi er y le sse r an gles a nd t he left h an d s qu are in t he air y an d ea rth y l ess er an gle s. This Prime Square is always ruled by the God of the Element of the Lesser Angle. Hence A ROU ERIS rules the Prime Square of the AIR lesser Angle of every quadrangle - ISIS of t he Wat er y L es se r An gl es - HORUS o f t he fo u r fier y L ess er An gl es - a n d NE P HT HYS go vern s t he Pri me S q uare of e very e art h y l e sser An gle .

It is t her efor e the F IRE o f FIRE o f th e e le me nt of th e qu ad ran gle t o whic h it bel on gs . In the Cardinal Lesser Angles, the Cardinal Gods ru le every square in both the column and the rank corresponding to the element of the Tablet. Thus, of the 16 squares, they rule no less than seven and enclose two sides of the Square. Note, too, that in each Cardinal Lesser Angle, a diagonal line of squares g overned by three Gods of the second category proceeds from the `Prime Square.' These th ree Gods are those which unite the rule of the God o f t he Pri me Sq uar e wi th th at of th e God o f t he ot her ele me nt s."},{"pageNumber":1035,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 100 There is in this a strange point worth noticing. Ta ke the West and North lesser angles and you will observe that the Element hostile to ea ch is only shown in the square opposed to and furthest from the prime square. Thus, in AIR, t he hostile element EART H is only seen in the AN U BIS square - Citrine; and in the Watery Lesser Angle, the hostile FIRE is only seen in t he viol et S OT HIS s q uar e. It i s as t ho u gh t h e AIR an d th e W AT E R, e ven when preponderating, made use of their mobility and vola tility to escape from their respective e ne mi es !

In the So uth, we see the NEPHT HYS squares en dea vo uri n g to e n velo pe ANUBIS , wh ile in t he E ast , t he s qua res o f HORUS st ri ve t o overwhelm the SOT HIS squares. It is as if these elements by their respective ponderosity and violence strove to wipe out an inim ical nature. Is not this a natural and observable tr uth ? These four Cardinal Angles alone, of the whole 16, contain no square ruled by OSIRIS. That even and equilibriated force is there nowhere to be found. Unbalanced force is at its utmost violence, and the rule of the Four Gr eat GODS is concentrated there where greatest power is needed. It is as if the Prime Squ ares of these Cardinal Angles were the sources of their respective elemental forces, whenc e they issue to continue in varying proportions one with another until they result in p roducing Osirian molecules of WATER, EARTH, FIRE, a n d AIR. Passing to the other lesser angles of the Tablets, we find various pairs and quarternions resembling one another more or less co mpletely until we find absolute identity in EARTH o f F IRE a nd F IRE of E ART H, whi ch onl y diff er in h a vi n g o p posi te sq uar es fo r t heir Prime Squares - thus making a difference of r ight and left when viewed from that spot as a p oint o f va nta ge .

Fro m this it follows that He cannot have rule in the lesser angle of any T ablet which is attributed to the Element of the Tablet it self. It also follows that He cannot have rule in any square of ARIES, for he is the Fire of Fire - nor of GEMINI which is Air of Air,"},{"pageNumber":1036,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 101 n or of S CORP IO which is Wa ter o f Wat er, no r of T AU whic h is Ea rth of E art h. But h e rules two squares in every other lesser angl e, and two squares of the other nine Signs and t hre e Ele me nts . OSIRIS further rules six squares under each Kerub; but he governs no square in the Airy T ablet under the MAN; none in the EART H Tablet under the BULL; nor in the WAT ER Tablet under the EAGLE; nor in the FIRE Table t under the LION. Similarly OSIRIS rules no square in the AIR Tablet in the ran k of Common Signs; in the WAT ER Tablet in the Ker ubi c ra n k; a nd i n t he Car din al Ran k of th e F IRE T a ble t.

In Quatern ion number 1, which consists of the Airy and Watery lesser angles, the squares seized b y the OSIRIS force are chiefly in the LION's column and in the elemental rank. That is to say, that the weakest force in the lesser angle is the one first subj ugated.

Water of Fire Vau Heh (f) with Vau having Osiris square for the E lement, and Osiris square under Heh (f) for the Common sign.

Under HEH one, and in the Kerubic Rank, one. Under VAU one, and in the Common Rank, one. Under HEH (f) three, and in the Elemental Rank, three. That is, that the fiery and earthy forces of these watery and airy lesser angles are the first to become equilibriated. Quaternion number 2 works out the exact converse of this. There, the watery and Airy forces of the fiery and earthy lesser angles are the first to be equilibriated. In Quaternion number 3, however, all this is rectified.

CHATURANGA AND SHATRANJ The present European game of chess has been gradual ly developed from the more primitive form in which it reached Western civilisa tion. It came to us from the Arabs or Saracenic races who over-ran Spain in the eighth ce ntury. These Arab races had a knowledge of the game for ma ny centuries, and they are believed to have received it from the Persians and from ancient Egypt. The game in its essentials is found to exist in descriptions by the oldest poets of India. In its oldest form traceable in literature its name is found in Sanskrit works as Chaturanga, from Chatur which is Four, and Ranga is members. Among the Saracens and Arabs, the name became Shatrangi. Introduced in Eur ope we find: In France - Echecs In Italy - Seacci In England - Chess (perhaps from Chequered board on which it is played.) In Germany - Seach. In all forms the Board used is quite similar, being Square and divided into 8 x 8 or 64 squares. The chess men too have not varied in number. 16 maj or pieces and 16 minor pieces or pawns. In the Chaturanga these 32 men were divided equally between 4 players; two partners against two, generally green and black, against red and yellow. Each player had four pieces and four pawns. Dice were cast to determine which p iece or pawn should be played. The earliest important change in the Game was the alter ation made by combining the forces of the partners. From that time, the Chaturanga out of India lost it s chatur character, and was played by two persons, each with 16 pieces and pawns. This change brought in other changes, for whereas each partner used to have a King, when the two forces were combined one King had to be converted into a Minister or Vizier, who, in later times, became the Queen. In India, the names and titles of the pieces suggest a military i deal. In Egypt the tendency was rather to look upon the pi eces as Gods of various forces or natural powers. Ancient Chaturanga. Four players, in pairs. Pieces and pawns arranged thus: King on the right, then Elephant, then a Horse, then Ship, and the Pawns were infantry. The Moves of the Element, with castle and Houdah on its back, and of the Knight, were unaltered for"},{"pageNumber":1045,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 110 ages. Castling was unknown. Pawns moved one square forward only, but took diagonally. Dice were thrown to decide moves. Dice had four sid es, marked on opposite sides with 4 and 3, or 5 and 2, making in each case 7. The Brahmins abolished the use of dice. Chaturanga is referred to in Valurika ‘s Ramayana, Book 4, Chapter 51. It is also mentioned in one of the Sanskrit Puranas, where it is said that it was invented in the second age by the wife of Rawan, King of Lanka, that is Ce ylon. The Chaturanga Elephant has become our Castle, The Chaturanga Ship has become our Bishop, The Chaturanga Horse has become our Knight, The Chaturanga King remains King. But the second King has become our Queen. The Elepha nt and Ship, Castle and Bishop have exchanged places. Perhaps the Elephant became Castle from the Houdah on its back. The ship was also formerly a chariot in some places. In the oldest Chaturanga, Dice throwing: If 2 were thrown, the player had to move the Ship. If 3 were thrown, the player had to move the Horse. If 4 were thrown, the player had to move the Elepha nt. If 5 were thrown, the player had to move the King o r Pawn. Shatranji of Persia and Araby appears to have becom e well known in Persia about 1500 A.D. We then find that the game has become a c ontest between two players and 2 of the 4 Kings have become Ministers or Queens. The early title was Mantri or Farzin or Firz, hence it is supposed comes Vierge for Queen. The Castle a nd Bishop changed places. This game is described by the Persian poet Firdansi ; a copy of his book extant is dated 1486. The Persians introduced the change of rank in a Paw n by reaching its eighth square. In the third or European epoch, the modern game of chess was developed. The players being 2 only became quite defined. It was laid down that the Queen should stand on her own colour, and that each player should have a white square at his right hand. Castl ing has been introduced, and each Pawn has been permitted to more either one or two square s at the first move. The queening of a Pawn at the 8th square has been f inally settled. The moves of the Queen and Bishop were much altered. Formerly the Que en could only move diagonally on her own colour, and the Bishop moving diagonally co uld only attack the next square but one. The Castles or Rooks were definitely placed at the extreme right and left. The present moves are:"},{"pageNumber":1046,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 111 Pawns: 1 or 2 squares forward first move, one squar e only after, take diagonally forward, and never move back. King moves one square only in any direction. Bishop diagonally on his own colour only any number of sq uares if empty, forwards or backwards. Castle or Rook moves always in straight lines, not diagon ally, and so moves over squares of both colours forwards and backwards and any distanc e if the squares are unoccupied. Queen moves in straight and diagonal lines, any distance over vacant squares, forward, or backwards, or laterally. Knight moves in any direction but always to the square wh ich may be described as two forward and one to side; or one diagonally and one forward or sideways so long as the designed place be vacant. It is immaterial whether the adjoining s quares are occupied or not. UPON THE ROSICRUCIAN RITUAL OF THE RELATION BETWEEN CHESS AND TAROT By G.H. FRATER S.R.M.D. The modern game of Chess is derived from the scheme which follows; whence its name chess, from chequers. And like Tarot, originally th e chess pieces were anciently small figures of the Egyptian Gods presenting the operation of the Divin e Forces in Nature. The chess pieces correspond to the Tarot Aces and H onours, thus, for the Chessmen, Tarot card, and Element: King - Ace - Spirit Queen - Queen - Water Knight - King - Fire Bishop - Knight - Air Rook or Castle - Knave - Earth. Pawns, the potencies of the Ace combined with each of the other forces, the servant or viceroy of that force. The pawns can only move one square at a time, and n ot two at the first move as in modern chess. The moves of the other pieces excepting the Queen are the same as those of modern chess. The move of the Queen in this scheme is unlike that of any piece in modern chess, for she controls only the 3rd square, from herself, in any direction - pe rpendicularly, horizontally, or diagonally, and can leap over any intervening piece. From which it resu lts that she can check or control only 16 out of th e 64 squares, including the one on which she"},{"pageNumber":1047,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 112 stands, and these squares to which she can move are all of her own colour. Each elemental set of pieces then consists of: King, Queen, Knight, Bisho p, Rook, and four pawns. OFFICIAL RITUAL The Correct Application of the Action of the Moveab le Images Representing the Motion of The Ruling Angels Over the Servient Squares is Call ed The Plays or Raying of the Chequers of The Tablets. Of the Chess King and the Tarot Ace. The move of this piece is one square every way, and answereth to the action of the Spirit wherever it g oeth, commencing and initiating a fresh current. Whence represented by the motion of only one square in any direction and there staying for this purpose before moving onward. So that his action is not hurried, but represents a balanced movement. Yet in his beginning of action is he at first a mut e force, and throned upon the water; as in the end of his action he is a life manifested and throned upon the earth. And herein is a mystery of the Lord Aeshoori when enthroned between Isis and Nephthys, thus representing the beginning and end of the action of him in whom end and beginning are not, bu t rather concealment and then manifestation. Herein is a great mystery of life, for His Thrones are not in the two active elements, seeing that the se are his horse and chariot of transition in the pass age from concealment unto manifestation. This piece , then, is the symbolizer of the action of the potenc ies of the crosses on the Servient Squares. Of the Chess Knight, the Tarot King. The move of this piece is three squares cornerwise every way and representeth the leaping motion of th e flickering flame. Wherefore also is he not stopped in his course by a piece or an intervening square, even as Fire seizing on a matter speedily rendereth it transparent. This piece representeth t he action of Fire as the Revealer of the strength o f the Spirit, even as Hoor is the avenger of Aeshoori . It is a force potent and terrible, the King in th e elemental operations. Thus is opened the locked doors of matter and shewe th forth the treasure hidden therein. Therefore hath all life its beginnings in a Fire Ce lestial. And the number of squares covered by the move of the King in the midst of the Board (reckoni ng from the Square on which he standeth, but not including it) is 16 squares of which 8 are checked, and 8 are passed over. Of the Chess Queen, the Tarot Queen. The move of this piece is unto every third square from her (reckoning the square whereon she standeth as the first) as well cornerwise, as well perpendicular, as horizontal. Thus again covering 1 6 squares out of a square of 25 squares, of which 8 are threatened, and 8 are passed over. But she thre ateneth not a piece upon the intervening square of her move. And her movement is as that of the waves of the sea, and (like the Knight) she is not hindered in her motion by a piece on an intervening square. This piece representeth the undulating action of water and of the sea, and she is ascribed unto the Great Goddess Isis, who is the Cherisher of Life. The Chess Bishop or Fool, the Tarot Knight. The move of this piece is any number of squares cornerwise in any direction even unto the l imits of the Tablet. He representeth the"},{"pageNumber":1048,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 113 keen and swift wind, and he is ascribed unto Arouer is the God. He is stopped by any piece in his way, even as the wind is stopped by a material barrier. He representeth the swift vehicle of the Spirit. The Chess Castle or Rook, the Tarot Knave. The move of this piece representeth the ponderous and formidable force of earth and its mot ion is any number of squares in a square direction, perpendicular or horizontal (but not cornerwise) ev en unto the limits of the boards. It is ascribed unto Nephthys the Goddess. It repres enteth the completed action of the Spirit in matter, therefore is its movement square, and also stopped by intervening pieces, yet powerful from the length and breadth of its range. The Pawns. The four pawns represent certain forces formed by t he conjunction of the Spirit with each of the four elements severally, and they are severally ascribed unto Ameshet, Ahephi, Tmoumathph, and Kabexnuv, who stand before the face of Aeshoori. And their movement is but one square forward, perpendicular, and they threaten on e square forward diagonal on each side, thus formulatmg the symbol of the Triangle, for they eac h represent a mixture of three elements under the presidency of the Spirit. Therefore, each is as it were the servant of the God or Goddess, before whom he standeth yet they be all in a manner alike in ac tion, although their Lords be different and each is the servant of the God or Goddess whose element is expressed in his symbol, without its contrary. For in each set of 3 elements, taken together, two are contrary. Wherefore Ameshet (Water, Fire, Earth) is the servant of Nephthys, whose elem ent Earth is expressed in his attribution without t he contrary of Air. Ahepi (Air, Fire, Water) equals Aroueris. Tmoumathph (Water, Air, Earth) equals Isis. Kabexnuv (Fire, Air, Water) equals Hoor. Below is a further description of the Chess pieces.

Partners. Fire, Air - Water, Earth. The First player is the Querent. The first player c hooses angle and sets the pieces in order of the Kerubic line, other players follow the first pl ayer’s setting. The corner square always has King in addition to ot her pieces. Both Kings must be checkmated. A pawn on the 8th square becomes the pi ece of which it isthe vice-regent. PTAH The Ptah used for divination - set by first player on any square in his own Lesser Angle the King to reach and remain on the square of Ptah for one round of game undisturbed and unchecked. The pieces should (if four players) be coloured Red , Black, Blue and Yellow. THE BOARDS The Four Boards of the Rosicrucian game, although d ifferent, nevertheless agree in certain particulars. In each board it is convenient to spea k of the arrangement of the Lesser Angles as an Upper and Lower Rank - Air and Water forming the Up per Rank, and Earth and Fire the Lower. It is evident that the columns of the one rank are continuous with those of the other; and in this continuity a certain regular rule is observabl e. Every column of eight squares in the Upper Rank is continued below by a column of the opposite Elem ent. Thus the Fiery columns invariably stand on the Wate ry columns below; the Watery on the Fiery; the Airy on the Earthy; and the Earthy on th e Airy. A different arrangement of the Ranks of Squares is observable, and a difference is seen in this in the Upper and Lower Tablets. In the Upper Tablets the Kerubic Rank of squares is continuous with the Elemental Rank; and the Cardinal is continuous with the common sign Ran k, whereas in the Lower Tablets the various Ranks - Kerubic, Cardinal, etc., are continuous rig ht across the boards. The diagonal lines or Bishop’s move present pecular ities. Every Lesser Angle throughout the Tablets has a diagonal line of four squares startin g from its prime square; which are allotted respectively to Aries, Gemini, Scorpio and Earth (t he non Osiris Squares). From these four squares the Bishops can move one square into a square of Li bra, Sagittarius, Taurus or Water, these completing the series of squares in that Lesser Ang le in which a Bishop can move. Let us call this the Aries System of diagonal squares. This diagonal is crossed by another which in the Ai ry and Watery boards is composed of Cancer, Leo, Virgo and Air Squares, having as subsi diaries, squares of Aquarius, Pisces, Capricorn and Fire. In the Earthy and Fiery board the second series of four form the diagonal, and the first the subsidiaries. Let us call this the Cancer series."},{"pageNumber":1051,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 116 If we now examine the Boards we shall see that the Aries system of any Lesser Angle is joined diagonally to the Aries system of the other three L esser Angles; and that the Cancer also is similarly joined to every other Cancer system. So that we hav e two systems of squares; the Aries and the Cancer; of the whole, each containing four squares allotted to every sign it contains. This resembles the black and white systems of squares of the ordin ary board; and it is as if we allotted the White to Aries, and the Black to Cancer.

The Watery and Airy Boards are counterparts of each other, so far as the arrangement of the signs, etc., of the squares are concerned. And the same is true as regards the Earth and Water Boards. Every Board has its uppermost and lowermost ranks o f the passive or female element; and its two central ranks are of the active or male element. The most striking difference between the Air and Wa ter, and the Earth and Fire boards is in the fact that in the former the ranks are broken; w hereas in the latter they are not only continuous across each board, but they are continuous right ac ross both boards when in situ.

The allied Queen, supporting the defence, has for b ase the squares corresponding to those of the Prime Player, the passive Kerubic and Elemental squares."},{"pageNumber":1055,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 120 It also falls out that no Passive Queen can, under any circumstances of Board or setting, check an active Kerubic, Cardinal; Common or Elemental sq uare in her own rank of Lesser Angles, nor a similar passive square in the other rank. It is to be seen that there are certain Signs where on the Queens are strong and others whereon they are weak. In defence the Queens, or Watery Forces of each Ele ment, are strong in the Water, Earth, Scorpio and Taurus squares of their respective doma ins. But in attacking the vulnerable points of the hostile domain depends on which Elements are in ope ration. If Water be the Prime Player, and hence the point o f attack, the Watery Queen can deliver a strong counter attack on Water, Earth, Scorpio and Taurus of yellow (being in the same rank), and on Aries, Gemini, Sagittarius and Libra of red. While the friendly Water of Earth delivers attack on Aries, Gemini, Sagittarius, and Libra of yellow and Water, Earth, Scorpio, and Taurus of Red. The Aries System then offers the strong points for the Airy portion of an Elemental Force in defence; and the Cancer System in offence. The Watery Forces of the Elements never oppose one another, nor clash in their action. Each undulates onwards unaffected by and unaffecting the undulations of the others. Each Queen will swamp opposing force only when that force encroache s on the domain of the particular Queen. Every Queen has to fear the attack of the opposing Airy forces. But as the latter develop force as the matter proceeds towards ultimation, the Quee n when protected is not likely to be destroyed by an opposing and threatening Bishop. The same is tru e as regards the hostile Knight’s attack. This rule of play is generally sound except in the case of a Queen that can check the Ptah Square; which ability greatly enhances her value. THE BISHOP The Bishops of Partners always govern the same set of squares; and the Bishops of the opposing sides govern opposite sets of squares. The se sets are the same as those before mentioned as the Aries and Cancer Systems. The Bishops of the Prime Player and his ally always govern the Cancer system; and those of the opponent always act in the Aries System. Hence if the Ptah square be of the Aries system, th e airy parts of the opposing forces have great power; but if it be of the Cancer System the opposing aerial forces are impotent in direct attac k, and can only be operative secondarily. It follows, too, that the Bishops and Queens are great opponents, since the Bishops operate over the same system as their opposing Queens. The Queens can only touch 16 squares, while the Bishop can touch 3 2, giving the latter a great superiority in this respect. But the Queen must be considered the equal of the Bishop from the power she possesses to hop over an intervening piece, which would arrest t he approach of the Bishop."},{"pageNumber":1056,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 121 And further, the Watery piece is not hampered by th e pawns in opening, whereas the Bishop as a rule cannot act at all until at least one pawn has been moved. THE KNIGHT The Knights can all reach every square on the Board s, and, therefore, operate over both the Aries and Cancer Systems. The Knight moves from one of these Systems into the other every time he is played. If he starts on a square of the Aries, his first, third a nd fifth, etc., moves will bring him on to squares of the Cancer System. And in his first, third or fifth mov es he can get to any Cancer system square on the board. His second, fourth and sixth moves will equally bri ng him to any Aries System square. There appears to be only one square on the board that req uires six moves to reach That is, if the Knight be in one of the corner squares he cannot cross the board diagonally into the opposite corner square in less than six moves.

The Earthy Board will be identical with the Fiery. It will be seen by the annexed table that the squar es of certain signs are more often attacked by the Knight than others; for instance in the firs t column it is shown that the four Sagittarius squa res in the Air and Watery Boards are attackable from no less that 24 squares: while the four Taurus squares are only attackable from 18 squares. When playing from the 16 central squares, each Knig ht governs 8 squares. These 8 squares, however, are not promiscuously arranged, but follow one rule in the Air and Watery boards, and another in the Earth and Fire. In the former the 8 squares are allotted always to 6 signs, 2 of which are moved to twice. Thus from the Earth square of the Water Tablet, the Knight moves to the following Squares: Virgo, Leo, Capricorn 2, Cancer 2, Pisces, Aquarius , duplicating Capricorn and Cancer, and missing Fire and Air of the Cancer System. Or again from the Aries square, the Knight moves to Pisces, Aquarius, Air 2, Capricorn 2, Virgo and Leo, duplicating Air and Capricorn, and m issing Fire and Cancer. But in the Earth and Fire Boards it is different. T here the Knight only moves to squares of 5 signs of its system, triplicating 1, duplicating 1, and missing three.

Their moves, like Fire pass unarrested through the other elements in irregular courses like the lamben t flame, leaping both diagonally and square-wise at every move. They contain the potential forces of th e other pieces. Their force is similar to the Tarot King, and to Chokmah. They are the ABBA forces, and with the Queens represent the Briatic forces of the scheme. The Queens or Watery forces of the Elements never c lash with one another, but ever undulate onwards each in its own course unaffected by opposi ng or crossing waves. But the Watery forces only move in their respective pre-ordained courses; they cannot leave their limits and enter upon the domain of others. Water, like Fire, is unarrested a nd undulating, and like Air and Earth it can act diagonally or square-wise containing the potential force of Air and Earth.

He is able, therefore, to reach every square on the board, and is very powerful.

THE NUMERICAL STRUCTURE OF ENOCHIAN By DAVID ALLEN HULSE 1. THE ENOCHIAN NUMBERS WITHIN THE CALLS Enochian is an isosephic language, that is a langua ge whose alphabet serves both as phonemes and numbers. The esoteric structure of the Enochian alphabet is based on phonetic sounds resembling Greek, modeled on the alphabetica l order of Hebrew and numbered digitally like Sanskrit. The language itself seems to be an amalgamation of Hebrew, Greek, English and Latin, with a sprinkling of esoteric la nguages such as Egyptian, Coptic, and Sanskrit. Above all, it is an artificial language, suggesting a grammatical structure but in reality containing no logical syntax. The number sy stem of John Dee's Enochian Language can be seen in the Golden Dawn System of 48 calls d erived from Dee's writings. The code is blinded in the sense that most use of the letters a s numbers are erroneous, but there are clues within this code to allow its decipherment. Within the 48 Calls the letters are employed as num bers sixty-three times, from which thirteen keys can be found which allow the decoding of Enochian. Eight keys clarify the correct allocation of numbers to letters. The ninth key sho ws the end or last letter of the Enochian alphabet. The tenth key details the empty or invisi ble letter in the Enochian system, corresponding to the 19th unlettered Enochian Call, the Call utilized to explore the 30 Aethyrs. The eleventh key reinforces the tenth key concerning the missing Enochian letter. The twelfth key alludes to the basic division of th e Tarot which is the model for the number of letters in the Enochian"},{"pageNumber":1064,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 129 system.

(a) letters employed as numbers in which each letter of the alphabet corresponds to a number, and (b) words employed as numeral names. The unique use of letters as numbers in these Calls is modeled directly upon the Sanskrit alphabet. The alphabets of Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, C optic, and Latin are additional; the value of any given word is the sum total of the letters comp osing that word. But with Sanskrit the alphabet becomes positional, and every letter of a word becomes the digit of a number. The Hindu mathematician Aryabhata in his work Dasagitka, published in 499 A.D., details a system of substituting numbers for letters of the Sanskrit al phabet. In this system each letter of a word is a separate digit of a number; thus a word composed of three letters would represent a number composed of three digits. This code was Ka-Ta-Pa-Ya , the most poetical and complex allocation of numbers to letters for the Sanskrit alphabet. (For a description of this number system refer to the third section of this essay.) This same method of n umerical notation is used in the 48 Enochian Calls. Of the sixty-three times numbers are mentioned in t he Calls, this digital system is used 32 times: L - 1 (Calls 4, 5, 10, 19 twice) OS - 12 (Call 3 twice) CLA - 456 (Calls 3 and 4) PD - 33 (Call 4) MAPM - 9639 (Call 5) AF - 19 (Call 5) PEOAL - 69636 (Call 5) ACAM - 7699 (Call 6)"},{"pageNumber":1066,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 131 NI - 28 (Call 7) OX - 26 (Call 8) P - 8 (Call 9) CIAL - 9996 (Call 9) OP - 22 (Call 10) DAOX - 5618 (Call 10) O - 5 (Call 11) GA - 31 (Call 11) OB - 28 (Call 12) MIAN - 3663 (Call 12) UX - 42 (Call 13) OL - 24 (Calls 10 and 14) QUAR - 1636 (Call 14) DARG - 6739 (Call 15) EMOD - 8763 (Call 16) TAXS - 7336 (Call 17) ERAN - 6332 (Call 18) The majority of the above attributions are blinded, for many values are given to one letter. For example, let us look at the use of \"A\" (the letter Un) as a number: A is 1 in AF and GA, A is 3 in ERAN, TAXS, PEOAL, and QUAR, A is 6 in CLA, MAPM, DAOX, and MIAN, A is 7 in ACAM and DARG, and A is 9 in CIAL and ACAM. The correct allocation is A as in 1 in AF and GA, t he other nine examples being blinded values. There are eight correct attributions in the 32 uses of the letters as digital numbers. These eight key s will enable us to reconstruct the proper number code for Enochian. Correctly analyzed they disclose the following information. 1) AF = 19 (Call 5) AF, which is the number 19, assigns the letter A co rrectly to 1, bringing to mind the Hebrew Aleph and the Greek Alpha. This clue discloses the beginn ing of the Enochian alphabet, not Pe (B) as Mathers premised, but rather Un (A). [Note that Un is the L atin root for One (as in UNUS, UNA, UNUM.] Although A is numbered correctly as 1, F is blinded as the number 9. Looking at every use of letters a s numbers in the Calls it is apparent that the \" 0 \" is never used. Therefore F blinded as 9, next to the correct allocation of A as 1 indicated the limit of this number code, not 1 through (1)0, but 1 throug h 9. This will be reinforced by the clue AFFA which mean s empty."},{"pageNumber":1067,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 132 2) GA = 31 (Call 11) GA as the number 31 is the only correct pair of let ters used as digital numbers appearing in 48 Calls. This allocation indicates that the alp habet is numbered in the Hellenistic-Semitic order in which G is the third position (Gamma, Gime l = 3) rather than the seventh position of the alphabet as in Latin and most European language s. The allocation of A to 1 in GA reinforces the use of A as 1 which appears in AF. 3) OS = 12 (Call 3) OS, which appears twice in the third call as 12, co rrectly allocates S to the number 2. This is highly informative for by this clue it can be seen that the Enochian letter \" S \" is modeled on the Greek Sigma, which is valued at 2 (00), rath er than the Hebrew Shin, valued at 3(00), or the Hebrew Samekh, valued at 6(0). 4) OX = 26 (Call 8) OX, which is valued at 26, correctly assigns \" X \" to 6, although \" 0 \" is blinded as 2 (resembling \" O S \" which also blinds \" 0 \" as 2). If th e Enochian alphabet is numbered as Hebrew this number position would be S as Samekh, v alued at 6(0). However since it is \"X\", this clue indicated that the phonetic model for Eno chian is Greek, where X is Xi, valued at 6(0). 5) DAOX = 5678 (Call 10) DAOX as the number series 5678, in conjunction with OS a nd OX, clarifies the numerical correspondence of O. For by DAOX, 0 is valued at 7, which is its correct value, and not 2 as in OS and OX. Therefore the model for 0 is the Greek Omicron, valued at 7(0), as well as the Hebrew Ayin also valued at 7(0). 6) UX = 42 (Call 13) UX, which is the number 42, establishes the end of the Enochian alphabet. As AF indicated the beginning point of Enochian as \"A\", UX indicates that U as 4 is the true end of the Enochian alphabet. U as 4 is modeled on the Greek U psilon valued at 4(00), which is the Hebraic position for the end of the alphabet (Tav as 400). From this clue the true model for Enochian can be seen; it is patterned on the phonetic sounds of Greek based on the Hebraic order of the alphabet. Therefore U as Upsilon, corresponding to the letter Tav of Hebrew, is the model for the end of the alphabet rather than the Greek Omega. This is f urther supported by the letter X appearing in UX. Although X is blinded as 2 (its true value bein g \" 6 \" as shown in OX), its shape as the English X suggests the rock Hebrew form for Tav as a cross. The association to U as 4 hints that U is in the position of Tav, as the last or 21st En ochian letter. Note also that Tav is assigned to the 21st Tarot Key. 7) P = 8 (Call 9) P, which is the number 8, is the only isolated lett er correctly used as a number. In conjunction with X as 6 (from OX) and 0 as 7 (from DAOX), the phonetic model of Greek is again reinforced, for X as 6 is Xi, 0 as 7 is Omicr on and P as 8 is Pi."},{"pageNumber":1068,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 133 8) OP = 22 (Call 10) OP, which is the number 22 is an example of a blinded n umber. Neither \" 0 \" nor \" P \" is valued at 2. However from DAOX as 5678, 0 is correctly numbered as 7 and from P as 8, P is correctly numbered as 8. Thus OP blinded is 22, while OP corrected is 78. There are 78 total Tarot cards of which 22 are symbolic-Qabalistic pic tures of the Hebrew alphabet. These two correspondences of 22 and 78 are the blinded and co rrect numbering of \"OP\". By suggesting the Tarot, the number series 0 through 21 is brought to mind, for the 22 cards composing the Major Arcana of the Tarot are numbered in this order. Thi s is the esoteric basis of the Enochian alphabet, 22 letters, 21 represented and 1 unwritte n. The Tarot assignment, brought out by the clues for Enochian, parallels the Enochian letter U n (A) to Key 0, The Fool and the Enochian letter Vau (U) to Key 21, The World. The missing or unwritten Enochian letter is the Greek model Theta, corresponding to Teth in Hebrew, and Key 8, Strength in the Golden Dawn Tarot. (See the comment below on the clue AFFA for further clarification of this missing unwritten letter.) In addition to the use of the alphabet as the digit s of numbers, Enochian also contains descriptive names for numbers. Within the 48 Calls the appearance of words describing number concepts occurs 31 times. They are: VIU - second (Calls 2, 4, 5, 6, 16) L - first (Calls 2 twice, 5, 15) NORZ - six (Call 3) LI - first (Call 3) LO - first (Calls 4, 8) D - third (Calls 5, 6, 7, 17) LA - first (Call 5) ULS - the ends (Call 5) S - fourth (Call 6) EM - nine (Call 6) ES - fourth (Call 7) PI - third (Call 8) OLANI - two (Call 9) OBZA - half (Call 9) EORS - hundred (Call 10) MATB - thousand (Call 10 twice) AFFA - empty (Call 19) AG L - no one (Call 19) SAGA - one (Call 19) Four major keys and one additional clue can be glea ned from these 31 descriptive terms. The four major keys are as follows:"},{"pageNumber":1069,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 134 1) ULS - the ends (Call 5) ULS, a word meaning the ends reinforces the establi shment of the Enochian U (Vau) as the end of the Enochian alphabet. For ULS begins wi th the letter U (Vau) which is the \"Omega\" of the Enochian language. From the clue UX, the model for this letter U was discovered to be the Greek Upsilon. Although its Enochian name or ti tle of Vau suggest the Hebrew Vav, the true model for the Enochian Vau is the Greek Upsilon. Th is Enochian letter U is also transliterated as V or W. However, in both the clues UX and ULS Dee chose to transliterate this letter as a U to further establish the correspondence of Upsilon. Another Enochian number name can help support this theory, and this name is VIU, meaning second, which appears in the second, fourth , fifth, sixth and sixteenth call. In this name Dee transliterates the Enochian Vau as both V and U . Symbolically the term second can be seen as that which is not first, i.e. last. Therefore th e double transliteration of Vau as V and U within the word for second suggests that the Enochian Vau is the last letter of the alphabet. 2) AFFA - empty (zero, nothing) (Call 13) AFFA appears in the 13th Call as a term for that wh ich is empty. It is composed of the clue AF (described above) written forward and backw ards. AF is numbered as 19 by Enochian, though F as 9 is a blinded attribute. However in th e light of AFFA as empty, the allocation of F to 9 in AF implies that the 9th position of the Eno chian alphabet is empty. And this 9th position in our Hellenistic-Semitic model is Theta, or Teth, valued at 9 (and assigned to the 19th path on the Tree of Life). Now in the Greek alphabet the number 5 progresses t o 7, Epsilon followed by Zeta, with the number 6 missing or empty. This 6th position is assigned to the archaic letter Stau (or Digamma) which is valued at 6. Christian tradition relates that this 6th missing letter Stau is the mark of both Qain and the Beast of Revelations. Thi s is supported by Revelation 13:18, the only instance when Stau appears in the New Testamen t as the number 6 in the number letters 666 (Chi Xi Stau). While the Enochian alphabet has a letter for 6 (F f ound in AF and AFFA), it has no corresponding letter for the 9th position of its al phabet. This missing Enochian letter corresponds to the Greek letter Theta, valued at 9. Why would Enochian have a missing letter valued at 9 and corresponding in its Greek model to the letter Theta? First, to allow 22 lette rs in all for its alphabet, permitting a correspondence to the 22 Major Keys of the Tarot. A nd second, out of respect and fear of God, honor was given to an invisible letter, correspondi ng to the unnumbered 19th Call which represents the God-head. For the angels instructed Dee that the 21 Enochian letters represent the servants of the king and not the king himself. This cor r esponds to the Jewish reverence for the Tetragrammaton, for Theta, as the empty 9th Eno chian alphabet position, represents the initial for God in Greek: ThEOS. Therefore the initial for God, Theta, can be seen a s the unsounded, unwritten and unthinkable concept within Enochian."},{"pageNumber":1070,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 135 3) EM - nine (Call 6) EM is the numeral name for nine. By the Greek phone tic order E is valued at 5 while M is valued at 4(0). Though EM is 54 as a d igital number, by addition 5 +4 =9. Nine is the missing Enochian letter correspondi ng to Theta and Teth, and nine of the Tree of Life as the letter Teth is the 19th pat h which connects the 4th and 5th Sephiroth ( 4 = M , and 5=E). 4) D - third (Calls 5, 6, 7, 17) D represents the numeral name for third. Though D i s valued at 4 in Enochian (based on Delta and Daleth), it correspond s to the third Tarot Key, The Empress. Therefore by D as third, the Enochian para llel to the Tarot is established. This is further evidence for the clue supplied by OP as 22 and 78. In addition to the above 12 keys concerning the Hel lenistic-Semitic structure of Enochian one final key concerns the blinded use of the Enochian Letter \" L \" as the number one. L appears 16 times in the 48 Calls to d esignate one: L - 1 (Calls 4, 5, 10, 19 twice) L - first (Calls 2 twice, 5, 15) LI - first (Call 3) LO - first (Calls 4, 8) LA - first (Call 5) EL - first (Call 6) AG L - no one (Call 19) L I L the call of the first Aire Though L is valued at 3 by the digital code for Eno chian (based on the Greek Lamda and the Hebrew Lamed, valued at 3(0), its bli nded value of 1 in the Calls points to various Qabalistic formulae for the numbe r 1. For in Hebrew L refers to: ( A ) L - the one law, power, might L ( A ) - not, nothing, the void (A)L(P) - Aleph, the first letter ( A ) L ( H I M ) - Elohim, the first name for God in the T orah L(ILITh) - Lilith, Adam's first mate And in Greek L refers to: L(OGOS) - the word which was sounded at the beginni ng of Creation. Therefore the use of L as one (though blinded) poin ts to the Greek and Semitic model for Enochian. Now from these 13 keys the complete number structur e of Enochian can be detailed:"},{"pageNumber":1071,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 136 1) The 21 Enochian alphabet letters must be arranged as the Greek phonetic order. 2) This arrangement must be qualified by the 22 Hebr ew letters ranging from 1 (which is Aleph, Alpha and Un) to 400 (which is Tav , Upsilon, and Vau). 3) The one place in this order of 22 which must be l eft empty is the 9th place, or place of the Greek letter Theta. 4) The number values of the Enochian alphabet based on the corresponding values of the Greek-Hebrew model must be reduced to the numbe r series 1 to 9. This is accomplished by placing the Enochian alphabet on the Qabalah of 9 c hambers (AIQ BKR), which will remove all zeros. The Enochian letters can then be used as dig its of a composite number. Thus the 21 Enochian characters are numbered as follows.: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B G D E F Z H I C L M N X O P Q R S T U The letters which are underscored are derived from the clues in the 48 Calls. Note that the word \"AIR\" from Aethyr is the first column of o ur alphabet code. A second number code for Enochian can be derived fr om the above table of correspondence. The 21 Enochian letters can also be given the number value of their corresponding Greek-Hebrew model. With this value a ny Enochian word can be given a number value by totalling the number value of the letters of any word.

This does not imply a demonic influence; rat her it is an indication that John Dee attempted to create an Angelic language patterned u pon Hebrew. The Talmud relates that the angels only speak Hebrew, while the Zohar states that when we die, there is only one angelic language we all speak. 3) One of Dee's Enochian Holy Books was titled, The Book of SOYGA. The communicating angel indicated that SOYGA is not the reversal of the Greek word (Holy). However, this is a blind. In reality this name SOYG A as a mirror of the Greek AGIOS is a clue to the true model for Enochian: Greek. 4) The Enochian Cosmology is composed of 30 Aethyr o r Aires. This is undoubtedly patterned on the 30 Aeons or Worlds of the Coptic-G nostic cosmology, which was also explored by the Renaissance Magus Giordano Bruno. 5) The name Enochian is obviously derived from the H ebrew \"Enoch,\" which literally means to initiate. The Zohar relates that Adam was given the Book of Enoch in th e Garden of Eden; but after the fall of Adam and Eve it was removed from mankind and only redeemed and brought back to earth by Enoch. Dee's own magical work was an attempt to redeem mankind again and bring this pristine Enochi an wisdom back to earth. 6) The Enochian angel Madimi communicating to John D ee through the skrying of Edward Kelley, sent on June 29, 1583, a warning to Dee concerning Kelley which was expressed in Greek characters (supposedly a tongue Kelley did not understand). Recorded beside this warning in Dee's diary is a comment from Kelley to Dee concerning this cryptic warning: \"It is the Syrian Tongue you do not understand i t . \" Now th is is the exact model for the esoteric structure of Enochian, the combination of Hellenist ic and Semitic Qabalahs. 7) John Dee numbered his own name as a transliterati on of Hebrew using the Enochian alphabet of Pantheus recorded in the Voarchadumia. This earlier Enochian alphabet may have served as a model of Dee's own Enochian sc ript; it is an angelic script based totally on Hebrew. With this Hebraic code, John Dee transforme d his name into the Hebrew IAHN DAA. IAHN for"},{"pageNumber":1073,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 138 John is valued at 66, while DAA for Dee is valued a t 6. By this code Dee was able to transform his own name into the number of the beast: 666. This is probably the reason for the vast amount of magic squares appearing in John Dee's Holy Table which ar e composed of groups of 666. (Refer to Crowley's The Equinox, Vol. I, No. 7, for an illustration of this table.) 8) The grand name given to the angelic tablets whic h contain the Enochian system of John Dee is Liber LOGAETH, or The Book of Speech from God. This Enochian name of LOGAETH is a perfect description of the dual model of Greek and Hebrew. For LOG (or LOGA) is derived from the Greek LOGOS, meaning \"the creative word,\" while AETH (or ETH) is the Hebrew AVTh, meaning \"letter of the alphabet.\" Thus LOGAETH is a symbolic name for the Greek phonetic sounds (LOGA) modeled on a Hebraic alphabetical order (AETH). II. THE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM FOR NUMBERING ENOCHIAN A second method can be used for deciphering Enochia n as numbers. This is the Golden Dawn system of allocations found in The Book of Concourse of Forces and used by Aleister Crowley in exploration of the 30 Aethyrs of the Enochian cosmo logy (recorded in his The Vision and The Voice). In Crowley's The Vision and The Voice, the Enochian for the 30 Calls of the Aethyrs is giv en Hebrew and astrological equivalents. Crowley, in co mmenting on his vision of the 29th aethyr states th at \"the geomantic correspondences of the Enochian alph abet form a sublime commentary.\" This is the Golden Dawn basis for the allocation of Hebrew to t he Enochian alphabet. In the Golden Dawn essay on Talismans and Sigils a table is given allocating 16 select Enochian lett ers to the 16 geomantic figures. These correspondences are as follows: Enochian Letter Transliteration Geomantic Figure MALS P POPULUS UR L VIA GED G FORTUNA MAJOR CEPH Z FORTUNA MINOR FAM S CONJUNCTIO MED 0 PUELLA DRUN N RUBEUS GON I,J,Y ACQUISITIO VAU U,V,W CARCER TAL M TRISTITIA DON R LAETITIA ORTH F CAUDA DRACONIS GISA T CAPUT DRACONIS PE B PUER UN A AMISSIO GRAPH E ALBUS"},{"pageNumber":1074,"pageContent":"VOLUME TEN 139 Enochian Letter Geomancy Zodiac Hebrew Letter Number Value P POPULUS Cancer Cheth 8 L VIA Water Mem 40 G FORTUNA MAJOR Leo Teth 9 Z FORTUNA Air Aleph 1 S CONJUNCTIO Virgo Yod 10 0 PUELLA Libra Lamed 30 N RUBEUS Scorpio Nun 50 I,J,Y ACQUISITIO Sagittarius Samekh 60 U,V,W CARCER Capricorn Ayin 70 M TRISTITIA Aquarius Tzaddi 90 R LAETITIA Pisces Qoph 100 F CAUDA DRACONIS Fire Shin 300 T CAPUT DRACONIS Earth Tav 400 B PUER Aries Heh 5 A AMISSIO Taurus Vav 6 E ALBUS Gemini Zain 7 Unlike the digital code concealed in the 48 Calls, the Golden Dawn parallel between Enochian and Hebrew is not phonetic in basis but ra ther elemental as defined by the attributes of geomancy. However, if the zeros in this code are removed, and this number code is then applied to the digital number codes in the Enochian Calls the following harmonies can be found: 1) CLA = (Calls 3, 4); in this number A=6 is correct, 2) MAPM = 9639 (Call 5); in this number A=6 and M=9 are cor rect, 3) ACAM = 7699 (Call 6); in this number M=9 is correct, 4) P = 8 (Call 9); this isolated number as 8 is correct, 5) OL = 24 (Calls 10, 14); in this number L=4 is cor rect, 6) MIAN = 3663 (Call 12); in this number both 1=6 an d A=6 are correct, 7) DARG = 6739 (Call 15); in this number G=9 is correct."},{"pageNumber":1075,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 140 Crowley in his use of the above Golden Dawn Enochia n Table of Attributions deviated in two main attributions. He often interch anged Leo with Cancer (both ruled by the luminaries), and Virgo with Gemini (both ruled by Mercury). The Golden Dawn system does not number the complete Enochian alphabet. In this system 5 Enochian letters are excluded. Crowle y realizing this disparity, developed 5 additional allocations based on the log ic of The Notes of the Book of the Concourse of Forces. Since the geomantic attributes for Enochian are ult imately elemental in nature Crowley premissed that the five excluded Enochian letters must correspond to the five points of the elemental pent agram. These additional five Enochian letters and their Hebrew parallels are as follows: Excluded Enochian Letter Element Hebrew Letter Number Value C(K) Fire Shin 300 D Spirit Daleth or 4 or Aleph Lamed 31 H Air Aleph 1 Q Water Mem 40 X Earth Tav 400 Thus with the addition of Crowley's five letters th e complete Enochian alphabet can be numbered in line with their Hebrew model.

THE SANSKRIT DIGITAL NUMBER CODE The Sanskrit source for the Enochian code appearing in the Calls is known as the Vedic Number Code or Ka-Ta-Pa-Ya-Dhi, (Ka, Ta, Pa, and Ya all being valued at one in this code). It is this code which serves as a key to unlocking the allocation of the 50 letters of the Sanskrit alphabet to the 50 petals of the chakra system. The rules for the Katapayadhi Number Code are as follows: 1) The 34 consonants of the Sanskrit Alphabet repres ent the numbers 0 through 9 as digits within a number. 2) The 16 vowels receive no number value or place va lue. 3) Each consonant of a word is a place value (digit) of the resultant number. 4) When two consonants are conjoined in a word the l ast consonant receives the number value. 5) The number of consonants (or conjoined consonants ) in a word determines the number of digits which compose the number value of that word. Thus all one consonant words will be valued between 0 and 9; all two consonant w ords will be valued between 10 and 99: all three consonant words will be valued between 100 an d 999, etc. The number values for the 34 consonants and the 16 vowels are as follows: THE 34 CONSONANTS Number Value Sanskrit Letter Petal of Chakra 1 Ka 1st petal - Anahata 1 Ta 11th petal - Anahata 1 Pa 9th petal - Manipuraka 1 Ya 4th petal - Svadisthana 2 Kah 2nd petal - Anahata 2 Tha 12th petal - Anahata 2 Pha 10th petal - Manipuraka 2 Ra 5th petal - Svadisthana 3 Ga 3rd petal - Anahata 3 Da 1st petal - Manipuraka 3 Ba 1st petal - Svadisthana 3 La 6th petal - Svadisthana 4 Gha 4th petal - Anahata 4 Dha 2nd petal - Manipuraka 4 Bha 2nd petal - Svadisthana 4 Va 1st petal - Muladhara 5 N . a 5th petal - Anahata 5 Na 3rd petal - Manipuraka 5 Ma 3rd petal - Svadhisthana"},{"pageNumber":1077,"pageContent":"THE COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC 142 5 Sa 2nd petal - Muladhara 6 Ca 6th petal - Anahata 6 Ta 4th petal - Manipuraka 6 Sa 3rd petal - Muladhara 7 Cha 7th petal - Anahata 7 Tha 5th petal - Manipuraka 7 Sa 4th petal - Muladhara 8 Ja 8th petal - Anahata 8 Da 6th petal - Manipuraka 8 Ha 1st petal - Ajna 9 Jha 9th petal - Anahata 9 Dha 7th petal - Manipuraka 0 (as a place value) Na 10th petal - Anahata 0 (as a place value) Na 8th petal - Manipuraka 0 (as a place value) Ksa 2nd petal - Ajna The above allocation of the 50 Sanskrit alphabet le tters to the 50 petals of the chakra system is derived from Arthur Avalon's The Serpent Power.
