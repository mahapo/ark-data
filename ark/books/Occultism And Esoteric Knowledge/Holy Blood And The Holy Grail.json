L e T r esor Ma udit b y Gerard de Sede w a s a m y ster y st or y a lightweight, entertaining ble nd of hi s t orical f a c t , genui n e m y ster y and conjecture. I t m i ght have rem a ined consigned to the post-hol ida y oblivion of all such reading had I not stum bled upon a curious and glaring om issi on in its page s . The \"a ccursed treasure' of the tit le had apparently been found in th e 1890s b y a vill age priest through the decipherm e nt of certain cr y p ti c documents unearthe d in his churc h. Although the purported te xts of two of these documents were r e pr oduced, t h e \"secret mes s ages' s a i d to be encode d within them were not. The i m pl ica t ion w a s that the dec i phered m e ssage s had aga i n been lost. And y e t, as I found, a cursor y stud y of the doc u m e nts re produced in the book reveals at leas t one conc ealed m e ssage . Surel y the author had found it. I n worki n g on his book he m u st have give n the doc u m e nts m o r e than flee ting atte ntion. He w a s bound, there f ore, to have found w h a t I had found. Moreover the m e ssage w a s exactl y the kind of t i till a t ing snippet of \"proof ' that he lps to s e ll a \"pop ' paperback. Why ha d M. de Sede not publishe d it? Durin g the en suin g m onths the oddit y of th e s t or y and th e poss i bilit y of fu rth e r dis c overies d r ew m e b a c k to it f r om tim e to tim e. Th e app e a l w a s th at of a rather m o re than usua lly intrigui ng crossword puz z l e wi t h t h e a d ded c u ri osi t y of de Sl i d e's si le nce. As I c a ught ta nta l i s ing ne w glimpses of lay e rs of m e ani n g buried within the text of the docum ents, I began to wish I could devote m o re to the m y ster y of Rennes-le C hateau t h an m e re moment s snatc h ed from m y working lif e as a w r iter for televis i on. And so, in the late autum n of 1970, I presented the s t or y as a poss i ble docum e ntary subje c t to the late P a ul J ohnstone, exec utive producer of t h e BBC ' s hist orical and archaeological s e ries \"C hronicle' . Paul saw the possibilit i es, and I w a s dispatched to F r anc e to talk to de S e de and e xplore the prospec t s for a s h ort film . During Christm a s w e ek of 1970 I m e t de Sede in Paris. At that first m eeting, I asked the ques t ion which had nag g ed at me f o r m o re than a y e a r , \"Wh y didn' t y o u publish the m e ssage hidden in the parchm ents? \"H is repl y as t ounded me. \"What m e s s age?\" I t s eem ed to m e in con c eiv a ble th a t he was unawa r e of this elem en tary m e s s age.

B y 1974 I had a m a ss of new m a terial and P a ul ass i gned Ro y D a vies to produce m y second \"Chroni c le' film , The Prie st, t h e Pa i n ter and the Devi l. A g ain th e r e action of the public proved how m u c h the story had caught the popular im agination. B u t b y now it had gr ow n so com p lex, s o f a r reaching in it s ram i fications, that I knew the de t a il ed res e arch w a s rap i dl y exce edin g the cap abilit ies of an y one person. There were too m a n y di ff erent le ads to f o llow. The m o r e I pursued one l i ne of investigation, the m o re consc i ous I becam e of the mass of m a teria l being neglecte d. I t w a s at this da unting juncture that C h a n ce, whic h had first tosse d the stor y so casuall y i n to m y la p, now m a de sure that the work would not becom e bogged down.

Thi s orde r, which has functioned under a var i et y of na m e s, is m o st f r equent l y known as the Pr ieure de Sion (\"P r i o r y of S i on' ) . 2) The Prieure de Si on has been directe d b y a sequence of G r and Masters whose nam e s are a m ong the m o st illustrious in W e s t ern histor y and cul t ure. 3) Alt hough the Knights T e m p lar w e re des t ro yed and diss olve d betw een 1307 and 1314, the P r ie ure de S i on rem a ine d unsc a the d.

Moreover, he obtaine d it when m a ny docum ents on which w e re li ed charters, deeds, proc lam a tions w e re stil l sequestered in the Vatican and unobtainable. This would seem to confir m that Hund' s s t or y of ' unknown superiors' was not a f a bric ati on.

Mo reover, a cop y of t h e Protoc ols is know n to have bee n in circulati on a s earl y as 1884 - a full thirtee n y e a r s before the B a s l e C ongress m e t. T h e 1884 c o p y of the Protocols surf aced in the ha nds of a m e m b er of a Masonic lodge th e sa m e lodge of whic h P a pus was a mem b er and s ubs equentl y G r and Master .3' Moreover, it w a s in this sam e lodge that the traditi on of O r m u s had f i rst appeared the legendary E g yptian sage who am algam a ted pagan and Christia n m y sterie s and founded the Ros e -Cro i x . M o de rn sc holars have established in f a c t tha t the P r otocols, in their published for m , are bas e d at least in part on a satiric a l work w r itten and pr i n ted in Gene va in 1864. The work w a s com posed as an attack on Napoleon I I I b y a m a n nam e d Mauric e J o l y , who w a s subsequentl y im pr isoned. Joly is said t o have been a mem b er of a Rose Croix order. Whether this is true or not, he w a s a f r iend of Victor Hugo; and Hugo, who shared Joly' s a n t i path y to N a pole on I I I , was a m e m b e r of a Rose -Croix order. I t c a n thus be proved conclusi vely tha t the P r ot oc ol s did not iss u e from the Judaic Congress a t B a sle in 1897. That being so, the obvious quest i on is whe n ce they did issue . Modern scholar s have dism issed th em as a total f o r g er y , a wholl y spur ious doc um e n t c o n c o c ted b y anti- S em itic inter e sts intent on discrediting Judais m . And y e t the Protoc ols them s e lves ar gue s t rong l y against suc h a conclusion. The y contain, f o r exam ple, a num ber of enigm a tic r e f e rences -reference s t h a t are c l e a rly not J udai c . B u t these ref e rences are so clearl y not Judaic that they cannot plausibl y have be en fabricat ed b y a forger ei t h er . No anti-Sem it ic forger wit h eve n a m odicum of inte lligence would possi bly have concocted such ref e rences in order t o discredit Judais m . F o r no on e w ould have believed th ese ref e rences to be of J udai c or igin. Thus, for inst ance, the text of the Protocols ends with a single s t atem e n t , \" S igned by the repr es enta t i v e s of Si on of the 33rd Degree. ' 3 e Why would an anti- S e m itic forger have m a de up suc h a sta t em ent ?

Nilus did not at fir s t intend it to discredit J uda is m . On the contrar y , he brought it to the cza r with the intenti on of discrediting the es oteric encla v e at t h e i m per i al co urt -the enclave of Papus, Mons ieur Phil ippe a nd ot he r s who w e re me m b er s of t h e secr et s o c i e t y in question.

When the czar spurned him , Nilus then releas e d th e Protocols in the i r doc t ored f o rm for publica t i on. They had f a iled in t h e i r prim ary objec t i ve of com p rom i si ng Papus and Monsieur P h ilippe.

Althoug h N i lus ' s ch ief targ ets h a d been Papus and Monsieur P h ilippe, he was hostile to J udaism as w e l l . 4) T h e published vers ion of the Pr otocols i s not, the r efore, a totall y f a br icated te xt. I t i s rathe r a radicall y al tered te xt. But despite the alterations cer t a i n vestiges of the or igina l version can be discerned as in a p a lim psest, o r a s in p a ss ag e s of the Bible.

It echoes the Fr ench word for ' m other' , as w e ll as both the F r e n ch and L a tin words f o r ' s e a ' . According to both t h e le a d ing Frankish chronic l er and to subsequent traditi on, Merovee w a s born of two f a thers.

I n return Clovis was g r an te d the title of \"N ovus C ons tantinus' - \"Ne w Cons t a n t in e' . I n oth e r wo rds, he was to preside over a unified em pire a \"H ol y Ro man Em pire' intended to succeed the one supposedly cr eated under Constanti n e and de s t roy e d b y the Vis i goths a nd Vandals not long before. According to one modern e x pert of the period, Cl ovi s, prior to his bapti s m , was ' f ortified .. . with visions of an em pire in succession to t h a t of R o m e , which shoul d be the inheri tance of the Mer ovingian race.\"9 According to another modern writer, \"C lovi s must now be come a kind of w e stern em peror, a patriar c h to the wes t ern Ge r m ans, reigning ove r, t hough not gover ni ng, al l peoples and kings. \" The pact betw een Clovis and the R o m a n Chur c h, in short, was one of m o m e ntous consequenc e to Christe ndom not onl y the Chris t endom of the tim e , but also the Christ endom of the ne xt m i l l ennium .

I n other words , an indissolubl e bond was established between chur c h and sta t e, e a ch pled ging allegiance to the other, each binding it self to the other in perpetuity . I n ra tificati on of this bond, in 496, Clovis allow e d him s el f to be form all y bapti s ed b y Saint R e m y at Rheim s . A t the clim a x of the cerem on y, Saint R e m y pronounced his f a m ous words: M i tis depone colla, Sicam b er, adora quod incendisti, i n c e ndi quod adorasti. (Bow th y hea d hum bly, Sica m b rian, revere what t hou has t burned and w h at thou has t revere d.) I t i s i m por t a nt to note tha t Cl ovi s's bapt i s m was not a cor o na t i on as hi s t or ians s o me t i me s s ugges t . The C hurc h did not ma ke Cl ovi s a ki ng. He was a l re ad y t h a t , a nd al l the Churc h c ould do wa s r ecogni s e him as such. B y virtue of so doing, the Church o fficially bound itse l f not to Clovis alone, but to his s u c c essors as w e ll not to a si ngle individual, but to a b l oodlin e.

Perceval does not know t h a t he i s e x pected to ask a ques t ion of this m y ste r ious object he i s expected to ask \"w hom one serves wit h it' . The question is obviousl y am biguous. If the G r ail is a ve ssel or a dish of s o m e kind, the ques tion m a y m e an \"w ho i s intended to eat f r om it' .

And it also becam e linked with Je sus. Of the numerous G r ail rom a nce s which foll ow ed Ch retien' s version, there we re three tha t proved of s p e c ia l inter e s t and relevance to us. One of th e s e, the Rom a n de I ' E s toire dou Saint G r a a l, was com posed by Robe r t de Boron, som e ti m e betw ee n 1190 and 1199. J u st ifia bl y or no, Robert is ofte n cr edited with m a kin g th e Gr ail a s p ecif i call y Christian sym b ol. Rober t him s elf stat es that h e is d r awing on an ea rlier sour ce and one quite diff erent f r om Ch retien. I n speaking of his poem , and par t icularl y of the Grail' s Christian character, he alludes t o a \"gre at book' , the se cret s of w h ich have been reve aled to him . 3 I t is t hus uncertain w h ether Robert him s elf Chris tia nised the Grail, or whether someone e l se did so b e f o r e him. Mos t au t h o r ities tod a y in c l in e towards th e se c ond of thes e possibil i ties. H o we v e r, th ere i s no que s t i on that Robe rt de B o r o n' s ac c o unt is th e f i rs t to f u rnish a histo r y of the Gr a il. Th e Gr ail, h e explains , w a s the cup of the L a st Supper. It the n passed into the hands of Jose ph of Arim athea, w ho, when Je sus w a s rem oved f r om the cross, fille d it with the Saviour' s blood and it is this sacred blood whic h conf ers on the G r ail a m a gic a l quali t y. After the Cruc if i x ion, Rober t continues, J o seph' s f a m i ly became the kee p e r s of the G r a i l. And for Robert the Grai l rom a nces involve the adve ntur es and vicis s i t udes of this particular f a m i l y . Thus Galahad is s a id to be J o seph of A r im at hea' s son. A nd the Gr a i l itse l f passes to Joseph' s brother-in- law , Br ons, who carr i es it to Engla nd and becom e s the F i sher King. As in Chretien' s po em, Perceval is the \"Son of t h e Widow L a d y ' , but he is also the gr andson of t h e Fi s h er Ki ng: Robe r t ' s version of the Grail s t or y thus deviates in a num ber of im portant respects from Chretien' s . I n both vers ions Perceval is a \"S on of the Widow L a d y ' , but in Robert' s version he is the g r andson, not the ne phew, of the Fishe r King and thus even more directly r e lated to the Gr a i l family. And whil e Chr e tie n' s narrative is vague in its chronolog y, set som e time dur i ng the A r thur i a n age, Robe rt' s is quite precise. F o r Robert, the G r ail story is set in Engl a nd, and is not contem porary with Arthur but with J o seph of A r i m athea. Ther e i s anot her Gr ai l romance which has m u c h in common with Robert' s . I n deed it would seem to d r aw upon th e s a me s o u r c e s, but its utilis ation of th es e sou r ces is v e r y d i ff erent and decidedly m o re interesting. The rom a nce in qu estion is known as the P e rl esvaus. It was com posed ar ound the sam e tim e as Robert' s poem, be twe e n 1190 and 1212, b y an author who, contrar y to the conventions of the tim e, c hose to rem a in anonym ous. It is odd th a t he shoul d have done s o, given the exa lte d s t a t us accor d ed poets, unless he w a s involved in som e calling a m ona st ic or m i lit a ry order, for exa m pl e w h ich would have render e d com posit ion of such rom a nces unsee m l y or inappropriate.

K y ot, the w e ll-known m a ster, found in Toledo, discarde d, set down in heathen w r iting, the f i rst source of thi s adventure.

Al ternatively it m i ght be des c ribe d a s a \"G nostic e xpe r i ence' , a ' m y s ti cal experience ' , ' i llum i nation' or \" union with God' . I t is poss i ble to be even m o re prec i s e and place the e x perient i al aspect of the G r ail in a very specif i c context. That conte x t i s the Cabala and Ca ba l i st ic thought. Certa i nly such thought was m u c h ' i n the air' at the tim e the Gr a i l rom a nces w e re com posed.

Ne ver t hele s s ce rta i n points m u st be m a de in order to establish the c onne c tion b e tw ee n Cab a lism and th e Grail rom a nc es. Ver y briefl y then, C a balism m i ght be descri bed as \"es o ter i c J uda i s m' - a practi c a l psychological m e thodology of unique l y Judaic origin designed to induce a dramatic tr a n sf orm a tion of conscious ness.

And though the m e a n ing a nd signi f icance of such modifications is subjec t to inte rpretation, t h e i r r e ality , as ps yc hological phenom ena, is be yond di spute. O f the \"stages' of Cabali sti c initiation, one of the m o st im portant is the stage known as Tif e ret. I n the Tif e ret exper i ence t h e i ndi vi dual i s s a i d t o pas s beyond t h e wor l d of fo r m int o t h e for m l e s s or , in cont empor ary ter m s , t o ' t ransce nd his ego' .

But in reality the G o spe l s, on w h i c h that traditi on is base d, are c onsiderabl y m o r e vague on the m a tter. Only two of the Gospe l s -Matthew and L uke sa y an y t hing at all about Jesus' s origins and birth; and they are flagrant l y at odds wit h each other. According to Matthew, for exam ple, Jesus w a s an a r istocrat, if not a rightful and legiti m a te king - d es cended f r om D a vid via Solom on. A c cording to L u ke , on the other ha nd, Jes u s' s f a m i l y , though descended f r om the hous e of D a vid, w a s of som e w h at less exalt e d s t ock; and it is on the basis of Mark' s ac count that the lege nd of the ' poor car p enter' ca m e into being. The two genealogies, in short, are so s t rikingly discordant that they might well be re fe rring to two quite diff erent indivi dua l s. The discrepancies betw ee n the G o s p els are not co nfined to the question of Jesus' s an cestry and ge neal og y.

I n Matthew ' s ve r s ion H e r o d' s persec ution of the innocents prom pts the f a mily to flee into Eg y p t, and onl y on their return do the y m a ke their hom e i n N azareth. The inform ation in each of these accounts is quite sp ecific and assuming the ce nsus did occur perf ectl y plausible. And y e t the inform ation i t self sim p l y does not agre e. This contradicti on c a nnot be rati onalised. The r e is no possible m eans whereb y th e two con f lictin g na rratives can both be correct, and ther e is no m eans wher e b y the y ca n be reconciled. Whet he r one care s to adm i t it or not, the f a ct m u s t be rec ogni s e d t h a t one or bot h of the Gos p e l s i s wrong. In t h e fa ce of s o glar ing a nd inevi t a b le a conclusi on, the Gospels cannot be rega rded as unim pugnable. H o w can they be unim pugnable w h en they impugn each ot he r ?

I n 1958, for exa m pl e, P r of es sor Morton Sm ith of Colum b ia U n iversi t y disc overed, in a monaster y near Jerusalem , a letter which contained a m i ssing fragm ent of the Go spel of Mark.

And she is prom ptly a nd angr ily rebuked b y the disciples, whom J e sus is obl iged t o si lence. I t w oul d be pl aus i ble enough for Mar y t o be sitt ing in the house when J e sus a r rives in Be thany .

In this inc i dent the beha viour of Je sus and M a r y of Be tha n y c o nf o r m s p r e c ise l y to th e tra d ition a l c o m portm ent of a Jew i sh man a n d w i f e . Ther e i s addi t i onal evi d ence for a possible m a r r iage betw een Jesus a nd Mary of B e thany . It occurs, m o re or less as a non sequit u r, in the Gospel of L uke: Now it cam e to p a ss , as th ey wen t , th at h e en te re d into a certain vill age: and a cer t a i n wom a n nam e d Ma r t h a receiv ed h im into he r hou s e . And sh e h a d a sister c a ll ed Mar y , whic h also sat at Je sus' f e et, and heard his word. But M a rtha w a s cum b er ed about much serving, and cam e to him, and said, L o rd, dost thou not care that m y sister ha t h left m e to serve alon e? bid h e r th erefo r e th at sh e h e lp me.

( L uke 10:38-42) F r om Martha' s appe al, it would seem apparent that Jesus exercises som e so rt of autho r it y ov er Mar y . M o re im porta nt s til l, however, is Jesus' s r e pl y .

As Prof essor Sm ith points out, Jesus' s career i s ver y s i m i lar to those of other magicians, hea l ers, wonder w o rkers and m i racl e-worker s of the period. 12 Throughout the F o ur Go s p els, for exam ple, he cons i s tently m eets secretly with the pe ople he i s about to heal, or speaks quietly with them alone. Afterwards he often asks them not to divulge w h at transpired. An d so f a r as the gene ral public is c o ncerne d, he s p eaks habi t u a l ly in allegories and parables. I t w oul d s eem , then, that L a zarus, during J e sus ' s sojourn at the Jordan, has e m barked on a t y pical init iation rite, leadi n g as such rites traditionally did to a sym b ol ic resurrection and rebir t h.

It would explain L a zarus' s m y steri ous disappe arance f r om the Sc r i ptural account, and his apparent abs e nce during the Crucifixion. F o r if L a zarus an d the \"belove d disc i p le' w e re one and the sam e , L a zarus w ould have been present at the Crucif ixi on. A nd it would have been to L a zarus that J e sus entrus ted the care of his m o ther. The words with which he did so m i ght well be the w o r d s of a m a n refe rri ng t o hi s brot he r- i n - l aw: When Jesus th erefo r e saw his mother, and the di s c ip le s t anding by , whom he l o ved, he saith unto his m o ther, Woman, be hold thy son! Then saith he to the disc iple . B e hold thy m o ther! And f r om that hour tha t disciple took her unt o his own home.

I f , as the \" P rieu re docum ent s ' mainta in, Edouard as sumed Sion' s G r a nd Mas t ership in 1307, he w ould have done so at the age of f i ve . This is not necessa r ily im pr obabl e, if he w a s ca pt ured on the battle f i eld at the a g e of six.
