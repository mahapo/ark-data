Wolfe This is the original introduction, used in the 1969 first edition through 1972 INTRODUCTION by Burton H. Wolfe* In the summer of 1966, a few newspapers in the Sa n Francisco Bay Area be gan to take notice of a body of Devil-worshippers headed by a former ci rcus and carnival lion handler and organist, Anton Szandor LaVey. Their practice of the black ar ts was nothing new in the world. It had traces in voodoo cults, a Hell-Fire Club that existed in 18th-Century England, a Satanic circle led by Aleister Crowley in England a century later, a nd the Black Order of Germany in the 1920’s and 1930’s. But two aspects of the San Francisco gro up made them different from their predecessors: they were blasphemously organized into a church, the First Church of Sata n, instead of the usual coven Satanism and witchcraft lore; and they carried on their black magic openly instead of underground. Wedding, baptism, and funeral ceremonies dedicated to the Devil were held in the Church of Satan, with the press invited. Rituals in the tradition of the black arts were staged at midnight in the old dark Victorian house of LaVey, an incongruous building among all the white and yellow stucco houses in the San Francisco neighborhood a short way from the cliffs along the Golden Gate. Occasionally the roar of a full-grown lion that lived in the black house with the LaVey family (Anton, 39; wife Diane, 26; and da ughters Karla, 17, and Zeena, 6) reverberated through the night, spooking the neighbors, who were already upset about living so close to Hell. Somehow it was all terribly provocative. Beside s, the Devil has always made “good copy,” as they say on the city desk. By 1967, the newspapers that were sending report ers to write about the Church of Satan extended from Sa n Francisco across the Pacific to Tokyo and across the Atlantic to Paris. When a wedding or funeral was held, with a naked woman serving as altar to Satan, the Associated Press and other wire Services were on hand to transmit the story and the scandalous photographs to thousands of periodi cals. Groups affiliated with the C hurch of Satan were organized in other parts of America and in England, France, Germany, Africa, and Australia. In existence less than a year, the Church of Satan had already proved one of its cardi nal messages: the Devil is alive highly popular with a great many people. Anton LaVey, called “The Black Pope” by some of his followers, realized that two decades ago when he was playing organ for carnival sideshows. “On Saturday night,” he recalls, “I would see men lusting after half-naked girls dancing at the carnival, and on Sunday morning when I was playing the organ for tent-show ev angelists at the other end of the carnival lo t, I would see these same men sitting in the pews with their wives an d children, asking God to forgive them and purge them of carnal desires. And the next Saturday nigh t they’d be back at the carnival or some other place of indulgence. I knew then that the Chris tian church thrives on hypocrisy, and that man’s carnal nature will out no matter how much it is pu rged or scourged by any white light religion.” Although LaVey did not realize it then—he was only eighteen —he was on his way toward formulating a religion that would se rve as the antithesis to Christia nity and its Juda ic heritage. It was an old religion, older than Christianity or Ju daism. But it had never been formalized, arranged into a body of thought and ritual. That was to be LaVey’s role in 20 th -Century civilization. All of LaVey’s background seemed to prepare h im for that role. He is the descendant of Georgian, Roumanian, and Alsatian grandparent s, including a gypsy grandma who passed on to him the legends of vampires and witches in her na tive Transylvania. As early as the age of five, LaVey was delving into Weird-Tales magazines, and books such as Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Bram Stoker’s Dracula. He felt different from other childre n, and yet he became a ringleader, glorying in the organization of mock military orders. _______________________ * Author of The Hippies and the forthcoming book, The Satanists. An article by Wolfe called “The Church That Worships Satan,” the first complete study of the modern Satanic Chur ch, appeared in the September 1968 issue of Knight magazine (Vol. 6, No. 8). Publishers Service, Inc., the producer of Knight, has graciously permitted portions of the ar ticle to appear in this introduction. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" In 1942, when he was twelve years old, LaVey’s fa scination with toy soldiers branched off to concern about the world war. He delved into milita ry manuals and discovered that arsenals for the equipment of armies and navies could be bought like groceries in a supermarket and used to conquer masses of people. The idea t ook shape in his head that contra ry to what the Bible said, the earth would not be inherited by th e meek, but by the strong and mighty. After entering High School, LaVey became somethi ng of an offbeat child prodigy. He did most of his studying outside the school, de lving into music, metaphysics, and secrets of the occult. At sixteen he became second oboist in the San Franci sco Ballet Symphony Orchestra. Bored with high school classes, he dropped out in hi s junior year, left home, and join ed the Clyde Beatty Circus as a cage boy, watering and feeding the lions and tigers. Animal trainer Beatty noticed that LaVey was comfortable working with the big cats and made him an assistant trainer. One day the circus calliope pl ayer became drunk. LaVey had taught himself to play the piano by ear and thought he could handl e the organ keyboard well enough to provide some music for the performance that evening. It turned out that he played better and knew more music than the regular player, so Beatty kept him on the calliope . He accompanied the “Human Cannonball,” Hugo Zachinni, and the Wallendas’ high wire acts, among others. When he was eighteen, LaVey left the circus an d joined a carnival. He became assistant to a magician, learned hypnosis, and studied more about the occult. This was a curious combination. On the one side, he was working in an atmosphere of life at its rawest level—of earthy music; the smell of wild animals; acts in whic h a second of missed timing mean t accident; performances that demanded youth and strength, and shed those who gr ew old like last year’s clothes; a world of physical excitement that had magi cal attractions. On the other side , he was working with the magic in the dark side of the human mind. After he married, LaVey abandoned the wondrous worl d of the carnival to se ttle into a career better suited for a home life. He enrolled as a criminology major at the City College of San Francisco. That led to his first conformist job—photographer for the San Francisco Police Department. As it worked out, that job had as mu ch to do as any other with leading him toward Satanism. “I saw the bloodiest, grimiest side of human natu re,” he recalls. “Peopl e shot by nuts, knifed by friends, little kids splatt ered in the gutter by hit and run drivers. It was disgusting and depressing. I asked myself: ‘Where is God?’ I came to detest the sanctimonious att itude of people toward violence, always saying it’s God’s will.” He quit in disgust after three years and went ba ck to playing the organ, this time in nightclubs, to earn a living while he continued his studies into his life’s fascina tion: the black arts. Once a week he held classes in ritual magic at his home. They attracted many who were, or have since become well known in the arts and sciences and business wo rld. Eventually a “Magic Circle” evolved from this group. The major purpose of the Circle was to meet fo r the performance of bl ack rituals that LaVey had discovered. He had accumulated a library of works that described the Black Mass and other pagan ceremonies conducted by groups such as the Knights Templar in 14th-Century France and the Golden Dawn in 19th-Century England. The or iginal intent of thes e black orders was to blaspheme, mock the Christian church, and address themselves to the Devil as an anthropomorphic deity that represented the revers e of God. In LaVey’s view, the De vil was much more than that. Satan represented a dark, hidden fo rce in nature that was responsib le for the workings of earthly affairs for which science and religion had no explanation and no control. “At first I detected this force in small ways,” LaVey explains. “It might be the discovery of an individual whose powers of wishing were so grea t that he could win horse races. In my case, I found I could conjure up parking pl aces at the last minute in front of theaters, when none should have been there. I also discovere d an ability through magic to bri ng reversals to enemies and gain advantage for myself. I realized I had stumbled onto something, and I would have gone on doing it on my own without any Magic Circle . But I also realized that for some things private magic was weaker than mass ritual magic.” Hence, on the last night of April 1966 —Walpurgisnacht, the most important festival in the lore of magic and witchcraft—LaVey shaved his head in the tradition of ancient strongmen and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"announced the formation of the Church of Satan. Fo r proper identification as its minister, he put on the clerical collar. Up to that collar, he almost looked holy. But the Genghis Khan shaved head, his Mephistophelian beard, and his narrow eyes ga ve him the necessary demonic look for his priesthood of the Devil’s church. “For one thing,” LaVey explains, “calling it a ch urch enabled me to follow the magic formula of nine parts outrage to one part social respectability that is needed for success. But the main purpose was to gather a group of like-minded indivi duals together for the use of their combined energies in calling up the dark for ce in nature that is called Satan.” As LaVey correctly perceived, all other churches are based on worship of the spirit and denial of the flesh. He saw the need for a church that would recapture man’s body and carnal desires as objects of celebration. “And,” he adds, “since worshi p of fleshly things produces pleasure, there would then be a temple of glorious indulgence that would be fun for people. All the other churches are places of abstinence with services that people wa nt to have over as soon as possible so they can get out and start en joying life again.” In the Church of Satan, LaVey initiated clever psychodramas that would enable a group of flesh-worshippers to overcome the repressions an d inhibitions fostered by the Judaeo-Christian tradition. He knew that the old concept of a Bl ack Mass to satirize Christian services was outmoded. There was a revolution in the Chris tian church itself against orthodox rites and traditions. It was popular to declare that “God is dead.” So, the rites that he worked out, while still maintaining the trappings of the ancient Black Ma ss, were changed from a negative mockery to positive forms of celebrations: Satanic weddings, funerals devoid of sanctimonious platitudes, lust rituals to help individuals attain their sex desires, destruction r ituals to enable members of the Satanic Church to triumph over enemies and win their goals in life. There is no altruism or love-thy- neighbor concept in the Satanic religion, except in the sense of helping other adherents of the Black Path to gain their desires by gr oup energy. Satanism is a blatantly selfish, brutal religion. It is based on the belief that man is inherently a selfish, violent creature, that life is a Darwinian struggle for surviv al of the fittest, that the earth will be ruled by those who fight to win the ceasele ss competition that exists in all jungles—including that of urban societies. On that score, the Church of Satan ma y be justly criticized, although even its critics will have to admit that its philosophy is based on logi c and real conditions that exist in the world. On the other hand, the great contribution to civili zed thought made by the Church of Satan is its celebration of the complete human being instead of the spirit alone. The signs are everywhere that humanity is striving to burst the restrictive bonds of religion. It was predicted in the Bible, for that matter, in symbolic passages th at dealt with Satan chained for a thousand years, after which he would break free and foment deviltry on the earth. Now it is happening. Sex is exploding in movies and literature, on the streets, a nd in the home. People are danci ng topless and bottomless. Youths are throwing off restrictions that deny pleasur e in mind and body. There is a ceaseless quest for entertainment, gourmet foods and wines, adventure, enjoyment of the here and now. Man is no longer willing to wait for any after life that promises to reward th e clean, pure—translate: ascetic, drab—spirit. There is a mood of neo-paganism and hedonism, and from it have emerged a wide variety of intelligent individuals—doctors, lawy ers, engineers, teachers, writers, actors, stockbrokers, clerks, printers, nurs es (to cite just a few categorie s of Satanic Church members)— who are interested in carrying the liberation of the flesh all the way to a formal religion. In the Satanic Bible, Anton LaVey explains the philosophy of Satanism better than any of his ancestors in the Kingdom of Darkne ss, and describes the various r ituals and trappings that have been devised to create a true church of flesh-worshippers. It is clear, from the interest in Satanism that erupted in 1968 along with the fasc ination directed toward Ira Levin’s book Rosemary’s Baby, that there are many people who w ould like to know how to start Sa tanic cults and ritualize black magic. This book shows them how to go about it and f ills that need. It is also clear that there is a place for the formulation of teachings that constitute the antithesis to the repressive, inhibiting, anti- material dogma of Christianity and other antiquated religions. The Satanic Bible also fills that need. Perhaps the most important social value of this book is its challenge to other religions: Deal with carnal desire and the flesh in a logical, rational manner or lose the struggle not only for men’s bodies, but also their souls. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION by Michael A. Aquino This introduction appeared in the hardcover Sat anic Bible from its first release in 1972 throughout its existence, and in the Av on paperback edition from 1972 to 1976 Each successive era of man’s cultural and et hical development has upraised its literary manifesto - an argument challenging existing norms and proposing a novel approach to the enduring issues of civilization. It has not infrequently been the cas e that the realit ies of political nationalism have been blended with the idealisms of extranational emphasis to produce what we now cautiously term existentialism. Pertinent wo rks might include the Republic of Plato, the Politics of Aristotle, Machiavelli’s Prince , and the writings of Nietzs che, Hobbes, Locke, Marx, and Sartre. This is the book of our era. The dawn of the Satanic Age was celebrated on April 30, 1966 - the Year One. On that date Anton Szandor LaVey consecrated the Church of Sa tan in the city of San Francisco and assumed office as its first High Priest. What had begun se veral years earlier as an intellectual forum dedicated to the investigation and application of the Black Ar ts has since expanded into an international philosophical moveme nt of the first magnitude. Satani sm, once the isolate province of furtive outcasts and radical eccentrics, has now b ecome a serious alternativ e to the doctrines of theism and materialism. In its championship of indulgence instead of abs tinence, the Church of Satan rejects the notion that man’s progress is co ntingent upon his acceptance of a self-imposed morality. Sound judgment derives from the compar ison and resolution of opposites, Satanists maintain, and one cannot presume to justice by honoring a single sta ndard of behavior. An empirical approach to morality is not a re cent innovation; such theorists as Pythagoras, Hegel, Spencer, and Compte advanced the or iginal propositions fo r man’s intellectual independence from the natural or der. And, though this concept ha s invariably provoked adverse reaction from society-oriented in stitutions, it is not an insubs tantial viewpoint. One need only consider the spasmodic cataclysms of history to see how inadequately Homo sapiens cooperates with his fellows. By itself, however, all theory is inconsequent ial. Until now the only advocates of a subjective morality were professorial abstractionists and -occasionally -the scattered and disorganized devotees of the traditional “White” witchcraft. Ind eed the latter have enjoyed some notoriety of late, as their supposed proclamation of a liberal morality tempered by social correctness appeals to the bored but timid dilettante. Such aficionados of the occult profess a ri ghteous horror of Black Magic or Satanism, which they denounce as a malefi cent, degenerate creature of moral and carnal abuse. The Satanist, on the other hand, regards traditiona l witchcraft as merely a neurotic reaction against the established religions of the parent culture. The worshi p of any deity or deities - under any guise whatsoever - is repulsive to the Black Magician, who cons iders all protestations of faith or trust in a supernatural protectorate to be humiliating demonstrations of cowardice and emotional insecurity. Satanism has been frequently misrep resented as “devil worship”, when in fact it constitutes a clear rejecti on of all forms of worship as a desirabl e component of the personality. It is not so much an anti-religion - a simple rebuttal of any one belief - as it is an un-religion, an uncompromising dismissal of all insubstantial mystic ism. As such it represents a far more serious threat to organized theologies than do th e archaic customs of the old dæmonologies. Ritual and fantasy play a very real part in the activities of the Satanic Church, on the assumption that the experience and control of me ntal and metaphysical irrationality are necessary for the strengthening of the psyche. Thus a distinct effort is made to avoid what was perhaps the Achilles’ heel of the Gurdjieff-Ouspensky school of subjective psychological evolution; earlier disciples of self-determined trans cendentalism postulated that all non-materialistic sensations were a danger to the coherence of the stud ent. Crucial to the concept of Satanic ritual is an appreciation of its illustrative and inspirationa l qualities without necessarily regarding it as inflexible reality. Satanism is more accurately identified as a disposition than as a religion, as it is actively concerned with all the facets of human existence, not with only the so-calle d spiritual aspects. Yet"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"those who proclaim it to be a danger to justice and cooperative order have missed the point entirely. Satanism advocates unrestricted freedom, but onl y to the extent that one’s preferences do not impinge upon another’s. It should al so be noted that Satanism is a philosophy of the individual, not of the mass. There are no collective policy statem ents save the famous Crowley admonition: “Self- deceit is the gravest of all ‘sins’.” While the majority of the populace may instinctivel y incline to a de facto Satanism, the Church cautions that its propositions are not for the irresponsible. There ar e no Satanic missionaries, and to affiliate one must meet exacting standards. In experience is not dishonored, but pretentiousness, hypocrisy, and pomposity are treated with the scorn that they deserve. Satanism is no less an art than it is a science, and there is “ no standard of measurement deified”. Dr. LaVey is uniquely prepared to author th e new Diabolism. An American of Georgian, Alsatian, and Romanian Gypsy descent, he was quic k to display the characteristic restlessness of his nomadic ancestors and an unusual empathy for their earthy, arcane lore. An early preoccupation with the military sciences led him to read the various logistical publicat ions of the World War II era, only to discover that the pr oud visions of martial glory entert ained in the first world war had given way to a detached, mercenar y realism in the second. His experi ences as a student did nothing to dispel this first taste of human cynicism, and LaVey’s growing impa tience with the sterile regimentation of conventional educat ion drove him to seek the strang e, surrealistic en chantments of the circus. He assisted Clyde Beatty as a wild -animal trainer, and he soon developed a strong affinity for the cats which was to mark his pers onality in a most curious manner. All animate creatures are basically bestial, he reasoned, and even the most refine d social orders achieve at best only a flimsy suppression of this innate savagery. From the circus he proceeded to a carnival, where the glitter of the performing arts was tinged with the ever-present struggle for daily subsistence. Here LaVey worked in a pathetic but quietly di gnified world of misfits, sideshow freaks, and human oddities; and here he was to learn the craft of the stage magician, whose success depends upon the contrived distraction of the audience’s attention. With a certain grimness he noted the fascination with which the “normal” man regards his deformed comrades - a gloating satisfaction over the visiting of misfortune upon another instead of oneself. Becoming increa singly interested in this cruel, lycanthropic attribute of human nature, he studied crim inology in college and eventually worked with the San Francisco Police Department as a photographer. As a circus professional he had seen carnal man at his most artistic; now he was to view him at his most vicious. Three years of the gore, brutalit y, and abject misery that permeate the criminal subculture left him sickened, disillusioned, a nd angered with the rampant hypocrisy of polite society. He turned to the pipe or gan as a means of living and devoted the greater part of his efforts to what was to become his life’s work - Black Magic. LaVey had long since rejected the stereotypical tracts on ceremonial sorc ery as the hysterical products of medieval imaginations . The “Old Craft” with its supe rstitions, affected mannerisms, and infantile parlor games was not for him; wh at he sought was a metaphysical psychology that would approach the intellectual ma n only after giving due considera tion to his brutal, animalistic origins. And so he came at last to the Goat of Mendes. Satan is easily the most enigmatic figure in clas sical literature. Possessed of every conceivable wealth, and the most powerful of the Archangels, he spurned his exalted allegiance to proclaim his independence from all that his Heavenly patr on personified. Although condemned to the most hideous of domains, a Hell totally shunned by the divinity, he embraced such privations as the burden of his intellectual prerogativ e. In his Infernal Empire one might indulge even the most extraordinary tastes with impunity, yet amidst su ch wanton licentiousness the Devil maintained a peculiar nobility. It was this elusive qualit y which Anton LaVey determined to identify. After long years of research and experiment, he pronounced the guiding principle of Satanism: that the ultimate consequence of ma n lies not in unity but in duality. It is only synthe sis that decides values; adherence to a singl e order is arbitrary and therefore insignificant. LaVey’s disturbing theories a nd bizarre operations of ceremoni al Black Magic eventually attracted a following of similarly minded individuals. From this first small circle the Church of Satan was to emerge, attuned to its founder’s cont ention that its messages would be presented most effectively through “nine parts soci al respectability to one part of the most blatant outrage”."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The social impact and spectacular growth of the Church were to become something of a legend in themselves, but it was an essent ial part of LaVey’s convictions th at the formal institution’s role was principally that of a catal yst. Contemporary civilization ha s proved too interdependent to permit the luxury of monastic isolationism. Satanism must accordingly assume a stance comprehensible to the average intellect . It was with such intent that the Satanic Bible was conceived. The Satanic Bible is a most insidious document. One is strongly tempted to compare it with that obscure, malefic mythology The King in Yellow , a psychopolitical work th at supposedly drove its readers to madness and damnation. As candid and conversational as the Satanic Bible might seem at first glance, it is not a volume to be gently dismissed. It is very much the product of our time, not only because such a book -together with its author -would more than likely have been destroyed in an earlier era, but because its creation was an evolutionary inevitability. You, the reader, are about to be impaled upon th e sharp horns of a Satanic dilemma. If you accept the propositions of this book, you condemn your mo st cherished sanctuaries to annihilation. In return you will awaken - but only to the most fiery of Hells. Should you reject the argument, you resign yourself to a cancerous disintegration of your previously subconscious sense of identity. Small wonder that the Archfiend’s legacy has won him so many bitter enemies! Whatever your decision, it can be avoided no longer. The Satanic Bible finally articulates what man has instinctively dreaded to proclaim: that he himself is potentially divine. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION by Burton H. Wolfe This second introduction by Wolfe was used from 1976 through 2005 On a winter’s evening in 1967, I drove crosstown in San Fran cisco to hear Anton Szandor LaVey lecture at an open meeting of the Sexua l Freedom League. I was attracted by newspaper articles describing him as “the Black Pope” of a Satanic church in which baptism, wedding, and funeral ceremonies were dedicated to the Devil. I was a free-la nce magazine writer, and I felt there might be a story in LaVey and his contemporar y pagans; for the Devil has always made “good copy,” as they say on the city desk. It was not the practice of the blac k arts itself that I considered to be the story, because that is nothing new in the world. There were Devil-wo rshipping sects and voodoo cults before there were Christians. In eighteenth-century England a Hell-Fire Club, with connections to the American colonies through Benjamin Franklin, gained some brief notoriety. During the early part of the twentieth century, the press publiciz ed Aleister Crowley as the “wic kedest man in the world.” And there were hints in the 1920s and ‘30s of a “black order” in Germany. To this seemingly old story La Vey and his organization of contemporary Faustians offered two strikingly new chapters. First, th ey blasphemously represented them selves as a “church,” a term previously confined to the branches of Christianit y, instead of the traditional coven of Satanism and witchcraft lore. Second, they practiced thei r black magic openly in stead of underground. Rather than arrange a preliminary interview with LaVey for discussion of his heretical innovations, my usual first step in research, I decided to watch and listen to him as an unidentified member of an audience. He was described in some newspapers as a former circus and carnival lion tamer and trickster now representing himself as the Devil’s representative on earth, and I wanted to determine first whether he was a true Satanist, a prankster, or a quack. I had already met people in the limelight of the occult business; in fact, Jeane Dixon was my landlady and I had a chance to write about her before Ruth Montgomery did. Bu t I had considered all the occultists phonies, hypocrites, or quacks, and I would never spend fi ve minutes writing about their various forms of hocus-pocus. All the occultists I had met or heard of were white-lighters: alleged seers, prophesiers, and witches wrapping their supposedly mystic pow ers around God-based, spiritual communication. LaVey, seeming to laugh at them if not spit on them in contempt, emerged from between the lines of newspaper stories as a black magician basing his work on the dark side of nature and the carnal side of humanity. There seemed to be nothing spiritual about his “church”. As I listened to LaVey talk that first time, I realized at once there was nothing to connect him with the occult business. He could not even be desc ribed as metaphysical. The brutally frank talk he delivered was pragmatic, relativisti c, and above all rational. It wa s unorthodox, to be sure: a blast at established religious worship, repr ession of humanity’s carnal nature , phony pretense at piety in the course of an existence based on dog-eat-dog material pursuits. It was also full of sardonic satire on human folly. But most important of all, the talk was logical. It was not quack magic that LaVey offered his audience. It wa s common sense philosophy based on the realities of life. After I became convinced of LaVey’s sincerity, I had to convince him that I intended to do some serious research instead of adding to the accumulation of hack articles dealing with the Church of Satan as a new type of freak show . I boned up on Satanism, di scussed its history and rationale with LaVey, and attended some midnight rituals in the fa mous Victorian manse once used as Church of Satan headquarters. Out of all that I produced a serious article, only to find that was not what the publishers of “respectable” magazines wanted. They were interested in only the freak show kind of article. Finally, it was a so -called “girlie” or “man’s” magazine, Knight of September 1968, that published the first definitive articl e on LaVey, the Church of Satan, and LaVey’s synthesis of the old Devil legend s and black magic lore into the modern philosophy and practice of Satanism that all followers and imitators now use as their model, their guide, and even their Bible. My magazine article was the beginning, not the end (as it has been with my other writing subjects), of a long and intimate associat ion. Out of it came my biography of LaVey, The Devil’s Avenger, published by Pyramid in 1974. After the book was published, I became a card-carrying member and, subsequently, a priest of the Church of Satan, a title I now proudly share with many"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"celebrated persons. The postmidnight philosophi cal discussions I began with LaVey in 1967 continue today, a decade later, supplemented someti mes these days by a nifty witch or some of our own music, him on organ and me on drums, in a bizarre cabaret popu lated by superrealistic humanoids of LaVey’s creation. All of LaVey’s background seemed to prepare him for his role. He is the descendant of Georgian, Roumanian, and Alsatian grandparents, including a gypsy grandm other who passed on to him the legends of vampires and witches in her na tive Transylvania. As early as the age of five, LaVey was reading Weird-Tales magazines and books such as Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein and Bram Stoker’s Dracula . Though he was different from other ch ildren, they appointed him as leader in marches and maneuvers in mock military orders.

He delved into military manuals and disc overed arsenals for the equipment of armies and navies could be bought like groceries in a superm arket and used to conquer nations. The idea took shape in his head that contrary to what the Christ ian Bible said, the earth w ould not be inherited by the meek, but by the mighty. In high school LaVey became something of an offbeat child prodigy. Reserving his most serious studies for outside the schoo l, he delved into music, metaphysics, and secrets of the occult. At fifteen, he became second oboist in the San Fr ancisco Ballet Symphony Orchestra. Bored with high school classes, LaVey dropped out in his Junior year, left home , and joined the Clyde Beatty Circus as a cage boy, watering and feeding the lions and tigers. Anim al trainer Beatty noticed that LaVey was comfortable working with the big ca ts and made him an assistant trainer. Possessed since childhood by a passion for the arts , for culture, LaVey was not content merely with the excitement of training jungle beasts and working with th em in the ring as a fill-in for Beatty. By age ten he had taught himself to play the piano by ear. This ca me in handy when the circus calliope player became drunk before a performance and was unable to go on; LaVey volunteered to replace him, confident he coul d handle the unfamiliar organ keyboard well enough to provide the necessary background music. It turn ed out he knew more music and played better than the regular calliopist, so B eatty cashiered the drunk and insta lled LaVey at the instrument. He accompanied the “Human Cannonball”, Hugo Zachi nni, and the Wallendas’ high-wire acts, among others. When LaVey was eighteen he left the circus and jo ined a carnival. There he became assistant to a magician, learned hypnosis, and studied more about the occult. It was a curious combination. On the one side he was working in an atmosphere of lif e at its rawest level - of earthy music; the smell of wild animals and sawdust; acts in which a second of missed tim ing meant accident or death; performances that demanded youth and strength, and shed those who grew old like last year’s clothes; a world of physical excitement that ha d magical attractions. On the other side, he was working with magic in the dark side of th e human brain. Perhaps the strange combination influenced the way he began to view humanity as he played organ for carnival sideshows. “On Saturday night,” LaVey recalled in one of our long talks, “I would see men lusting after half-naked girls dancing at the carnival, and on Sunday morning when I was playing organ for tent- show evangelists at the other end of the carnival lot, I would see these same men sitting in the pews with their wives and children, asking God to forg ive them and purge them of carnal desires. And the next Saturday night they’d be back at the carnival or some other place of indulgence. I knew then that the Christian church thrives on hypocrisy, and that man’s carnal na ture will out no matter how much it is purged or scourged by any white-light religion.” Though LaVey did not realize it th en, he was on his way toward formulating a religion that would serve as the an tithesis of Christia nity and its Judaic heritage. It was an old religion, older than Christianity or Judaism. But it had never be en formalized, arranged into a body of thought and ritual. That was to become LaVey’s role in twentieth-century civilization. After LaVey became a married man himself in 1951, at age twenty-one, he abandoned the wondrous world of the carnival to settle into a career better suited for homemaking. He had been enrolled as a criminology major at the City Co llege of San Francisco. That led to his first conformist job, photographer for the San Francisco Police Department. As it worked out, that job had as much to do as any other with his de velopment of Satanism as a way of life. “I saw the bloodiest, grimiest side of human na ture,” LaVey recounted in a session dealing with"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"his past life. “People shot by nut s, knifed by their friends; little ki ds splattered in the gutter by hit- and-run drivers. It was disgusting and depressing. I asked myself: ‘Where is God?’ I came to detest the sanctimonious attitude of people toward vi olence, always saying ‘it’s God’s will’.” So he quit in disgust after three years of be ing a crime photographer and returned to playing organ, this time in nightclubs and theaters to earn a living while he contin ued his studies into his life’s passion: the black arts. Once a week he held classes on arcane t opics: hauntings, E.S.P., dreams, vampires, werewolves, divination, ceremonial magic, etc. They attracted many people who were, or have since become, well known in th e arts and sciences, and the business world. Eventually a “Magic Circle” evolved from this group. The major purpose of the Circle was to meet fo r the performance of magical rituals LaVey had discovered or devised. He had accumulated a library of works that described the Black Mass and other infamous ceremonies conducted by groups such as the Knights Templar in fourteenth-century France, the Hell-Fire club and the Golden Dawn in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England. The intent of some of these se cret orders was to blaspheme, lampoon the Christian church, and address themselves to the Devil as an anthropomor phic deity that represente d the reverse of God. In LaVey’s view, the Devil was not that, but rather a dark, hidden force in nature responsible for the workings of earthly affairs, a force for which neither science nor reli gion had any explanation. LaVey’s Satan is “the spirit of progress, the insp irer of all great movement s that contribute to the development of civilization and th e advancement of mankind. He is th e spirit of revolt that leads to freedom, the embodiment of all heresies that liberate.” On the last night of April 1966– Walpurgisnacht, the most important festival in the lore of magic and witchcraft–LaVey ritualistically shaved his head in accordance with magical tradition and announced the formation of the Church of Sata n. For proper identification as its minister, he put on the clerical collar. Up to that collar he looked almo st holy. But his Genghis Khan-like shaven head, his Mephistophelian beard, and his na rrow eyes gave him the necessary demonic look for his priesthood of the De vil’s church on earth. “For one thing,” LaVey explained himself, “calling it a church enabled me to follow the magic formula of one part outrage to nine parts social respectability that is n eeded for success. But the main purpose was to gather a group of like-minde d individuals together for the use of their combined energies in calling up the dark fo rce in nature that is called Satan.” As LaVey pointed out, all other churches are ba sed on worship of the spirit and denial of the flesh and the intellect. He saw the need for a c hurch that would recaptu re man’s mind and carnal desires as objects of celebrati on. Rational self-interest would be encouraged and a healthy ego championed. He began to realize that the old concept of a Black Mass to satirize Christian services was outmoded or, as he put it, “beati ng a dead horse”. In the Church of Satan, LaVey initiated some exhilarating psychodramas, in lieu of Christiani ty’s self-debasing serv ices, thereby exorcising repressions and inhibitions fostered by white-light religions. There was a revolution in the Chri stian church itself against ort hodox rites and traditions. It had become popular to declare that “God is dead”. So, the alternative rites that LaVey worked out, while still maintaining some of the trappings of ancient ceremonies, were changed from a negative mockery to positive forms of celebrations and purges: Satanic weddings consecrating the joys of the flesh, funerals devoid of sanctimonious platitudes, lust rituals to help individuals attain their sex desires, destruction rituals to enable members of the Satanic c hurch to triumph over enemies. On special occasions such as baptisms, weddings, and funerals in the name of the Devil, press coverage, though unsolicited, was phenomenal. By 1967 the newspapers that were sending reporters to write about the Church of Satan ex tended from San Francisco across the Pacific to Tokyo and across the Atlantic to Paris. A photo of a nude woman, half covered by a leopard skin, serving as an altar to Satan in a LaVey- conceived wedding ceremony, was transmitted by major wire services to daily newspape rs everywhere: and it s howed up on the front page of such bulwarks of the media as the Los Angeles Times . As the result of the publicit y, grottos (LaVey’s counterpart to covens) affiliated with the Church of Satan spread throughout the world, proving one of LaVey’s cardinal messages: the Devil is alive and hi ghly popular with a great many people. Of course LaVey pointed out to anyone who would listen that the Devil to him and his followers was not the stereotyped fellow cloaked in red garb, with horns, tail and pitchfork, but"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"rather the dark forces in nature that human be ings are just beginning to fathom. How did LaVey square that explanation with his own appearance at times in black cowl with horns? He replied: “People need ritual, with symbols such as those you find in baseball games or church services or wars, as vehicles for expending emotions they can’t release or even understand on their own.” Nevertheless, LaVey himself soon tired of the games. There were setbacks. First, some of LaVey’s neighbors began complaining about the full-grown lion he was keeping as a house pet, and eventually the big cat was donated to the local zoo. Next, one of LaVey’s most devoted witches, Jayne Ma nsfield, died under a curse he had placed on the head of her suitor, lawyer Sam Brody, for a variety of reasons I have explained in The Devil’s Avenger; LaVey had persistently warned her away fr om Brody and felt depressed over her death. It was the second tragic death in the sixties of a Hollywood sex symbol with whom he had been intimately involved; the other wa s Marilyn Monroe, LaVey’s paramour for a brief but crucial period in 1948 when he had quit the carnival and was playing organ for strippers around the Los Angeles area. On top of all that, LaVey was tired of organi zing entertainments and purges for his church members. He had gotten in touch with the last livi ng remnants of the prewar occult fraternities of Europe, was busily acquiring their ph ilosophies and secret rituals left over from the pre-Hitler era, and needed time to study, write and work out new principles. He had long been experimenting with and applying the principles of geometric spatia l concepts in what he terms “The Law of the Trapezoid”. (He scoffs at current faddists who are “barking up the wrong pyramids”.) He was also becoming widely sought as speaker, guest on radio and television programs, and production and/or technical adviser to scores of television producers and moviemakers turning out Satanic chillers. Sometimes he was also an actor. As sociologist Clinton R. Sanders points out: “...no occultist has had as direct an impact upon formulaic cinematic presentations of Satanism as has Anton Szandor LaVey. Ritual and esoteric symbolism are central elements in LaVey’s church and the films in which he has had a hand contain detailed portrayals of Satanic rites and are filled with traditional occult symbols. The emphasis upon ritu al in the Church of Satan is ‘intended to focus the emotional powers within each individual’. Sim ilarly, the ornate ritualism that is central to LaVey’s films may reasonably be seen as a mechanism to involve an d focus the emotional experience of the cinema audience.” At last LaVey decided to transf er rituals and other organized activities to Church of Satan grottos around the world, and devote himself to writ ing, lecturing, teaching - and to his family: wife Diane, the blonde beauty who serves as High Priest ess of the Church; raven- haired daughter Karla, now in her early twenties, a crim inology major like her father be fore, spending much of her time lecturing on Satanism at universit ies in many parts of the country; and finally Zeena, remembered by people who saw the famous photo of the Satani c Church baptism as a tiny tot, but now a gorgeously developed teenager attracting a growing pack of wolves, human male variety. Out of LaVey’s relatively quiescent period ca me his widely read, pioneering books: First, The Satanic Bible, which at this writing is in its twelft h edition (and this is my second, revised introduction, after having written the origin al introduction to the fi rst edition). Second, The Satanic Rituals, which covers more of the somber, complex material LaVey unearthed from his increasing sources. And third, The Compleat Witch, a bestseller in Italy, but, sadly, allowed by its American publisher to go out of print with its potential unfulfilled. LaVey’s spreading out from organized church activities to writing books for worldwide distribution has, of course, gr eatly expanded Church of Satan membership. Satanism’s growing popularity has naturally been accompanied by scare stories from religious groups complaining that The Satanic Bible now outsells the Christian Bible on coll ege campuses and is a leading causative factor in youngsters’ turn ing away from God. And certainly one suspects that Pope Paul had LaVey in mind when he issued his worldwide proclamation two years ago that the Devil is “alive” and “a person”, a living, fire-breathing ch aracter spreading evil over the earth. LaVey, main taining that “evil” is “live” spelled backward and should be indulged in and enjoyed, answers the pope and the religious scare groups this way: “People, organizations, nations are making millions of dollars off us. What would they do without us? Without the Church of Satan, they wouldn’t have anybody to rage at and to take the blame for all the rotten things ha ppening in the world. If they rea lly feel this way, they shouldn’t"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"have blown us out of proportion. What you re ally have to believe instead is that they are the charlatans, and they’re really glad to have us around so they can exploit us. We’re an extremely valuable commodity. We’ve helped business, lifte d up the economy, and some of the millions of dollars we have generated have in turn flowed into the Christian church. We have proved many times over the Ninth Satanic Statement that says the church - and countless individuals - cannot exist without the Devil.” For that the Christian church must pay a price. The events that LaVey predicted in the first edition of The Satanic Bible have come to pass. Repressed people have burst their bonds. Sex has exploded, the collective libido has been released, in movies and literat ure, on the streets, and in the home. People are dancing topless and bottomless. Nuns have thrown off their traditional habits, exposed their legs, and danced the “Missa Solemn is Rock” that LaVey thought he was conjuring up as a prank. There is a ceaseles s universal quest for entertainment, gourmet foods and wines, adventure, enjoyment of the here and now. Human ity is no longer willing to wait for any afterlife that promises to reward the clean, pure - transl ate: ascetic, drab - spir it. There is a mood of neopaganism and hedonism, and from it there have em erged a wide variety of brilliant individuals - doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers, writers, stockbrokers, real estate developers, actors and actresses, mass communications media people (to c ite a few categories of Satanists) - who are interested in formalizing and perpetuating th is all-pervading religi on and way of life. It is not an easy religion to a dopt in a society ruled so long by Puritan ethics. There is no false altruism or mandatory love-thy-neighbor concept in this religion. Satanism is a blatantly selfish, brutal philosophy. It is based on the belief that human beings are inherently selfish, violent creatures, that life is a Darwinian struggle for surviv al of the fittest, that only the strong survive and the earth will be ruled by those who fight to win the ceaseless competition that exists in all jungles - including those of urbanized society. Abhor this br utal outlook if you will; it is based, as it has been for centuries, on real conditions that exist in the wo rld we inhabit rather than the mystical lands of milk and honey depicted in the Christian Bible. In The Satanic Bible, Anton LaVey has explained the phi losophy of Satanism more profoundly than any of his ancestors in th e Kingdom of Darkness, while de scribing in detail the innovative rituals and trappings he has devised to create a church of realists. It has been clear from the first edition that many people want to read this book to learn how to start Sata nic groups and ritualize black magic. The Satanic Bible and The Satanic Rituals are the only books that have demonstrated, in a way that is authentic and true to relevant traditions, how all of that can be done. There have been many imitators, never attributing their source, and with good reason; because once the shabbiness and shallowness of the imitators have been compared to LaVey’s pioneering work, there can no longer be any market for the ripoff artists. The evidence is clear to any who are willing to view the re cord: Anton LaVey brought Satan out of the closet and the Church of Satan is the fountainhead of contemporary Satanism. This book summarizes the message both convey, and remains bot h challenge and inspira tion, as timely today as when it was written. S AN F RANCISCO December 25, 1976 (XI Anno Satanas) "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION by Peter H. Gilmore This introduction was used starting in 2005 O PENING THE A DAMANTINE G ATES An Introduction to The Satanic Bible by Magus Peter H. Gilmore This book has the potential to change your life – it did mine. It is a diabolical work, written with elegance, earthiness, and might, serving quite magi cally as a mirror. If you look within these pages and see yourself; if you find its principles to be those you’ve lived by as long as you can remember; if you feel the evocation of an overwhelming se nse of homecoming, then you will have discovered that you are a part of a scattere d “meta-tribe,” and the proper name for what you are is “Satanist.” I first encountered Anton Szandor LaVey through The Satanic Bible , at the age of thirteen when I was an avowed atheist. Not being partial to lite rature promoting faith of any sort, I was pleasantly surprised that this was no rant by some one claiming direct contact with Satan. Instead, I found a common sense, rational, materi alist philosophy, along with theatrical ritual techniques meant as self-transformative psychodrama. Here was a tool perfectly suited to my nature as a means for getting the most out of my life. I knew that “ath eist” was no longer sufficient as a designation for myself. This book lead me to meet and befriend LaVey, working with him to administer the Church he created, and finally to succeed him as the second High Priest of the Church of Satan. It is one of Anton LaVey’s numerous talents that his written words are vivid, brimming with his distinct personality. His well-wrought phrases give the sense of encountering the man himself, and such an impression is not a de lusion. When my wife, Peggy Nadram ia, and I met The Doctor” (an affectionate moniker used by those close him), we agreed that here was exactly the man we had dared to expect from reading his books. Unlike the founders of other religions who claimed ‘ins piration” delivered through some supernatural entity, LaVey readily acknowledged th at he used his own faculties to synthesize Satanism. He based it on both hi s understanding of the human anim al acquired from life experience and the wisdom he’d gained from other advocates of materialism, pragmatism, and individualism. His blasphemously named “Church of Satan” was consciously designed to be an adversary to existing “spiritual’ belief systems. It was the fi rst organization promulgating religious philosophy championing Satan as the symbol of liberty and individualism. Concerning his role as founder he said that, “If he didn’t do it himself, someone else, per haps less qualified, would have.” His perceptive insights thus lead him to give a proper name to a human type that has always been part of our species. LaVey was born in Chicago in 1930, and his pa rents soon relocated to California, that westernmost gathering place for the brightest a nd darkest manifestations of that “American Dream.” It was a fertile environment for the sens itive child who would even tually mature into a role the press would dub “The Black Pope.” From his Eastern European grandmother, young LaVey learned of the superstitions that are still exta nt in that part of the world. These tales whetted his appetite for the outré, leading h im to become absorbed in classic dark literature such as Dracula and Frankenstein. He also became an avid reader of the pulp magazines, which first published tales now deemed classics of the horror and science fi ction genres. He later befriended seminal Weird Tales authors such as Clark Ashton Smith, Robe rt Barbour Johnson, and Ge orge Has. His fancy was captured by fictional characters found in the works of Jack London and Somerset Maugham, in comic strip characters like Ming the Merciless, as well as by historical figu res of a diabolical cast such as Cagliostro, Rasputin, and Basil Zaharoff. Mo re interesting to him than the available occult literature, which he dismissed as being little mo re than sanctimonious white magic, were books applied obscure knowledge such as Dr. William We sley Cook’s Practical Lessons in Hypnotism, Jane’s Fighting Ships, and ma nuals for handwriting analysis. His musical abilities were noticed early, and he was given free reign by his parents to try his hand at various instruments. LaVey was mainly at tracted to the keyboards because of their scope"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"and versatility. He found time to practice and c ould easily reproduce songs heard by ear without recourse to fake books or sheet music. This talent would prove to be one of his main sources of income for many years, particularly his calliope playing during his carnival days, and later his many stints as an organist in bars, lounges, a nd nightclubs. These venues gave him the chance to study how various melodic lines and chord progressi ons swayed the emotions of his audiences, from the spectators at the carnival and spook show s to the individuals se eking solace for the disappointments in their lives in distilled spirits and the smoke-f illed taverns for which LaVey’s playing provided a moody soundtrack. His odd interests marked him as an outsider, a nd he did not alleviate this by feeling any compulsion to be “one of the boys.” He despised gy m class and team sports and often cut classes to follow his own interests. Moving be yond the standard school texts, he absorbed volumes analyzing human behavior on every level, from the impulses of the individual to the dynamics of the herd. He watched films that would later be labeled film noir as well as German expressionist cinema such as M, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari , and the Dr. Mabuse movies. His taste for flashy apparel also served to amplify his aliena tion from the mainstream. He dropped out of high school to hang around with hoodlum types and gravitated towards working in the circus and carnivals, first as a roustabout and cage boy and la ter as a musician. His always-active curiosity was rewarded as he “learne d the ropes” from the carnies. He worked an act with the big cats–he had an affinity for these powerful predators-and la ter assisted with the machinations of the spook shows. He became well-ve rsed in the many rackets used to separate the rubes from their money, along with the psychology that lead people to su ch pursuits. Under the name “The Great Szandor” he played calliope an d organ for the bawdy shows on Saturday nights, as well as for tent revivalists on Sunday morni ngs, seeing many of the same men attending both and noting this telling contradiction. All of these activities provided a firm, earthy background for his evolving cynical worldview. When the carnival season ended, LaVey would earn money by playing organ in Los Angeles area burlesque houses, and he relates that it was duri ng this period that he met and had a brief affair with a then-unknown Marilyn Monroe , after accompanying her “chain- dragging” stript ease at the Mayan Burlesque Theater. Moving back to San Francisco, LaVey worked for a while as a photographer for the police department, and, during th e Korean War, enrolled in San Francisco City College as a criminology major to avoid the draft. Both his studies and occupation revealed grim insights into human nature and conf irmed his rejection of spiritual doctrines. At this time he met and married Carole Lansing, who bore him his fi rst daughter Karla Maritza, in 1952. A few years earlier LaVey had examined the writings of Aleist er Crowley, so in 1951 he decided to meet some of the Berkeley Thelemites. He was unimpressed, as they were more mystical and less “wicked” than he supposed they should be for di sciples of Crowley’ s libertine creed. During the 1950s, LaVey supplemented his income as an investigator of alleged supernatural phenomena, handing “nut calls” referred to him by friends in the police department. These experiences proved to him that many people were inclined to seek a bizarre, “otherworldly” explanation for phenomena that ha d prosaic causes. His rational expl anations often disappointed the complainants, so LaVey invented exotic sources to make them feel better, giving him insight as to how belief functions in people’s lives. In 1956 he purchased a Victorian house on Calif ornia Street in San Francisco’s Richmond District. It was reputed to have been a speakeasy, and was tricked out with secret passages, possibly to aid in clandestine carnal activities. He painte d it black, thus creating a haunted intrusion on an otherwise typical block, matching hi s own unique presence. It was onl y natural that it would later become home to the Church of Satan. After his death, the building remained unoccupied, a brooding “shunned house,” until it was demolished on October 17 of 2001 by the real estate company that owned the property. LaVey met and became entranced by Diane Hegarty in 1959; he then left Carole in 1960. Hegarty and LaVey never married, but she bore him his second daughter, Zeena Galatea in 1964 and was his companion for many years. Hegarty and LaVey later separated; she sued him for palimony and this was settled out of court. Through his “ghost busting,” and his frequent public gigs as an organist, including playing the Wurlitzer at the Lost Weekend cocktail lounge, LaVey became a local celebrity and his holiday"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"parties attracted many San Francisco notables. Gu ests included Carin de Plessin, called “the Baroness” as she had grown up in the royal pala ce of Denmark, anthropologist Michael Harner, Chester A. Arthur III (grandson to the U.S. Presid ent), Forrest J. Ackerman (later, the publisher of Famous Monsters of Filmland and acknowledged expert on science fiction), author Fritz Leiber, local eccentric Dr. Cecil E. Ni xon (creator of the musical au tomaton Isis), and underground filmmaker Kenneth Anger. From this crowd LaVey distilled what he calle d a “Magic Circle” of associates who shared his interest in the bizarre, the hidden side of what moves the world. As his expertise grew, LaVey began pres enting Friday night lectures su mmarizing the fruits of his research. In 1965, LaVey was featured on the “T he Brother Buzz Show”, a humorous children’s program hosted by marionettes. The focus was on LaVey’s “Addams Family” lifestyle—making a living as a hypnotist, investigator of the paranormal, and organist , as well as on his highly unusual pet Togare, a Nubian lion. In the process of creating his lectures, LaVey noticed many common threads, which he then began weaving into a tenebrous c onceptual tapestry. When a member of his Magic Circle suggested that he had the basis for a new religion LaVey agr eed and decided to found the Church of Satan as the best means for communicating his ideas. And so, in 1966 on the night of May Eve—the traditional Witches’ Sabbath—LaVey declared the founding of the Church of Satan and renumbered 1966 as the year One, Anno Satanas— the first year of the Age of Satan. The attention of the press soon followed, particularly with the wedding of Radical journalist John Raymond to New York socialite Judith Ca se on February 1st, 1967. Famed photographer Joe Rosenthal was sent by the San Francisco Chronicle to capture an image that went onward to the pages of the Los Angeles Times and other prominent newspapers. LaVey began the mass dissemination of his Philosophy via the release of a record album, The Satanic Mass (Murgenstrumm, 1968). The album featured a co ver graphic named by LaVey as the “Sigil of Baphomet”: the goat head in a pentagram, circled with the Hebrew word “Leviathan,” which has since become the ubiquitous symbol of Satanism. Featured on the album was part of the rite of baptism written for three-year-old Zeena (performed on May 23rd, 1967). In addition to the actual recording of a Satanic ritual, side two of the LP had LaVey reading excerpts from the as-yet- unpublished The Satanic Bible over music by Beethoven, Wagner, and Sousa. His Friday lectures continued and he institute d a series of “Witches’ Workshops” to instruct women in the art of attaining their will through glamour, feminine wile s, and the skillful discovery and exploitation of men’s fetishes. By the end of 1969, LaVey had taken monographs he had written to explain the philosophy and ritual practices of the Church of Satan and expanded them. His influences included philosophers such as Ayn Rand, Nietzsche, and Mencken, the base wisdom of the carnival folk, the observations of P.T. Barnum, and finally the imagery of th e archfiend found in Twai n, Milton, Byron, and other romantics. He prefaced these essays and rites with reworked excerpts from Ragnar Redbeard’s Might is Right and concluded it with “Satani zed” versions of John Dee’s Enochian Keys to create The Satanic Bible . It has never gone out of print and rema ins the main source for the contemporary Satanic movement. The philosophy presented in it is an integrated whole, not a smorgasbord from which one can pick and choose. It is meant only for a select fe w who are epicurean, pragmatic, worldly, atheistic, fiercely individualistic, materialis tic, rational, and darkly poetic. There may be fellow-travelers— atheists, misanthropes, humanists, freethinkers—who see only a partial reflection of themselves in this showstone. Satanism may thus attract these types in some wa ys, but ultimately it is not for them. If it was only a philosophy, such individualis ts might be welcome; it is more. Satanism moves into the realm of religion by having an aesthetic component, a system of symbolism, metaphor, and ritual in which Satan is embraced not as some Devil to be worshipped, but as a symbolic external projection of the highest poten tial of each individual Sata nist. The identification Satanists have with Satan is an intentional barrier ag ainst those who cannot resonate with this sinister archetype. The Satanic Bible was followed in 1971 by The Compleat Witch (re-released in 1989 as The Satanic Witch), a manual that teaches “Lesser Magic”—the ways and means of reading and manipulating people and their actions toward the fulfillment of one’s desired goals. The Satanic Rituals (1972) was printed as a companion volume to The Satanic Bible and contains “Greater Magic” rituals culled from a Satanic tradition id entified by LaVey in various world cultures. Two"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"collections of essays, which range from the hum orous and insightful to the gleefully sordid, The Devil’s Notebook (1992) and Satan Speaks (1998), complete his written canon. Since its founding, LaVey’s Church of Satan at tracted many varied people who shared an alienation from conventional religio ns, including celebrities Jayne Mansfield and Sammy Davis Jr., as well as rock stars King Diamond, Marilyn Ma nson, and Marc Almond who all became, at least for a time, card-carrying members. He numbered among his associates Robert Fu est, director of the Vincent Price “Dr. Phibes” films as well as The Devil’s Rain; Jacques Vallee, ufologist and computer scientist, who was used as the basis for the character Lacombe, played by Francois Truffaut, in Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind; and Aime Michel known as a spelunker and publisher of Morning of the Magicians. LaVey’s influence spread through articles in the news media throughout the world, popular magazines such as Look, McCalls, Argosy, Newsweek, Time, and later Seconds, The Nose, and Rolling Stone, numerous men’s magazines, and via talk s hows such as Joe Pyne, Phil Donahue, and Johnny Carson. This publicity left a mark on novels like Rosemary’s Baby (completed by Ira Levin during the early days of the Church’s high profile media blitz) and Leiber’s Our Lady of Darkness, and films such as Rosemary’s Baby (1968), The Devil’s Rain (1975), The Car (1977), Dr. Dracula (1980), and many of the “Devil Cult” films from the 1970s through today that picked up on symbolism from LaVey’s writings. A feature length documentary, Satanis: The Devil’s Mass (1969) covered the rituals and ph ilosophy of the Church, while LaVe y himself was profiled in Nick Bougas’ 1993 video documentary Speak of the Devil. The Doctor’s musicianship is preserved on several recordings, primarily Strange Music (1994) and Satan Takes a Holiday (1995). These reflect his penchant for tunes from the 1930s through the 1950s, which range from humorous to doom-laden as well as devil-themed songs. LaVey renders them on a series of self-program med synthesizers, imitating various instrumental groups. They are impressive, as these are not multi-track recordings, but are done in one take with the sounds of the full instrumental ensemble created through the si multaneous use of numerous synthesizers played by LaVey’s dexterous fingers as well as his feet on an organ-style foot pedal keyboard hooked-up via midi. While his relationship with Diane Hegarty crumbl ed in the late 70s, a new lady would enter his life to become his final companion. Blanche Ba rton became his helpmate, co-conspirator, High Priestess, lover, and best friend. She bore hi m his only son, Satan Xerxes Carnacki LaVey on November 1, 1993. As his health deteriorated in the mid-90s, LaVey preferred to spend time only with the people whom he found enriching, gaini ng him a reputation as a recluse. He died on October 29, 1997, of complications ar ising from heart disease. Th ere was no deathbed repentance. He went proudly as he lived, as a Satanist, his only regrets being that he was leaving the great party that was life, and that he would miss seeing his young son Xerxes grow to manhood. According to LaVey’s wishes, Barton succeeded him as the head of the Church after his death. In 2001, she passed on this position to myself, Pe ter H. Gilmore, by then a longtime church administrator and member of the Council of Nine . In 2002, Magistra Barton exchanged her position as High Priestess with my wife Magistra Peggy Nadramia, another veteran administrator who was serving as chair of the Council of Nine. Two biographies have been written about LaVey: The Devil’s Avenger (1974) by Burton Wolfe and Secret Life of a Satanist (1990) by Blanche Barton. In recent years detractors of LaVey with rather obvious agendas have disputed the authentic ity of some of the events chronicled in these books. They accuse him of fabrication and self-p romotional exaggeration. LaVey was a skilled showman, a talent he never denied. However, the in cidents detailed in both bi ographies that can be authenticated via photographic, te stimonial, and documentary evidence far outweigh the items in dispute. The fact remains that LaVey pursued a course that exposed him to unusual individuals from all strata of society. It climaxed with his founding of the Church of Satan, which lead to international notoriety. He wa s gifted beyond what is normally considered a standard for excellence, turning his hand to many arts with a deftness usually gained through dedication to only one muse. He lived his life as a true exemplar of all that he exto lled—pursuing his pleasures without stinting while producing works only at tained through vigorous self-discipline. LaVey succeeded in avoiding the fate of Mrs. Cassan, a character from Charles G. Finney’s The Circus of Dr. Lao, a favored novel of The Doctor. Her doom wa s to die and be forgotten, for her"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"life produced nothing that was memorable in either a creative or destructive manner. With his thoughts, now presented in multiple languages, c ontinuing to inspire like minds around the globe, Anton Szandor LaVey has won a place in the aren a of philosophical and re ligious discourse. We Satanists owe him our gratitude for symbolically opening the adamantine gates of Hell, by giving form and structure to a philosophy that names us as the Gods of our own s ubjective universes. His ultimate heresy against the complacent masses was to reject their idolized dictum that all men are equal. Consequently he challenged his comrades to exercise their facultie s to judge and be judged in all that they do. He dethrone d the seeking of external savior s and championed responsibility for all of one’s actions and the resultant consequences. That is perhaps the most frightening principle to a society wherein none are held accountable for their behavior. The Church of Satan remains a world-spanning cabal of those who work to continue human society’s momentum along the vector set by LaVe y. It shall remain the treasured domain of an imperious few, who live by their own blood and brains, who proudly reject any “good guy badge” and embrace the title of Satanist. There is nothing to fear in The Satanic Bible, for it will not transform you into something that you are not. It cannot convert you, or persuade you in directions not inherent in your nature. It s power lies in its ability to show you what you are through your reaction to its contents. Embrace them, and your life shall gain a new focus, for you will have sharpened your understanding of your self, and you will see more clearly how you differ from those around you. Reject some or all of these hardnosed postulates, and you are free to move on towards whatever other spiritual or con ceptual haven that pr ovides you with satisfaction. However, you will no longer be ignorant of what it means to be a Sa tanist. If you’ve graspe d these fundamentals and have the talent to read people, you might notice that there are su ch individuals about you, and like LaVey himself, that they are some of the most just and fascinating folks you’ll have the pleasure of knowing.

Writer after writer, in efforts to state the principles of \"white and black magic\", has succeeded instead in clouding the entire issue so badly that the would - be student of sorcery winds up st upidly pushing a planchette over a Ouija board, standing inside a pentagram waiting for a demon to present itself, limply tossing I - Ching yarrow stalks like so many stale pretzels, shuffling pasteboards to foretell a future which has lost any meaning, atte nding seminars guaranteed to flatten his ego - while doing the same to his wallet - and in general making a blithering fool of himself in the eyes of those who know! The true magus knows that occult bookshelves abound with the brittle relics of frightened minds and sterile bodies, metaphysical journals of self - deceit, and constipated rule - books of Eastern mysticism. Far too long has the subject of Satanic magic and philosophy been written down by wild - eyed journalists of the right - hand path. The old literat ure is the by - product of brains festering with fear and defeat, written unknowingly for the assistance of those who really rule the earth, and who, from their Hellish thrones, laugh with noisome mirth. The flames of Hell burn brighter for the kindling supp lied by these volumes of hoary misinformation and false prophecy. Herein you will find truth - and fantasy.

Each of these deities and their respective priests and ministers have attempted to find wisdom in their own lies. The ice age of religious thought can la st but a limited time in this great scheme of human existence. The gods of wisdom - defiled have had their saga, and their millennium hath become as reality. Each, with his own \"divine\" path to paradise, hath accused the other of heresies and spiritual indis cretions. The Ring of the Nibelungen doth carry an everlasting curse, but only because those who seek it think in terms of \"Good\" and \"Evil\" - themselves being at all times \"Good\". The gods of the past have become as their own devils in order to live. Feeb ly, their ministers play the devil's game to fill their tabernacles and pay the mortgages on their temples. Alas, too long have they studied \"righteousness\", and poor and incompetent devils they make. So they all join hands in \"brotherly\" unity, and in the ir desperation go to Valhalla for their last great ecumenical council. \"Draweth near in the gloom the twilight of the gods.\" The ravens of night have flown forth to summon Loki, who hath set Valhalla aflame with the searing trident of the Inferno. The twil ight is done. A glow of new light is borne out of the night and Lucifer is risen, once more to proclaim: \"This is the age of Satan! Satan Rules the Earth!\" The gods of the unjust are dead. This is the morning of magic, and undefiled wisdom. The FLESH preva ileth and a great Church shall be builded, consecrated in its name.

The Devil has been attacked by the men of God relentlessly and without reservation. Never has there been an opportunity, short of fiction, for the Dark Prince to speak out in the same manner as the spokesmen of the Lord of the Righteous. The pulpit - pounders of the past have been free to define \"good\" and \"evil\" as they see fit, and have gladly smashed into oblivion any who disagree with their lies - both verbally and, at times, physically. Their talk of \"charity\", when applied to His Infernal Majesty, becomes an empty sham - and most unfairly, too, considering the obvious fact that without their Satanic foe their very religions would collapse. How sad, that the allegorical personage most responsible for the success of spiritual religions is shown the least amount of charity and the most consistent abuse - and by those who most unctuously preach the rules of fair play! For all the centuries of shouting - down the Devil has received, he has never shouted back at his detractors. He ha s remained the gentleman at all times, while those he supports rant and rave. He has shown himself to be a model of deportment, but now he feels it is time to shout back. He has decided it is finally time to receive his due. Now the ponderous rule - books of hypocrisy are no longer needed. In order to relearn the Law of the Jungle, a small, slim diatribe will do. Each verse is an inferno. Each word is a tongue of fire.

"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"- W A N T E D ! - GOD DEAD OR ALIVE I T is a popular misconception that the Satanist does not believe in God. The concept of \"God\", as interpreted by man, has been so varied throughout the ages, that the Satanist simply accepts the definition which suits him best. Man has always created his gods, rather than his gods creating him . God is, to some, benign - to others, terrifying. To the Satanist \"God\" - by whatever name he is called, or by no name at all - is seen as the balancing fac tor in nature, and not as being concerned with suffering. This powerful force which permeates and balances the universe is far too impersonal to care about the happiness or misery of flesh -and -blood creatures on this ball of dirt upon which we live. Anyone who thinks of Satan as evil should consider all the men, women, children, and animals who have died because it was \"God's will\". Certainly a person grieving the untimely loss of a loved one would much rather have their loved one with them than in God's h ands! Instead, they are unctuously consoled by their clergyman who says, \"It was God's will, my dear\"; or \"He is in God's hands now, my son.\" Such phrases have been a convenient way for religionists to condone or excuse the mercilessness of God. But if God is in complete control and as benign as he is supposed to be, why does He allow these things to happen? Too long have religionists been falling back on their bibles and rulebooks to prove or disprove, justify, condemn, or interpret. The Satanist realizes that man, and the action and reaction of the universe, is responsible for everything, and doesn't mislead himself into thinking that someone cares. No longer will we sit back and accept \"fate\" without doing anything about it, just because it says so in Cha pter such and such, Psalm so and so - and that's that! The Satanist knows that praying does absolutely no good - in fact, it actually lessens the chance of success, for the devoutly religious too often sit back complacently and pray for a situation which, if they were to do something about it on their own, could be accomplished much quicker! The Satanist shuns terms such as \"hope\" and \"prayer\" as they are indicative of apprehension. If we hope and pray for something to come about, we will not act in a posit ive way which will make it happen. The Satanist, realizing that anything he gets is of his own doing, takes command of the situation instead of praying to God for it to happen. Positive thinking and positive action add up to results. Just as the Satanist d oes not pray to God for assistance, he does not pray for forgiveness for his wrong doings. In other religions, when one commits a wrong he either prays to God for forgiveness, or confesses to an intermediary and asks him to pray to God for forgiveness for his sins. The Satanist knows that praying does no good, confessing to another human being, like himself, accomplishes even less - and is, furthermore, degrading. When a Satanist commits a wrong, he realizes that it is natural to make a mistake - and if he is truly sorry about what he has done, he will learn from it and take care not to do the same thing again. If he is not honestly sorry about what he has done, and knows he will do the same thing over and over, he has no business confessing and asking forgi veness in the first place. But this is exactly what happens. People confess their sins so that they can clear their consciences - and be free to go out and sin again, usually the same sin."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"and be free to go out and sin again, usually the same sin. There are many dif f erent interpretations of God, in the usual sense of the word, as there are types of people. The images run from a belief in a god who is some vague sort of \"universal cosmic mind\" to an anthropomorphic deity with a long white beard and sandals who keeps track of every action of each individual. Even with in the confines of a given religion, the personal interpretations of God differ greatly. Some religions actually go so far as to label anyone who belongs to a religious sect other than their own a heretic, even though the overall doctrines and impressions of godliness are nearly the same. For example: The Catholics believe that the Protestants are doomed to Hell simply because they do not belong to the Catholic Church. In the same way, many splinter groups of the Christian faith, such as the evangelical or revivalist churches, believe that the Catholics are heathens who worship graven images. (Christ is depicted in the image that is most psychologically akin to the individual worshipping him, and yet the Christ i ans criticize \"heathens\" for the worship of gra ven images.) And the Jews have always been given the Devil's name. Even though the god in all of these religions is basically the same, each regards the way chosen by the others as reprehensible, and to top it all, religionists actually PRAY for one anothe r! They have scorn for the brothers of the right -hand path because their religions carry different labels, and somehow this animosity must be released. What better way than through \"prayer\"! What a simperingly polite way of saying: \"I hate your guts,\" is t he thinly disguised device known as praying for your enemy! Praying for one's own enemy is nothing more than bargain -basement anger, and of a decidedly shoddy and inferior quality! If there has been so much violent discrepancy as to the proper way in which to worship God, how many different interpretations of God can there be - and who is right? All devout \"white -lighters\" are concerned with pleasing God so that they might have the \"Pearly Gates\" opened for them when they die. Nevertheless, if a man has not lived his life in accordance with the regulations of his faith, he can at the last minute call a clergyman to his deathbed for a final absolution. The priest or minister will then come running on the double, to \"make everything right\" with God and see to it that his passport to the Heavenly Realm is in order. (The Yezidis, a sect of Devil worshippers, take a different viewpoint. They believe that God is all -powerful, but also all -forgiving, and so accordingly feel that it is the Devil whom they must please , as he is the one who rules their lives while here on earth. They believe so strongly that God will forgive all of their sins once they have been given the last rites, that they feel no need to concern themselves with the opinion God may hold of them whil e they live.) With all of the contradictions in the Christian scriptures, many people currently cannot rationally accept Christianity the way it has been practiced in the past. Great numbers of people are beginning to doubt the existence of God, in the est ablished Christian sense of the word. So, they have taken to calling themselves \"Christian Atheists\". True, the Christian Bible is a mass of contradictions; but what could be more contradictory than the term \"Christian Atheist\"? If prominent leaders of the Christian faith are rejecting the past interpretations of God, how then can their followers be expected to adhere to previous religious tradition?"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"With all the debates about whether or not God is dead, if he isn't he had better have MEDICARE ! THE GOD Y OU SAVE MAY BE YOURSELF A LL religions of a spiritual nature are inventions of man. He has created an entire system of gods with nothing more than his carnal brain. Just because he has an ego, and cannot accept it, he has to externalize it into some gre at spiritual device which he calls \"God\". God can do all the things man is forbidden to do - such as kill people, perform miracles to gratify his will, control without any apparent responsibility, etc. If man needs such a god and recognizes that god, then he is worshipping an entity that a human being invented. Therefore, HE IS WORSHIPPING BY PROXY THE MAN THAT INVENTED GOD . Is it not more sensible to worship a god that he, himself, has created, in accordance with his own emotional needs - one that best rep resents the very carnal and physical being that has the idea -power to invent a god in the first place? If man insists on externalizing his true self in the form of \"God\", then why fear his true self, in fearing \"God\", - why praise his true self in praising \"God\", - why remain externalized from \"God\" IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN RITUAL AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IN HIS NAME ? Man needs ritual and dogma, but no law states that an externalized god is necessary in order to engage in ritual and ceremony performed in a god's name! Could it be that when he closes the gap between himself and his \"God\" he sees the demon of pride creeping forth - that very embodiment of Lucifer appearing in his midst? He no longer can view himself in two parts, the carnal and the spiritual, but s ees them merge as one, and then to his abysmal horror, discovers that they are only the carnal - AND ALWAYS WERE ! Then he either hates himself to death, day by day - or rejoices that he is what he is! If he hates himself, he searches out new and more compl ex spiritual paths of \"enlightenment\" in hopes that he may split himself up again in his quest for stronger and more externalized \"gods\" to scourge his poor miserable shell. If he accepts himself, but recognizes that ritual and ceremony are the important d evices that his invented religions have utilized to sustain his faith in a lie, then it is the SAME FORM OF RITUAL that will sustain his faith in the truth - the primitive pageantry that will give his awareness of his own majestic being added substance. Wh en all religious faith in lies has waned, it is because man has become closer to himself and farther from \"God\"; closer to the \"Devil.\" If this is what the devil represents, and a man lives his life in the devil's fane, with the sinews of Satan moving in h is flesh, then he either escapes from the cacklings and carpings of the righteous, or stands proudly in his secret places of the earth and manipulates the folly -ridden masses through his own Satanic might, until that day when he may come forth in splendor proclaiming \" I AM A SATANIST ! BOW DOWN , FOR I AM THE HIGHEST EMBODIMENT OF HUMAN LIFE !\" "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"SOME EVIDENCE OF A NEW SATANIC AGE T HE seven deadly sins of the Christian Church are: greed, pride, envy, anger, gluttony, lust, and sloth. Satanism advocates i ndulging in each of these \"sins\" as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification. A Satanist knows there is nothing wrong with being greedy, as it only means that he wants more than he already has. Envy means to look with favor upon the po ssessions of others, and to be desirous of obtaining similar things for oneself. Envy and greed are the motivating forces of ambition - and without ambition, very little of any importance would be accomplished. Gluttony is simply eating more than you need to keep yourself alive. When you have overeaten to the point of obesity, another sin - pride - will motivate you to regain an appearance that will renew your self -respect. Anyone who buys an article of clothing for a purpose other than covering his body an d protecting it from the elements is guilty of pride. Satanists often encounter scoffers who maintain that labels are not necessary. It must be pointed out to these destroyers of labels that one or many articles they themselves are wearing are not wearing are not necessary to keep them warm. There is not a person on this earth who is completely devoid of ornamentation. The Satanist points out that any ornamentation of the scoffer's body shows that he, too, is guilty of pride. Regardless of how verbose the c ynic may be in his intellectual description of how free he is, he is still wearing the elements of pride. Being reluctant to get up in the morning is to be guilty of sloth, and if you lie in bed long enough you may find yourself commit t ing yet another sin - lust. To have the faintest stirring of sexual desire is to be guilty of lust. In order to insure the propagation of humanity, nature made lust the second most powerful instinct, the first being self -preservation. Realizing this, the Christian Church made fornication the \"Original Sin\". In this way they made sure no one would escape sin. Your very state of being is as a result of sin - the Original sin! The strongest instinct in every living thing is self -preservation, which brings us to the last of the sev en deadly sins - anger. Is it not our instinct for self -preservation that is aroused when someone harms us, when we become angry enough to protect ourselves from further attack? A Satanist practices the motto, \"If a man smite thee on one cheek, smash him o n the other!\" Let no wrong go unredressed. Be as a lion in the path - be dangerous even in defeat! Since man's natural instincts lead him to sin, all men are sinners; and all sinners go to hell. If everyone goes to hell, then you will meet all your friends there. Heaven must be populated with some rather strange creatures if they all lived for was to go to a place where they can strum harps for eternity. \"Times have changed. Religious leaders no longer preach that all our natural actions are sinful. We no l onger think sex is dirty - or that taking pride in ourselves is shameful - or that wanting something someone else has is vicious.\" Of course not, times have changed! \"If you want proof of this, just look at how liberal churches have become. Why, they're pr acticing all the things that you preach.\""},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Satanists hear these, and similar statements, all the time; and they agree wholeheartedly. BUT , if the world has changed so much, why continue to grasp at the threads of a dying faith? If many religions are denying their own scriptures because they are out of date, and are preaching the philosophies of Satanism, why not call it by its rightful name - Satanism? Certainly it would be far less hypocritical. In recent years there has been an attempt to humanize the spir itual concept of Christianity. This has manifested itself in the most obvious non - spiritual means. Masses which had been said in Latin are now said in native languages - which only succeeds in making the nonsense easier to understand, and at the same time robs the ceremony of the esoteric nature which is consistent with the tenets of the dogma. It is much simpler to obtain an emotional reaction using words and phrases that cannot be understood than it is with statements which even the simplest mind will que stion when hearing them in an understandable language. If priests and ministers were to have used the devices to fill their churches one hundred years ago that they use today, they would have been charged with heresy, called devils, oft - times persecuted, b ut certainly excommunicated without hesitation. The religionists wail, \"We must keep up with the times,\" forgetting that, due to limiting factors and deeply engrained laws of white light religions, there can never be sufficient change to meet the needs of man. Past religions have always represented the spiritual nature of man, with little or no concern for his carnal or mundane needs. They have considered this life but transitory, and the flesh merely a shell; physical pleasure trivial, and pain a worthwhil e preparation for the \"Kingdom of God\". How well the utter hypocrisy comes forth when the \"righteous\" make a change in their religion to keep up with man's natural change! The only way that Christianity can ever completely serve the needs of man is to beco me as Satanism is NOW . It has become necessary for a NEW religion, based on man's natural instincts, to come forth. THEY have named it. It is called Satanism. It is that power condemned that has caused the religious controversy over birth - control measures - a disgruntled admission that sexual activity, for fun, is here to stay. It is the \"Devil\" who caused women to show their legs, to titillate men - the same kind of legs, now socially acceptable to gaze upon, which are revealed by young nuns as they walk a bout in their shortened habits. What a delightful step in the right (or left) direction! Is it possible we will soon see \"topless\" nuns sensually throwing their bodies about to the \"Missa Solemnis Rock\"? Satan smiles and says he would like that fine - many nuns are very pretty girls with nice legs. Many churches with some of the largest congregations have the most hand - clapping, sensual music - also Satanically inspired. After all, the Devil has always had the best tunes. Church picnics, despite all of Aunt Martha's talk about the Lord's Bountiful Harvest, are nothing more than a good excuse for Sunday gluttony; and everyone knows that lots more than Bible reading goes on in the bushes. The fund - raising adjunct to many church bazaars is commonly known as a c arnival, which used to mean the celebration of the flesh; now a carnival is okay because the money goes to the church so that it can preach against the temptations of the Devil! It will be said that these"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"things are only pagan devices and ceremonies - that the Christians borrowed them. True, but the Pagans reveled in the delights of the flesh, and were condemned by the very same people who celebrate their rituals, but call them by different names. Priests and ministers are in the front lines of peace demon strations, and lying on railroad tracks in front of trains carrying war materials, with as much dedication as their brothers of the cloth, from the same seminaries, who are blessing the bullets and bombs and fighting men as chaplains in the armed forces. S omeone must be wrong, someplace. Could it be that Satan is the one qualified to act as accuser? Certainly they named him that! When a puppy reaches maturity it becomes a dog; when ice melts it is called water; when twelve months have been used up, we get a new calendar with the proper chronological name; when \"magic\" becomes scientific fact we refer to it as medicine, astronomy, etc. When one name is no longer appropriate for a given thing it is only logical to change it to a new one which better fits the s ubject. Why, then, do we not follow suit in the area of religion? Why continue to call a religion the same name when the tenets of that religion no longer fit the original one? Or, if religion does preach the same things that it always has, but its followe rs practice nearly none of its teachings, why do they continue to call themselves by the name given to followers of that religion? If you do not believe in what your religion teaches, why continue to support a belief which is contradictory with your feelin gs. You would never vote for a person or issue you did not believe in, so why cast your ecclesiastical vote for a religion which is not consistent with your convictions? You have no right to complain about a political situation you have voted for or suppor ted in any way - which includes sitting back and complacently agreeing with neighbors who approve the situation, just because you are too lazy or cowardly to speak your mind. So it is with religious balloting. Even if you cannot be aggressively honest abou t your opinions because of unfavorable consequences from employers, community leaders, etc., you can, at least, be honest with yourself. In the privacy of your own home and with close friends you must support religion which has YOUR best interests at heart . \"Satanism is based on a very sound philosophy,\" say the emancipated. \"But why call it Satanism? Why not call it something like 'Humanism' or a name that would have the connotation of a witchcraft group, something a little more esoteric - something less b latant.\" There is more than one reason for this. Humanism is not a religion. It is simply a way of life with no ceremony or dogma. Satanism has both ceremony and dogma. Dogma, as will be explained, is necessary. Satanism differs greatly from all other so -called white -light, \"white\" witchcraft or magical groups in the world today. These self -righteous and supercilious religions protest that their members use the powers of magic only for altruistic purposes. Satanists look with disdain upon \"white\" witchcraft groups because they feel that altruism is sinning on the lay -away plan. It is unnatural not to have desire to gain things for yourself. Satanism represents a form of controlled selfishness. This does not mean that you never do anything for anyone else. If you do something to make someone for whom you care happy, his happiness will give you a sense of gratification. Satanism advocates practicing a modified form of the Golden Rule. Our interpretation of this rule is: \"Do unto others as they do unto you\"; bec ause if you \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,\" and they, in turn, treat you badly, it goes against human nature to continue to treat them with consideration. You should do unto others as you would have them"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"do unto you, but if your courte sy is not returned, they should be treated with the wrath they deserve. White witchcraft groups say that if you curse a person, it will return to you three - fold, come home to roost, or in some way boomerang back to the sender. This is yet another indicatio n of the guilt - ridden philosophy which is held by these neo - Pagan, pseudo - Christian groups. White witches want to delve into witchcraft, but cannot divorce themselves from the stigma attached to it. Therefore, they call themselves white magicians, and base seventy - five per cent of their philosophy on the trite and hackneyed tenets of Christianity. Anyone who pretends to be interested in magic or the occult for reasons other that gaining personal power is the worst kind of hypocrite. The Satanist respects Ch ristianity for, at least, being consistent in its guilt - ridden philosophy, but can only feel contempt for the people who attempt to appear emancipated from guilt by joining a witchcraft group, and then practice the same basic philosophy as Christianity. Wh ite magic is supposedly utilized only for good or unselfish purposes, and black magic, we are told, is used only for selfish or \"evil\" reasons. Satanism draws no such dividing line. Magic is magic, be it used to help or hinder. The Satanist, being the magi cian, should have the ability to decide what is just, and then apply the powers of magic to attain his goals. During white magical ceremonies, the practitioners stand within a pentagram to protect themselves from the \"evil\" forces which they call upon for help. To the Satanist, it seems a bit two - faced to call on these forces for help, while at the same time protecting yourself from the very powers you have asked for assistance. The Satanist realizes that only by putting himself in league with these forces can be fully and unhypocritically utilize the Powers of Darkness to his best advantage. In a Satanic magical ceremony, the participants do NOT : join hands and dance \"ring around the rosy\" in a circle; burn candles of various colors for various wishes; call out the names of \"Father, Son and Holy Ghost\" while supposedly practicing Black Arts; pick a \"Saint\" for their personal guide in obtaining help for their problems; dunk themselves in smelly oils and hope the money comes in; meditate so they can arrive at a \"great spiritual awakening\"; recite long incantations with the name of Jesus thrown in for good measure, between every few words, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseam! BECAUSE - This is NOT the way to practice Satanic magic. If you cannot divorce yourself from h ypocritical self - deceit, you will never be successful as a magician, much less a Satanist. The Satanic religion has not merely lifted the coin - it has flipped it completely over. Therefore, why should it support the very principles to which it is complete ly opposed by calling itself anything other than a name which is totally in keeping with the reversed doctrines which make up the Satanic philosophy? Satanism is not a white light religion; it is a religion of the flesh, the mundane, the carnal - all of wh ich are ruled by Satan, the personification of the Left Hand Path. Inevitably, the next question asked is: \"Granted, you can't call it humanism because humanism is not a religion; but why even have a religion in the first place if all you do is what comes naturally, anyway? Why not just do it?\" Modern man has come a long way; he has become disenchanted with the nonsensical dogmas of past religions. We are living in an enlightened age. Psychiatry has made great strides in"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"enlightening man about his true pers onality. We are living in an era of intellectual awareness unlike any the world has ever seen. This is all very well and good, BUT - there is one flaw in this new state of awareness. It is one thing to accept something intellectually, but to accept the sam e thing emotionally is an entirely different matter. The one need that psychiatry cannot fill is man's inherent need for emotionalizing through dogma. Man needs ceremony and ritual, fantasy and enchantment. Psychiatry, despite all the good it has done, has robbed man of wonder and fantasy which religion, in the past, has provided. Satanism, realizing the current needs of man, fills the large grey void between religion and psychiatry. The Satanic philosophy combines the fundamentals of psychology and good, h onest emotionalizing, or dogma. It provides man with his much needed fantasy. There is nothing wrong with dogma, providing it is not based on ideas and actions which go completely against human nature. The quickest way of traveling between two points is in a straight line. If all the guilts that have been built up can be turned into advantages, it eliminates the need for intellectual purging of the psyche in an attempt to cleanse it from these repressions. Satanism is the only religion known to man that acc epts man as he is, and promotes the rationale of turning a bad thing into a good thing rather than bending over backwards to eliminate the bad thing. Therefore, after intellectually evaluating your problems through common sense and drawing on what psychiat ry has taught us, if you still cannot emotionally release yourself from unwarranted guilt, and put your theories into action, then you should learn to make your guilt work for you. You should act upon your natural instincts, and then, if you cannot perform without feeling guilty, revel in your guilt. This may sound like a contradiction in terms, but if you will think about it, guilt can often add a fillip to the senses. Adults would do well to take a lesson from children. Children often take great delight i n doing something they know they are not supposed to. Yes, times have changed, but man hasn't. The basics of Satanism have always existed. The only thing that is new is the formal organization of a religion based on the universal traits of man. For centuri es, magnificent structures of stone, concrete, mortar, and steel have been devoted to man's abstinence. It is high time that human beings stopped fighting themselves, and devoted their time to building temples designed for man's indulgences. Even though ti mes have changed, and always will, man remains basically the same. For two thousand years man has done penance for something he never should have had to feel guilty about in the first place. We are tired of denying ourselves the pleasures of life which we deserve. Today, as always, man needs to enjoy himself here and now, instead of waiting for his rewards in heaven. So, why not have a religion based on indulgence? Certainly, it is consistent with the nature of the beast. We are no longer supplicating weakl ings trembling before an unmerciful \"God\" who cares not whether we live or die. We are self - respecting, prideful people - we are Satanists! "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"HELL, THE DEVIL, AND HOW TO SELL YOUR SOUL S ATAN has certainly been the best friend the church has ever had , as he has kept it in business all these years. The false doctrine of Hell and the Devil has allowed the Protestant and Catholic Churches to flourish far too long. Without a devil to point their fingers at, religionists of the right hand path would have n othing with which to threaten their followers. \"Satan leads you to temptation\"; \"Satan is the prince of evil\"; \"Satan is vicious, cruel, brutal,\" they warn. \"If you give in to the temptations of the devil, you will surely suffer eternal damnation and roast in Hell.\" The semantic meaning of Satan is the \"adversary\" or \"opposition\" or the \"accuser\". The very word \"devil\" comes from the Indian devi which means \"god\". Satan represents opposition to all religions which serve to frustrate and condemn man for his natural instincts. He has been given an evil role simply because he represents the carnal, earthly, and mundane aspects of life. Satan, the chief devil of the Western World, was originally an angel whose duty was to report human delinquencies to God. It wa s not until the Fourteenth Century that he began to be depicted as an evil deity who was part man and part animal, with goat -like horns and hooves. Before Christianity gave him the names of Satan, Lucifer, etc., the carnal side of man's nature was governed by the god which was then called Dionysus, or Pan, depicted as a satyr or faun, by the Greeks. Pan was originally the \"good guy\", and symbolized fertility and fecundity. Whenever a nation comes under a new form of government, the heroes of the past become villains of the present. So it is with religion. The earliest Christians believed that the Pagan deities were devils, and to employ them was to use \"black magic\". Miraculous heavenly events they termed \"white magic\"; this was the sole distinction between the two. The old gods did not die, they fell into Hell and became devils. The bogey, goblin, or bugaboo used to frighten children is derived from the Slavonic \"Bog\" which means \"god\", as does Bhaga in Hindu. Many pleasures revered before the advent of Chri stianity were condemned by the new religion. It required little changeover to transform the horns and cloven hooves of Pan into a most convincing devil! Pan's attributes could be neatly changed into charged -with -punishment sins, and so the metamorphosis wa s complete. The association of the goat with the Devil is found in the Christian Bible, where the holiest day of the year, the Day of Atonement, was celebrated by casting lots for two goats \"without blemish\", one to be offered to the Lord, and one to Azaze l. The goat carrying the sins of the people was driven into the desert and became a \"scapegoat\". This is the origin of the goat which is still used in lodge ceremonies today as it was also used in Egypt, where once a year it was sacrificed to a God. The de vils of mankind are many, and their origins diversified. The performance of Satanic ritual does not embrace the calling forth of demons; this practice is followed only by those who are in fear of the very forces they conjure."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Supposedly, demons are malevol ent spirits with attributes conductive to the deterioration of the people or events that they touch upon. The Greek word demon meant a guardian spirit or source of inspiration, and to be sure, later theologians invented legion upon legion of these harbinge rs of inspiration - all wicked. An indication of the cowardice of \"magicians\" of the right - hand path is the practice of calling upon a particular demon (who would supposedly be a minion of the devil) to do his bidding. The assumption is that the demon, bei ng only a flunky of the devil, is easier to control. Occult lore states that only the most formidably \"protected\" or insanely foolhardy sorcerer would try to call forth the Devil himself. The Satanist does not furtively call upon these \"lesser\" devils, but brazenly invokes those who people that infernal army of long - standing outrage - the Devils themselves!

The pig was despised by the Jews and the Egyptians. It symbolized the gods Frey, Osiris, Adonis, Persephone, Attis, and Demeter, and was sacrificed to Osiris and the Moon. But, in time, it became degraded into a devil. The Phoenicians wor s hipped a fly god, Baal, from which comes the devil, Beelzebub. Both Baal and Beelzebub are identica l to the dung beetle or scarabaeus of the Egyptians which appeared to resurrect itself, much as the mythical bird, the phoenix, rose from its own ashes. The ancient Jews believed, through their contact with the Persians, that the two great forces in the wo rld were Ahura -Mazda, the god of fire, light, life, and goodness; and Ahriman, the serpent, the god of darkness, destruction, death, and evil. These, and countless other examples, not only depict man's devils as animals, but also show his need to sacrifice the original animal gods and demote them to his devils. At the time of the Reformation, in the Sixteenth Century, the alchemist, Dr. Johann Faustus, discovered a method of summoning a demon - Mephistopheles - from Hell and making a pact with him. He signe d a contract in blood to turn his soul over to Mephistopheles in return for the feeling of youth, and at once became young. When the time came for Faustus to die, he retired to his room and was blown to bits as though his laboratory had exploded. This stor y is a protest of the times (the Sixteenth Century) against science, chemistry, and magic. To the Satanist, it is unnecessary to sell your soul to the Devil or make a pact with Satan. This threat was devised by Christianity to terrorize people so they woul d not stray from the fold. With scolding fingers and trembling voices, they taught their followers that if they gave in to the temptations of Satan, and lived their lives according to their natural predil e ctions, they would have to pay for their sinful ple asures by giving their souls to Satan and suffering in Hell for all eternity. People were led to believe that a pure soul was a passport to everlasting life. Pious prophets have taught man to fear Satan. But what of terms like \"God fearing\"? If God is so m erciful, why do people have to fear him? Are we to believe there is nowhere we can turn to escape fear? If you have to fear God, why not be \"Satan fearing\" and at least have the fun that being God fearing denies you? Without such a wholesale fear religioni sts would have had nothing with which to wield power over their followers. The Teutonic Goddess of the Dead and daughter of Loki was named Hel , a Pagan god of torture and punishment. Another \"L\" was added when the books of the Old Testament were formulated . The prophets who wrote the Bible did not know the word \"Hell\"; they used the Hebrew Sheol and the Greek Hades , which meant the grave; also the Greek Tartaros , which was the abode of fallen angels, the underworld (inside the earth), and Gehenna , which was a valley near Jerusalem where Moloch reigned and garbage was dumped and burned. It is from this that the Christian Church has evolved the idea of \"fire and brimstone\" in Hell. The Protestant Hell and the Catholic Hell are places of eternal punishment; how ever, the Catholics also believe there is a \"Purgatory\" where all souls go for a time, and a \"Limbo\" where unbaptized souls go. The Buddhist Hell is divided into eight sections, the first seven of"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"which can be expiated.

Pleasure and pain, like beauty, are in the eye of the beholder. So, when missionaries ventured into Alaska and warned the Eskimos of the horrors of Hell and the blazing lake of fire awaiting tr ansgressors, they eagerly asked: \"How do we get there?\"!) Most Satanists do not accept Satan as an anthropomorphic being with cloven hooves, a barbed tail, and horns. He merely represents a force in nature - the powers of darkness which have been named jus t that because no religion has taken these forces out of the darkness. Nor has science been able to apply technical terminology to this force. It is an untapped res erv oir that few can make use of because they lack the ability use a tool without having to fi rst break down and label all the parts which make it run. It is this incessant need to analyze which prohibits most people from taking advantage of this many faceted key to the unknown - which the Satanist chooses to call \"Satan\". Satan, as a god, demi -god , personal saviour, or whatever you wish to call him, was invented by the formulators of every religion on the face of the earth for only one purpose - to preside over man's so -called wicked activities and situations here on earth. Consequently, anything resulting in physical or mental gratification was defined as \"evil\" - thus assuring a lifetime of unwarr a nted guilt for everyone! So, if \"evil\" they have named us, evil we are - and so what! The Satanic Age is upon us! Why not take advantage of it and LIVE! "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"LOVE AND HATE S ATANISM represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates! You cannot love everyone; it is ridiculous to think you can. If you love everyone and everything you lose your natural powers of selection and wind up being a pretty poor judge of character and quality. If anything is used too freely it loses its true meaning. Therefore, the Satanist believes you should love strongly and completely those who deserve your love, but never turn the other cheek to y our enemy! Love is one of the most intense emotions felt by man; another is hate. Forcing yourself to feel indiscriminate love is very unnatural. If you try to love everyone you only lessen your feelings for those who deserve your love. Repressed hatred ca n lead to many physical and emotional ailments. By learning to release your hatred towards those who deserve it, you cleanse yourself of these malignant emotions and need not take your pent -up hatred out on your loved ones. There has never been a great \"lo ve\" movement in the history of the world that hasn't wound up killing countless numbers of people, we must assume, to prove how much they loved them! Every hypocrite who ever walked the earth has had pockets bulging with love! Every pharisaical religionis t claims to love his enemies, even though when wronged he consoles himself by thinking \"God will punish them\". Instead of admitting to themselves that they are capable of hating their foes and treating them in the manner they deserve, they say: \"There, but for the grace of God, go I,\" and \"pray\" for them. Why should we humiliate and lower ourselves by drawing such inaccurate comparisons? Satanism has been thought of as being synonymous with cruelty and brutality. This is so only because people are afraid to face the truth - and the truth is that human beings are not all benign or all loving. Just because the Satanist admits he is capable of both love and hate, he is considered hateful. On the contrary, because he is able to give vent to his hatred through ritualized expression, he is far more capable of love - the deepest kind of love. By honestly recognizing and admitting to both the hate and the love he feels, there is no confusing one emotion with the other. Without being able to experience one of these em otions, you cannot fully experience the other. "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"SATANIC SEX M UCH controversy has arisen over the Satanic views on \"free love\". It is often assumed that sexual activity is the most important factor of the Satanic religion, and that willingness to par ticipate in sex -orgies is a prerequisite for becoming a Satanist. Nothing could be farther from the truth! In fact, opportunists who have no deeper interest in Satanism than merely the sexual aspects are emphatically discouraged. Satanism does advocate sex ual freedom, but only in the true sense of the word. Free love, in the Satanic concept, means exactly that - freedom to either be faithful to one person or to indulge your sexual desires with as many others as you feel is necessary to satisfy your particul ar needs. Satanism does not encourage orgiastic activity or extramarital affairs for those to whom they do not come naturally. For many, it would be very unnatural and detrimental to be unfaithful to their chosen mates. To others, it would be frustrating t o be bound sexually to just one person. Each person must decide for himself what form of sexual activity best suits his individual needs. Self -deceitfully forcing yourself to be adulterous or to have sex partners when not married just for the sake of provi ng others (or worse yet, to yourself) that you are emancipated from sexual guilt is just as wrong, by Satanic standards, as leaving any sexual need unfulfilled because of ingrained feelings of guilt. Many of those who are constantly preoccupied with demons trating their emancipation from sexual guilt are, in reality, held in even greater sexual bondage than those who simply accept sexual activity as a natural part of life and don't make a big to -do over their sexual freedom. For example, it is an established fact that the nymphomaniac (every man's dream girl and heroine of all lurid novels) is not sexually free, but is actually frigid and roves from man to man because she is too inhibited to ever find complete sexual release. Another misconception is the idea that ability to engage in group sexual activity is the indicative of sexual freedom. All contemporary free -sex groups have one thing in common - discouragement of fetishistic or deviant activity. Actually, the most forced examples of non -fetishistic sexua l activity thinly disguised as \"freedom\" have a common format. Each of the participants in an orgy removes all clothing, following the example set forth by one, and mechanically fornicate - also following the leader's example. None of the performers consid er that their \"emancipated\" form of sex might be regarded as regimented and infantile by non -members who fail to equate uniformity with freedom. The Satanist realizes that if he is to be a sexual connoisseur (and truly free from all sexual guilt) he cannot be stifled by the so -called sexual revolutionists any more than he can by the prudery of his guilt -ridden society. These free -sex clubs miss the whole point of sexual freedom. Unless sexual activity can be expressed on an individual basis (which includes personal fetishes), there is absolutely no purpose in belonging to a sexual freedom organization. Satanism condones any type of sexual activity which properly satisfies your individual desires - be it heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or even asexual, if you choose. Satanism also"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"sanctions any fetish or deviation which will enhance your sex -life, so long as it involves no one who does not wish to be involved. The prevalence of deviant and/or fetishistic behavior in our society would stagger the imagination of the sexually naïve. There are more sexual variants than the unenlightened individual can perceive: transvestism, sadism, masochism, urolagnia, exhibitionism - to name only a few of the more predominant. Everyone has some form of fetish, but because the y are unaware of the preponderance of fetishistic activity in our society, they feel they are depraved if they submit to their \"unnatural\" yearnings. Even the asexual has a deviation - his asexuality . It is far more abnormal to have a lack of sexual desir e (unless illness or old -age, or another valid reason has caused the wane) than it is to be sexually promiscuous. However, if a Satanist chooses sexual sublimination above overt sexual expression, that is entirely his own affair. In many cases of sexual su blimination (or asexuality), any attempt to emancipate himself sexually would prove devastating to the asexual. Asexuals are invariably sexually sublimated by their jobs or hobbies. All the energy and driving interest which would normally be devoted to sex ual activity is channeled into other pastimes or into their chosen occupations. If a person favors other interests over sexual activity, it is his right, and no one is justified in condemning him for it. However, the person should at least recognize the f act that this is a sexual sublimation. Because of lack of opportunity for expression, many secret sexual desires never progress beyond the fantasy stage. Lack of release often leads to compulsion and, therefore, a great number of people devise undetectable methods of giving vent to their urges. Just because most fetishistic activity is not outwardly apparent, the sexually unsophisticated should not delude himself into thinking it does not exist. To cite examples of the ingenious techniques used: The male tr ansvestite will indulge in his fetish by wearing feminine undergarments while going about his daily activities; or the masochistic woman might wear a rubber girdle several sizes too small, so she may derive sexual pleasure from her fetishistic discomfort throughout the day, with no one the wiser. These illustrations are far tamer and more prevalent examples than others which could have been given. Satanism encourages any form of sexual expression you may desire, so long as it hurts no one else . This stateme nt must be qualified, to avoid misinterpretation. By not hurting another, this does not include the unintentional hurt felt by those who might not agree with your views on sex, because of their anxieties regarding sexual morality. Naturally, you should avo id offending others who mean a great deal to you, such as prudish friends and relatives. However, if you earnestly endeavor to escape hurting them, and despite your efforts they accidentally find out, you cannot be held responsible, and therefore should fe el no guilt as a result of either your sexual convictions, or their being hurt because of those convictions. If you are in constant fear of offending the prudish by your attitude towards sex, then there is no sense in trying to emancipate yourself from sex ual guilt. However, no purpose is served by flaunting your permissiveness. The other exception to the rule regards dealings with masochists. A masochist derives pleasure from being hurt; so denying the masochist his pleasure -through -pain hurts him just as much as actual physical pain hurts the non -masochist. The story of the truly cruel sadist illustrates this point: The masochist says to the sadist, \"beat me.\" To which the merciless sadist replies, \" NO !\" If a person wants to be hurt and enjoys suffering, t hen there is no reason"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"not to indulge him in his wont. The term \"sadist\" in popular usage describes one who obtains pleasure from indiscriminate brutality. Actually, though, a true sadist is selective. He carefully chooses from the vast reserve of appropri ate victims, and takes great delight in giving those who thrive on misery the fulfillment of their desires. The \"well - adjusted\" sadist is epicurean in selecting those on whom his energies will be well - spent! If a person is healthy enough to admit he is a m asochist and enjoys being enslaved and whipped, the real sadist is glad to oblige! Aside from the foregoing exceptions, the Satanist would not intentionally hurt others by violating their sexual rights. If you attempt to impose your sexual desires upon oth ers who do not welcome your advances, you are infringing upon their sexual freedom. Therefore, Satanism does not advocate rape, child molesting, sexual defilement of animals, or any other form of sexual activity which entails the participation of those who are unwilling or whose innocence or naïveté would allow them to be intimidated or misguided into doing something against their wishes. If all parties involved are mature adults who willingly take full responsibility for their actions and voluntarily engag e in a given form of sexual expression - even if it is generally considered taboo - then there is no reason for them to repress their sexual inclinations. If you are aware of all the implications, advantages, and disadvantages, and are certain your actions will hurt no one who does not wish or deserve to be hurt, you have no cause to suppress your sexual preferences. Just as no two people are exactly the same in their choice of diet or have the same capacity for the consumption of food, sexual tastes and ap petites vary from person to person. No person or society has the right to set limitations on the sexual standards or the frequency of sexual activity of another. Proper sexual conduct can only be judged within the context of each individual situation. Ther efore, what one person considers sexually correct and moral may be frustrating to another. The reverse is also true; one person may have great sexual prowess, but it is unjust for him to belittle another whose sexual capacity may not equal his own, and inc onsiderate for him to impose himself upon the other person, i.e., the man who has a voracious sexual appetite, but whose wife's sexual needs do not match his own. It is unfair for him to expect her to enthusiastically respond to his overtures; but she must display the same degree of thoughtfulness. In the instances when she does not feel great passion, she should either passively, but pleasantly , accept him sexually, or raise no complaint if he chooses to find his needed release elsewhere - including auto - e rotic practices. The ideal relationship is one in which the people are deeply in love with one another and are sexually compatible. However, perfect relationships are relatively uncommon. It is important to point out here that spiritual love and sexual lov e can, but do not necessarily, go hand in hand. If there is a certain amount of sexual compatibility, often it is limited; and some, but not all, of the sexual desires will be fulfilled. There is no greater sexual pleasure than that derived from associatio n with someone you deeply love, if you are sexually well - suited. If you are not suited to one another sexually, though, it must be stressed that lack of sexual compatibility does not indicate lack of spiritual love. One can, and often does, exist without t he other. As a matter of fact, often one member of a couple will resort to outside sexual activity because he deeply loves his mate, and wishes to avoid hurting or imposing upon his loved one. Deep spiritual love is enriched by sexual"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"love, and it is certa inly a necessary ingredient for any satisfactory relationship; but because of differing sexual predil e ctions, outside sexual activity or masturbation sometimes provides a needed supplement. Masturbation, considered a sexual taboo by many people, creates a guilt problem not easily dealt with. Much emphasis must be placed on this subject, as it constitutes an extremely important ingredient of many a successful magical working. Ever since the Judaeo -Christian Bible described the sin of Onan (Gen. 38:7 -10), man has considered the seriousness and consequences of the \"solitary vice\". Even though modern sexologists have explained the sin of Onan as simply coitus interruptus , the damage has been done through centuries of theological misinterpretation. Aside from act ual sex crimes, masturbation is one of the most frowned upon sexual acts. During the last century, innumerable texts were written describing the horrific consequences of masturbation. Practically all physical or mental illnesses were attributed to the evil s of masturbation. Pallor of the complexion, shortness of breath, furtive expression, sunken chest, nervousness, pimples and loss of appetite are only a few of the many characteristics supposedly resulting from masturbation; total physical and mental colla pse was assured if one did not heed the warnings in those handbooks for young men. The lurid descriptions in such texts would be almost humorous, were it not for the unhappy fact that even though contemporary sexologists, doctors, writers, etc. have done m uch to remove the stigma of masturbation, the deep -seated guilts induced by the nonsense in those sexual primers have been only partially erased. A large percentage of people, especially those over forty, cannot emotionally accept the fact that masturbatio n is natural and healthy, even if they now accept it intellectually; and they, in turn, relate their repugnance, often subconsciously, to their children. It was thought that one would go insane if, despite numerous admonitions, his auto -erotic practices pe rsisted. This preposterous myth grew from reports of wide -spread masturbation by the inmates of mental institutions. It was assumed that since almost all incurably insane people masturbated, it was their masturbation that had driven them mad. No one ever s topped to consider the lack of sexual partners of the opposite sex and the freedom from inhibition, which is a characteristic of extreme insanity, were the real reasons for the masturbatory practices of the insane. Many people would rather have their mates seek outside sexual activity than perform auto - erotic acts because of their own guilt feelings, the mate's repugnance towards having them engage in masturbation, or the fear of their mate's repugnance - although in a surprising number of cases, a vicariou s thrill is obtained from the knowledge that the mate is having sexual experiences with outsiders - although this is seldom admitted. If stimulation is provided by envisioning one's mate sexually engaged with others, this should be brought out into the ope n where both parties may gain from such activities. However, if the prohibition of masturbation is only due to guilt feelings on the part of one or both parties, they should make every attempt to erase those guilts - or utilize them. Many relationships mig ht be saved from destruction if the people involved did not feel guilt about performing the natural act of masturbation. Masturbation is regarded as evil because it produces pleasure derived from intentionally"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"fondling a \"forbidden\" area of the body by one 's own hand. The guilt feelings accompanying most sexual acts can be assuaged by the religiously -acceptable contention that your sensual delights are necessary to produce off -spring - even though you cautiously watch the calendar for the \"safe\" days. You c annot, however, placate yourself with this rationale while engaging in masturbatory practices. No matter what you've been told about the \"immaculate conception\" - even if blind faith allows you to swallow this absurdity - you know full well if you are to p roduce a child, there must be sexual contact with a person of the opposite sex! If you feel guilty for committing the \"original sin,\" you certainly will feel even deeper guilt for performing a sex act only for self - gratification, with no intention of creat ing children. The Satanist fully realizes why religionists declare masturbation to be sinful. Like all other natural acts people will do it, no matter how severely reprimanded. Causing guilt is an important facet of their malicious scheme to obligate peopl e to atone for \"sins\" by paying the mortgages on temples of abstinence! Even if a person is no longer struggling under the burden of religiously -induced guilt (or thinks he isn't), modern man still feels shame if he yields to his masturbatory desires. A ma n may feel robbed of his masculinity if he satisfies himself auto -erotically rather than engaging in the competitive game of woman chasing. A woman may satisfy herself sexually but yearns for the ego -gratification that comes from the sport of seduction. Ne ither the quasi Casanova nor bogus vamp feels adequate when \"reduced\" to masturbation for sexual gratification; both would prefer even an inadequate partner. Satanically speaking, though, it is far better to engage in a perfect fantasy than to cooperate in an unrewarding experience with another person. With masturbation, you are in complete control of the situation. To illustrate the undebatable fact that masturbation is an entirely normal and healthy practice: it is performed by all members of the animal k ingdom. Human children will also follow their insti n ctive masturbatory desires, unless they have been scolded for it by their indignant parents, who were undoubtably berated for it by their parents, and so on down the retrocedent line. It is unfortunate, bu t true, that the sexual guilts of parents will immutably be passed on to their children. In order to save our children from the ill -fated sexual destiny of our parents, grandparents, and possibly ourselves, the perverted moral code of the past must be expo sed for what it is: a pragmatically organized set of rules which, if rigidly obeyed, would destroy us! Unless we emancipate ourselves from the ridiculous sexual standards of our present society, including the so -called sexual revolution, the neuroses cause d by those stifling regulations will persist. Adherence to the sensible and humanistic new morality of Satanism can - and will - evolve society in which our children can grow up healthy and without the devastating moral encumbrances of our existing sick so ciety. "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"NOT ALL VAMPIRES SUCK BLOOD! S ATANISM represents responsibility to the responsible, instead of concern for psychic vampires. Many people who walk the earth practice the fine art of making others feel responsible and even indebted to them, w ithout cause. Satanism observes these leeches in their true light. Psychic vampires are individuals who drain others of their vital energy. This type of person can be found in all avenues of society. They fill no useful purpose in our lives, and are neithe r love objects nor true friends. Yet we feel responsible to the psychic vampire without knowing why. If you think you may be the victim of such a person, there are a few simple rules which will help you form a decision. Is there a person you often call or visit, even though you really don't want to, because you know you will feel guilty if you don't? Or, do you find yourself constantly doing favors for one who doesn't come forward and ask, but hints? Often the psychic vampire will use reverse psychology, sa ying: \"Oh, I couldn't ask you to do that\" - and you, in turn, insist upon doing it. The psychic vampire never demands anything of you. That would be far too presumptuous. They simply let their wishes be known in subtle ways which will prevent them from bei ng considered pests. They \"wouldn't think of imposing\" and are always content and willingly accept their lot, without the slightest complaint - outwardly! Their sins are not of commission, but of omission. It's what they don't say, not what they do say, th at makes you feel you must account to them. They are much too crafty to make overt demands upon you, because they know you would resent it, and would have a tangible and legitimate reason for denying them. A large percentage of these people have special \"a ttributes\" which make their dependence upon you more feasible and much more effective. Many psychic vampires are invalids (or pretend to be) or are \"mentally or emotionally disturbed.\" Others might feign ignorance or incompetence so you will, out of pity - or more often, exasperation - do things for them. The traditional way to banish a demon or elemental is to recognize it for what it is, and exorcise it. Recognition of these modern -day demons and their methods is the only antidote for their devastating ho ld over you. Most people accept these passively vicious individuals at face value only because their insidious maneuvers have never been pointed out to them. They merely accept these \"poor souls\" as being less fortunate than themselves, and feel they must help them however they can. It is this misdirected sense of responsibility (or unfounded sense of guilt) which nourishes well the \"altruisms\" upon which these parasites feast! The psychic vampire is allowed to exist because he cleverly chooses conscientiou s, responsible people for his victims - people with great dedication to their \"moral obligations.\" In some cases we are vampirized by groups of people, as well as individuals. Every fund raising organization, be it a charitable foundation, community counci l, religious or fraternal association, etc., carefully selects a person who is adept at making others feel guilty for its"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"chairman or coordinator. It is the job of this chairman to intimidate us into opening first our hearts, and then our wallets, to the r ecipient of their \"good will\" - never mentioning that, in many cases, their time is not unselfishly donated, but that they are drawing a fat salary for their \"noble deeds.\" They are masters at playing upon the sympathy and consideration of responsible peop le. How often we see little children who have been sent forth by these self - righteous Fagins to painlessly extract donations from the kindly. Who can resist the innocent charm of a child? There are, of course, people who are not happy unless they are givin g, but many of us do not fit into this category. Unfortunately, we are often put upon to do things we do not genuinely feel should be required of us. A conscientious person finds it very difficult to decide between voluntary and imposed charity. He wants t o do what is right and just, and finds it perplexing trying to decide exactly who he should help and what degree of aid should rightfully be expected of him. Each person must decide for himself what his obligations are to his respective friends, family, and community. Before donating his time and money to those outside his immediate family and close circle of friends, he must decide what he can afford, without depriving those closest to him. When taking these things into consideration he must be certain to include himself among those who mean most to him. He must carefully evaluate the validity of the request and the personality or motives of the person asking it of him. It is extremely difficult for a person to learn to say \"no\" when all his life he has sai d \"yes.\" But unless he wants to be constantly taken advantage of, he must learn to say \"no\" when circumstances justify doing so. If you allow them, psychic vampires will gradually infiltrate your everyday life until you have no privacy left - and your cons tant feeling of concern for them will deplete you of all ambition. A psychic vampire will always select a person who is relatively content and satisfied with his life - a person who is happily married, pleased with his job, and generally well -adjusted to t he world around him - to feed upon. The very fact that the psychic vampire chooses to victimize a happy person shows that he is lacking all the things his victim has; he will do everything he can to stir up trouble and disharmony between his victim and tho se people he holds dear. Therefore, be wary of anyone who seems to have no real friends and no apparant interest in life (except you). He will usually tell you he is very selective in his choice of friends, or doesn't make friends easily because of the hi gh standards he sets for his companions. (To acquire and keep friends, one must be willing to give of himself - something of which the psychic vampire is incapable.) But he will hasten to add that you fulfill every requirement and are truly an outstanding exception among men - you are one of the very few worthy of his friendship. Lest you confuse desperate love (which is a very selfish thing) with psychic vampirism, the vast difference between the two must be clarified. The only way to determine if you are being vampirized is to weigh what you give the person compared to what they give you in return. You may, at times, become annoyed with the obligations put upon you by a loved one, a close friend, or even an employer. But before you label them psychic vampi res, you must ask yourself, \"What am I getting in return?\" If your spouse or lover insists that you call them frequently, but you also require them to account to you for their time spent away from you, you must realize this is a give and take situation. Or , if a friend is in the habit of calling upon"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"you for help at inopportune moments, but you similarly depend upon them to give your immediate needs priority, you must regard it as a fair exchange. If your employer asks you to do a little more than is normal ly expected of you in your particular position, but will overlook occasional tardiness or will give you time off when you need it, you certainly have no cause for complaint and need not feel he is taking advantage of you. You are, however, being vampirized if you are incessantly called upon or expected to do favors for someone who, when you need a favor, always happens to have other \"pressing obligations.\" Many psychic vampires will give you material things for the express purpose of making you feel you owe them something in return, thereby binding you to them. The difference between your giving, and theirs, is that your return payment must come in a non -material form. They want you to feel obligated to them, and would be very disappointed and even resentful if you attempted to repay them with mater i al objects. In essence, you have \"sold your soul\" to them, and they'll constantly remind you of your duty to them, by not reminding you. Being purely Satanic, the only way to deal with a psychic vampire is to \"play dumb\" and act as though they are genuinely altruistic and really expect nothing in return. Teach them a lesson by graciously taking what they give you, thanking them loudly enough for all to hear, and walking away! In this way you come out the victor. Wha t can they say? And when you are inevitably expected to repay their \"generosity,\" (this is the hard part!) you say \" NO \" - but again, graciously! When they feel you falling from their clutches two things will happen. First, they will act \"crushed,\" hoping y our old feeling of duty and sympathy will return, and when (and if) it doesn't, they will show their true colors and will become angry and vindictive. Once you have moved them to this point, YOU can play the role of the injured party. After all, you've don e nothing wrong - you just happened to have had \"pressing obligations\" when they needed you, and since nothing was expected in return for their gifts, there should be no hard feelings. Generally, the psychic vampire will realize his methods have been disco vered and will not press the issue. He will not continue to waste his time with you, but will move on to his next unsuspecting victim. There are times, however, when the psychic vampire will not release his hold so easily, and will do everything possible t o torment you. They have plenty of time for this because, when once rejected, they wil l neglect all else (what little else they have, that is) to devote their every waking moment to planning the revenge to which they feel they are entitled. For this reason, it is best to avoid a relationship with this kind of person in the first place. Their \"adulation\" and dependence upon you may, at first, be very flattering, and their material gifts very attractive, but you will eventually find yourself paying for them ma ny times over. Don't waste your time with people who will ultimately destroy you, but concentrate instead on those who will appreciate your responsibility to them, and, likewise, feel responsible to you. And if you are a psychic vampire - take heed! Beware of the Satanist - he is ready and willing to gleefully drive the proverbial stake through your heart! "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"INDULGENCE . . . NOT COMPULSION THE HIGHEST PLATEAU OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IS THE AWARENESS OF THE FLESH ! S ATANISM encourages its followers to indu lge in their natural desires. Only by doing so can you be a completely satisfied person with no frustrations which can be harmful to yourself and others around you. Therefore, the most simplified description of the Satanic belief is: INDULGENCE INSTEAD OF ABSTINENCE People often mistake compulsion for indulgence, but there is a world of difference between the two. A compulsion is never created by indulging, but by not being able to indulge. By making something taboo, it only serves to intensify the desire. Everyone likes to do the things they have been told not to. \"Forbidden fruits are sweetest.\" Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary defines indulgence thusly: \"To give oneself up to; not to restrain or oppose; to give free course to; to gratify by compliance; t o yield to.\" The dictionary definition of compulsion is: \"The act of compelling or driving by a force, physical or moral; constraint of the will; (compulsory, obligatory).\" In other words, indulgence implies choice, whereas compulsion indicates the lack of choice. When a person has no proper release for his desires they rapidly build up and become compulsions. If everyone had a particular time and place for the purpose of periodically indulging in their personal desires, without fear of embarrassment or rep roach, they would be sufficiently released to lead unfrustrated lives in the everyday world. They would be free to plunge headlong into whatever undertaking they might choose instead of going about their duties half -heartedly, their creative urges frustrat ed by denying their natural desires. This would apply in the majority of cases, but there will always be those who work better under pressure. Generally, those who need to endure a certain amount of hardship to produce to their full capabilities are in bas ically artistic vocations. (More will be said later about fulfillment through self -denial.) This does not mean to imply that all artists fit into this category. On the contrary, many artists are unable to produce unless their basic animal needs have been satisfied. For the most part, it is not the artist or individualist, but the average middle -class working man or woman who is lacking the proper release for their desires. It is ironic that the responsible, respectable person - the one who pays society's bi lls - should be the one given the least in return. It is he who must be ever conscious of his \"moral obligations\", and who is condemned for normally indulging in his natural desires. The Satanic religion considers this a gross injustice. He who upholds his responsibilities should be most entitled to the pleasures of his choice, without censure from the society he serves. Finally a religion (Satanism) has been formed which commends and rewards those who support the society in which they live, instead of deno uncing them for their human needs."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"From every set of principles (be it religious, political, or philosophical), some good can be extracted. Amidst the madness of the Hitlerian concept, one point stands out as a shining example of this - \"strength through j oy!\". Hitler was no fool when he offered the German people happiness, on a personal level , to insure their loyalty to him, and peak efficiency from them. It has been clearly established that the majority of all illnesses are of a psychosomatic nature, and that psychosomatic illnesses are a direct result of frustration. It has been said that \"the good die young\". The good, by Christian standards, do die young. It is the frustration of our natural instincts which leads to the deterioration of our minds and bo dies. It has become very fashionable to concentrate on the betterment of the mind and spirit, and to consider giving pleasure to one's body (the very shell without which the mind and spirit could not exist) to be coarse, crude, unrefined. AS OF LATE, MOST PEOPLE WHO DEEM THEMSELVES EMANCIPATED HAVE LEFT NORMALCY ONLY TO \"TRANSCEND\" INTO IDIOCY ! By way of bending their behinds around to meet their navels, subsisting on wild and exotic diets like brown rice and tea, they feel they will a r rive at a great state of spiritual development. \"Hogwash!\" says the Satanist. He would rather eat a good hearty meal, exercise his imagination, and transcend by means of physical and emotional fulfillment. It seems, to the Satanist, that after being harnessed with unreasonable religious demands for so many centuries, one would welcome the chance to be human for once! If anyone thinks that by denying his natural desires he can avoid mediocrity, he should examine the Eastern mystical beliefs which have been in great intellectual f avor in recent years. Christianity is \"old -hat\", so those who wish to escape its fetters have turned to so -called enlightened religions, such as Buddhism. Although Christianity is certainly deserving of the criticism it has received, perhaps it has been ta king more than its share of the blame. The followers of the mystical beliefs are every bit as guilty of the little humanisms as the \"misguided\" Christians. Both religions are based on trite philosophies, but the mystical religionists profess to be enlighte ned and emancipated from the guilt -ridden dogma which is typified by Christianity. However, the Eastern mystic is even more preoccupied than the Christian with avoiding animalistic actions that remind him he is not a \"saint\", but merely a man - only anothe r form of animal, sometimes better, more often worse , than those who walk on all fours; and who, bec a use of his \"divine spiritual and intellectual development\", has become the most vicious animal of all! The Satanist asks, \"What is wrong with being human, and having human limitations as well as assets?\" By denying his desires the mystic has come no closer to overcoming compulsion than his kindred soul, the Christian. The Eastern mystical beliefs have taught people to contemplate their navels, stand on their heads, stare at blank walls, avoid the use of labels in life, and discipline themselves against any desire for materialistic pleasure. Nevertheless, I am sure you have seen just as many so -called d i sciplined yogis with the inab i lity to control a smoking habit as anyone else; or just as many supposedly emancipated Buddhists become just as excited as a \"less aware\" person when they are confronted with a member of the opposite - or in some cases, the same - sex. Yet when asked to explain the reason for their hypocrisy, these people retreat into the ambiguousness which characterizes their faith - no one can pin them down if there are no straight answers that can be given! The simple fact of the matter is that the very thing which has led this type of person to a faith which preaches abstinence, is indulgence . Their compulsive masochism is the reason for"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"choosing a religion which not only advocates self - denial, but praises them for it; and gives them a sacrosanct avenue of expression for their masochistic needs. The more abuse they can stand, the holier they become. Masochism, to most people, represents a rejection of indulgence. Satanism points out many meanings behind the meanings, and considers masochism to be an indulgence if any attempt to sway or change the person from his masochistic traits is met with resentment and/or failure. The Satanist does not condemn these people for giving vent to their masochistic desires, but he does feel the utmost contempt towards those who cannot be honest enough (at least wit h themselves) to face and accept their masochism as a natural part of their personality make - up. Having to use religion as an excuse for their masochism is bad enough, but these people actually have the effrontery to feel superior to those who are not boun d - up in self - deceitful expression of their fetishes! These people would be the first to condemn a man who found his weekly release with a person who would beat him soundly, thereby releasing himself from the very thing which could, if unreleased, make him - as they are - a compulsive church - goer or religious fanatic. By finding adequate release for his masochistic desires, he no longer needs to debase and deny himself in his every waking moment, as do these compulsive masochists. Satanists are encouraged to indulge in the seven deadly sins, as they need hurt no one; they were only invented by the Christian Church to insure guilt on the part of its followers. The Christian Church knows that it is impossible for anyone to avoid committing these sins, as they a re all things which we, being human, most naturally do. After inevitably committing these sins financial offerings to the church in order to \"pay off\" God are employed as a sop to the parishioner's conscience! Satan has never needed a book of rules, becaus e vital natural forces have kept man \"sinful\" and intent on preserving himself and his feelings. Nevertheless, demoralizing attempts have been made on his body and being for his \"soul's\" sake, which only illustrate how misconceived and misused the labels o f \"indulgence\" versus \"compulsion\" have become. Sexual activity certainly is condoned and encouraged by Satanism, but obviously the fact that it is the only religion which honestly takes this stand, is the reason it has been traditionally given so much lit erary space. Naturally, if most people belong to the religions which repress them sexually, anything written on this provocative subject is going to make for titillating reading. If all attempts to sell something (be it a product or an idea) have failed - sex will always sell it. The reason for this is that even though people now consciously accept sex as a normal and necessary function, their subconscious is still bound by the taboo which religion has placed upon it. So, again, what is denied is more inten sely desired. It is this bugaboo regarding sex which causes the literature devoted to the Satanic views on the subject to overshadow all else written about Satanism. The true Satanist is not mastered by sex any more than he is mastered by any of his other desires. As with all other pleasurable things, the Satanist is master of , rather than mastered by sex. He is not the perverted fiend who is just waiting for the opportunity to deflower every young virgin, nor is he the skulking degenerate who furtively han gs around in the \"dirty\" bookstores, slavering over the \"nasty\" pictures. If pornography fills his needs for the moment, he unashamedly buys some \"choice items\" and guiltlessly peruses them at his leisure."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"\"We have to accept the fact that man has become di sgruntled at being constantly repressed, but we must do everything we can to at least temper the sinful desires of man, lest they run rampant in this new age,\" say the religionists of the right - hand path to the questioning Satanist. \"Why continue to think of these desires as shameful and something to be repressed, if you now admit they are natural?\" returns the Satanist. Could it be that the white - light religionists are a bit \"sour - grapes\" about the fact that they didn't think of a religion, before the Sata nists, which would be enjoyable to follow; and if the truth were known, would they too not like to have a bit more pleasure out of life, but for fear of losing face, cannot admit it? Could it also be that they are afraid people will, after hearing about Sa tanism, tell themselves \"This is for me - why should I continue with a religion which condemns me for everything I do, even though there is nothing actually wrong with it?\" The Satanist thinks this is more than likely true. There is certainly much evidence that past religions are, every day, lifting more and more of their ridiculous restrictions. Even so, when an entire religion is based on abstinence instead of indulgence (as it should be) there is little left when it has been revised to meet the current n eeds of man.

Combine this rationale with the fact that a dying creature is expending an overabundance of adrenal and other biochemical energies, and you ha ve what appears to be an unbeatable combination. The \"white\" magician, wary of the consequences involved in the killing of a human being, naturally utilizes birds, or other \"lower\" creatures in his ceremonies. It seems these sanctimonious wretches feel no guilt in the taking of a non -human life, as opposed to a human's. The fact of the matter is that if the \"magician\" is worthy of his name, he will be uninhibited enough to release the necessary force from his own body , instead of from an unwilling and undes erving victim! Contrary to all established magical theory, the release of this force is NOT effected in the actual spilling of blood, but in the death throes of the living creature! This discharge of bioelectrical energy is the very same phenom e non which occurs during any profound heightening of the emotions, such as: sexual orgasm, blind anger, mortal terror, consuming grief, etc. Of these emotions, the easiest entered into of one's own violation are sexual orgasm and anger, with grief running a close thir d.

The inhibitive and asinine absurdity in the need to kill an innocent living creature at the high - point of a ritual, as practiced by erstwhile \"wizards\", is obviously their \"lesser of the evils\" when a discharge of energy is c alled for. These poor conscience -stricken fools, who have been calling themselves witches and warlocks, would sooner chop the head off a goat or chicken in an attempt to harness its death agony, than have the \"blasphemous\" bravery to masturbate in full vie w of the Jehovah whom they claim to deny! The only way these mystical cowards can ritualistically release themselves is through the agony of another's death (actually their own, by proxy) rather than the indulgent force which produces life! The treaders of the path of white light are truly the cold and the dead! No wonder these tittering pustules of \"mystical wisdom\" must stand within protective circles to bind the \"evil\" forces in order to keep themselves \"safe\" from attack - ONE GOOD ORGASM WOULD PROBABLY KILL THEM ! The use of a human sacrifice in a Satanic ritual does not imply that the sacrifice is slaughtered \"to appease the gods\". Symbolically , the victim is destroyed through the working of a hex or curse, which in turn leads to the physical, mental or emotional destruction of the \"sacrifice\" in ways and means not attributable to the magician."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The only time a Satanist would perform a human sacrifice would be if it were to serve a two - fold purpose; that being to release the magician's wrath in the throwi ng of a curse, and more important, to dispose of a totally obnoxious and deserving individual. Under NO circumstances would a Satanist sacrifice any animal or baby! For centuries, propagandists of the right - hand path have been prattling over the supposed s acrifices of small children and voluptuous maidens at the hands of diabolists. It would be thought that anyone reading or hearing of these heinous accounts would immediately question their authenticity, taking into consideration the biased sources of the s tories. On the contrary, as with all \"holy\" lies which are accepted without reservation, this assumed modus operandi of the Satanists persists to this day! There are sound and logical reasons why the Satanists could not perform such sacrifices. Man, the an imal, is the godhead to the Satanist. The purest form of carnal existence reposes in the bodies of animals and human children who have not grown old enough to deny themselves their natural desires. They can perceive things that the average adult human can never hope to. Therefore, the Satanist holds these beings in a sacred regard, knowing he can learn much from these natural magicians of the world. The Satanist is aware of the universal custom of the treader of the path of Agarthi; the killing of the god. Inasmuch as gods are always created in man's own image - and the average man hates what he sees in himself - the inevitable must occur: the sacrifice of the god who represents himself. The Satanist does not hate himself, nor the gods he might choose, and h as no desire to destroy himself or anything for which he stands! It is for this reason he could never willfully harm an animal or child. The question arises, \"Who, then, would be considered a fit and proper human sacrifice, and how is one qualified to pass judgment on such a person?\" The answer is brutally simple. Anyone who has unjustly wronged you - one who has \"gone out of his way\" to hurt you - to deliberately cause trouble and hardship for you or those dear to you. In short, a person asking to be curse d by their very actions. When a person, by his reprehensible behavior, practically cries out to be destroyed, it is truly your moral obligation to indulge them their wish. The person who takes every opportunity to \"pick on\" others is often mistakenly calle d \"sadistic\". In reality, this person is a misdirected masochist who is working towards his own destruction. The reason a person viciously strikes out against you is because they are afraid of you or what you represent, or are resentful of your happiness. They are weak, insecure, and on extremely shaky ground when you throw your curse, and they make ideal human sacrifices. It is sometimes easy to overlook the actual wrongdoing of the victim of your curse, when one considers how \"unhappy\" a person he really is. It is not so easy, though, to retrace the damaging footsteps of your antagonist and make right those practical situations he or she has made wrong. The \"ideal sacrifice\" may be emotionally insecure, but nonetheless can, in the machinations of his insec urity, cause severe damage to your tranquility or sound reputation. \"Mental illness\", \"nervous breakdown\", \"maladjustment\", \"anxiety neuroses\", \"broken homes\", \"sibling rivalry\", etc., etc., ad infinitum have too long been convenient excuses for vicious an d irresponsible actions. Anyone who says \"we must try to understand\" those who make life miserable for those undeserving of misery is aiding and abetting a social cancer!

Therefore, you have every right to (symbolically) destroy them, and if your curse provokes their actual annihilation, rejoice that you have been instrumental in ridding the world of a pest!

"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"LIFE AFTER DEATH THROUGH FULFILLMENT OF THE EGO M AN is aware that he will die, someday. Other animals, when nearing death, know they are about to die; but it is not until death is certain that the animal senses his coming departure from this world. And even then he does not know exactly what is entailed in dying. It is often pointed out that animals accept death gracefully, without fear or resistance. This is a beautiful concept, but one that only holds true in cases where death for the animal is unavoidable. When an animal is sick or injured he will fight for his li fe with every ounce of strength he has left. It is this unshakable will to live that, if man were not so \"highly evolved\", would also give him the fighting spirit he needs to stay alive. It is a well known fact that many people die simply because they give up and just don't care anymore. This is understandable if the person is very ill, with no apparent chance for recovery. But this often is not the case. Man has become lazy. He has learned to take the easy way out. Even suicide has become less repugnant to many people than any number of other sins. Religion is totally to blame for this. Death, in most religions, is touted as a great spiritual awakening - one which is prepared for throughout life. This concept is very appealing to one who has not had a satis factory life; but to those who have experienced all the joys life has to offer, there is a great dread attached to dying. This is as it should be. It is this lust for life which will allow the vital person to live on after the inevitable death of his flesh ly shell. History shows that men who have given their own lives in pursuit of an ideal have been deified for their martyrdom. Religionists and political leaders have been very crafty in laying their plans. By holding the martyr up as a shining example to h is fellow men, they eliminate the common sense reaction that willful self -destruction goes against all animal logic. To the Satanist, martyrdom and non -personalized heroism is to be associated not with integrity, but with stupidity. This, of course, does n ot apply to the situations which involve the safety of a loved one. But to give one's own life for something as impersonal as a political or religious issue is the ultimate in masochism. Life is the one great indulgence; death the one great abstinence. To a person who is satisfied with his earthly existence, life is like a party; and no one likes to leave a good party. By the same token, if a person is enjoying himself here on earth he will not so readily give up this life for the promise of an afterlife ab out which he knows nothing. The Eastern mystical beliefs teach humans to discipline themselves against any conscious will for success so they might d i ssolve themselves into \"Universal Cosmic Awareness\" - anything to avoid good healthy self -satisfaction or honest pride in earthly accomplishments! It is interesting to note that the areas in which this type of belief flourishes are those where material gains are not easily obtainable. For this reason the predominant religious belief must be one which commends its followers for their rejection of material things and their avoidance of the use of labels which attaches a certain amount of importance to material gains. In this"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"way the people can be pacified into accepting their lot, no matter how small it may be. S atanism uses many labels. If it were not for names, very few of us would understand anything in life, much less attach any significance to it; - and significance compels recognition, which is something everyone wants, especially the Eastern mystic who trie s to prove to everyone he can meditate longer or stand more deprivation and pain than the next fellow. The Eastern philosophies preach the dissolution of man's ego before he can produce sins. It is unfathomable to the Satanist to conceive of an ego which w ould willfully choose denial of itself. In countries where this is used as a sop for the willingly impoverished, it is understandable that a philosophy which teaches the denial of the ego would serve a useful purpose - at least for those in power, to whom it would be detrimental if their people were discontented. But for anyone who has every opportunity for material gain, to choose this form of religious thought seems foolish, indeed! The Eastern mystic believes strongly in reincarnation. To a person who ha s virtually nothing in this life, the possibility that he may have been a king in a past life or may be one in the next life is very attractive, and does much to appease his need for self - respect. If there is nothing in which they can take pride in this li fe, they can console themselves by thinking, \"there are always future lives.\" It never occurs to the believer in reincarnation that if his father, grandfather, and great - grandfather, etc. had developed \"good karmas\", by their adherence to the same beliefs and ethics as his present ones - then why is he now living in privation, rather than like a maharajah? Belief in reincarnation provides a beautiful fantasy world in which a person can find the proper avenue of ego - expression, but at the same time claim to have dissolved his ego. This is emphasized by the roles people choose for themselves in their past or future lives. Believers in reincarnation do not always choose an honorable character. If the person is of a highly respectable and conservative nature, he will often choose a colorful rogue or gangster, thereby fulfilling his alter - ego. Or, a woman who has much social status may pick a harlot or famous courtesan for the characterization of herself in a past life. If people were able to divorce themselves fr om the stigma attached to personal ego - fulfillment, they would not need to play self - deceitful games such as belief in reincarnation as a means of satisfying their natural need for ego - fulfillment. The Satanist believes in complete gratification of his ego . Satanism, in fact, is the only religion which advocates the intensification or encouragement of the ego. Only if a person's own ego is sufficiently fulfilled, can he afford to be kind and complimentary to others, without robbing himself of his self - respe ct. We generally think of a braggart as a person with a large ego; in reality, his bragging results from a need to satisfy his impoverished ego. Religionists have kept their followers in line by suppressing their egos. By making their followers feel inferi or, the awesomeness of their god is insured. Satanism encourages its members to develop a good strong ego because it gives them the self - respect necessary for a vital existence in this life."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"If a person has been vital throughout his life and has fought to the end for his earthly existence, it is this ego which will refuse to die, even after the expiration of the flesh which housed it. Young children are to be admired for their driving enthusiasm for life. This is exemplified by the small child who refuses t o go to bed when there is something exciting going on, and when once put to bed, will sneak down the stairs to peek through the curtain and watch. It is this child -like vitality that will allow the Satanist to peek through the curtain of darkness and death and remain earthbound. Self -sacrifice is not encouraged by the Satanic religion. Therefore, unless death comes as an indulgence because of extreme circumstances which make the termination of life a welcome relief from the unendurable earth l y existence, su icide is frowned upon by the Satanic religion. Religious martyrs have taken their own lives, not because life was intolerable for them, but to use their supreme sacrifice as a tool to further the religious belief. We must assume, then, that suicide, if don e for the sake of the church, is condoned and even encouraged - even though their scriptures label it a sin - because religious martyrs of the past have always been deified. It is rather curious that the only time suicide is considered sinful by other reli gions is when it comes as an indulgence. "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS T HE highest of all holidays in the Satanic religion is the date of one's own birth. This is in direct contradiction to the holy of holy days of other religions, which deify a particular go d who has been created in an anthropomorphic form of their own image, thereby showing that the ego is not really buried. The Satanist feels: \"Why not really be honest and if you are going to create a god in your image, why not create that god as yourself.\" Every man is a god if he chooses to recognize himself as one. So, the Satanist celebrates his own birthday as the most important holiday of the year. After all, aren't you happier about the fact that you were born than you are about the birth of someone y ou have never even met? Or for that matter, aside from religious holidays, why pay higher tribute to the birthday of a president or to a date in history than we do to the day we were brought into this greatest of all worlds? Despite the fact that some of u s may not have been wanted, or at least were not particularly planned, we're glad, even if no one else is, that we're here! You should give yourself a pat on the back, buy yourself whatever you want, treat yourself like the king (or god) that you are, and generally celebrate your birthday with as much pomp and ceremony as possible. After one's own birthday, the two major Satanic holidays are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween (or All Hallows' Eve). St. Walpurgis - or Walpurga, or Walburga, depending upon the time and area in which one is referring to her - was born in Sussex about the end of the Seventh or the beginning of the Eighth Century, and was educated at Winburn, Dorset, where after taking the veil, she remained for twenty -five years. She then, at the inst ance of her uncle, St. Boniface, and her brother, St. Wilibald, set out along with some other nuns to found religious houses in Germany. Her first settlement was at Bischofsheim in the diocese of Mainz, and two years later (754 A.D.) she became abbess of t he Benedictine nunnery at Heidenheim, within her brother Wilibald's diocese of Eichstadt in Bavaria, where another brother, Winebald, had at the same time also been made head of a monastery. On the death of Winebald in 760 she succeeded him in his charge, retaining the superintendence of both houses until her death on February 25, 779. Her relics were translated to Eichstadt, where she was laid in a hollow rock, from which exuded a kind of bituminous oil, afterwards known as Walpurgis oil, regarded as havin g miraculous efficacy against disease. The cave became a place of pilgrimage, and a great church was built over the spot. She is commemorated at various times, but principally on May 1st, her day taking the place of an earlier Pagan festival. Amazingly eno ugh, all of this rigmarole was found necessary simply to condone the continuance of the most important Pagan festival of the year - the grand climax of the spring equinox! The Eve of May has been memorialized as the night that all of the demons, specters, afreets, and banshees would come forth and hold their wild revels, symbolizing the fruition of the spring equinox. Halloween - All Hallows' Eve, or All Saints' Day - falls on October 31st or November 1st. Originally, All Hallows' Eve was one of the great f ire festivals of Britain at the time of the Druids. In Scotland it was associated with the time when the spirits of the dead, the demons, witches, and sorcerers were unusually active and propitious. Paradoxically, All Hallows' Eve"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"was also the night when y oung people performed magical rituals to determine their future marriage partners. The youth of the villages carried on with much merry - making and sensual revelry, but the older people took great care to safeguard their homes from the evil spirits, witches , and demons who had exceptional power that night. The solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated as holidays, as they herald the first day of the seasons. The difference between a solstice and an equinox is a semantic one defining the relationship betwee n the sun, moon, and the fixed stars. The solstice applies to summer and winter; the equinox refers to autumn and spring. The summer solstice is in June, and the winter solstice is in December. The autumn equinox is in September, and the spring equinox is in March. Both the equinoxes and the solstices vary a day or two from year to year, depending on the lunar cycle at the time, but usually fall on the 21st or 22nd of the month. Five to six weeks after these days the legendary Satanic revels are celebrated. "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE BLACK MASS N O other single device has been associated with Satanism as much as the black mass. To say that the most blasphemous of all religious ceremonies is nothing more than a literary invention is certainly a statement which needs qualifyi ng - but nothing could be truer. The popular concept of the black mass is thus: a defrocked priest stands before an altar consisting of a nude woman, her legs spread -eagled and vagina thrust open, each of her outstretched fists grasping a black candle made from the fat of unbaptized babies, and a chalice containing the urine of a prostitute (or blood) reposing on her belly. An inverted cross hangs above the altar, and triangular hosts of ergot -laden bread or black -stained turnip are methodically blessed as the priest dutifully slips them in and out of the altar -lady's labia. Then, we are told, an invocation to Satan and various demons is followed by an array of prayers and psalms chanted backwards or interspersed with obscenities . . . all performed within t he confines of a \"protective\" pentagram drawn on the floo r . If the Devil appears he is invariably in the form of a rather eager man wearing the head of a black goat upon his shoulders. Then follows a potpour r i of flagellation, prayer- book burning, cunnilingus, fellatio, and general hindquarters kissing - all done to a background of ribald recitations from the Holy Bible, and audible expectorations on the cross! If a baby can be slaughtered during the ritual, so much the better; for as everyone knows, this is the favorite sport of the Satanist! If this sounds repugnant, then the success of the reports of the black mass, in keeping the devout in church, is easy to understand. No \"decent\" person could fail to side with the inquisitors when told of these blasphem ies. The propagandists of the church did their job well, informing the public at one time or another of the heresies and heinous acts of the Pagans, Cathars, Bogomils, Templars and others who, because of their dualistic philosophies and sometimes Satanic l ogic, had to be eradicated. The stories of unbaptized babies being stolen by Satanists for use in the mass were not only effective prop a ganda measures, but also provided a constant source of revenue for the Church, in the form of baptism fees. No Christian mother would, upon hearing of these diabolical kidnappings, refrain from getting her child properly baptized, post haste. Another facet of man's nature was apparent in the fact that the writer or artist with lewd thoughts could exercise his most obscene p redilections in the portrayal of the activities of heretics. The censor who views all pornography so that he will know what to warn others of is the modern equivalent of the medieval chronicler of the obscene deeds of the Satanists (and, of course, their m odern journalistic counterparts). It is believed that the most complete library of pornography in the world is owned by the Vatican! The kissing of the Devil's behind during the traditional black mass is easily recognized as the forerunner of the modern te rm used to describe one who will, through appealing to another's ego, gain materially from him. As all Satanic ceremonies were performed toward very real or material goals, the oscularum infame (or kiss of shame) was considered a symbolic requisite towards earthly, rather than spiritual, success. The usual assumption is that the Satanic ceremony or service is always called a black mass. A black mass is not the magical ceremony practiced by Satanists. The Satanist would only"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"employ the use of a black mass as a form of psychodrama. Furthermore, a black mass does not necessarily imply that the performers of such are Satanists. A black mass is essentially a parody of the religious service of the Roman Catholic Church, but can be loosely applied to a satire on an y religious ceremony. To the Satanist, the black mass, in its blaspheming of orthodox rites, is nothing more than a redundancy. The services of all established religions are actually parodies of old rituals performed by the worshippers of the earth and the flesh. In attempts to de -sexualize and de - humanize the Pagan beliefs, later men of spiritual faith whitewashed the honest meanings behind the rituals into the bland euphemisms now considered to be the \"true mass\". Even if the Satanist were to spend each n ight performing a black mass, he would no more be performing a travesty than the devout churchgoer who unwittingly attends his own \"black mass\" - his spoof on the honest and emotionally -sound rites of Pagan antiquity. Any ceremony considered a black mass m ust effectively shock and outrage, as this seems to be the measure of its success. In the Middle Ages, blaspheming the holy church was shocking. Now, however, the Church does not present the awesome image it did during the inquisition. The traditional blac k mass is no longer the outrageous spectacle to the dilettante or renegade priest that it once was. If the Satanist wishes to create a ritual to blaspheme an accepted institution, for the purpose of psychodrama, he is careful to choose one that is not in v ogue to parody. Thus, he is truly stepping on a sacred cow. A black mass, today, would consist of the blaspheming of such \"sacred\" topics as Eastern mysticism, psychiatry, the psychedelic movement, ultra -liberalism, etc. Patriotism would be championed, dru gs and their gurus would be defiled, acultural militants would be deified, and the decadence of ecclesiastical theologies might even be given a Satanic boost. The Satanic magus has always been the catalyst for the dichotomy necessary in molding popular bel iefs, and in this case a ceremony in the nature of a black mass may serve a far - reaching magical purpose. In the year 1666, some rather interesting events occurred in France. With the death of François Mansart, the architect of the trapezoid, whose geometr ics were to become the prototype of the haunted house, the Palace of Versailles was being constructed, in accordance with his plans. The last of the glamorous priestesses of Satan, Jeanne -Marie Bouvier (Madame Guyon) was to be overshadowed by a shrewd oppo rtunist and callous business - woman named Catharine Deshayes, otherwise known as LaVoisin. Here was an erstwhile beautician who, while dabbling in abortions and purveying the most efficient poisons to ladies desirous of eliminating unwanted husbands or love rs, found in the lurid accounts of the \"messes noir\" a proverbial brainstorm. It is safe to say that 1666 was the year of the first \"commercial\" black mass! In the region south of St. Denis, which is now called LaGarenne, a great walled house was purchased by LaVoisin and fitted with dispensaries, cells, laboratories, and . . . a chapel. Soon it became de rigueur for royalty and lesser dilettantes to attend and participate in the very type of service mentioned earlier in this chapter. The organized fraud p erpetrated in these ceremonies has become indelibly marked in history as the \"true black mass\". When LaVoisin was arrested on March 13, 1679 (in the Church of Our Blessed Lady of Good Tidings, incidentally), the die had already been cast. The degraded acti vities of LaVoisin had stifled the majesty of Satanism for many years to come."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Satanism -for -fun -and -games fad next appeared in England in the middle 18th Century in the form of Sir Francis Dashwood's Order of the Medmanham Franciscans , popularly called The Hell -Fire Club. While eliminating the blood, gore, and baby -fat candles of the previous century's masses, Sir Francis managed to conduct rituals replete with good dirty fun, and certainly provided a colorful and harmless form of psychodrama for many of the leading lights of the period. An interesting sideline of Sir Francis, which lends a clue to the climate of the Hell -Fire Club, was a group called the Dilettanti Club, of which he was the founder. It was the 19th Century that brought a whitewashing to Satanism, in the feeble attempts of \"white\" magicians trying to perform \"black\" magic. This was a very paradoxical period for Satanism, with writers such as Baudelaire and Huysmans who, despite their apparent obsession with evil, seemed nice enough fellows . The Devil developed his Luciferian personality for the public to see, and gradually evolved into a sort of drawing -room gentleman. This was the era of \"experts\" on the black arts, such as Eliphas Levi and countless trance -mediums who, with their carefull y bound spirits and demons, have also succeeded in binding the minds of many who call themselves parapsychologists to this day! As far as Satanism is concerned, the closest outward signs of this were the neo -Pagan rites conducted by MacGregor Mathers' Herm etic Order of the Golden Dawn, and Aleister Crowley's later Order of the Silver Star (A. . . A. . . - Argentinum Astrum) and Order of Oriental Templars (O.T.O.) *, which paranoiacally denied any association with Satanism, despite Crowley's self -imposed image of the beast of revelation. Aside from some rat her charming poetry and a smattering of magical bric -a-brac, when not climbing mountains Crowley spent most of his time as a poseur par excellence and worked overtime to be wicked. Like his contemporary, Rev.(?) M o ntague Summers, Crowley obviously spent a large part of his life with his tongue jammed firmly into his cheek, but his followers, today, are somehow able to read esoteric meaning into his every word. Perennially concurrent with these societies were the sex clubs using Satanism as a rationale - tha t persists today, for which tabloid newspaper writers may give thanks. If it appears that the black mass developed from a literary invention of the church, to a depraved commercial actuality, to a psychodrama for dilettantes and iconoclasts, to an ace in the hole for popular media . . . then where does it fit into the true nature of Satanism - and who was practicing Satanic magic in those years beyond 1666? The answer to this riddle lies in another. Is the person generally considered to be a Satanist really practicing Satanism in its true sense , or rather from the point of view taken by the opinion makers of heavenly persuasion? It has often been said, and rightly so, that all of the books about the Devil have been written by the agents of God. It is, theref ore, quite easy to understand how a certain breed of devil worshippers was created through the inventions of theologians. This erstwhile \"evil\" character is not necessarily practicing true Satanism. Nor is he a living embodiment of the element of untrammel ed pride or majesty of self which gave the post -Pagan world the churchman's definition of evil. He is instead the by -product of later and more elaborate propaganda. The pseudo -Satanist has always managed to appear throughout modern history, with his black masses of varying degrees of blasphemy; but the real Satanist is not quite so easily recognized as such.

If the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, then established occultists would do well as maze -makers.

It will be said, by some, that these instructions and procedur es are nothing more than applied psychology, or scientific fact, called by \"magical\" terminology - until they arrive at a passage in the text that is \"based on no known scientific finding\". It is for this reason that no attempt has been made to limit the e xplanations set forth to a set nomenclature. Magic is never totally scientifically explainable, but science has always been, at one time or another, considered magic. There is no difference between \"White\" and \"Black\" magic, except in the smug hypocrisy, guilt -ridden righteousness, and self -deceit of the \"White\" magician himself. In the classical religious tradition, \"White\" magic is performed for altruistic, benevolent, and \"good\" purposes; while \"Black\" magic is used for self -aggrandizement, personal powe r, and \"evil\" purposes. No one on earth ever pursued occult studies, metaphysics, yoga, or any other \"white light\" concept, without ego gratification and personal power as a goal. It just so happens that some people enjoy wearing hair shirts, and others pr efer velvet or silk. What is pleasure to one, is pain to another, and the same applies to \"good\" and \"evil\". Every practitioner of witchcraft is convinced that he or she is doing the \"right\" thing. Magic falls into two categories, ritual or ceremonial, and non -ritual or manipulative. Ritual magic consists of the performance of a formal ceremony, taking place, at least in part, within the confines of an area set aside for such purposes and at a specific time. Its main function is to isolate the otherwise dis sipated adrenal and other emotionally induced energy, and convert it into a dynamically transmittable force. It is purely an emotional, rather than intellectual, act. Any and all intellectual activity must take place before the ceremony, not during it. Thi s type of magic is sometimes known as \" GREATER MAGIC \". Non -ritual or manipulative magic, sometimes called \" LESSER MAGIC \", consists of the wile and guile obtained through various devices and contrived situations, which when utilized, can create \"change, in accordance with one's will\". In olden times this would be called \"fascination\", \"glamour\", or the \"evil eye\". Most of the victims of the witch trials were not witches. Often the victims were eccentric old women who were either senile or did not conform to society. Others were exceptionally attractive women who turned the heads of the men in power, and were not responsive to their advances. The real witches were rarely executed, or even brought to trial, as they were proficient in the art of enchantment and could charm the men and save their own lives. Most of the real witches were sleeping with the inquisitors. This is the origin of the word \"glamour\". The antiquated meaning of glamour is witchcraft. The most important asset to the modern witch is her abilit y to be alluring, or to utilize glamour. The word \"fascination\" has a similarly occult origin. Fascination was the term applied to the evil eye. To fix a person's gaze, in other words, fascinate, was to curse them with the evil eye. Therefore, if a woman had the ability to fascinate men, she was regarded as a witch."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"had the ability to fascinate men, she was regarded as a witch. Learning to effectively utilize the command to LOOK , is an integral part of a witch's or warlock's training. To manipulate a person, you must first be able to attract and hold his attention. The three methods by which the command to look can be accomplished are the utilization of sex, sentiment, or wonder, or any combination of these. A witch must, honestly , decide into which category she most naturally falls. The first category, that of sex, is self - evident. If a woman is attractive or sexually appealing, she should do everything in her power to make herself as enticing as possible, thereby using sex as her most powerful tool. Once she has gained the man's attention, by using her sex appeal, she is free to manipulate him to her will. The second category is sentiment. Usually older woman fit into this category. This would include the \"cookie lady\" type witch, who might live in a little cottage, and be thought of by people as being a bit eccentric. Children are usually enchanted by the fantasy that this type of witch can provide for them, and young adults seek her out for her sage -like advice. Through their innocence, children can recognize her magical power. By conforming to an image of the sweet li ttle old lady next door, she can employ the art of misdirection to accomplish her goals. The third category is the wonder theme. This category would apply to the woman who is strange or awesome in her appearance. By making her strange appearance work for h er, she can manipulate people simply bec a use they are fearful of the consequences should they not do as she asks. Many women fit into more than one of these categories. For example, the young girl who has an appearance of freshness and innocence, but at th e same time is very sexy, combines sex appeal with sinister overtones, uses sex and wonder. After evaluating her assets, each witch must decide into which category or combination of categories she fits, and then utilize these assets in their proper form. To be a successful warlock, a man must similarly fit himself into the proper category. The handsome or sexually appealing man would, naturally, fit into the first category - sex. The second, or sentiment category would apply to the older man who has, perhap s, an elfin or forest wizard appearance. The sweet old grandpa (often a dirty old man!) would also be in the sentiment category. The third type would be the man who presents a sinister or diabolic appearance. Each of these men would apply his particular br and of the command to look, in much the same way as the women previously described. Visual imagery utilized for emotional reaction is certainly the most important device incorporated in the practice of lesser magic. Anyone who is foolish enough to say \"loo ks don't mean a thing\" is indeed deluded. Good looks are unnecessary, but \"looks\" certainly are needed! Odor is another important manipulative factor in lesser magic. Remember, animals fear and distrust anyone or anything that doesn't smell! And even thoug h we may, as human animals, deny many of the judgments based on this sense consciously, we still are motivated by our sense of smell just as surely as any all -fours animal. If you are a man, and wish to enchant a woman, allow the natural secretions of your body to pervade the atmosphere immediately around you, and work in animalistic contrast to the vestments of social politeness that you wear upon your back. If you, as a woman, wish to bewitch a man, do not fear that you might \"offend\" simply because the o ils and fragrances of your flesh have not been scrubbed away, or that place between your thighs is not dry and sterile. These natural odors are the sexual stimulants which nature, in her magical wisdom, has provided."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The sentiment stimulants are those odor s that will appeal to pleasant memories and nostalgia. The enchanting of a man, through his stomach, is first established by the smell of cooking! A \"sentiment\" type of witch will find this one of the most useful of all charms. It is not so facetious to dw ell upon the technique of the man who wished to charm the young lady who had been displaced from her home of childhood joys, which happened to be a fishing village. Wise to the ways of lesser magic, he neatly tucked a mackerel into his trousers pocket, and reaped the rewards that great fondness may often bring. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE THREE TYPES OF SATANIC RITUAL T HERE are three types of ceremony incorporated in the practice of Satanic magic. Each of these correspond to a basic human emotion. The first of these we sha ll call a sex ritual. A sex ritual is what is commonly known as a love charm or spell. The purpose in performing such a ritual is to create desire on the part of the person whom you desire, or to summon a sex partner to fulfill your desires. If you have no specific person or type of person in mind strong enough to cause direct sexual feeling culminating in orgasm, you will not succeed in performing as successful working. The reason for this is that even if the ritual was successful, by accident, what good would it serve if you could not take advantage of your eventual opportunity because of lack of stimulation or desire? It is easy to confuse enchantment for your ulterior motives, with spell -casting to satisfy your sexual desires. Enchantment for self -aggra ndizement, when accompanied by ceremonial magic, falls into the category of either the compassion or the destruction ritual, or possibly both. If you want or need something so badly you are sad or feel much anguish without it, without causing hurt on anoth er's part, then this would incorporate a compassion ritual to increase your power. If you wish to enchant or entrap a deserving victim for your own purposes, you would employ a destruction ritual. These formulas are to be adhered to, as applying the wrong type of ritual towards a desired result can lead to trouble of a complicated nature. A good example of this is the girl who finds herself plagued by a relentless suitor. If she has done little to encourage him, then she should recognize him for the psychic vampire he is, and let him play his masochistic role. If, however, she has enchanted him frivolously, giving him every encouragement and then finds herself a steady object of sexual desire, much to her dismay, she has no one to blame but herself. Such exe rcises are only ego boosts, borne of an indoctrination of ego denial which makes these little bewitchments necessary. The Satanist has enough ego strength to use enchantments for her own sexual gratification, or to gain power or success of a specific natur e. The second type of ritual is of a compassionate nature. The compassion, or sentiment, ritual is performed for the purpose of helping others, or helping oneself. Health, domestic happiness, business activities, material success, and scholastic prowess ar e but a few of the situations covered in a compassion ritual. It might be said that this form of ceremony could fall into the realm of genuine charity, bearing in mind that \"charity begins at home\". The third motivating force is that of destruction. This i s a ceremony used for anger, annoyance, disdain, contempt, or just plain hate. It is known as a hex, curse, or destroying agent. One of the greatest of all fallacies about the practice of ritual magic is the notion that one must believe in the powers of ma gic before one can be harmed or destroyed by them. Nothing could be farther from the truth, as the most receptive victims of curses have always been the greatest scoffers. The reason is frighteningly simple. The uncivilized tribesman is the first to"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"run to his nearest witch -doctor or shaman when he feels a curse has been placed upon him by an enemy. The threat and presence of harm is with him consciously, and belief in the power of the curse is so strong that he will take every precaution against it. Thus, through the application of sympathetic magic, he will counteract any harm that might come his way. This man is watching his step, and not taking any chances. On the other hand, the \"enlightened\" man, who doesn't place any stock in such \"superstition\", rele gates his instinctive fear of the curse to his unconscious, thereby nourishing it into a phenom e nally destructive force that will multiply with each succeeding misfortune. Of course, every time a new setback occurs, the non -believer will automatically deny any connection with the curse, especially to himself. The emphatic conscious denial of the potential of the curse is the very ingredient that will create its success, through setting -up of accident prone situations. In many instances, the victim will deny any magical significance to his fate, even unto his dying gasp - although the magician is perfectly satisfied, so long as his desired results occur. It must be remembered that it matters not whether anyone attaches any significance to your working, so lon g as the results of the working are in accordance with your will . The super -logician will always explain the connection of the magical ritual to the end result as \"coincidence\". Whether magic is performed for constructive or destructive purposes, the succe ss of the operation is dependent on the receptivity of the person who is to receive the blessing or curse, as the case may be. In the case of a sex or compassion ritual, it helps if the recipient has faith and believes in magic, but the victim of a hex or curse is much more prone to destruction if he DOES NOT believe in it! So long as man knows the meaning of fear, he will need the ways and means to defend himself against his fears. No one knows everything, and as long as there is wonder, there will always be an apprehension of the unknown, where there are potentially dangerous forces. It is this natural fear of the unknown, a first cousin to the fascination towards the unknown, that impels the man of logic towards his very explanations. Obviously, the man o f science is motivated to discovery by his very sense of wonder. And yet, how sad that this man who calls himself logical is often the last to recognize the essence of ritual magic. If religious faith can make bleeding wounds appear on the body in approxim ation to the wounds supposedly inflicted on Christ, it is called stigmata. These wounds appear as a result of compassion driven to an emotionally violent extreme. Why, then, should there be any doubt as to the destructive extremes of fear and terror. The s o-called demons have the power to destroy in a flesh rending manner, theoretically, as much as a handful of nails, long rusted away, can create blood -dripping ecstasy in a person convinced he is hooked upon the cross of Calvary. Therefore, never attempt to convince the skeptic upon whom you wish to place a curse. Allow him to scoff. To enlighten him would lessen your chance of success. Listen with benign assurance as he laughs at your magic, knowing his days are filled with turmoil all the while. If he is d espicable enough, by Satan's grace, he might even die - laughing! A WORD OF WARNING! TO THOSE WHO WOULD PRACTICE THESE ARTS - Concerning Sex or Lust: Take full advantage of spells and charms that work; if you be a man, plunge your erect member into her wi th lascivious delight; if you be a woman, open wide your loins in lewd anticipation."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Concerning Compassion: Be resolved that you'll have no regrets at the expense of the help that you have given others, should their new - found blessings place an obstacle i n your path. Be grateful for things that come to you through the use of magic. Concerning Destruction: Be certain you DO NOT care if the intended victim lives or dies, before you throw your curse, and having caused their destruction, revel, rather than fe el remorse. HEED WELL THESE RULES - OR IN EACH CASE YOU WILL SEE A REVERSAL OF YOUR DESIRES WHICH WILL HARM, RATHER THAN HELP, YOU! "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE RITUAL, OR \"INTELLECTUAL DECOMPRESSION\", CHAMBER A MAGICAL ceremony may be performed by oneself or in a group, but the advantages of each should be made clear. A group ritual is certainly much more of a reinforcement of faith, and an instillation of power, than is a private ceremony. The massing together of persons who are dedicated to a common philosophy is bound to insure a renewal of confidence in the power of magic. The pageantry of religion consistently becomes a solitary situation it reaches into that realm of self -den i al which runs concurrent with anti -social behavior. It is for this reason that the Satanist should attempt to seek out others with whom to engage in these ceremonies. In the case of a curse or destruction ritual, it sometimes helps the magician if his desires are intensified by other members of the group. There is nothing in this type of ceremony which would lead to embarrassment on the part of those conducting a ritual of this sort, since anger and the symbolic destruction of the intended victim are the essential ingredients. On the other hand, a compassion ritual, with its unashamed shedding of tears, or a sex ritual, with its masturbatory and orgasmic overtones, would most likely succeed best if privately performed. There is no place for self -consciousness in the ritual chamber, unless that very self - consciousness is an integral part of the role being played, and can be used to good advantage - i.e.: the shame felt by a prudent woman serving as an altar, who, through her embarrassment, feels sexual stimulation. Even in a totally personalized ritual, however, the standardized preliminary invocatio ns and devices should be employed before the intimate fantasies and acting out occur. The formal part of the ritual can be performed in the same room or chamber as the personalized working - or, the formal ceremony in one place, the personal in another. Th e beginning and end of the ritual must be conducted within the confines of the ritual chamber containing the symbolic devices (altar, chalice, etc.). The formalized beginning and end of the ceremony acts as a dogmatic, anti -intellectual device, the purpose of which is to disassociate the activities and frame of reference of the outside world from that of the ritual chamber, where the whole will must be employed. This facet of the ceremony is most important to the intellectual, as he especially requires the \"decompression chamber\" effect of the chants, bells, candles, and other trappings, before he can put his pure and willful desires to work for himself, in the projection and utilization of his imagery. The \"intellectual decompression chamber\" of the Satanic temple might be considered a training school for temporary ignorance, as are ALL religious services! The difference is that the Satanist KNOWS he is practicing a form of contrived ignorance in order to expand his will, whereas another religionist doesn't - or if he does know, he practices that form of self - deceit"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"which forbids such recognition. His ego is already too shaky from his religious inculcation to allow himself to admit to such a thing as self - imposed ignorance! "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE INGREDIENTS USED IN THE PER FORMANCE OF SATANIC MAGIC A. Desire T HE first ingredient in the performance of a ritual is desire, otherwise known as motivation, temptation, or emotional persuasion. If you do not truly desire any end result, you should not attempt to perform a workin g. There is no such thing as a \"practice\" working, and the only way that a magician could do \"tricks\" such as moving inanimate objects, would be to have a strong emotional need to do so. It is true that if the magician wishes to gain power through impressi ng others with his feats of magic, he must produce tangible proof of his ability. The Satanic concept of magic, however, fails to find gratification in the proving of magical prowess. The Satanist performs his ritual to insure the outcome of his desires, a nd he would not waste his time nor force of will on something so inconclusive as r olling a pencil off a table, etc. through the application of magic. The amount of energy needed to levitate a teacup (genuinely) would be of sufficient force to place an idea in a group of people's heads half -way across the earth, in turn, motivating them in accordance with your will. The Satanist knows that even if you succeeded in lifting the teacup from the table, it would be assumed that trickery was used anyway. Therefore , if the Satanist wants to float objects in mid -air, he uses wires, mirrors, or other devices, and saves his force for self -aggrandizement. All \"gifted\" mediums and white -light mystics practice pure and applied stage magic, with their blindfolds and sealed envelopes, and any fairly competent stage magician, carnival worker, or lodge -hall entertainer can duplicate the same effect - although lacking, perhaps, the sanctimonious \"spiritual\" overtones. A little child learns that if he wishes for something hard e nough, it will come true. This is meaningful. Wishing indicates desire, whereas prayer is accompanied by apprehension. Scripture has twisted desire into lust, covetousness, and greed. Be as a child, and do not stifle desire, lest you lose touch with the fi rst ingredient in the performance of magic. Be led into temptation, and take that which tempts, whenever you can! "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE INGREDIENTS USED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SATANIC MAGIC B. Timing I N every successful situation, one of the most important ingredien ts is the proper timing. In the performance of a magical ritual, timing can mean success or failure to an even greater extent. The best time to cast your spell or charm, hex or curse, is when your target is at his most receptive state. Receptivity to the w ill of the magician is assured when the recipient is as passive as possible. No matter how strong -willed one is, he is naturally passive while he is asleep; therefore, the best time to throw your magical energy towards your target is when he or she sleeps. There are certain periods of the sleep cycle that are better than others for susceptibility to outside influences. When a person is normally fatigued from a day's activities, he will \"sleep like a log\" until his mind and body are rested. This period of pr ofound sleep usually lasts about four to six hours, after which the period of \"dream sleep\" occurs which lasts two or three hours, or until awakening. It is during this \"dream sleep\" that the mind is most receptive to outside or unconscious influence. Let us assume the magician wishes to cast a spell on a person who would usually retire at 11 o'clock in the evening, and rise at 7 o'clock in the morning. The most effective time to perform a ritual would be about 5 o'clock in the morning, or two hours before the recipient awakens. It is to be emphasized that the magician must be at his peak of efficiency, as he represents the \"sending\" factor when he performs his ritual. Traditionally speaking, witches and sorcerers are night people, and understandably so. Wha t better schedule on which to live, for the sending of thoughts towards unsuspecting sleepers! If only people were aware of the thoughts injected into their minds while they slept! The dream state is the birthplace of much of the future. Great thoughts are manifest upon awakening, and the mind that retains, in conscious form, these thoughts, shall produce much. But he who is guided by thoughts unrecognized is led into situations that will later be interpreted as \"fate\", \"God's will\", or accident. There are other times in each person's day that lend themselves to the receiving of the will of the wizard. Those times when day -dreaming or boredom ensue, or when time hangs heavy, are fertile periods of suggestibility. If a woman is the target for your spell, do n ot forget the importance of the menstrual cycle. If man were not dulled through his stifling evolutionary development, he would know, as an all - fours animal knows, when the female was most sexually inclined. Man's snout, however unsullied by cheap opiates, is not normally equipped to ferret out such tell -tale erotic scents. Even if he were so endowed with such olfactory powers, the object of his quest would most likely \"throw him off the scent\" through the use of massive doses of perfumery to cover and smot her the \"offending\" effluvium, or eliminate detection completely, by the astringent action of powerful deodorants."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Despite these discouraging factors, man is still motivated to desire or be repelled, as the case may be, by his unconscious recognition of th e change in woman's body chemistry. This is accomplished in the form of a sensory cue, which is olfactory in its nature. To go backwards, in what would amount to a return to the all -fours animal, would seem to be the best exercise for the conscious applica tion of these powers, but to the squeamish might smack of lycanthropy. There is, however, an easier way, and that is to simply ascertain the dates and frequency of the menstrual cycle of the woman who is your target. It is immediately before and after the period itself that the average woman is most sexually approachable. Therefore, the magician will find the sleep period during these times most effective for the instillation of thoughts or motivations of a sexual nature. Witches and sorceresses have a much greater range of time in which to cast their spells toward the men of their choice. Bec a use man is more consistent in his sexual drives than woman (although there are many women with equal or even greater lusts), day to day timing is not as important. Any man who is not already drained of all sexual energy is a \"sitting duck\" for the proficient witch. The time of the year following the spring equinox is the most fraught with sexual vigor in a man, and he asserts himself accordingly; but the witch, in turn, must work her magic stronger, as she will find his eyes will stray. Should the fearful ask, \"Is there no defense against such witchery?\" it must be answered thus - \"Yes, there is protection. You must never sleep, never daydream, never be without a vital thought, and never have an open mind. Then you shall be protected from the forces of magic.\" "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE INGREDIENTS USED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SATANIC MAGIC C. Imagery T HE adolescent boy who takes great care in carving, on a tree, a heart containing his and his love object's initials; the little chap who sits by the hour drawing his conception of sleek automobiles; the tiny girl who rocks a scuffed and ragged doll in her arms, and thinks of it as her beautiful little baby - these capable witches and warloc ks, these natural magicians, are employing the magical ingredient known as imagery, and the success of any ritual depends on it. Children, not knowing or caring if they possess artistic skill or other creative talents, pursue their goals through the use of imagery of their own manufacture, whereas \"civilized\" adults are much more critical of their own creative efforts. This is why a \"primitive\" magician can utilize a mud doll or crude drawing to successful advantage in his magical ceremonies. To HIM , the im age is as accurate as needs be. Anything which serves to intensify the emotions during a ritual will contribute to its success. Any drawing, painting, sculpture, writing, photograph, article of clothing, scent, sound, music, tableau, or contrived situation that can be incorporated into the ceremony will serve the sorcerer well. Imagery is a constant reminder, an intellect -saving device, a working substitute for the real thing. Imagery can be manipulated, set up, modified, and created, all according to the w ill of the magician, and the very blueprint that is created by imagery becomes the formula which leads to reality. If you wish to enjoy sexual pleasures with the one of your choice, you must create the situation you desire on paper, canvas, by the written word, etc., in as overstated a way as possible, as an integral part of the ceremony. If you have material desires, you must gaze upon images of them - surround yourself with the smells and sounds conducive to them - create a lodestone which will attract th e situation or thing that you wish! To insure the destruction of an enemy, you must destroy them by proxy! They must be shot, stabbed, sickened, burned, smashed, drowned, or rent in the most vividly convincing manner! It is easy to see why the religions of the right -hand path frown upon the creation of \"graven images\". The imagery used by the sorcerer is a working mechanism for material reality, which is totally opposed to esoteric spirituality. A Greek gentleman of magical persuasion once wanted a woman wh o would satisfy his every desire, and so obsessed with the unfound object of his dreams was he, that he went about constructing such a wonderful creature. His work completed, he fell so convincingly and irrevocably in love with the woman he had created tha t she was no longer stone, but mortal flesh, and alive and warm; and so the magus, Pygmalion, received the greatest of magical"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"benedictions, and the beautiful Galatea was his. THE INGREDIENTS USED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SATANIC MAGIC D. Direction O NE of the most overlooked ingredients in the working of magic is the accumulation and subsequent direction of force toward an effective end. Altogether too many would -be witches and warlocks will perform a ritual, and then go about with tremendous anxiety wa iting for the first sign of a successful working. For all intent and purpose, they might as well get down on their knees and pray, for their very anxiety in waiting for the desired results only nullifies any real chance of success. Furthermore, with this a ttitude, it is doubtful that enough concentrated energy to even perform a proper ceremony could be stored up in the first place. To dwell upon or constantly complain about the situation upon which your ritual would be based only guarantees the weakening of what should be ritualistically directed force, by spreading it thin and diluting it. Once the desire has been established strongly enough to employ the forces of magic, then every attempt must be made to symbolically give vent to these wishes IN THE PERFO RMANCE OF THE RITUAL - NOT before or after! The purpose of the ritual is to FREE the magician from thoughts that would consume him, were he to dwell upon them constantly. Contemplation, daydreaming and constant scheming burns up emotional energy that could be gathered together in a dynamically usable force; not to mention the fact that normal productivity is severely depleted by such consuming anxiety. The witch who casts her spells between long waits by the telephone, anticipating her would - be lover's call ; the destitute warlock who invokes Satan's blessing, then waits on pins and needles for the check to arrive; the man, saddened by the injustices wrought upon him, who, having cursed his enemy, plods his way, long of face, and f u rrowed of brow - all are common examples of misdirected emotional energy. Small wonder that the \"white\" magician fears retribution after casting an \"evil\" spell! Retribution, to the guilt -ridden sender, would be assured, by their very conscience -stricken state! "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE INGREDIENTS USED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SATANIC MAGIC E. The Balance Factor T HE Balance Factor is an ingredient employed in the practice of ritual magic which applies to the casting of lust and compassion rituals more than in the throwing of a curse. This ingredien t is a small, but extremely important one. A complete knowledge and awareness of this factor is an ability few witches and warlocks ever attain. This is, simply, knowing the proper type of individual and situation to work your magic on for the easiest and best results. Knowing one's own limitations is a rather odd bit of introspection, it would seem, for a person who should be able to perform the impossible; but under many conditions it can make the difference between success and failure. If, in attempting to attain your goal through either greater or lesser magic, you find yourself failing consistently, think about these things: Have you been the victim of a misdirected, over - blown ego which has caused you to want something or someone when the chances are virtually non -existent? Are you a talentless, tone -deaf individual who is attempting, through magic, to receive great acclaim for your unmusical voice? Are you a plain, glamorless witch with oversized feet, nose, and ego, combined with an advanced case of a cne, who is casting love spells to catch a handsome young movie star? Are you a gross, lumpy, lewd -mouthed, snaggle -toothed loafer who is desirous of a luscious young stripper? If so, you'd better learn to use the balance factor, or else expect to fail con sistently! To be able to adjust one's wants to one's capabilities is a great talent, and too many people fail to realize that if they are unable to attain the maximum, \"a half a loaf can be better than none\". The chronic loser is always the man who, having nothing, if unable to make a million dollars, will reject any chance to make fifty thousand with a disgruntled sneer. One of the magician's greatest weapons is knowing himself; his talents, abilities, physical attractions and detractions, etc., and when, where, and with whom to utilize them! The man with nothing to offer, who approaches the man who is successful with grandiose advice and promise of great wealth, has the alacrity of the flea climbing up the elephant's leg with the intention of rape! The asp iring witch who deludes herself into thinking that a powerful enough working will always succeed, despite a magical imbalance, is forgetting one essential rule: MAGIC IS LIKE NATURE ITSELF , AND SUCCESS IN MAGIC REQUIRES WORKING IN HARMONY WITH NATURE , NOT AGAINST IT .

W hen more than one person is involved in the ceremony, one of them must act as priest. In a private ritual the sole performer follows the instructions for the priest. 4. Whenever the words \"Shemhamforash!\" and \"Hail Satan!\" are spoken by the person acting as priest, the other participants will repeat the words after him. The gong is struck following the other participants' response to \"Hail Satan!\" 5. Conversing (except within the context of the ceremony) and smoking are prohibited after the bell is rung at the beginning, until after it is again rung at the end of the ritual. 6.

Then, fashion whatever imagery you possibly can that will parallel in as exact a way possi ble the situation towards which you strive. Remember, you have five senses to utilize, so do not feel you must limit your imagery to one. Here are devices that may be employed (either alone, or in any combination): a. graphic imagery such as drawings, paintin gs, etc. b. written imagery such as stories, plays, descriptions of desires and eventual outcome of same. c. acting out the desire in tableau or playet, either as yourself or portraying the role of the object of your desire (transference), using any devices ne cessary to intensify imagery. d. any odors relative to the desired person or situation. e. any sounds or background noises conducive to a strong image. Intense sexual feeling should accompany this step of the ritual, and after sufficient imagery is obtained, as strong an orgasm as is possible should serve as climax to this step. This climax should be attained using any masturbatory or auto - erotic means necessary. After orgasm is obtained, return to the location of the altar and proceed with step #11. (B) To I nsure Help Or Success For One Who Has Your Sympathy Or Compassion (Including Yourself) Remain in close proximity of the altar and with as vivid a mental image as possible of the person you wish to help (or intense self - pity), state your desire in your own terms.

DEVICES USED IN A SATANIC RITUAL CLOTHING Black robes are worn by the male participants. The robes may be cowled or ho oded, and if desired may cover the face. The purpose in covering the face is to allow the participant freedom to express emotion in the face, without concern. It also lessens distraction on the part of one participant towards another. Female participants w ear garments which are sexually suggestive; or all black clothing for older women. Amulets bearing the sigil of Baphomet or the traditional pentagram of Satan are worn by all participants. Robes are donned by men before entering the ritual chamber, and are worn throughout the ritual. Men may substitute all black clothing for black robes. Black is chosen for the attire in the ritual chamber because it is symbolic of the Powers of Darkness. Sexually appealing clothing is worn by women for the purpose of stimu lating the emotions of the male participants, and thereby intensifying the outpouring of adrenal or bio - electrical energy which will insure a more powerful working. ALTAR Man's earliest altars were living flesh and blood; and man's natural instincts and p redil e ctions were the foundation on which his religions were based. Later religions, in making man's natural inclinations sinful, perverted his living altars into slabs of stone and lumps of metal. Satanism is a religion of the flesh, rather than of the sp irit; therefore, an altar of flesh is used in Satanic ceremonies. The purpose of an altar is to serve as a focal point towards which all attention is focused during a ceremony. A nude woman is used as the altar in Satanic rituals because woman is the natur al passive receptor, and represents the earth mother. In some rituals nudity for the woman serving as altar may be impractical, so she may be clothed or partially covered. If a female is performing the ritual alone, no woman need be used for the altar. If no female is used for the altar, the elevated plane used for her to lie upon may be used to hold other devices for the ritual. For large group rituals a trapezoidal altar about 3 to 4 feet high and 5½ to 6 feet long can be specially constructed for the wom an to lie upon. If this is impractical, or in private ceremonies, any elevated plane may be used. If a"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"woman is used for the altar, the other devices may be placed upon a table within easy reach of the priest. SYMBOL OF BAPHOMET The symbol of Baphomet was used by the Knights Templar to represent Satan. Through the ages this symbol has been called by many different names. Among these are: The Goat of Mendes, The Goat of a Thousand Young, The Black Goat, The Judas Goat, and perhaps the most appropriately, Th e Scapegoat. Baphomet represents the Powers of Darkness combined with the generative fertility of the goat. In its \"pure\" form the pentagram is shown encompassing the figure of a man in the five points of the star - three points up, two pointing down - sym bolizing man's spiritual nature. In Satanism the pentagram is also used, but since Satanism represents the carnal instincts of man, or the opposite of spiritual nature, the pentagram is inverted to perfectly acco m modate the head of the goat - its horns, rep resenting duality, thrust upwards in defiance; the other three points inverted, or the trinity denied. The Hebraic figures around the outer circle of the symbol which stem from the magical teachings of the Kabala, spell out \"Leviathan\", the serpent of the watery abyss, and identified with Satan. These figures correspond to the five points of the inverted star. The symbol of Baphomet is placed on the wall above the altar. CANDLES The candles used in Satanic ritual represent the light of Lucifer - the bearer of light, enlightenment, the living flame, burning desire, and the Flames of the Pit. Only black and white candles are to be used in Satanic ritual. Never use more than one white candle; but as many black candles as are required to illuminate the ritual c hamber may be used. At least one black candle is placed to the left of the altar, representing the Powers of Darkness and the left -hand path. Other black candles are placed where needed for illumination. One white candle is placed to the right of the altar , representing the hypocrisy of white light \"magicians\" and the followers of the right -hand path. No other light source is to be used. Black candles are used for power and success for the participants of the ritual, and are used to consume the parchments o n which blessings requested by the ritual participants are written. The white candle is used for destruction of enemies. Parchments upon which curses are written are burned in the flame of the white candle. BELL The shattering effect of the bell is used t o mark both the beginning and the end of the ritual. The priest rings the bell nine times, turning counter clockwise and directing the tolling"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"towards the four cardinal points of the compass. This is done once at the beginning of the ritual to clear and pu rify the air of all external sounds, and once again at the end of the ritual to intensify the working and act as a pollutionary indicating finality. The tonal quality of the bell used should be loud and penetrating, rather than soft and tinkling. CHALICE In Satanic ritual the chalice or goblet used represents the Chalice of Ecstasy. Ideally, the chalice should be made of silver, but if a silver chalice can not be obtained, one made from another metal, glass, or crockery may be used - anything but gold . Gol d has always been associated with white - light religions and the Heavenly Realm. The chalice is to be drunk from first by the priest, then by one assistant. In private rituals the person performing the ceremony drains the chalice. ELIXIR The stimulating fl uid or Elixir of Life used by the Pagans has been corrupted into sacramental wine by the Christian faith. Originally, the liquor used in Pagan rituals was drunk to relax and intensify the emotions of those involved in the ceremony. Satanism does not sacrif ice its god, as do other religions. The Satanist practices no such form of symbolic cannibalism, and returns the sacramental wine used by the Christians to its original purpose - that of stimulating the emotions necessary to Satanic ritual. Wine itself nee d not be used - whatever drink is most stimulating and pleasing to the palate is in order. The Elixir of Life is to be drunk from the Chalice of Ecstasy, as indicated above, immediately following the Invocation to Satan. SWORD The Sword of Power is symbol ic of aggressive force, and acts as an extension and intensifier of the arm with which the priest uses to gesture and point. A parallel to this is the pointing stick or blasting wand used in other forms of magical ritual. The sword is held by the priest an d is used to point towards the symbol of Baphomet during the Invocation to Satan. It is also used, as indicated in Steps of Ritual , when calling forth the four Princes of Hell. The priest thrusts the point of the sword through the parchment containing the message or request after it has been read aloud; it is then used to hold the parchment while introduced into the candle flame. While hearing the requests of other participants, and while repeating same, the priest places the sword atop their heads (in trad itional \"knighting\" fashion). For private rituals, if a sword cannot be obtained, a long knife, cane, or similar staff may be used."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" PHALLUS The phallus is a Pagan fertility symbol which represents generation, virility, and aggre s sion. This is yet another d evice which has been blasphemously converted to fit the guild -ridden ceremonies of Christianity. The phallus is a non -hypocritical version of the aspergill u m, or \"holy water sprinkler\" used in Catholicism - quite a metamorphosis of the common penis! The ph allus is held in both hands of one of the priest's assistants, and methodically shaken twice towards each cardinal point of the compass, for the benediction of the house. Any phallic symbol may be used. If none is obtainable one may be made from plaster, w ood, clay, wax, etc. The phallus is necessary only in organized group rituals. GONG The gong is used to call upon the forces of Darkness. It is to be struck once after the participants have repeated the priest's words, \"Hail Satan!\". A gong is necessary o nly in organized group rituals. For the best tonal quality a concert gong is preferred, but if one cannot be obtained any gong with a full, rich tone may be used. PARCHMENT Parchment is used because its organic properties are compatible with the elements of nature. In keeping with the Satanic views on sacrifice, the parchment used would be made from the skin of a sheep which was, by necessity, killed for food. An animal is never slaughtered for the purpose of using all or a part of that animal in a Satanic ritual. If commer c ial parchment which has been made from already slaughtered sheep cannot be obtained, plain paper may be substituted. The parchment is the means by which the written message or request can be consumed by the candle flame and sent out into the ether. The request is written on parchment or paper, read aloud by the priest, and then burned in the flame of either the black or white candle - whichever is appropriate for the particular request. Before the ritual begins curses are placed to the ri ght of the priest, and charms or blessings are placed to the left of him.

If the magical ceremony is to employ all sensory awarenesses, then the proper sounds must be invoked. It is certainly true that \"act i ons speak louder than words\", but words become as monuments to thoughts. Perhaps the most no ticeable shortcoming in the printed magical conjurations of the past is the lack of emotion developed upon the reciting of them. An old wizard known to the author, who was once employing a self -composed invocation of great personal meaning in the light of his magical desires, ran out of words just as his ritual was moments short of its successful culmination. Aware of the necessity of keeping his emotional response generating, he quickly adlibbed the first emotion -provoking words that came to mind - a few s tanzas of a poem by Rudyard Kipling! Thus, with this final burst of glory -charged adrenalin, was he able to finalize an effective working! The invocations which follow are designed to serve as proclamations of certainty, not whining apprehension. For this reason they are devoid of shallow offerings -up and hollow charities.

"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"THE ENOCHIAN LANGUAGE AND THE ENOCHIAN KEYS T HE magical language used in Satanic ritual is Enochian, a language thought to be older than Sanskrit, with a sound grammatical and syntactical bases. It resembles Arabic in s ome sounds and Hebrew and Latin in others. It first appeared in print in 1659 in a biography of John Dee, the famous Sixteenth Century seer and court astrologer. This work, by Meric Casaubon, describes the occultist Dee's activities with his associate, Edw ard Kelly, in the art of scrying or crystal gazing. Instead of the usual crystal ball, Kelly, who was the gazer, used a many -faceted trapezohedron. The \"angels\" referred to in Kelly's first revelation of the Enochian Keys, obtained through the windows of t he crystal, are only \"angels\" because occultists to this day have lain ill with metaphysical constipation. Now the crystal clears, and the \"angels\" are seen as \"angles\" and the windows to the fourth dimension are thrown open - and to the frightened, the Ga tes of Hell. I have presented my translation of the following calls with an archaic but Satanically correct unvarnishing of the translation employed by the Order of the Golden Dawn in the late Nineteenth Century. In Enochian the meaning of the words, combi ned with the quality of the words, unite to create a pattern of sound which can cause tremendous reaction in the atmosphere. The barbaric tonal qualities of this language give it a truly magical effect which cannot be described. For many years the Enochian Keys, or Calls, have been shrouded in secrecy. The few printings that have existed completely eliminate the correct wording, as the proper translation has been disguised through the use of euphemisms, and only designed to throw the inept magician and/or w ould -be inquisitor off the track. Apocryphal as they have become (and who can tell what grim reality provokes the \"fantasy\"), the Enochian Calls are the Satanic paeans of faith. Dispensing with such once -pragmatic whitewashing in terms such as \"holy\" and \"angelic\", and arbitrarily chosen groups of numbers, the purpose of which were only to act as substitutes for \"blasphemous\" words - here, then, are the TRUE Enochian Calls, as received from an unknown hand.

Her course, let it run with the fulfillment of lust; and as an handmaiden, let her serve them. One season, let it confound another; and let there be no creature upon or within her the same. All her numbers, let them differ in their qualities; and let there be no creature equal with another.

Flowers, Ph.D., V° Temple of Set from Lords of the Left-Hand Path Runa-Raven Press, Sm ithville, Texas, 1997 Essential to the nature of the myth of any figur e such as Anton LaVey are the influences which shaped that figure’s thought and action. LaVey hims elf provided a core list of such influences on his thought on the dedication page of the original printings of his Satanic Bible . It is telling that in more recent printings of the book this page has been omitted. On that list appear 19 primary personages, with 20 more given a sort of “honorable mention”. 1 There is also one animal, Togare, LaVey’s fa mous pet lion, and the Nine Unknown Men. [Almost 70 other names appeared in a similar list in his Satanic Rituals book. These too have been removed in recent printings.] Space does not permit me to di scuss each one of these personages in any detail, but the primary list is extremely important to understanding LaVey’s Satanic philosophy. The 19 primary men are (in the order he listed them): Bernardino Logara, Karl Haushofer, Grigory Yefimovitch Rasputin, Sir Basil Zaharoff, Allesandro Cagliostro, Barnabas Saul, Ragnar Redbeard, William Mortensen, Hans Brick, Max Rei nhardt, Orrin Klapp, Fritz Lang, Friedrich Nietzsche, William Claude Dukinfield, Phineas Taylor Barnum, Hans Poelzig, Reginald Marsh, Wilhelm Reich, and Mark Twain. After the names of each of these, LaVey characterizes them with a dedicatory phrase. These are given in quot ation marks in the discussions below. Bernadino Logara, “who knew the value of m oney”, unidentified, presumably a manipulative banker or financier. Karl Haushofer (1869-1946), “a teacher without a classroom”, was the founder of the theory of “geopolitics” and a professor of geography at the University of Munich. He was sympathetic with National Socialism and exerted influence on its id eology, especially throu gh one of his students, Rudolf Hess. However LaVey’s image and admiration of him comes through the modem mythologizing contained in The Morning of the Magicians , in which the authors have Haushofer involved in various occult goings-on in Tibet and with the infamous Thule Gesellschaft of Rudolf von Sebottendorf. There is, however, no evidence for these more “occultnik” connections. Rasputin (1872-1916), “who knew the magic of a child”, was much admired by LaVey because he saw the Russian “mad monk” as a lusty manipul ator of people (especially women) and power - all traits pursued by LaVey himself. But Rasputin was not likely to have had anything really “Satanic” about him. LaVey was mo st certainly inspired by more lu rid accounts of Rasputin - and by the film Rasputin: The Mad Monk (Hammer, 1965). Sir Basil Zaharoff (1850-1936), “a gentleman”, was an arms merchant who sold weaponry and encouraged his customers to use their purchases -all while not only beco ming wealthy but being knighted by the King of England too! __________________________ 1 The “secondary” dedication names: Howard Hughes, Ja mes Moody (CS member), Marcello Truzzi (Sociology professor), Adrian-Claude Frazier (real name Charles Steenbarger, CS), Marilyn Monroe, Wesley Mather (CS), William Lindsay Gresham, Hugo Zacchin i (“Human Cannonball” circus perfor mer), Jayne Mansfield, Frederick Goerner, C.Huntley (CS), Nathaniel West , Horatio Alger [the juxtaposition of these two is intentionally ironic, since West in A Cool Million satirized Alger], Robert E.

He billed himself as a “Count” and the “Grand Kophta of the Egyptian Lodge”, but what was less known was that he had been expelled from several countries due to his fraudulent dealings. He was popular with the peop le and a supporter of revolution, but ended his life in the dungeons of Pope Pius VI. Barnabas Saul was the first “s cryer”, or medium, employed by the Elizabethan mage John Dee (1527-1608). After leaving Dee’s servi ce, Saul disavowed his visions. Ragnar Redbeard (1842?-1926?), “whose might is right ”, is a story unto himself. “Redbeard” was perhaps the pseudonym of Arthur Desmond, an at heist and social Darwin ist street-philosopher from whose book, entitled Might is Right LaVey lifted whole sections to create the “Book of Satan” portion of the Satanic Bible. William Mortensen, “who looked ... and saw”, wrote a photographers’ manual entitled The Command to Look (1937). The psycho-optical theo ries contained in it gr eatly influenced LaVey’s approach to art and to images and the way th ey can influence the human mind. It must be considered a keystone to LaVeyan Satanism. Hans Brick, “who knows the law”, wrote a book entitled The Nature of the Beast (1960) which was a formative influence on the formulation of La Vey’s social philosophy, especially as contained in the Lex Talonis or “Eleven Rules of the Earth”. Max Reinhardt (1873-1943), “a builder of dreams”, was born Max Goldman in Austria and became famous as a theatrical director who specialized in staging huge spectacles. Orrin Klapp (b. 1915), “the walking ma n”, is a sociologist whose works Heroes, Villains and Fools (1962) and The Collective Search for Identity (1969) were greatly influential on LaVey’s ideas of social movements and change. Fritz Lang (1890-1976), “who made m oving blueprints”, was an Au strian film director who made such classics as Metropolis (1926) and M (1930). Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), “a realist”, was a German philo sopher and forerunner to the existentialists. His ideas of the overman (or “superman”) and the “will to power”, as well as his ideas concerning the existence of natural “maste rs” and ”slaves”, are greatly admired by modern philosophical Satanists. W.C. Fields (1880-1946), “who saved me a journe y to Tibet”, was the stage-name of William C. Dukinfield. P.T. Barnum (1810-1891), “another great guru”, was the American showman famous for his exhibits of freaks and establishm ent of circuses. Barnum’s supposed basic philosophy - “There’s a sucker born every minute” -was take n to heart by LaVey and used as a mainstay of his worldview. Hans Poelzig (1869-1936), “who kne w all the angles”, was a Germ an architect who specialized in grandiose and imaginative structures. An exampl e is the Grand Theater in Berlin, also called the Max Reinhardt Theater (1919). He was also the set designer for The Golem (Deutsche Bioscop, 1914). Reginald Marsh (1898-1954), “a grea t artist”, was an illustrator, scene designer, and painter of gritty street scenes, greatly admired by LaVey, who is himself a painter of unusual subjects. Wilhelm Reich (1897-1957), “who knew more than cabinet making”, was a German psychologist who held that there was a material force called “orgone” whic h worked in conjunction with the human orgasm. This force could also be collected in “cabinets” called “orgone accumulators”. Mark Twain (1835-1910), “a very brave man” , was the pen name of Samuel Langhorn Clemens, the great American writer. La Vey much admires Twain for his works Letters from the Earth (1962) and The Mysterious Stranger (1969). In an early Church of Satan document, LaVey praises Twain as “one of the greatest of the Dev il’s advocates in history” and as “the most noble embodiment of the Satanist”. This list of influences provides invaluable insi ght into the formation of LaVey’s philosophy and outlook on life. Of the 16 identifiable men fully half of them are artists of one kind or another. Of these, five dealt with the creati on of visual imagery and two, W.C. Fields and P.T. Barnum, were best known as “trickster” fi gures. The idea lization of image makers should provide some clue as to the true nature of LaVey’s philosophy and magic."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"That most of LaVey’s ideas are not original, a nd that his philosophy is la rgely made up of bits and pieces of the philosophies of others which he recomposed according to his own tastes and style - unique to himself and to his time - might also be said of some of the other subjects in Lords of the Left-Hand Path . We could say the same of every one w ho ever created a religion, whether Gautama the Buddha or Gerald Gardner. What makes LaVey somewhat unusual in this respect is that he often seems to insist on the idea that he invented a way of thinking, that his Satanism is something akin to a product upon which he has a “copyright” of some sort. But more remarkable than the idea that LaVey invented his Satanism out of bits and pieces of obscure philosophies is the fact that he actually invented himself out of the depths of his own mind ..."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Fragments of an Anton Szandor LaVey Reading List Mostly culled from a late 1980s Temple of Set reading list and The Compleat Witch’s bibli ography; text in quotes is ASL LaVey’s Works The Satanic Bible by Anton Szandor LaVey.

Much of the material in the monograph was later expanded into a se ries of twenty essays issued to Satanists as a study course. Both the original monograph and the essays derived from it were discontinued prior to the 1970 publication of th e Satanic Bible because of that volume ’s incorporation of the essays in its “Books of Lucifer” and “Belial”. This m onograph, then, may be considered the original manifesto of the Church of Satan and hence it s founding statement of principles. - M.A.A. The Nine Satanic Statements 1 Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence! 2 Satan represents vital existence in stead of spiritual pipe dreams! 3 Satan represents undefiled wisdom in stead of hypocritical self-deceit! 4 Satan represents kindness to those who deserv e it instead of love wasted on ingrates! 5 Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek! 6 Satan represents responsibility to the responsib le instead of concern for psychic vampires! 7 Satan represents man as just another animal - sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his “divine spiritual and in tellectual development,” has become the most vicious animal of all! 8 Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as th ey all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification! 9 Satan has been the best friend the Church has ev er had, as he has kept it in business all these years! Part I: Foreword In writing this monograph it is our intent to give you a basic unders tanding of the Satanic religion. Therefore we have attempted to present this to you in a form which will be easily understood. We fully realize that many of you who will read this bookl et will not be novices to the basics of Satanism or the fundamentals of psychology which make up a large part of the Satanic philosophy. We are aware that to many of you pa rt of the information herein is elementary. Therefore it is to be understood that there is no attempt on our part to be condescending to t hose to whom some of this information is already known. We realize, however, that probably many more of you know comparatively little about Satanism, except what little you have been able to decipher from the reams of ponderous material which is shrouded in so much esoteric jargon as to make it virtually usele ss to neophytes in Satanic theology. It is with this in mi nd that we have avoided delving into the finer points of Satanic thought and ritual magic. A complete statement of the tenets of Satanism and an explanation of the ceremonies and detailed instructions on sa me are available to our members. In the past the only writings on Satanism were those done by other religions as a means of propaganda to turn people agains t it, or by uninformed journalists who were influenced by the Judæo-Christian society surrounding them. Therefor e the information contained in such writings was either completely false or sensationalized. Our purpose is to enlighten you as to the true co ncepts of Satanism and to refute the myths attached to it. The “seven deadly sins” of the Christian church are greed, pride, envy, ange r, gluttony, lust, and sloth. Satanism advocates indulging in each of these “sins”, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification. A Satanist feels there is nothing wrong w ith being greedy, as it only means that he wants more than he already has. Envy s imply means to look with favor upon the possessions of others and to be desirous of obtaining sim ilar things for oneself. Envy and greed are the"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"motivating forces of ambition, and without amb ition very little of any importance would be accomplished. Gluttony is simply eating more than you need to keep yourself alive. When you have over-eaten to the point of obesity, you will oftentimes resort to another sin -pride - to regain an appearance which will return your self-respect. Anyone who buys an article of clothing for a purpose other than covering his body and keeping off the elements is guilty of pride. You may encounter scoffers who maintain that labels are not necessary. You might fi nd it an ego-satisfying little exercise to point out to these people that one or many articles that they are wearing are not necessary to keep them warm. There is not a person on this earth who is completely devoid of all ornamentation. You can inform the person that any ornamentation of hi s body shows that he too is guilty of pride. Regardless of how verbose he may be in his intelle ctual description of how free he is, he is still wearing the elements of pride. This thought may serve no other purpose for you than that of being a satisfying exercise in ab use of non-Satanists. Being reluctant to get up in the morning is to be guilty of sloth; and if you lie in bed long enough, you may find yourself indulging in yet another sin - lust. To have the faintest stirring of sexual desire is to be guilty of lust. In order to en sure the propagation of hu manity, nature made lust the second most powerful instinct, the first being self-preservati on. Realizing this, the Christian church made fornication the “original sin”. In this way it made certain that no one would escape sin. Your very state of being is as a result of sin - the original sin! The strongest instinct of every livi ng creature is self-preservation, which brings us to the last of the “seven deadly sins” -anger. Is it not our se lf-preservation instinct which is aroused when someone harms us and we become angry enough to protect ourselves from further attack? A Satanist practices the motto: “If a man smite thee on one cheek, smash him on the other!” Let no wrong go unredressed. Be as a lion in the path; be dangerous even in defeat! Since man’s natural instincts lead him to sin, al l men are sinners; and all sinners go to Hell. If everyone goes to Hell, then you will meet all of your friends there. Heaven must be populated by some very strange creatures if all they live for is to go to a place where they can strum harps for eternity. We have been told that Hell is a terrible place consisting of a huge lake of fire. Pleasure, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. Christia n missionaries were very unsuccessful in Alaska because, to an Eskimo who knows nothing other than freezing weather, a perpet ual lake of fire is very inviting. To the distress of the missionaries, the Eskimos asked, “How do we get there?” Hell has always been the mold from which Heaven has been cast. Heaven or Paradise, to most people, represents a vision of having their desires fulfilled ... these very desires being those which, if practiced during their earth ly lives, would certainly have sent them to Hell! Life is an indulgence, death an abstinence. For a person who is sati sfied with his earthly existence, life is like a party, and no one likes to leave a good party. Similarly if a person is enjoying himself here on earth, he will not so readily give up his life for the promise of an afterlife about which he knows nothing. In most religions death is touted as a beautiful , spiritual awakening. This is very appealing to one who has not had a satisfactory life. But to thos e who have experienced a ll of the joys that life has to offer, there is a great dread a ttached to dying. This is as it should be. It is this lust for life that will allow the vital person to live on after th e inevitable death of his fleshly shell. The only time an animal will resort to suicide is if he is in such pa in or life is so unbearable that death comes as an indulgence rather than an abstin ence. Suicide is considered a sin. It is rather curious that the only time death, fo r a human being, is considered si nful is when it comes as an indulgence. The four principal devils are: Leviathan, representing the sea; Lucifer, the lord of the air or bearer of light; Belial, th e lord of the earth; and Sa tan, lord of the fire. One of the main goals of the Church of Satan is to build pleasure domes in which the members of the Church can indulge themselves in their personal desires. By having a place where they can go to release their desires, the members can l ead an unfrustrated life in the everyday world. Satanism advocates indulgence, not compulsion. Compulsion is very different from indulgence. When a person cannot control his desires and is a sl ave to these urges, they become compulsions. If a person has no proper release for his desires, th ey rapidly build up and become compulsions. A"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"pleasure dome would consist of many different room s and recreational facilities for the purpose of fulfilling each member’s personal desires. Satanism represents responsibility to the respon sible instead of concern for psychic vampires. Satanism represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of love wasted on ingrates. Psychic vampires are individuals who drain others of their vital existence. We might feel responsible to such people yet not know why. These types of persons can be found in all avenues of society. They fill no useful purpose in our lives and are neither love objects nor true friends. We must rid ourselves of these psychic vampires so that we can devote our time to the people about whom we truly care. Rituals which can be performed to rid our selves of these people will be discussed later. The Satanist believes in fulfillment of the ego. Satanism, in fact, is the only religion which advocates the intensification or the encouragement of the ego. All other relig ions on the face of the Earth are concerned only with the dissolution of man’s ego. Only if a person’s ego is sufficiently fulfilled can he afford to be kind and complimentar y to others without robbing himself of his self- respect. Braggarts are very insecu re people. We generally think of a braggart as a person with a large ego, but in reality it is his unfulfilled ego which leads to his br agging as a means of satisfying his ego. To become a Satanist one does not have to “s ell his soul to the Devil”. This concept was developed by Christianity to terrorize people so that they would not stray from the fold. It was taught that if you gave in to th e temptations of Satan and lived your life in an indulgent manner, you would have to pay Satan with your soul when you died. And what is th e soul, as religionists would have it, but a passport to ev erlasting life? People were led to believe that selling their souls to the Devil meant that they would suffer in Hell fo r the rest of eternity. Th is type of ridiculous thinking is what the Christian chur ch has used to keep its parish ioners in line. Phrases like “God- fearing” are indicative of the basis for the Christian religion. It is thr ough such fear that Christianity has been able to exist all these years. We are no longer supplicating weaklings trembli ng before an unmerciful “God” who cares not whether we live or die. It has been a popular misconception that th e Satanist does not believe in God. This is not so; but we realize that God, by whatever name he is given - or by no name at all, is only the balancing factor in nature and has little concern for any suffering which we may encounter. It has been said that the good die young. The good, by Christian standards, do die young. It is the frustration of our natural instin cts that leads to the prematur e deterioration of our bodies. When one commits a wrong in other religions, he either prays to God for forgiveness or confesses to an intermediary and asks him to pr ay to God for his sins. The Satanist feels that confessing to another human being like himsel f accomplishes nothing and is degrading. When a Satanist commits a wrong, he realiz es it is natural to make mistak es. If we are truly sorry about something, we will learn from our mistakes and not do the same thing again. There has been much sensationalism regarding the Satanic Church and its views on free love. Free love in the Satanic Church means that a pers on is free to either be faithful to one person or indulge in his sexual desires with as many others as he feels necessary to satisfy his personal needs. Satanism advocates any type of sexuality whic h properly satisfies the person’s desires, be it heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, or even asexuality if you choose - or any of the fetishes pertaining to these. To most people masochism repr esents a rejection of indulgence. We consider masochism to be an indulgence if any attempt to sway or change the person from his masochistic traits is met with resentment and/or failure. Sa tanism does not encourage orgiastic activities or extramarital affairs for those to whom they do not come naturally. Being unfaithful to one’s chosen mate would be very unnatural and detrimental to some people. To ot hers it would be frustrating to be bound sexually to one person wi thout any hope of outside se xual activity. Each person must decide for himself what form of sexual activity best suits his individual needs. To thine own self be true. Self-deceit is intolerable in the Satanic religion. There are two major holidays in the Satanic religion. These are Walpurgisnacht, which is celebrated on April 30th, and Halloween, Octobe r 31st. The solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated as holidays. On these occasions special rituals are performed, and festivities follow. Part II: Ritual Magic"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Ritual magic is a large part of the Satanic religion. The purpose in performing a ritual is to accomplish something that, by other means, could not be done. Ritual magic is a very real power. It utilizes such tools as hypnosis , telepathy, psychology, etc. The t ype of magic practiced in the Satanic Church is similar to all primitive forms of magic that have been used successfully for centuries, but which have been br ought into the contemporary worl d in a workable way that will relate to the society in which we live. A Satanic ritual is basically an emotional rath er than an intellectual performance. For this reason certain devices and dramatic effects are use d. As in stage magic, the art of misdirection is one of the most valuable tools of the ritual magician. By utilizing the following devices the ritual magician can temper his intellect ual analysis of the ritual. Therefore he can allow his emotions free reign. A nude female is used as the altar in Satanic ri tuals because she represen ts the Earth mother and is a natural passive recept or for the workings of magic. The devi ces used in a Satanic ritual are as follows: -The Chalice, symbolic of the Chalice of Ecstasy, is to be drunk from first by the Priest, then by one assistant. -The Bell is used to purify the air at the beginning of the ritual and is used as a pollutionary at the end of the ritual. -The Phallus is a pagan fertility symbol, the sym bol of generation or aggression. It is also a non- hypocritical version of the holy wate r sprinkler of other religions. Th e Phallus is used to bless the congregation. - Candles are symbolic of the light of Lucifer - the bearer of light, enli ghtenment, burning desire, and the flames of the pit. Candles should be the only light source during a ritual. - The Sword is symbolic of aggressive force, and is used as an extension a nd intensifier of the arm the Priest uses to gesture or point . A parallel to this is the pointi ng stick or blasting wand used in other forms of magical ritual. -The Gong is used to call up the Powers of Darkness. The male participants in the ritual should w ear black robes. Women should wear the most sexually appealing clothing possibl e, or all black for older women. The amulet of Baphomet is worn by all participating in the r itual. The color black represents the Powers of Darkness. Sexually appealing clothing worn by women is stimulati ng to the male members and intensifies the outpouring of adrenalin energy to en sure a more powerful working. During a Satanic ritual it is essential to su mmon up the strongest em otions that will be beneficial to the respective working. The following are examples of this: During a compassion ritual it is necessary fo r the magician to feel honest sympathy and compassion for the recipient of his working. It is us eless to attempt a ritual of this type if the magician cannot truly feel compassion for the pers on involved. It is all ve ry well and good to tell a person that you will perform a compassion ritual fo r him, but unless you have the necessary deep feelings for this person and are sympathetic to hi s situation, the ritual wi ll not be effective. We oftentimes think that we might perform a ritual for a person for whom we really have no concern; but it is a sad but true fact of magic that, if we are not intensely concerned for the person, the ritual will not work. You should be able to shed an hon est tear for this person. If this much emotion cannot be felt, it is best not to attempt this type of working. If you ar e the type of person who excuses his inability to do this by thinking “I am not that emotional” or “I ’ve never been able to cry”, then it is high time you learned how. In a hate ritual in which a curs e is to be conjured, a strong fee ling of contempt for the recipient of the curse is mandatory. In a ri tual of this sort the more vindi ctive your curse can be, the more powerful your outpouring of hate for ces will be. Love is one of the most powerful emotions known to man; the other is hate. Without being able to experience one of these emotions, you cannot fully experience the other. Therefore you must love th ose who deserve and return your love, but hate your enemies with a whole heart. Half-hearted hatred is ve ry harmful to a person’s emotional stability. When a person prays for his enemies, he is in reality bottling up hi s feelings of hatred. He still hates the person; but, being bound by the tenets of his religion, he cannot express the hatred he"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"feels. To pray for your enemies is to buy second-ha nd hate, which is of a d ecidedly inferior quality. The harboring of unwarranted guilt is very detrim ental. We have been ta ught to feel guilty for all of the things that we most na turally do. Many of us can realize intellectually that it is foolish to feel guilty for these natural acts, but to accept th is emotionally is another matter. If you cannot release yourself from guilt, th en you should learn to make it work for you. You should act upon your natural instincts and then, realizing that you cannot perform these act s without feeling guilty, revel in your guilt. This may sound like a contradict ion in terms, but guilt can often add a fillip to the senses. Adults would do well to take a lesso n from children. Children often take delight in doing something they know they are not supposed to. On e of the first laws of magic is to turn every disadvantage into an advantage. The quickest way of traveling between two points is in a straight line. If all the guilts that have been built up can be turned into advantages, then intellectual scraping of the psyche - in an attempt to cleanse it of these repressions - is eliminated. Satanism is the only religion known to man that accepts this rationale [of turning a ba d thing into a good thing] rather than that of bending over backward s to eliminate the bad thing. The Satanist shuns terms such as hope and prayer , as they are indicative of negative thinking. If we hope or pray for something to come about, we will not act in a positive way which will make it happen. The Satanist commands, rather than prays to his god. Positive thinking results in positive actions. Through positive thinking, combined with r itual, we command the forces of nature. We tell ourselves “this will be done, come Hell or high water”, and therefore it is done. Human beings have personality traits which ar e either passive or a ggressive. Passivity and aggressiveness are tamer terms for masochism and sadism. We are all made up of varying degrees of these personality types. Some of us lean more towards one or the other, but it is rare to find an individual who has equal portions of each of thes e traits. If a person is basically passive or masochistic, he would be most prof icient in the mystic or mediumis tic side of Satanism. This type of person is the most natural psychic or medium . Such persons’ very pa ssivity puts them in a position of receptivity. Since magic is based on positive force, the person who is basically aggressive or sadistic in personality traits will do well as a magician. In the field of ma gic and Satanism, both passive and aggressive people are necessary. Th e aggressive person is best su ited for sending forces, and the passive or mediumistic person is best utilized as a receptor. Generally a person with a great deal of perception is passive. It has been the popular misconception that Sata nists practice human sacrifice. There has, however, never been a clarif ication of the method used for sacrifice, or of the reasons for which a Satanist would resort to this. Wh en we sacrifice a person in a Sa tanic ritual, we do not slaughter him on the altar in a physical manne r. We simply direct our hate forces towards the deserving recipient. You must never direct a curse toward a person unless you are prepared for the ultimate consequences. There is no such thing as a mild curse. If a curse is to be eff ective, you must feel the maximum in disdain and hatred for the recipient. By sendi ng these hate forces forth, we ensure suffering on the part of the person who has dealt us an injustice. It can only be left to the victim’s environmental conditions to decide what form our retribution will take, and a measure of the person’s rottenness as to the degree he will suffer. If the recipient of the curse has redeeming qualiti es of sufficient amounts, then he will not only be saved but will be rehabilitated into a more wort hwhile person as a result of the curse. Therefore you cannot perform a working of this type and sp ecify that you want the person to suffer only a broken arm or mild illness. You must realize that death may be the final outcome of a magical working of this nature. The Satanic Church feels that fo rcing oneself to feel indiscriminate love for all is very unnatural. There has never been any great love move ment in the history of the world that has not wound up killing countless numbers of people to pr ove, we must assume, how much they loved them. Every hypocrite that ever walked the eart h has had pockets bulging with love! You cannot love everyone, and by trying to you only lessen your feelings for th e people who deserve your love. Repressed hate can lead to many physical ailments . For this reason you must periodically perform a hate ritual to rid yourself of this bottled-up hate . By choosing a deserving target for your hate forces, you cleanse yourself of these malignant em otions and are free to give your loved ones full"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"benefit of your emotions without being concerned that you may be, at times, taking your pent-up hatred out on them. There is a definite period of the day when a pers on is in a more receptive state than during other times. Assuming that the person regularly sleeps fo r eight hours, the receptive state comes in the last two hours or so before awakening. This has b een established as the period of time in which the person has the dreams he can recall most easily. This is due to the fact that the person’s body has completed its required rest; but the slow rate of metabolism keeps it dormant for a short time afterwards, producing the most receptive time during to tal sleep. This is when we receive some of our most fruitful ideas. It is the twilight period between sleep and waking. A person’s subconscious is at its most active point during this period of time. It is during this period that a telepathic communication would have the best chance of being received. To be most effective, therefore, your magical working should be performed during this twilight period. There are many herbs and spices which are used in ritual magic. The most common ingredient used in love potions is mandrake root. Just as most acts which are consid ered evil are within the law, so some of the most effective ingredients used in potions can be legally obtained. There is no need to resort to popular and/or ill egal drugs for any magical purpose. The magical language used in Satanic ritual is Enochian. Enochian is a language which is thought to be older than Sanskrit, with a sound gra mmatical and syntactical basis. It was developed into a practical translation, whic h is its current form, by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers. In Enochian the meaning of the words, combined w ith the quality of the words, unite to create a pattern of sound which can cause tremendous reac tion in the atmosphere. The barbaric tonal qualities of this language give it a truly magical effect which cannot be described. It is thought by most that all Sa tanic rituals are in the form of the Black Mass. This is a misconception. Most Satanic rituals have nothing in them which would be considered sacrilegious to another religion. One of the reasons a Black Mass would be performed in the Satanic Church would be to remove a stigma attached to the activ ities of one or several me mbers. If a person feels bound or stifled by a previous religion, a Black Mass would be performed to enable him to completely divorce himself from the lim iting factors of that past religion. A Black Mass consists of such things as saying the Lord’s Prayer backwards -interspersed with obscenities, trampling the cross underfoot or hanging it upside-dow n, desecration of the wafer or host, and similar forms of defilement or parody of the sacred cows which ma ke the religion a threat to the person involved. By reducing the awesomene ss of the religion to ridi culousness, we remove its fearsomeness. The only other circumstance in which a Black Ma ss would be performed would be one in which another religion had directly atta cked the Satanic Church. To pe rform a Black Mass just for its shock value would serve no useful purpose. The Christ ian religion is no threat to the Satanist. One might say that the Devil has kept all the religions on earth in business for many, many years. If it were not for these religions which he has allowed to flourish, Satan could not come forth now and establish his organized church, bui lt on the very episcopacy and stru cture of the existing religions. Satanism is taken up by most people not out of protest, but out of logic. Therefore the debasement of their previous re ligions is unnecessary. There are ma ny sacred cows in our current society which warrant protest as much if not more than the Christian religion. A modern-day form of the Black Mass might consist of such things as urinating on marijuana, crushing an LSD sugar cube under foot, hanging a picture of Timothy Leary or a famous Indian guru upside-down, exposing the parallel between the Hippie generati on and the “emperor’s new clothes.” These things would be far more effective to the magical workin gs of a Satanist than a typical Black Mass. The results of a magical working wi ll start to manifest themselves within thirty-six hours from the time the ritual was performed. Once the ma gical working has been performed, you must push all thoughts of hope or anxiety from your mind. You have released you r emotions and sent them out into the ether, where they can eff ect your desired results. After this there is nothing left to do but sit back and wait for the results. Anxiety only acts to lessen the effectiveness of your working. The Satanic ritual is not always confined to sinister or occult su rroundings. The true magician is adept at turning any situation he encounters into a magical working. He can manipulate his surroundings to his best advantage. A ritual which is performed for the sake of redu cing an awesome figure to a ridiculous state is"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"called a Shibboleth ritual. In this ty pe of ritual each of the particip ants chooses a pilla r of society or a type of person who is particularly awesome or i rritating to him. Each then dresses in the costume of the chosen victim. For about an hour all partic ipants communicate with one another, all the while acting out in parody what would be th e actions of the pe rsons portrayed. After this psychodrama has been performed, a so rt of kangaroo court is held, and the person acting as Priest for the ritual take s the role of Satan. In the form of Satan he questions each person individually. Each participant answers Satan’s questions in the manner in which his chosen character would answer them. Through the favorite to ols of the Devil, wile and guile, Satan exposes the character for what he is. He talks him into se lling his soul to the Devil, utilizing things which are sacred cows to the shibboleth for th e purpose of disguising his tactics. In a ritual such as this, the purpose is to ridicu le the shibboleth. In this way he will no longer be awesome to the person who has suffered in some way by his actions. The situation in which the Satanist comes in contact with th e shibboleth may be one in which he is forced to treat him in a civil or even respectful manner, but once the ritual has been pe rformed, the Satanist can laugh up his sleeve at the person. The shibboleth will sens e that he is being patronized and will no longer feel that he is capable of wielding the power that he once did over the Satanist. Part III: Magic as Practiced by the Satanic Church There are many facets of magic that can be le arned only through experience. A magus is one who has become adept in the field of ritual ma gic. There are many scholars of magic who are not capable of putting the theories which they have lear ned into practice. Others may have very little formal training in magic but may have a natura l ability to utilize the Powers of Darkness. Knowledge can be a powerful t ool, but without the common sens e to put this knowledge into practice, it is useless. Animals and small children are the most natural magi cians. They have had little or no formal training and yet are adept at bending people and situations to their will. The Satanist regards these small beings as sacred an d realizes that he can learn much from them. The Satanic Church is different from all other witchcraft or magical groups in the world today. It is unlike the white magical groups, such as th ose in which the powers of magic are supposedly used only for altruistic purposes. Nor is it a primitive group of cannibals whose membership is made up of uneducated people. The Satanic Church is the first organization of its kind whose membership consists largely of responsible, resp ectable people. Only by limiting our membership to individuals of this variety, rather than appeal ing to the lunatic fringe , can we be certain of becoming the strongest power structure in the worl d. Therefore membership in the Satanic Church is not open to everyone. Unlike othe r religions in which you go to c hurch to become a worthwhile person, in the Satanic religion you must be a wort hy person before you can come into church. Once in the Church, you can reap the re wards which you deserve. The Sa tanic Church has too much to offer to afford membership to people who are only seeking sensationalism or are of a personality makeup that would reflect upon the Satani c religion in an unfavorable way. The Satanic Church looks with disdain upon white w itchcraft groups, as we feel that altruism is sinning on the lay-away plan. It is un natural not to have the desire to gain things for yourself. This does not mean that you never do anything for a nyone else. If you do something to make someone for whom you care happy, his happiness will give you a sense of gratification. We practice a modified form of the Golden Rule. Our interpretati on of this rule is: “Do unto others as they do unto you.” If you “do unto others as you would have them do unto you” and they in turn treat you badly, it goes against human nature to continue to treat such people with consideration. You may do unto others as you would have them do unto you; but if your kindness is not returned, they should be treated with the wrath they deserve. White witchcraft groups spout the theory that, if you curse a person, it will “return to you three- fold”, “come home to roost,” or in some way “boo merang back to the curser.” This is yet another indication of the guilt-ridden philosophy held by these neo-pagan, pseudo-Christian groups. These people want to delve into witchcra ft but cannot divorce themselves from the stigma attached to it. Therefore they call themselves white magicians a nd base seventy-five pe rcent of their philosophy on the trite and hackneyed te nets of Christianity. Anyone who pretends to be intere sted in magic for reasons other than gaining personal power is"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"the worst kind of hypocrite. The Satanic Church respect s Christianity at least for being consistent in its guilt-ridden philosophy, but it can only feel contempt for people who attempt to appear emancipated from guilt by joining a witchcraft group and then practice the same basic philosophy as Christianity. White magic is supposedly only utilized for good or unselfi sh purposes; and black magic, we are told, is used only for selfish reason s. In the Satanic Church we draw no dividing line between white or black magic. Magic is magic, be it used to help or hinder. You the magician should have the ability to decide what is just and then apply the powers of magic to attain your goals. The Satanic Church combines two very paradoxical words in its ti tle. There is a definite reason for this. The word “church” is a respected and re vered term. To combine the word “church” with the outrageousness of Satan is to employ one of the most important magical formulas - the utilization of nine parts acceptability to one part outrageousness. To be a true magician you must, in all outward appearances, be accepta ble to the establishment - and then use outrageous methods to undermine a situation. This again in volves the art of misdirection. If you have an appearance of respectability a nd then present an unorthodox idea, it will be accepted much more readily than it would be if you present an appearance which does not conform to the average person’s image of respectability. For example, fi ve thousand people marching down the street dressed in outlandish costumes and wearing the badges of antagonism will only succeed in alienating themselves more strongly from the forces they desire to change. If these marchers would appear in the guise of those whom they w ould change, then the needed identification could be established and inroads gained. Human beings are very egotistical creatures. We will be much more receptive to a new idea if it is presented to us by someone who is for the most part like ourselves than we would be if it were presented by a person completely alien to us. Only by working side by side with the establishment can we create any sizable change in our society. Satanism is the only religion in which a person can “turn on” to the pleasures around him without “dropping out” of society. By “dropping out” we would only deprive ourselves of the enjoyable things that society ha s to offer. We would also limit the situations in which we coul d perform our magi cal workings. Our Christianized society cannot deny the existen ce of Satan, for to do so would require it to deny the existence of God. For that matter any attempt on the part of any religion to deny the existence of Satan, by whatever name he is calle d, would be to deny the contents of its respective scriptures."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Command to Look Stephen E. Flowers, Ph.D., V° Temple of Set Reprinted from Runes #IV-3, Order of the Trapezoid, 1986 1 In the Charter of the Order of the Trapezoid, I read that one of Anton LaVey’s primal source works for the principles underlying the Law of th e Trapezoid and hence th e Order itself, was a book by William Mortensen: The Command to Look. I had never seen nor heard of this book before, so I set out to find it. I was on the track of the Trap ezoid, which is sometimes an elusive trail. As I began looking, I soon discovered that The Command to Look was no arcane Black Book, but appeared in the University of Texas card catal og as a book on photographic techniques. My interest waned slightly. Besides, the only copy was in th e Humanities Research Cent er, which is also home to much of Aleister Crowley’s pe rsonal library. That al ways means red tape. I put off my quest for a few weeks. Weeks turned into months before I moved myse lf to take up the tra il again. After finding the right collection on the right floor, and after sitti ng through the required slid e show on how to handle rare items in the collection. After the librarian as ked “Are you sure you want to do this?”, I knew I was on to something. I was shown to a private reading room where I finally got the book - presumably dug out of some unseen vault. It was laid before me in a plex iglass “cradle”, which is to prevent damage to the tome. What did I see? There on the cover of a small book, I was confronted by the face of a baby looking like a refugee from a Norman Rockwell painting. The librarian sarcastically remarked, “Looks real interesting !” Since I had gone that far, I opened the book, I di d not now expect much. But I was very much surprised. The Command to Look is indeed a treasure trove of the Black Art, and the ideas contained in it should be made av ailable to the Order not only on historical grounds, but also on the basis of their practic al magical value. Theory Mortensen insists that the main premise of the Command to Look (CTL) is closer to pure showmanship than anything else. The formula is threefold: (1) The picture must, by its mere arrangement, make you look at it ( impact ) (2) and, having looked, see ! ( subject interest ) (3) and, having seen, enjoy !( participation ) All three of these elements must be fully activated before the artist - or magician -can be said to have successfully “commanded to look”. All three, how ever, work in such rapid succession that it is almost always effected unconsciously with regard to the viewer. Therefore th e artist must carefully formulate his images to work efficiently in all three elements. The first element - impact - is psychically coercive. Its functi on is entirely one of the shapes or patterns the viewer sees. It forces the viewer to pay attention to the image. This initial force, which Mortensen calls “the pictorial impe rative”, is the force necessary to overcome the natural inertia of attention which holds most humans in a more or less constant grip. According to Mortensen, impact is purely biological in effect. It is primarily dependent on shapes or patterns that serve as stimuli signaling danger . These fear-arousing patterns must have their psychic models stored in the forms within the “racial memory” or, to use the Jungian term, “collective unconscious” of humanity. __________________________ 1 This essay is also contained in Black Runa , a collection of Dr. Flowers’ writin gs for the Order of the Trapezoid, published by Runa-Raven Press, P.O. Box 557, Smithville, Texas 78957."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Mortensen identifies four basic types of pictorial patte rns that have the ability to cause this reaction: 1 The diagonal , e.g. the lightning bolt = something that moves swiftly with determination 2 The S-curve , e.g. the snake (something that approaches in a slithering fashion) or the curves of the body (especially fema le = “the line of beauty”) 3 Triangle combinations, e.g. a blade, sharp poi nts, or teeth (= the threat of sharpness ) 4 Compact dominant mass , e.g. large animal or trapezoid (= massive block in one’s path) Again it can not be overemphasized that these patterns are purely formal and have nothing to do with the dominant themes of the images. For ex ample, if one drew the outlines of the basic contrasts in a black and white photograph and ex amined them in a purely geometrical way, the “pictorial pattern” would be obvious. More than one category of pictorial patterning can be present in any given representation as well. The second element - subject interest -must now be able to “deliver” what the successful application of the pictorial impe rative has promised. Many images, or magicians, may command to look, and then be quite unable to hold the attention they have attracted. This is done through the actual subject of the im age, moving from the external form to the internal essence of the thing. A ccording to Mortensen, in order to hold the attention -in order to make the viewer see - he or she must at once be able to recognize something basically and essentially compelling about the subject. For all practical purposes, this recognition must occur simultaneously with the impact . Therefore the types of subject interests must have as broad an emotional appeal as possible. Mortensen cites the great showman, Cecil B. De Mille, as saying that the formula for box office success is to have a film deali ng with sex, sentiment, religion, and sport. Mortensen reduces this somewhat to three subject themes: sex , sentiment , and wonder . It is Mortensen’s contention that their compelling nature make them the most effective imagematic themes in the CTL. The sex-theme seems to dominate; it certainly does in Mortensen’s own work. In commenting on the gender of the subject of the sex-theme image, Mortensen says: “It is interesting to note that women are just as much attracted to the theme of sex when presented in the form of the female nude as men are. Their attraction in this case is vi carious, rather than dir ect. Their pleasure comes in imagining themselves placed in a situation where they would receive the same admiration that goes out to the theme of the picture.” (p. 37) The sentiment-theme is usually e ffected through the softer aspect s of sex, children, hardships of humble life, domestic life, animals, landscapes , national pride, glamour of the past, etc. The wonder-theme is quite broad and covers the areas of unknown, uncertain, mysterious things, as well as themes of the supernatural, the macabre, etc. Themes can, of course, be effectively mixed. Some permutations, such as “sex + wonder”, might be more immediately eff ective than “sex + sentiment”, but as with all forms of communication, it would seem that knowledge of one’s potential “target audien ce” is the essential variable. It should be obvious that the effective use of the CTL is largely dependent upon the æsthetic compatibility of the nature of the impact pattern and subject matter. Interesting mixtures are also possible here. The third element of the CTL-formula is participation , the element that causes the looker to experience -and thereby enjoy -what he or she is seeing. This is don e, according to Mortensen, by drawing the viewer’s attention in to the image by means of lines -g eometrical alignments - that cause a movement of those attentio n patterns in accordance with the impact and subject matter of the image. Mortensen comments that the eye of the looker will naturally move along contours and outlines, and that such geometrical guides should be provid ed by the image-maker in ways compatible with the impact lines and the subject matter. This is what he would call “confirming forms”. The image-maker must, with this third elemen t, confirm the promised subject matter after having “commanded to look” in the first place with an almost pure “shock element”."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Practice There are at least three ways to apply the principl es of the CTL (1) in th e creation of graphic or spatial images (e.g. photographs, drawings, paintings , rooms, chambers, etc.), (2) in Lesser Black Magic, and (3) in Greater Black Magic. The first application is obvious and primarily what Mortensen had in mind. The work of Edward T. Hall, e.g. The Hidden Dimension, is a valuable supplement to th e CTL in this regard. Of course the design of a Trapezoidal Working Cham ber could not ignore thes e principles either. In reading Mortensen’s book the Black Magician probably could not escape the feeling that these principles could be applied outside th e context of the graphic or spatial arts. If indeed these principles are “biological” or part of the “raci al memory”, could they not be employed when the Black Magician considers how to present himself or herself when working Lesser Black Magic? It seems that the CTL contai ns a comprehensive theory on how to get - and hold - the attention of someone on an unconscious le vel. What, then, the Black Magician does with that attention is another matter. When one looks around, however, it is clear that the CTL is being employed by a variety of individuals, both c onsciously and unconsciously, all the time. Finally the CTL can be used in Greater Black Ma gic. The Black Magician can use its principles to impress more effective images within the s ubjective universe and thereby have a greater or deeper effect in the objective universe. Also an y objective manifestation of this process - in an objective image constructed according to CTL principles -will be a more powerful tool in effecting Greater Black Magic. This is where the Law of the Trapezoid comes in. If we analyze the Seal of the Order, we will see a (Grand) Masterful applicati on of CTL principles: the “swiftly moving diagonal” at its center (the head of the tcham -scepter), the “threat of sharpness” throughout (note especially the interlockings of the numerals with the angles of the pent agram and the “W” at its nether point), and the “dominant mass” implicit in the trapezoid itself. The Black Magical applications of the CTL seem virtually boundle ss, and it is to the credit of Anton Szandor LaVey, first Grand Ma ster of the Order of the Trapezoid, and perhaps the greatest magical genius of this century, th at he was first able to extract the practical magical applications from Mortensen’s æsthetic theories.

Let established sophisms be dethroned, rooted out, burnt, and destroyed -for they are a standing menace to all true nobility of thought an d action. Whatever alleged “truth” is proven by results to be but an empty fiction, let it be unceremoniously flung into the outer darkness, among the dead gods, dead empires, dead philosophi es, and other useless lumber and wreckage. The most dangerous of all enthr oned lies is the holy, the sanctif ied, the privileged lie -the lie that everyone believes to be a m odel truth. It is the fruitful moth er of all other popular errors and delusions. It is a hydra-headed. It ha s a thousand roots. It is a social cancer. The lie that is known to be a lie is half-eradicated. But the lie that even intelligent persons re gard as a sacred fact - the lie that has been inculcated around a mother's knee -is more dangerous to contend against than a creeping pestilence. Popular lies have ever been the most potent enemies of personal liberty. There is only one way to deal with them: Cut them out, to the very core, just as cancers are. Exterminate them root and branch, or they will surely eat us all up. Annihilate them, or they will us. Half and half remedies are of no avail. However, when a lie has gone too far - when it ha s taken up its abode in the very tissues, bones, and brains of a people, then all remedies are usele ss. Even the lancet is of no avail. Repentance of past misdeeds cannot “save” decadents from extermin ation. The fatal bolt is shot, and into the fiery furnace of wholesale slavery they must go, to be there righteously consumed. From their ashes something new, something nobler, may possibly evol ve; but even that is the merest optimistic supposition. In nature the wages of sin are always death. Nature does not l ove the wrong-doer, but endeavors in every way to destroy him. Her curs e is on the brow of the “meek and lowly”. Her blessing is on the very heart's blood of the strong and the brave. Only Jews and Christs and other degenerates think that rejuvena tion can ever come through law a nd prayer. “All the tears of the martyrs” might just as well have never been shed. III. “Love one another”, you say, is the supreme law. But what pow er has made it so? Upon what rational authority does the gospel of love rest? Is it even pos sible of practice, and what would result from its universal application to active affairs? Why should I not hate mine enemies and hunt them down like the wild beasts they are? If I “love” th em, does that not place me at their mercy? Is it natural for enemies to “do good” unto each other? And what is “good”? Can the torn and bloody victim “love” the blood-splashed ja ws that rend him limb from limb? Are we not all predatory animals by instinct? If humans ceased wholly from preying upon each other, could they continue to exist? [Is not “lust and carnal desire” a more truthful term to describe “love” when applied to the continuance of the race? Is not the “love” of the fawning scriptur es simply a euphemism for sexual activity, or was the “great teach er” a glorifier of eunuchs?] “Love your enemies and do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you” is the despicable philosophy of the spanie l that rolls upon its back when kicked. Obey it, O reader, and you and your posterity to the tenth generation shall be irretrievably and literally damned. They shall be hewers of wood and carriers of water: degene rates, Gibeonites. But hate your enemies with a whole heart. If a man smite you on one cheek, smas h him down! Smite him hip and thigh, for self- preservation is the highest law. He who turns the other cheek is a cowardly dog - a Christian dog. Give him blow for blow, scorn for scorn, doom for doom -with compound interest liberally added thereunto! Eye for eye, tooth for tooth -aye, four-fold, a hundred-f old! Make yourself a"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Terror to your adversary; and when he goeth hi s way, he will possess much additional wisdom to ruminate over. Thus shall you make yourself respected in all the walks of lif e, and your spirit - your immortal spirit - shall live: not in an intangible paradise, but in the brains and thews of your aggressive and unconquerable sons. After all, the true proof of manhood is a splendid progeny; and it is a scientific axiom that the timid anim al transmits timidity to its descendants. If men lived “like brothers” a nd had no powerful enemies to cont end with and surpass, they would rapidly lose all their best qua lities - like certain oceanic birds that lose the use of their wings because they do not have to fly from pursuing beasts of prey. If all men had treated each other with brotherly love since the beginni ng, what would have been the re sult now? If there had been no wars, no rivalry, no competition, no kingship, no sl avery, no survival of the toughest, no racial extermination, truly what a festering “he ll fenced in” this old globe would be! IV. If this struggle is ordained of us, why not enter into it with kindly courage, with dauntless delight? Why not go forward daring all things, to conquer or to die? Is it not better to perish than to serve? “Liberty or death” is not a meaningless phrase. No, it is of tremendous import to those who - comprehend. What is death that it should make cowards of us all? What is life that it should be values so highly? There are worse things than death, and among them is a life of dishonor. All men lead dishonorable lives who serve a master with hand or brain. Life itself is but a spark in th e gloom that flashes out and di sappears [1]. Why therefore not make the most of it here and now - here and now! There is no “Heaven of glory bright”, and no He ll where sinners roast. There is no Right; there is no Wrong - nor God - nor Son - nor Ghost. Death endeth all for every man. For every “son of thunder”: Then be a Lion in the path, And don't be trampled under. For us there is no rest -no Kingdom of Indolence , either on this Earth or beyond the skies -no Isles of the Blest - no Elysian Fields - no garden of the Hesperides. No! No! All these magical legends are but fanciful waking dreams - fiction of mortals of yore. Here and now is our day of torment! Here and now is our day of joy! Here and now is our opportunity! Choose ye this day, this hour, for no Redeemer liveth. Every attempt made to organize the future must necessarily collapse. The present is our domain, and our chief duty is to take immediate posse ssion thereof upon strict business principles. Strive therefore against them that strive agai nst you, and war against them that war against thine. Lay hold of shield and buckler or their equi valents; stand up! Be a terrible one in thine own defense. Raise up also the clench ed hand, and stop the way of them that would persecute you. Say unto thine own heart and soul: “I, ev en I, am my own redeemer.” Let them be hurled back to confusion and infa my, who devise thine undoing. Let them be as chaff before the cyclone, and let the Angel of Deat h pursue them, nay, overtake them. In a pit they have hidden a trap for thy feet; in to that very destruction let th em fall. Then, exultant, “sound the loud timbrel”. Rejoice! Rejoice! in thine own sa lvation. Then all thy bone s shall say pridefully, “Who is like unto me? Have I not delivered myself by mine own brain? Have I not been too strong for mine adversaries? Have I not spoile d them that would have spoiled me?” V. Blessed are the strong, for they sh all possess the Earth.

Smith II° in The Scroll of Set #XIII-3, June XXII/1987 Reading through past issues of the Scroll of Set, I came across a statement by Susan Wylie (March/April XVI: “The Devil’s Game”): “One s hould remember that, prior to I ÆS, there had never been any organization or be lief structure similar to the Chur ch of Satan.” Although this was written several years ago, I must reach across the years and address th is serious error. The implications for those of us in the Temple today are no less severe. “I know that I am challenging the cultural trad ition of two and a half thousand years.” The speaker was not Anton LaVey. The speaker was a novelist, playwright, and philosopher, Ayn Rand. From the springboard of he r famous, bestselling novels ( The Fountainhead in 1943 and Atlas Shrugged in 1957) was created the philosophy of Obj ectivism, which attracted thousands of persons - myself included - who were more than “openly honest regarding what they believed” but studied, wrote, taught, and practiced what they held to be the highest expression of living. Although like others I now have some obvious points of philosophica l disagreement with Objectivism, the legacy of this enormous Satanic break with the past remains a fact of history that is of prime importance to Setians everywhere. To imply or state that the Church of Satan was the first to clearly state the Satanic ethic is to ignore the continuing impact of Ayn Rand and individualists influenced by her wo rk such as Nathaniel Branden [ The Psychology of Self-Esteem and Honoring the Self ] and Harry Browne [ How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World ]. It would instead benefit us to enrich our understanding of what the Gift of Set has meant and does mean to others who preceded I ÆS. To illustrate this historical precedent, let us ex amine the Nine Satanic Statements in view of the Rand work Atlas Shrugged . In Galt’s speech (pages #936-993) is the written source of most of the philosophical ideas expressed in the Satanic Bible . Here are the first clear, contemporary statements which led to the glorification of man’s pride and the denouncing of the life-killing concept called altruism. Here also is a vindicati on of rationality and the inevitab le cause of the failure of the Church of Satan to encompass the need s of intelligent and curious minds. Note that the sequent ial order of these Atlas Shrugged quotations parallels the order of the Nine Satanic Statements. 1. LaVey: Satan represents indul gence instead of abstinence. Rand: A doctrine that gives you, as an ideal, the role of a sacrificial animal se eking slaughter on the altars of others, is giving you death as your standa rd. By the grace of reality and the nature of life, man - every man - is an end in himself. He exists for his own sake, and the achievement of his own happiness is his highest mo ral purpose. (page 940) 2. LaVey: Satan represents vital existen ce instead of spiritual pipe dreams. Rand: My morality, the morality of reason, is contai ned in a single axiom: existence exists - and in a single choice: to live. The rest proceeds from these. (page 944) 3. LaVey: Satan represents undefiled wis dom instead of hypocritical self-deceit. Rand: Honesty is not a social duty, not a sacrific e for the sake of others, but the most profoundly selfish virtue man can practice: his refusal to s acrifice the reality of his own existence to the deluded consciousness of others. (page 945) 4. LaVey: Satan represents kindness to those who de serve it instead of love wasted on ingrates. Rand: To withhold your contempt from men’s vices is an act of moral counterfeiting, and to withhold your admiration from their virtues is an act of moral embezzlement. (page 946) 5. LaVey: Satan represents vengeance in stead of turning the other cheek. Rand: When a man attempts to deal with me by force, I answer him by force. (page 950) "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"6. LaVey: Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires. Rand: You have been using fear as your wea pon, and have been bringing death to man as his punishment for rejecting your morality. We offer him life as his reward for accepting ours. (page 950) 7. LaVey: Satan represents man as just another an imal - sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours -who, because of his “divine spiritua l and intellectual development”, has become the most vicious animal of all. Rand: Damnation is the start of your morality; destruction is its pur pose, means, and end.Your code begins by damning man as evil, then demands that he practice a good which it defines as impossible for him to practice. It demands, as his first proof of virtue, that he accept his own depravity without proof. It demands that he start not with a standard of value but with a standard of evil, which is himself, by means of which he is then to define the good; the good is that which he is not. (page 951) 8. LaVey: Satan represents all of the so-called si ns, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification. Rand: What is the nature of the guilt that your te achers call his Original Sin? What are the evils man acquired when he fell from a state they consider perfection? Their myth d eclares that he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge - he acquired a mind and became a rational being. It was the knowledge of good and evil; he became a moral be ing. He was sentenced to earn his bread by his labor; he became a productive being. He was sent enced to experience de sire; he acquired the capacity of sexual enjoyment. The evils fo r which they damn him are reason, morality, creativeness, joy - all the cardinal va lues of his existence. (page 951) 9. LaVey: Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had, as he ha s kept it in business all these years. Rand: And as he now crawls through the wreckage, groping blindly for a way to live, your teachers offer him the help of a morality that proclaims that he’ll find no solution and must seek no fulfillment on Earth. Real existence, they tell him, is that which he cannot perceive, true consciousness is the faculty of pe rceiving the non-existent - and if he is una ble to understand it, that is the proof that his existence is evil and his consciousness impotent. (page 952) I think that most careful examinations of the Satanic Bible will show how the Nine Satanic Statements acted as an outline for the “Book of Lucifer” essays. Anton LaVey is the Magus of the Age of Sata n, and did Utter a Word and cause a magical restructuring of the universe. As the instrument of the creation of that Age, he is immortalized. At the same time, credit for the source of the ph ilosophy which he espoused must be given to Ayn Rand. Please understand that I was an Ob jectivist prior to jo ining the Church of Satan. It was the intellectual rigor demanded by Objectivism which enab led me to appreciate the full meaning of the Satanic Bible . At the same time I first completed reading it, I said that here I had found Objectivism with an open mind concerning paranormal phenomena. The importance of all this to Setians is that the foundation for the philosophy of Satanism much more closely embraces the philosophy of the Temp le of Set than the r eactionary, anti-Christian Church of Satan. Further the Objectivist source for the Satanic philosophy has been carefully researched and elaborated [sometimes refuted in part] in numerous libertar ian books and articles. To my mind, what distinguished the Temple of Set from all other organizations is its non- dogmatic embracing of both the rationa l and the intuitive, while refusi ng to allow the rational to be undercut. Those who worked with the “unevolved” Church of Satan prior to X ÆS should know that battles were being waged in open forums against the anti-human fo rces of altruism in the name of reason prior to I ÆS. These heroic efforts s hould not be forgotten or ignored, but should be examined for additional aids along our path to Xeper ."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Photo Gallery "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Colophon The Satanic Bible (Underground Edition) Version 1.00, Hallowe’en 2006 e.v. / XLI A.S.
