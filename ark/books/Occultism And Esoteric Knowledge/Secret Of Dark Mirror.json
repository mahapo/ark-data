In this case the teac her c ame in the form of a book. M y first introd uctio n to Wester n Ma gick still stands as the best survey work written on the practical aspects of the subject: The Black Arts by Richard Cavendish, published in 1968. Using Ca vendish’s exce llent biblio graph y I quickly acquired W aite ’s The Book of Black Magic & Pacts alo ng with the M athers-Crowley Goetia , Mat her’s The Key of Solomon the King , and Francis Barrett ’s The Magus . The m edieval Key of Solomon pro vided a n authentic handbook for m aking magical regalia, implements and talis mans but it w as the more n otorio us Goetia of the Lemegeton , the so-called Lesser Key of Solomon , that was the rea l wizard’s Liber Spirituum . The Goetia (pro nounced Go-EY-sha) catalog ed and described 72 rebellio us spirits th at, acc ording to a Talm udic legend, old Ki ng Solomon has imprisoned in an enchanted Bras s vessel submerged in a la ke in Bab ylon. Thi s read li ke a fabulous tale from The A rabian Nights but in my irratio nal state I was convinced that there w as a hidde n truth behind the fantastic s tory. Like Aladd in’s wonderful lam p or Ali Baba’s “Open Sesame” there w as a Secret K ey to calling up those m ighty pri nces of the Jinn that Solomon had impriso ned so long ago – and I was determined to find it. Years later, when I w as doing graduate studies in cultural an thropolo gy I realized that back in 1969 I had crossed over into a realm of divine madness that few Anglo-American s had ever experie nce d. I had gone through a true shamanic initiation, that mortal illness and vision quest that bri ngs the shaman in touch with his gods and gives him the power to practice h is cra ft . . . It w as during that se ason of my ma dness, when agony alternated w ith ecstasy, that I had discovered, or more prop erly re-discovered, t he lost se cret o f the ma gical Art and I w rote The Book of Astarte from which the key pas sage that heads this chapter is dra wn. (see Note 1.) I had studied th e w ritings of the ancient and modern magicians. The y had filled their boo ks with the mo st detailed i nstructions on how to bu ild, inscribe and decorate all the necessary equipm ent, all t he signatures of the sp irits and even the hours in which to summon them – but the most importa nt element, that method by which one could make the spirit p hysically app ear, was always missing from the old grimoires and not explained in the recent texts, I knew that over a doze n ancient and modern writers on magick could no t be involved in one big, long-standing conspiracy to s uppress this final secret, s o it s eemed ob vious that at so me time after the 17 th cen tury and before th e middle o f the 19 th century the practical ke ys to th e m agical e voc ation and in vocation proc esses had been lost."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Thi s turned out to be true. The a ncien t writers had hidde n the secret s in plain sight – as you will see w hen we examine the old te xts – b ut the Victor ian age m agicians of the Go lden Dawn school, with their phobia a gainst hypnosis and their co mm endable d istrust of passive sp iritualist m ediumship, had de- emphasized the actual me thods of renaissance e vocatio n and invocation in favor of a W estern Tantra in which images are caref ully built up in the imagination an d then allo wed to pro vide p sychic feedbac k. Instead o f the traditio nal cr ystals and dark mirrors for visionary work, they pre ferred to u se abstract colored symbols to stimulate the imagination. These me thods are di fferent in conceptio n and technique from the shamanic calli ng down or summoning up of spontaneou s visions from that gr eat storehouse of images renaissance ma gicians knew as “T he W orld So ul” and we now refer to a s “The Collecti ve Unconscious”. If I hadn’t bee n touched with divine ma dness aty the time I p robabl y would have accepted t he Victor ian reco nstructi on of magick and put asi de my yearning to a ctually conj ure spirits to visible appeara nce in Solomon’s Triangle o f Art. I would have agreed w ith critic s like Professor Eli za Butler that those w ho practiced out of the old gr imoires were credulous and self-deluded. However Arthur Edward Wait e, who was also a ruthless critic of the Art Ma gical, had conceded t hat they had achieved res ults. In the introd uction to his 189 8 Book of Black magic & Pacts he wrote: -- “ It w ould, however, be unsafe to affirm that all per sons making use of the ceremonies in the rituals w ould fail to obtai n results. Perhaps in the ma jority of case s most of such expe riments m ade i n the past were atte nded with results of a kind. To enter the pat h of hallucination is likely to ensure hallucination, and in the pre sence of hypnotic and clair voyant facts it w ould be absurd to assume that the seeeri ng proc ess of ancient magic – which were ma ny – did not produce se ership, or th at the auto-hypnotic state which much magical rit ual would obviously tend to occa sion in predi spo sed per son s did not frequently induce, and not always in the predispo sed. To this extent some of the proc esses are practical, an d to this extent they are da ngerous.” Thi s paragraph was one of the clues that s et me on the trail to disc overi ng the secret o f Solomon’s Triangle. It should be note that I had fi rst rea d all the available 16 th and 17 th cen tury material bef ore I got into Regardie a nd the Golden Dawn. Therefore m y original perspecti ve w as, and still re mains, that of a renaissance ma gician rather than a Victoria n occ ultist (even though I will be the first to con cede ou r tremendous debt to t he Golden Dawn). I th ink it is importan t to me ntion this becau se there is a natural tende ncy for people to be h eavily influenced by their first impressions in any field of endea vor. Thi s was especiall y true in my cas e gi ven my near-terminal illness and altered st ate of con sciousness. I literally devoured the book s list ed abo ve with the obsession of a reli gious fanatic. But e ven in the grip of a toxic psychosis, I hadn’t lost m y intellect. Mad ness is known to st imulate genius. I w as on the verge of discoveri ng, or re- discoverin g, an extraordi nary secret hidden in these quaint, and appare ntly whimsical, books of forgotten lore. I knew there had to be a way to m ake Solomon’s traditio nal o perati ons actually work without resorting to drugs, fasting or endless conjuration s to p roduce hallucinations through hysteria an d exhaustion. A century ago Aleister Crowley had tried to c onjure one of the Lemegeton’s Goetia de mons out of incense smoke. He had very little success after a great deal of effort. A s a se lf-taught hypnotist this did not surprise me. Trying to fo rm an image, or commanding a spir it to produ ce an image out of curling, twisting smoke was more of an experim ent in telek inesis than a scrying proces s. Crowley obviously did no t know the tech nique but he certainly understood the philosoph y. He stateed i t clearl y in his 1904 editi on of The Goetia : “ But c an any of the effects de scribed in this our boo k Goetia be obtain ed, a nd if so, can you give a ratio nal explanation of the circ umstances? Say you so? I can, and w ill. The s pirits of the Goetia are porti ons of the human brai n. Their seals therefore repres ent (Mr. S pence r’s projected cube) methods of stimulating and regulating those particular spots (through the eye). The n ames of God a re vibrations calc ulated t o est ablish: (a) General co ntrol o f the brai n. (E stabli shment of functions relati ve to the subtle world.) (b) Control o ver the brai n in detai n. (Rank or ty pe of spirit.)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"(c) Control o f one special po rtion. (N ame of the spirit.) The per fumes aid this through smell. Usually the perfume will only tend to con trol a large area; but there is an attribution of perfumes to letter s of the alp hab et enabling one, b y Qabalistic formula, to s pell out the spirit’s name. I need no t enter into a more particular discussion of these poi nts; the intelligent read er can easily fill in what is lacking. If then I say, with Solomon: “The spi rit Cimieres teach es logic,” what I mean is:” those portions of my brai n which subserve the logical faculty my be stimulated and developed by following out the proces s called “ The Evocatio n of Cimieres.” I have quoted the abo ve pa ssage at s ome length beca use it made such a strong impression on me when I fi rst rea d it. It is certai nly not romantic or artistic; in fact it is downright analytical – lik e wiring a ballet dance r with electro nic sensors so we can get a scientific read- out on Swan Lake – but it serves an absolutely necessary purpose. Crowley’s statem ent place s Solomon’s Magick squarely within the para meter s of a psychological s ystem. “ Solomon’s spirits are portio ns of the human brai n.” But the human brai n is only the ha rdware for the greatest co mputer s ystem ever de signed: The H uman Mind. A modern hacker-magus would say we run our Solomonic Magick program on an operat ing system desi gned by Carl Jung using a lan guage called “ Agrippa 777.” For those w ho are n ot yet magical cybernauts that ne eds some explaining: Crowley’s con ceptions of Magick pre-dated Carl Jung’s Archetypes in the Collecti ve U nconscious theory. Crowley knew that magical m anifestatio ns involved altered s tate s of con sciou sness and could prod uce psychosomatic effects but he may not have been aware that entire pa ntheons of ancient Gods and Go dde sses, choirs of Angels, and hordes of dem ons might exists in the deepe st reach es of everyone’s mind. Actually the theory was not very moder n. Around 200 A.D. Hermes Trism egistus, the mysterious founder of Hermetic Phil osophy, had written in his Asclepius that: “The Gods of the Zodiac are eter nal but man create s his own lesser gods.” The implicatio ns of this statem ent are awesome. If we crea te gods, then we control them! And if we can control t hem, are w e not Gods ourselves? (En Tuo Tem plo, Tu Es Deus!) Thi s is why the late W arburg Institute sc holar Francis Ya tes called The Asclepius “T he charge of dynamite beh ind Renaissance N eoplato nism.” Echoes of that e xplosion reverberate i n the words of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa w ritten in 152 7: “ ... Such things are de livered a nd w rit by great a nd gr ave philosoph ers, whose tradition who dare say are false? Nay, it were impious to think them lies: only there is another meaning than what is writ with the bare letter s. We must look for the pri nciple o f these grand operatio ns without ourselves; it i s that internal spirit within us which can very well perform whatsoever the monstrous ma thematicians, the prodi gious magicians, the wonderful alchymists and the bewitching necromancers can effect.” In the 1920 ’s Jung declared t hat be neath and be yond the person al subconscious mind there fl owed a vast, deep se a of dream im ages and forgotten lore h e referred to a s “The Collecti ve Unconscious”. This mysterious psychic ocean was not the exclusive property of any individual human bei ng. It was a dimension shared b y us all! Here one might discover the great Archetypes of m ythology: the heroes, the beautiful cou rtesans, the martyred saints and mo nstrous villains of our past. Here w ere the mysterious ma n-created gods w hich Hermes Trismegistus had w ritten abo ut so long ago. Here was the World Soul of the Renaissance magicians. Here were the demons of Solomon’s Brass Vessel. Wh en Jung discussed his theory with his famous colleag ue, Sigmund Freud, Freud was horrified. “Carl!” he whispered. “If you reveal this to the public yo u will release a black flood of occultism!” However it would take mo re than just a theory to relea se the flood of occultism Freud fe ared . Theorie s by themselves do not prod uce results. For results the magician still depe nds toda y, as he did thousands of years ago, on methods and tech niques. Since time imm emorial magicians have placed t hemselves and others into s tate s of trance du ring which visions and oracle s were recei ved. We now know that this proc ess was hypnotic and that a ll the phenomena we have com e to a ssociate w ith modern hypnosis were in fact kn own and p racticed by ancient sorcerer s under the guise of ‘fascination’, ‘spell-casting’ and ‘enchantment’. The po werful hypnotic effect achieved through a fixed gaze at a reflectiv e surface is the reason why the crystal ball, or s hewstone, and the dark mirror ( the spec ulum), were used by wizards of olden tim es as their spirit us loc ii, the actu al place where the angels and sp irits co uld be conj ured to v isible appearance. Thi s was and still is a hypnotic proce ss. . . H owever the final secret o f how to use these m agical aides was always missing. With all the philosop hy, the atmosphere, the paraph ernali a, the po werful conjurations and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the hypnotic tec hniques, such spontaneou s visions in a crystal or i n a dark mirror, still depe nded u pon some spec ial psychic talent. To make it rea lly work one ha d to be a natural me dium – No w, with all my hypnotic experiments and my toxic fever dream s, I had certainly becom e a m ystic . . . but not a clairvoyant. Thi s is a very importa nt poi nt. Medi ums, psychics and clair voyants have dom inated the mystic arts for centuries because most of us have assumed that they are the only ones gifted with the abilitie s to s ee and hear the spiri ts. This situation was so pervasive that even great ma gicians like Abramelin the Mag e, Dr. Joh n Dee, Count Cagliostro and the later F rederic k Ho ckley thought they had to employ specially talen ted scryers or g ifted children to do the act ual receiving for them. If I had been in a fully ratio nal state o f mind at the time I probabl y would have accepted th is historicall y establis hed handicap – but ob sessed g enius knows no bounds. I was convinced there h ad to be a w ay, a m ethod by which anyone with the desire and the determination could su mmon spirits to visible appe arance a nd converse with them. This w as what Solom on had pro mised a nd – like the indefatiguable a mateur archaeo logist Henrich Schlieman, who had actu ally discovered T roy right where Homer said it w as – I w as sure that the medieval ‘Solomon’ was telling the truth. I could place a crystal ball into th e triangle, but then if I stood bac k inside t he magick circle, as the operator was suppose d to do accordi ng to the ancient tex ts, even a 60m m ball would appear t he size of a door knob – but I k new something had to b e placed in that triangle: so met hing fascinating, something hypnotic, and so met hing large enough to pro vide a viewing surface....Obviously the speculum, the dar k mirror....And what better entrance into that realm the m ystic poet Co leridg e had called: “Caverns measureless to man.” It ha d to be the dar k mirror! But h ow to use it? How to ma ke it a ctually work, I asked myself – then something I h ad rea d the year before jo gged my me mory – something I had read somewhere abo ut the use of dar k mirrors in the Far East....? That all-importan t clue had been sitting right there o n my book shelf! The s ecret w as in a work called Tantra, The Yoga of Sex by Omar Garrison publi shed in 1964. In this boo k the author explained an ancient Oriental method of conjuring up images of previous incarnations from the reflection of one’s own face.....i n a dar k mirror... .flanked by can dles! As I re -read th is pas sage in Garrison ’s book I felt a shiver of excitement. I was expe riencing the same tingling exhilaration that an arc haeolo gist must feel when he brushes away the sand and look s down at the unbroken seal o f an ancient royal tomb! I tried Ga rrisons’s expe riment and found that it worked with remarkable effectiveness. If a p erson in a dar kened roo m stares for several mi nutes into a mirror flanked by can dles , a strange phenomenon will almost a lways happe n: the familiar ref lectio n will fade out and disapp ear. The mi rror w ill go black and, when the image returns, it w ill be the face of someo ne or something else! Thi s experie nce is usually accom pan ied b y a profound sense of other-worldly pres ence... It w as obv ious that this phenomenon must have been discovered long before a ny con cept of reinca rnation. It prob ably went back as far as th e paleolit hic when stone-age people st ared f ascinated at their re flectio ns in dark, still pool s of water, se eing the strange transformation occur – and being convinced they were in the pres ence of their Gods! I suspected t hat in a rit ual sett ing, using traditio nal co njuratio ns and symbols, specific spirits and even ancien t Go ds and Godde sses might be summoned from the ‘Other Side’....This might well be t he ancient secret beh ind that strange passage in the Bible that reads: “God fashioned Man in His own image.” It w as certainly the reason why Solomon has us com mand the spirit, often described as a monstrous hybrid, to “Appear in fair an d human form and speak unto us in a clear, i ntelligible v oice in our mother tongue.” After this discovery the use of the magick mirror in an ele vated tri angle seemed obvious. Our late 17 th cen tury Lemegeton manuscript, Sloane 2731 , clearl y shows a large blac k-filled cir cle in the center of Solomon’s Tria ngle."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Note th at the instructions written aro und the Triangle s ay: “Two foot off from the Circle and three foot over.) – N ot “ Three foot across,” a s the published version has it. The T riangle was intended to be raised up to eye level. . . . Thi s is clea rly shown in a drawing from a 17 th century ma nuscript by the mysterious D. Thomas Rudd, which depticts a m irror on a stand with Solomon’s Sec ret Seal from the Goetia of the Lemegeto n clea rly rendered on the reverse s ide. . . (See figure 2.) We know that polished obsi dian mirror s w ere used in the neolithic Mi ddle Easter n city of Katal Hyuck as far back as nine thousand years ago – b efore t he Great Fl ood.

Now I am certai n that some of my ma gical colleagues will cluck in their beards and say: “Well Runyon developed an effective system – but it’s modern.” They will cite the fact, alread y me ntioned, that Cagliostro, D ee, Hockley and others had to em ploy scryers to do t heir visioning. If these worthies hadn’t know the reflection secret, then who had known? My answer is that the me dieval Ar abian magicians proba bly knew it as th ese qu otes from C. J. S. Tho mpson indica te: “According to Arab tradition, m agic or ‘sihr’ , which means ‘to produce an il lusion before the eyes’ was revealed by two angel s in Babe l, named Harut and Maru t , who instructed mankind in this art . . . When a miracle was deemed a ‘sihr’ it was regarded as an optical illusion or due to a n illicit dealing with demons . . . The use of the magic mirror – which was made of m etal or glass with a polished surface – for seeing spirits, was known to the Ara bs at an early period. The image was said to Appear in a cloud or vapor floating between the m edium used and the gazer’s eye. . .” Ceco d’ Ascoli, Dr. Tho mas Ru dd and others may very well have known but ke pt it s ecret. The method was so simple that there was no need to w rite it do wn. It cou ld have been passed from mouth-to-ear (and yet the hints in the Sloane 2731 Goetia are al most too ob vious). We should recall t hat the Goetia was not a system ma gicians felt comfortab le w riting about bac k in the days of the Inquisition. And they did n ot need C arl Ju ng’s subjective psychological theo ries to ju stify using their own reflection as a foca l point. There w as a haunting Orphic myth abou t Dyonisus being entranced by his own reflection in a mirror , cau ght by the Titans and torn to piece s, his parts rescued by Zeus and given to Apollo to pla nt in the earth – from which he rose rec onstituted and revived. Here w e have the m odern psychological con cep ts of fragmentation, reintegratio n and individuation of the per sonali ty; we also have our seventy-two all-enco mpassing spirits let out and put back into The Bras s V essel. The ancients did not create su ch fables for idle am usement. But m y most telli ng argument sits in every grammar school cla ss in the cou ntry. Along with play ing hopsco tch on The Tree of Life, children have a game called “Bl ood y Mary” (Cl ive Barker’s Candyman ) which they have been scaring each other with as long as there have been mirror s to look into. Any modern magician who thinks his predeces sors did n’t discover this same phenomenon ages ago and made use of it d oesn’t hold them in very high regard – but to th ose w ho still insist that this method of magical e vocatio n is m odern, I w ill be most happy to accep t credit for it. (See Note 2.) In the week following my remarkable discovery (or re- discovery) my illness overcame me to s uch a deg ree t hat m y doctor was com pelled to conduct a mo re through examination. At that he discovered t he truth and adv ised me that only an operation could sa ve my life – but that I was too debilitated a nd inflamed to u ndergo the surgery. I asked the Archangel Ra phael to heal me and Pri nce Ba’al to gi ve me strength – then (beca use the Gods help those who help themselves) I went out and found an other doctor. W hen I recov ered from my surgical ope ration, health and sanity quickly returned – b ut I remember what I h ad lear ned during my sabbatical i n Tart arus and, to m y surprise, I di scov ered th at Solomon’s Magick was still as effective – and even more so when con trasted w ith my otherwise ratio nal state o f mind. To my even greater s urprise, I fo und that this ancient system would work for any sincere person who could con cen trate on a fixed poin t lon g enough to achieve a light hypnotic trance. I extended my experi ments to include others and I soon discovered that the proces s was just a s effective if I – as the magician – s tood be hind a passive ‘receiver’ who would only need to h old the candle sticks and con centrate on the mirror."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"At that tim e I was a bac helor in my thirties, living in a beac h-side So uthern California apart ment and ridi ng a mo torcycle.
