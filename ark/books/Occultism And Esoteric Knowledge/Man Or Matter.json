The beginnings of this method were worked out by Goethe more than 150 years ago. The nineteenth century, however, failed to provide any fertile ground for the development of the seeds thus sown. It was left to Rudolf Steiner, shortly before the end of the century, to recognize the signi ficance of 'Goetheanism' for the future development not only of science but of human culture in general. It is to him, also, that we owe the possibility of carrying on Go ethe's efforts in the way required by the needs of our own time. The following pages contain results of the author's work along the path thus opened up by Goethe and Rudolf Steiner - a work begun twenty-seven years ago, soon after he had made the acquaintance of Rudolf Stei ner. With the publication of these results he addresses himself to everyone - with or without a specialized scientific training - who is concerned with the fate of man' s powers of cognition in the present age. * The reader may welcome a remark as to th e way in which this book needs to be read. It has not been the author's intention to provide an en cyclopaedic collection of new conceptions in various fields of natural observation. Rather did he wish, as the sub- title of the book indicates, to offer a new method of training both mind and eye (and other senses as well), by means of whic h our modern 'onlooking' consciousness can be transformed into a new kind of 'partici pating' consciousness. Hence it would be of no avail to pick out one chapter or another for first reading, perhaps because of some special interest in its subject-matter. The ch apters are stages on a road which has to be travelled, and each stage is necessary for reaching the next. It is only through thus accepting the method with which the book has been written that the reader will be able to form a competent judgment of its essential elements. E. L.

I am sure, too, that although what I have to say in th is chapter is personal in cont ent, it is characteristic of many in our time. When I first made acquaintance with Rudolf Steiner and his work, I was finishing my academic training as an electrical engineer . At the end of the 1914-18 war my first thought had been to take up my studies fr om where I had let them drop, four years earlier. The war seemed to imply nothing mo re than a passing interruption of them. This, at any rate, was the opinion of my former teachers; the war had made no difference whatever to their ideas, whether on the subject-matter of their teaching or on its educational purpose. I myself, however, soon began to feel differently. It became obvious to me that my relationship to my subject, and therefore to those teaching it, had completely changed. Wh at I had experienced through the war had awakened in me a question of which I ha d previously been unaware; now I felt obliged to put it to everything I came across. As a child of my age I had grown up in the conviction that it was within the scope of man to shape his life according to the laws of reason within him; his progress, in the sense in which I then understood it, seem ed assured by his increasing ability to determine his own outer conditions with the he lp of science. Indeed, it was the wish to take an active part in th is progress that had led me to choose my profession. Now, however, the war stood there as a gigantic social deed whic h I could in no way regard as reasonably justified. How, in an age wh en the logic of science was supreme, was it possible that a great part of mankind, including just those peoples to whom science had owed its origin and never-ceasing expansion, coul d act in so completely unscientific a way? Where lay the causes of the contradiction thus revealed between human thinking and human doing? Pursued by these questions, I decided after a while to give my studies a new turn. The kind of training then provided in Germany at the so-called Technische Hochschulen was designed essentially to give students a close practical acquaintance with all sorts of technical appliances; it included only as much theory as was wanted for understanding the mathematical calculations arising in technical practice. It now seemed to me necessary to pay more attenti on to theoretical considerations, so as to"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 gain a more exact knowledge of the sources from which science drew its conception of nature. Accordingly I left the Hochschul e for a course in mathematics and physics at a university, though without abandoning my or iginal idea of preparing for a career in the field of electrical engineering. It was with this in mind that I later chose for my Ph.D. thesis a piece of experimental resear ch on the uses of high-frequency electric currents. During my subsequent years of stuffy, how ever, I found myself no nearer an answer to the problem that haunted me. All that I experienced, in scientific work as in life generally, merely gave it an even sharper edge. Everywhere I saw an abyss widening between human knowing and human ac tion. How often was I not bitterly disillusioned by the behaviour of men for whose ability to think through the most complicated scientific questions I had the utmost admiration! On all sides I found this same bewildering gulf between scientific achievement and the way men conducted their own lives and influenced the lives of others. I was forced to the conclusion that human thinki ng, at any rate in its modern form, was either powerless to govern human actions, or at least unable to direct them towards right ends. In fact, where sc ientific thinking had done most to change the practical relations of human life, as in the mechanization of economic production, conditions had arisen which made it more difficult, not less, for men to live in a way worthy of man. At a time when humanity was equipped as never before to investigate the order of the universe, and had achieved triumphs of design in mechanical constructions, human life was falling into ever wilder chaos. Why was this? The fact that most of my contemporaries were appare ntly quite unaware of the problem that stirred me so deeply could not weaken my sense of its reality. This slumber of so many souls in face of the vita l questions of modern life seemed to me merely a further symptom of the sickness of our age. Nor could I think much better of those who, more sensitive to the contradicti ons in and around them, sought refuge in art or religion. The catastrophe of the war had shown me that this departmentalizing of life, which at one time I had myself considered a sort of ideal, was quite inconsistent with the needs of to-day. To ma ke use of art or religion as a refuge was a sign of their increasing separation from th e rest of human cu lture. It implied a cleavage between the different spheres of society which ruled out any genuine solution of social problems. I knew from history that reli gion and art had once exerci sed a function which is to- day reserved for science, for they had gi ven guidance in even the most practical activities of human society. And in so doi ng they had enhanced the quality of human living, whereas the influence of science has had just the opposite effect. This power of guidance, however, they had long since lost, and in view of this fact I came to the conclusion that salvation must be looked fo r in the first place from science. Here, in the thinking and knowing of man, was the root of modern troubles; here must come a drastic revision, and here, if possible, a completely new direction must be found."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 Such views certainly flew in the face of the universal modern conviction that the present mode of knowledge, with whose help so much insight into the natural world has been won, is the only one possible, given once for all to man in a form never to be changed. But is there any need, I asked myself , to cling to this purely static notion of man's capacity for gaining knowledge? Among th e greatest achievements of modern science, does not the concep tion of evolution take a fo remost place? And does not this teach us that the condition of a living organism at any time is the result of the one preceding it, and that the transition implie s a corresponding functional enhancement? But if we have once recognized this as an established truth, why should we apply it to organisms at every stage of developmen t except the .highest, namely the human, where the organic form reveals and serves the self-conscious spirit? Putting the question thus, I was led inevitably to a conclusion which science itself had failed to draw from its idea of evolution. Whatever the driving factor in evolution may be, it is clear that in the kingdoms of nature leading up to man this factor has always worked on the evolving organisms fr om outside. The moment we come to man himself, however, and see how evolution has flowered in his power of conscious thought, we have to reckon with a fundamental change. Once a being has recognized itself as a pr oduct of evolution, it immediately ceases to be that and nothing more. With its very firs t act of self-knowledge it transcends its previous limits, and must in future rely on its own conscious actions for the carrying on of its development. For me, accordingly, the concept of evol ution, when thought through to the end, began to suggest the possibility of further growth in man's spiritual capacities. But I saw also that this growth could no longer be merely passive, and the question which now beset me was: by what action of his own can man break his way into this new phase of evolution? I saw that this acti on must not consist merely in giving outer effect to the natural powers of human thinki ng; that was happening everywhere in the disordered world around me. The necessary ac tion must have inner effects; indeed, it had to be one whereby the will was turned upon the thinking-powers themselves, entirely transforming them, and so removi ng the discrepancy between the thinker and the doer in modern man. Thus far I could go through my own observa tion and reflexion, but no further. To form a general idea of the deed on which everything else depended was one thing; it was quite another to know how to perform the deed, and above all where to make a start with it. Anyone intending to make a machine must first learn something of mechanics; in the same way, anyone setti ng out to do something constructive in the sphere of human consciousness - and this, fo r me, was the essential point - must begin by learning something of the laws holding sw ay in that sphere. But who could give me this knowledge? Physiology, psychology and philosophy in their ordinary forms were of no use to me, for they were themselves part and parcel of just that kind of knowing which had to be"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 overcome. In their various accounts of ma n there was no vantage point from which the deed I had in mind could be accomplished, for none of them looked beyond the ordinary powers of knowledge. It was the same with the accepted theory of evolution; as a product of the current mode of thinki ng it could be applied to everything except the one essential - this very mode of thinking. Obviously, the laws of the development of human consciousness cannot be discovered from a standpoint within the modern form of that consciousness. But how coul d one find a viewpoint outside, as it were, this consciousness, from which to disc over its laws with the same scientific objectivity which it had itself applied to di scovering the laws of physical nature? It was when this question stood before me in all clarity that destiny led me to Rudolf Steiner and his work. The occasion was a c onference held in 1921 in Stuttgart by the Anthroposophical Movement; it was one of several arranged during the years 1920-2 especially for teachers an d students at the Hochschulen and Universities. What chiefly moved me to attend this particular conference was the title of a lecture to be given by one of the pupils and co-workers of Rudolf Steiner - 'The Overcoming of Einstein's Theory of Relativity'. 1 The reader will readily appreciate what this title meant for me. In the circles where my work lay, an intense controversy was ju st then raging round Einstein's ideas. I usually took sides with the s upporters of Einstein, for it seemed to me that Einstein had carried the existing mode of scientific thinking to its logical conclusions, whereas I missed this consistency among his opponents. At the same time I found that the effect of this theory, when its implications were fully developed, was to make everything seem so 'relative' that no relia ble world-outlook was left. This was proof for me that our age was in need of an alt ogether different form of scientific thinking, equally consistent in itself, but mo re in tune with man's own being. What appealed to me in the lecture-title was simply this, that whereas everyone else sought to prove Einstein right or wrong, here was someone who apparently intended, not merely to add another proof for or agai nst his theory-there we re plenty of those already - but to take some steps to overcome it. From the point of view of orthodox science, of course, it was absurd to speak of 'overcoming' a theory, as though it were an accomplished fact, but to me this title suggested exactly what I was looking for. Although it was the title of this lecture that drew me to the Stuttgart Conference (circumstances prevented me from hearing ju st this lecture), it was the course given there by Rudolf Steiner himself which was to prove the decisive experience of my life. It comprised eight lect ures, under the title : 'Mathematics, Scientific Experiment and Observation, and Epistemological Results from the Standpoint of Anthroposophy'; what they gave me answ ered my question beyond all expectation. In the course of a comprehensive historical survey the lecturer characterized, in a way I found utterly convincing, the present mathematical interp retation of nature as a transitional stage of human consciousness - a kind of knowing which is on the way from a past pre-mathematical to a future post-mathematical form of cognition. The"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 importance of mathematics, whether as a discipline of the human spirit or as an instrument of natural science, was not for a moment undervalued. On the contrary, what Rudolf Steiner said about Projectiv e (Synthetic) Geometry, for instance, its future possibilities and its role as a means of understanding higher processes of nature than had hitherto been accessible to scienc e, clearly explained the positive feelings I myself had experienced - without knowing why - when I had studied the subject. Through his lectures and his pa rt in the discussions - th ey were held daily by the various speakers and ranged over almost every field of modern knowledge - I gradually realized that Rudolf Steiner wa s in possession of unique powers. Not only did he show himself fully at home in all th ese fields; he was able to connect them with each other, and with the nature and bei ng of man, in such a way that an apparent chaos of unrelated details was wrought into a higher synthesis. Moreover, it became clear to me that one who could speak as he did about the stages of human consciousness past, present and future, must have full access to all of them at will, and be able to make each of them an obj ect of exact observation. I saw a thinker who was himself sufficient proof that man can fi nd within the resources of his own spirit the vantage-ground for the deed which I had dimly surmised, and by which alone true civilization could be saved. Through all th ese things I knew that I had found the teacher I had been seeking. Thus I was fully confirmed in my hopes of the Conference; but I was also often astonished at what I heard. Not least among my surprises was Rudolf Steiner's presentation of Goethe as the herald of the new form of scientific knowledge which he himself was expounding. I was here introduced to a side of Goethe which was as completely unknown to me as to so many others among my contemporaries, who had not yet come into touch with Anthroposophy. For me, as for them, Goethe had always been the great thinker revealing his thoughts through poetry. Indeed, only shortly before my meeting with Rudolf Steiner it was in his poetry that Goethe had become newly alive to me as a helper in my sear ch for a fuller human experience of nature and my fellow-men. But despite all my Goethe studies I had been quite unaware that more than a century earlier he had achieved something in the field of science, organic and inorganic alike, which could help modern man towards the new kind of knowledge so badly needed to-day. This wa s inevitable for me, since I shared the modern conviction that art and science were fields of activity essentially strange to one another. And so it was again Rudolf Steiner who opened the way for me to Goethe as botanist, physicist and the like. I must mention another aspect of the St uttgart Conference which Belongs to this picture of my first encounter with Anth roposophy, and gave it special weight for anyone in my situation at that period. In Stuttgart there were ma ny different activities concerned with the practical application of Rudolf Stei ner's teachings, and so one could become acquainted with teachings and applications at the same time. There was the Waldorf School, founded little more than a year before, with several hundred pupils already. It was the first schoo l to undertake the transformation of anthroposophical knowledge of man into e ducational practice; later it was followed"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 by others, in Germany and elsewhere. Ther e was one of the clinics, where qualified doctors were applying the same knowledge to the study of illness and the action of medicaments. In various laboratories effort s were made to develop new methods of experimental research in physics, chemistr y, biology and other branches of science. Further, a large business concern had been founded in Stuttgart in an attempt to embody some of Rudolf Steiner's ideas for the re form of social life. Besides all this I could attend performances of the new art of movement, again th e creation of Rudolf Steiner and called by him 'Eurhythmy', in which the astounded eye could see how noble a speech can be uttered by the human body when its limbs are moved in accordance with its inherent sp iritual laws. Thus, in all the many things that were going on besides the lectures, one could find di rect proof of the fruitfulness of what one heard in them. 2 Under the impression of this Conference I s oon began to study the writings of Rudolf Steiner. Not quite two years later, I decide d to join professionally with those who were putting Anthroposophy into outer practi ce. Because it appeared to me as the most urgent need of the time to prepar e the new generation for the tasks awaiting it through an education shaped on the entire human being, I turned to Rudolf Steiner with the request to be taken into the Stuttgart School as t eacher of natural science. On this occasion I told him of my general scientific intere sts, and how I hoped to follow them up later on. I spoke of my intended educational activity as something which might help me at the same time to prep are myself for this other task. Anyone who learns so to see nature that his ideas can be take n up and understood by the living, lively soul of the growing child will thereby be training himself, I t hought, in just that kind of observation and thinking which the new science of nature demands. Rudolf Steiner agreed with this, and it was not long afterwards that I jo ined the school where I was to work for eleven years as a science master in the senior classes, which activity I have since continued outside Germany in a more or less similar form. This conversation with Rudolf Steiner took place in a large hall where, while we were talking, over a thousand people were assembli ng to discuss matters of concern to the Anthroposophical Movement. This did not prevent him from asking me about the details of my examination work, in which I was still engaged at that time; he always gave himself fully to whatever claimed his attention at the moment. I told him of my experimental researches in electrical high-frequency phenomena, briefly introducing the particular problem with which I was occ upied. I took it for granted that a question from such a specialized branch of physics would not be of much interest to him. Judge of my astonishment when he at once took out of his pocket a note-book and a huge carpenter's pencil, made a sketch and proceeded to speak of the problem as one fully conversant with it, and in such a way that he gave me the starting point for an entirely new conception of electricity. It was instantly borne in on me that if electricity came to be understood in this se nse, results would follow which in the end would lead to a quite new technique in the use of it. From that moment it became one of my life's aims to contribute whatever my circumstances and powers would allow to the development of an understa nding of nature of this kind."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 1 The speaker was the late Dr. Elizabeth Vreede , for some years leader of the Mathematical- Astronomical Section at the Go etheanum, Dornach, Switzerland. 2 The activities mentioned above do not exhaust the practical possibilities of Spiritual Science. At that time (1921) Rudolf Steiner had not yet given his indications for the treatment of children needing special care of soul and body, or for the renewal of th e art of acting, or for the conquest of materialistic methods in agricultural practice. Nor did there yet exist the movement for religious renewal Which Dr. Fr. Rittelmeyer later founded, with the help and advice of Rudolf Steiner. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 CHAPTER II Where Do We Stand To-day? In the year 1932, when the world celebrat ed the hundredth anniversary of Goethe's death, Professor W. Heisenberg, one of the fo remost thinkers in the field of modern physics, delivered a speech before the Saxon Academy of Science which may be regarded as symptomatic of the need in re cent science to investigate critically the foundations of its own efforts to know nature. 1 In this speech Heisenberg draws a picture of the progress of sc ience which differs significantly from the one generally known. Instead of giving the usual description of this progress as 'a chain of brilliant and surprising discoveries', he shows it as resting on the fact th at, with the aim of continually simplifying and unifying the scie ntific conception of the world, human thinking, in course of time, has narrowed mo re and more the scope of its inquiries into outer nature. 'Almost every scientific adva nce is bought at the cost of renunciation, almost every gain in knowledge sacrifices important standpoints and established modes of thought. As facts and knowledge accumulate, th e claim of the sc ientist to an understanding of the world in a certain sense diminishes.' Our justifiable admiration for the success with which the unending multiplicity of natu ral occurrences on earth and in the stars has been reduced to so simple a scheme of laws - Heisenberg implies - must therefore not make us forget that these attainment s are bought at the price 'of renouncing the aim of bringing the phenomena of nature to our thinking in an immediate and living way'. In the course of his exposition, Heisenberg al so speaks of Goethe, in whose scientific endeavours he perceives a noteworthy atte mpt to set scientif ic understanding upon a path other than that of pr ogressive self-restriction. 'The renouncing of life and immediacy, whic h was the premise for the progress of natural science since Newton, formed the real basis for the bitter struggle which Goethe waged against the physical optics of Newton. It would be superficial to dismiss this struggle as unimportant: there is much significance in one of the most outstanding men directing all his efforts to fighting against the development of Newtonian optics.' There is only one thing fo r which Heisenberg criticizes Goethe: 'If one should wish to reproach Goethe, it co uld only be for not going far enough - that is, for having attacked the views of Newton instead of decl aring that the whole of Newtonian Physics-Optics, Mechanics and the Law of Gravitation - were from the devil.'"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 Although the full significance of Heisenbe rg's remarks on Goethe will become apparent only at a later stage of our disc ussion, they have been quoted here because they form part of the symptom we wish to characterize. Only this much may be pointed out immediately, that Goethe - if not in the scientific then indeed in the poetical part of his writings - did fulfil what Heisenberg righ tly feels to have been his true task. 2 We mentioned Heisenberg's speech as a symp tom of a certain tendency, characteristic of the latest phase in scien ce, to survey critically its own epistemological foundations. A few years previous to Heisenberg's sp eech, the need of such a survey found an eloquent advocate in the late Prof essor A. N. Whitehead, in his book Science and the Modern World, where, in view of the contradi ctory nature of modern physical theories, he insists that 'if science is not to degenerate into a medley of ad hoc hypotheses, it must become philosophical and enter upon a thorough criticism of its own foundations'. Among the scientists who have felt this nee d, and who have taken pains to fulfil it, the late Professor A. Eddington obtains an eminent position. Among his relevant utterances we will quote here the followi ng, because it contains a concrete statement concerning the field of external observati on which forms the basis for the modern scientific world-picture. In his Philosophy of Physical Science we find him stating that 'ideally, all our knowledge of the universe could have been reached by visual sensation alone - in fact by the simplest form of visual sensation, colourless and non- stereoscopic'. 3 In other words, in order to obtain scientific cogniti on of the physical world, man has felt constrained to surrender th e use of all his senses except the sense of sight, and to limit even the act of seeing to the use of a sing le, colour-blind eye. Let us listen to yet another voice from th e ranks of present-day science, expressing a criticism which is symptomatic of our tim e. It comes from the late physiologist, Professor A, Carrel, who, concerning the e ffect which scientific research has had on man's life in general, says in his book, Man the Unknown: 'The sciences of inert matter have led us into a country that is not ours. ... Man is a stranger in the world he has created.' Of these utterances, Eddington's is at the present point of our discussion of special interest for us; for he outlines in it the pr ecise field of sense-perception into which science has withdrawn in the course of th at general retreat towards an ever more restricted questioning of nature which was noted by Heisenberg. The pertinence of Eddington's statement is shown immediately one considers what a person would know of the world if his only source of experience were the sense of sight, still further limited in the way Eddingt on describes. Out of everything that the world brings to the totality of our sens es, there remains nothing more than mere movements, with certain changes of rate , direction, and so on. The picture of the world received by such an observer is a purely kinematic one. And this is, indeed, the character of the world-picture of modern physical science. For in the scientific"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 treatment of natural phenome na all the qualities brought to us by our other senses, such as colour, tone, warmth, density and even electricity and magnetism, are reduced to mere movement-changes. As a result, modern science is prevented fr om conceiving any valid idea of 'force'. In so far as the concept 'force' appears in scien tific considerations, it plays the part of an 'auxiliary concept', and what man naively conceives as force has come to be defined as merely a 'descriptive law of behaviour'. We must leave it for later considerations to show how the scientific mind of man has created for itself the conviction that the part of science occupied with the actions of fo rce in nature can properly be treated with purely kinematic concepts. It is the fact itself which concerns us here. In respect of it, note as a characterist ic of modern text-books that th ey often simply use the term 'kinetics' (a shortening of kinematics) to designate the science of 'dynamics'. 4 In the course of our investigations we shal l discover the peculiarity in human nature which - during the first phase, now ende d, of man's struggle towards scientific awareness - has caused this renunciation of all sense-expe riences except those which come to man through the sight of a single co lour-blind eye. It will then also become clear out of what historic necessity this sel f-restriction of scientific inquiry arose. The acknowledgment of this necessity, however, must not prevent us from recognizing the fact that, as a result of this restrictio n, modern scientific research, which has penetrated far into the dynamic substrata of nature, finds itself in the peculiar situation that it is not at all guided by its own concepts, but by the very forces it tries to detect. And in this fact lies the root of the danger which besets the present age. 5 He who recognizes this, therefore, feel s impelled to look for a way which leads beyond a one-eyed, colour-blind conception of th e world. It is the aim of this book to show that such a way exists and how it can be followed. Proof will thereby be given that along this way not only is a true unde rstanding achieved of the forces already known to science (though not really understood by it), but also that other forces, just as active in nature as for example electri city and magnetism, co me within reach of scientific observation and understanding. And it will be shown that these other forces are of a kind that requires to be known to-day if we are to restore the lost balance to human civilization. * There is a rule known to physicians that 'a tr ue diagnosis of a case contains in itself the therapy'. No true diagnosis is possib le, however, without i nvestigation of the 'history' of the case. Applied to our task, this means that we must try to find an aspect of human development, both individual a nd historical, which will enable us to recognize in man's own being the cause responsible for th e peculiar narrowing of the scope of scientific inquiry, as desc ribed by the scientists cited above. A characteristic of scientific inquiry, distinguishing it fr om man's earlier ways of solving the riddles of the world, is that it admits as instruments of knowledge"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 exclusively those activities of the human soul over which we have full control because they take place in the full light of consciousness. This also explains why there has been no science, in the true sense of the word, prior to the beginning of the era commonly called 'modern' - that is, before the fifteenth century. For the consciousness on which man's scientific stri ving is based is itself an outcome of human evolution. This evolution, therefore, needs to be consid ered in such a way that we understand the origin of modern man's state of mind, and in particular why this state of mind cannot of itself have any other relati onship to the world than that of a spectator. For let us be clear that this peculiar relationship by no means belongs only to the scientifically engaged mind. Every adult in our age is, by virtue of his psycho- physical structure, more or less a world-spectator. What di stinguishes the state of man's mind when engaged in scientific observation is that it is restricted to a one-eyed colour-blind approach. * 'Death is the price man has to pay for his br ain and his personality' - this is how a modern physiologist (A. Carre l in his aforementioned book, Man the Unknown) describes the connexion between man' s bodily functions and his waking consciousness. It is character istic of the outlook prevailing in the nineteenth century that thinking was regard ed as the result of the life of the body; that is, of the body's matter-building processes. He nce no attention was paid at that time to the lonely voice of the German philosopher, C. Fortlage (1806-81), who in his System of Psychology as Empirical Science suggested that conscious ness is really based on death processes in the body. Fr om this fact he boldly drew the conclusion (known to us today to be true) that if 'partial death' gave rise to ordinary consciousness, then 'total death' must result in an extrao rdinary enhancement of consciousness. Again, when in our century Rudolf Steiner drew attention to the same fact, which he had found along his own lines of investigation, showing thereby the true role of the nervous system in regard to the various activ ities of the soul, offi cial science turned a deaf ear to his pronouncement. 6 To-day the scientist rega rds it as forming part of 'unknown man' that life must recede - in other words, that the organ-building processes of the body must come to a standsti ll - if consciousness is to come into its own. With the recognition of a death process in the nervous system as the bodily foundation of consciousness, and particularly of man's conceptual activities, the question arises as to the nature of those activities which have their foundation in other systems, such as that of the muscles, where life, not death, prevails. Here an answer must be given which will surprise the r eader acquainted with modern theories of psycho-physical interaction; but if he meets it with an open mind he will not find it difficult to test."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 Just as the conceptual activity has as its bodily foundation the brain, with the nervous appendages, so it is volitional activity whic h is based on processes taking place in the muscular region of the body and in those organs which provide the body's metabolism. A statement which says that man's will is as directly based on the metabolic processes of the body, both inside and outside the mu scles, as is his perceiving and thought- forming mind on a process in the nerves, is bound to cause surprise. Firstly, it seems to leave out the role commonly ascribed to the so-called motoric part of the nervous system in bringing about bodily action; and secondly, the acknowledgment of the dependence of consciousness on corporeal 'dying' implies that willing is an unconscious activity because of its being based on life processes of the body. The first of these two problems will find its answer at a later stage of our discussion when we shall see what entitles us to dr aw a direct connexion between volition and muscular action. To answer the second probl em, simple self-observation is required. This tells us that, when we move a limb, a ll that we know of is the intention (in its conceptual form) which rouses the will and gives it its direction, and the fact of the completed deed. In between, we accompany the movement with a dim awareness of the momentary positions of the parts of the body involved, so that we know whether or not they are moving in the intended manner. This awareness is due to a particular sense, the 'sense of movement' or 'muscu lar sense' - one of those senses whose existence physiology has lately come to acknowledge. Nothing, however, is known to us of all the complex changes which are set into play within the muscles themselves in order to carry out some intended move ment. And it is these that are the direct outcome of the activity of our will. Regarding man's psycho-physical organization thus, we come to see in it a kind of polarity - a death-pole, as it were, represented by the nerv es including their extension into the senses, and a life-pole, represen ted by the metabolic a nd muscular systems; and connected with them a pole of consciousness and one of unconsciousness - or as we can also say, of waking and sleepi ng consciousness. For the degree of consciousness on the side of the life-pole is not different from the state in which the entire human being dwells during sleep. It is by thus recognizing the dependence of consciousness on processes of bodily disintegration that we first come to understand why consciousness, once it has reached a certain degree of brightness, is bound to suffer repeated interruptions. Every night, when we sleep, our ner vous system becomes alive (though with gradually decreasing intensity) in order that what has been destroyed during the day may be restored. While the system is ke pt in this condition, no consciousness can obtain in it. In between the two polarically opposite syst ems there is a thir d, again of clearly distinct character, which functions as a me diator between the two. Here all processes are of a strictly rhythmic nature, as is shown by the process of breathing and the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 pulsation of the blood. This system, too, provides the foundation for a certain type of psychological process, namely feeling. That feel ing is an activity of the soul distinct from both thinking and willing, and that it has its direct counterpart in the rhythmic processes of the body, can be most easily tested through observing oneself when listening to music. As one might expect from its median position, the feeling sphere of the soul is characterized by a degree of consciousn ess half-way between waking and sleeping. Of our feelings we are not more conscious than of our dreams ; we are as little detached from them as from our dream experiences while these last; what remains in our memory of past feelings is usually not more than what we remember of past dreams. This picture of the threefold psycho-physical structure of man w ill now enable us to understand the evolution of consciousness both in individual life and in the life of mankind. To furnish the foundation of waki ng consciousness, parts of the body must become divorced from life. This process, how ever, is one which, if we take the word in its widest sense, we may call, ageing. All organic bodies, and equally that of man, are originally traversed throughout by life. Only gradually certain parts of such an organism become precipitated, as it were, from the general organic structure, and they do so increasingly towards the end of that organism's life-span. In the human body this separation sets in ge ntly during the later stages of embryonic development and brings about the first de gree of independence of bones and nerves from the rest of the organism. The retreat of life continues after birth, reaching a certain climax in the nervous system at a bout the twenty-first year. In the body of a small child there is still comparatively lit tle contrast between living and non-living organs. There is equally little contrast between sleeping and waking condition in its soul. And the nature of the soul at this stage is volition throu ghout. Never, in fact, does man's soul so intensively will as in the time when it is occupied in bringing the body into an upright position, and never again does it exert its stre ngth with the same unconsciousness of the goal to which it strives. What, then, is the soul's characteristic re lationship to the world around at this stage? The following observations will enable us to answer this question. It is well known that small children often a ngrily strike an object against which they have stumbled. This has been interpreted as 'animism', by which it is meant that the child, by analogy with his experience of hi mself as a soul-filled body, imagines the things in his surroundings to be similarly ensouled. Anyone who really observes the child's mode of experience (of which we as adults, indeed, keep something in our will-life) is led to a quite different interpretation of such a phenomenon. For he realizes that the child neither experiences himself as soul-entity distinct from his body, nor faces the content of the world in so detached a manner as to be in need of using his imagination to read into it a ny soul-entities distinct from his own."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 In this early period of his life the human bei ng still feels the world as part of himself, and himself as part of the world. Conseque ntly, his relation to the objects around him and to his own body is one and the same. To the example of the child beating the external object he has stumbl ed against, there belongs th e complementary picture of the child who beats himself because he has done something which makes him angry with himself. In sharp contrast to this state of oneness of the child's soul, in regard both to its own body and to the surrounding world, there sta nds the separatedness of the adult's intellectual consciousness, severed from bot h body and world. What happens to this part of the soul during its transition from one condition to the other may be aptly described by using a comparison from anot her sphere of natural phenomena. (Later descriptions in this book will show that a comparison such as the one used here is more than a mere external analogy.) Let us think of water in which salt has been dissolved. In this state the salt is one with its solvent; there is no visible distincti on between them. The situation changes when part of the salt crystallizes. By this proce ss the part of the salt substance concerned loses its connexion with the liquid and c ontracts into individually outlined and spatially defined pieces of solid matter. It thereby becomes optically distinguishable from its environment. Something similar happens to the soul with in the region of the nervous system. What keeps the soul in a state of unconscious ness as long as the body, in childhood, is traversed by life throughout, and what continue s to keep it in th is condition in the parts which remain alive after the separation of the nerves, is the fact that in these parts - to maintain the anal ogy - the soul is dissolved in the body. With the growing independence of the nerves, the soul itse lf gains independence from the body. At the same time it undergoes a process simila r to contraction whereby it becomes discernible to itself as an entity distinguish ed from the surrounding world. In this way the soul is enabled, eventually, to meet th e world from outside as a self-conscious onlooker. * What we have here described as the emer gence of an individual's intellectual consciousness from the original, purely volitio nal condition of the soul is nothing but a replica of a greater proce ss through which mankind as a whole, or more exactly Western mankind, has gone in the course of its historical development. Man was not always the 'brain-thinker' he is to-day. 7 Directly the separation of the nerve system was completed, and thereby the full cl arity of the brain-bound consciousness achieved, man began to concern himself with science in the modern sense. To understand why this science became restricted to one-eyed, colour-blind observation we need only apply to the human sense system, in particular, what we have learnt concerning man's threefold being."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 Sharply distinguished by their respective modes of functioning though they are, the three bodily systems are each spread out th rough the whole body and are thus to be found everywhere adjacent to each other. Hence, the corresponding three states of consciousness, the sleeping, dreaming and wa king, are also everywhere adjacent and woven into one another. It is the pred ominance of one or other which imparts a particular quality of soul to one or other region of the body. This is clearly shown within the realm of sense ac tivity, itself the most conscious part of the human being. It is sufficient to compare, say, the senses of sight and smell, and to notice in what different degree we are conscious of the impressions they convey, and how differently the corresponding elements of conception, feeling and willing are blended in each. We never turn away as instinctiv ely from objectionable colour arrangement as from an unpleasant smell. How small a part, on the other hand, do the representations of odours play in our recollec tion of past experiences, compared with those of sight. 8 The same is valid in descending measure for all other senses. Of all senses, the sense of sight has in gr eatest measure the qualities of a 'conceptual sense'. The experiences which it brings, and these alone, were suitable as a basis for the new science, and even so a further lim itation was necessary. For in spite of the special quality of the sense of sight, it is st ill not free from certain elements of feeling and will - that is, from elements with the ch aracter of dream or sleep. The first plays a part in our perception of co lour; the second, in observi ng the forms and perspective ordering of objects we look at. Here is repeated in a special way the thr eefold organization of man, for the seeing of colour depends on an organic process apart from the nerve processes and similar to that which takes place between heart and l ungs, whilst the seeing of forms and spatial vision depend upon certain movements of the eyeball (quick traversing of the outline of the viewed object with the line of si ght, alteration of the angle between the two axes of sight according to distance), in whic h the eye is active as a sort of outer limb of the body, an activity which enters our cons ciousness as little as does that of our limbs. It now becomes clear that no worl d-content obtained in such more or less unconscious ways could be made available fo r the building of a new scientific world- conception. Only as much as man experien ces through the sight of a single, colour- blind eye, could be used. 9 * If we would understand the role of sc ience in the presen t phase of human development, we must be ready to appl y two entirely different and seemingly contradictory judgments to one and the sa me historical phenomenon. The fact that something has occurred out of historical n ecessity - that is, a necessity springing from the very laws of cosmic evolution - does not save it from having a character which, in view of its consequences, mu st needs be called tragic. In this era of advanced intellectualism, lit tle understanding of the existence of true tragedy in human existence has survived. As a result, the word 'tragedy' itself has"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 deteriorated in its meaning and is nowadays used mostly as a synonym for 'sad event', 'calamity' 'serious event', even 'crime' (Oxford Diet.). In its original meaning, however, springing from the dramatic poetry of ancient Greece, the word combines the concept of calamity with that of inevitab ility; the author of the destructive action was not held to be personally responsible for it, since he was caught up in a nexus of circumstances which he could not change. This is not the place to discuss why trag edy in this sense forms part of man's existence. It suffices to ac knowledge that it does and, wher e it occurs, to observe it with scientific objectivity. Our considerations, starting from certain st atements made by some leading scientific thinkers of our time, have helped us not only to confirm the trut h inherent in these statements, but to recognize the facts stated by them as being the outcome of certain laws of evolution and thereby having an historic necessity. This, however, does not mean that man's scientific labours, ca rried out under the historically given restrictions, great and successf ul as these labours were and are, have not led to calamitous effects such as we found indicat ed by Professor Carrel. The sciences of matter have led man into a country that is not hi s, and the world which he has created by means of scientific research is not only one in which he is a stranger but one which threatens to-day to deprive him of his own ex istence. The reason is that this world is essentially a world of active forces, and the true nature of these is something which modern man, restricted to his onlooke r-consciousness, is positively unable to conceive. We have taken a first step in diagnosi ng man's present spiritu al condition. A few more steps are required to lead us to the point where we can conceive the therapy he needs. 1 This address and another by the same author are published together under the common title, Wandlungen in den Grundlagen der Naturwissenschaft ('Changes in the foundations of Natural Science'). Heisenberg's name has become known above all by his formulation of the so-called Principle of Indeterminacy. 2 See, in this respect, Faust's dispute with Mephistopheles on the causes responsible for the geological changes of the earth. (Faust II, Act 4) 3 See also Eddington's more elaborate description of this fact in his New Pathways in Science. The above statement, like others of Eddington's, has been Contested from the side of professional philosophy as logically untenable. Our own further di scussion will show that it accords with the facts. 4 Both words, kinematics and kinetics, are derivatives of the Greek word kinein, to move. The term 'kinematic' is used when motion is considered abstr actly without reference to force or mass. Kinetics is applied kinematics, or, as pointed out above, dynamics treated with kinematic concepts. 5 These last statements will find further illustration in the next two chapters. 6 First published in 1917 in his book Von SeelenrÃ¤tseln ."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 7 Homer's men still think with the diaphragm (phrenes). Similarly, the ancient practice of Yoga, as a means of acquiring knowledge, shows that at the time When it flourished man's conceptual activity was felt to be seated elsewhere than in the head. 8 This must not be confused with the fact th at a smell may evoke other memories by way of association. 9 For one who endeavours to observe historical facts in the manner here described, it is no mere play of chance that the father of scientific atomism, John Dalton, was by nature colour blind. In fact, colour blindness was known, for a considerable time duri ng the last century, as 'Daltonism', since it was through the publication of Dalton's self-observations that for the first time general attention was drawn to this phenomenon. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 CHAPTER III The Onlooker's Philosophic Malady In his isolation as world spectator, th e modern philosopher was bound to reach two completely opposite views regarding the obj ective value of human thought. One of these was given expression in Descartes' famous words: Cogito ergo sum ('I think, therefore I am'). Descartes (1596-1650), ri ghtly described as the inaugurator of modern philosophy, thus held the view that only in his own th ought-activity does man find a guarantee of his own existence. In coming to this view, Descartes took as his starting-point his experience that human consciousness contains only the thought pi ctures evoked by sense-perception, and yet knows nothing of the how and why of the things responsible for such impressions. He thus found himself compelled, in the first pl ace, to doubt whether any of these things had any objective existence, at all. Hence, there remained over for him only one indubitable item in the entire content of th e universe - his own thinking; for were he to doubt even this, he could do so only by again making use of it. From the 'I doubt, therefore I am', he was led in this way to the 'I think, therefore I am'. The other conception of human thought re ached by the onlooker-consciousness was diametrically opposed to that of Descartes, and entirel y cancelled its conceptual significance. It was put forward - not long afterwards - by Robert Hooke (1635- 1703), the first scientis t to make systematic use of the newly invented microscope by means of which he made the fundamental di scovery of the cellular structure of plant tissues. It was, indeed, on the strength of his microscopic studies that he boldly undertook to determine the relationship of human thought to objective reality. He published his views in the introduction to his Micrographia, the great work in which, with the lavish help of carefully ex ecuted copper engravings, he made his microscopic observations known to the world. Hooke's line of thought is briefly as follows: In past ages men subscribed to the naive belief that what they have in their cons ciousness as thought pi ctures of the world, actually reproduces the real content of that world. The microscope now demonstrates, however, how much the familiar appearance of the world depends on the structure of our sense apparatus; for it reveals a realm ju st as real as that already known to us, but hitherto concealed from us because it is not accessible to the natural senses. Accordingly, if the microscope can pe netrate through the veil of illusion which normally hides a whole world of potentially visible phenomena, it may be that it can even teach us something about the ideas we have hitherto formed concerning the nature of things. Perhaps it can bring us a step nearer the truth in the sphere of thought, as it so obviously has done in that of observation."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 Of all the ideas that human reason can form , Hooke considered the simplest and the most fundamental to be the geometrical concepts of point and straight line. Undoubtedly we are able to think these, but the naÃ ̄ve consciousness takes for granted that it also perceives them as objectiv e realities outs ide itself, so that thoughts and facts correspond to each other. We must now ask, however, if this belief is not due to an optical deception. Let us turn to the microscope and see what point and line in the external world look like through it. For his investigation Hooke chose the point of a needle and a kni fe-edge, as providing the best representatives among physical object s of point and straight line. In the sketches here reproduced we may see how H ooke made clear to his readers how little these two things, when obser ved through the microscope, resemble what is seen by the unaided eye. This fact convinced Hooke that the appa rent agreement between the world of perception and the world of ideas rests on nothing more so lid than an optical limitation (Plate I). Compared with the more refined methods of present-day thought, Hooke's procedure may strike us as somewhat primitive. Actually he did nothing more than has since been done times without number; for the scie ntist has become more and more willing to allow artificially evoked sense-percep tions to dictate the thoughts he uses in forming a scientific picture of the world. In the present context we are concerned with the historical import of Hooke's procedure. This lies in the fact that, imme diately after Descartes had satisfied himself that in thinking man had the one sure gua rantee of his own existence, Hooke proved in a seemingly indubitable manner that thi nking was entirely divorce d from reality. It required only another century for philosophy to draw from this the unavoidable consequence. It appeared in the form of Hume's philosophic system, the outcome of which was universal scepticism. As we shall see in due course, Hume's mode of reasoning continues to rule scientific thought even to-day, quite irrespective of the f act that science itself claims to have its philosophical parent in Kant, the very th inker who devoted his life's work to the refutation of Hume. * On the basis of his investigations into human consciousness Hu me felt obliged to reason thus: My consciousness, as I know it, has no contact with the external world other than that of a mere out side onlooker. What it wins for its own content from the outer world is in the nature of single, mu tually unrelated parts. Whatever may unite these parts into an objective whole within the world itself can never enter my consciousness; and any such unifying factor entertained by my thought can be only a self-constructed, hypothetical picture. Hu me summed up his view in two axioms which he himself described as the alpha a nd omega of his whole philosophy. The first runs: 'All our distinct perceptions are distin ct existences.' The other: 'The Mind never"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 perceives any real connexions be tween distinct existences.' (Treatise of Human Nature.) If once we agree that we can know of not hing but unrelated thought pictures, because our consciousness is not in a position to rela te these pictures to a unifying reality, then we have no right to ascribe, with Descarte s and his school, an objective reality to the self. Even though the self ma y appear to us as the unifying agent among our thoughts, it must itself be a mental picture among mental pictures ; and man can have no knowledge of any permanent real ity outside this fluctuati ng picture-realm. So, with Hume, the onlooker-consciousness came to experience its own utter inability to achieve a knowledge of the obj ective existence either of a material world be - behind all external phenomena, or of a spiritual self behind all the details of its own internal content. Accordingly, human consciousness found its elf hurled into the abyss of universal scepticism. Hume himself suffered unsp eakably under the impact of what he considered inescapable ideas - rightly descri bed from another side as the 'suicide of human intelligence' - and his philosophy often seemed to him like a malady, as he himself called it, against whose grip he could see no remedy. The only thing left to him, if he was to prevent philosophical suicide from ending in physical suicide, was to forget in daily life his own conclusions as far as possible. What Hume experienced as his philosophi cal malady, however, was the result not of a mental abnormality peculiar to himself, but of that modern form of consciousness which still prevails in general today. This explains why, despite all attempts to disprove Hume's philosophy, scientific t hought has not broken away from its alpha and omega in the slightest degree. A proof of this is to be found, for example, in the principle of Indeterminacy which has arisen in modern physics. * The conception of Indeterminacy as an una voidable consequence of the latest phase of physical research is due to Professor W. Heisenberg. Originally this conception forced itself upon Heisenberg as a result of experimental research. In the meantime the same idea has received its purely philo sophical foundation. We shall here deal with both lines of approach. After the discovery by Galileo of the parall elogram of forces, it became the object of classical physics - unexpressed, indeed, until Newton wrote his Principia - to bring the unchanging laws ruling nature into the light of human consciousness, and to give them conceptual expression in the langua ge of mathematical formulae. Since, however, science was obliged to restrict itself to what could be observed with a single, colour-blind eye, physics has taken as its main object of research the spatio- temporal relationships, and their changes, between discrete, idea lly conceived, point-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 like particles. Accordingly, the mathematically formulable laws holding sway in nature came to mean the laws according to wh ich the smallest particles in the material foundation of the world change their position wi th regard to each other. A science of this kind could logically maintain that, if ever it succeeded in defining both the position and the state of motion, in one singl e moment, of the to tality of particles composing the universe, it would have discovered the law on which universal existence depends. This necessarily rested on the presupposition that it really was the ultimate particles of the physical world wh ich were under observation. In the search for these, guided chiefly by the study of electricity, the physicis ts tracked down ever smaller and smaller units; and along this path scientific research has arrived at the following peculiar situation. To observe any object in the sense worl d we need an appropriate medium of observation. For ordinary things, light provi des this. In the sense in which light is understood to-day, this is possible because th e spatial extension of the single light impulses, their so-called wavelength, is immeasurably smaller than the average magnitude of all microscopically visible objects. This ensures that they can be observed clearly by the human eye. Much sm aller objects, however, will require a correspondingly shorter wave-length in the medium of observation. Now shorter wave-lengths than those of vi sible light have been found in ultra-violet light and in X- rays; and these, accordingly, are now often used for minute physical research. In this way, however, we are led by nature to a definite boundary; for we now find ourselves in a realm where the dimensi ons of the observation medium and the observed object are more or less the same. The result, unfortunately, is that when the 'light' meets the object, it changes the latt er's condition of movement. On the other hand, if a 'light' is used whose wave-lengt h is too big to have any influence on the object's condition of movement, it precludes any exact determination of the object's location. Thus, having arrived at the very ground of the world - that is, where the cosmic laws might be expected to reveal themselves di rectly - the scientist finds himself in the remarkable situation of only being able to determine accurately either the position of an observed object and not its state of motion, or its st ate of motion and not its position. The law he seeks, however, requires that both should be known at the same time. Nor is this situation due to the imperfection of the scientific apparatus employed, but to its very perfection, so that it appears to arise from the nature of the foundation of the world - in so far, at least, as modern science is bound to conceive it. If it is true that a valid scientific knowledge of nature is possible only in the sphere open to a single-eyed, colour-blind observation, and if it is true - as a science of this kind, at any rate, is obliged to believe - that all processes within the material foundation of the world depend on nothing but the movements of certain elementary particles of extremely small size, then the f act must be faced that the very nature of these processes rules out the discovery of any stable ordering of things in the sense of mathematically formulable laws. The discovery of such laws will then always be the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 last step but one in scientific investigatio n; the last will inevitably be the dissolution of such laws into chaos. For a consiste nt scientific thinking that goes this way, therefore, nothing is left but to recognize ch aos as the only real ba sis of an apparently ordered world, a chaos on whose surface the la ws that seem to hold sway are only the illusory picturings of the human mind. This, th en, is the principle of Indeterminacy as it has been encountered in the course of pr actical investigation into the electrical processes within physical matter. In the following way Professor Schroedinge r, another leading thinker among modern theoretical physicists, ex plains the philosophical ba sis for the principle of Indeterminacy, which scientists have established in the meantime: 1 'Every quantitative observation, every observa tion making use of measurement, is by nature discontinuous. ... However far we go in the pursuit of accuracy we shall never get anything other than a fin ite series of discrete results . ... The raw material of our quantitative cognition of nature will alwa ys have this primitive and discontinuous character. ... It is possible th at a physical system might be so simple that this meagre information would suffice to settle its fate; in that case nature would not be more complicated than a game of chess. To dete rmine a position of a game of chess thirty- three facts suffice. ... If nature is more comp licated than a game of chess, a belief to which one tends to incline, then a physica l system cannot be determined by a finite number of observations. But in practice a finite number of observations is all that we could make.' Classical physics, the author goes on to show, held that it was possible to gain a real insight into the laws of the universe, because in principle an infinite number of such discrete observations would enable us to f ill in the gaps sufficiently to allow us to determine the system of the physical worl d. Against this assumption modern physics must hold the view that an infinite numb er of observations cannot in any case be carried out in practice, and that nothing co mpels us to assume that even this would suffice to furnish us with the means for a complete determination, which alone would allow us to speak of 'law' in nature. 'This is the direction in which modern physics has led us without really intending it.' What we have previously sa id will make it clear enough that in these words of a modern physicist we meet once more the two fundamentals of Hume's philosophy. It is just as obvious, however, that the very pr inciple thus re-affirmed at the latest stage of modern physical science was already firm ly established by Hooke, when he sought to prove to his contemporaries the unreality of human ideas. Let us recall Hooke's motives and results. The human reason discovers that certain law-abiding forms of thought dwell within itself; these ar e the rules of mathematical thinking. The eye informs the reason that the same kind of law and order is present also in the outer world. The mind can think point and line; the eye reports that the same forms exist in nature outside. (Hooke could just as well have taken as his examples the apex and edge of a crystal.) The reason mistrusts the eye, however, and"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 with the help of the microscope 'improves' on it. What hitherto had been taken for a compact, regulated whole now collapses into a heap of unordered parts; behind the illusion of law a finer observation detects the reality of chaos! Had science in its vehement career from di scovery to discovery not forgotten its own beginnings so completely, it would not have n eeded its latest researches to bring out a principle which it had in fact been foll owing from the outset - a principle which philosophy had already recognized, if not in quite the same formulation, in the eighteenth century. Indeterminacy, as we have just seen it explained by Schroedinger, is nothing but the exact conti nuation of Humean scepticism. 1 In his book, Science and the Human Temperament (Dublin, 1935). "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 CHAPTER IV The Country that is Not Ours The last two chapters have served to s how the impasse into which human perception and thinking have come - in so far as they have been used for scientific purposes - by virtue of the relationship to the world in which man's consciousness found itself when it awoke to itself at the beginning of modern times. Now although the onlooker in man, especially in the earliest stage of our period, gave itself up to the conviction that a self-contained picture of the universe coul d be formed out of the kind of materials available to it, it neverthele ss had a dim inkling that this picture, because it lacked all dynamic content, had no bearing on the real na ture of the universe. Unable to find this reality within himself, the world-onlooker set about searching in his own way for what was missing, and turned to the perceptib le world outside man. Here he came, all unexpectedly, upon ... electricit y. Scarcely was electricity discovered than it drew human scientific thinking irresistibly into its own realm. There by man found himself, with a consciousness completely blind to dyna mics, within a sphere of only too real dynamic forces. The following description wi ll show what results this has had for man and his civilization. * First, let us recall how potent a role electricity has come to play in social life through the great discoveries which began at the e nd of the eighteenth century. To do this we need only compare the present relationshi p between production and consumption in the economic sphere with what it was befo re the power-machine, and especially the electrically driven machine, had been invented. Consider some major public undertaking in former times - say the cons truction of a great mediaeval cathedral. Almost all the work was done by human beings, with some help, of course, from domesticated animals. Under these circum stances the entire source of productive power lay in the will-energies of living be ings, whose bodies had to be supplied with food, clothing and housing; and to provide th ese, other productive powers of a similar kind were required near the same place. A ccordingly, since each of the power units employed in the work was simultaneously both producer and consumer, a certain natural limit was placed on the accumulation of productive forces in any one locality. This condition of natural balance be tween production and consumption was profoundly disturbed by the in troduction of the steam engine; but even so there were still some limits, though of a quite differe nt kind, to local concentrations of productive power. For steam engines require water and coal at the scene of action, and these take up space and need continua l shifting and replenishing. Owing to the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 very nature of physical matter, it cannot be heaped up where it is required in unlimited quantities. All this changed directly man succeeded in producing energy electro-magnetically by the mere rotation of material masses, and in using the water-power of the earth - itself ultimately derived from the cosmic energies of the sun - for driving his dynamos. Not only is the source of energy thus tapped pr actically inexhaustible, but the machines produce it without consuming on their own acco unt, apart from wear and tear, and so make possible the almost limitless accumulati on of power in one place. For electricity is distinguished from all other power-supplying natural fo rces, living or otherwise, precisely in this, that it can be concentrated spatially with the aid of a physical carrier whose material bulk is insignificant compared with the energy supplied. Through this property of electricity it has been possible for man to extend the range of his activity in all direc tions, far and near. So the ba lance between production and consumption, which in previous ages was more or less adequately maintained by natural conditions, has been entirely destroyed, and a ma jor social-economic problem created. In yet another way, and through quite another of its properties, el ectricity plays an important part in modern life. Not only doe s it compete with the human will; it also makes possible automatically intelligent operations quite beyond anything man can do on his own. There are innumerable examples of this in modern electrical technology; we need mention here only th e photo-electric cell and the many devices into which it enters. To an ever-increasing, quite uncontrolled de gree - for to the mind of present-day man it is only natural to tran slate every new discovery into practice as soon and as extensively as possible - electricity enters de cisively into our mode rn existence. If we take all its activities into account, we see arising amongst humanity a vast realm of labour units, possessed in their own way not only of will but of the sharpest imaginable intelligence. Although they are w holly remote from man's own nature, he more and more subdues his thoughts and actions to theirs, allowing them to take rank as guides and shapers of his civilization. Turning to the sphere of scientific researc h, we find electricity playing a role in the development of modern thinking remarkably similar to its part as a labour-force in everyday life. We find it associated with phe nomena which, in Professor Heisenberg's words, expose their mutual connexions to exact mathematical thinking more readily than do any other facts of nature; and ye t the way in which these phenomena have become known has played fast and loos e with mathematical thinking to an unparalleled degree. To recognize that in this sphere modern science owes its triumphs to a strange and often paradoxical mixture of outer accident and error in human thought, we need only review the hi story of the subject without prejudice. *"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 The discovery of electricity has so far b een accomplished in four clearly distinct stages. The first extends from the time when men first knew of electrical phenomena to the beginning of the natural scientific age; the second includes the seventeenth and the greater part of the eighteenth centuries ; the third begins with Galvani's discovery and closes with the first observations of radi ant electricity; and the fourth brings us to our own day. We shall here concern ourselves with a few outstanding features of each phase, enough to characterize the strange path along which man has been led by the discovery of electricity. Until the beginning of modern times, nothing more was known about electricity, or of its sister force, magnetism, than what we find in Pliny's writings. There, without recognizing a qualitative distin ction between them, he refers to the faculty of rubbed amber and of certain pieces of iron to attract other small pieces of matter. It required the awakening of that overruli ng interest in material nature , characteristic of our own age, for the essential difference between electric and magnetic attraction to be recognized. The first to give a proper de scription of this was Queen Elizabeth's doctor, Gilbert. His discovery was soon followed by the construction of the first electrical machine by the German Guericke (also known through his invention of the air pump) which opened the way for the discovery that electricity could be transmitted from one place to another. It was not, however, until the beginning of the eighteenth century that the crop of electrical discoveries began to incr ease considerably: among these was the recognition of the dual nature of electricity, by the Frenchman, Dufais, and the chance invention of the Leyden jar (made simulta neously by the German, von Kleist, and two Dutchmen, Musschenbroek and Cunaeus). Th e Leyden jar brought electrical effects of quite unexpected intensity within reach. Stimulated by what could be done with electricity in this form, more and more people now busied themselves in experimenting with so fascinating a force of nature, until in the second third of the century a whole army of observers was at work, whether by way of profession or of hobby, finding out ever new manife stations of its powers. The mood that prevailed in those days among men engaged in electrical research is well reflected in a letter written by the Englishman, Walsh, after he had established the electric nature of the shocks given by certain fishes, to Benjamin Franklin, who shortly before had discovered the natural o ccurrence of electricity in the atmosphere: 'I rejoice in addressing these communicati ons to You. He, who predicted and shewed that electricity wings the formidable bolt of the Atmosphere, will hear with attention that in the deep it speeds a humbler bolt, si lent and invisible; He, who analysed the electrical Phial, will hear with pleasure th at its laws prevail in animate Phials; He, who by Reason became an electrician, will he ar with reverence of an instinctive electrician, gifted in his birt h with a wonderful apparatus, and with the skill to use it.' (Phil. Trans. 1773.)"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 Dare one believe that in electricity the soul of nature had been discovered? This was the question which at that time stirred the he arts of very many in Europe. Doctors had already sought to arouse new vitality in their patients by the use of strong electric shocks; attempts had even been made to br ing the dead back to life by such means. . In a time like ours, when we are primarily concerned with the practical application of scientific discoveries, we are mostly accust omed to regard such flights of thought from a past age as nothing but the unesse ntial accompaniment of youthful, immature science, and to smile at them accordingly as historical curiosities. This is a mistake, for we then overlook how within them was hidden an inkling of the truth, however wrongly conceived at the time, and we ignore the role which such apparently fantastic hopes have played in connexion with the entr y of electricity into human civilization. (Nor are such hopes confined to the eighteen th century; as we shall see, the same impulse urged Crookes a hundred years later to that decisive discovery which was to usher in the latest phase in the history of science, a phase in which the investigating human spirit has been led to that boundary of the physical-material world where the transition takes place from inert matter into freely working energy.) If there was any doubt left as to whether in nature the same power was at work which, in animal and man, was hidden away within the soul, this doubt seemed finally to have been dispelled through Galvani's discovery that animal limbs could be made to move electrically through be ing touched by two bits of different metals. No wonder that 'the storm which was loosed in the world of the physicists, the physiologists and the doctors through Galvani's publication can on ly be compared with the one crossing the political horizon of Europe at the same time. Wherever there happened to be frogs and two pieces of different metals availabl e, everyone sought proof with his own eyes that the severed limbs could be marvellously re-enlivened.' 1 Like many of his contemporaries, Galvani was drawn by the fascinating behaviour of the new force of nature to carry on elect rical experiments as a hobby alongside his professional work, anatomical research. For his experiments he used the room where his anatomical specimens were set out. So it happened that his electrical machine stood near some frogs' legs, prepared for dissection. By a further coincidence his assistant, while playing with the machine, released a few sparks just when some of the specimens were in such contact with the surface bene ath them that they were bound to react to the sudden alteration of th e electric field round the machine caused by its discharge. At each spark the frogs' legs twitched. What Galvani saw with his own eyes seemed to be no less than th e union of two phenomena, one observed by Franklin in the heights of the atmosphere, th e other by Walsh in the depths of the sea. Galvani, as he himself describes, proceeded with immense enthusiasm to investigate systematically what accident had thus put into his hands. 2 He wanted first to see whether changes occurring naturally in the electrical condition of the atmosphere would call forth the same reac tion in his specimens. For th is purpose he fastened one end of an iron wire to a point high up outsi de his house; the lower end he connected with the nervous substance of a limb from one of his speci mens, and to the foot of this he attached a second wire whose othe r end he submerged in a well. The specimen"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 itself was either enclosed in a glass flask in order to insulate it, or simply left lying on a table near the well. And a ll this he did whenever a thunderstorm was threatening. As he himself reported: 'All took place as expected. Whenever the lightning flashed, all the muscles simultaneously came into repe ated and violent twitc hings, so that the movements of the muscles, like the flas h of the lightning, always preceded the thunder, and thus, as it were, heralded its coming.' We can have some idea of what went on in Galvani's mind during these experi ments if we picture vividly to ourselves the animal limbs twitching about every time the lightning flashed, as if a revitalizing force of will had suddenly taken possession of them. In the course of his investigations - he carried them on for a long time - Galvani was astonished to observe that some of his specimens, which he had hung on to an iron railing by means of brass hooks, sometimes fe ll to twitching even when the sky was quite clear and there was no sign of thunder. His natural conclusion was that this must be due to hitherto unnoticed electrical changes in the atmosphere. Observations maintained for hours every day, however, led to no conclusive result; when twitchings did occur it was only with some of the specimens, and even then there was no discoverable cause. Then it happened one day that Galvani, 'tired out with fruitless watching', took hold of one of the brass hooks by which the specimens were hung, and pressed it more strongly than usua l against the iron ra iling. Immediately a twitching took place. 'I was almost at th e point of ascribing the occurrence to atmospheric electricity,' Galvan i tells us. All the same he took one of the specimens, a frog, into his laboratory and there subjected it to similar conditions by putting it on an iron plate, and pressing agains t this with the hook that was stuck through its spinal cord. Immediately the twitchi ng occurred again. He tried with other metals and, for checking purposes, with non-metals as well. With some ingenuity he fixed up an arrangement, rather like that of an elec tric bell, whereby the limbs in contracting broke contact and in relaxing restored it, and so he managed to keep the frog in continuous rhythmical movement. Whereas Galvani had been rightly convinced by his earlier observations that the movement in the specimens represented a reaction to an electric stimulus from outside, he now changed his mind. In the very moment of his really significant discovery he succumbed to the error that he had to do with an effect of animal electricity located somewhere in the dead creature itself, perhaps in the fashion of what had been observed in the electric fish es. He decided that the metal attachment served merely to set in motion th e electricity within the animal. Whilst Galvani persisted in this mistake until his death, Volta reali zed that the source of the electric force, as in the first of Galvani's observations, must still be sought outside the specimens, and himself rightly attributed it to the contacting metals. Guided by this hypothesis, Volta started sy stematic research into the Galvanic properties of metals, and presently succeeded in producing electricity once more from purely mineral substances, namely from two different metals in contact with a conductive liquid."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 This mode of producing electricity, howeve r, differed from any previously known in allowing for the first time the production of c ontinuous electrical e ffects. It is this quality of the cells and piles constructed by Volta that laid open the road for electric force to assume that role in human civili zation which we have already described. That Volta himself was aware of this essentially new factor in the Galvanic production of electricity is shown by his own report to the Royal Society: 'The chief of my results, and which comp rehends nearly all the others, is the construction of an apparatus which resembles in its effects, viz. such as giving shocks to the arms, &c, the Leyden phial, and still be tter electric batteries weakly charged; . . . but which infinitely surpasses the virtue and power of these same batteries; as it has no need, like them, of being charged before hand, by means of a foreign electricity; and as it is capable of giving the usual co mmotion as often as ever it is properly touched.' Whilst Volta's success was based on avoi ding Galvani's error, his apparatus nevertheless turned out inadvertently to be a close counterpart of precisely that animal organ which Galvani had in mind when mi sinterpreting his own discoveries! That Volta himself realized this is clear from the concluding words in his letter: 'This apparatus, as it resembles more th e natural organ of the torpedo, or of the electrical eel, than the Leyde n Phial or the ordinary elec tric batteries, I may call an artificial electric organ.' This new method of producing continuous elec trical effects had far-reaching results, one of which was the discovery of the magne tic properties of the electric current by the Dane, Oersted - once again a purely acc idental discovery, moving directly counter to the assumptions of the discoverer himsel f. About to leave the lecture room where he had just been trying to prove the non- existence of such magnetic properties (an attempt seemingly crowned with success), Oersted happened to glance once more at his demonstration bench. To his astonishme nt he noticed that one of his magnetic needles was out of alignment; evidently it was attracted by a magnetic field created by the current running through a wire he ha d just been using, which was still in circuit. Thus what had escaped Oersted th roughout his planned researches - namely, that the magnetic force which accompanies an electric current must be sought in a direction at right angles to the current - a fortuitous event enabled him to detect. These repeated strokes of chance and fre quently mistaken interpretations of the phenomenon thus detected show that men we re exploring the elec trical realm as it were in the dark; it was a realm foreign to their ordinary ideas and they had not developed the forms of thought necessary for understanding it. (And this, as our further survey will show, is still true, even to-day.) In our historical survey we come next to the research es of Faraday and Maxwell. Faraday was convinced that if electrical processes are accompanied by magnetic forces, as Oersted had shown, the reverse must also be true - magnetism must be"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 accompanied by electricity. He was led to th is correct conviction by his belief in the qualitative unity of all the fo rces of nature - a reflexi on, as his biography shows, of his strongly monotheistic, Old Testament faith. Precisely this view, however - which since Faraday natural science has quite cons ciously adopted as a leading principle - will reveal itself to us as a fundamental error. It seems paradoxical to assert that the mo re consistently human thought has followed this error, the greater have been the results of the scien tific investigation of electricity. Precisely this paradox, however, is characte ristic of the realm of nature to which electricity belongs; and anyone earnestly s eeking to overcome the illusions of our age will have to face the f act that the immediate effectivene ss of an idea in practice is no proof of its ultimate truth. Another eloquent example of the strange de stiny of human thought in connexion with electricity is to be found in the work of Clark Maxwell, who, starting from Faraday's discoveries, gave the theory of electricity its mathematical basis. Along his purely theoretical line of thought he was led to the recognition of the existence of a form of electrical activity hitherto undreamt of - electro-magnetic vibrations. Stimulated by Maxwell's mathematical conclusions, Hert z and Marconi were soon afterwards able to demonstrate those phenomena which ha ve led on the one hand to the electro- magnetic theory of light, and on the other to the practical achievements of wireless communication. Once again, there is the para doxical fact that this out come of Maxwell's labours contradicts the very foundation on which he had built his theoretical edifice. For his starting-point had been to form a picture of the electro-magnetic field of force to which he could apply certain well-known formulae of mechanics. This he did by comparing the behaviour of the electrical force to the currents of an elastic fluid - that is, of a material substance. It is true that both he and hi s successors rightly emphasized that such a picture was not in any way meant as an explanation of electricity, but merely as an auxiliary concept in the form of a purely external analogy. Nevertheless, it was in the guise of a material fluid that he thought of this force, and that he could submit it to mathem atical calculation. Yet the fact is that from this starting-point the strict logic of mathematics led him to the discovery that electricity is capable of behaviour which makes it appear qualitatively similar to ... light! Whilst practical men were turning the work of Faraday and Maxwell to account by exploiting the mechanical working of electricity in power-production, and its similarity to light in the wireless comm unication of thought, a new field of research, with entirely new practical possibilities, wa s suddenly opened up in the last third of the nineteenth century through the discovery of how el ectricity behaves in rarefied air. This brings us to the discovery of cathode rays and the phenomena accompanying them, from which the latest stage in the hi story of electricity originated. And here once more, as in the history of Galvan i's discoveries, we encounter certain undercurrents of longing and expectation in the human soul which seemed to find an"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 answer through this sudden, great advan ce in the knowledge of electricity - an advance which has again led to practical ap plications of the utmost significance for human society, though not at all in the way first hoped for. Interest in the phenomena arising when el ectricity passes through gases with reduced pressure had simultaneously taken hold of se veral investigators in the seventies of the nineteenth century. But the decisive step in this sphere of research was taken by the English physicist, William Crookes. He was led on by a line of thought which seems entirely irrelevant; yet it was this which first directed his interest to the peculiar phenomena accompanying cathode rays; and they proved to be the starting-point of the long train of inquiry which has now culm inated in the release of atomic energy. 3 In the midst of his many interests and ac tivities, Crookes was filled from his youth with a longing to find by empirical means the bridge leading from the world of physical effects to that of superphysical cau ses. He himself tells how this longing was awakened in him by the loss of a much-bel oved brother. Before the dead body he came to the question, which thereafter was ne ver to leave him, whether there was a land where the human individuality continues af ter it has laid aside its bodily sheath, and how that land was to be found. Seeing that scientific re search was the instrument which modern man had forged to penetrate th rough the veil of external phenomena to the causes producing them, it was natural for Cr ookes to turn to it in seeking the way from the one world into the other. It was after meeting with a man able to pr oduce effects within the corporeal world by means of forces quite different from those familiar to science, th at Crookes decided to devote himself to this scientific quest. Thus he first came into touch with that sphere of phenomena which is known as spiritualism , or perhaps more suitably, spiritism. Crookes now found himself before a special order of happenings which seemed to testify to a world other than that open to our senses; physical matter here showed itself capable of movement in defiance of gravity, manifestations of light and sound appeared without a physical source to pr oduce them. Through becoming familiar with such things at seances arranged by his me diumistic acquaintance, he began to hope that he had found the way by which scientific research could overs tep the limits of the physical world. Accordingly, he threw hi mself eagerly into the systematic investigation of his new expe riences, and so became the fa ther of modern scientific spiritism. Crookes had hoped that the scien tists of his day would be pos itively interested in his researches. But his first paper in this fi eld, 'On Phenomena called Spiritual', was at once and almost unanimously rejected by his colleagues, and as long as he concerned himself with such matters he suffered through their opposition. It passed his understanding as a scientist why anything shou ld be regarded in advance as outside the scope of scientific research. After seve ral years of fruitless struggle he broke off his investigations into spiritism, deeply disillusioned at his failure to interest official science in it. His own partiality for it c ontinued, however (he served as President of the Society for Psychical Research fro m 1896-9), and he missed no opportunity of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 confessing himself a pioneer in the search for the boundary-land between the worlds of matter and spirit. Through all his varied scientific work the longing persisted to know more of this land. Just as Crookes had once sought to investig ate spiritism scientif ically, so in his subsequent scientific inquiries he was always something of a spiritist. He admitted, indeed, that he felt specially attracted by the strange light effects arising when electricity passes through rarefied gases, because they reminded him of certain luminous phenomena he had observed during hi s spiritistic inves tigations. Besides this, there was the fact that light here showed itself susceptible to the magnetic force in a way otherwise characteristic only of certain material substances. Accordingly, everything combined to suggest to Crookes that here, if anywhere, he was at the boundary between the physical and the supe rphysical worlds. No wonder that he threw himself into the study of these phenomena with enthusiasm. He soon succeeded in evoking striking effects - light and heat, and also mechanical - along the path of electricity passing invisibly through the t ube later named after him. Thus he proved for the first time visibly, so to say, the double nature - material and supermaterial - of electricity. What Crooke s himself thought about these discoveries in the realm of the cathode rays we may judge from the title, 'Radiant Matter', or 'The Fourth State of Matter', which he gave to his first publication about them. And so he was only being consistent when, in his le ctures before the Royal Institution in London, and the British Association in She ffield in 1879, after showing to an amazed scientific audience the newly discovered pr operties of electricity, he came to the climax of his exposition by saying: 'We have seen that in some of its properties Radiant Matter is as material as this table, whilst in other properti es it almost assumes the character of Radiant Energy. We have actually touched here the borderland where Matter and Force seem to merge into one another, the shadowy realm between Known and Unknown, which for me has always had peculiar temptations.' And in boldly prophetic words, which time has partly justified, he added, 'I venture to think that the greatest scientific problems of the future will find their solution in this Borderland, and even beyond; here, it seems to me, lie Ultimate Realities, subtle, far- reaching, wonderful.' No one can read these words of Crookes w ithout hearing again, as an undertone, the question which had forced itself on him at the bedside of his dead brother, long before. All that is left of the human be ing whom death has taken is a heap of substances, deserted by the force which had used them as the instrument of its own activity. Whither vanishes this force wh en it leaves the body, and is there any possibility of its revealing itself even without occupying such a body? Stirred by this question, the young Crookes set out to find a world of forces which differ from the usual mechanical ones exerci sed by matter on matter, in that they are autonomous, superior to matter in its in ert conglomeration, yet capable of using matter, just as the soul makes use of the body so long as it dwells within it. His aim was to secure proof that such forces exist, or, at any rate, to pe netrate into the realm"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 where the transition from matter to pure, matter-free force takes place. And once again, as in Galvani's day, electricity fasc inated the eyes of a man who was seeking for the land of the soul. What spiritism denied, electricity seemed to grant. The aversion to spiritism which Crookes met with in contemporary science was, from the standpoint of such a scie nce, largely justif ied. Science, in the form in which Crookes himself conceived it, took for gran ted that the relationship of human consciousness to the world was that of external onlooking. Accordingly, if the scientist remained within the limits thus prescribed for consciousness, it was only consistent to refuse to ma ke anything beyond these limits an object of scientific research. On the other hand, it says much for the courage and open mindedness of Crookes that he refused to be held back from what wa s for him the only possible way of extending the boundaries of science beyond the give n physical world. Moreover, it was only natural that in his search for a world of a higher order than the physical he should, as a man of his time, first turn his attention to spiritistic occurrences, for spiritism, as it had come over to Europe from America in the middle of the nineteenth century, was nothing but an attempt by the onlooker-cons ciousness to learn something in its own way about the supersensible world. The spiritist expects the spirit to reveal itself in outwardly perceptible phenomena as if it we re part of the physical world. Towards the end of his life Crookes c onfessed that if he were ab le to begin again he would prefer to study telepathic phenomena - the direct transference of thought from one person to another - rather than the purely mechanical, or so-called telekinetic, expressions of psychic forces. But although his interest was thus turning towards a more interior field of psychic investigati on, he remained true to his times in still assuming that knowledge about the world, wh atever it might be, could be won only by placing oneself as a mere onlooker outside the object of research. * The stream of new discoveries which followed Crookes's work justified his conviction that in cathode ray phenomena we have to do with a frontier region of physical nature. Still, the land that lies on the other side of this fr ontier is not the one Crookes had been looking for throughout his li fe. For, instead of finding the way into the land whither man's soul disappears at death, Crookes had inadvertently crossed the border into another land - a land which the twentieth-century scientist is impelled to call 'the country that is not ours'. The realm thrown open to science by Crookes's observations, which human knowledge now entered as if taking it by storm, was that of the radioactive processes of the mineral stratum of the earth. Many ne w and surprising properties of electricity were discovered there - yet th e riddle of electricity itsel f, instead of coming nearer, withdrew into ever deeper obscurity."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 The very first step into this newly disc overed territory made the riddle still more bewildering. As we have said, Maxwell's use of a material analogy as a means of formulating mathematically the properties of electro-magnetic fields of force had led to results which brough t electricity into cl ose conjunction with li ght. In his own way Crookes focused, to begin with, his attenti on entirely on the light -like character of electric effects in a vacuum. It was precisely these observations, however, as continued by Lenard and others, which presently made it necessary to see in electricity nothing else than a sp ecial manifestation of inert mass. The developments leading up to this stage are recent and familiar enough to be briefly summarized. The first step was once more an accident, when Roentgen (or rather one of his assistants) noticed that a bunch of keys, laid down by chance on top of an unopened box of photographic plates near a cathode tube, had produced an inexplicable shadow-image of itself on one of the plates. The cathode tube was apparently giving off some hitherto unknown t ype of radiation, capab le of penetrating opaque substances. Roentgen was an experiment alist, not a theorist; his pupils used to say privately that in publishi ng this discovery of X-rays he attempted a theoretical explanation for the first and only ti me in his life - and got it wrong! However, this accidental discovery had far-reaching consequences. It drew attention to the fluorescence of minerals placed in th e cathode tube; this inspired Becquerel to inquire whether naturally fl uorescent substances gave o ff anything like X-rays, and eventually - yet again by accident - he came upon certain uranium compounds. These were found to give off a radiation similar to X-rays, and to give it off naturally and all the time. Soon afterwards the Curies succeeded in isolating the element, radium, an element which was found to be undergoing a continuous natural disintegration. The way was now clear for that long series of experiments on atomic disintegration which led finally to the splitting of the nucleus and the construction of the atomic bomb. * A typical modern paradox emerges from th ese results. By restricting his cognitive powers to a field of experience in which th e concept of force as an objective reality was unthinkable, man has been led on a line of practical investig ation the pursuit of which was bound to land him amongst the fo rce-activities of th e cosmos. For what distinguishes electric and sub-electric activities from all other forces of physical nature so far known to science, is that fo r their operation they have no need of the resistance offered by space-bound material bodies; they represent a world of pure dynamics into which spatial limitations do not enter. Equally paradoxical is the situation of theo retical thinking in f ace of that realm of natural being which practical research has lately entered. We have seen that this thinking, by virtue of the consciousness on whic h it is founded, is impelled always to clothe its ideas in spatial form. Wherever anything in the pure spatial adjacency of physical things remains inexplicable, reso rt is had to hypothetical pictures whose content consists once more of nothing but spatially extended and spatially adjacent"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 items.

In so far as scientific thought has held to purely spatial conceptions, it has been obliged to concentrate on ever smaller and sm aller spatial sizes, so that the spatially conceived atom-picture has finally to reckon with dimensions wherein the old concept of space loses validity. When once th inking had started in this direction, it was electricity which once more gave it the strongest impulse to go even further along the same lines. Where we have arrived along this path is brought out in a passage in Eddington's The Nature of the Physical World. There, after describing the modern picture of electrons dancing round the atomic nucleus, he says: 'T his spectacle is so fascinating that we have perhaps forgotten that there was a tim e when we wanted to be told what an electron is. This question was never answer ed. No familiar conceptions can be woven round the electron; it belongs to the waiting list.' The only thing we can say about the electron, if we are not to deceive ou rselves, Eddington concludes, is: ' Something unknown is doing we don't know what .' 4 Let us add a further detail from this pict ure of the atom, as given in Eddington's Philosophy of Physical Science. Referring to the so-called positron, the positive particle regarded as the polar opposite of the negative electron, he remarks: 'A positron is a hole from which an electron has been removed; it is a bung-hole which would be evened up with its surroundings if an electron were inserted. ... You will see that the physicist allows hims elf even greater liberty than the sculptor. The sculptor removes material to obtain the form he de sires. The physicist goes further and adds material if necessary - an operation wh ich he describes as removing negative material. He fills up a bung-hole, saying he is removing a positron.' Eddington thus shows to what paradoxical ideas the scientis t is driven, when with his accustomed forms of thought he ventures into regions where the conditions necessary for such forms no longer exist; and he concludes his remarks with the following caution: 'Once again I would remind you that objective truth is not the point at issue.' By this reminder Eddington shows how fa r science has reconciled itself to the philosophic scepticism at which man's thi nking had arrived in the days of Hume. In so far as the above remark was intended to be a consolation for the bewildered student, it is poor comfort in the light of the actions whic h science has let loose with the help of those unknown entities. For it is just this resignat ion of human thought which renders it unable to cope with the flood of phenomena springing from the sub- material realm of nature, and has allowed scientific research to outrun scientific understanding. 1 E. du Bois-Raymond: Investigations into Animal Electricity (1884).

Goethe's paper wa s not destined to ra ise such a storm as soon followed Galvani's publication. And yet the fruit of Goethe's endeavours is not less significant than Galvani's discovery, fo r the progress of mankind. For in Goethe's achievement lay the seed of th at form of knowing which man requires, if in the age of the electrification of civilization he is to remain master of his existence. * Among the essays in which Goethe in later ye ars gave out some of the results of his scientific observation in axiomatic form, is one called 'Intuitive Judgment' ('Anschauende Urteilskraft'), in which he maintains that he has achieved in practice what Kant had declared to be for ever beyond the scope of the human mind. Goethe refers to a passage in the Critique of Judgment, where Kant defines the limits of human cognitional powers as he had observed them in his study of the peculiar nature of the human reason. We must first go briefly into Kant's own exposition of the matter. 1 Kant distinguishes between tw o possible forms of reason, the intellectus archetypus and the intellectus ectypus. By the first he means a reason 'which being, not like ours, discursive, but intuitive, proceeds from the synthetic universal (the intuition of the whole as such) to the particular, that is, from the whole to the parts'. According to Kant, such a reason lies outside human possibilities. In contrast to it, the intellectus ectypus peculiar to man is restricted to taking in through the senses the single details of the world as such; with these it can certain ly construct pictures of their totalities, but these pictures never have more than a hypothetical character and can claim no reality for themselves. Above all, it is not gi ven to such a thinking to think 'wholes' in such a way that through an act of thought alone the single items contained in them can be conceived as parts springing from them by necessity. (To illustrate this, we may say that, according to Kant, we can certainly comprehend the parts of an organism, say of a plant, and out of its co mponents make a picture of the plant as a whole; but we are not in a pos ition to think that 'whole' of the plant which conditions the existence of its organism and brings fo rth its parts by necessity.) Kant expresses this in the following way:"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 'For external objects as phenomena an adequate ground related to purposes cannot be met with; this, although it lies in nature, must be sought only in the supersensible substrata of nature, from all possible in sight into which we are cut off. Our understanding has then this p eculiarity as concerns the j udgment, that in cognitive understanding the particular is not determined by the universal and cannot therefore be derived from it.' The attempt to prove whether or not a nother form of reason than this (the intellectus archetypus) is possible - even though declared to be beyond man - Kant regarded as superfluous, because the fact was enough for hi m 'that we are led to the Idea of it - which contains no contradicti on - in contrast to our di scursive understanding, which has need of images (intellectus ectypus), and to the contingency of its constitution'. Kant here brings forward two reasons w hy it is permissible to conceive of the existence of an extra-human, archetypal re ason. On the one hand he admits that the existence of our own reason in its present cond ition is of a contingent order, and thus does not exclude the possible existence of a reason differe ntly constituted. On the other hand, he allows that we can think of a form of reas on which in every respect is the opposite of our own, without m eeting any logical inconsistency. From these definitions emerges a concepti on of the properties of man's cognitional powers which agrees exactly with those on which, as we have seen, Hume built up his whole philosophy. Both allow to the reason a knowledge-material consisting only of pictures - that is, of pict ures evoked in consciousness through sense-perception, and received by it from the outer world in th e form of disconnected units, whilst denying it all powers, as Hume expressed it, ever 'to perceive any real connections between distinct existences'. This agreement between Kant and Hume must at first sight surp rise us, when we recall that, as already mentioned, Kant work ed out his philosophy precisely to protect the cognizing being of man from the cons equences of Hume's thought. For, as he himself said, it was his becoming acquainted with Hume's Treatise that 'roused him out of his dogmatic slumber' and obliged him to reflect on the foundations of human knowing. We shall understand this apparent paradox, however, if we take it as a symptom of humanity's close imprisonment in recent centuries within the limits of its onlooker-consciousness. In his struggle against Hume, Kant was not concerned to cha llenge his opponent's definition of man's reasoning power. His sole object was to show that, if one accepted this definition, one must not go as far as Hu me in the application of this power. All that Kant could aspire to do was to protec t the ethical from attack by the intellectual part of man, and to do this by proving that the former belongs to a world into which the latter has no access. For w ith his will man belongs to a world of purposeful doing, whereas the reason, as our quotations have shown, is incapable even in observing external nature, of comprehe nding the wholes within nature which determine natural"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 ends. Still less can it do this in regard to man, a being who in his actions is integrated into higher purposes. Kant's deed is significant in that it correc tly drew attention to that polar division in human nature which, after all, was alrea dy established in Kant's own time. Kant demonstrated also that to win insight into th e ethical nature of man with the aid of the isolated intellect alone implied a trespass be yond permissible limits. In order to give the doing part of the human being its necessary anchorage, however, Kant assigned it to a moral world-order entirely external to man, to which it could be properly related only through obedient submission. In this way Kant became the philosopher of that division between knowledge and faith which to this day is upheld in both the ecclesiastical and scie ntific spheres of our civilization. Nevertheless, he did not su cceed in safeguarding humanity from the consequences of Hume's philosophy; for ma n cannot live indefinite ly in the belief that with the two parts of his own being he is bound up with two mutually unrelated worlds. The time when this was feasible is already over, as may be seen from the fact that ever greater masses of men wish to de termine their behaviour according to their own ideas, and as they see no alternative in the civilizat ion around them but to form ideas by means of the discursive reason which inevitably leads to agnosticism, they determine their actions accordingly. Meanwh ile, the ethical life as viewed by Kant accordingly shrinks ever further into a powerless, hole-and-corner existence. * It is Goethe's merit to have first shown that there is a way out of this impasse. He had no need to argue theoretically with Kant as to the justificat ion of denying man any power of understanding apart from the disc ursive, and of leaving the faculty of intuitive knowledge to a divinity somewh ere outside the world of man. For Goethe was his own witness that Kant was mistaken in regarding man's present condition as his lasting nature. Let us hear how he expr esses himself on this fact at the beginning of his essay written as an answer to Kant's statement: 'It is true, the author here seems to be poi nting to an intellect not human but divine. And yet, if in the moral sphere we are s upposed to lift ourselves up to a higher region through faith in God, Virtue and Immortality, so drawing nearer to the Primal Being, why should it not be likewise in th e intellectual? By contemplation (Anschauen) of an ever-creative nature, may we not make ourselv es worthy to be spir itual sharers in her productions? I at first, le d by an inner urge that would not rest, had quite unconsciously been seeking for the realm of Type and Archetype, and my attempt had been rewarded: I had been able to build up a description, in conf ormity with Nature herself. Now therefore nothing more could hi nder me from braving what the Old Man of the King's Hill 2 himself calls the Adventure of Reason.' Goethe started from the conviction that our se nses as well as our in tellect are gifts of nature, and that, if at any given mome nt they prove incapable through their"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 collaboration of solving a riddle of nature, we must ask her to help us to develop this collaboration adequately. Thus there was no question for him of any restriction of sense-perception in order to bring the latter in line with the existing power of the intellect, but rather to learn to make an ev er fuller use of the senses and to bring our intellect into line with what they tell. 'T he senses do not deceive, but the judgment deceives', is one of his basic utterances c oncerning their respective roles in our quest for knowledge and understanding. As to the senses themselves, he was sure that 'the human being is adequately equipped for all tr ue earthly requirements if he trusts his senses, and so develops them as to make them worthy of trust'. There is no contradiction in the statement that we have to trust our senses, and that we have to develop them to make them trus tworthy. For, 'nature speaks upwards to the known senses of man, downwards to unknown senses of his'. Goethe's path was aimed at wakening faculties, both perceptu al and conceptual, which lay dormant in himself. His experience showed him that 'e very process in nature, rightly observed, wakens in us a new organ of cognition'. Ri ght observation, in this respect, consisted in a form of contemplating nature which he called a 're-creating (c reating in the wake) of an ever-creative nature' (Nachschaffen einer immer schaffenden Natur). * We should do Goethe an injustice if we meas ured the value of his scientific work by the amount of factual knowledge he contributed to one or other sphere of research. Although Goethe did bring many new things to light, as has been duly recognized in the scientific fields concerned, it cannot be gainsaid that other scientists in his own day, working along the usual lines, far exceed ed his total of discoveries. Nor can it be denied that, as critics have pointed out, he occasionally went astr ay in reporting his observations. These things, however, do not de termine the value or otherwise of his scientific labours. His work draws its signifi cance not so much from the 'what', to use a Goethean expression, as from the 'how' of his observations, that is, from his way of investigating nature. Having once develope d this method in the field of plant observation, Goethe was able, with its aid, to establish a new view of animal nature, to lay the basis for a new meteorology, and, by creating his theory of light and colour, to provide a model for a research in the field of physics, free from onlooker- restrictions. In the scientific work of Goethe his botani cal studies have a speci al place. As a living organism, the plant is involved in an endl ess process of becoming. It shares this characteristic, of course, with the higher creatures of nature, and yet between it and them there is an essential difference. Wher eas in animal and man a considerable part of the life-processes conceal themselves w ithin the organism, in order to provide a basis for inner soul processes, the plant bri ngs its inner life into direct and total outer manifestation. Hence the plant, better than anything, could become Goethe's first teacher in his exercise of re-creating nature."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 It is for the same reason that we shall here use the plant for introducing Goethe's method. The following exposition, however, does not aim at rendering in detail Goethe's own botanical researches, e xpounded by him in two extensive essays, Morphology and The Metamorphosis of Plants, as well as in a series of smaller writings. There are several excellent translations of the chief paper, the Metamorphosis, from which the English-speaking r eader can derive sufficient insight into Goethe's way of expressing his ideas; a pleasure as well as a profit which he should not deny himself. Our own way of procedure will have to be such that Goethe's method, and its fruitfulness for the general advance of scien ce, come as clearly as possible into view. 3 Botanical details will be refe rred to only as far as seems necessary for this purpose. The data for observation, from which in Go ethe's own fashion we shall start, have been selected as best for our purpose, quite independently of the data used by Goethe himself. Our choice was determined by the ma terial available when these pages were being written. The reader is free to supplem ent our studies by his own observation of other plants. * Plates II and III show two series of leaves which are so arranged as to represent definite stages in the growth-process of the plant concerned. In each sequence shown the leaves have been taken from a single pl ant, in which each l eaf-form was repeated, perhaps several times, before it passed over in to the next stage. The leaves on Plate II come from a Sidalcea (of the mallow family ), those on Plate III from a Delphinium. We will describe the forms in sequence, so that we may grasp as clearly as possible the transition from one to anot her as presented to the eye. Starting with the right-hand l eaf at the bottom of Plate II, we let our eye and mind be impressed by its characteristic form, seeking to take hold of the pattern after which it is shaped. Its edge bears numerous inci sions of varying depths which, however, do not disturb the roundness of the leaf as a w hole. If we re-create in our imagination the 'becoming' of such a leaf, that is, its gradua l growth in all directions, we receive an impression of these incisions as 'negative' forms, because, at the points where they occur, the multiplication of the cells resu lting from the general growth has been retarded. We observe that this hol ding back follows a certain order. We now proceed to the next leaf on the same plate and observe that, whilst the initial plan is faithfully maintained, the ratio between the positive an d negative forms has changed. A number of incisions, hardly yet indicated in the first leaf, have become quite conspicuous. The leaf begins to look as if it were breaking up into a number of subdivisions. In the next leaf we find this process stil l further advanced. The large incisions have almost reached the centre, while a number of smaller ones at the periphery have also"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 grown deeper into the leaf. Th e basic plan of the total leaf is still maintained, but the negative forms have so far got the upper hand that the original roundness is no longer obvious. The last leaf shows the process in its ex treme degree. As we glance back and along the whole series of development, we recognize that the form of the last leaf is already indicated in that of the first. It appears as if the form has gradually come to the fore through certain forces which have increasingl y prevented the leaf from filling in the whole of its ground-plan with ma tter. In the last leaf the common plan is still visible in the distribution of the veins, but the fleshy part of the l eaf has become restricted to narrow strips along these veins. The metamorphosis of the delphinium leaf (P late III) is of a different character. Here the plant begins with a highly elaborate fo rm of the leaf, while in the end nothing remains but the barest indication of it. The impression received from this series of leaves is that of a gradual withdrawal of the magnificent form, revealed in its fullness only in the first leaf. A more intense impression of what these metamorphoses actually mean is achieved by altering our mode of contemplation in the following way. After repeated and careful observation of the different form s on either of the plates, we build up inwardly, as a memory picture, the shape of the first leaf, and then transform this mental image successively into the images of the ensuing forms until we reach the final stage. The same process can also be tried retrogressively, and so repeated forward and backward. This is how Goethe studied the doing of the plant, and it is by this method that he discovered the spiritual principle of all pl ant life, and succeeded also in throwing a first light on the inner life-principle of animals. * We chose the transformation of leaf forms into one another as the starting-point of our observations, because the principle of metamorphosis appears here in a most conspicuous manner. This principle, however , is not confined to this part of the plant's organism. In fact, all the different organs which the plant produces within its life cycle - foliage, calyx, corolla, organs of fertilization, fr uit and seed - are metamorphoses of one and the same organ. Man has long learnt to make use of this la w of metamorphosis in the plant for what is called doubling the flower of a certain species. Such a flower crowds many additional petals within its original circle, and these petals are nothing but metamorphosed stamens; this, for instance, is the differen ce between the wild and the cultivated rose. The multitude of petals in the latter is obt ained by the transformation of a number of the former's innumerable stamens. (Note the intermediate stag es between the two, often found inside the flower of such plants.)"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 This falling back from the stage of an organ of fertilization to th at of a petal shows that the plant is capable of regressive metamorphosis, and we may conclude from this that in the normal sequence the different or gans are transformed from one another by way of progressive metamorphosis. It is evident that the re gressive type occurs only as an abnormality, or as a result of artificia l cultivation. Plants once brought into this condition frequently show a general state of unrest, so that other organs also are inclined to fall back to a lower level. Thus we may come across a rose, an outer petal of which appears in the form of a leaf of the calyx (sepal), or one of the sepals is found to have grown into an ordinary rose leaf. We now extend our mental exercise to the plant's whole organism. By a similar mental effort as applied to the leaf-formati ons we strive to build up a complete plant. We start with the seed, from which we fi rst imagine the cotyledons unfolding, letting this be followed by the gradual development of the entire green part of the plant, its stem and leaves, until the final leaves change into the sepals of the calyx. These again we turn into the petals of the flower, until via pistil and stamens the fruit and seed are formed. By pursuing in this way the living doing of the plant from stage to stage we become aware of a significant rhythm in its total life cycle. This, when first discovered by Goethe, gave him the key to an understanding of nature's general procedure in building living organisms, and in maintaining life in them. The plant clearly divides into three major pa rts: firstly, the one that extends from the cotyledons to the calyx, the gree n part of the plant, that is , where the life principle is most active; secondly, the one comprising the flower itself with the organs of fertilization, where the vitality of the plant gives way to other principles; and lastly, the fruit and seed, which are destined to be discharged from the mother organism. Each of these three contains two kinds of organs: first, or gans with the tendency to grow into width-leaf, flower and fruit; second, organs which are outwardly smaller and simpler, but have the function of prep aring the decisive leaps in the plant's development: these are the calyx, the stamens, etc., and the seed. In this succession, Goethe rec ognized a certain rh ythm of expansion and contraction, and he found that the plant passes through it three times dur ing any one cycle of its life. In the foliage the plant expands, in th e calyx it contracts; it expands again in the flower and contracts in the pistil and st amens; finally, it expands in the fruit and contracts in the seed. The deeper meaning of this threefold rhyt hm will become clear when we consider it against the background of what we observed in the metamorphosis of the leaf. Take the mallow leaf; its metamorphosis shows a step-wise progression from coarser to finer forms, whereby the characteristic plan of the leaf comes more and more into view, so that in the topmos t leaf it reaches a certain stage of perfection. Now we observe that in the calyx this stage is not improved on, but that the plant recurs to a much simpler formation."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 Whilst in the case of the mallow the withdrawal from the stage of the leaf into that of the calyx occurs with a sudde n leap, we observe that the delphinium performs this process by degrees. Whilst the mallow reaches the highly elaborate form of the leaf only in the final stage, the de lphinium leaps forth at the outset, as it were, with the fully accomplished leaf, and then protract s its withdrawal into the calyx over a number of steps, so that this process can be watched with our very eyes. In this type of metamorphosis the last leaf beneath the calyx shows a form that differs little from that of a calyx itself, with its simple sepals. Only in its general geometrical arrangement does it still remind us of the original pattern. In a case like this, the stem-leaves, to use Goethe's expression, 'softly steal into the calyx stage'. 4 In the topmost leaf the plant ha s already achieved something which, along the other line of metamorphosis, is tackled only after the leaf plan itself has been gradually executed. In this case the ca lyx stage, we may say, is attained at one leap. Whatever type of metamorphosis is followe d by a plant (and there are others as well, so that we may even speak of meta morphoses between different types of metamorphosis!) they all obey the same basi c rule, namely, that before proceeding to the next higher stage of the cycle, the plan t sacrifices something already achieved in a preceding one. Behind the inconspicuous sheath of the calyx we see the plant preparing itself for a new creation of an en tirely different order. As successor to the leaf, the flower appears to us time and agai n as a miracle. Nothing in the lower realm of the plant predicts the fo rm, colour, scent and all the other properties of the new organ produced at this stage. The comple ted leaf, preceding the plant's withdrawal into the calyx, represents a triumph of st ructure over matter. Now, in the flower, matter is overcome to a still higher degree. It is as if the material substance here becomes transparent, so that what is im material in the plant may shine through its outer surface. * In this 'climbing up the spiritual ladder' Go ethe learned to recognize one of nature's basic principles. He termed it Steigerung (heightening). Thus he saw the plant develop through Metamorphosis and Height ening towards its consummation. Implicit in the second of these two principles, howev er, there is yet another natural principle for which Goethe did not coin a specif ic term, although he shows through other utterances that he was well aw are of it, and of its universal significance for all life. We propose to call it here the principle of Renunciation. In the life of the plan t this principle shows itself most conspicuously where the green leaf is heightened into the flower. While progressing from leaf to flower the plant undergoes a decisive ebb in its vitality. Compared with the leaf, the flower is a dying organ. This dying, however, is of a kind we ma y aptly call a 'dying into being'. Life in its mere vegetative form is here seen wit hdrawing in order that a higher manifestation of the spirit may take place. The same princi ple can be seen at work in the insect"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 kingdom, when the caterpillar's tremendous vita lity passes over in to the short-lived beauty of the butterfly. In the human being it is responsible for that metamorphosis of organic processes which occurs on the path from the metabolic to the nervous system, and which we came to recognize as the precondition for the appearance of consciousness within the organism. What powerful forces must be at work in th e plant organism at th is point of transition from its green to its coloured parts! They enforce a complete halt upon the juices that rise up right into the calyx, so that these bring nothing of their life-bearing activity into the formation of the flower, but under go a complete transmutation, not gradually, but with a sudden leap. After achieving its masterpiece in the fl ower, the plant once more goes through a process of withdrawal, this time into the ti ny organs of fertilization. (We shall return later to this essential stage in the life cycle of the plant, and shall then clear up the misinterpretation put upon it ever since sc ientific biology began.) After fertilization, the fruit begins to swell; once more the plan t produces an organ with a more or less conspicuous spatial extension. This is follo wed by a final and extreme contraction in the forming of the seed inside the fruit. In the seed the plant gives up all outer appearance to such a degree that nothing seems to remain but a small, insignificant speck of organized matter. Yet this tiny, in conspicuous thing bear s in it the power of bringing forth a whole new plant. In these three successive rhythms of expansi on and contraction the plant reveals to us the basic rule of its existence. During each expansion, the active pr inciple of the plant presses forth into visible appearance; during each contrac tion it withdraws from outer embodiment into what we may descri be as a more or less pure state of being. We thus find the spiritual principle of the plant engaged in a kind of breathing rhythm, now appearing, now disappeari ng, now assuming power over matter, now withdrawing from it again. In the fully developed plant this rhythm re peats itself three times in succession and at ever higher levels, so that the plant, in climbing from st age to stage, each time goes through a process of withdrawal before appear ing at the next. The greater the creative power required at a certain stage, the more nearly complete must be the withdrawal from outer appearance. This is why the most extreme withdrawal of the plant into the state of being takes place in the seed, when the plant prepares itself for its transition from one generation to another. Even earlier , the flower stands towards the leaves as something like a new generation springing from the small organ of the calyx, as does the fruit to the flower when it arises from the tiny organs of reproduction. In the end, however, nothing appears outwardly so unlike the actual plant as the little seed which, at the expense of all appearance, has the power to renew the whole cycle. Through studying the plant in this way Goethe grew aware also of the significance of the nodes and eyes which the plant develops as points where its vital energy is specially concentrated ; not only the seed, but the eye also, is capable of producing a"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 new, complete plant. In each of these ey es, formed in the axils of the leaves, the power of the plant is present in its entire ty, very much as in each single seed. In other ways, too, the plant shows its capacity to act as a whole at various places of its organism. Otherwise, no plant could be propagated by cuttings; in any little twig cut from a parent plant, all the manifo ld forces operative in the gathering, transmuting, forming of matter, that are necessary for the production of root, leaf, flower, fruit, etc., are potentially present, re ady to leap into acti on provided we give it suitable outer conditions. Other plants, su ch as gloxinia and begonia, are known to have the power of bringing forth a new, complete plant from each of their leaves. From a small cut applied to a vein in a l eaf, which is then embedded in earth, a root will soon be seen springing downward, a nd a stalk with leaves rising upward. A particular observation made by Goethe in this resp ect is of interest for methodological reasons. In the introduction to his treatise Metamorphosis of Plants, when referring to the regressive metamorphosis of stamens into petals as an example of an irregular metamorphosis, he remarks that 'experiences of this kind of metamorphosis will enable us to disclose wh at is hidden from us in the regular way of development, and to see clearly and visibly what we should otherwise only be able to infer'. In this remark Goethe expresses a tr uth that is valid in many spheres of life, both human and natural. It is frequently a pathological aberration in an organic entity that allows us to see in physical appearan ce things that do not come outwardly to the fore in the more balanced condition of normal development, although they are equally part of the regular organic process. An enlightening experience of this kind came to Goethe's aid when one day he happened to see a 'proliferated' rose (durchgewachsene Rose), that is, a rose from whose centre a whole new plant had sprung. In stead of the contracted seed-pod, with the attached, equally contracted, organs of fertilization, there appeared a continuation of the stalk, half red and ha lf green, bearing in successi on a number of small reddish petals with traces of anthers. Thorns coul d be seen appearing further up, petals half- turned into leaves, and even a number of fresh nodes from which little imperfect flowers were budding. The whole phenomenon, in all its irregularity, was one more proof for Goethe that the plant in its total ity is potentially presen t at each point of its organism. 5 * Goethe's observation of the single plant in statu agendi had trained him to recognize things of quite different outer appearance as identical in their inner nature. Leaf, sepal, petal, etc., much as they differ out wardly, yet showed themselves to him as manifestations of one and the same spir itual archetype. His id ea of Metamorphosis enabled him to reduce what in outer appear ance seems incompatibly different to its common formative principle. His next step was to observe the di fferent appearances of one and the same species in different re gions of the earth, a nd thus to watch the capacity of the species to respond in a comple tely flexible way to the various climatic"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 57 conditions, yet without concealing its inner identity in the varying outer forms. His travels in Switzerland and Italy gave him opportunity for such observations, and in the Alpine regions especially he was delighted at the variations in the species which he already knew so well from his home in Weimar. He saw their proportions, the distances between the single parts, the degr ee of lignification, the intensity of colour, etc., varying with the varied conditions, yet never concealing the identity of the species. Having once advanced in his investigations from metamorphosis in the parts of the single plant to metamorphosis among different representatives of single plant species, Goethe had to take only one further, entire ly decisive, step in order to recognize how every member of the plant kingdom is the manifestation of a single formative principle common to them all. He was t hus faced with the momentous task of preparing his spirit to think an idea from wh ich the plant world in its entire variety could be derived. Goethe did not take such a st ep easily, for it was one of his scientific principles never to think out an idea prematurely. He was we ll aware that he who aspires to recognize and to express in idea the spirit which reveals itself through the phenomena of the sense-world must develop the art of waiting - of waiting, however, in a way intensely active, whereby one looks again and yet again, until what one looks at begins to speak and the day at last dawns when, through tir eless 're-creation of an ever-creating nature', one has grown ripe to express her secrets openly. Goethe wa s a master in this art of active waiting. * It was in the very year that Galvani, through his chance discovery, opened the way to the overwhelming invasion of mankind by th e purely physical forces of nature, that Goethe came clearly to see th at he had achieved the goal of his labours. We can form some picture of the decisive act in the drama of his s eeking and finding from letters written during the years 1785-7. In the spring of 1785 he writes to a friend in a way that shows him fully aware of his new method of studying nature, which he recognized was a reading of her phenomena: 'I can't tell you how the Book of Nature is becoming readable to me. My long practice in spelling has helped me; it now suddenly works, and my quiet joy is inexpressible.' Again in the summer of th e following year: 'It is a growing aware of the Form with which again and again natu re plays, and, in playing, brings forth manifold life.' Then Goethe went on his famous journey to Italy which was to bear such significant fruit for his inner life, both in art and in science. At Michaelmas, 1786, he reports from his visit to the botanical garden in Padua that 'the thought becomes more and more living that it may be possible out of one form to develop all plant forms'. At this moment Goethe felt so near to the basic conception of the plant for which he was seeking, that he already christened it with a special name. The term he coined for it is"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 58 Urpflanze, literally rendered archetypal plant, or ur-plant, as we propose quite simply to call it. 6 It was the rich tropical a nd sub-tropical vegetation in the botanical gardens in Palermo that helped Goethe to his decisive observations. The peculiar nature of the warmer regions of the earth en ables the spirit to reveal itself more intensively than is possible in the temperate zone. Thus in tr opical vegetation many things come before the eye which otherwise remain undisclose d, and then can be detected only through an effort of active thought. From this point of view, tropical ve getation is 'abnormal' in the same sense as was the proliferated rose which confirmed for Goethe's physical perception that inner law of plant-growth which had already become clear to his mind. During his sojourn in Palermo in the spri ng of 1787 Goethe writes in his notebook: 'There must be one (ur-plant): how othe rwise could we recognize this or that formation to be a plant unless they were a ll formed after one patte rn?' Soon after this, he writes in a letter to the poet He rder, one of his friends in Weimar: 'Further, I must confide to you that I am quite close to the secret of plant creation, and that it is the simplest thing imaginable. The ur-plant will be the strangest creature in the world, for which nature herself should e nvy me. With this model and the key to it one will be able to invent plants ad infinitum; they would be consiste nt; that is to say, though non-existing, they would be capable of existing, being no shades or semblances of the painter or poet, but po ssessing truth and necessity. The same law will be capable of extension to all living things.' * To become more familiar with the conception of the ur-plant, let us bring the life- cycle of the plant before our inner eye once again. There, all the different organs of the plant-leaf, blossom, fruit, etc. - appear as the metamo rphic revelations of the one, identical active principle, a principle which gradually manifests itself to us by way of successive heightening from the cotyledons to the perfected glory of the flower. Amongst all the forms which thus appear in tu rn, that of the leaf has a special place; for the leaf is that organ of the plant in which the ground-plan of all plant existence comes most immediately to e xpression. Not only do all the di fferent leaf forms arise, through endless changing, out of each other, but the leaf, in accordance with the same principle, also changes itself into all the other organs which the plant produces in the course of its growth. It is by precisely the same principle that the ur-plant reveals itself in the plant kingdom as a whole. Just as in the single plant organism the different parts are a graduated revelation of the ur-plant, so ar e the single kinds and species within the total plant world. As we let our glance ra nge over all its ranks and stages (from the single-celled, almost formless alga to the rose and beyond to the tree), we are following, step by step, the revelation of the ur-plant. Barely hinting at itself in the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 59 lowest vegetable species, it comes in the ne xt higher stages into ever clearer view, finally streaming forth in full glory in the magnificence of the manifold blossoming plants. Then, as its highest creation, it bri ngs forth the tree, which, itself a veritable miniature earth, becomes the basis for innumerable single plant growths. It has struck biologists of Goethe's own a nd later times that contrary to their method he did not build up his study of the plant by starting with its lowest form, and so the reproach has been levelled against him of having unduly neglected the latter. Because of this, the views he had come to were re garded as scientifically unfounded. Goethe's note-books prove that there is no justification for such a reproach. He was in actual fact deeply interested in the lower plan ts, but he realized that they could not contribute anything fundamental to the spirit ual image of the plant as such which he was seeking to attain. To understand the plant he found himself obliged to pay special attention to examples in which it came to its most perfect expression. For what was hidden in the alga was made manifest in the rose. To demand of Goethe that in accordance with ordinary science he shoul d have explained nature 'from below upwards' is to misunderstand the methodologi cal basis of all hi s investigations. Seen with Goethe's eyes, the plant kingdom as a whole appears to be a single mighty plant. In it the ur-pla nt, while pressing into appearance, is seen to observe the very rule which we have found governing its action in the single plant - that of repeated expansion and contraction. 7 Taking the tree in the sense al ready indicated, as the state of highest expansion along th e ur-plant's way of entering into spatial manifestation, we note that tree-formation occurs successively at four different le vels - as fern-tree (also the extinct tree-form of the horsetail) among the cryptogams, as coniferous tree among the gymnosperms, as palm-tree among the monocotyledons, and lastly in the form of the manifold species of the leaf -trees at the highest level of the plant kingdom, the dicotyledons. All these levels ha ve come successively into existence, as geological research has shown; the ur-pla nt achieved these various tree-formations successively, thus giving up again its st ate of expansion each time after having reached it at a particular level. From the concept of the ur-plant Goethe soon learned to deve lop another concept which was to express the spiritual principle working in a particular plant species, just as the ur-plant was the spiritual principl e covering the plant ki ngdom as a whole. He called it the type. In the manifold types which are t hus seen active in the plant world we meet offsprings, as it were, of the mo ther, the 'ur-plant', which in them assumes differentiated modes of action. The present part of our discussion may be concluded by the introduction of a concept which Goethe formed for the organ of cognition attained th rough contemplating nature in the state of becoming, as the plant had taught him to do. Let us look back once again on the way in whic h we first tried to build up the picture of leaf metamorphosis. There we made use, fi rst of all, of exact sense-perceptions to which we applied the power of memory in its function as their keeper. We then"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 60 endeavoured to transform within our mind the single memory pictures (leaf forms) into one another. By doing so we applied to them the activity of mobile fantasy. In this way we actually endowed, on the one hand, objective memory, which by nature is static, with the dynamic properties of fantasy, and, on the other hand, mobile fantasy, which by nature is subjective, with the objective character of memory. Now, for the new organ of cognition arising from the union of these two polar faculties of the soul, Goethe coined the significant expression, exact sensorial fantasy. 8 In terms of our knowledge of man's psycho-physical make-up, acquired earlier, we can say that, just as the nervous system forms th e basis for memory, and the blood the basis for fantasy, so the 'exact sensorial fantasy' is based on a newly created collaboration of the two. * Our observations have reached a point where we may consider that stage in the life cycle of the single plant where, by means of the process of pollination, the seed acquires the capacity to produce out of its elf a new example of the species. Our discussion of this will bring home the fundame ntal difference in idea that arises when, instead of judging a process from the sta ndpoint of the mere onlooker, we try to comprehend it through re-creating it inwardly. Biological science of our day takes it for granted that the process uniting pollen with seed in the plant is an ac t of fertilization analogous to that which occurs among the higher organisms of nature. Now it is not to be gainsaid that to external observation this comparison seems obvious, and that it is therefore only natural to speak of the pollen as the male, and of the ovule as the female, element, and of their union as entirely parallel to that between the sexes in the higher kingdoms of nature. Goethe confesses that at first he himsel f 'had credulously put up with the ruling dogma of sexuality'. He was first made aware of the invalidit y of this analogy by Professor Schelver who, as Superintendent of the Jena Botanical Institute, was working under Goethe's direction and had trained himself in Goethe's method of observing plants. This man had come to see th at if one held strictly to the Goethean practice of using nothing for the explanati on of the plant but wh at one could read from the plant itself, one must not ascribe to it any sexua l process. He was convinced that for a Goethean kind of biology it must be possible to find, even for the process of pollination, an idea derived from nothing but the two principles of plant life: growth and formation. Goethe immediately recognized the Tightness of this thou ght, and set about the task of relating the pollination pro cess to the picture of the pl ant which his investigations had already yielded. His way of reporting the result show s how fully conscious he was of its revolutionary nature. Nor was he in any doubt as to the kind of reception it would be given by official biology."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 61 In observing the growth of the plant, Go ethe had perceived that this proceeds simultaneously according to two different principles. On the one hand the plant grows in an axial direction and thereby produces its main and side stems. To this growth principle Goethe gave the na me 'vertical tendency'. Were the plant to follow this principle only, its lateral s hoots would all stand vertically one above the other. But observation shows that the diffe rent plant species obey very different laws in this respect, as may be seen if one links up all the leaf buds along any plant stem; they form a line which winds spiral fashion around it. Each plant family is distinguishable by its own characteristic spiral, which can be represented either geometrically by a diagram, or arithmetically by a fraction. If, fo r example, the leaves are so arranged in a plant that every fifth leaf recurs on th e same side of the stem, while the spiral connecting the five successive leaf-buds wi nds twice round the stem, this is expressed in botany by the fraction 2 / 5. To distinguish this principle of pl ant growth from the vertical tendency, Goethe used the term 'spiral tendency'. To help towards a clear understanding of both tendencies, Goethe describes an exercise which is characteristic of his wa y of schooling himself in what he called exact sensorial fantasy. He first looks out for a phenomenon in which the 'secret' of the spiral tendency is made 'open'. This he finds in such a plant as the convolvulus; in this kind of plant the vertic al tendency is lacking, and the spiral principle comes obviously into outer view. Accordingly, the co nvolvulus requires an external support, around which it can wind itself. Goethe now suggests that after looking at a convolvulus as it grows upwards around its supp ort, one should first make this clearly present to one's inner eye, and then agai n picture the plant's growth without the vertical support, allowing instead the upward-growing plant inwardly to produce a vertical support for itself. By way of inwa rd re-creation (which the reader should not fail to carry out himself) Goethe attained a clear experience of how, in all those plants which in growing upwards produce their leaves spiral-wise around the stem, the vertical and spiral tend encies work together. In following the two growth-principles, Goet he saw that the vertical comes to a halt in the blossom; the straight line here sh rinks together, so to say, into a point, surviving only in the ovary and pistil as c ontinuations of the plant's stalk. The spiral tendency, on the other hand, is to be found in the circle of the stamens arranged around these; the process which in the leav es strove outwards in spiral succession around a straight line is now telescoped on to a single plane. In other words, the vertical-spiral growth of the plant here separates into it s two components. And when a pollen grain lands on a pistil and joins with the ovule prepared in the ovary, the two components are united again. Out of the now complete seed a new and complete plant can arise. Goethe understood that he would be taught a correct conception of this process only by the plant itself. Accordingly, he asked himself where else in the growing plant something like separation and reunion could be seen. This he found in the branching and reuniting of the veins in the leaves, known as anastomosis."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 In the dividing of the two growth-principle s in the plant through the formation of carpel and pistil, on the one hand, and the pol len-bearing stamens on the other, and in their reunion through the co ming together of the pollen with the seed, Goethe recognized a metamorphosis of the process of anastomosis at a higher level. His vision of it caused him to term it 'spiritual anastomosis'. Goethe held a lofty and comprehensive vi ew of the significance of the male and female principles as spiritual opposit es in the cosmos. Among the various manifestations of this polarity in earth ly nature he found one, but one only, in the duality of the sexes as char acteristic of man and anim al. Nothing compelled him, therefore, to ascribe it in the same form to the plant. This enabled him to discover how the plant bore the same polarity in plant fashion. In the neighbourhood of Weimar, Goethe of ten watched a vine slinging its foliaged stem about the trunk and branches of an el m tree. In this impressive sight nature offered him a picture of 'the female and male, the one that needs and the one that gives, side by side in the ve rtical and spiral directions'. Thus his artist's eye clearly detected in the upward striving of the plant a decisively masculine principle, and in its spiral winding an equally definite feminine principle. Since in the normal plant both principles are inwardly connected, 'we can re present vegetation as a whole as being in a secret androgynous union from the root up. From this union, through the changes of growth, both systems break away into ope n polarity and so stand in decisive opposition to each other, only to unite again in a higher sense.' Thus Goethe found himself led to ideas rega rding the male and female principles in the plant, which were the ex act opposite of those one obtai ns if, in trying to explain the process of pollination, one does not keep to the plant itself but imports an analogy from another kingdom of nature. For in cont inuance of the vertical principle of the plant, the pistil and carpel represent the male aspect in the process of spiritual anastomosis, and the mobile, wind- or inse ct-borne pollen, in c ontinuing the spiral principle, represents the female part. If the process of pollination is what the plant tells us it is, then the question arises as to the reason for the occurrence of such a process in the life cycle of the fully developed plant. Goethe himself has not e xpressed himself explicitly on this subject. But his term 'spiritual anastomosis' shows that he had some definite idea about it. Let us picture in our mind what happens physically in the plant as a result of pollination and then try to read from this picture, as from a hieroglyph, what act of the spiritual principle in the plant come s to expression through it. Without pollination there is no ripening of the seed. Ripening means for the seed its acquisition of the power to bring forth a new and independent plant organism through which the species continues its existence with in nature. In the life cycle of the plant this event takes place after the organism has reached its highest degree of physical perfection. When we now read these facts in the light of the know ledge that they are deeds of the activity of the type, we may describe them as follows:"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63 Stage by stage the type expends itself in ever more elaborate forms of appearance, until in the blossom a triumph of form over matter is reached. A mere continuation of this path could lead to nothing but a loss of all connexion between the plant's superphysical and physical component parts. Thus, to guarantee for the species its continuation in a new generation, the formative power of the type must find a way of linking itself anew to some pa rt of the plant's materiality. This is achieved by the plant's abandoning the union between its two polar growth-p rinciples and re- establishing it again, which in the majority of cases takes place even in such a way that the bearers of the two principles originate from two different organisms. By picturing the process in this way we are brought face to face with a rule of nature which, once we have recognized it, proves to ho ld sway at all levels of organic nature. In general terms it may be expressed as follows: In order that spiritual continuity may be maintained within the coming and going multitude of nature's creations, the physical stream must suffer discontinuity at certain intervals. In the case of the plant this discontinuity is achieved by the breaking asunder of the male and female growth-principles. When they have reunited, the type begins to abandon either the entire old plant or at least part of it, according to whether the species is an annual or a pe rennial one, in order to concentrate on the tiny seed, setting, as it were, its living seal on it. This is as far as we can go in describing this mysterious process, at least at the present stage of our considerations. * Our pursuit of Goethe's way of observing th e life of the plant has brought us to a point where it becomes possible to rectify a widespread error concerning his position as an evolutionary theorist. Goethe has been honourably mentioned as a predecessor of Darwin. The truth is, that the idea of evolution emerging from Goethe's mode of regarding nature is the exact opposite of the one held by Darwin and - in whatever modified form - by his followers. A brief consideration of the Darwinian concepts of inheritance and adaptation will show this. Goethe's approach to his conception of th e type is clear evidence that he did not undervalue the factor of adaptation as a fo rmative element in nature; we have seen that he became acquainted with it in st udying the same plant species under different climatic conditions. In his view, however, ad aptation appears not as the passive effect of a blindly working, external cause, but as the response of the sp iritual type to the conditions meeting it from outside."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 The same applies to the c oncept of inheritance. Through inheritance Goethe saw single, accessory characteristic s of a species being carried over from one generation to the next; but never could th e reappearance of the basic fe atures of the species itself be explained in this way. He was sufficien tly initiated into nature's methods to know that she was not in need of a continuity of the stream of physical substance, in the sense of the theory of inheri tance, to guarantee a continua nce of the features of the species through successive generations, but that it was her craft to achieve such continuance by means of physical discontinuity. * Goethe was not temperamentally given to reflecting deliberately about his own cognitional processes. Moreover, the excess of reflexion going on around him in the intellectual life of his younger days inclin ed him to guard himself with a certain anxiety against philosophical cogitations. His words to a friend - 'Dear friend, I have done it well, and never reflected about thinking' - bring this home to us. If in his later years Goethe could become to some de gree epistemologically conscious of his spiritual achievements, as, for instance, his essay on Intuitive Judgment shows, he owed this to his friendship with Schiller, who became for him a kind of soul mirror, in which he could see the reflexion of his own processes of consciousness. Indeed, at their first personal encounter, significant as it was for their whole later relationship, Schiller - though all unconscious ly - performed a decisive service of this kind for him. Goethe himself speaks of the occasion in his essay Happy Encounter (Gliickliches Ereignis), written twelve years after Schiller's death. The occasion was, outwardly regarded, fortuitous: both men were leaving a lecture on natural science at the University of Jena, Sc hiller having been pres ent as Professor of History in the University, and Goethe as its patron and as a Weimar Minister of State. They met at the door of the lecture hall and we nt out into the street together. Schiller, who had been wanting to come into closer contact with Goethe for a long time, used the opportunity to begin a conversation. He opened with a comment on the lecture they had just heard, saying that such a piecemeal way of handling nature could not bring the layman any real satisfaction. Go ethe, to whom this remark was heartily welcome, replied that such a style of scie ntific observation 'was uncanny even for the initiated, and that there must certainly be another way altogether, which did not treat of nature as divided and in pieces, but presented her as wo rking and alive, striving out of the whole into the parts'. Schiller's interest was at once aroused by this remark, although as a thorough Kantian he could not conceal his doubts whether th e kind of thing indicated by Goethe was within human capacity. Goethe began to explain himself further, and so the discussion proceeded, until the speakers arrived at Schiller's house. Quite absorbed in his description of plant metamorphosis, Goet he went in with Schiller and climbed the stairs to the latter's study. Once there, he seized pen and paper from Schiller's writing desk, and to bring his conception of the ur-p lant vividly before his companion's eyes he made 'a symbolic plant appear with many a characteristic stroke of the pen'."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 Although Schiller had listened up to this poi nt 'with great interest and definite understanding', he shook his head as Goethe finished, and said - Kantian that he was at that time: 'That is no experience, that is an idea.' These words were very disappointing to Goethe. At once his old antipathy towards Schiller rose up, an antipathy caused by much in Schiller's public utterances which he had found distasteful. Once again he felt that Schiller and he we re 'spiritual antipodes, removed from each other by more than an earth diameter'. However, Goethe restrained his rising annoyance, and answered Schiller in a tranquil but determined manner: ' I am glad to have ideas without knowing it, and to see them with my very eyes.' Although at this meeting Goethe and Schiller came to no real agreement, the personal relationship formed through it did not break off; both had become aware of the value of each to the other. For Goethe his first meeting with Schiller had the significant result of showing him that 't hinking about thought' could be fruitful. For Schiller this significance consisted in his having met in Goethe a human intellect which, simply by its existing properties, invalidated Kant's philosophy. For him Goethe's mind became an object of empirical study on which he based the beginnings of a new philosophy free from onlooker-restrictions. An essay, written by Goethe about the same time as the one ju st quoted, shows how he came to think at a later date about the raising of human per ception into the realm of ideas. In this essay, entitled Discovery of an Excellent Predecessor , 9 Goethe comments on certain views of the botanist, K. F. Wolff, regarding the relationships between the different plant organs, which s eemed to be similar to his own, and at which Wolff had arrived in his own way. Wolff had risen up as an opponent of th e so-called preformation theory, still widespread at that time, according to which the entire plant with all its different parts is already present in embryonic physical form in the seed, and simply grows out into space through physical enlargement. Such a mode of thought seemed inadmissible to Wolff, for it made use of an hypothesis 'resting on an extra-sensible conception, which was held to be thinkable, although it could never be demonstrated from the sense world. Wolff laid it down as a funda mental principle of all research that 'nothing may be assumed, admitted or assert ed that has not been actually seen and cannot be made similarly visible to others'. Thus in Wolff we meet with a phenomenologist who in his way tried to oppose certain trends of contemporary biological thinking. As such, Wolff had made certain observations which caused him to ascribe to the plan t features quite sim ilar to those which Goethe had grasped under the conception of progressive and regressive metamorphos is. In this way Wolff had grown convinced that all plant organs ar e transformed leaves. True to his own principle, he had then turned to the micros cope for his eyes to confirm what his mind had already recognized."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 66 The microscope gave him the confirmati on he expected by showing that all the different organs of the plant develop out of identical embryonic beginnings. In his absolute reliance on physical observation, howev er, he tried to go further than this and to detect in this way the reason why the plant does not always bring forth the same organ. He saw that the vegetative stre ngth in the plant diminishes in proportion as its organism enters upon its later stages. He therefore attribut ed the differentiated evolution of plant organs from identical beginnings to an ever weaker process of development in them. Despite his joy in Wolff as someone who in his own fashion had arrived at certain truths which he himself had also discovered, and despite his agreement with Wolff's phenomenalistic principle, Goethe coul d in no way accept his explanation of why metamorphosis took place in plants. He sa id: 'In plant metamorphosis Wolff saw how the same organ continuously draws together, makes itself smaller; he did not see that this contraction alternates with an expans ion. He saw that the organ diminishes in volume, but not that at the same time it ennobles itself, and so, against reason, he attributed decline to the path towards perfection.' What was it, then, which had prevented Wolff from seeing things arig ht? 'However admirable may be Wolff's method, through which he has achieved so much, the excellent man never thought that there may be a difference between seei ng and seeing, that the eyes of the spirit have to work in perpetual living connecti on with those of the body, for one otherwise risks seeing and yet seeing past a thing (zu sehen und doch vorbeizusehen).' Wolff's case was to Goethe a symptom of the danger which he saw arising for science from the rapidly increasing use of the micr oscope (and similarly the telescope), if thinking was not developed correspondingly but left at the mercy of these instruments. His concern over the state of affairs speaks from his utterance: 'Microscopes and telescopes, in actual fact , confuse man's innate clarity of mind.' When we follow Goethe in this way he comes before us in characteristic contrast to Robert Hooke. We remember Hooke's micr oscopic 'proof of the unrelatedness of human thought to outer reality (Chapter III). There can be no doubt how Goethe, if the occasion had arisen, w ould have commented on Hooke's procedure. He would have pointed out that there would be no such thing as a knife with its line-like edge unless man were able to think the concept 'line', nor a needle with its point-like end unless he were able to think the concept 'poi nt'. In fact, knife and needle are products of a human action which is guided by these two concepts respectively. As such they are embodiments, though more or less imperf ect ones, of these concepts. Here too, therefore, just as Goethe had discovered it through his way of observing the plant, we see Ideas with our very eyes. What disti nguishes objects of this kind from organic entities, such as the plant, is the diffe rent relationship between Object and Idea. Whereas in the case of an organism the Idea actively indwells the object, its relationship to a man-made thing (and sim ilarly to nature's mineral entities) is a purely external one."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 Hooke, so Goethe would have argued, a llowed the microscope to confuse his common sense. He would have seen in him an example confirming his verdict that he who fails to let the eye of the spirit work in union with the eye of the body 'risks seeing yet seeing past the thing'. * 'Thus not through an extraordinary spiritua l gift, not through mo mentary inspiration, unexpected and unique, but through consistent work did I eventually achieve such satisfactory results.' These words of Goethe - they occur in his essay, History of my Botanical Studies, which he wrote in late r life as an account of his labours in this field of science - show how anxious he was that it should be rightly understood that the faculty of reading in the Book of Nature, as he knew it, wa s the result of a systematic training of his mind. It is important for our further studies to make clear to ourselves at this point the nature of the change which man must bring to pass within himself in order to brave Kant's 'adventure of reason'. Goethe's concept for the newly acquired faculty of cognition, exact sensoria l fantasy, can give us the lead. We remember that, to form this faculty, tw o existing functions of the soul, as such polarically opposite, had to be welded together - memory based on exact sense- perception and the freely working fantasy; on e connected with the nervous system of the body, the other with the blood. We also know from earlier considerations (Chapter II) that in the lit tle child there is not yet any such polarization, in body or soul, as there is in man's later life. Thus we see that training on Goethe's lines aims at nothing less than restoring w ithin oneself a condition which is natural in early childhood. In saying this we touch on the very fo undations of the new pathway to science discovered by Goethe. We shall hear mo re of it in the following chapter. 1 Critique of Judgment, II, 11, 27. Goethe chose the title of his essay so as to refute Kant by its very wording. Kant, through his inquiry into man's Urteilskraft, arrived at the conclusion that man is denied the power of Anschauung (intuition). Against this, Goethe puts his Anschauende Urteilskraft. 2 'Der Alte vom Koenigsberge' - a play upon words with the name of Kant's native town, KÃ¶nigsberg. 3 It is naturally to be expected that new light will also be thrown on the various realms of knowledge as such dealt with in these pages. 4 Delphinium, in particular, has the peculiarity (which it shares with a number of other species) that its calyx appears in the guise of a flower, whilst the actual flower is quite inconspicuous. 5 Goethe also describes a proliferated pink. 6 The terms 'primeval' or 'primordial' sometimes suggested for rendering the prefix 'ur' are unsuitable in a case like this. 'Primeval plant', for instance, used by some translators of Goethe, raises the misunderstanding - to which Goethe's concept has anyhow been subject from the side of scientific botany - that by his ur-plant he had in mind some primitive, prehistoric plant, the hypothetical ancestor in the Darwinian sense of the present-day plant kingdom."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 7 The following observation is not one made by Goethe himself. It is presented here by the author as an example of the heuristic value of Goethe's method of pictorial-dynamic contemplation of the sense- world. 8 'Exakte sinnliche Phantasie.' 9 Entdeckung eines trefflichen Vorarbeiters."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 69 CHAPTER VI Except We Become ... In this chapter we shall concern ourselves with a number of personalities from the more or less recent past of the cultural life of Britain, each of whom was a spiritual kinsman of Goethe, and so a living illustrat ion of the fact that the true source of knowledge in man must be sought, and can be found, outside the limits of his modern adult consciousness. Whilst none of them was a match for Goethe as regards universality and scientific lu cidity, they are all characte ristic of an immediacy of approach to certain essential truths, whic h in the sense we mean is not found in Goethe. It enabled them to express one or the other of these truths in a form that makes them suitable as sign-posts on our own path of exploration. We shall find repeated opportunity in the later pages of this book to remember just what these men saw and thought. The first is Thomas Reid (1710-96), th e Scottish philosopher and advocate of common sense as the root of philosophy. 1 After having served for some years as a minister in the Church of Scotland, Re id became professor of Philosophy at the University of Aberdeen, whence he was calle d to Glasgow as the successor of Adam Smith. Through his birth in Strachan, Kincar dine, he belonged to the same part of Scotland from which Kant's ancestors had come. Two brief remarks of Goethe show that he knew of the Scotsman's philosophy, and that he appreciated his influence on contemporary philosophers. 2 Reid, like his contemporary Kant, felt his philosophical conscien ce stirred by Hume's Treatise of Human Nature, and, like Kant, set himself the task of opposing it. Unlike Kant, however, whose philosophic system was designed to arrest man's reason before the abyss into which Hume threatened to cas t it, Reid contrives to detect the bridge that leads safely across this abyss. Even though it was not granted to him actually to set foot on this bridge (this, in his time, only Goethe managed to do), he was able to describe it in a manner especially helpful for our own purpose. The first of the three books in which Reid set out the results of his labours appeared in 1764 under the title, Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense. The other two, Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man and Essays on the Active Powers of Man, appeared twenty years later. In these books Reid had in view a more all-embracing purpose than in his firs t work. The achievement of this purpose, however, required a greater spiritual power than was granted to him. Comparing his later with his earlier work, Reid's biographer, A. Campbell Fraser, says:"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 'Reid's Essays form, as it were, the inner court of the temple of which the Aberdonian Inquiry is the vestibule. But the vestibule is a more finished work of constructive skill than the inner court, for the aged archite ct appears at last as if embarrassed by accumulated material. The Essays, greater in bulk, perhaps less deserve a place among modern philosophical classics than the Inquiry, notwithstanding its narrower scope, confined as it is to man's percepti on of the extended world, as an object lesson on the method of appeal to common sense.' Whilst the ideas of Kant, by which he tried in his way to oppose Hume's philosophy, have become within a shor t space of time the common possession of men's minds, it was the fate of Reid's ideas to find favour among only a restricted circle of friends. Moreover, they suffered decisive misunders tanding and distortion through the efforts of well-meaning disciples. This was because Kant's work was a late fruit of an epoch of human development which had lasted for centuries and in his time began to draw to its close, while Reid's work represents a seed of a new epoch yet to come. Here lies the reason also for his failure to de velop his philosophy beyond the achievements contained in his first work. It is on the latter , therefore, that we shall chiefly draw for presenting Reid's thoughts. * The convincing nature of Hume's argumenta tion, together with the absurdity of the conclusions to which it led, aroused in Reid a suspicion that the premises on which Hume's thoughts were built, and which he, in company with all his predecessors, had assumed quite uncritically, contained so me fundamental error. For both as a Christian, a philosopher, and a man in po ssession of common sense, Reid had no doubt as to the absurdity and destructiven ess of the conclusions to which Hume's reasoning had led him. 'For my own satisfaction, I entered into a serious examin ation of the principles upon which this sceptical system is built; and was not a little surprised to find that it leans with its whole weight upon a hypothesis, whic h is ancient indeed, and hath been very generally received by philosophers, but of which I could find no solid proof. The hypothesis I mean is, That nothing is perc eived but what is in the mind which perceives it: That we do not really percei ve the things that are external, but only certain images and pictures of them imprinted upon the mind, which are called impressions and ideas. 'If this be true, supposing certain impressions and ideas to exist presently in my mind, I cannot, from their existence, infer the ex istence of anything el se; my impressions and ideas are the only existences of which I can have any knowle dge or conception; and they are such fleeting and transitory bei ngs, that they can have no existence at all, any longer than I am conscious of them. So that, upon this hypothesis, the whole universe about me, bodies and spirits, s un, moon, stars, and earth, friends and relations, all things with out exception, which I imagined to have a permanent existence whether I thought of them or not vanish at once:"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71 'And, like the baseless fabr ic of this vision ... Le ave not a rack behind. 'I thought it unreasonable, upon the authorit y of philosophers, to admit a hypothesis which, in my opinion, overturns all philo sophy, all religion and virtue, and all common sense: and finding, that all the sy stems which I was acquainted with, were built upon this hypothesis, I resolved to enquire into this subject anew, without regard to any hypothesis.' The following passage from the first chapter of the Inquiry reveals Reid as a personality who was not dazzled to the same extent as were his contemporaries by the brilliance of the onl ooker-consciousness: 'If it [the mind] is indeed what the Treatise of Human Nature makes it, I find I have been only in an enchanted castle, impos ed upon by spectres and apparitions. I blush inwardly to think how 1 have been delude d; I am ashamed of my frame, and can hardly forbear expostulating with my destiny: Is this thy pastime, O Nature, to put such tricks upon a silly creature, and then to take off the mask, and show him how he hath been befooled? If this is the philosophy of human na ture, my soul enter thou not into her secrets. It is sure ly the forbidden tree of knowle dge; I no sooner taste it, than I perceive myself naked, and stript of all things - yea even of my very self. I see myself, and the whole frame of nature, shrink into fleeting ideas, which, like Epicurus's atoms, dance about in emptiness. 'But what if these profound disquisitions in to the first principles of human nature, do naturally and necessarily plunge a man into this abyss of scepticism? May we not reasonably judge from what hath happened? Des Cartes no sooner began to dig in this mine, than scepticism was ready to break in upon him. He did what he could to shut it out. Malebranche and Locke, who dug deeper, found the difficulty of keeping out this enemy still to increase; but they laboured honestly in the design. Then Berkeley, who carried on the work, despairing of securing a ll, bethought himself of an expedient: By giving up the material world, which he t hought might be spared without loss, and even with advantage, he hoped by an impre gnable partition to s ecure the world of spirits. But, alas! the Treatise of Human Nature wantonly sapped the foundation of this partition and drowned all in one universal deluge.' (Chapter I, Sections vi-vii.) What Reid so pertinently describes here as the 'enchanted castle' is nothing else than the human head, which knows of no occu rrence beyond its boundaries, because it has forgotten that it is only the end-produc t of a living existen ce outside of, and beyond, itself. We see here that Reid is gifted w ith the faculty of ente ring this castle without forfeiting his memory of the world outside; and so even from within its walls, he could recognize its true nature . To a high degree this helped him to keep free of those deceptions to which the majority of his c ontemporaries fell victim, and to which so many persons are still subject to-day. It is in this way that Reid could make it one of the cardinal principles of his observations to test all that the head thinks by relating it to the re st of human nature"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72 and to allow nothing to stand, which does not survive this test. In this respect the argument he sets over against the Cartesian, 'cogito ergo sum' is characteristic: ' \"I am thinking,\" says he, \"therefore I am\": a nd is it not as good reasoning to say, I am sleeping, therefore I am? If a body moves, it must exist, no do ubt; but if it is at rest, it must exist likewise.' The following summarizes the position to which Reid is led when he includes the whole human being in his philosophical inquiries. Reid admits that, when the consciousness that has become aware of itself surveys that which lies within its own horizon, it finds not hing else there but transient pictures. These pictures in themselves bring to th e mind no experience of a lasting existence outside itself. There is no firm evidence of the existence of either an outer material world to which these pictures can be related, or of an inner spiritual entity which is responsible for them. To be able to speak of an existence in either realm is impossible for a philosophy which confines its attention so lely to the mere picture-content of the waking consciousness. But man is not only a percipient being; he is also a being of will, and as such he comes into a relationship with the world whic h can be a source of rich experience. If one observes this relationship, one is bound to notice that it is based on the self- evident assumption that one possesses a las ting individuality, whose actions deal with a lasting material world. Any other way of behaviour would c ontradict the common sense of man; where we meet with it we are faced with a lunatic. Thus philosophy and common sense seem to stand in irreconcilable opposition to each other. But this opposition is only appare nt. It exists so long as philosophy thinks it is able to come to valid conclusions w ithout listening to the voice of common sense, believing itself to be too exalted to need to do so. Philosophy, then, does not realize 'that it has no other root but the principles of Common Sense; it grows out of them, and draws its nourishment from them: severe d from this root, its honours wither, its sap is dried up, it dies and rots.' (I, 5.) At the moment when the philosophical c onsciousness ceases to regard itself as the sole foundation of its existence and recogni zes that it can say nothing about itself without considering the source from which it has evolved, it attain s the possibility of seeing the content of its expe rience in a new light. For it is no longer satisfied with considering this content in the completed form in which it presents itself. Rather does it feel impelled to investigate the process wh ich gives rise to this content as an end- product (the 'impressions' and 'ideas ' of Hume and his predecessors). Reid has faith in the fact - for his common sense assures him of it - that a lasting substantiality lies behind the world of the senses, even if for human consciousness it exists only so long as impressions of it ar e received via the bodily senses. Similarly, he has faith in the fact th at his consciousness, although ex isting but intermittently, has as its bearer a lasti ng self. Instead of allowing this intuitively given knowledge to be"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 73 shaken by a mere staring at fugitive pictures, behind which the real existence of self and world is hidden, he seeks instead in both directions for the origin of the pictures and will not rest until he has found the las ting causes of their transient appearances. In one direction Reid finds himself led to the outer boundary of the body, where sense perception has its origin. This prompts him to investigate the per ceptions of the five known senses: smelling, tasting, hearing, touching and seeing, which he discusses in this order. In the other direction he finds hi mself led - and here we meet with a special attribute of Reid's whole philosophical out look - to the realm of human speech. For speech depends upon an inner, intellige nt human activity, which, once learnt, becomes a lasting part of man's being, qu ite outside the realm of his philosophizing consciousness, and yet forming an indispen sable instrument for this consciousness. The simplest human reasoning, prompted onl y by common sense, and the subtlest philosophical thought, both need language fo r their expression. Through his ability to speak, man lifts himself above an instinctiv e animal existence, and yet he develops this ability at an infantile stage, when, in so far as concerns the level of his consciousness and his relationshi p to the world, he hardly ri ses above the level of the animal. It requires a highly developed intelligence to probe the intricacies of language, yet complicated tongues were s poken in human history long before man awoke to his own individual intelligence. Just as each man learns to think through speaking, so did humanity as a whole. Thus speech can become a means for acquiring insight into the original form of human intelligence. For in speech the common sense of man, working unconsciously within him, meets the fully awakened philosophical consciousness. 3 The way in which the two paths of observati on have here been set out must not give rise to the expectation that they are discussed by Reid in a similarly systematic form. For this, Reid lacked the sufficient detachme nt from his own thoughts. As he presents his observations in the Inquiry they seem to be nothing but a systematic description of the five senses, broken into continually by linguistic considerations of the kind indicated above. So, for example, many of his more important statements about language are found in his chapter on 'Hearing'. Our task will be to summarize Reid's wor k, taking from his description, so often full of profound observations, only what is essentia l to illustrate his decisive discoveries. This requires that (keeping to Mr. Eraser's picture) we consider separately the two pillars supporting the roof of the temple 's forecourt: speech and sense-impressions. We will start with speech. * Reid notes as a fundamental characteristic of human language th at it includes two distinct elements: first, the purely ac oustic element, represented by the sheer succession of sounds, and secondly the variet y of meanings represented by various groups of sounds, meanings which seem to have nothing to do with the sounds as"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 such. This state of language, where the s ound-value of the word and its value as a sign to denote a thing signified by it, have little or nothing to do with one another, is certainly not the primeval one. In the c ontemporary state of language, which Reid calls artificial language, we must see a development from a former condition, which Reid calls natural language. So long as this latter condi tion obtained, man expressed in the sound itself what he felt impelled to communicate to his fellows. In those days sound was not merely an abstract sig n, but a gesture, which moreover was accompanied and supported by the gestures of the limbs. Even to-day man, at the beginning of his life, still finds himself in that relationship to language which was natural to all men in fo rmer times. The little child acquires the ability to speak through the imitation of sounds, becoming aware of them long before it understands the meaning accorded to the va rious groups of sounds in the artificial state of contemporary adult speech. That the child's attention should be directed solely to the sound, and not to the abstract meaning of the individual words, is indeed the prerequisite of learning to speak. If, says Reid, th e child were to understand immediately the conceptual content of the words it hears, it would never learn to speak at all. When the adult of to-day uses language in it s artificial state, words are only signs for things signified by them. As he speaks, his attention is directed exclusively towards this side of language; the pure sound of the words he uses remains outside the scope of his awareness. The little child, on the other hand, has no understanding of the meaning of words and therefore lives comp letely in the experience of pure sound. In the light of this, Reid comes to the conclusion, so important for what follows, that with the emergence of a certain form of consciousness, in this case that of the intellectual content of word s, another form submerges, a form in which the experience of the pure sound of words prevails . The adult, while in one respect ahead of the child, yet in another is inferior, for the effect of this change is a definite impoverishment in soul-experience. Reid puts this as follows: 'It is by natural signs chiefly that we gi ve force and energy to language; and the less language has of them, it is the less expressive and pers uasive. ... Artificial signs signify, but they do not express; they speak to the understanding, as algebraic characters may do, but the passions and the affections and the will hear them not: these continue dormant and inactive, till we speak to them in the language of nature, to which they are all attention and obedience.' We have followed Reid so far in his study of language, because it is along this way that he came to form the concepts that were to serve him as a key for his all-important findings in the realm of sense-experience. These are the concepts which bear on the connexion between the sign and the thing signified; the distin ction between the artificial and the natural state of language ; and the disappearance of certain primeval human capacities for experience, of which Reid says that they are brought by the child into the world, but fade as his intellectual capacities develop."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 * As soon as one begins to study Reid's obser vations in the realm of sense-experience, one meets with a certain difficulty, noticeabl e earlier but not so strikingly. The source of it is that Reid was obliged to relate the results of his observati ons only to the five senses known in his day, whereas in fact his observations embrace a far greater field of human sense-perception. Thus a certain disharmony creeps into his descriptions and makes his statements less convinci ng, especially for someone who does not penetrate to its real cause. However this may be, it need not concern us here; what matter to us are Reid's actual observations. For these led him to the impor tant distinction betw een two factors in our act of acquiring knowledge of the outer world, each of which holds an entirely different place in ordinary consciousness. Re id distinguishes them as 'sensation' and 'perception'. It is through th e latter that we become awar e of the object as such. But we are mistaken if we regard the content of this perception as identical with the sum total of the sensations which are caused in our consciousness by the particular object. For these sensations are qualitatively so mething quite different, and, although without them no perception of the object is possi ble, they do not by themselves convey a knowledge of the thing perceived. Only, becau se our attention is so predominantly engaged by the object under perception, we pay no heed to the content of our sensation. To take an example, the impressions of roundness, angularity, smoothness, roughness, colour, etc., of a table contain, all told, nothing that could assure us of the existence of the object 'table' as the real content of an external world. How, then, do we receive the conviction of the latter's existence? Reid's answer is, by entering into an immediate intuitive relationship with it. It is true that to establish this relationship we need the stimuli coming from the impressions which our mind receives through the various senses. Yet this must not induce us to confuse the two. When nature speaks to man through his se nses, something occurs exactly analogous to the process when man communicates w ith man through the spoken word. In both cases the perception, that is, th e result of the pr ocess of perception, is something quite other than the sum of sensa tions underlying it. Per-ceiving by means of the senses is none other than a re-ceiving of nature's language; and th is language, just like human language, bears two entirely different elemen ts within it. According as one or the other element prevails in man's intercourse wi th nature, this intercourse will be either 'natural' or 'artificial' - to use the terms by which Reid distinguished the two stages of human speech. Just as every human being must once have listened only to the pure sound of the spoken word on a wholly sentient level in or der to acquire the f aculty of speaking, so also, in order to learn nature's language , the soul must once have been totally surrendered to the pure impre ssions of the senses. And ju st as with time the spoken word becomes a symbol for that which is si gnified by it, the cons ciousness turning to"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 the latter and neglecting the actual sound-content of th e word, so also in its intercourse with nature the soul, with its gr owing interest in the thing signified, turns its attention more and more away from the actual experiences of the senses. From this it follows that a philosophy whic h seeks to do justice to man's whole being must not be satisfied with examining the given content of human consciousness, but must strive to observe the actual process to which this content owes its emergence. In practice this means that a philosopher who unde rstands his task aright must strive to reawaken in himself a mode of experience which is naturally given to man in his early childhood. Reid expresses this in the Inquiry in the following way: 'When one is learning a language, he attends to the sounds, but when he is master of it, he attends only to the sense of what he would express. If this is the case, we must become as little children agai n, if we will be philosophers: we must overcome habits which have been gathering strength ever since we began to think; habits, the usefulness of which atones for the diffic ulty it creates fo r the philosopher in discovering the first princi ples of the human mind.' 'We must become as little children again, if we will be philosophers!' The phrase appears here almost in passing, and Reid neve r came back to it again. And yet in it is contained the Open Sesame which gives access to the hidden spirit-treasures of the world. In this unawareness of Reid's of the importance of what he thus had found we must see the reason for his incapacity to develop his philosophy beyond its first beginnings. This handicap arose from the fact that in all his thinking he was guided by a picture of the being of man which - as a child of his time, dominated by the contemporary religious outlook - he could neve r realize distinctly. Yet without a clear conception of this picture no justice can be done to Reid's concept of common sense. Our next task, therefore, must be to e voke this picture as clearly as we can The following passage in Reid's Inquiry provides a key for the understanding of his difficulty in conceiving an ad equate picture of man's being. In this passage Reid maintains that all art is based on man's expe rience of the natura l language of things, and that in every human being there lives an inborn artist who is more or less crippled by man's growing accustomed to the state of artificial language in his intercourse with the world. In continuation of the passage quoted on page 99 Reid says: 'It were easy to show, that the fine arts of the musician, the painter, the actor, and the orator, so far as they are expressive; alt hough the knowledge of them requires in us a delicate taste, a nice judgment, and much st udy and practice; yet they are nothing else but the language of nature, which we br ought into the world with us, but have unlearned by disuse and so find the greatest difficulty in recovering it. 'Abolish the use of articulate sounds a nd writing among mankind for a century, and every man would be a painter, an actor, a nd an orator. We mean not to affirm that such an expedient is practicable; or if it were, that the advantage would counterbalance the loss; but that, as men ar e led by nature and necessity to converse"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 together they will use every means in th eir power to make themselves understood; and where they cannot do this by artificial signs, they will do it as far as possible by natural ones: and he that understands perfec tly the use of natura l signs, must be the best judge in all expressive arts.' When Reid says that there are certain ch aracteristics - and th ese just of the kind whose development truly ennobles human life - which the soul brings with it into the world, a picture of man is evoked in us in wh ich the supersensible part of his being appears as an entity whose existence reaches further back than the moment of birth and even the first beginnings of the body. No w such a conception of man is in no way foreign to humanity, in more ancient times it was universally prevalent, and it still lives on to-day, if merely traditionally, in th e eastern part of the world. It is only in the West that from a certain period it ceas ed to be held. This was the result of a change which entered into human memory in historical times, ju st as the re-dawning of the old knowledge of man's pre-existence, of which Reid is a symptom, is a result of another corresponding alteration in the memory-powers of man in modern times. For men of old it was characteristic that alongside the impressi ons they received in earthly life through the senses (which in a ny case were far less intense than they are to-day), they remembered experiences of a purely supersensible kind, which gave them assurance that before the soul wa s knit together with a physical body it had existed in a cosmic state purely spiritual in nature. The moment in history when this kind of memory disappeared is that of th e transition from the philosophy of Plato to that of Aristotle. Whereas Plato was convi nced by clear knowledge that the soul possesses characteristics impl anted in it before concepti on, Aristotle recognized a bodiless state of the soul only in the life after death. For him the beginning of the soul's existence was identical with that of the body. The picture of man, taught for the first tim e by Aristotle, still required about twice four hundred years - from the fourth pre-Chri stian to the fourth post-Christian century - before it became so far the common possession of men that the Church Father Augustine (354-430) could base his teaching on it - a teaching which moulded man's outlook on himself for the coming centuries right up to our own time. The following passage from Augustine's Confessions shows clearly how he was compelled to think about the nature of the little child: 'This age, whereof I have no remembrance, which I take on others' words, and guess from other infants that I have passed, true though the guess be, I am yet loath to count in this life of mine which I live in this world. For no less than that which I lived in my mother's womb, is it hid from me in the sha dows of forgetfulness. But if I was shapen in iniquity and in sin my mother did con ceive me, where, I beseech thee, O my God, where, Lord, or when, was I thy servant gui ltless? But lo! that period I pass by; and what have I to do with that of which I can recall no vestige?' 4 "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 On the grounds of such experience, Augus tine was unable to picture man's being in any other way than by seeing him, from the firs t moment of his life, as subject to the condition of the human race which resulted from the Fall. Thus he exclaims in his Confessions: 'Before Thee, O God, no-one is free from sin, not even the child which has lived but a single day on the earth.' In so far as there was any question of the soul's arising from this fallen state, it was deemed unable to attain this by any effort of its own, but to depend on the gifts of gr ace which the Church was able to dispense through the Sacraments. Compare with this the present-day scient ific conception of human nature, as it dominates the thought of specialist and layman alike. Here man appears, both in body and soul, as a sum of inherited characteristics, of characteristics, that is to say, which have been passed on by way of sexual propagation and gradually emerge into full manifestation as the individual grows up. Apar t from this inherited predestination the soul is held to present itself, in Locke's classical phrase, as a tabula rasa upon which are stamped all manner of external impressions. The similarity between this modern picture of man and the earlie r theological one is striking. In both cases the cen tral assumption is that human development from child to man consists in the unfolding of certain inherited characteristics which are capable of further specific modification under infl uences proceeding from outside. The only difference between the two pictures is that in the modern one the concepts of heredity and adaptation have been formed without special application to the ethical characteristics of the soul. It is clear that from both Augustine's and th e modern scientific viewpoint there is no sense in requiring - as Reid did - those w ho seek the truth about themselves and the world to recover a condition which had been theirs as children. Nor from this point of view is there any justification to call on a Common Sense, innate in man, to sit in judgment on the philosophical e fforts of the adult reason. * That even in the days of Augustine the or iginal conception of human nature had not disappeared entirely, is shown by the a ppearance of Augustine's opponent Pelagius, called the 'arch-heretic'. To consider him at this point in our discussion will prove helpful for our understanding of Reid's historic position in the modern age. What interests us here in Pelagius's doc trine (leaving aside all questions concerning the meaning of the Sacraments, etc.), is th e picture of man which must have lived in him for him to teach as he did. Leaving his Irish-Scottish ho meland and arriving about the year 400 in Rome, where on account of the unusual purity of his being he soon came to be held in the highest esteem, Pelagius found himself obliged to come out publicly against Augustine, for he felt that Augustine's teachings denied all free will to man. In the purely passive"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 surrender of man to the will of God, as Augustine taught it, he could not but see danger for the future development of Chris tian humanity. How radically he diverged from Augustine in his view of man we may see from such of his leading thoughts as follow: 'Each man begins his life in the same condition as Adam.' 'All good or evil for which in life we are de serving of praise or blame is done by ourselves and is not born with us.' 'Before the personal will of man comes into action there is nothing in him but what God has placed there.' 'It is therefore left to the free will of man whether he falls into sin, as also whether through following Christ he rais es himself out of it again.' Pelagius could think in this way because he came from a part of Europe where the older form of human memory, already at that time almost extinct in the South, was in some degree still active. For him it was theref ore a matter of direct experience that the development of man from childhood onwards was connected with a diminution of certain original capacities of the soul. Yet he was so far a child of his age as to be no longer capable of seeing when ce these capacities originated. To provide the necessary corrective to Augus tine's doctrine of inheritance, Pelagius would have had to be able to see in the first years of life bot h a beginning of the earthly and a termination of the pre-earthly existence of the soul. The imperfections of his picture of man, however, led hi m to underestimate, even to deny, the significance of heredity and so of original sin in human life. For an age which no longer had any direct experi ence of the soul's pre-nata l life, the doctrines of Augustine were undoubtedly more appropriate than those of Pelagius; Augustine was in fact the more modern of the two. And now, if we move forward a dozen cen turies and compare Thomas Reid and Immanuel Kant from this same point of vi ew, we find the same conception of man again triumphant. But there is an essentia l difference: Kant carried all before him because he based himself on an age-old view of human nature, whereas Reid, uncomprehended up to our own day, pointed to a picture of man only just then dawning on the horizon of the future. Ju st as through Pelagius there sounded something like a last call to European human ity not to forget the cosmic nature of the soul, so through Reid the memory of this nature announced its first faint renewal. It is common to both that their voices lacked the clarity to make themselves heard among the other voices of their times; and with both the reason was the same: neither could perceive in fullness - the one no longer, th e other not yet - the picture of man which ensouled their ideas. The certainty of Reid's philosophical instinct , if such an expressi on be allowed, and at the same time his tragic limitations, due to an inability fully to understand the origin of this instinct, come out cl early in the battle he waged against the 'idea' as his immediate predecessors underst ood it. We know that Plato in troduced this word into"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 the philosophical language of mankind. In Greek ___ (from ___ , to see) means something of which one knows that it exists, because one sees it. It was therefore possible to use the word 'to see' as Pl ato did, because in his day it covered both sensible and supersensible perception. Fo r Plato, knowing consisted in the soul's raising itself to perceiving the objecti ve, world-forming IDEAS, and this action comprised at the same time a recollection of what the soul had seen while it lived, as an Idea among Ideas, before its appearance on earth. As long as Plato's philosophy continued to shape their thought, men went on speaking more or less traditionally of Ideas as real supersensible beings. When, however, the Aristotelian mode of thinking superseded th e Platonic, the term 'Idea' ceased to be used in its original sense; so much so that, when Locke and other modern philosophers resorted to it in order to desc ribe the content of the mind, they did so in complete obliviousness of its first significance. It is thus that in modern philosophy, and fina lly in ordinary modern usage, 'idea' came to be a word with many meanings. So metimes it signifies a sense-impression, sometimes a mental representation, some times the thought, concept or essential nature of a thing. The only thing common to these various meanings is an underlying implication that an idea is a purely subjective item in human consciousness, without any assured correspondence to anything outside. It was against this view of the idea that Reid took the field, going so far as to label the philosophy holding it the 'ideal system'. He fa iled to see, however, that in attacking the abstract use of the term he was actually in a position to restor e to it its original, genuine meaning. If, instead of simply throwing the word overboard, he had been able to make use of it in its real meani ng, he would have expressed himself with far greater exactitude and consistency. 5 He was prevented from doing this by his apparent ignorance of the earlier Greek philo sophers, Plato included. All he seems to have known of their teachings came from inferior, second-hand reports of a later and already decadent period. * * * There are two historic personalities, both in England, who witness to the fact that the emergence of Reid's philosophy on the stage of history was by no means an accidental event but that it represents a sy mptom of a general reappearance of the long-forgotten picture of man, in which birth no more than death sets up an absolute limit to human existence. They are Thomas Traherne (1638-74) and William Wordsworth (1770-1850). Wordsworth's work and character are so well known that there is no need to speak of them here in detail. 6 For our purpose we shall pay special attention only to his Ode on Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood, where he shows himself in possession of a memory (at any ra te at the time when he wrote the poem)"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 of the pre-natal origin of the soul, and of a capacity for experiencing, at certain moments, the frontier which the soul crosses at birth. If, despite the widespread familiarity of the Ode, we here quote certain passages from it, we do so because, like many similar things, it has fallen a victim to the intellectualism of our time in being regarded merely as a piece of poetic fantasy. We shall take the poet's words as literally as he himself uttered them. We read: 'Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting: The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star, Hath had elsewhere its setting, And cometh from afar: Not in entire forgetfulness, And not in utter nakedness, But trailing clouds of glory do we come From God who is our home: Heaven lies about us in our infancy! Shades of the prison house begin to close Upon the growing Boy. But he beholds the light, and whence it flows, He sees it in his joy; The Youth, who daily farther from the east Must travel, still is Nature's Priest, And by the vision splendid Is on his way attended.\" And later: 'Hence in a season of calm weather Though inland far we be, Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea Which brought us hither, Can in a moment travel thither, And see the Children sport upon the shore, And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.'' The fact that Wordsworth in his later years gave no further indication of such experiences need not prevent us from taki ng quite literally what he says here. The truth is that an original faculty faded away with increasing age, somewhat as happened with Reid when he could no l onger continue his philosophical work along its original lines. Wordsworth's Ode is the testament of the childhood forces still persisting but already declining within him; it is significant that he set it down in about the same year of life (h is thirty-sixth) as that in which Traherne died and in which Goethe, seeking renewal of his being, took flight to Italy. 7 "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 * Of Traherne, too, we shall say here only as much as our present consideration and the further aims of this book require. We cannot concern ourselves w ith the remarkable events which led, half a centu ry ago, to the discovery a nd identification of his long- lost writings by Bertram Dobell. Nor can we deal with the details of the eventful life and remarkable spiritual development of th is contemporary of the Civil War. These matters are dealt with in Dobell's introducti on to his edition of Traherne's poems, as also by Gladys I. Wade in her work, Thomas Traherne. Our gratitude for the labours of these two writers by which they have provided mankind with the knowledge of the character and the work of this unique personality cannot hinder us, however, from stating that both were prevented by the premis es of their own view of the world from rightly estimating that side of Traherne which is importa nt for us in this book, and with which we shall specially concer n ourselves in the following pages. Later in this chapter we shall discuss Dobell's philosophical misinterpretation of Traherne, to which he fell victim because he maintained his accustomed spectator standpoint in regard to his object of study. Miss Wade has, indeed, been able to pay the right tribute to Traherne, the mystic , whose inner (and also outer) biography she was able to detect by taking seriously Trah erne's indications c oncerning his mystical development. Her mind, however, was too rigi dly focused on this side of Traherne's life - his self-training by an iron inner di scipline and his toilsome ascent from the experience of Nothingness to a state of Bea tific Vision. This fact, combined with her disinclination to overcome the Augustinian pi cture of man in herself, prevented her from taking Traherne equally seriously wher e he speaks as one who is endowed with a never interrupted memory of his primev al cosmic consciousness - notwithstanding the fact that Traherne himself has pointed to this side of his nature as the most significant for his fellow-men. Of the two works of Traherne which Dobe ll rescued from oblivion, on both of which we shall draw for our exposition, one contains his poems, the other his prose writings. The title of the latter is Centuries of Meditations. The title page of one of the two manuscripts containing the collection of th e poetical writings introduces these as Poems of Felicity, Containing Divine Reflec tions on the Native Objects of an Infant- Eye. As regards the title 'Centuries of Me ditations' we are ignorant of the meaning Traherne may have attached to it, and what he meant by calling the four parts of the book, 'First', 'Second', etc., Century. The book itself represents a manual of devotion for meditative study by the reader. Let our first quotation be one from the ope ning paragraph of the third 'Century' in which Traherne introduces himself as the bearer of certain uncommon powers of memory and, arising from these powers, a particular mission as a teacher: 'Those pure and virgin apprehensions I had from the womb, and that divine light wherewith I was born are the best unto this day, wherein I can see the Universe. By the gift of God they attended me into th e world, and by His special favour I remember"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 83 them till now. Verily they seem the greatest gifts His wisdom could bestow, for without them all other gifts had been d ead and vain. They are unattainable by books, and therefore I will teach them by experience.' (Ill, 1.) The picture thus remaining with him of his na ture of soul in his earliest years on earth he describes as follows: 'Certainly Adam in Paradise had not more sweet and curious apprehensions of the world, than I when I was a child. All appeared new, and strange at first, inexpressibly rare and delightful and beautiful . I was a little stranger, which at my entrance into the world was saluted and surrounded with innum erable joys. My knowledge was Divine. I knew by intuition those things which sin ce my Apostacy, I collected again by the highest reason. I was entertained like an Angel with the work s of God in their splendour and glory, I saw all in the peace of Eden; Heaven and Earth did sing my Creator's praises, and could not make more melody to Adam, than to me. All Time was Eternity, and a perpetual Sabbath. Is it not strange, that an infant should be the heir of the whole world, and see those myst eries which the books of the learned never unfold?' (Ill, 1, 2.) In a different form the same experience comes to expression in the opening lines of Traherne's poem, Wonder: 'How like an Angel came I down! How bright are all things here I When first among his Works I did appear O how their GLORY did me crown! The World resembled his ETERNITIE, In which my Soul did Walk; And evry Thing that I did see Did with me talk .' 8 The picture of man thus sketched by Traherne is as close to Reid's as it is remote from Augustine's. This remoteness comes plainly to expression in the way Traherne and Augustine regard the summons of Christ to His disciples to become as little children, a summons to which Reid was led, as we have seen, on purely philosophical grounds. Let us first of all recall the words of Chri st as recorded by Matthew in his 18th and 19th chapters: 'And Jesus called a little child unto him, a nd set him in the midst of them, and said: Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of Heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven.' (xviii, 2-4.) 'Suffer the little children and forbid them not to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of Heaven.' (xix, 14.)"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84 Augustine refers to these words when he concludes that examination of his childhood memories which he undertook in order to prove the depravity of the soul from its first day on earth. He says: 'In the littleness of children didst Thou, our king, give us a symbol of humility when Thou didst say: Of such is the kingdom of Heaven.' If we glance back from what Augustine sa ys here to the original passages in the Gospel just quoted, we see what a remark able alteration he makes. Of the first passage only the last sentence is taken, and this in Augustine's mind is fused into one with the second passage. Thereby the admonition of Christ through one's own effort to become as one once was as a child disappear s completely. The whole passage thus takes on a meaning corresponding to that passive attitude to the divi ne will inculcated by Augustine and opposed by Pelagius, and it is in this sense that the words of Christ have sunk into the consciousness of Wester n Christianity and are usually taken to- day. We may see how differently this injunction of Christ lived in Traherne's consciousness from the following passage out of his Centuries: 'Our Saviour's meaning, when He said, ye must be born again and become a little child that will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, is deeper far than is generally believed. It is not only in a careless reliance upon Divine Pr ovidence, that we are to become little children, or in the feebleness and shortness of our anger and simplicity of our passions, but in the peace and purity of all our soul. Which purity also is a deeper thing than is comm only apprehended.' (Ill, 5.) With Traherne also the passage in questi on has been fused together with another utterance of Christ, from John's account of Christ's conversation with Nicodemus: 'Verily, verily I say unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.' (John iii, 3.) What conception of the infant condition of ma n must have existed in a soul for it to unite these two passages from the Gospels in this way? Whereas for Augustine it is because of its small stature and helplessne ss that the child becomes a symbol for the spiritual smallness and helplessness of man as such, compared with the overwhelming power of the divine King, for Traherne it is the child's nearness to God which is most present to him, and which must be re gained by the man who strives for inner perfection. Traherne could bear in himself such a pict ure of man's infancy because, as he himself emphasizes, he was in possession of an unbr oken memory of the experiences which the soul enjoys before it awakens to earth ly sense-perception. The following passage from the poem, My Spirit, gives a detailed picture of the early state in which the soul has experiences and perceptions quite different from those of its later life. (We may recall Reid's indication of how the child receives the natural language of things.)"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 'An Object, if it were before Mine Ey, was by Dame Nature's Law Within my Soul: Her Store Was all at once within me; all her Treasures Were my immediat and internal Pleasures; Substantial Joys, which did inform my Mind. '... I could not tell Whether the Things did there Themselvs appear, Which in my Spirit truly seem'd to dwell: Or whether my conforming Mind Were not ev'n all that therein shin'd.' Further detail is added to this pictur e by the description, given in the poem The Praeparative, of the soul's non-experience of the body at that early stage. The description is unmistakably one of an expe rience during the time between conception and birth. 'My Body being dead, my Limbs unknown; Before I skill'd to prize Those living Stars, mine Eys; Before or Tongue or Cheeks I call'd mine own, Before I knew these Hands were mine, Or that my Sinews did my Members join; When neither Nostril, Foot, nor Ear, As yet could be discerned or did appear; I was within A House I knew not; newly cloath'd with Skin. Then was my Soul my only All to me, A living endless Ey, Scarce bounded with the Sky, Whose Power, and Act, and Essence was to see; I was an inward Sphere of Light, Or an interminable Orb of Sight, Exceeding that which makes the Days, A vital Sun that shed abroad its Rays: All Life, all Sense, A naked, simple, pure Intelligence.'' In the stanza following upon this, Traherne makes a statement which is of particular importance in the context of our present di scussion. After some additional description of the absence of all bodily needs he says:"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86 ' Without disturbance then I did receiv The tru Ideas of all Things' The manuscript of this poem shows a small alteration in Traherne's hand in the second of these two lines. Where we now read 'true Ideas', there originally stood 'fair Ideas'. 'Fair' described Traherne's experi ence as he immediately remembered it; the later alteration to 'true' shows how well aw are he was that his contemporaries might miss what he meant by 'Idea', through taking it in the sense that had already become customary in his time, namely, as a me re product of man's own mental activity. This precaution, however, has not saved Trah erne from being misinterpreted in our own day in precisely the way he feared - indeed, by no less a person than his own discoverer, Dobell. It is the symptomatic character of this misinterpretation which prompts us to deal with it here. * In his attempt to classify the philoso phical mode of thought behind Traherne's writings, Dobell, to his own amazement, come s to the conclusion that Traherne had anticipated Bishop Berkeley (1684-1753). They seemed to him so alike that he does not hesitate to call Traherne a 'Berkeleyan be fore Berkeley was born'. In proof of this he refers to the poems, The Praeparative and My Spirit, citing from the latter the passage given above (page 112), and drawing special attention to its two concluding lines. Regarding this he says: 'I am much mistaken if the theory of non-existence of independent matter, which is the essence of Berkeley's system, is not to be found in this poem. The thought that the whole exteri or universe is not really a thing apart from and independent of man's consciousness of it, but something which exists only as it is perceived, is undeniably found in My Spirit: The reader who has followed our exposition in the earlier parts of th is chapter can be in no doubt that, to find a philosophy similar to Traherne's, he must look for it in Reid and not in Berkeley. Reid himself rightly placed Berkeley amongst the representatives of the 'ideal system' of thought. For Berkeley 's philosophy represents an effort of the onlooker-consciousness, unable as it was to ar rive at certainty regarding the objective existence of a material world outside itself, to secure recognition for an objective Self behind the flux of mental phenomena. Berk eley hoped to do this by supposing that the world, including God, consists of nothi ng but 'idea'-creating minds, operating like the human mind as man himself perceives it. His world picture, based (as is well known) entirely on optical experiences, is the perfect example of a philosophy contrived by the one-eyed, co lourblind world-spectator. We shall understand what in Traherne's de scriptions reminded Dobell of Berkeley, if we take into account the connexion of the soul with the body at the time when, according to Traherne, it still enjoys the untroubled perception of the true, the light- filled, Ideas of things."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87 In this condition the soul has only a di m and undifferentiated awareness of its connexion with a spatially limited body ('I was within a house I knew not, newly clothed with skin') and it certainly knows nothing at all of the body as an instrument, through which the will can be exercised in an earthly-spatial way ('My body being dead, my limbs unknown'). Instead of this, the soul experiences itself simply as a supersensible sense-organ and as such unite d with the far spaces of the universe ('Before I skilled to prize those living star s, mine eyes. ... Then was my soul my only All to me, a living endless eye, scarce bounded with the sky'). At the time when the soul has experiences of the kind described by Traherne, it is in a condition in which, as yet, no active contact has been established between itself and the physical matter of the body and thereby w ith gravity. Hence there is truth in the picture which Traherne thus sketches from actual memory. The same cannot be said of Berkeley's world-picture. The fact that both resemble each other in certain features need not surprise us, seeing that Berkeley 's picture is, in its own way, a pure 'eye- picture' of the world. As such, however, it is an illusion - for it is intended for a state of man for which it is not suited, namely for adult man going upright on the earth, directing his deeds within its material re alm, and in this way fashioning his own destiny. Indeed, compared with Berkeley's eye-pictur e of the world, that of Reid is in every respect a 'limb-picture'. For where he seek s for the origin of our naÃ ̄ve assurance that a real material world exists, there he reverts - guided by his common sense - to the experiences available to the soul through the fact that the limbs of the body meet with the resistant matter of the world. And wh enever he turns to th e various senses in his search, it is always the will-activity of th e soul within the sense he is investigating - and so the limb-nature with in it - to which he first turns his attention. Because, unlike Berkeley, he takes into account the experiences undergone by the soul when it leaves behind its primal condition, Reid does not fall into illu sion, but discovers a fundamental truth concerning the nature of the world-picture experienced by man in his adult age. This, in turn, enables him to discover the nature of man's world picture in early childhood and to recognize the importan ce of recovering it in later life as a foundation for a true philosophy. Assuredly, the philosopher who discovered th at we must become as little children again if we would be philosophers, is the one to whom we may relate Traherne, but not Berkeley. And if we wish to speak of Traherne, as Dobell tried to do, we speak correctly only if we call him a 'Reidean before Reid was born'. * * * A little more than a hundred years after Thom as Traherne taught his fellow-men 'from experience' that there is an original conditi on of man's soul, before it is yet able to prize 'those living stars, mine eyes', in whic h it is endowed with the faculty to see 'the true (fair) Ideas of a ll things', Goethe was led to the realization that he had achieved"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88 the possibility of 'seeing Ideas with the very eyes'. Although he was himself not aware of it, the conception of the Idea was at this moment restored th rough him to its true and original Platonic significance. The present chapter has show n us how this conception of the Idea is bound up with the view that is held of the relationshi p between human nature in early childhood and human nature in later life. We have seen th at, when Plato introduced the term Idea as an expression for spiritual entities having a real and independent existence, men were still in possession of some recollection of their own pre-earthly existence. We then found Traherne saying from his recollections that in the origin al form of man's consciousness his soul is endowed with the faculty of seeing 'true' Ideas, and we found Reid on similar grounds fighting the si gnificance which the term 'idea' had assumed under his predecessors. By their side we see Goethe as one in whom the faculty of seeing Ideas appears for the fi rst time in adult man as a result of a systematic training of observation and thought. If our view of the interdep endence of the Platonic conception of the Idea with the picture man has of himself is seen rightly, th en Goethe must have been the bearer of such a picture. Our expectation is shown to be right by the following two passages from Goethe's autobiography, Truth and Fiction. In that part of his life story where Goethe concludes the report of the first period of his childhood (Book II), he writes: 'Who is able to speak worthily of the fullness of childhood? We cannot behold the little creatures which flit about before us otherwise than with delight, nay, with admiration; for they generally promise more than they perform and it seems that nature, among the other roguish tricks that she plays us, he re also especially designs to make sport of us. The first organs she bestows upon child ren coming into the world, are adapted to the nearest imme diate condition of the creature, which, unassuming and artless, makes use of them in the readiest way for its present purposes. The child, considered in and for its elf, with its equals, and in relations suited to its powers, seems so intelligent and rational, and at the same time so easy, cheerful and clever, that one can hardly wish it further cultivation. If children grew up according to early indications, we should have nothing but geniuses.' 9 We find further evidence in Goethe's account of an event in his seventh year, which shows how deeply his soul was filled at that time with the knowledge of its kinship with the realm from which nature herself receives its existence. This knowledge led him to approach the 'great God of Natu re' through an act of ritual conceived by himself. The boy took a four-sectioned musi c stand and arranged on it all kinds of natural specimens, minerals and the like, until the whole formed a kind of pyramidal altar. On the top of this pyramid he pl aced some fumigating candles, the burning of which was to represent the 'upward yearning of the soul for its God'. In order to give nature herself an active part in the ritu al, he contrived to kindle the candles by focusing upon them through a magnifying-glass th e light of the rising sun. Before this"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 symbol of the unity of the soul with the divine in na ture the boy then paid his devotions. 'Unity of the soul with the divine in na ture' - this was what lived vividly as a conviction in the seven-year-old boy, impelling him to act as 'nature's priest' (Wordsworth). The same impulse, in a meta morphosed form, impelled the adult to go out in quest of an understanding of nature whic h, as Traherne put it, was to bring back through highest reason what once had b een his by way of primeval intuition. 1 The present writer's interest in Reid was first aroused by a remark of Rudolf Steiner, in his book A Theory of 'Knowledge according to Goethe's World Conception. 2 In a comment on a letter Carlyle had written to him, and in a note dealing with the contemporary philosophy in Germany. 3 This observation of Reid's shows that the orig in of language is very different from what the evolutionists since Darwin have imagined it to be. 4 Confessions, Book I , Chapter 8. 5 As we have seen, the word had better luck with Goethe. 6 Wordsworth, with all his limitations, had a real af finity with Goethe in his view of nature. Mr. Norman Lacey gives some indicati on of this in his recent book, Wordsworth's View of Nature. 7 This same period of life played a decisive part in the spiritual evolution of Rudolf Steiner, as may be seen in his autobiography, The Story of My Life. 8 The difference in spelling between the prose and poet ry excerpts arises from the fact that whereas we can draw on Miss Wade's new edition of the poems fo r Traherne's original spelling, we have as yet only Dobell's edition of the Centuries, in which the spelling is modernized. 9 Oxenford's translation."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 90 CHAPTER VII 'Always Stand by Form' Immediacy of approach to certa in essentials of nature as a result of their religious or artistic experience of th e sense-world, is the char acteristic of two more representatives of British cu ltural life. They are Luke Howard (1772-1864) and John Ruskin (1819-1900), both true readers in the book of nature. Like those discussed in the previous chapter they can be of especial help to us in our attempt to establish an up-to-date method of apprehendi ng nature's phenomena through reading them. At the same time we shall find ourselves led in to another sphere of Goethe's scientific work. For we cannot properly discuss Howa rd without recognizi ng the importance of his findings for Goethe's mete orological studies or wit hout referring to the personal connexion between the two men arising out of their common inte rest and similar approach to nature. We shall thus come as a matter of course to speak of Goethe's thoughts about meteorology, and this again will give opportunity to introduce a leading concept of Goethean science in addition to those brought forward already. Of Ruskin only so much will appear in th e present chapter as is necessary to show him as an exemplary reader in the book of nature. He will then be a more or less permanent companion in our investigations. The following words of Ruskin from The Queen of the Air reveal him at once as a true reader in the book of nature: 'Over the entire surface of the earth and its waters, as influenced by the power of the air under solar light, there is developed a se ries of changing forms, in clouds, plants and animals, all of which have reference in their action, or nature, to the human intelligence that perceives them.' (II, 89.) Here Ruskin in an entirely Goethean way points to form in nature as the element in her that speaks to human intelligence - meaning by form, as other utterances of his show, all those qualities through which th e natural object under observation reveals itself to our senses as a whole. By virtue of his pictorial- dynamic way of regarding nature, Ruskin was quite clear that the scientists' one-sided seeking afte r external forces and the mathematically calculable interplay between them can never l ead to a comprehension of life in nature. For in such a search man loses sight of the real signature of life: form as a dynamic element. Accordingly, in his Ethics of the Dust, Ruskin does not answer the question: 'What is Life?' with a scientific explana tion, but with the laconi c injunction: 'Always stand by Form against Force.' This he later enlarges pictorially in the words: 'Discern"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 the moulding hand of the potter commanding the clay from the merely beating foot as it turns the wheel.' (Lect. X.) In thus opposing form and force to each ot her, Ruskin is actually referring to two kinds of forces. There exist those forces wh ich resemble the potter's foot in producing mere numerically regulated movements (so that this part of the po tter's activity can be replaced by a power-machine), and others, which like the potter's hand, strive for a certain end and so in the process create defi nite forms. Ruskin goes a step further still in The Queen of the Air, where he speaks of selective or der as a mark of the spirit: 'It does not merely crystallize indefinite masses, but it gives to limited portions of matter the power of gathering, selectively, other elements proper to them, and binding these elements into their own peculiar and adopted form. ... 'For the mere force of junction is not spirit , but the power that catches out of chaos, charcoal, water, lime and what not, and fa stens them into given form, is properly called \"spirit\"; and we shall not diminish, but strengthen our cognition of this creative energy by recognizing its presence in lower states of matter than our own.' (II, 59.) 1 When Ruskin wrote this passage, he coul d count on a certain measure of agreement from his contemporaries that the essence of man himself is spirit, though certainly without any very exact notion being implied. Th is persuaded him to fight on behalf of the spirit, lest its activity on the lower levels of nature should not be duly acknowledged. To-day, when the purely physical conception of nature has laid hold of the entire man, Ruskin might have give n his thought the following turn: '... and we shall certainly attain to no r eal insight into this creative fo rce (of the spirit) at the level of man, unless we win the capac ity to recognize its activity in lower states of matter.' What Ruskin is really pointing towards is the very thing for which Goethe formed the concept 'type'. And just as Ruskin, like Go ethe, recognized the si gnature of the spirit in the material processes which work toward s a goal, so he counted as another such signature what Goethe called Steigerung, though certainly without forming such a universally valid idea of it: 'The Spirit in the plant - that is to say, its power of gathering dead matter out of the wreck round it, and shaping it in to its own chosen shape - is of course strongest in the moment of flowering, for it then not only gathers, but forms, with the greatest energy.' It is characteristic of Ruskin's conception of the relationship between man's mind and nature that he added: 'And where th is life is in it at full power, its form becomes invested with aspects that are chie fly delightful to our own senses.' (II, 60.) Obviously, a mind capable of looking at natu re in this way could not accept such a picture of evolution as was put forward by Ruskin's contemporary, Darwin. So we find Ruskin, in The Queen of the Air, opposing the Darwinistic conception of the preservation of the species as the dr iving factor in the life of nature:"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 'With respect to plants as animals, we ar e wrong in speaking as if the object of life were only the bequeathing of itself. The fl ower is the end and proper object of the seeds, not the seed of the flower. The reas on for the seed is that flowers may be, not the reason of flowers that seeds may be. The flower itself is the creature which the spirit makes; only, in connection with its perfectedness, is placed the giving birth to its successor.' (II, 60.) For Ruskin the true meaning of life in all its stages lay not in the maintenance of physical continuity from generation to genera tion, but in the ever-renewed, ever more enhanced revelation of the spirit. He was never for a moment in doubt regard ing the inevitable effect of such an evolutionary theory as Darwin's on the ge neral social attitude of humanity. Men would be led, he realized, to see themselves as the accidental products of an animal nature based on the struggle for existence and the preservation of the species. Enough has been said to stamp Ruskin as a re ader in the book of nature, capable of deciphering the signature of the spirit in the phenomena of the sense-world. * Outwardly different from Ruskin's and yet spiritually comparable , is the contribution made by his older contemporary, Luke Howa rd, to the foundation of a science of nature based on intuition. Whereas Ruskin throws out a multitude of aphoristic utterances about many different aspects of nature, which w ill provide us with further starting-points for our own observation and thought, Howard is concerned with a single sphere of phenomena, that of cloud formation. On the other hand, his contribution consists of a definite disc overy which he himself methodically and consciously achieved, and it is the content of this discover y, together with the method of research leading to it, which will supply us ever and again with a model for our own procedure. At the same time, as we have indicated, he will help us to become familiar with another side of Goethe, and to widen our knowledge of the basic scientific concepts formed by him. Anyone interested to-day in weather phenomena is acquainte d with the terms used in cloud classification - Cirrus, Cumulus, Stratu s, and Nimbus. These have come so far into general use that it is not easy to realize that, until Howard's paper, On the Modification of Clouds, appeared in 1803, no names fo r classifying clouds were available. Superficially, it may seem that Howard had done nothing more than science has so often done in grouping and classifyi ng and naming the contents of nature. In fact, however, he did something essentially different. In the introduction to his essay, Howard describes the motives which led him to devote himself to a study of meteorological phenomena: 'It is the frequent observation of the counten ance of the sky, and of its connexion with the present and ensuing phenomena, that constitutes the ancient and popular"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 meteorology. The want of this branch of knowledge renders the prediction of the philosopher (who in attending his instruments may be said to examine the pulse of the atmosphere), less generally successful than those of the weather-wise mariners and husbandmen.' When he thus speaks of studying 'the counten ance of the sky', Howard is not using a mere form of speech; he is exactly descri bing his own procedure, as he shows when he proceeds to justify it as a means to sc ientific knowledge. The clouds with their ever-moving, ever-changing forms are not, he sa ys, to be regarded as the mere 'sport of the winds', nor is their existence 'the mere result of the condensation of vapour in the masses of the atmosphere which they o ccupy'. What comes to view in them is identical, in its own realm, with what the changing expression of the human face reveals of 'a person's state of mind or body'. It would hardly be possible to represent oneself more clearly as a genuine reader in the book of nature than by such words. What is it but Ruskin's 'Stand by Form against Force' that Howard is here saying in his own way? * Before entering into a further description of Howard's system, we must make clear why we disregard the fact that modern me teorology has developed the scale of cloud- formation far beyond Howard, and why we sh all keep to his own fourfold scale. It is characteristic of Goethe that, on beco ming acquainted with Howard's work, he at once gave a warning against subdividing his scale without limit. Goethe foresaw that the attempt to insert too many transitory forms between Howard's chief types would result only in obscuring that view of th e essentials which Howard's original classification had opened up. Obviously, fo r a science based on mere onlooking there is no objection to breaking up an established system into ever more subdivisions in order to keep it in line with an increasi ngly detailed outer observation. This, indeed, modern meteorology has done with Howard's sy stem, with the result that, to-day, the total scale is made up of ten different stages of cloud-formation. Valuable as this tenfold scale may be for certain practical purposes, it must be ignored by one who realizes that through Ho ward's fourfold scale nature herself speaks to man's intuitive judgment. Let us, therefore, turn to Howard's discovery, undisturbed by the extension to which modern meteorology has subjected it. Luke Howard, a chemist by profession, knew well how to value the results of scientific knowledge above traditional folk-knowledge. He saw the superiority of scientifically acquired knowle dge in the fact that it wa s universally communicable, whereas folk-wisdom is bound up with the pe rsonality of its b earer, his individual observations and his memory of them. Neve rtheless, the increasing mathematizing of science, including his own branch of it, gave him great concern, for he could not regard it as helpful in the true progress of man's understanding of nature. Accordingly, he sought for a method of obs ervation in which the practice of 'the"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94 weatherwise mariner and husbandman' could be raised to the level of scientific procedure. To this end he studied the ch anging phenomena of the sky for many years, until he was able so to read its play of features that it disclosed to him the archetypal forms of cloud-formation underlying all change. To these he gave the now well- known names (in Latin, so that they might be internationally comprehensible): Cirrus: Parallel, flexuous or divergent fibres extensible in any and all directions. Cumulus: Convex or conical heaps, incr easing upwards from a horizontal base. Stratus: A widely extended, continuous, horizontal sheet, increasing from below. Nimbus: The rain cloud. Let us, on the background of Howard's brie f definitions, try to form a more exact picture of the atmospheric dynamics at work in each of the stages he describes. 2 Among the three formations of cirrus, cumulus and stratus, the cumulus has a special place as representing in the most actual sense what is meant by the term 'cloud'. The reason is that both cirrus and stratus have characteristics which in one or the other direction tend away from the pure real m of atmospheric cloud-formation. In the stratus, the atmospheric vapour is gathered into a horizontal, re latively arched layer around the earth, and so anticipates the act ual water covering below which extends spherically around the earth's centre. Thus the stratus arranges itself in a direction which is already conditioned by the earth' s field of gravity. In the language of physics, the stratus forms an equipotential surface in the gravitational field permeating the earth's atmosphere. As the exact opposite of this we have the ci rrus. If in the stratus the form ceases to consist of distinct particul ars, because the en tire cloud-mass runs together into a single layer, in the cirrus the form begi ns to vanish before our eyes, because it dissolves into the surrounding atmospheric space. In the cirrus there is present a tendency to expand; in th e stratus to contract. Between the two, the cumulus, even viewed simply as a form-type, represents an exact mean. In how densely mounded a shape does the majestically towering cumulus appear before us, and yet how buoyantly it hovers aloft in the heights! If one ever comes into the midst of a cumulus cloud in the mountains, one sees how its myriads of single particles are in ceaseless moveme nt. And yet the whole remains stationary, on windless days preserving its form unchanged for hours. More recent meteorological research has es tablished that in many cumulus forms the entire mass is in constant rotation, although seen from out side, it appears as a stable, unvarying shape. Nowhere in nature may the suprem acy of form over ma tter be so vividly observed as in the cumulus cloud. And the form s of the cumuli themselves tell us in manifold metamorphoses of a state of equi librium between expans ive and contractive tendencies within the atmosphere."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 Our description of the three cloud-types of cirrus, cumulus and stratus, makes it clear that we have to do with a self-contained sy mmetrical system of forms, within which the two outer, dynamically regarded, repres ent the extreme tendencies of expansion and contraction, whilst in the middle forms thes e are held more or less in balance. By adding Howard's nimbus formation to this system, we destroy its symmetry. Actually, in the nimbus we have cloud in such a condi tion that it ceases to be an atmospheric phenomenon in any real sense of the word ; for it now breaks up in to single drops of water, each of which, under th e pull of gravity, makes its own independent way to the earth. (The symmetry is restor ed as soon as we realize th at the nimbus, as a frontier stage below the stratus, has a counterpart in a corresponding frontier stage above the cirrus. To provide insight into this upper frontier stage, of which neither Howard nor Goethe was at that time in a position to develop a clear enough conception to deal with it scientifically, is on e of the aims of this book.) * In order to understand what prompted Goethe to accept, as he did, Howard's classification and terminology at first gl ance, and what persuaded him to make himself its eloquent herald, we must note from what point Goethe's labours for a natural understanding of nature had originated. In his History of my Botanical Studies Goethe mentions, besides Shakespeare and Spinoza, Linnaeus as one who had most infl uenced his own development. Concerning Linnaeus, however, this is to be underst ood in a negative sense. For when Goethe, himself searching for a way of bringing the confusing multiplicity of plant phenomena into a comprehensive system, me t with the Linnaean system, he was, despite his admiration for the thoroughne ss and ingenuity of Linnaeus's work, repelled by his method. Thus by way of reac tion, his thought was brought into its own creative movement: 'As I sought to take in his acute, ingenious analysis, his apt, appropriate, though often arbitr ary laws, a cleft was set up in my inner nature: what he sought to hold forcibly apart could not but strive for union according to the inmost need of my own being.' Linnaeus's system agonized Goethe becau se it demanded from him 'to memorize a ready-made terminology, to hold in r eadiness a certain number of nouns and adjectives, so as to be able, whenever a ny form was in question, to employ them in apt and skilful selection, and so to gi ve it its characteris tic designation and appropriate position.' Such a procedure appear ed to Goethe as a kind of mosaic, in which one ready-made piece is set next to another in order to produce out of a thousand details the semblance of a picture; and this was 'in a certain way repugnant' to him. What Goethe awoke to when he met Linnaeus's attempt at systematizing the plant kingdom was the old problem of whether the study of nature should proceed from the parts to the whole or from the whole to the parts. Seeing, therefore, how it became a question for Goethe, at the very beginning of his scientific studies, whether a natural classification of nature's phenomena could be"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 96 achieved, we can understand why he was so overjoyed when, towards the end of his life, in a field of observation which had m eanwhile caught much of his interest, he met with a classification which showed, dow n to the single names employed, that it had been read off from reality. * The following is a comprehensive descrip tion of Goethe's meteorological views, which he gave a few years before his deat h in one of his conversations with his secretary, Eckermann: 'I compare the earth and her hygrosphere 3 to a great living being perpetually inhaling and exhaling. If she inhales, she draws th e hygrosphere to her, so that, coming near her surface, it is condensed to clouds and rain. This state I call water-affirmative (WasserBejahung). Should it continue for an indefi nite period, the earth would be drowned. This the earth does not allow, but exhales ag ain, and sends the watery vapours upwards, when they are dissipat ed through the whole space of the higher atmosphere. These become so rarefied that not only does the sun penetrate them with its brilliancy, but the eternal darkness of in finite space is seen through them as a fresh blue. This state of the atmo sphere I call water-negative ( WasserVerneinung). For just as, under the contrary influence, not only does water come profusely from above, but also the moisture of the ear th cannot be dried and dissipa ted - so, on the contrary, in this state not only does no moisture come fr om above, but the damp of the earth itself flies upwards; so that, if this should continue for an inde finite period, the earth, even if the sun did not shine, would be in danger of drying up.' (llth April 1827.) Goethe's notes of the results of his mete orological observations show how in them, too, he followed his principle of keeping st rictly to the phenomenon. His first concern is to bring the recorded measurements of weather phenomena into their proper order of significance. To this end he compares measurements of atmospheric temperature and local density with barometric measuremen ts. He finds that the first two, being of a more local and accidental nature, have the value of 'derived' phenomena, whereas the variations in the atmosphere revealed by the barometer are the same over wide areas and therefore point to fundamental changes in the general conditions of the earth. Measurements made re gularly over long periods of time finally lead him to recognize in the barometric variations of atmospheric pressure the basic meteorological phenomenon. In all this we find Goethe carefully gu arding himself against 'explaining' these atmospheric changes by assuming some kind of purely mechanical cause, such as the accumulation of air-masses over a certain area or the like. Just as little would he permit himself lightly to assume influences of an extra-terrestri al nature, such as those of the moon. Not that he would have had anything against such things, if they had rested on genuine observation. But his ow n observations, as far as he was able to carry them, told him simply that the at mosphere presses with greater or lesser intensity on the earth in more or less re gular rhythms. He was not abandoning the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 97 phenomenal sphere, however, when he said that these changes are results of the activity of earthly gravity, or when he concl uded from this that barometric variations were caused by variations in the intensity of the field of terrestrial gravity, whereby the earth sometimes drew the atmosphere to it with a stronger, and sometimes with a weaker, pull. He was again not departing from the realm of the phenomenal when he looked round for other indications in nature of such an al ternation of drawing in and letting forth of air, and found them in the respiratory pro cesses of animated beings. (To regard the earth as a merely physical structure was impossible for Goethe, for he could have done this only by leaving out of account the life vi sibly bound up with it.) Accordingly, barometric measurements became for him the sign of a breathing process carried out by the earth. Alongside the alternating phases of contrac tion and expansion within the atmosphere, Goethe placed the fact that atmospheric de nsity decreases with height. Observation of differences in cloud formation at different levels, of the boundary of snow formation, etc., led him to speak of different 'atmosphere s', or of atmospheric circles or spheres, which when undisturbed are arranged concen trically round the earth. Here also he saw, in space, phases of contraction alternating with phases of expansion. * At this point in our discussion it is nece ssary to introduce anothe r leading concept of Goethean nature-observation, which was for him - as it will be for us - of particular significance for carrying over th e Goethean method of resear ch from the organic into the inorganic realm of nature. This is the concept of the ur-phenomenon (UrphÃ¤nomen). In this latter realm, nature no longer brings forth related phenomena in the ordering proper to them; hence we are obliged to acquire the capacity of penetrating to this ordering by means of our own realistically tr ained observation and thought. From among the various utterances of Goet he regarding his general conception of the ur-phenomenon, we here select a passage from th at part of the historical section of his Theory of Colour where he discusses the method of investigation introduced into science by Bacon. He says: 'In the range of phenomena all had equal value in Bacon's eyes. For although he himself always points out that one should co llect the particulars only to select from them and to arrange them, in order finall y to attain to Universals, yet too much privilege is granted to the single facts; and before it be comes possible to attain to simplification and conclusion by means of induction (the very way he recommends), life vanishes and forces ge t exhausted. He who cannot re alize that one instance is often worth a thousand, bearing all within itself; he who proves unable to comprehend and esteem what we called ur-phenomena , will never be in a position to advance anything, either to his own or to others' joy and profit.'"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 98 What Goethe says here calls for the fo llowing comparison. We can say that nature seen through Bacon's eyes appears as if pa inted on a two-dimensional surface, so that all its facts are seen alongs ide each other at exactly the same distance from the observer. Goethe, on the other hand, ascribed to the human spirit the power of seeing the phenomenal world in all its three-dimens ional multiplicity; that is, of seeing it in perspective and distinguishing between foreground and background. 4 Things in the foreground he called ur-phenomena. Here the idea creatively determining the relevant field of facts comes to its purest expressi on. The sole task of the investigator of nature, he considered, was to seek for the ur-phenomena and to bring all other phenomena into relation with them; and in the fulfilment of this task he saw the means of fully satisfying the human mind's n eed to theorize. He expressed this in the words, 'Every fact is itself already theory'. In Goethe's meteorological studies we have a lucid example of how he sought and f ound the relevant ur-phenomenon. It is the breathing-process of the earth as shown by the variations of barometric pressure. * Once again we find Thomas Reid, along his line of intuitively guided observation, coming quite close to Goethe where he deal s with the question of the apprehension of natural law by the human mind. He, t oo, was an opponent of the method of 'explaining' phenomena by means of abstract theories spun out of sheer thinking, and more than once in his writings he invei ghs against it in his downright, humorous way. 5 His conviction that human thinking ought to remain within the realm of directly experienced observation is shown in the follo wing words: 'In the solution of natural phenomena, all the length that the human facu lties can carry us is only this, that from particular phenomena, we may, by inducti on, trace out general phenomena, of which all the particular ones ar e necessary consequences.' 6 As an example of this he takes gravity, leading the reader from one phenomen on to the next without ever abandoning them, and concluding the journey by sayi ng: 'The most general phenomena we can reach are what we call laws of nature. So th at the laws of nature are nothing else but the most general facts relating to the opera tions of nature, which include a great many particular facts under them.' * It was while on his way with the Grand D uke of Weimar to visit a newly erected meteorological observatory that Goethe, in the course of informing his companion of his own meteorological ideas, first heard of Howard's writings about the formation of clouds. The Duke had read a report of them in a German scientif ic periodical, and it seemed to him that Howard's cloud system corresponded with what he now heard of Goethe's thoughts about the fo rce relationships working in the different atmospheric levels. He had made no mistake. Goethe , who immediately obtai ned Howard's essay, recognized at first glance in Howard's cloud scale the law of atmospheric changes which he himself had discovered. He found here, what he had always missed in the"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 customary practice of merely tabulating the results of scientific measurements. And so he took hold of the Howard system with delight, for it 'provided him with a thread which had hitherto been lacking'. Moreover, in the names which Howard ha d chosen for designating the basic cloud forms, Goethe saw the dynamic element in each of them coming to immediate expression in human speech. 7 He therefore always spoke of Howard's system as a 'welcome terminology'. All this inspired Goethe to celebrate Howa rd's personality and his work in a number of verses in which he gave a descripti on of these dynamic elements and a paraphrase of the names, moulding them together into an artistic unity. In a few accompanying verses he honoured Howard as the first to 'distinguish and suitably name' the clouds. 8 The reason why Goethe laid so much stress on Howard's terminology was because he was very much aware of the power of names to help or hinder men in their quest for knowledge. He himself usually waited a l ong time before deciding on a name for a natural phenomenon or a connexion between phenomena which he had discovered. The Idea which his spiritual ey e had observed had first to appear so clearly before him that he could clothe it in a thought-form proper to it. Seeing in the act of name - giving an essential function of man (we ar e reminded of what in this respect the biblical story of creation says of Adam), 9 Goethe called man 'the first conversation which Nature conducts with God'. It is characteristic of Goet he that he did not content himself with knowing the truth which someone had brought forward in a fi eld of knowledge in which he himself was interested, but that he felt his acquaintance with this truth to be complete only when he also knew something about the personality of the man himself. So he introduces his account of his endeavour s to know more about Howard, the man, with the following words: 'Increasingly convinced that everything occurring through man should be regarded in an ethical sense, a nd that moral value is to be estimated only from a man's way of life, I asked a friend in London to find out if possible something about Howard's life, if only the simplest facts.' Goethe was uncertain whether the Englishman was still alive, so his delight and surprise we re considerable when from Howard himself he received an answer in th e form of a short autobiographical sketch, which fully confirmed his expectations regarding Howard's ethical personality. Howard's account of himself is known to us, as Goethe included a translation of it in the collection of his own mete orological studies. Howard in a modest yet dignified way describes his Christian faith, his guide through all his relationships, whether to other men or to nature. 10 A man comes before us w ho, untroubled by the prevailing philosophy of his day, was able to advance to the knowledge of an objective truth in nature, because he had the ability to ca rry religious experience even into his observation of the sense-world. *"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 100 In view of all this, it is perhaps not too much to say that in the meeting between Howard and Goethe by way of the spiritual bridge of the clouds, something happened that was more than a mere event in the personal history of these two men. 1 These words should be weighed with the fact in mind that they were written at the time when Crookes was intent on finding the unknown land of the spirit by means of just such 'a mere force of junction'. 2 See also Goethe's sketch of th e basic cloud forms on Plate IV. 3 Goethe's Dunstkreis - meaning the humidity contained in the air and, as such, spherically surrounding the earth. I had to make up the word 'h ygrosphere' (after hygromet er, etc.) to keep clear the distinction from both atmosphere and hydrosphere. Except for this term in the first two sentences, the above follows Oxenford's translation (who, following the dictionaries, has rendered Goethe's term inadequately by 'atmosphere'). 4 We may here recall Eddington's statement concerning the restriction of scientific observation to 'non- stereoscopic vision'. 5 An example of this is Reid's commentary on existing theories about sight as a mere activity of the optic nerve. ( Inq ., VI, 19.) 6 See Inq., VI, 13. This is precisely what Kant had declared to be outside human possibility. 7 Stratus means layer, cumulus - heap, cirrus - curl. 8 There exists no adequate translation of these verses. 9 Genesis ii, 19, 20. 10 A fact which Howard did not mention, and which presumably remained unknown to Goethe, was the work he had done as chairman of a relief co mmittee for the parts of Ge rmany devastated by the Napoleonic wars. For this work Howard received a series of public honours. "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 101 CHAPTER VIII Dynamics versus Kinetics At the present time the human mind is in danger of confusing the realm of dynamic events, into which modern atomic research has penetrated, with the world of the spirit; that is, the world wh ence nature is endowed with intelligent design, and of which human thinking is an expression in term s of consciousness. If a view of nature as a manifestation of spirit, such as Goethe and kindred minds conceived it, is to be of any significance in our time, it must incl ude a conception of matter which shows as one of its attributes its capacity to serve Form (in the sense in which Ruskin spoke of it in opposition to mere Force) as a means of manifestation. The present part of this book, comprisi ng Chapters VIII-XI, will be devoted to working out such a conception of matter. An example will thereby be given of how Goethe's method of acquiring understandi ng of natural phenomena through reading the phenomena themselves may be carried beyond his own field of observation. There are, however, certain theoretical obst acles, erected by the onlooker-consciousness, which require to be removed before we can actually set foot on the new path. The present chapter will in particular serve this purpose. * Science, since Galileo, has been rooted in the conviction that the logic of mathematics is a means of expressing the behaviour of natural events. The material for the mathematical treatment of sense data is obtained through measurement. The actual thing, therefore, in which the scientific obs erver is interested in each case, is the position of some kind of pointer. In fact, phys ical science is essentially, as Professor Eddington put it, a 'pointer-reading science'. Looking at this fact in our way we can say that all pointer instruments which ma n has constructed ever since the beginning of science, have as their model man himself, restricted to colour less, non-stereoscopic observation. For all that is left to him in this condition is to focus points in space and register changes of their positions. Indeed, the perfect scientific observer is himself the arch-pointer-instrument. The birth of the method of pointer-reading is marked by Galileo's construction of the first thermometer (actually, a thermoscope). The conviction of the applicability of mathematical concepts to the descripti on of natural events is grounded in his discovery of the so-called Parallelogram of Forces. It is with these two innovations that we shall concern ourselves in this chapter. Let it be said at once that our investigati ons will lead to the unveiling of certain illusions which the spectator-consciousne ss has woven round these two gifts of"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 102 Galileo. This does not mean that their signifi cance as fundamentals of science will be questioned. Nor will the practical uses to wh ich they have been put with so much success be criticized in any way. But ther e are certain deceptive ideas which became connected with them, and the result is that to-day, when man is in need of finding new epistemological ground under his feet, he is entangled in a network of conceptual illusions which prevent him from using his reason with the required freedom. A special word is necessary at this point re garding the term illusion, as it is used here and elsewhere. In respect of this, it will be well to remember what was pointed out earlier in connexion with the term 'tragedy' (Chapter II). In speaking of 'illusion', we neither intend to cast any blame on some person or another who took part in weaving the illusion, nor to suggest that the emer gence of it should be thought of as an avoidable calamity. Rather should illusion be thought of as something which man has been allowed to weave because only by hi s own active overcoming of it can he fulfil his destiny as the bearer of truth in free dom. Illusion, in the sense used here, belongs to those things in man's existence which are truly to be called tragic. It loses this quality, and assumes a quite different one , only when man, once the time has come for overcoming an illusion, insists on clinging to it. As our further studies will s how, the criticism to be appl ied here does not only leave the validity of measurement and the mathema tical treatment of th e data thus obtained fully intact, but by giving them their appropr iate place in a wider conception of nature it opens the way to an ever more firmly grounded and, at the same time, enhance application of both. * Our primary knowledge of the existence of so mething we call 'warmth' or 'heat' is due to a particular sense of warmth which m odern research has recognized as a clearly definable sense. Naturally, seen from the spectator-standpoint, the experiences of this sense appear to be of purel y subjective value and theref ore useless for obtaining an objective insight into the natu re of warmth and its effect s in the physical world. In order to learn about these, resort is ha d to certain instruments which, through the change of the spatial positi on of a point, allow the onl ooker-observer to register changes in the thermal condition of a physical object. An instrument of this kind is the thermometer. In the following way an i ndubitable proof seems to be given of the correctness of the view concerning the s ubjectivity of the im pressions obtained through the sense of warmth, and of the obj ectivity of thermometrical measurement. A description of it is frequently given in physical textbooks as an introduction to the chapter on Heat. To begin with, the well-known fact is cited that if one plunges one's hands first into two different bowls, one filled with hot wa ter and the other with cold, and then plunges them together into a bowl of tepid water, this will feel cold to the hand coming from the hot water and warm to the hand coming from the cold. Next, it is pointed out that two thermometers which are put through the same procedure will"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 103 register an equal degree of temperature for th e tepid water. In this way the student is given a lasting impression of the superiority of the 'objective' recording of the instrument over the 'subjective' character of the experiences mediated by his sense of warmth. Let us now test this procedure by carrying out the same experiment with the help of thermometrical instruments in their original form, that is, the form in which Galileo first applied them. By doing so we proceed in a truly Goethean manner, because we divest the experiment of all accessories which pr event the phenomenon from appearing in its primary form. To turn a modern thermometer into a ther moscope we need only remove the figures from its scale. If we make the experiment with two such thermoscopes we at once become aware of something which usually escapes us, our attention being fixed on the figures recorded by the two instrume nts. For we now notice that the two instruments, when transferred from the hot and cold water into the tepid water, behave quite differently. In one the colu mn will fall, in the other it will rise. It is important to note that by this trea tment of the two instruments we have not changed the way in which they usually i ndicate temperature. For thermometrical measurement is in actual fact never anythi ng else than a recording of the movement of the indicator from one level to anothe r. We choose merely to take a certain temperature level - that of melting ice or some thing else - as a fixe d point of reference and mark it once for all on the instrument. Because we find this mark clearly distinguished on our thermometers, and the scales numbered accordingly, we fail to notice what lies ideally behind this use of the same zero for every new operation we undertake. What the zero signifies becomes clear direct ly we start to work with thermometers not marked with scales. For in order to be us ed in this form as real thermometers, they must be exposed on each occasion first of al l to some zero level of temperature, say, that of melting ice. If we then take them into the region of temperature we want to measure, we shall discern the differe nce of levels thr ough the corresponding movement of the column. The final position of the column tells us nothing in itself. It is always the change from one level to another th at the thermometer registers - precisely as does the sense of warmth in our hands in the experiment just described. Hence we see that in the ordinary operati on with the thermometers, and when we use our hands in the prescribed manner, we ar e dealing with the zer o level in two quite different ways. While in the/two instruments the zero level is the same, in accordance with the whole idea of thermometric measur ement, we make a special arrangement so as to expose our hands to two different leve ls. So we need not be surprised if these two ways yield different results. If, after placing two thermometers without scales in hot and cold water, we were to assign to each its own zero in accordance with the respective height of its column, and then graduate them from this reference point, they would necessarily record different levels when exposed to the tepid water, in just"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 104 the same way as the hands do. Our two hands , moreover, will receive the same sense- impression from the tepid water, if we keep them in it long enough. Seen in this light, the original experiment , designed to show the subjective character of the impressions gained through the sense of warmth, reveals itself as a piece of self-deception by the onlooker-consciousness. The truth of the matter is that, in so far as there is any subjective element in the experience and measurement of heat, it does not lie on the side of our sense of warmth, but in our judgment of the significance of thermometrical readings. In fact, our test of the alleged proof of the absolute superiority of pointer-readings over the impressions gained by our senses gives us proof of the correctness of Go ethe's statement, quoted earlier, that the senses do not deceive, but the judgment deceives. Let it be repeated here that what we have found in this way does not lead to any depreciation of the method of pointer-reading. For the direct findings of the senses cannot be compared quantita tively. The point is that the idea of the absolute superiority of physical measurement as a means of scientific knowledge, in all circumstances, must be abandoned as false. * We now turn to Galileo's discovery known as the theorem of the Parallelogram of Forces. The illusion which has been woven r ound this theorem expresses itself in the way it is described as being connected id eally with another theorem, outwardly similar in character, known as the theore m of the Parallelogram of Movements (or Velocities), by stating that the former follows logically from the latter. This statement is to be found in every textbook on physics at the outset of the chapter on dynamics (kinetics), where it serves to establish th e right to treat the dynamic occurrences in nature in a purely kinematic fashion, true to the requirements of the onlooker- consciousness. 1 The following description will show that, directly we free ourselves from the onlooker-limitations of our consciousness in the way shown by Goethe - and, in respect of the presen t problem, in particular also by Reid - the ideal relationship between the two theorems is seen to be pr ecisely the opposite to the one expressed in the above statement. The reason why we take pains to show this at the present point of our discussion is that only through replacing the fallacious conception by the correct one, do we open the way for forming a concrete concept of Force and thereby for establishing a truly dynamic conception of nature. * Let us begin by describing briefly the conten t of the two theorems in question. In Fig. 1, a diagrammatical representation is given of the parallelogram of movements. It sets out to show that when a point moves with a certain velocity in the direction indicated"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 105 by the arrow a, so that in a certain time it pa sses from P to A, and when it simultaneously moves with a second velo city in the direc tion indicated by b, through which alone it would pass to B in the same time, its actual movement is indicated by c, the diagonal in the parallelogram formed by a and b. An example of the way in which this theorem is practically applie d is the well-known case of a rower who sets out from P in order to cross at right a ngles a river indicated by th e parallel lines. He has to overcome the velocity a of the water of the river fl owing to the right by steering obliquely left towards B in or der to arrive finally at C. It is essential to observe that the c ontent of this theore m does not need the confirmation of any outer experience for its discovery, or to esta blish its truth. Even though the recognition of the fact which it expresses may have first come to men through practical observation, yet the content of this theorem can be discovered and proved by purely logical means. In this re spect it resembles a ny purely geometrical statement such as, that the sum of the angles of a triangle is tw o right angles (180Â°). Even though this too may have first been learnt through outer observation, yet it remains true that for the discovery of th e fact expressed by it - valid for all plane triangles - no outer experience is neede d. In both cases we find ourselves in the domain of pure geometric conceptions (l ength and direction of straight lines, movement of a point along these), whose re ciprocal relationships are ordered by the laws of pure geometric logic. So in the theo rem of the Parallelogram of Velocities we have a strictly geometrical theorem, w hose content is in the narrowest sense kinematic. In fact, it is the basic theorem of kinematics. We now turn to the second theorem which sp eaks of an outwardly similar relationship between forces. As is we ll nown, this states that two forces of different magnitude and dire ction, when they apply at the same point, act together in the manner of a single fo rce whose magnitude and direction may be represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram whose si des express in extent and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 106 direction the first two forces. Thus in Fig. 2, R exercises upon P the same effect as F 1 and F 2 together. Expressed in another way, a force of this magnitude working in the reverse direction (R') will establish an equilibrium with the ot her two forces. In technical practice, as is well known, this theorem is used for count less calculations, in both statics and dynamics, and indeed more frequently not in the form given here but in the converse manner, when a single known force is resolved into two component forces. (Distribution of a pr essure along frameworks, of air pressure along moving surfaces, etc.) It will now be our task to examine the l ogical link which is believed to connect one theorem with the other. This link is f ound in the well-known definition of physical force as a product of 'mass' and ' acceleration' - in algebraic symbols F = ma. We will discuss the implications of this definition in more detail later on. Let us first see how it is used as a foundation for the above assertion. The conception of 'force' as the product of 'mass' and 'acceleration' is based on the fact - easily experienced by anyone who cycles along a level road - that it is not velocity itself which requires the exertion of force, but the change of velocity - that is, acceleration or retardation (' negative acceleration' in th e sense of mathematical physics); also that in the cas e of equal accelerations, the force depends upon the mass of the accelerated object. The more massive the object, the greater will be the force necessary for accelerating it. This mass, in turn, reveals itself in the resistance a particular object offers to any change of its state of mo tion. Where different accelerations and the same mass are considered, the factor m in the above formula remains constant, and force and acceleration are directly proportio nal to each other. Thus in the acceleration is discovered a m easure for the magnitude of the force which thereby acts. Now it is logically evident that the theore m of the parallelogram of velocities is equally valid for movements with constant or variable velociti es. Even though it is somewhat more difficult to perceive ment ally the movement of a point in two different directions with two differently accelerated motions, and to form an inner conception of the resulting movement, we are nevertheless still within a domain which may be fully embraced by thought. Thus accelerated movements and movements under constant velocity can be resolved and combined according to the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 107 law of the parallelogram of movements, a la w which is fully attainable by means of logical thought. With the help of the definition of force as the product of mass and acceleration it seems possible, indeed, to derive the pa rallelogram of for ces from that of accelerations in a purely logical manner. For it is necessary only to extend all sides of an a parallelogram by mean s of the same factor m in order to turn it into an F parallelogram. A single geom etrical figure on paper can represent both cases, since only the scale needs to be altered in orde r that the same geometrical length should represent at one time the magnitude a and on another occasion ma. It is in this way that present-day scientific thought keeps itself convinced that the parallelogram of forces follows with logical evidence from the parallelogram of accelerations, and that the discovery of the former is theref ore due to a purely mental process. Since the parallelogram of forces is th e prototype of each further mathematical representation of physical fo rce-relationships in nature , the conceptual link thus forged between it and the basic theorem of kinematics has led to the conviction that the fact that natural events can be expre ssed in terms of mathematics could be, and actually has been, discovered through pure logical reas oning, and thus by the brain- bound, day-waking consciousness 'of the worl d-spectator. Justification thereby seemed to be given for the building of a valid scientific world-picture, purely kinematic in character. * The line of consideration we shall now ha ve to enter upon for carrying out our own examination of what is believed to be the link between the two theorems may seem to the scientifically trained reader to be of an all too elementary kind compared with the complexities of thought in which he is used to engage in order to settle a scientific problem. It is therefore necessary to state here that anyone who wishes to help to overcome the tangle of modern theoretical science must not be shy in applying thoughts and observations of seemingly so si mple a nature as those used both here and on other occasions. Some readiness, in fact, is required to play where necessary the part of the child in Hans Andersen's fairy-story of The Emperor's New Clothes, where all the people are loud in praise of the magnificent robes of the Emperor, who is actually passing through the streets with no clothes on at all, and a single child's voice exclaims the truth that 'the Emperor has nothing on'. There will repeatedly be occasion to adopt the role of this ch ild in the course of our own studies. * In the scientific definition of force gi ven above force appears as the result of a multiplication of two other magnitudes. Now as is well known, it is essential for the operation of multiplication that of the two factors forming the product at least one should exhibit the properties of a pure number. For two pure numbers may be multiplied together - e.g. 2 and 4 - and a number of concrete things can be multiplied"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 108 by a pure number - e. g. 3 apples and the num ber 4 - but no sense can be attached to the multiplication of 3 apples by 4 apples, let alone by 4 pears! The result of multiplication is therefore always either itself a pure number, when both factors have this property; or when one of the two factors is of the nature of a concrete object, the result is of the same quality as the latter. An apple will always remain an apple after multiplication, and what distinguishes the fi nal product (apples) from the original factor (apples) is only a pure number. If we take seriously what this simple consideration tells us of the nature of multiplication, and if we do not allow ourselves to deviate from it for whatever purpose we make use of this algebraic operation, then the various concepts we connect with the basic measurements in physics undergo a considerable change of meaning. Let us test, in this respect, the well-known formula which, in the conceptual language of physics, connects 'distance' (s), 'time' ( t ), and 'velocity' (c). It is written c = s / t, or s = ct . In this formula, s has most definitely the meaning of a 'thing', for it represents measured spatial distance. Of the two factor s on the other side of the second equation, one must needs have the same quality as s: this is c. Thus for the other factor, t, there remains the property of a pure number. We ar e, therefore, under an illusion if we assume the factor c to represent anything of what velocity implies in outer cosmic reality. The truth is that c represents a spatial distance just as s does, with the difference only that it is a certain unit-distance. Just as little does real time enter into this formula - nor does it into any other fo rmula of mathematical physics. 'Time', in physics, is always a pure number without a ny cosmic quality. Indeed, how could it be otherwise for a purely kinematic world-observation? We now submit the formula F = ma to the same scrutiny. If we attach to the factor a on the right side of the equation a definite quality, namely an observable acceleration, the other factor in the product is permitte d to have only the properties of a pure number; F, therefore, can be only of the same nature as a and must itself be an acceleration. Were it otherw ise, then the equation F = ma could certainly not serve as a logical link between the Veloc ity and Force parallelograms. Our present investigation has done no more th an grant us an insight into the process of thought whereby the consciousness limite d to a purely kinematic experience has deprived the concept of force of any r eal content. Let us look at the equation F = ma as a means of splitting of the magnitude F into two components m and a. The equation then tells us that F is reduced to the nature of pure acceleration, for that which resides in the force as a factor not observable by ki nematic vision has been split away from it as the factor m. For this factor, however, as we have seen, nothing remains over but the property of a pure number."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 109 Let us note here that the fi rst thinker to concern himsel f with a comprehensive world- picture in which the non-existence of a real concept of force is taken in earnest- namely, Albert Einstein - was also the firs t to consider mass as a form of energy and even to predict correctly, as was proved later, the am ount of energy represented by the unit of mass, thereby encouraging deci sively the new branch of experimental research which has led to the freeing of the so-called atomic energy. Is it then possible that pure numbers can effect wh at took place above and within Nagasaki, Hiroshima, etc.? Here we are standing on ce again before one of the paradoxes of modern science which we have found to play so considerable a part in its development. To find an interpretation of the formula F = ma, which is free from illusion, we must turn our attention first of a ll to the concepts 'force' and 'mass' themselves. The fact that men have these two words in their la nguages shows that the concepts expressed by them must be based on some experience that has been man's long before he was capable of any scientific re flexion. Let us ask what kind of experience th is is and by what part of his be ing he gathers it. The answer is, as simple self-observation wi ll show, that we know of the existence of force through the fact that we ourselves must exert it in order to move our own body. Thus it is the resist ance of our body against any alteration of its state of motion, as a result of its being composed of inert matte r, which gives us the experience of force both as a possession of our own and as a property of the outer world. All other references to force, in places where it cannot be immediately experienced, arise by way of analogy based on the similarity of th e content of our observation to that which springs from the exertion of force in our own bodies. As we see, in this experience of force that of mass is at once implied. Still, we can strengthen the latter by experimenting with some outer physical object. Take a fairly heavy object in your hand, stretch out your arm lightly and move it slowly up and down, watching intently the sensat ion this operation rouses in you. 2 Evidently the experience of mass outside our selves, as with that of our own body, comes to us through the experience of the force which we ourselves must exert in order to overcome some resisting force occasioned by the mass. Already this simple observation - as such made by means of the sense of movement and therefore outside the frontiers of the onlooker-consciousne ss - tells us that mass is nothing but a particular manifestation of force. Seen in the light of this experience, the equation F = ma requires to be interpreted in a manner quite different from that to which scientific logic has submitted it. For if we have to ascribe to F and m the same quality, then the rule of multiplication allows us to ascribe to a nothing but the character of a pure nu mber. This implies that there is no such thing as acceleration as a self-contained entity, merely attached to mass in an external way."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 110 What we designate as acceleration, and me asure as such, is nothing else than a numerical factor comparing two different conditions of force within the physical- material world. Only when we give the three factors in our equation this meaning, does it express some concrete outer reality. At the same ti me it forbids the use of this equation for a logical derivation of the pa rallelogram of forces from that of pure velocities. * The same method which has enabled us to restore its true meaning to the formula connecting mass and force will serve to find the true source of man's knowledge of the parallelogram of forces. Accordin gly, our procedure will be as follows. We shall engage two other pe rsons, together with whom we shall try to discover by means of our respective experiences of force the law under which three forces applying at a common point may hold themselv es in equilibrium. Our first step will consist in grasping each other by the hand a nd in applying various efforts of our wills to draw one another in differe nt directions, seeing to it th at we do this in such a way that the three joined hands remain undistur bed at the same place. By this means we can get as far as to establish that, when two persons maintain a steady direction and strength of pull, the third must alter his applied force with every change in his own direction in order to hold the two others in equilibrium. He will find that in some instances he must increase his pull and in other instances decrease it. This, however, is all that can be learnt in this way. No possibility arises at this stage of our investigation of establishing any ex act quantitative compar ison. For the forces which we have brought forth (and this is vali d for forces in general, no matter of what kind they are) represent pure intensities, outwardly neither visible nor directly measurable. We can certainly tell whether we are intensifying or diminishing the application of our will, but a numerical comparison between different exertions of will is not possible. In order to make such a comparison, a furt her step is necessary. We must convey our effort to some pointer-instrument - for instance, a spiral spring which will respond to an exerted pressure or pull by a change in its spatial extensi on. (Principle of the spring balance.) In this way, by making use of a certain property of matter - elasticity - the purely intensive magnitudes of the fo rces which we exert become extensively visible and can be presented geometrica lly. We shall therefore continue our investigation with the aid of three spring balances, which we hook together at one end while exposing them to the three pulls at the other. To mark the results of our repeated pulls of varying intensities and directions, we draw on the floor on which we stand thr ee chalk lines outward from the point underneath the common point of the three instruments, each in the direction taken up"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 111 by one of the three persons. Along these li nes we mark the extensions corresponding to those of the springs of the instruments. By way of this procedure we shall arrive at a sequence of figures such as is shown in Fig. 3. This is all we can discover empirically re garding the mutual relationships of three forces engaging at a point. Let us now heed the fact that nothing in this group of figures reveals that in each one of these trios of lines there resides a defi nite and identical geometrical order; nor do they convey anything that would turn our thoughts to the parallel ogram of velocities with the effect of leading us to expect , by way of analogy, a similar order in these figures. And this result, we note, is quite independent of our particular way of procedure, whether we use, right from the start, a measuring instrument, or whether we proceed as described above. * Having in this way removed the fallacious idea that the parallel ogram of forces can, and therefore ever has been, conceived by way of logical derivation from the parallelogram of velocities, we must then ask ourselves what it was, if not any act of logical reason, that led Galileo to discover it. History relates that on making th e discovery he exclaimed: 'La natura Ã ̈ scritta in lingua matematica! ' ('Nature is recorded in the language of mathematics.') These words reveal his surprise when he realized the implication of his discovery. Still, intuitively he must have known that usi ng geometrical lengths to symbolize the measured magnitudes of forces would yiel d some valid result. Whence came this intuition, as well as the other which led him to recognize from the figures thus obtained that in a parallelogram made up of any two of the three lines, the remaining line came in as its diagonal? And, quite apart from the particular event of the discovery, how can we account for the very fact that nature - at le ast on a certain level of her existence - exhibits rules of action expressible in terms of logical principles immanent in the human mind? *"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 112 To find the answer to these questions we mu st revert to certain facts connected with man's psycho-physical make-up of which th e considerations of Chapter II have already made us aware. Let us, therefore, transpose ourselves once mo re into the condition of the child who is still entirely volition, and thus experiences himself as one with the world. Let us consider, from the point of view of this condition, the process of lifting the body into the vertical position and the acquisition of the faculty of maintaining it in this position; and let us ask what the soul, though with no consciousness of itself, experiences in all this. It is the child's will which wrestles in this act with the dynamic structure of external space, and what his will experiences is accompanied by corresponding perceptions through the sense of movement and other related bodily senses. In this way the parallelogram of forces becomes an inner experience of our organism at the beginning of our earthly life. What we thus carry in the body's will- region in the form of experienced geometry - this, together with the freeing and crystallizing of part of our will-substance into our conceptual capacity, is transformed into our faculty of forming geometrical c oncepts, and among them the concept of the parallelogram of movements. Looked at in this way, the tr ue relationship between the two parallelogram-theorems is seen to be the very opposite of the one held with conviction by scientific thinking up to now. Instead of the parallelogram of forces following from the parallelogram of movements, and the entire sc ience of dynamics from that of kinematics, our very faculty of thinking in kinematic concep ts is the evolutionary product of our previously acquired intuitive experien ce of the dynamic order of the world. If this is the truth concer ning the origin of our knowledge of force and its behaviour on the one hand, and our capacity to conceive mathematical concepts in a purely ideal way on the other, what is it then that cause s man to dwell in such illusion as regards the relationship between the two? From our account it follows that no illusion of this kind could arise if we were able to reme mber throughout life our experiences in early childhood. Now we know from our considerations in Chapter VI that in former times man had such a memory. In those times, ther efore, he was under no illusion as to the reality of force in the world. In the working of outer forces he saw a manifestation of spiritual beings, just as in himself he expe rienced force as a mani festation of his own spiritual being. We have seen also that th is form of memory had to fade away to enable man to find himself as a self-cons cious personality between birth and death. As such a personality, Galileo was able to think the parallelogram of forces, but he was unable to comprehend the origin of his f aculty of mathematical thinking, or of his intuitive knowledge of the mathematical beha viour of nature in that realm of hers where she sets physical forces into action. Deep below in Galileo's soul there lived, as it does in every human being, the intuitive knowledge, acquired in early childhood, that part of nature's order is recordable in the conceptual language of mathematics. In order that this in tuition should rise sufficiently far into his conscious mind to gui de him, as it did, in his observations, the"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 113 veil of oblivion which otherwise separa tes our waking consciousness from the experiences of earliest childhood must have been momentarily li ghtened. Unaware of all this, Galileo was duly surprised when in the onlooker-part of his being the truth of his intuition was confirmed in a way accessible to it, namely through outer experiment. Yet with the veil immediatel y darkening again the onlooker soon became subject to the illusion that for his recogniti on of mathematics as a means of describing nature he was in need of nothing but what was accessible to him on the near side of the veil. Thus it became man's fate in the first phase of science, which fills the period from Galileo and his contemporaries up to the pr esent time, that the very faculty which man needed for creating th is science prevented him from recognizing its true foundations. Restricted as he was to the bu ilding of a purely kine matic world-picture, he had to persuade himself that the order of interdependence of the two parallelogram-theorems wa s the opposite of the one which it really is. * The result of the considerations of this chapter is of twofold significance for our further studies. On the one hand, we have s een that there is a way out of the impasse into which modern scientific th eory has got itself as a result of the lack of a justifiable concept of force, and that this way is th e one shown by Reid and travelled by Goethe. 'We must become as little children again, if we will be philosophers', is as true for science as it is for philosophy. On the other hand, our investigation of the event which led Galileo to the discovery that nature is recorded in the langua ge of mathematics, has shown us that this discovery would not have been possible unless Galileo had in a sense become, albeit unconscious ly, a little child again. T hus the event that gave science its first foundations is an occurrenc e in man himself of precisely the same character as the one which we have learnt to regard as n ecessary for building science's new foundations. The only difference is that we are trying to turn into a deliberate and consciously handled method somethi ng which once in the past happened to a man without his noticing it. Need we wonder that we are challenged to do so in our day, when mankind is several centuries older than it was in the time of Galileo? 1 As to the terms 'kinetic' and 'kinematic', see Chapter II, page 30, footnote. 2 For the sake of our later studies it is essential that the reader does not content himself with merely following the above description mentally, but that he carries out the experiment himself."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 114 CHAPTER IX Pro Levitate (a) ALERTNESS contra INERTNESS In the preceding chapter we gained a new insight into the relationship between mass and force. We have come to see that our concept of force is grounded on empirical observation in no less a degree than is usuall y assumed for our concept of number, or size, or position, provided we do not confine ourselves to non-stere oscopic, colourless vision for the forming of our scientific wo rld-picture, but allow other senses to contribute to it. As to the concept mass, our discussion of the formula F = ma showed that force and mass, as they occur in it, ar e of identical nature, both having the quality of force. The factors F and m signify force in a different relationship to space (represented by the factor a). This latter fact now require s some further elucidation. In a science based on the Goethean method of contemplating the world of the senses, concepts such as 'mass in rest' and 'mass in motion' lack any scientific meaning (though for another reason than in the theory of Re lativity). For in a science of this kind the universe - in the sense propounded lately by Professor Whitehead and others - appears as one integrated whole, whos e parts must never be considered as independent entities unrelated to the whole. Seen thus, there is no mass in the universe of which one could say wi th truth that it is ever in a state of rest. Nor is there any condition of movement which could be rightly characterized by the attributes 'uniform' and 'straight line' in the sense of Newton's first law. This does not mean that such conditions never occur in our field of observation. But as such they have significance only in relation to our immediat e surroundings as a system of reference. Even within such limits these conditions ar e not of a kind that would allow us to consider them as the basis of a scientific world-picture. For as such they occur naturally only as ultimate, never as primev al conditions. All masses are originally in a state of curvilinear movement whose rates change continuously. To picture a mass as being in a state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line, as the result of no force acting on it, and to picture it undergoing a ch ange in the rate a nd direction of its motion as the result of some outer force work ing on it, is a sheer ab straction. In so far as mass appears in our field of observation as being in relative rest or motion of the kind described, this is always the eff ect of some secondary dynamic cause. If we wish to think with the course of the universe and not against it, we must not start our considerations with the state of (re lative) rest or uniform motion in a straight line and derive our definition of force from the assumption that there is a primary 'force-free' state which is altered under the action of some force, but we must arrange our definitions in such a way that they end up with this state. Thus Newton's first law, for instance, would have to be restated somewhat as follows: No physical body is ever"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 115 in a state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless it s natural condition is interfered with by the particular action of some force. Seen dynamically, and from the aspect of the universe as an interrelated whole, all aggregations of mass are the manifestati on of certain dynamic conditions within the universe, and what appears to us as a change of the state of motion of such a mass is nothing but a change in the dynamic relations hip between this part icular aggregation and the rest of the world. Let us now see wh at causes of such a change occur within the field of our observation. * In modern textbooks the nature of the cause of physical movement is usually defined as follows: 'Any change in the state of moveme nt of a portion of matte r is the result of the action on it of another portion of matter.' This represents a truth if it is taken to describe a certain kind of causation. In the ax iomatic form in which it is given it is a fallacy. The kind of causation it describes is, indeed, the only one which has been taken into consideration by the scientific mind of man. We are wont to call it 'mechanical' causation. Obviously, man's onlooker-consciousness is unable to conceive of any other kind of causation. For this consciousness is by its very nature confined to the contemplation of spatially apparent entities which for this reason can be considered only as existing spatially si de by side. For the one-eyed, colour-blind spectator, therefore, any change in the st ate of movement of a spatially confined entity could be attributed only to the action of another such entity outside itself. Such a world-outlook was bound to be a mechanistic one. We cannot rest content with this state of a ffairs if we are sincerely searching for an understanding of how spirit moves, forms, and transforms matter. We must learn to admit non-mechanical causes of physical effects, where such causes actually present themselves to our observation. In this re spect our own body is again a particularly instructive object of study. For here mechanical and non- mechanical causation can be seen working side by side in closest conj unction. Let us therefore ask what happens when we move, say, one of our limbs or a part of it. The movement of any part of our body is always effected in some way by the movement of the corresponding pa rt of the skeleton. This in turn is set in motion by certain lengthenings and contractions of the appropriate part of the muscular system. Now the way in which the muscles cause th e bones to move falls clearly under the category of mechanical causation. Certain portions of matter ar e caused to move by the movement of adjacent portions of matte r. The picture changes when we look for the cause to which the muscles owe their movements. For the motion of the muscles is not the effect of any caus e external to them, but is e ffected by the purely spiritual energy of our volition working directly into the physical substance of the muscles. What scientific measuring instruments have been able to regist er in the form of physical, chemical, electrical, etc., changes of the muscular substance is itself an effect of this interaction."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 116 To mark the fact that this type of causa tion is clearly distingu ished from the type called mechanical, it will be we ll to give it a name of its own. If we look for a suitable term, the word 'magical' suggests itself. The f act that this word has gathered all sorts of doubtful associations must not hinder us from adopting it into the terminology of a science which aspires to understand the worki ng of the supersensibl e in the world of the senses. The falling into disrepute of th is word is characteristic of the onlooker- age. The way in which we suggest it should be used is in accord with its true and original meaning, the syllable 'mag' signifying power or might (Sanskrit maha, Greek megas, Latin magnus, English might, much, also master). Henceforth we shall distinguish between 'mechanical' and 'm agical' causation, the latter being a characteristic of the majority of happ enings in the human, animal and plant organisms. 1 * Our next step in building up a truly dynamic pi cture of matter must be to try to obtain a direct experience of the condition of ma tter when it is under the sway of magical causation. Let us first remember what is the outstand ing attribute with which matter responds to mechanical causation. This is known to be inertia. By this term we designate the tendency of physical matter to resist any outwardly impre ssed change of its existing state of movement. This property is closely linked up with another one, weight. The coincidence of the two has of late become a puzzle to science, and it was Albert Einstein who tried to solve it by establishi ng his General Theory of Relativity. The need to seek such solutions falls away in a science which extends scientific understanding to conditions of matter in which weight and inertia are no longer dominant characteristics. What becomes of inertia when matter is subject to magical causation can be brought to our immediat e experience in the following way. (The reader, even if he is already familiar with this experiment, is again asked to carry it out for himself.) Take a position close to a smooth wall, so that one arm and hand, which are left hanging down alongside the body, are pressed over their entire length between body and wall. Try now to move the arm upwar d, pressing it against the wall as if you wanted to shift the latter. Apply all possible effort to this attempt, and maintain the effort for about one minute. Then step aw ay quickly from the wall by more than the length of the arm, while keeping the ar m hanging down by the side of the body in a state of complete relaxation. Provided all c onditions are properly fulfilled, the arm will be found rising by itself in accordance with the aim of the earlier effort, until it reaches the horizontal. If the arm is then lo wered again and left to itself, it will at once rise again, though not quite so high as before. This can be repeated several times until the last vestige of the automatic movement has faded away. Having thus ascertained by dire ct experience that there is a state of matter in which inertia is, to say the least, greatly diminish ed, we find ourselves in need of giving this"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 117 state (which is pres ent throughout nature wherever ma terial changes are brought into existence magically) a name of its own, as we did with the two types of causation. A word suggests itself which, apart from e xpressing adequately the peculiar self- mobility which we have just brought to our experience, goes well alongside the word 'inert' by forming a kind of rhym e with it. This is the term 'alert'. With its help we shall henceforth distinguish between matter in the inert and alert conditions. We shall call the latter state 'alertness', and in order to have on the other side a word as similar as possible in outer form to alertness, we suggest replacing the usual term inertia by 'inertness'. Thus we shall speak of matter as showing the attribute of 'inertness', when it is subject to mechanical causation, of 'alertness', when it is subject to magical causation. Anyone who watches attentively the sens ation produced by the rising arm in the above experiment will be duly impressed by th e experience of the alertness prevailing in the arm as a result of th e will's magical intervention. * In our endeavour to find a modern way of overcoming the conception of matter developed and held by science in the age of the onlooker-consciousness, we shall be helped by noticing how this conception fi rst arose historical ly. Of momentous significance in this respect is the discovery of the gaseous state of matter by the Flemish physician and experimenter, Joh. Ba ptist van Helmont (1577-1644). The fact that the existence of this state of ponde rable matter was quite unknown up to such a relatively recent date has been completely fo rgotten to-day. Moreover, it is so remote from current notions that anyone who now ca lls attention to van Helmont's discovery is quite likely to be met with incredulity. As a result, there is no account of the event that puts it in its true setting. In what follo ws pains are taken to pr esent the facts in the form in which one comes to know them th rough van Helmont's own account, given in his Ortus Medicinae. For reasons which need not be described he re, van Helmont studied with particular interest the various modifications in which carbon is capable of o ccurring in nature - among them carbon's combustion product, carbon dioxide. It was hi s observations of carbon dioxide which made him aware of a condition of matter whose properties caused him the greatest surprise. For he f ound it to be, at the same time, 'much finer than vapour and much denser than air'. It appeared to him as a complete 'paradox', because it seemed to unite in itself two c ontradictory qualities, one appertaining to the realm of 'uncreated things', th e other to the realm of 'created things'. Unable to rank it with either 'vapour' or 'air' (we shall s ee presently what these terms meant in van Helmont's terminology), he found himself in need of a special word to distinguish this new state from the other known states, both below and above it. Since he could not expect any existing language to possess a su itable word, he felt he must create one. He therefore took, and changed slightly, a word signifying a particular cosmic condition which seemed to be imaged in the new condition he had just discovered. The word was CHAOS. By shortening it a lit tle, he derived from it the new word"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 118 GAS. His own words explaining his c hoice are: 'Halitum ilium GAS vocavi non longe a Chaos veterum secretum.' ('I have called this mist Gas, owing to its resemblance to the Chaos of the ancients.') 2 Van Helmont's account brings us face to face with a number of riddles. Certainly, there is nothing strange to us in his descri bing carbon dioxide gas as being 'finer than vapour and denser than air'; but why did he call this a 'paradox'? What prevented him from ranking it side by side with air? As to air itself, why should he describe it as belonging to the realm of the 'uncreated th ings'? What reason was there for giving 'vapour' the rank of a particular condition of matter? And last but not least, what was the ancient conception of Chaos which led van Helmont to choose this name as an archetype for the new word he needed? To appreciate van Helmont's astonishment a nd his further procedure, we must first call to mind the meaning which, in accord ance with the prevailing tradition, he attached to the term Air. For van Helmont, Air was one of the four 'Elements', EARTH, WATER, AIR, and FIRE. Of these, the first two were held to constitute the realm of the 'created things', the other two that of the 'uncreated things'. A brief study of the old doctrine of the Four Elements is necessary at this point in order to understand the meaning of these concepts. * The first systematic teaching about the four el ementary constituents of nature, as they were experienced by man of old, was given by Empedocles in the fifth century B.C. It was elaborated by Aristotle. In this form it was handed down and served to guide natural observation through more than a thousand years up to the time of van Helmont. From our earlier descriptions of the changes in man's consciousness it is clear that the four terms, 'earth', 'water', 'air', 'fire', must have meant something different in former times. So 'water' did not signify merely the physical substance which modern chemistry defines by the formula H 2 O; nor was 'air' the mixture of gases characteristic of the earth's atmos phere. Man in those days, on account of his particular relationship with nature, was impressed in the first place by the various dynamic conditions, four in number, which he found prevailing both in his natural surroundings and in his own organism. With his elementary concepts he tried to express, therefore, the four basic cond itions which he thus experienced. He saw physical substances as being carried up and down between these conditions. At first sight some relationship seems to exist between the concept 'element' in this older sense and the modern view of the diffe rent states of materi al aggregation, solid, liquid, aeriform. There is, however, nothi ng in this modern view that would correspond to the element Fire. For heat in the sense of physical science is an immaterial energy which creates certain condi tions in the three material states, but from these three to heat there is no tran sition corresponding to the transitions between themselves. Heat, therefore, does not rank as a fourth condition by the side of the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 119 solid, liquid and aeriform states , in the way that Fire rank s in the older conception by the side of Earth, Water and Air. If we were to use the old terms for designa ting the three states of aggregation plus heat, as we know them to-day, we should say that there is a bord er-line dividing Fire from the three lower elements. Such a borde r-line existed in the older conception of the elements as well. Only its position was seen to be elsewhere - between Earth and Water on the one hand, Air and Fire on the ot her. This was expressed by saying that the elements below this line constituted the realm of the 'created things', those above it that of the 'uncreated th ings'. Another way of expre ssing this was by characterizing Earth and Water with the quality Cold; Air and Fire with the quality Warm. The two pairs of elements were thus seen as polar opposites of one another. The terms 'cold' and 'warm' must also be understood to have expressed certain qualitative experiences in which there wa s no distinction as yet between what is purely physical and what is purely spiritual. Expressions such as 'a cold heart', 'a warm heart', to 'show someone the cold shoul der', etc., still witn ess to this way of experiencing the two polar qualities, cold and warm. Quite generally we can say that, wherever man experienced some process of contraction, whether physical or non- physical, he designated it by the term 'cold' , and where he experienced expansion, he called it 'warm'. In this sense he felt contractedness to be the predominant characteristic of Earth and Water, expansiveness that of Air and Fire. With the help of these qualitative concep ts we are now in a position to determine more clearly still the difference between the older and the modern conceptions: in particular the difference between the aerifor m condition of matter, as we conceive of it to-day, and the element Air. Contractedne ss manifests as material density, or the specific weight of a particular substance. We know that this characteristic of matter diminishes gradually with its transition from the solid to the liquid and aeriform states. We know also that this last st ate is characterized by a high degree of expansiveness, which is also the outstanding property of heat. Thus there is reason to describe also from the modern point of view the solid and liquid states as essentially 'cold', and the aeriform state as 'warm'. But aeriform matter still has density and weight, and this means that matter in this state combines the two opposing qualities. Contrary to this, Air, as the second highest element in the old sense, is characterized by the pure quality, warm. Thus, when man of old spoke of 'air', he had in mind something entirely free from ma terial density and weight. 3 By comparing in this way the older and newer conceptions of 'air', we come to realize that ancient man must have had a concepti on of gravity essentially different from ours. If we take gravity in the modern sc ientist's sense, as a 'descriptive law of behaviour', then this behaviour is designated in the older do ctrine by the quality 'cold'. If, however, we look within the system of m odern science for a law of behaviour that would correspond to the quality 'warm', we do so in vain. Polarity concepts are certainly not foreign to the scientific mind, as the physics of electricity and"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 120 magnetism show. Yet there is no opposite po le to gravity, as there is negative opposite to positive electricity, etc. 4 In the older conception, however, the gravitat ional behaviour 'cold' was seen to be counteracted by an autonomous anti-gravitat ional behaviour 'warm'. Experience still supported the conviction that as a polar opposit e to the world subject to gravity, there was another world subject to levity. We refrain at this point from discussing how far a science which aspires to a spiritual understanding of nature, including material processes, needs a revival - in modern form - of the old conception of levity. In our present context it suffices to realize that we understand man's earlier view of nature , and with it the on e still held by van Helmont, only by admitting levity equally with gravity into his world-picture. For the four elements, in particular, this meant that the two upper ones were regarded as representing Levity, the two lower ones Gravity. In close connexion with this polar concep tion of the two pairs of elements, there stands their differentiation in to one realm of created, anot her of uncreated, things. To understand what these terms imply, we must turn to the ancient concept, Chaos, borrowed by van Helmont. To-day we take the word Chaos to mean a condition of mere absence of order, mostly resulting from a destruction of existing fo rms, whether by nature or by the action of man. In its original sense the word meant the exact opposite. When in ancient times people spoke of Chaos, they meant the wo mb of all being, th e exalted realm of uncreated things, where indeed forms such as are evident to the eye in the created world are not to be found, but in place of them are the archetypes of all visible forms, as though nurtured in a spirit ual seed-condition. It is the st ate which in the biblical narration of the creati on of the world is described as 'without form and void'. From this Chaos all the four elements are born, one by one, with the two upper ones retaining Chaos's essential characteristic in that they are 'without form' and tend to be omnipresent, whilst the two lower ones const itute a realm in which things appear in more or less clearly outline d space-bound forms. This is what the terms 'uncreated' and 'created' imply. How strictly these two realms were distingui shed can be seen by the occurrence of the concept 'vapour'. When with the increasing in terest in the realm of created things - characteristic of the spectator-consciousness which, in view of our earlier description of it, we recognize as being itself a 'created thing' - the need arose for progressive differentiation within this realm, the simple division of it into 'earth' and 'water' was no longer felt to be satisfactory. After all, above the liquid state of matter there was another state, less dense than water and yet presenting itself through more or less clearly distinguishable space-bound objects, such as the mists arising from and spreading over ponds and meadows, and the clouds hovering in the sky. For this state of matter the term 'vapour' had become customary, and it was used by van Helmont in"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 121 this sense. By its very properties, Vapour be longed to the realm of the created things, whereas Air did not. It was the intermediary position of the newly discovered state of matter between Vapour and Air, that is, be tween the created and the uncreated world, which caused van Helmont to call it a paradox; and it was its strange resemblance, despite its ponderable nature, to Chaos, which prompted him to name it - Gas. * Since it could not have been the gaseous st ate of matter in the form discovered by van Helmont, what particular condition of natu re was it to which the ancients pointed when using the term Air? Let us see how th e scriptures of past human cultures speak of air. In all older languages, the words used to designate the element bound up with breathing, or the act of breathi ng, served at the same time to express the relationship of man to the Divine, or even the Divine itself. One need think only of the words Brahma and Atma of the ancient Indians, the Pneuma of the Greeks, the Spiritus of the Romans. The Hebrews expressed the same idea when they said that Jehovah had breathed the breath of life into man and th at man in this way became a living soul. What lies behind all these words is the feeling familiar to man in those times, that breathing was not only a means of keeping the body alive, but that a spiritual essence streamed in with the breath. So long as this condition prevaile d, people could expect that by changing their manner of breathing th ey had a means of bringing the soul into stronger relationship with spiritual Powe rs, as is attempted in Eastern Yoga. Remembering the picture of man's spiritual- physical evolution which we have gained from earlier chapters, we ar e not astonished to find how different this early experience of the breathing process was fr om our own. Yet, together with the recognition of this difference there arises an other question. Even if we admit that man of old was so organized that the experi ence of his own breathing process was an overwhelmingly spiritual one, it was, after all, the gaseous substance of the earth's atmosphere which he inhaled, and exhale d again in a transformed condition. What then was it that prevented men - apparent ly right up to the time of van Helmont - from gaining the slightest inkling of the ma teriality of this substance? To find an answer to this question, let us resort on ce more to our method of observing things genetically, combined with th e principle of not consideri ng parts without considering the whole to which they organically belong. In modern science the earth is regarded as a mineral body whereon the manifold forms of nature appear as mere additions , arising more or less by chance; one can very well imagine them absent without th is having any essential influence on the earth's status in the universe. The truth is quite different. For the earth, with everything that exists on it, forms a single w hole, just as each separate organism is in its own way a whole."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 122 This shows that we have no right to imagine the earth without men, and to suppose that its cosmic conditions of being would then remain unaltered - any more than we can imagine a human being deprived of so me essential-organ and remaining human. Mankind, and all the other kingdoms of na ture, are bound up organically with the earth from the start of its existence. Moreove r, just as the highest plants, seen with Goethe's eyes, are the spiritual originators of the whole realm of plants - the creative Idea determining their evolution - so we see man, the highest product of earth evolution, standing behind this evolution as its Idea from the first, and determining its course. The evolutionary changes which we observe in the earth and in man are in fact a single process, working through a va riety of manifested forms. From this conception of the parallel evoluti on of earth and man light falls also on the historic event represented by van Helmont's discovery. Besides being a symptom of a revolution in man's way of experiencing the atmosphere, it speaks to us of some corresponding change in the spiritual-physical condition of the atmosphere itself. It was then that men not only came to think differently about air, but inhaled and exhaled an air that actually was different. To find out what kind of change this was, let us turn once more to man's own organi sm and see what it has to say concerning the condition under which matter is capable of being influenced by mechanical and magical causation respectively, in the sense already described. What is it in the nature of the bones that makes them accessible to mechanical causation only, and what is it in the musc les that allows our will to rouse them magically? Bones and muscles stand in a defi nite genetic relationship to each other, the bones being, in relation to the muscles, a late product of organic development. This holds good equally for everything whic h in the body of living nature takes the form of mineralized deposits or coverings . Every kind of organism consists in its early stages entirely of livi ng substance; in the course of time a part of the organism separates off\" and passes over into a more or less mineralized c ondition. Seen in this light, the distinction between bones and muscles is that the bones have evolved out of a condition in which the muscles persis t, though to a gradually waning degree, throughout the life-time of the body. The substa nce of the muscles, remaining more or less 'young', stands at the opposite pole fr om the 'aged' substance of the bones. Hence it depends on the 'age' of a piece of matter whether it responds to magical or mechanical causation. Let us state here at once, th at this temporal distinction has an essential bearing on our understanding of evolutionary processes in general. For if mineral matter is a late product of evolution - and nothi ng in nature indicates the c ontrary - then to explain the origins of the world (as scientific theo ries have always done) with the aid of events similar in character to those whic h now occur in the mineral realm, means explaining them against nature's own evidence. To find pictures of past conditions of the earth in present-day nature, we must look in the regions where matter, because it is still 'youthful', is played through by the magical working of purposefully active spiritual forces. Thus, instead of seeing in them the chance results of blind volcanic and similar forces, we must recognize in th e formation and layout of land and sea an"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 outcome of events more closely resemb ling those which occur during the embryonic development of a living organism. What, then, does van Helmont's discovery of the gaseous state of matter tell us, if we regard it in the light of our newly acquire d insight into the trend of evolution both within and without man? When, in the c ourse of its growing older, mankind had reached the stage which is expresse d by the emergence of the spectator- consciousness-consciousness, that is, base d on a nervous system which has grown more or less independent of the life forces of the organism - the outer elements had, in their way, arrived at such a state that man began to inhale an air whose spiritual- physical constitution corresponded exactly to that of his nervous system: on either side, Spirit and Matter, in accordance with the necessities of cosmic evolution had lost their primeval union. * Our extension of the concept of evolution to the very elements of nature, whether these are of material or non-material kind, and our recognition of this evolution as leading in general from a more alert to a more inert condition, at once open the possibility of including in our scientific world-picture certain facts which have hitherto resisted any inclusion. We mean t hose manifold events of 'miraculous' nature, of which the scriptures and the oral traditi ons of old are full. What is modern man to make of them? The doubts which have arisen concerning even ts of this kind have their roots on the one hand in the apparent absence of such occurrences in our day, on the other in the fact that the laws of nature derived by sc ience from the present condition of the world seem to rule them out. 5 In the light of the concept of the world's 'ageing' which we have tried to develop here, not only do the relevant reports beco me plausible, but it also becomes understandable why, if such ev ents have taken place in the past, they fail to do so in our own time. To illustrate this, let us take a few instances which are symptomatic of the higher degree of youthfulness which wa s characteristic in former times in particular of the element of Fire. The role which Fire was capable of playing in man's life at a time when even this element, in itself the most youthful of all, was more susceptible to magic interference than of late, is shown by the manifold fi re-rites of old. In those days, when no easy means of fire-lighting were available, it was usual for the needs of daily life to keen a fire burning all the time and to kindle other fires from it. Only in cases of necessity was a new fire lit, and then the only way was by the tedious rubbing together of two pieces of dry wood. Then both the maintenance of fires, and the deliberate kindling of a new fire, played quite a special role in the ceremonial orde ring of human society. Historically, much"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 124 the best known is the Roman usage in the Temple of Vesta. On the one hand, the unintentional extinction of the fire was re garded as a national calamity and as the gravest possible transgression on the part of the consecrat ed priestess charged with maintaining the fire. On the other hand, it wa s thought essential for this 'everlasting' fire to be newly kindled once a year. This took place with a special ritual at the beginning of the Roman year (1st March). The conception behind such a ritual of fire -kindling will become clear if we compare with it certain other fire-rites which were pr actised in the northern parts of Europe, especially in the British Is les, until far on in the Christ ian era. For example, if sickness broke out among the cattle, a wide spread practice was to extinguish all the hearth-fires in the district and then to ki ndle with certain rites a new fire, from which all the local people lit their own fires once more. Heavy penalties were prescribed for anyone who failed to extinguish his own fire - a failure usuall y indicated by the non- manifestation of the expected healing infl uence. In Anglo-Saxon speaking countries, fires of this kind were known as 'needfires'. The spiritual significance of these fires cannot be expressed better than by the meaning of the very term 'needfire'. This word does not derive, as was formerly believed, from the word 'need', meaning a 'fir e kindled in a state of need', but, as recent etymological research has shown, from a root which appears in the German word nieten - to clinch or rivet. 'Needfire' th erefore means nothing less than a fire which was kindled for 'clinching' anew th e bond between earthly life and the primal spiritual order at times when for one r eason or another there was a call for this. This explanation of the 'needfire' throws light also on the Roman custom of re- kindling annually the sacred fire in the Te mple of Vesta. For the Romans this was a means of reaffirming year by year the c onnexion of the nation with its spiritual leadership; accordingly, they chose the time wh en the sun in its year ly course restores - 're-clinches' - the union of the world-spirit with earthly nature, for the rebirth of the fire which throughout the rest of the year was carefully guarded against extinction. Just as men saw in this fire-kindling a wa y of bringing humanity into active relation with spiritual powers, so on the other hand were these powers held to use the fire element in outer nature for the purpose of making themselves actively known to mankind. Hence we find in the records of a ll ancient peoples a unanimous recognition of lightning and thunder on the one hand, a nd volcanic phenomena on the other, as means to which the Deity resorts for in tervening in human destiny. A well-known example is the account in the Bible of the meeting of Moses with God on Mount Sinai. As occurrence in the ear ly history of the Hebrews it gi ves evidence that even in historical times the fire element of the earth was sufficiently 'young' to serve the higher spiritual powers as an instrument for the direct expression of their will. (b) LEVITY contra GRAVITY"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 125 We said earlier in this chapter that a scie nce which aspires to a spiritual understanding of the physical happenings in nature must gi ve up the idea that inertness and weight are absolute properties of matter. We were able at once to t ackle the question of inertness by bringing to our immediate obser vation matter in the state of diminished inertness, or, as we proposed to say, of al ertness. We are now in a position to go into the other question, that of we ight or gravity. Just as we found inertness to have its counterpart in alertness, both being existi ng conditions of matter, so we shall now find in addition to the force of gravity anot her force which is the exact opposite of it, and to which therefore we can gi ve no better name than 'levity'. * Already, indeed, the picture of nature which we gained from following Goethe's studies both of the plant and of meteorol ogical happenings has brought us face to face with certain aspects of levity. For when Go ethe speaks of systole and diastole, as the plant first taught him to see them and as la ter he found them forming the basic factors of weather-formation, he is really speaking of the ancient concepts, 'cold' and 'warm'. Goethe's way of observing nature is, in fact, a first step beyond the limits of a science which kept itself ignorant of levity as a cosmic counterpart to terrestrial gravity. To recognize the historical significan ce of this step, let us turn our glance to the moment when the human mind became aware that to lay a proper foundation for the science it was about to build, it had to exclude any idea of levity as so mething with a real existence. Many a conception which is taken for gran ted by modern man, and is therefore assumed to have been always obvious, was in fact established qu ite deliberately at a definite historical moment. We have seen how this applies to our knowledge of the gaseous state of matter; it app lies also to the idea of th e uniqueness of gravity. About half a century after van Helmont 's discovery a treatise called Contra Levitatem was published in Florence by the Accademia del Cimento. It declares that a science firmly based on observation has no right to speak of Levity as something claiming equal rank with, and opposite to, Gravity. This attitude was in accord with the st ate into which human consciousness had entered at that time. For a consciousness whic h is itself of the quality 'cold', because it is based on the contracting forces of the body, is naturally not in a position to take into consideration its very opposite. Therefore, to speak of a force of levity as one felt able to speak of gravity was indeed without meaning. Just as there was historical necessity in this banishing of levity from science at the beginning of the age of the spectator-consciou sness, so was there historical necessity in a renewed awareness of it arising when the time came for man to overcome the limitations of his spectator - relationship to the world. We find this in Goethe's impulse to search for the action of polarities in nature. As we shall see later, it comes to its clearest expression in Goethe's optical conceptions."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 126 Another witness to this fact is Ruskin, th rough a remark which bears in more than one sense on our present subject. It occurs in his essay, The Storm-Cloud of the Ninteenth Century. In its context it is meant to warn th e reader against treating science, which Ruskin praises as a fact-finding instrument, as an interpreter of natural facts. Ruskin takes Newton's conception of gravity as the all-moving cause of the universe, and turns against it in the following words: 'Take the very top and centre of scientific interpretation by the greatest of its masters: Newton explained to you - or at least was once supposed to explain, why an apple fell; but he never thought of explaining th e exact correlative but infinitely more difficult question, how the apple got up there.' This remark shows Ruskin once again as a true reader in nature's book. Looking with childlike openness and intensity of particip ation into the world of the senses, he allows nature's phenomena to impress themselves upon his mind without giving any preconceived preference to one kind or another. This enab les him not to be led by the phenomenon of falling bodies to overlook th e polarically opposite phenomenon of the upward movement of physical matter in th e living plant. Ruskin's remark points directly to the new world- conception which must be striven for to-day - the conception in which death is recognized as a secondary form of existence preceded by life; in which levity is given its rightfu l place as a force polar to gravity; and in which, because life is bound up with levity as death is with gravity, levity is recognized as being of more ancient rank than gravity. * In proceeding now to a study of levity we sh all not start, as might be expected, with plants or other living forms. We are not yet equipped to und erstand the part played by levity in bringing about the pr ocesses of life; we shall co me to this later. For our present purpose we shall look at certain macr otelluric events - events in which large areas of the earth are engaged - taking our examples from meteorology on the one hand and from seismic (volcanic) processes on the other. In pursuing this course we follow a met hod which belongs to the fundamentals of a Goetheanistic science. A few words about this method may not be out of place. When we strive to read the book of nature as a script of the spirit we find ourselves drawn repeatedly towards two realms of natural phenomena. They are widely different in character, but studied together they render legible much that refuses to be deciphered in either realm alone. These re alms are, on the one hand, the inner being of man, and, on the other, the phenomena of macrotelluric and cosmic character. The fruitfulness of linking together these two will become clear if we reflect on the following. The field of the inner life of man allows us , as nothing else does, to penetrate it with our own intuitive experience. For we ourselves are always in some sense the cause of"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 127 the events that take place there. In order to make observations in this region, however, we need to bring about a certain awakening in a part of our being which - so long as we rely on the purely natural forces of our body - remains sunk in more or less profound unconsciousness. If this realm of events is more intimatel y related than any ot her to our intuitive experience, it has also the characteristic of remaining closed to any research by external means. Much of what lies beyond the scope of external observation, however, reveals itself all the more clearly in the realms where nature is active on the widest scale. Certainly, we must school ourselves to read aright the phenomena which come to light in those realms. And on ce more we must look to the way of introspection, previously mentioned, for aid in investing our gaze with the necessary intuitive force. If we succeed in this, then the heavens will become for us a text wherein secrets of human nature, hidden fr om mere introspecti on, can be read; while at the same time the introspective way en ables us to experience things which we cannot uncover simply by observing the outer universe. Apart from these methodological considera tions, there is a further reason for our choice. Among the instances mentioned earlie r in this chapter as symptoms of a greater 'youthfulness' prevailing in nature, a nd particularly in the element Fire, at a comparatively recent date, were the manifest ations of the Divine-Spiritual World to man reported in the Bible as the event on Mount Sinai. There, thunder and lightning from above and volcanic action from below form the setting for the intercourse of Jehovah with Moses. To-day the function of these types of phenomena, though metamorphosed by the altered conditions of the earth, is not essentially different. Here, more than in any other sphere of her ac tivities, nature manife sts that side of her which we are seeking to pe netrate with understanding. * Let us start with an observation known to the present writer from a visit to the Solfatara, a volcanic region near Naples. The Solfatara itself is a trough surrounded by hilly mounds; its smooth, saucepan-like bottom, covered with whitish pumice-sand, is pitted with craters containing violently boiling and fuming mud - the so-called fango , famous for its healing properties. All around sulphurous fumes issue from crevices in the rocks, and in one special place the Solfatara reveals its subterranean activity by the emergence of fine, many- coloured sand, which oozes up like boiling liquid from the depths below. The whole region gives the impression of being in a stat e of labile balance. How true this is becomes apparent if one drops pieces of burning paper here and there on the ground: immediately a cloud of smoke and steam rises. The effect is even more intense if a burning torch is moved about over one of the boiling fango holes. Then the deep answers instantly with an extraordinary inte nsification of the boiling process. The hot mud seems to be thrown into violent turm oil, emitting thick clouds of steam, which soon entirely envelop the spectator near the edge."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 128 The scientific mind is at first inclined to see in this phenomenon the mechanical effect of reduced air-pressure, due to the highe r temperatures above the surface of the boiling mud, though doubts are raised by the unu sual intensity of the reaction. The feeling that the physical explanation is in adequate is strengthened when the vapours have thinned out and one is surprised to see that every crack and cranny in the Solfatara, right up to the top of the trough, shows signs of increased activity. Certainly, this cannot be accounted for by a cause-and-effect nexus of the kind found in the realm of mechanical causation, where an effect is propagated from point to point and the total effect is the sum of a number of partia l effects. It looks rather as if the impulse applied in one spot had calle d for a major impulse which was now acting on the Solfatara as a whole. As observers who are trying to understa nd natural phenomena by recognizing their significance as letters in na ture's script, we must l ook now for other phenomena which can be joined with this one to form the relevant 'word' we have set out to decipher. All scientific theories concerning the cau ses of seismic occurrences, both volcanic and tectonic, have been conceived as if th e spatial motion of mineral matter were the only happening that had to be accounted for. No wonder that none of these theories has proved really satisfactory even to mech anistically orientated thinking. Actually there are phenomena of a quite different kind connected with the earth's seismic activities, and these need to be taken into equal account. There is, for instance, the fact that anim als often show a premonition of volcanic or tectonic disturbances. They become rest ive and hide, or, if domestic, seek the protection of man. Apparently, they react in this way to changes in nature which precede the mechanical events by which man registers the seismic occurrence. Another such phenomenon is the so-called earthquake-sky, which the present writer has had several occasions to witness. It consists of a peculiar, almost terrifying, intense discoloration of the s ky, and, to those acquainted with it, is a sure sign of an imminent or actual earthquake somewhere in the corresponding region of the earth. This phenomenon teaches us that the change in the earth's condition which results in a violent movement of her crust, involves a re gion of her organism far greater than the subterranean layers where the cause of the purely mechanical events is usually believed to reside. 6 That man himself is not excluded from expe riencing directly the super-spatial nature of seismic disturbances is shown by an event in Goethe's life, reported by his secretary Eckermann, who hims elf learnt the story from an old man who had been Goethe's valet at the time. 7 This is what the old man, whom Eckerm ann met by accident one day near Weimar, told him: 'Once Goethe rang in the middle of the night and when I entered his room I found he had rolled his iron bed to the wi ndow and was lying there, gazing at the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 129 heavens. \"Have you seen nothing in the sky? \" asked he, and when I answered \"No\", he begged me to run across to the sentry a nd inquire of the man on duty if he had seen nothing. He had not noticed anyt hing and when I returned I found the master still in the same position, gazing at the sky. \"Listen, \" he said, \"this is an important moment; there is now an earthquake or one is just going to take place.\" Then he made me sit down on the bed and showed me by what signs he knew this.' When asked about the weather conditions, the old man said: 'It wa s very cloudy, very still and sultry.' To believe implicitly in Goethe was for him a matter of course, 'for things always happened as he said they would'. When ne xt day Goethe relate d his observations at Court, the women tittered: 'Goethe dreams' (' Goethe schwÃ¤rmt '), but the Duke and the other men present believed him. A few weeks later the news reached Weimar that on that night (5th April, 1783) part of Me ssina had been destroyed by an earthquake. There is no record by Goethe himself of the nature of the phenomenon perceived by him during that night, except for a brief rema rk in a letter to Mme de Stein, written the following day, in which he claims to have seen a 'northern light in the south-east' the extraordinary character of which made him fear that an earthquake had taken place somewhere. The valet's report makes us inclined to think that there had been no outwardly perceptible phenomenon at all, but that what Goethe believed he was seeing with his bodily eyes wa s the projection of a purely supersensible, but not for that reason any less objective, experience. In a picture of the seismic activities of th e earth which is to comprise phenomena of this kind, the volcanic or tect onic effects cannot be attribut ed to purely local causes. For why, then, should the whole meteorolog ical sphere be in volved, and why should living beings react in the way described? Cl early, we must look for the origin of the total disturbance not in the interior of the earth but in the expanse of surrounding space. Indeed, the very phenomenon of the Solfatara, if seen in this light, can reveal to us that at least the volcanic moveme nts of the earth's crust are not caused by pressure from within, but by suction from w ithout - that is, by an exceptional action of levity. We recall the fact that the whole Solfatara phenomenon had its origin in a flame being swayed over one of the fango holes. Although it remains true that the suction arising from the diminished air pressure over the hole cannot account for the intense increase of ebullition in the hole itself, not to speak of th e participation of the entire region in this increase, there is the fact th at the whole event star ts with a suctional effect. As we shall see in the next chapter, any local production of heat interferes with the gravity conditions at that spot by shifting the balance to the side of levity. That the response in a place like the Solfatara is what we have seen it to be, is the result of an extraordinary lability of the equilibrium be tween gravity and levity, a characteristic appertaining to the earth's volcanism in general. For the people living near the Solfatara it is indeed common knowledge that there are times when this lability is so great that the slightest local disturbance of the kind we have described can provoke destructive er uptions of great masses of subterranean"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 130 mud. (At such times access to the Solfatara is prohibited.) We shall understand such an eruption rightly if we pict ure it as the counter-pole of an avalanche. The latter may be brought about by a fragment of matte r on a snow-covered mountain, perhaps a little stone, breaking loose and in its des cent bringing ever-accumulating masses of snow down with it. The levity -process polar to this demons tration of gravity is the production of a mightily growing 'negative avalanche' by comparatively weak local suction, caused by a small flame. * Earlier in this chapter (page 150) we said that if we want to understand how spirit moves, forms and transforms matter, we must recognize the existence of non- mechanical (magical) causes of physical effects. We have now found that the appearance of such effects in nature is due to the operations of a particular force, levity, polar to gravity. Observation of a nu mber of natural happenings has helped us to become familiar in a preliminary way w ith the character of this force. Although these happenings were all physical in appear ance, they showed certain definitely non- physical features, particularly through their peculiar relationship to three-dimensional space. More characteristics of this ki nd will appear in the following pages. In this way it will become increasingly cl ear that in levity we have to do with something which, despite its manifesting char acteristics of a 'force' not unlike gravity and thereby resembling the latter, differs e ssentially from anything purely physical. It is only by its interactions with gravity that levity brings about events in the physical world-events, however, which are themselves partly of a physi cal, partly of a superphysical kind. Seeing things in this as pect, we are naturally prompted to ask what causes there are in the world which make gravity and levity interact at all. This question will find its answer in due course. First, we must make ourselves more fully acquainted with the various a ppearances of the gravity-le vity interplay in nature. 1 In this sense Ruskin's description of the working of the spirit in the plant as one that 'catches from chaos water, etc., etc., and fastens them in to a given form' points to magical action. 2 For Van Helmont, owing to the Flemish pronunciation of the letter G, the two words sounded more alike than their spelling suggests. 3 In a later chapter we shall have opportunity to determine what distinguishes Air from Fire, on the one hand, and Water from Earth on the other. 4 It is this apparent uni-polarity of gravity which has given Professor Einstein so much trouble in his endeavour to create a purely gravitational world-picture with bipolar electricity and magnetism fitting into it mathematically. 5 See the 'Bishop Barnes' controversy of recent date. 6 To the same category belong the mighty thunderstorms which in some parts of the world are known to occur in conjunction with earthquakes."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 7 See Goethe's Conversations with Eckermann (translated by J.

But the character of the forces which are thus liberat ed makes it equally clear that this is not the borderland he was looking for. Nature - by which we mean physical nature - has in fact two borders, one touching the real m of the intramaterial energies which are liberated by disrupting the structure of atom ic nuclei, the other leading over into creative Chaos, the fountain-he ad of all that appears in nature as intelligent design. It was Crookes's fate to open the road wh ich has brought man to nature's lower border and even across it, although he himself was in search of her upper border. What he was denied, we are in a position to achi eve to-day, provided we do not expect to succeed by methods similar to those of atomic physics, and do not look for similar results. To show that there is a fourth state of ma tter, rightly so called, which represents in actual fact the upper border of nature, and to point the way that leads to it and across it, is the purpose of this chapter. * From our previous comparison of the ol der conception of the four elementary conditions of nature with that now held of the three states of ponderable matter, we may expect that the fourth state will have something in common with heat. Heat is indeed the energy which transforms matter by carrying it from the solid to the liquid and gaseous states. Not so obvious is the f act that heat, apart from being an agent working at matter in this way, is the very esse nce underlying all material existence, out of which matter in its three ponderable st ates comes into being and into which it is capable of returning again. Such a concepti on of matter was naturally absent from the age of the Contra-Levitatem orienta tion of the human mind. To create this conception, a new Pro-Levitate orientation is required. Apart from producing liquefaction and vaporiz ation, heat has also the property of acting on physical matter so that its volume increases. Both facts are linked together by science through the thermodynamic concepti on of heat. As this conception firmly"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 133 blocks the road to the recogniti on of the role of heat as th e fourth state of matter, our first task will be to determine our own sta ndpoint with regard to it. Further obstacles on our way are the so-called Laws of Cons ervation, which state that no matter and no energy - which for present-day science have become one and the same thing - can ever disappear into 'nothing' or come into being out of 'nothing'. This idea, also, will therefore require our early attention. 2 * In the light of our previous studies we sha ll not find it difficult to test the reality-value of the thermodynamic conception of heat. As we know of mass through a definite sens e-perception, so we know of heat. In the latter case we rely on the sense of warmth. In Chapter VIII we took the opportunity to test the objectivity of the information rece ived through this sens e. Still, one-eyed, colour-blind observation is naturally unable to take account of these sense-messages. To this kind of observation nothing is accessible, we know, except spatial displacements of single point -like entities. Hence we fi nd Bacon and Hooke already attributing the sensation of warmth to minute fast-moving particles of matter impinging on the skin. Some time later we find Locke taking up the same picture. We see from this how little the mechanical theo ry of heat owes to empirical facts. For even in Locke's time the connexion betw een heat and mechanical action, as recognized to-day, was completely unknown. With this idea firmly rooted in his mind, modern man had no difficulty in using it to explain both thermal expansion and the effect of heat on the different states of matter, and so, finally, these states themselves. Ther mal expansion was thus attributed to an increase in the average distance between th e assumed minute partic les, caused by an increase in their rate of movement; the liq uid state was held to differ from the solid, and similarly the gaseous from the liquid, by the interspaces between the particles becoming relatively so great that the gr avitational pull between them became too weak to hold them together. Tested from a view-point outside the onlooker-consciousne ss, this whole picture of the interaction between matter and heat appears to run count er to the cosmic order of things in a way typical of other spectator-theories. Anci ent man, if confronted with this picture, would have said that it means explaining th e element Fire by the quality Cold. For each of those minute particles, in its solidity and state of spatial separation from the others, represents an effigy of th e earth and thereby the element Earth itself. He would be unable to understand why phenomena of the 'warm' element Fire should be explained by its very opposite. Moreover, Fire forms part of the ever 'youthful' realm of the world, whereas anything which exists as a spatiall y discernible entity, capable of being moved about mechanicall y, must have grown cosmically 'old'. That Ruskin was as much on the alert in regard to this theory as he was in regard to Newton's theory of gravitation, is show n by the following utterance from his The"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134 Queen of the Air. Obviously stirred by Tyndall's newly published treatise, Heat as a Mode of Motion, Ruskin felt the need to criticize the endeavour of contemporary science 'to simplify the various forms of energy more and more into modes of one force, or finally into mere motion, co mmunicable in various states, but not destructible', by declaring that he woul d himself 'like better in order of thought 3 to consider motion as a mode of heat than heat as a mode of motion'. These words of Ruskin touch also on the law of conservation of energy, of which we said that it also called for a preliminary examination. What we now have to find out is the factual basis on which this law rests. * The conception of the law of conservation of energy arose from the discovery of the constant numerical relation between h eat and mechanical work, known as the mechanical equivalent of heat. This disc overy was made at about the same time by Joule in England and J. R. Mayer in Ge rmany, although by entirely different routes. Joule, a brewer, was a man of practical bent. Trained by Dalton, the founder of the atomic theory, in experimental resear ch, he continued Rumford's and Davy's researches which they had undertaken to prove that heat is not, as it was for a time believed to be, a ponderable substance, but an imponderable agent. As a starting-point he took the heating effect of electric currents. The fact th at these could be generated by turning a machine, that is , by the expenditure of mechanical energy, gave him the idea of determining the amount of work done by the machine and then comparing this with the amount of heat generated by the cu rrent. A number of ingenious experiments enabled him to determine with increasing exactitude the numerical relation between work and heat, as well as to establish the absolute constancy of the relation. This he regarded as proof of the mechanical theory of heat, which he had taken from Rumford and Davy. What simpler explanat ion could there be for the constant numerical relation between work and heat th an the conception th at transformation of one form of energy into another was simply a transmission of motion from one object to another? From the quantitative equali ty of expended and generated energy was it not natural to argue the quali tative similarity of the two forms of energy, which only externally seemed different? It was by quite a different path that the Heilbronn docto r, Mayer, arrived at his results. To escape from the narrowness of his South German home town, he went, while still a youth, as doctor to a Dutch ship sailing to Java. When in the tropics he treated a number of sailor s by blood-letting, he observed that the venous blood was much nearer in colour to the paler arterial blood than was usual at home. This change in the colour he attributed to the dimini shed intensity of bodily combustion, due, he believed, to the higher temperature of the tropics. Scarcely had this thought passed through his mind than it induced another - that of a universal interrelationship between all possibl e forms of energy. This last idea so took"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 135 possession of him that during the return voyage, as he himself related, he could scarcely think of anything but how to prove the correctness of his idea and what the consequences would be for the general view of nature. From the moment of his return he devoted his life to practical research into the connexion between the various manifestations of energy. It was in this wa y that he was led to the determination of the so-called mechanical equivalent of h eat, shortly before the same discovery was made in a quite different manner by Joule. If one considers how slender a connexion there was between Mayer's observation on the sailors in Java and the idea of the quant itative equilibrium of all physical nature- forces, and if one contrasts this with the fa naticism he showed dur ing the rest of his life in proving against all obstacles the correct ness of his idea, one must feel that the origin of the thought in Mayer's mind lay elsewhere than in mere physical observations and logical deductions. Confir mation of this may be found in what Mayer himself declared to be his view concerning the actual grounds for the existence of a constant numerical asso ciation between the various manifestations of natural energy. So far as science allowed Mayer any cred it for his work, this was based on the opinion that through his disc overy he had provided the final vindication of the mechanical theory of heat. This judg ment, however, was only piling one wrong upon another. Mayer's destiny was truly tragic. When he began to publicize his conviction of the numerical equilibrium between spent and created energy, he met with so much scepticism, even derision, that from sheer despair his mind at times became clouded. When at last toward the end of his life he received the recognition his discovery deserved (not before being dragged thr ough a painful priority dispute which Joule forced upon him and lost), the scientists ha d begun to use his idea for bolstering up a hypothesis directly counter to the idea whic h had led him to his discovery, and for the sake of which he had accepted so much suffering. Mayer's spiritual kin are not to be found am ong the heat-theorists of his time, such as Helmholtz and others, but among thinkers of the stamp of Goethe, Howard and Ruskin. His basic idea of the inner connexi on between all forms of energy in nature corresponds entirely with Goet he's idea of metamorphosis. Just as Goethe saw in the ur-plant the Idea common to all plant-fo rms or, in the various plant-organs, the metamorphosis of one and the same ur-o rgan, so was Mayer convinced of the existence of an ur-force which expressed it self in varying guis es in the separate energy-forms of nature. In the picture of the physical universe which hovered before him, the transformation of one form of en ergy into another - such as mechanical energy into electrical, this into chemical and so on - was somewhat similar to Goethe's picture of the organic life of th e earth, in which the metamorphosis of one living form into another consta ntly occurred. 'There is in nature', said Mayer, 'a specific dimension of immaterial constitution which preserves its value in all changes taking place among the objects observed, whereas its form of appear ance alters in the most manifold ways.'"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 136 For the physicist, accustomed to a purely qua ntitative observation of nature, it is difficult to comprehend that Mayer could ha ve arrived at the thought of a constant quantitative relation between the various ma nifestations of natural energy, without deriving from it the conviction of their quali tative indentity - i. e., without concluding from the existence of the mechanical heat - equivalent that heat is itself nothing else than a certain form of spatial movement . Mayer actually had a picture directly contrary to the mechanistic conception. For him, the arising of heat represented a disappearance of mechanical energy. If this, then, was Mayer's belief, what was it that convinced him of the existence of a numerical balance between appearing and va nishing energy, even before he had any experimental proof? Later in this book there will be occasion to introduce a concept of number in tune with our qualitative world- outlook. What led Mayer to look upon number as an expression of existing spiritual associations in nature will then become clear. Let this much be said here, that number in the unive rse has quite different functions from that of serving merely as an expression for a to tal of calculable items, or as a means of comparing spatial distances. It is in the natu re of the onlooker-consciousness that it is unable to interpret numerical equality betw een natural phenomena save as indicating the presence of an equal number of calcu lable objects or of spatial movements of equal magnitude. It was therefore consistent for such a consciousness to regard the discovery by Mayer of the mechanical he at-equivalent as a confirmation of the existing mechanical conception of heat. For Mayer such an interpretation was not necessary. His conviction of the existence of an ur-force, manifesting through metamor phosis in all natural forces, led him to expect a constant numerical relation amongs t these, without requiring him to deny the objective existence of qualitative differences , as these displayed themselves in the field of phenomena. He was spiritually akin to Goethe, also, in that he guarded himself strictly against substituting for the contents of our perception conveyed by nature purely hypothetical entities which, while fashioned after the world of the senses, are, in principle, imperceptible . Mayer sought after a truly empirically founded concept of force, and his method was that of reading from all the various manifestations of force which were open to sense observation. One such manifestation, capable of empirical determination, was the balance between appearing and disappearing energy. Science treated Mayer in the same way as it treated Howard. It took from him what it wanted for its purpose without concerning its elf with the epistemological principle which had led him to his discovery. Thus it was that Mayer's discovery led to most important consequences for the development of modern technical devices, whereas it was the fate of his guiding idea to be first derided, then misunderstood and finally forgotten. The consequence was that the knowledge of the numerical equilibrium between created and expended energy in the economy of nature has widened more and more the abyss separating spirit and matte r in human life, instead of leading, as"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 137 indeed it might have done, to a bridgi ng of the abyss. The thought, therefore, regarding the appearing and di sappearing of measurable cosmic substance, to which we are led when following Goethe's method of observing nature, stands in no sort of contradiction to what Mayer himself conceive d as the relation of the various forms of energy to one another, and the maintenan ce of the numerical balance between them. * Having thus determined our standpoint with regard to the thermodynamic theory of heat and the law of conservation, we ma y proceed to the study, first of the phenomenon of thermal expansion, and then of the effect of heat on the various states of physical matter, by applying to them, unimpeded by any preconceived mechanistic idea, what we have learnt through our prev ious studies. We must start by developing a proper picture of the dynamic cond ition of matter in the solid state. In a solid body the material substance is centred on an inner point, the so-called centre of gravity - a characteris tic which such a body shares with the earth as a whole. Likewise, two such bodies exert on one anot her the same influence that the earth exerts on each of them: they try to assu me the shortest possible distance from each other. Since the days of Faraday scien ce has been accustomed to ascribe these phenomena to the existence of certain fields of force, connected with each body and working on one another through the intermediary space. It is to this concept of the field of force that we must now give speci al attention. For the fi eld-concept, in the form introduced by Faraday into scientific thinking, is one of the few scientific concepts which have been obtained by being 'read' from the corresponding phenomena themselves, and which therefore retain their validity in a science which is based on the method of reading. According to the field-concept, terrestrial manifestations of gravity are due to the earth's being the bearer of a gravitatio nal field centred within the globe, and extending thence in all directions thr ough space, across and beyond the earth's body. Every point in space, both inside and outside the earth, is characterized by a definite intensity of this field, the so-called gravitationa l potential. This is subject to variations due to the presence of other physical masses, which carry their own fields of gravity. What happens between such masses and that of the earth, as well as mutually between such masses themselves, is brought about by the particular conditions in space resulting from the interpenet ration of the various fields. It is essential to real ize that all fields dealt with by physical science, the gravitational, electric, magnetic - however much they differ otherwise - have this one characteristic in common, that they have a centre where the field is at it s highest intensity, diminishing as the distance from the centre in creases. Motion in such a field naturally takes place from regions of lower to those of higher intensity - in other words, it follows the rising potential of the field. This accounts for the tendency of physical masses to arrive at the shortest possible distance between them."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 138 It was natural for the modern mind to picture a dynamic condition of the kind just described, that is, one in which the centre and source, as it were, is a point round which the dynamic condition spreads with steadily diminishing strength as the distance from the point grows. For su ch is the condition of man's head-bound consciousness. The locus from which modern man watches the world is a point within the field of this consciousness, and the intensity with which the world acts on it diminishes with increasing spatial distance from this point. This is the reason why levity was banished from scientific i nquiry, and why, when the field-concept was created by the genius of Faraday, it did not occur to anyone that with it the way was opened to comprehend field-types other than the centric one characteristic of gravity and kindred forces. To make use of the fiel d-concept in this other way is one of the tasks we have to undertake if we are to overcome the impasse in which present-day scientific cognition finds itself. To develop a picture of the type of field represented by levity, let us recall certain results from the observations of the last chapter. There the volcanic phenomenon, when taken in its wider implications, made us realize that the upward movement of physi cal masses, in itself part of the total phenomenon, is due to a dynamic cause which we had to describe, in contrast to centripetally working pressure, as periphera lly working suction. Of this concept of suction we must now observe that we may apply it with justification only if we realize that suction can be caused in two di fferent ways. In the sense in which we are wont to use the term, suction is the result of a difference of pressure in adjacent parts of space, the action taking place in the dire ction of the minor pressure. Apart from this, however, suction can occur also as a result of the outward-bound increase of the strength of a levity-field. It is in this sense that we may speak of the seismic movements of the earth as being caused by suction acting from without. In th e same sense we may say that the upward movement of the saps in the plant (to whic h Ruskin pointed as being responsible for the apple appearing at the t op of the tree) and with it the entire growth-phenomenon in the plant world, is due to peripheral suction. Considerations of this kind l ead one to a picture in whic h the earth is seen to be surrounded and penetrated by a field of for ce which is in every respect the polar opposite of the earth's gravitational field. As the latter has its great est intensity at its centre, which is identical with the centre of the earth's globe, so has the levitational field its greatest intensity at its circumference which is somewhere in the width of the universe. (Later considerations will enable us to locate its pos ition more precisely.) As the gravity-field decreases in strength with increasing distance from the centre of the field, that is, in the outward direction, so does the levity-field decrease in strength with increasing distance from its periphery, or in the inward dire ction. In both fields the direction of movement is from regions of lower to those of higher intensity. This"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" 139 is why things 'fall' under the influence of gravity and 'rise' under the influence of levity. 4 * How does thermal expansion read as a letter in nature's script when seen in the light of the two contras ting field-concepts? Let us, for simplicity's sake, imagine a sphe rically shaped metallic body, say, a ball of copper, which we expose to the influence of heat. As we have seen, it is the centrically orientated gravity-field which gives the ball its permanency of shape. Consequently, the dynamic orientation of the material constituting its body is directed towards the interior of the body itself. Now, the moment we bring heat to bear on the body we find its surface moving in the outward direction. The whole mass is clearl y under the influence of some suction which is directed on to the body from outside . Just as the plants grow in the anti- gravitational direction as a result of the suct ional effect of levity (other factors which account for its growing into a particular shap e, etc., being left out of consideration), so our copper ball grows in volume by being sucked away from its centre of gravity. It is the action of heat whic h has changed the ratio between gravity and levity at this spot in such a way as to allow levity to produce this effect. 5 What we have thus found to be the true nature of the event perceived as a body's growth in volume under the influence of h eat has a definite ef fect on our conception of spatially extended matter as such. For a physical body is always in some thermal state which may be regarded as higher than another, and it may therefore be regarded as being at all times thermally expanded to some extent. Hence, it is all the time under the sway of both gravitational pressure and anti-gravitationa l suction. In fact, we may say ideally that, if there were no field work ing inwards from the cosmic periphery, the entire material content of the earthly realm would be reduced by gravitation to a spaceless point; just as under the sole influe nce of the peripheral field of levity it would dissipate into the universe. To ordinary scientific thi nking this may sound paradoxical, but in reality it is not. Observation of the nature of solid matte r has led atomistic thought to regard a physical body as a heap of molecules so far apart that by far the greater part of the volume occupied by the body is just 'empty ' space. In the scientific picture of molecules constituting a physical body, of at oms constituting the molecules, of electrons, protons, etc., constituting the atom s, all separated by spaces far exceeding the size of the elementary particles th emselves, we find reflected, in a form comprehensible to the onlooker-consciousness, the fact that matter, even in the solid state, is kept in spatial ex tension by a field of force rela ting it to the cosmic periphery. *"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 140 With this picture of solid matter as being he ld in spatial extensi on by its subjection to gravity and levity alike, we proceed to a study of the liquid and gaseous states of matter, while taking into account the role of heat in bringing these states about. Following out our method of seeking to gain knowledge of a phenomenon by regarding it as part of a gr eater whole, let us ask what sort of change a portion of physical substance undergoes in its relation to the earth as a whole when, for instance, through the influence of heat, it passes from a solid to a liquid state. Here we must keep in mind that it is part of the nature of a liquid to have no form of its own. The only natural boundary of a liqui d substance is its upper su rface. Since this surface always lies parallel with the surface of the earth it forms part of a sphere, the centre point of which is identical with that of the gravitational centre of the earth. The passage of a portion of matter from solid to liquid thus signifies that it ceases to possess a centre of gravity of its own and is now merely obedient to the general gravity-field of the earth. We can thus speak of a transition of matter from the individual to the planetary condition. This is what heat brings about when a solid body melts. A large part of the heat used in melting is known to be absorbed by the substance during the process of melting. This is indica ted by the thermometer remaining at the temperature of the melting-point once this has been reached, until the whole of the melting substance has liquefied. Physics here speaks of 'free' heat becoming 'latent'. From the Goethean point of view we s ee heat passing through a metamorphosis. Whereas, previously, heat was perceptible to our sense of warmth, it now manifests as a gravity-denying property of matter. In order to obtain an idea of the liquid state of matte r corresponding to reality, we must take into account yet another of its characteristics. When the heat becomes latent, it goes even further in contradict ing gravity than by robbing matter of its own point of gravity and relating it to the earth's centre of grav ity. This effect is shown in the well-known urge of all liquids to eva porate. Hence we must say that even where matter in a liquid state preserves its own surface, this does not by any means represent an absolute boundary. Above the surface there proceeds a continuous transition of substance into the next higher condition th rough evaporation. We see here the activity of heat going beyond the mere denial of gr avity to a positive affirmation of levity. With the help of this conception of the integration of the liquid state within the polarity of gravity and levit y, we are now able to draw a picture of the earth which, once obtained, answers many a question left unanswered by current scientific notions, among them the question why the earth's vol canic activity is c onfined to maritime regions. Regarding the distribution of land and water on the earth's surface, we may say that to an observer in cosmic space th e earth would not look at all like a solid body. Rather would it appear as a gigantic 'drop' of water, its surface interspersed with solid formations, the continents and other land masses. Moreover, the evidence assembled"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 141 ever since Professor A. Wegener's first re searches suggests that the continents are clod-like formations which 'float' on an underl ying viscous substance and are able to move (very slowly) in both the vertical a nd horizontal directions . The oceanic waters are in fact separated from the viscous substr atum by no more than a thin layer of solid earth, a mere skin in comparison with the si ze of the planet. Furthe r, this 'drop' of liquid which represents the earth is in c onstant communication with its environment through the perpetual evaporation from the o cean, as well as from every other body of water. This picture of the earth shows it ly ing under the twofold influence of the compressive force of gravity and the suck ing force of levity. Wherever land meets sea, there levity tends to prevail over gravity. It is in maritime regions, accordingly, that the inner strata of the earth succumb most readily to those sudden changes in the gravity-levity tension wherei n we have recognized the or igin of seismic occurrences. * Turning to the gaseous condition, we reali ze that although even he re matter retains traces of a connexion with terre strial gravity, levity is now the dominant factor. There are three characteristics of the gaseous condition which bring this out. One is the extreme readiness of gases to expand when heated; we see here how much easier than with solid substances it is for heat to overcome the influence of gravity. The second characteristic is the property of gases, peculiar to them, of expanding spontaneously, even when not heated. Here we find gase ous matter displaying a dynamic behaviour which at lower stages occurs only under the stimulus of heat. The third characteristic is shown by the fact that a ll gases, unlike solids or liq uids, respond with the same increase of volume to a given rise of temperature, however diverse their other qualities may be. Once gases are mixed, theref ore, they cannot be separated merely by raising or lowering the temp erature. Here we find the unifying effect of the cosmic periphery prevailing over the differentia ting effect of terrestrial gravity. At this point we may recall Goethe's reply to the botanist, Wolff, who had ascribed the metamorphosis of plant-organs from r oot to blossom to a gradual stunting or atrophy of their vegetative force, whereas it was clear to Goethe that simultaneously with a physical retrogression, there is a sp iritual progress in the development of the plant. The fact that all Wolff's efforts to see clearly did not save him from 'seeing past the thing' seemed to Goethe an inevitable result of Wolff's failure to associate with the eyes of the body those of the spirit. Exactly the same thing holds good for the se quence of physical stat es of matter which we are considering here. Observation of th is sequence with the bodily eyes alone will show nothing but a reduction of the specifi c gravity of the material concerned. He who is at pains to observe also with the eye of the spirit, how ever, is aware of a positive increase of lightness going hand in hand with a decrease of heaviness. Regarded thus, the three ponde rable conditions form what Goethe would have called a 'spiritual ladder'. As 'rungs' of such a ladde r they clearly point to a fourth rung - that"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 142 is, a fourth state in which levity so far prevails over gravity that the substance no longer has any weight at all. This pictur e of the fourfold tr ansformation of matter calls for an inquiry into the transition between the third and fourth states, corresponding to the well-known transitions between the three ponderable states. * Our observations have led us to a concept of heat essentially differe nt from that held by modern science. Science looks on heat simply as a condition of ponderable matter. We, on the contrary, are led to recognize in heat a fourth condition into which matter may pass on leaving the three ponderable c onditions, and out of which it may emerge on the way to ponderability. Before showing that such transitions are ac tually known in nature, it may be well to discuss here an objection which the cust omary way of thinking might plausibly advance against our whole method. It could be said that to assume a continuation of the sequence of the three ponderable conditions in the manner suggested is justified only if, as solids can be turned into liquids and these into gases, so gases could be transformed into a fourth condition and, conversely, be produced from the latter. In reply it can be said that the fact of our not being able at present to change gases artificially into pure heat does not justify the conclusion that this is in principle impossible. We know from previous consid erations that the earth has reached an evolutionary stage at which all elements, in cluding fire, have in certain degree grown 'old'. This applies in quite a special degr ee to the manipulations to which man, led by his death-bound consciousness, has learnt to submit matter in his laboratories. To decide what is possible or not possible in nature, therefore, can by no means be left to the judgment of laboratory research. As is shown by the following instance, taken from the realm of vegetable life, a case of the creation of matter 'out of nothing' is already known to biology - though biology, bound in its concepts to the Law of Conservation, shows some natural reluctance to recognize the true significance of the phenomenon. The plant which performs this strange feat is the Tillandsia usneoides, indigenous to tropical America, and generally known as 'S panish Moss'. Its peculiarity is that it grows and flourishes without taking from its support any material whatsoever for the building up of its substance. It s natural habitat is the dry bark of virgin forest trees. Since civilization invaded its home it ha s acquired the habit of growing even on telegraph wires, which has given it the popular name of 'telegraph tresses'. Chemical analysis of this plant shows the presence of an average of 17 per cent iron, 36 per cent silicic acid and 1Â·65 per cent phosphoric acid. This applies to samples taken from districts where the rainwater - the only source from which the plant could extract these substances in physical form - contai ns at most 1Â·65 pe r cent iron, 0Â·01 per cent silicic acid and no phosphoric acid at all."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" 143 The Tillandsia phenomenon is to a certain extent reminiscent of another well-known plant activity. This is the pr ocess of assimilation of carbon from the carbon dioxide of the air. If we leave aside the change in the chemical combination which the carbon undergoes, there remains the picture of the pl ant drawing this matter to itself from its environment and at the same time subjecti ng it to a spatial co ndensation. A similar but even more far-reaching process is exhibite d by the Tillandsia as regards the three substances referred to above. From the c onditions given, it follows that the plant cannot possibly get these substances el sewhere than out of the surrounding atmosphere, and that in drawing upon th em it submits them to a high degree of condensation. A special role, however, is pl ayed by the phosphorus, which shows that the assimilative power of the plant is sufficient to transf orm phosphorus from a physically not traceable state into one of spatially bounded materiality. Following Goethe in his coining of th e concept of 'spiritual anas tomosis' for the pollinating process of plants, we can here sp eak of 'spiritual assimilation'. In this respect Tillandsia provides an in stance 'worth a thousa nd, bearing all within itself. For what nature here unmistakably de monstrates serves as an eye-opener to a universal fact of the plant kingdom and of na ture in general. The problem of the so- called trace-elements may serve as an illustration of this. Modern agricultural chemistry has found of a number of chemical elements that their presence in the soil in scar cely traceable amounts is necessa ry in order to enable the plant to unfold healthily its latent characteristics. All sorts of deficiencies in cultivated plants have led to a recogniti on that the soil is im poverished of certain elements by intensive modern cu ltivation, and that it is to the lack of these elements that the deficiencies are due. Much work has meanwhile been done in classifying the various deficiencies and in devising ways of giving the soil chemical substitutes for what is lacking. A large part of the work here involv ed could be saved were it only to be acknowledged that the soil ow es the natural occu rrence of the proper elements to a process which the plants themselves bring about in the soil, if men refrain from hindering them by cleverly thought-out methods of cultivation which fail to reckon with the nature of a living organism. Let us be clear what it is that occurs when a plant exhibits any of the observed abnormalities. Expressed in a Goethean ma nner, these are the consequence of an insufficient direction of the organic proce sses in the plant body by the spiritual plant- type underlying it. That which Ruskin called th e 'spirit' of the plant, and to which he drew attention in his aphorism 'Stand by Form against Force' (by 'form' all the peculiar qualities of the plan t are to be understood), is una ble to express itself in full measure. Now we know that, in order to unf old its activities on the physical plane, spirit requires 'young' matter - that is, matter which is eith er in, or has just emerged from, a purely dynamic state. Normally a de finite spiritual type co-ordinates the dynamic functions present in the superphys ical sphere of nature in the manner required to give the plant-organism its a ppropriate form. As, through the action of the"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 144 type, these functions are brought down from the sphere of levity into that of gravity, they condense to the corresponding material elements and thus reach the soil in material form via the physical organism of the plant. The pattern as usually seen is now reversed ; the presence of the various elements in the soil no longer appears as the origin of one or another function in the building up of the plant-body, but quite the reverse. The functions appear now as the cause, and the soil-elements as the effect. We may thus recognize the value of the latter as symptoms from which we can read the existe nce of a healthy connexion between the plant and the corresponding form-crea ting functions working on it from its surroundings. With this reversal of the relationship betw een cause and effect it is not, however, intended to represent the commonly accepted orde r of things as entirely incorrect. In the realm of life, cau se and effect are not so oneside dly fixed as in the realm of mechanical forces. We may therefore admit th at a reverse effect of the soil-elements upon the plant does take place. This is plai nly demonstrable in the case of phosphorus which, however, by reason of its appearance in the soil in proportions hardly to be called a mere 'trace', represents a borderline case. What may apply within limits to phosphorus is wholly valid for the trace-elemen ts - namely, that they are playing their essential role while they are themselves about to assume ponderable form. It thus becomes clear how mistaken it is to attempt to cure defi ciencies in plants by adding to the soil chemical substitutes for the trace-elements. In the condition in which this material is offered to the plant, it is truly 'old' material. In order to be able to use it functionally, the plant has first to convert it into the 'young' condition. This indeed happens whilst the material is risi ng in the plant combined with the juices drawn by the plant from the soil under the in fluence of levity-force. Only when this has occurred are the chemical elements ab le to serve the plant functionally. Thus, by trying to give help to the plant in this way, we injure it at the same time. For by forcing it to perform the operation described, its general life-forces are diminished. A seeming success brought about in this ma nner, therefore, will not last long. 6 There is, nevertheless, a way of helping the plant by adding to the soil certain material substances, provided these are fi rst brought into a pu rely dynamic condition. That this can be done is a fact long sin ce known, even if not recognized in its true significance. So far then, as serves the purpos e of this book, we shall deal with it here. * The method in question is associated w ith the school of medicine known as Homoeopathy, founded by the German doctor, Hahnemann. The word 'homoeopathy' means 'healing through like'; the basic princi ple is to treat disease symptoms with highly diluted substances which produce si milar symptoms if ingested in normal quantity. Experience has in fact shown that the physiological effect of a substance taken from external nature is reversed when the substance is highly diluted."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 145 The method of diluting, or 'potentizing', is as follows: A given volume of the material to be diluted is dissolved in nine times its volume of distilled water. The degree of dilution thus arrived at is 1:10, usually symbo lized as Ix. A tenth part of this solution is again mixed with nine times its bulk of water. The degree of dilution is now 1:100, or 2x. This process is continued as far as is found necessary for a given purpose. Insoluble substances can be dealt with in the same manner by first grinding them together with corresponding quantities of a neutral powder, generally sugar of milk. After a certain number of stag es the powder can be dissolv ed in water; the solution may then be diluted further in the manner de scribed. Here we have to do with transfer of the quality of a substance, itself insoluble, to the di ssolving medium, and then with the further treatment of the latter as if it were the original bearer of the quality concerned. This fact alone shows that potentization l eads into a realm of material effects at variance with the ordinary scientific concep tion of matter. Moreover, we can carry the dilutions as far as we please without de stroying the capacity of the substance to produce physiological reactions. On the contra ry, as soon as its original capacity is reduced to a minimum by dilution, furthe r dilution gives it the power to cause actually stronger react ions, of a different and usually opposite kind. This second capacity rises through stages to a variable maximum as dilution proceeds. A simple calculation shows - if we accept the or dinary scientific view as to the size of a molecule - that not a single molecule of the original substance will remain in the solution after a certain degr ee of dilution has been reached. Yet the biological and other reactions continue long afte r this, and are even enhanced. What this potentizing process shows is that, by repeated expansions in space, a substance can be carried beyond the ponderable conditions of matter into the realm of pure functional effect. The potentizing of physical substances thus gains a significance far wider than that of its medical use. 7 There opens up, for example, the possibility of stimulating deficient functions in the pl ant by giving it the corresponding elements in homoeopathic dose s. By this means the plant is brought into direct connexion with the relevant spir itual energy, and then left to carry out for itself the necessary process of materializ ation, instead of being forced by mere chemical additions to the soil first to potentize the substance itself. 8 The same principle holds good for man and b east. They also need 'young material' for their nourishment, so that the type active in them - which in animals is the group-soul of the species and in man is the single i ndividual - can express its true form and character. (We saw earlier th at the will requires 'young' mate rial in order to penetrate into the material layers of the muscles, as happens when the limbs are set in motion). In this respect, the difference between ensoul ed creatures and plants is that, what is harmful to plants is natural for men and an imals: when taking nourishment the latter are able to bring about quickly and purpos efully a transformation of matter into the purely dynamic state. Their metabolic system is designed to enable them to take alien material from outer nature and to transform it through the forces of the various"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 146 digestive enzymes; in the course of th is process the material passes through a condition of complete 'chaos'. * Having in this way established the existen ce of certain processe s of materialization and dematerialization in single organisms within the earth's vegetable and other kingdoms, we shall now turn to the earth as a whole to find out where - organic being that she herself is - she manipulates corre sponding processes on a macrotelluric scale. In an age following van Helmont's discovery of the gaseous state of matter and the statement of the Contra Levitatem maxim, men were bound to think that the circulation of atmospheric moisture was limite d to the three stages of liquid, vaporous (peculiar to the clouds, etc.) and the invisi ble aeriform condition. Yet the role played by clouds in the myths of early peoples s hows that they were once given a quite different status, between the 'created' and ' uncreated' worlds. Our observations lead to a corresponding conception, but along the path of knowledge, guided by sense- perception, as befits our own age. In discussing Howard's discovery of the stages of cloud-formation we found something lacking, for it was clear that th e three stages of cloud proper - stratus, cumulus and cirrus - have a symmetry which is disturbed by the addition of a fourth stage, represented by the nimbus. This showed that there was need for a fifth stage, at the top of the series, to es tablish a balanced polarity. We can now clear up this question of a fifth stage, as follows. In the three actual cloud-forms , gravity and levity are more or less in equilibrium, but in the nimbus gravity predominates, and the atmospheric vapour condenses accordingly into separate liqui d bodies, the drops of rai n. The polar opposite of this process must therefore be one in whic h cloud-vapour, under the dominating influence of levity, passes up through a transitional condition into a state of pure heat. Such a conception by no means contradicts the findings of external research. For meteorology has come to know of a heat-m antle surrounding the earth's atmosphere for which various hypothetical explanations have been advanced. Naturally, none of them envisages the possibility of atmos pheric substance changing into the heat- condition and back again. But if we lear n to look on the chain of cloud-forms as a 'spiritual ladder', then we must expect the chain to conclude with a stage of pure heat, lying above the cirrus-sphere. 9 The line of consideration pursued in the last part of this chapter has led us from certain observations in the plant kingdo m, concerning the coming into being of ponderable matter from 'nothing', to a corresponding picture of the earth's meteorological sphere. When discussing the plant in this respect we found as an instance 'worth a thousand, bearing all within itself the case of Tillandsia and more particularly the surprising appearance of phosphorus in it. Now, in the meteorological"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 147 realm it is once more phosphorus which gives us an instance of this kind. For there is the well-known fact of the presence of phosphorus in conspicuous quantities in snow without a source being traceable in the atmo sphere whence this substance can have originated in ponderable condition. The phos phorus appearing in snow, therefore, brings before our very eyes the fact that the heights of the atmosphere are a realm of procreation of matter. (In our next chapter we shall learn what it is in phosphorus that makes it play this particular role in both fields of nature . What interests us in the present context is the fact itself.) * The knowledge we have now gained concer ning the disappearance and appearance of physical water in the heights of the atmosphe re will enable us to shake off one of the most characteristic errors to which the onlooker-consciousness has succumbed in its estimation of nature. This is the interpreta tion of thunderstorms, and particularly of lightning, which has held sway since the days of Benjamin Franklin. Before developing our own picture of a thunde rstorm let us recognize that science has found it necessary to reverse the explan ation so long in Vogue. Whereas it was formerly taken for granted - and th e assumption was supposed to rest upon experimental proof - that the condensing of atmospheric vapour which accompanied lightning was the consequence of a release of electrical tension by the lightning, the view now held is that the el ectrical tension responsible for the occurrence of lightning is itself the effect of a sudden condensing process of atmospheric moisture. The reason for this uncertainty is that the physical conditions in the sphere where lightning occurs, according to other expe riences of electric phenomena, actually exclude the formation of such high tensions as are necessary for the occurrence of discharges on the scale of li ghtning. If we look at this fact without scientific bias we are once again reminded of the Hans Anders en child. We cannot help wondering how this child would behave in a physics class if the teacher, after vainly trying to produce a lightning-flash in miniature with the help of an electrical machine, explained that the moisture prevalent in the air was responsible for the fa ilure of the experiment, and that he would have to postpone it to a day when the air was drier. It would scarcely escape the Hans Andersen child that th e conditions announced by the teacher as unfavourable to the production of an electric spark by the machine, prevail in a much higher degree exactly where lightning, as a supposed electric spark, actually does occur. To conclude from the presence of electric te nsions in the earth's atmosphere as an accompaniment of lightning, in the way first observed by Franklin, that lightning itself is an electrical process, is to be under the same kind of illusion that led men to attribute electrical characte ristics to the human soul b ecause its activity in the body was found to be accompanied by electrical pr ocesses in the latter. The identification of lightning with the electric spark is a case of a conf usion between the upper and lower boundaries of nature, ch aracteristic of the onlooker-consciousness. As such, it"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 148 has stood in the way of a real understa nding both of non-electri cal natural phenomena and of electricity itself. What we observe in lightning is really an instantaneous execution of a process which runs its course continually in the atmosphe re, quietly and unnoticed. It is the process by which water reverts from the impondera ble to the ponderable condition, after having been converted to the former through levity set in action by the sun (as usually happens in a high degree just before a thunde rstorm). We form a true picture of the course of a storm if we say that nature en ables us to witness a sublime display of the sudden bringing to birth of matter in earthbound form. What falls to the ground as rain (or hail) is substantially identical with what was perceptible to the eye, a moment before, as a majestic light-phenomenon. The accompanying electr ical occurrence is the appropriate counter-event at nature's lower boundary. Since the two form part of a larger whole they necessarily occur together ; but the electrical occu rrence must not be identified with the event in the heavens. The reason for their conjunction will become clear later, when we shall show how el ectrical polarity arises from the polarity between gravity and levity. If one learns to view a th understorm in this way, its spiritual connexion with the earth's volcanic processes becomes manifes t; there is in fact a polar relationship between them. For just as in volcanic ac tivity heavy matter is suddenly and swiftly driven heavenwards under th e influence of levity, so in a storm does light matter stream earthwards under the influence of gravity. It is this combination of kinship and polar opposition which led people of old to regard both lightning in the heights and seismi c disturbances in the depths as signs of direct intervention by higher powers in the a ffairs of men. A trace of this old feeling lingers in the Greek word Î ̧ÎμÎ¹Î¿Î½ (theion), divine, which was used to denote both lightning and sulphur. Influenced by the sa me conception, the Romans regarded as holy a spot where lightning had struck the earth; they even fenced it off to protect it from human contact. Note in this respect also the biblical report of the event on Mount Sinai, mentioned before , telling of an interplay of volcanic and meteorological phenomena as a sign of the direct intervention of the Godhead. 1 See Chapter IV. The other title of the paper, 'Radia nt Matter', will gain significance for us in a later context. 2 Since the above was written, certain conclusions drawn from modern subatomic research have led some astro-physicists to the idea that hydrogen is continuously created in the cosmos 'out of nothing'. This does not affect the considerations of the present chapter. 3 Note the expression! 4 For a vivid description of the interplay of both ty pes of force in nature, see E. Carpenter's account of his experience of a tree in his Pagan and Christian Creeds. 5 Note how this picture of thermal expans ion fits in with the one obtained for the Solfatara phenomenon when we took into account a ll that is implicit in the latter,"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 149 6 This throws light also on the problem of the use of chemicals as artificial fertilizers. 7 See L.

Her aim was to examine the behaviour of matter on the way to and beyond the boundary of its ponderable existence. 8 Instead of using the trace-elements in mineral form, it is still better to use parts of certain plants with a strong 'functional tendency', specially prepared. This is done in the so-called Bio-Dynamic method of farming and gardening, according to Rudolf Steiner's indications. 9 Note, in this respect, the close of Goethe's poe m dedicated to the cirrus-formation and the poem inspired by his sight of a waterfall in the Bernese Al ps as indications of the fact that he was himself aware of the water-rejuvenating process in the higher reaches of the atmosphere. "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 150 CHAPTER XI Matter as Part of Nature's Alphabet In the preceding chapter we drew attention to the fact that any spatially extended mass is under the sway of both gravity a nd levity. We then saw that with the transition of matter from the solid via the li quid to the gaseous stat e, not only does the specific gravity of the substance decrease, but at the same time an increase takes place of what we might call 'specific levity'. In the gaseous state, therefore, we find gravity-bound matter becoming so far levity-bound that it assumes the property of actively expanding in space. Having once adopted the Goethean way of th inking-in-polarities, we may feel sure that there is somewhere in nature a ph enomenon which represents the polar opposite of the levity-gravity relationship peculiar to the gaseous state. In this latter state we find ponderable matter so far brought under the sway of levity that its behaviour is of a kind which van Helmont, when he first obs erved it, could not help describing as 'paradoxical'. Where, we must now ask, do we find imponderable essence so much under the sway of gravity that it shows th e correspondingly para doxical features? In other words, where does nature show levity concentrated in a limited part of space - that is, in a condition charact eristic of ponderable matter? Such concentrations of levity do indeed ex ist in varied forms. One is the 'warmth- body' represented by the blood-heat of the higher animals and man. There is, however, an occurrence of this kind also on the purely mine ral level of nature, and it is this which has particular significance fo r our present study of matter. We meet it in all physical substances wh ich have the peculiarity of being combustible. Our next task is to study certain fundamentals in regard to the different ways in which levity and gravity are found to be intertwi ned in combustible substances, manifesting through the difference of thei r relation to the process of combustion - that is, the process by which levity is restored to its or iginal condition. It is the aim of the present chapter to show that by doi ng justice to the imponderabl e aspect of combustion, the way is opened to a view of the 'elements' , as scientific chemistry understands them, which will be in line with our dynamic conception of matter. There is nothing surprising in the fact that a new conception of the chemical element can arise from a re-study of the process of combustion, if we remember that it was the picture of combustion, characteristic of the spectator-consciousness, which determined the conception of the chemical el ement as it prevails in modern science. Let us see how this conception came to pa ss historically in order to find where we stand to-day. *"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 151 With the establishment of the knowledge of a state of physical matter which, as the definition ran, 'neither results from a combin ation of other physical substances nor is resolvable into such', the conviction ar ose that man's searching mind had reached 'rock-bottom'. This conviction, however, wa s shaken when, with the discovery of radium, an element became known whose propert y it is to disintegrate into two other elements, helium and lead. Although this did not force science to abandon the element-concept altogether, it became necessary to find a new definition for it. This definition was established by Professo r W. Ostwald at the beginning of the present century, when he stated that the chemical element represents a condition of physical matter in which 'any chemical change results in an incr ease of weight'. In this way, the chemical concept of the element achieved a meaning which had actually been implicit in it from its first conception. For its very formation had been the outcome of the Contra-Levitatem maxim. The following glance over the history of chemistry will show this. The birth of chemistry as a science, in the modern sense, is closely connected with a revolutionary change in th e conception of what can be called the chemical arch- process-combustion, or, to use a more scie ntific term, oxidation. This change arose out of the Contra-Levitatem maxim and the new conception of heat which this maxim required. In the old doctrine of the four Elements, Heat had been conceived as a manifestation of the element of Fire, and s o, together with Air, as belonging to the realm of the 'uncreated things'. Hence the release of heat from created substance was always felt to be a sacred act, as is shown by the fire rites of old. Modern man's conception of the same pr ocess is revealed in the answer one invariably receives from both layman and sc ientist when they are asked what they understand by combustion. It is describe d as a process through which oxygen combines with the combustible substance. And yet this side of combustion, first observed by J. Priestley (1771), is neither the one for the sake of which man produces combustion in the service of his everyday life, nor is it at all observed by ordinary sense-perception. Nevertheless, to describe the obvious fact, that combustion is liberation of heat from the combustible subs tance, will hardly o ccur to anyone to-day. This shows to what extent even the scient ifically untrained consciousness in our time turns instinctively to the tangible or weighabl e side of nature, so that some effort is required to confess simply to what th e eye and the other senses perceive. During the first hundred years af ter the establishment of the Contra-Levitatem maxim, man's situation was in a certain se nse the opposite of this. Then, people were struggling hard to get away from the ol d concept which saw in combustion nothing but the liberation of a super-t errestrial element from ea rthly fetters. This struggle found expression in a theory of heat which at that time greatly occupied scientific thinking. It is the so-calle d phlogiston-theory first proposed by the chemist Stahl (1660-1734)."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" 152 This theory reveals the great uncertainty in to which man's thinking about the world of the senses had arrived at that time. Clingi ng to ideas inherited from antiquity, man's consciousness was already so far restri cted to the forming of pure matter-bound concepts that he was tempted to conceive he at as a material element. To this heat- substance the name 'phlogiston' was given. At the same time, under the Contra- Levitatem maxim, it was impossible to conceive of substance except as ponderable substance. This led to the conviction that whenever heat appears as a result of some treatment of matter (combustion or friction), the material substance subject to this treatment must lose weight. The experiments of Lavoisier (1743-94), which he undertook following Priestley's discovery of the role of oxygen in combus tion, put an end to this theory. These experiments are rightly regarded as the actual beginning of modern chemistry. In Lavoisier we find an observer of nature who was predominantly interested in what the scales could tell about changes in substa nces. It was from this aspect that he investigated the process of oxidation. What had already been observed by a few others, though without being taken seriously by them, he found confirmed - that, contrary to the phlogiston - theory, matte r does not lose weight through oxidation but gains weight. Further experiments proved be yond doubt that in all chemical reactions the total weight of the co mponents remained constant. However much the substance resulting from the chemical reaction of ot hers might differ from these, its weight always proved to be the sa me as their total weight. What else could be concluded from the apparent unchangeability of we ight throughout all the chemical happenings in nature than that the ponderable world-co ntent was of eternal dur ation? We see here how much modern chemistry and its concept of the chemical element has been ruled right from the start by the one-sided grav ity concept of the onlooker-consciousness. Together with the overcoming of the fallacy that heat is a ponde rable substance (full certainty was indeed establis hed only some time later th rough the investigations of Davy and Rumford into heat generated by fr iction) - human thinking was led into a one-sided conception of combustion which was merely the opposite of the one held earlier. Whereas formerly man's mind was pre-eminently occupied by the liberation of the imponderable element through combusti on, it now turned entirely to what goes on in the ponderable realm. As we have seen, one outcome of this one -sided view of com bustion was the modern concept of the chemical element. To-day our task is to overcome this concept by taking a step corresponding to the one that led to it, that is, by a study of combustibility which does justice to both sides of the process involved. * As objects of our observation we choose thre e chemical elements all of which have the property of combustibility: Sulphur, Phosphorus, and Carbon. As will become clear, our choice of these thr ee is determined by the fact th at together they represent an instance 'worth a thousand, bearing all within itself."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 153 We begin by comparing Sulphur and Phosphorus . In their elementary state they have in common the fact that any chemical cha nge is bound up with an increase in their weight. In this state both are combustible. Ap art from this similarity, there is a great difference between them, as the way of stor ing them illustrates. For while elementary sulphur needs only an ordinary container, phosphorus has to be kept under cover of water in order to prevent the atmospheric oxygen from touching it. The reason is that the combustible state is natural for sulphur , but not for phosphorus, the latter's natural state being the oxidized one. This different relationship of sulphur and phosphorus to the oxidizable (reduced) and the oxidized stat e manifests itself in all their chemical reactions. To object here that the different reactions of the two substances are due only to the difference of their respective temperatur es of ignition, and that above these temperatures the difference will more or less disappear (all combustible substa nces at a sufficiently high temperature becoming more or less similar to phosphorus), would not meet the argument. For what matters here is just how the partic ular substance behaves at that level of temperature on which the earth unfolds her normal planetary activity. To ignore this"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 154 would be to violate one of the principles we have adopted from Goethe, which is never to derive fundamental concepts of nature from observations obtained under artificial conditions. Sulphur and phosphorus are thus seen to represent two polar ically opposite tendencies with regard to the levity-gravity cohere nce which breaks up when combustion occurs. In the case of sulphur, the ponderable and imponderable entities appear to cling together; in the case of phosphorus, they seem to be anxious to part. These two different tendencies - which are characterist ic of many other substances and represent a basic factor in the chemical happenings of the earth - are in thei r own way a pair of opposites. Since each of them represents in itself a relationship between two poles of a polarity-gravity and levity - so in their mu tual relationship they represent a 'polarity of polarities'. In Fig. 4 an attempt has been made to represent this fact by a symbolic diagram. In this figure the shaded part represen ts the imponderable, the black part the ponderable entity. In the left-hand sym bol both are shown in a relationship corresponding to the one char acteristic of sulphur; in the right-hand figure the relationship is charact eristic of phosphorus. Here we have an instance of a kind of pol arity which belongs to the fundamentals of nature as much as does the levity-gravity polarity itself. Wherever two poles of a polarity meet, they have the possibility of being connected in two ways which in themselves are again polarically opposite. Our further studies will bring up various other instances of this kind, and will show us that part of the epistemological trouble in which science finds itself to-day results from the fact that the scientific mind has been unable to distinguish betw een the two kinds of polarity - that is, as we shall say henceforth, between polarities of the first order (primary polarities) and polarities of the second order (secondary polarities). In actual fact, the distinction between the tw o orders of polarity has been implicit in the descriptions given in this book right from the start. Remember, in this respect, how the picture of the thr eefold psycho-physical structur e of man, which has proved a master-key for unlocking the most varied scientific problems, was first built up. There, 'body' and 'soul' represented a polar ity which is obviously one of the first order. By our observation of the human or ganism, in relation both to the different functions of the soul and to the different main organic sy stems, we further recognized the fact that the ways in which body and s oul are interrelated ar e polarically opposite in the region of the brain and nerves and in the region of the metabolic processes, which again results in two polarically opposite act ivities of the soul, mental on the one hand, and volitional on the other. In what we calle d the pole-of-consciousness and the pole-of-life we therefore have a clea r polarity of the second order, and so in everything that is connected with these two, as our further discussions will show. Remembering that our first occasion to conc ern ourselves overtly with the concept of polarity was in connexion with the four elements, we may now ask whether the old"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" 155 doctrine did not embrace some conception of secondary polarity as well as of primary polarity, and if so, whether this might not prove as helpful in clarifying our own conceptions as was the primary polarity, co ld-warm. That this is indeed so, the following description will show. Beside the two qualities cold and warm the doctrine of the four elements pointed to two further qualities forming in themselves a pair of opposites, namely, dry and moist. Just as the four elements were seen as grouping themselves in two pairs, Fire- Air on the one hand, Water-Earth on the other, the first bei ng characterized by th e quality warm, the second by cold, so were they seen to form two opposing groups, Fire-Earth and Air- Water, of which one was characterized by the quality dry, the other by the quality moist. Fig. 5 shows how the four elements in their totality were seen to arise out of the various combinations of the four qualities. In this diagram the element Earth appears as a combination of the qualities Dry and Cold; Water of Cold and Moist; Air of Mo ist and Warm; Fire of Warm and Dry. As a result, Earth and Fire, besides representing opposite poles, are al so neighbours in the diagram. Here we encounter a picture charac teristic of all earlier ways of looking at the world: the members of a system of phenomena, when ranked in due order of succession, were seen to turn b ack on themselves circle-wise - or, more precisely, spiral-wise."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 156 In what way do the qualities dry and moist form a polarity of the second order, and how do they represent the chem ical polarity characteristic of sulphur and phosphorus as well as all the other sec ondary polarities dealt with in this book? To understand this we must submit the couple dry-moist to the same scrutiny as we applied to cold and warm in our earlier discus sion of the four elements. It lies in the nature of thi ngs that we instinctively asso ciate these qualities with the solid and liquid states of matter respectivel y. This certainly agrees with the diagram given above, where the elements Earth and Water are distinguished precisely by their connexion with these two charact eristics. Yet, in addition to this, the qualities dry and moist are found to be characteristic also of Fire and Air respectively, though with the difference that they are linked not with the quality cold, as in the case of the lower elements, but with the quality warm. So we see that the concepts Dry and Moist, as they lived in the old picturing of them, m ean a good deal more than we understand by them to-day. That these two respective attributes do not belong exclusively to the solid and the liquid states of matter can be seen at once by observing the different reactions of certain liquids to a solid surface which they touch. One need only recall the difference between water and quicksilver. If water r uns over a surface it leaves a trail; quicksilver does not. Water clings to the si de of a vessel; again, quicksilver does not. A well-known consequence of this difference is that in a narrow tube the surface of the liquid - the so-called meniscus - stands higher at the circumference than at the centre in the case of water; with quicksilver it is just the reverse. In the sense of the two qualities, dry and moist, water is a 'moi st' liquid; quicksilver a 'dry' one. On the other hand, the quality of moistness in a solid substance appears in the adhesive power of glue. Let us now see how, in accordance with the scheme given in Fig. 5, the four qualities in their respective combinations constitute the four elements. From the description we shall give here it will be realized how little such ancient schemes were based on abstract thoughts, and how much they we re read from the facts of the world. Moreover, a comparison with our description of the four stages of matter, given in the previous chapter, would show how far the conceptual content of the old doctrine covers the corresponding facts when they are read by the eye of the modern reader in nature, notwithstanding the changes natu re has undergone in the meantime. The element Fire reveals its attributes of warm and dry in a behaviour which combines a tendency to dynamic expansion w ith a disinclination to enter into lasting combination with the other elements. Co rrespondingly, the behaviour of the element Earth unites a tendency to cont raction with an inclinati on to fall out of conjunction with the other elements. Thus the attribut e, dry, belongs equally to pure flame and sheer dust, though for opposite reasons. Distin ct from both these elements are the middle elements Water and Air; with them the attribute, moist, comes to expression in their tendency both to inte rpenetrate mutually and to absorb their neighbours - the liquid element absorbing solid matter and the aeriform element taking up heat. What"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 157 distinguishes them is that water has a 'col d' nature, from which it gains its density; while air has a 'warm' nature, to which it owes its tendency to expand. In the most general sense, the quality 'moist' applies wher ever two different entities are drawn into some kind of intimate rela tionship with one another; 'dry' applies where no such relationship prevails. Seen thus, they reveal themselves as a true polarity of the second order, for they desc ribe the relationship between two entities which already exists, and, in the case of th e four elements, are themselves a polarity. As such, they characterize precisely those polar relationships of the second order on which the threefold structure of man, we found, is based. For from the physical, as much as from the superphysical aspect the nerve-system represents the 'dry' part, and the metabolic system the 'moist' part of man's being. The same is true of the relationship between the soul and the surrounding world at both poles. Here we have the antithesis between the 'dry' onlooker-rel ationship of the inte llect to the world, conceived as a mere picture whose esse nce remains outside the boundaries of the soul, and the 'moist' intermingling of the wi ll-force with the actual forces of the world. * It needs no further explanation to realize that sulphur and phosphorus, by the way in which levity and gravity are interlinked in each of them, are representatives of these very qualities 'moist' and 'dry'. As such they are universally ac tive bearers of these qualities in every realm of nature's varied ac tivities, as their physical presence in such cases confirms. Consequentl y, sulphur is found in the pr otein-substances of the human body wherever they are bearers of meta bolic processes, while the presence of phosphorus is characteristic of the nerves and bones. (Although its full significance will become clear to us only later, th e fact may here be mentioned that the composition of the bone-material in the differe nt parts of man's skeleton, as scientific analysis has shown, is such that the content of phosphate of calcium in proportion to carbonate of calcium is higher in all those pa rts which are spherically shaped, such as the upper parts of the skull and the upper ends of the limb-bones.) In particular the plant reveals clearly th e functional significan ce of phosphorus as the bearer of the quality 'dry'. For its healt hy growth the plant needs the quality 'dry' in two places: at the root, where it unites w ith the element earth, and in the flower, where it opens itself to the fire element. Root and flower as distinct from the middle parts of the plant are both 'dry' formations. In a still higher degree this applies to the seed, which must separate itself from the mother plant to produce a separate new organism. All these are functions in the pl ant which, as was mentioned in the last chapter, require phosphorus for their healthy performance. Our examination of phosphorus and sulphur fr om the functional point of view throws light also on their effect on the alternating conditi ons of waking and sleeping, necessary for the life of the higher organisms. This rhyt hmic change, which affects especially the nervous system , is an alternation between the qualities dry and moist."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 158 Disturbance of this alterna tion in one direction or the other makes it difficult for the organism to react in full wakefulness or nor mal sleep. It follows that treatment with phosphorus or sulphur in suita ble preparations, accordi ng to the nature of the disturbance, can be beneficial. If we study the functional properties of such substances we see that they can teach us a rational understanding of therapeutic prac tices, which otherwise must remain mere results of trial and error. The same app lies to phosphorus and sulphur treatment in cases where in the functionally 'dry' bone system or in the functionally 'moist' metabolic system of the organism the wrong quality predominates. If the bones remain too 'moist' there is a tendency to ri ckets; against this, certain fish-oils are a well-known remedy on account of their highl y phosphoric nature. Conversely, the application of sulphur can help where w eakness of the metabolic forces produces rheumatic or gouty sediments in parts of th e body whose function is to serve by their mobility the activities of the will. In th is case the abnormal predominance of the quality 'dry' can be counteracted by the medical application of sulphur. * Having observed the action of sulphur and phos phorus in the labor atory and in living organisms, we will now turn to phenomena of a macrotelluric nature which reveal the participation of sulphur and phosphorus. Ther e, sulphur points unmistakably to the earth's volcanism. It is a fact that, wherever mineral sulphur occurs in the earth, there we find a spot of former or present volcanic activity. Similarly, there is no such spot on the earth without su lphur being present in one form or another. Hence the name Solfatara for the fumarole described in Chapter IX. Once again it is the Solfatara which offers us a phenomenon, this time in connexion with the special role sulphur plays in its activities, which, regarded with the eye of the spirit, assumes the significance of an instance 'worth a thousand'. In spite of the very high temperature of the sulphurous fumes emitted from various crevices on the edge of the Solfatara, it is possible, thanks to the complete dryness of the fumes, to crawl a little way into the inte rior of these crevices. Not far away from the opening of the crevice, where the hot fu mes touch the cooler rock surface, one is met by a very beautiful spectacle - namely, the continual forming, out of nothing as it seems, of glittering yellow sulphur crystals , suspended in delicate chains from the ceiling. In this transformation of sul phurous substance from a higher material state, nearer to levity, to that of the solid crystal, we may behold an image of the generation of matter. For every physical substance and, therefore, every chemical element, exists originally as a pure function in the dynamic processes of the universe. Wherever, as a result of the action of gravit y, such a function congeals mate rially, there we meet it in the form of a physical-material substance. In the same sense, sulphur and phosphorus,"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" 159 in their real being, are pure functions, a nd where they occur as physical substances, there we meet these functions in their congealed state. One of the characteristics of the volcanic regi ons of the earth is the healing effect of substances found there. Fango-mud, for inst ance, which was mentioned in the last chapter, is a much-used remedy against rh eumatism. This is ty pical of functional sulphur. We may truly characterize the ear th's volcanism as being qualitatively sulphurous. It is the sulphur-function coming to expression through a higher degree of 'moistness' in the relationship between grav ity and levity which distinguishes volcanic regions from the rest of the otherwise 'dry' earth's crust. * To develop a corresponding picture of the f unction of phosphorus, we must try to find the macrotelluric sphere where this function operates similarly to that of sulphur in volcanism. From what has been said in the la st chapter it will be evident that we must look to the atmosphere, as the site of s now-formation. It is this process which we must now examine more closely. In the atmosphere, to begin with, we find water in a state of vapour, in which the influence of the terrestrial gravity-field is comparatively weak. Floating in this state, the vapour condenses and crys tallization proceeds. Obeyi ng the pull of gravity, more and more crystals unite in their descent and gradually form flakes of varying sizes. The nearer they come to earth, the closer they fall, until at last on the ground they form an unbroken, more or less spherical, cover. Imagine a snow-covered field glistening in th e sun on a clear, quiet winter's day. As far as we can see, there is no sign of life, no movement. Here water, which is normally fluid and, in its liquid state, serves the ever-changing life-processes, covers the earth in the form of millions of separate crystals shaped with mathematical exactitude, each of which breaks and reflects in a million rays the light from the sun (Plate V). A contrast, indeed, between this quiet emergence of forms from levity into gravity, and the form-denying volcanism surg ing up out of gravity into levity, as shown by the ever-res tless activity of the Solfatara. As we found volcanism to be a macrotelluric manifestation of functional su lphur, we find in the process of snow- formation a corresponding manifest ation of functional phosphorus. In the formation of snow, nature shows us in statu agendi a process which we otherwise meet in the earth only in its finished results, crystallization. We may, therefore, rightly look upon snow-formation as an ur-phenomenon in this sphere of nature's activities. As such it allows us to learn something con cerning the origin in general of the crystalline r ealm of the earth; and, vice ve rsa, our insi ght into the 'becoming' of this realm will enable us to see more clearly the universal function of which phosphorus is the main representati ve among the physical substances of the earth."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" 160 It has puzzled many an observer that crystals occur in the earth with directions of their main axes entirely independent of th e direction of the ea rthly pull of gravity. Plate VI shows the photograph of a cluster of Calcite crystals as an example of this phenomenon. It tells us that gravity can have no effect on the formation of the crystal itself. This riddle is solved by the phe nomenon of snow-formation provided we allow it to speak to us as an ur-phenomenon. For it then tells us that matter must be in a state of transition from lightne ss into heaviness if it is to appear in crystalline form. The crystals in the earth, therefore, must have originated at a time when the relation between levity and gravity on the earth was different from what it is, in this sphere, to-day. The same language is spoken by the prope rty of transparency which is so predominant among crystals. One of the funda mental characterist ics of heavy solid matter is to resist light - in other words, to be opaque. Exposed to heat, however, physical substance loses this feature to the extent that at the border of its ponderability all matter becomes pervious to light. Now, in the transparent crystal matter retains this kinship to light even in its solid state. A similar message comes from the, often so mysterious, colouri ng of the crystals. Here again nature offers us an instance whic h, 'worth a thousand', re veals a secret that would otherwise remain veiled. We refer to the pink crystals of tourmaline, whose colour comes from a small admixture of lith ium. This element, which belongs to the group of the alkaline metals, does not form coloured salts (a property only shown by the heavier metals). If exposed to a flame, however, it endo ws it with a definite colour which is the same as that of the lithium-co loured tourmaline. Read as a letter in nature's script, this fact te lls us that precious stones w ith their flame-like colours are characterized by having kept something of th e nature that was theirs before they coalesced into ponderable ex istence. In fact, they are 'frozen flames'. It is this fact, known from an cient intuitive experience, wh ich prompted man of old to attribute particular spiritual significance to the various preciou s stones of the earth and to use them correspondingly in his rituals. Crystallization, seen thus in its cosmic aspect, shows a dynamic orientation which is polarically opposite to that of the earth's se ismic activities. Just as in the latter we observe levity taking hold of ponderable ma tter and moving it in a direction opposite to the pull of gravity, so in crystallization we see imponderable matter passing over from levity into gravity. And just as we found in volcanism and related processes a field of activity of 'functional sulphur', so we found in snow-formation and related processes a field of activity of 'functional phosphorus'. Both fields are characterized by an interaction between grav ity and levity, this interact ion being of opposite nature in each of them. Here, again, sulphur and phosphor us appear as bearers of a polarity of the second order which springs from the two polarically opposite ways of interaction between the poles of the polarity of the first"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 161 order: levity-gravity. * As in man there is a third system, mediat ing between the two polar systems of his organism, so between sulphur and phosphorus there is a third element which in all its characteristics holds a middle place between them and is the bearer of a corresponding function. This element is carbon. To see this we need only take into c onsideration carbon's rela tionship to oxidation and reduction respectively. As it is natural for sulphur to be in the reduced state, and for phosphorus to be in the oxidized state, so it is in the nature of carbon to be related to both states and therefore to oscillate be tween them. By its readiness to change over from the oxidized to the reduced state, it can serve the plant in the assimilation of light, while by its readiness to make the re verse change it serves man and animal in the breathing process. We breathe in oxygen from the air; the oxygen circulates through the blood-stream and passes out agai n in conjunction with carbon, as carbon dioxide, when we exhale. In the process wh ereby the plants redu ce the carbon dioxide exhaled by man and animal, while the latter again absorb with their food the carbon produced in the form of organic matter by th e plant, we see carbon moving to and fro between the oxidized and the reduced conditions. Within the plant itself, too, carbon acts as functionary of the alternation between oxidation and reduction. During the first ha lf of the year, when vegetation is unfolding, there is a great reduction proce ss of oxidized carbon, while in the second half of the year, when the w ithering process prevails, a gr eat deal of the previously reduced carbon passes into the oxidized condi tion. As this is connected with exhaling and inhaling of oxygen through carbon, carbon ca n be regarded as having the function of the lung-organ of the earth. Logically enough, we find carbon playing the same role in the middle part of the threefold human organism. Another indication of the midway position of carbon is its ability to combine as readily with hydrogen as with oxygen, and, in these polar combinations, even to combine with itself. In this latter form it provides the basis of the innumerable organic substances in nature, and serves as the 'building stones' of the body- substances of living organisms. Amo ng these, the carbohydrates produced by the plants show clearly the doubl e function of carbon in the way it alternates between the states of starch and sugar."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 162 When the plant absorbs through its leaves ca rbonic acid from the air and condenses it into the multiple grains of starch with th eir peculiar structure characteristic for each plant species, we have a biological event wh ich corresponds to the formation of snow in the meteorological realm. Here we s ee carbon at work in a manner functionally akin to that of phosphorus. Sugar, on the other hand, has its place in the saps of the plants which rise through the stems and carry up with them the mineral substances of the earth. Here we find carbon acting in a way akin to the function of sulphur. This twofold nature of carbon makes itself noticeable down to the very mineral sphere of the earth. There we find it in the f act that carbon occurs both in the form of the diamond, the hardest of all mineral substan ces, and also in the form of the softest, graphite. Here also, in the diamond's br illiant transparency, and in the dense blackness of graphite, carbon reveal s its twofold relation to light. In Fig. 6 an attempt has been made to re present diagrammatically the function of Carbon in a way corresponding to the previous representation of the functions of Sulphur and Phosphorus. *"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 163 By adding carbon to our observations on the polarity of sulphur and phosphorus we have been led to a triad of functions each of which expresses a specific interplay of levity and gravity. That we encounter th ree such functions is not accidental or arbitrary. Rather is it based on the fact that the interacti on of forces emanating from a polarity of the first order, produces a pol arity of the second order, whose poles establish between them a sphere of balance. Through our study of levity and gravity in the matter-processe s of the earth, a perspective thus opens up into a structural principle of nature wh ich is actually not new to us. We encountered it at the very beginning of this book when we discussed the threefold psycho-physica l order of man's being. In the days of an older intu itive nature-wisdom man knew of a basic triad of functions as well as he knew of the four elementary qua lities. We hear a last echo of this in the Middle Ages, when people striving for a deep er understanding of na ture spoke of the trinity of Salt, Mercury and Sulphur. What the true alchemists, as these seekers of knowledge called themselves, meant by this wa s precisely the same as the conception we have here reached through our own way of studying matter ('Salt' standing for 'functional phosphorus', 'Mercury' for 'functional carbon'). Only the alchemist's way was a different one. This is not the place to enter into a full examination of the meaning and value of alchemy in its original legitimate sense (whi ch must not be confused with activities that later on paraded under the same name). Only this we will say - that genuine alchemy owes its origin to an impulse which, at a time when the onlooker- consciousness first arose, led to the foundati on of a school for the development of an intuitive relationship of the s oul with the world of the sens es. This was to enable man to resist the effects of the division which evolution was about to set up in his soul-life - the division which was to give him, on the one hand, an abstract experience of his own self, divorced from the outer wo rld, and on the other a mere onlooker's experience of that outer world. As a result of these endeavours, concepts were formed which in their literal meaning seemed to apply merely to outwardly perceptible substances, while in truth they stood for the spiritual functions represented by those substances, both within and outside the human organism. Thus the alchemist who used these concepts thought of them first as referring to his own soul, and to the inner organic processe s corresponding to the va rious activities of his soul. When speaking of Salt he meant the regulated formative activity of his thinking, based on the salt-forming process in his nervous system. When he spoke of Mercury he meant the quickly changing emotional life of the soul and the corresponding activities of the rhythmic processes of the body. Lastly, Sulphur meant the will activities of his soul and the corresponding metabolic processes of the body. Only through studying these f unctions within himself, a nd through re-establishing the harmony between them which had been theirs in the beginning, and from which, he felt, man had deviated in the course of tim e, did the alchemist hope to come to an understanding of their counterpa rts in the external cosmos."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 164 Older alchemical writings, therefore, can be understood only if prescriptions which seem to signify certain chemical manipulati ons are read as instructions for certain exercises of the soul, or as advices for the redirection of corresponding processes in the body. For instance, if an alchemist gave directions for a certain treatment of Sulphur, Mercury and Salt, w ith the assertion that by ca rrying out these directions properly, one would obtain Aurum (gold), he really spoke of a method to direct the thinking, feeling and willing act ivities of the soul in such a way as to gain true Wisdom. 1 * As in the case of the concepts constituting the doctrine of the f our elements, we have represented here the basic alchemical con cepts not only because of their historical significance, but because, as ingredients of a still functional conception of nature, they assume new significance in a scien ce which seeks to develop, though from different starting-points, a similar conception. As will be seen in our further studies, these concepts prove a welcome enrichment of the language in which we must try to express our readings in nature. 1 Roger Bacon in the thirteenth, and Berthold Schwartz in the fourteenth century, are reputed to have carried out experiments by mixing physical salt (in the form of the chemically labile saltpetre) with physical sulphur and - after some initial attempts with various metals - with charcoal, and then exposing the mixture to the heat of physical fire. The outcome of this purely materialistic interpretation of the three alchemical concepts was not the acqui sition of wisdom, or, as Schwartz certainly had hoped, of gold, but of ... gunpowder!"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 165 CHAPTER XII Space and Counter-Space With the introduction, in Chapter X, of th e peripheral type of force-field which appertains to levity as the usual centra l one does to gravity, we are compelled to revise our conception of space. For in a space of a kind we are accustomed to conceive, that is, the three-di mensional, Euclidean space, the existence of such a field with its characteristic of increasing in strength in the outward direction is a paradox, contrary to mathematical logic. This task, which in view of our further observations of the ac tions of the levity- gravity polarity in nature we must now tackle, is, however, by no means insoluble. For in modern mathematics thought-forms are already present which make it possible to develop a space-concept ade quate to levity. As referre d to in Chapter I, it was Rudolf Steiner who first pointed to the significance in this respect of the branch of modern mathematics known as Projective Geometry. He showed that Projective Geometry, if rightly used, carries over the mind from the customary abstract to a new concrete treatment of mathematical con cepts. The following example will serve to explain, to start with, what we mean by sa ying that mathematics has hitherto been used abstractly. One of the reasons why the world-picture developed by Einstein in his Theory of Relativity deserves to be acknowledged as a step forward in comparison with the picture drawn by classical physics, lies in the fact that the old conception of three- dimensional space as a kind of 'cosmic cont ainer', extending in all directions into infinity and filled, as it were, with the conten t of the physical universe, is replaced by a conception in which the structure of space results from the laws interrelating this content. Our further discussion will show th at this indeed is the way along which, to- day, mathematical thought must move in order to cope with universal reality. However, for reasons discussed earlier, Einste in was forced to conceive all events in the universe after the model of gravity as observable on the earth. In this way he arrived at a space-structure which possesses neither the three-dimensionality nor the rectilinear character of so -called Euclidean space - a space-picture which, though mathematically consistent, is incompre hensible by the human mind. For nothing exists in our mind that could enable us to experience as a reality a space-time continuum of three dimensions which is curved within a further dimension. This outcome of Einstein's endeavours results from the fact that he tried by means of gravity-bound thought to comprehend universal happenings of which the true causes are non-gravitational. A thinki ng that has learnt to ac knowledge the existence of levity must indeed pursue precisely the opposite direction. Instead of freezing time"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" 166 down into spatial dimension, in order to ma ke it fit into a worl d ruled by nothing but gravity, we must develop a conception of sp ace sufficiently fluid to let true time have its place therein. We shall see how such a pr ocedure will lead us to a space-concept thoroughly conceivable by hu man common sense, provided we are prepared to overcome the onlooker-standpoint in mathematics also. Einstein owed the possibility of esta blishing his space-picture to a certain achievement of mathematical thinking in m odern times. As we have seen, one of the peculiarities of the onlooker-consciousne ss consists in its being devoid of all connexion with reality. The process of thi nking thereby gained a degree of freedom which did not exist in former ages. In cons equence, mathematicians were enabled in the course of the nineteenth century to c onceive the most varied space-systems which were all mathematically consistent and yet la cked all relation to external existence. A considerable number of space-systems ha ve thus become established among which there is the system that served Einstein to derive his space-time concept. Some of them have been more or less fully worked out, while in certain instances all that has been done is to show that they are mathematically conceivable. Among these there is one which in all its character istics is polarically opposite to the Euclidean system, and which is destined for this reason to become the space-system of levity. It is symptomatic of the remoteness from realit y of mathematical thinking in the onlooker- age that precisely this system has so far received no special attention. 1 For the purpose of this book it is not n ecessary to expound in detail why modern mathematical thinking has been led to l ook for thought-forms ot her than those of classical geometry. It is enough to remark th at for quite a long time there had been an awareness of the fact that the consistency of Euclid's definitions and proofs fails as soon as one has no longer to do with finite geometrical entities, but with figures which extend into infinity, as for instance wh en the properties of pa rallel straight lines come into question. For the concept of infi nity was foreign to classical geometrical thinking. Problems of the kind which had de feated Euclidean thinking became soluble directly human thinking was able to handle the concept of infinity. We shall now indicate some of the lines of geometrical thought which follow from this. * Let us consider a straight lin e extending without limits in either direction. Projective geometry is able to state that a point m oving along this line in one direction will eventually return from the other. To see this, we imagine two straight lines a and b intersecting at P. One of these lines is fixed (a); the other (b) rotates uniformly about C. Fig. 7 indicates the rotation of b by showing it in a number of"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 167 positions with the respective positions of its point of intersection with a (P 1 , P 2 . . .). We observe this point moving along a, as a result of the rotation of b, until, when both lines are parallel, it r eaches infinity. As a result of the continued rotation of b, however, P does not remain in infinity, but returns along a from the other side. We find here two forms of movement linked toge ther - the rotational movement of a line (b) on a point (C), and the progressive moveme nt of a point (P) along a line (a). The first movement is continuous, and obser vable throughout within finite space. Therefore the second movement must be c ontinuous as well, ev en though it partly escapes our observation. Hence, when P disa ppears into infinity on one side of our own point of observation, it is at the same time in infinity on the other side. In order words, an unlimited straight line has only one point at infinity. It is clear that, in order to become familiar with this aspect of geometry, one must grow together in inward activity with the happening which is contained in the above description. What we therefore intend by gi ving such a description is to provide an opportunity for a particular me ntal exercise, just as wh en we introduced Goethe's botany by describing a number of successive le af-formations. Here, as much as there, it is the act of 're-creating' that matters. The following exercise will help us towards further clarity concerning the nature of geometrical infinity. We imagine ourselves in the centre of a s phere which we allow to expand uniformly on all sides. Whilst the inner wall of this s phere withdraws from us into ever greater distances, it grows flatter and flatter until, on reaching infinite distance, it turns into a plane. We thus find ourselves surrounded everywhere by a surface which, in the strict mathematical sense, is a plane, and is ye t one and the same surface on all sides. This leads us to the conception of the plane at infinity as a self-con tained entity although it expands infinitely in all directions. This property of a plane at infinity, however, is really a property of any plane. To realize this, we must widen our conception of infinity by freeing it from a certain one- sidedness still connected with it. This we do by transferring ourselves into the infinite"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" 168 plane and envisaging, not the plane from the poi nt, but the point from the plane. This operation, however, implies something whic h is not obvious to a mind accustomed to the ordinary ways of mathematical re asoning. It therefore requires special explanation. In the sense of Euclidean geometry, a plan e is the sum-total of innumerable single points. To take up a position in a plane, th erefore, means to imagine oneself at one point of the plane, with the latter extending around in all di rections to infinity. Hence the journey from any point in space to a pl ane is along a straight line from one point to another. In the case of the plane being at infinity, it would be a journey along a radius of the infinitely large sphere from its centre to a point at its circumference. In projective geometry the operation is of a different character. Just as we arrived at the infinitely large sphere by letting a fin ite sphere grow, so must we consider any finite sphere as having grown from a sphere with infinitely small extension; that is, from a point. To travel from the point to th e infinitely distant plane in the sense of projective geometry, therefore, means that we have first to identif y ourselves with the point and 'become' the plane by a process of uniform expansion in all directions. As a result of this we do not arrive at one point in the plane, with the latter extending round us on all sides, but we are present in the plane as a whole everywhere. No point in it can be characterized as having any dist ance, whether finite or infinite, from us. Nor is there any sense in speaking of the pl ane itself as being at infinity. For any plane will allow us to identify ourselves w ith it in this way. And any such plane can be given the character of a plane at infinity by relating it to a point infinitely far away from it (i.e. from us). Having thus dropped the one-sided conception of infinity, we must look for another characterization of the relationship between a point and a plane which are infinitely distant from one another. This requires, first of all, a pr oper characterization of Point and Plane in themselves. Conceived dynamically, as projective geomet ry requires, Point and Plane represent a pair of opposites, the Point standing for ut most contraction, the Plane for utmost expansion. As such, they form a polarity of the first order. Both together constitute Space. Which sort of space this is, depends on the relationship in which they are envisaged. By positing the point as the unit from which to start, and deriving our conception of the plane from the point, we constitute Euclidean space. By starting in the manner described above, with the plane as the unit, and concei ving the point from it, we constitute polar-Euclidean space. The realization of the reversibility of th e relationship between Point and Plane leads to a conception of Space still free from any specific character. By G. Adams this space has been appositely called archetypal space, or ur-space. Both Euclidean and polar-Euclidean space are particular manifest ations of it, their mutual relationship being one of metamorphosis in the Goethean sense."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 169 Through conceiving Euclidean and polar-Euclidean space in this manner it becomes clear that they are nothing else than th e geometrical expression of the relationship between gravity and levity. For gravity, th rough its field spreading outward from an inner centre, establishes a point-to-point relation between all th ings under its sway; whereas levity draws all things within its domain into common plane-relations by establishing field-conditions wherein acti on takes place from the periphery towards the centre. What distinguishes in both cases the plane at infinity from all other planes may be best described by calling it the all-embracing plane ; correspondingly the point at infinity may be best described as the all-relating point. In outer nature the all-embracing plane is as much the 'centre' of the earth's field of levity as the all-relating point is the centr e of her field of gravity. All actions of dynamic entities, such as that of the ur-plant and its subordinate types, start from this plane. Seeds, eye-formations, etc., are nothing but individual al l-relating points in respect of this plane. All th at springs from such points does so because of the point's relation to the all-embracing plane. This may suffice to show how realistic are the mathematical concepts which we have here tried to build up. * When we set out earlier in this book (Chapt er VIII) to discover the source of Galileo's intuition, by which he had been enabled to find the theorem of the parallelogram of forces, we were led to certain experi ences through which all men go in early childhood by erecting their body and learning to walk. We were thereby led to realize that man's general capacity for thinking mathematically is the outcome of early experiences of this kind. It is evident that geometrical c oncepts arising in man's mind in this way must be those of Euclidean ge ometry. For they are acquired by the will's struggle with gravity. The dynamic law discovered in this way by Galileo was therefore bound to apply to the behaviour of mechanical forces - that is, of forces acting from points outward. In a similar way we can now seek to find the source of our capacity to form polar- Euclidean concepts. As we were formerly led to experiences of man's early life on earth, so we are now led to his embr yonic and even pre-embryonic existence. Before man's supersensible part enters into a physical body th ere is no means of conveying to it experiences other than those of levity, and this condition prevails right through embryonic development. For while the body floats in the mother's foetal fluid it is virtually exempt from the influe nce of the earth's field of gravity. History has given us a source of informa tion from these early periods of man's existence in Traherne's recoll ections of the time when his so ul was still in the state of cosmic consciousness. Among his descriptions we may therefore expect to find a picture of levity-space which will confir m through immediate experience what we have arrived at along the lines of real istic mathematical reasoning. Among poems"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" 170 quoted earlier, his The Praeparative and My Spirit do indeed convey this picture in the clearest possible way.

In the first we read: 'Then was my Soul my only All to me, A living endless Ey, Scarce bounded with the Sky Whose Power, and Act, and Essence was to see: I was an inward Sphere of Light, Or an interminable Orb of Sight, Exceeding that which makes the Days . . .' In the second poem the same experience is expressed in richer detail. There he says of his own soul that it - ... being Simple, like the Deity, In its own Centre is a Sphere, Not limited but everywhere. It acts not from a Centre to Its Object, as remote; But present is, where it doth go To view the Being it doth note ... A strange extended Orb of Joy Proceeding from within, Which did on ev'ry side display Its force; and being nigh of Kin To God, did ev'ry way Dilate its Self ev'n instantaneously, Yet an Indivisible Centre stay, In it surrounding all Eternity. 'Twas not a Sphere; Yet did appear One infinite: 'Twas somewhat everywhere.' Observe the distinct descript ion of how the relation between circumference and centre is inverted by the former becoming itself an 'indivisible centre'. In a space of this kind there is no Here and There, as in Euclidean space, for the consciousness is always and immediately at one with the whole space. Mo tion is thus quite di fferent from what it is in Euclidean space. Traherne himself italicized the word 'instantaneous', so important did he find this fact. (The quali ty of instantaneousness - equal from the physical point of view to a velocity of the value âž - will occupy us more closely as a characteristic of the realm of levity when we come to discuss the apparent velocity of light in connexion with our optical studies.)"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" 171 By thus realizing the source in man of th e polar-Euclidean thought-forms, we see the discovery of projective geometry in a new light. For it now assumes the significance of yet another historical sy mptom of the modern re-awake ning of man's capacity to remember his prenatal existence. We know from our previous studies that th e concept of polarity is not exhausted by conceiving the world as being constituted by polarities of one order only. Besides primary polarities, there are secondary ones, the outcome of interaction between the primary poles. Having conceived of Point a nd Plane as a geometrical polarity of the first order, we have therefore to ask what formative elements there are in geometry which represent the corresponding polarity of the second order. The following considerations will show that these are the radius, which arises from the point becoming related to the plane, and the spheri cally bent surface (for which we have no other name than that again of the sphere), arising from the plane becoming related to the point. In Euclidean geometry the sphere is defi ned as 'the locus of all points which are equidistant from a given point'. To define the sphere in this way is in accord with our post-natal, gravity-bound consciousness. Fo r in this state our mind can do no more than envisage the surface of the sphere point by point from its centre and recognize the equal distance of all these points from th e centre. Seen thus, the sphere arises as the sum-total of the end-point s of all the straight lines of equal length which emerge from the centre-point in all directions. Fi g. 8 indicates this schematically. Here the radius, a straight line, is cl early the determining factor. We now move to the other pole of the primary polarity, that is to the plane, and let the sphere arise by imagining the plane approaching an infini tely distant point evenly from all sides. We view the process realis tically only by imagining ourselves in the plane, so that we surround the point from all sides, with the distance between us and "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" 172 the point diminishing gradually. Since we remain all the time on the surface, we have no reason to conceive any change in its origin al position; that is, we continue to think of it as an all-embracing plane w ith regard to the chosen point. The only way of representing the sphere di agrammatically, as a unit bearing in itself the character of the plane whence it sprang, is as shown in Fig. 9, where a number of planes, functioning as tangential planes, are so related that together they form a surface which possesses everywhere the same distance from the all-relating point. Since Point and Plane represent in the real m of geometrical concepts what in outer nature we find in the form of the gravity -levity polarity, we may expect to meet Radius and Sphere as actual formative elemen ts in nature, wherever gravity and levity interact in one way or another. A few obser vations may suffice to give the necessary evidence. Further confirmation will be furnished by the ensuing chapters. The Radius-Sphere antithesis appears mo st obviously in the human body, the radial element being represented by the limbs, the spherical by the skull. The limbs thus become the hieroglyph of a dynamic directed from the Point to the Plane, and the skull of the opposite. This indeed is in accord with the distribution in the organism of the sulphur-salt polarity, as we learnt from our physiological and psychological studies. Inner processes and outer form thus reveal the same distribution of poles. In the plant the same polarity appears in st alk and leaf. Obviously the stalk represents the radial pole. The connexion between leaf and sphere is not so clear: in order to recognize it we must appreciat e that the single plant is not a self-contained entity to the same degree as is the human being. The e quivalent of the single man is the entire vegetable covering of the earth. In man ther e is an individual centre round which the bones of his skull are curved; in the plant world the equivalent is the centre of the earth. It is in relation to this that we must conceive of the single leaves as parts of a greater sphere. In the plant, just as in man, the morphol ogical polarity coincides with the biological. There is, on the one hand, the process of assimilation (photosynthesis), so characteristic of the leaf. Through this pr ocess matter passes over from the aeriform condition into that of numerous separate, ch aracteristically structured solid bodies - the starch grains. Besides this kind of a ssimilation we have learnt to recognize a higher form which we called 'spiritual assi milation'. Here, a transition of substance from the domain of levity to that of gravit y takes place even more strikingly than in ordinary (physical) as similation (Chapter X). The corresponding process in the linear stalk is one which we may call 'sublimation' - again with its extension into 'spiritual sublimation'. Through this process matter is carried in the upward direction towards ever less ponderable conditions, and finally into the formless state of pure 'chaos'. By th is means the seed is prepared (as we have seen) with the help of the fire-bearing po llen, so that after it has fallen to the ground,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" 173 it may serve as an all-relating point to whic h the plant's Type can direct its activity from the universal circumference. In order to find the corresponding morphologi cal polarity in the animal kingdom, we must realize that the animal, by having the main axis of its body in the horizontal direction, has a relationship to the gravity-levity fields of the earth different from those of both man and plant. As a result, the single animal body shows the sphere- radius polarity much less sharply. If we compare the different groups of the animal kingdom, however, we find that the animals, too, bear this polarity as a formative element. The birds represent the spherical (d ry, saline) pole; the ruminants the linear (moist, sulphurous) pole. The carnivorous quadrupeds form the intermediary (mercurial) group. As ur-phenomenal types we may name among the birds the eagle, clothed in its dry, silicic pl umage, hovering with far-spread wings in the heights of the atmosphere, united with the expanses of space through its far-reaching sight; among the ruminants, the cow, lying heav ily on the ground of the earth, given over entirely to the immensely elaborated sulphurous pro cess of its own digestion. Between them comes the lion - the most ch aracteristic animal for the preponderance of heart-and-lung activities in the body, with all the attr ibutes resulting from that. Within the scope of this book it can only be intimated briefly, but should not be left unmentioned for the sake of those interest ed in a further pursuit of these lines of thought, that the morphological mean between radius and sphere (corresponding to Mercurius in the alchemical triad) is represented by a ge ometrical figure known as the 'lemniscate', a particular modificatio n of the so-called Cassinian curves. 2 1 For further details, see the writin gs of G. Adams and L. Locher-E rnst who, each in his own way, have made a beginning with applying projective geometry on the lines indicated by Rudolf Steiner. Professor Locher-Ernst was the first to apply the term 'polar-Euclidean' to the space-system corresponding to levity. 2 For particulars of the lemniscate as the building plan of the middle part of man's skeleton, see K. KÃ¶nig, M.D.: Beitrage zu einer reinen Anatomic des menschlichen Knochenskeletts in the periodical Natura (Dornach, 1930-1). Some projective-geometrical considerations concerning the lemniscate are to be found in the previously mentioned writings of G. Adams and L. Locher-Ernst."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 174 CHAPTER XIII 'Radiant Matter' When man in the state of world-onlooker undertook to form a dynamic picture of the nature of matter, it was inevita ble that of all the qualities which belong to its existence he should be able to envisage only those pe rtaining to gravity a nd electricity. Because his consciousness, at this stage of its evolution, was cl osely bound up with the force of gravity inherent in the human body, he wa s unable to form any conception of levity as a force opposite to gravity. Yet, nature is built bipolarically, and polarity-concepts are therefore indispensable for developing a true understanding of her actions. This accounts for the fact that the unipolar con cept of gravity had eventually to be supplemented by some kind of bipolar concept. Now, the only sphere of nature-phenomena with a bipolar charac ter accessible to the onlooker-consciousness 'was that of electricity. It was thus that man in this state of consciousness was compelled to picture th e foundation of the physical universe as being made up of gravity and electricity, as we meet them in the modern picture of the atom, with its heavy elec tro-positive nucleus and the virtually weightless electro- negative electrons moving round it. Once scientific observation and thought ar e freed from the limitations of the onlooker-consciousness, both gravity and elec tricity appear in a new perspective, though the change is different for each of them. Gravity, while it becomes one pole of a polarity, with levity as the opposite pole, st ill retains its character as a fundamental force of the physical universe, the gravity-levity polarity being one of the first order. Not so electricity. For, as the following discussion will show, the electrical polarity is one of the second order; moreover, inst ead of constituting matter as is usually believed, electricity turns out to be in reality a product of matter. * We follow Goethe's line when, in order to answer the question, 'W hat is electricity?' we first ask, 'How does electricity aris e?' Instead of starting with phenomena produced by electricity when it is alr eady in action, and deriving from them a hypothetical picture, we begi n by observing the processes to which electricity owes its appearance. Since there is significance in the historical order in which facts of nature have come to man's knowledge in the past, we choose as our starting-point, among the various modes of generating electricity, the one through which the existence of an electric for ce first became known. This is the rousing of the electric state in a body by rubbing it with anothe r body of different material composition. Originally, amber was rubbed with wool or fur."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" 175 By picturing this process in our mind we become aware of a certain kinship of electricity with fire, since for ages th e only known way of kindling fire was through friction. We notice that in both cases man had to resort to the w ill-power invested in his limbs for setting in motion two pieces of matter, so that, by overcoming their resistance to this motion, he released from them a certain force which he could utilize as a supplement to his own will. The similari ty of the two processes may be taken as a sign that heat and electricity are related to each other in a certain way, the one being in some sense a metamorphosis of the other. Ou r first task, therefore, will be to try to understand how it is that friction causes heat to appear in manifest form. There is no friction unless the surfaces of the rubbed bodies have a st ructure that is in some way interfered with by the rubbing, wh ile at the same time they offer a certain resistance to the disturbance. This resistance is due to a characteristic of matter, commonly called cohesion. Now we know that the inner coherence of a physical body is due to its point-relationship, that is to the gravitational force bound up with it. Indeed, cohesion increases as we pass fr om the gaseous, through the liquid, to the solid state of matter. Whilst a body's cohesion is due to gravity, its spatial extendedne ss is, as we have seen, due to levity. If we reduce the volume of a piece of physical matter by means of pressure, we therefore release levity-forces previously bound up in it, and these, as always happens in such cases, appear in the form of free heat. Figuratively speaking, we may say that by applying pressure to matte r, latent levity is pressed out of it, somewhat like water out of a wet sponge. The generation of free heat by friction rests on quite similar grounds. Obviously, friction always requires a certain pressu re. This alone, however, would not account for the amount of heat easily produced by frictio n. To the pressure there is in this case added a certain measure of encroachment upon the unity of the material substance. In the case of friction between two solid bodies, this may go so far that particles of matter are completely detached from the cohesive whole. The result is an increase in the number of single mass-centres on the earth, as against the all-embracing cosmic periphery. This diminishes the hold of le vity on the total amount of physical matter present on the earth. Again, the levity thus becoming free appears as external heat. (In the reverse case when, for instance th rough melting, a number of single physical bodies become one, free heat becomes latent.) Both the diminishing of spatial extension and the breaking up of a whole into parts entail an increase in the quality 'dry'. This applies not only in the sense that the parts which have become independent units are 'd ry' in relation to e ach other - formerly coherent matter being turned in to dust - but also in the ot her sense, and one valid in both cases, that levity and gravity are losing part of their previ ous inter-connexion. If this twofold process of 'becoming dry' reaches a certain intensity, the substances concerned, provided they are inflammable, be gin to burn, with the result that dry heat escapes and dry ash is formed. We note th at in each case we are dealing with a change in the relationship between the pol es of a polarity of the first order."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 176 We will now apply this picture of the pro cess of friction to the instance when, as a result of this action, electricity appears. Originally the evoking of the electric conditi on was ascribed solely to the nature of amber, the only substance known to possess this property. To-day we know that not the amber alone, but its coming together with another substance of different nature, in this instance an animal substance of the na ture of hair or sil k, is required. Whatever substances we use for friction, they must always be different in nature, so as to allow both kinds of electricity to appear at once. Which of the two kinds imposes its presence the more strongly upon the observer depends on purely extraneous conditions which have nothing to do with the process itself. Obviously, if we wish to understand the qua litative difference be tween the two kinds of electricity, we must investigate the qualitative difference in the material substances, which give rise to electricity when they are rubbed together. We shall again follow the historical line by examin ing the two substances which first taught man the polar nature of electricity. They are glass and resin, after which, as we mentioned, the two electricities we re even named in the beginning. Our functional conception of ma tter, developed earlier (Cha pter XI), allows us to recognize in these two substan ces representatives of the Salt-Sulphur polarity. Indeed, glass as a mineral substance, which actual ly owes its specific character to the presence of silicon in it, clearly stands on the phosphoric-crystalline side, while resin, being itself a sort of 'gum', on the sulphur ous-volcanic side. In fact, sulphur itself was soon found to be a particularly suitable substance for producing 'resin'-electricity. Now the usual way of producing one kind of electricity is by rubbing resin (or sulphur, or ebonite) with wool or fur, and the other by rubbi ng glass with leather. At first sight, it does not seem as if the two counter-substances represent the required alchemic counter-poles to resin and glass. For both hair and leather are animal products and therefore seem to be of lik e nature. Closer inspection, however, shows that they do obey the rule. For hair, like al l horny substances, is a dead product of external secretion by the anim al organism. An ur-phenomenal example of it, showing its kinship to glass-like substances, is the transparent cornea of the eye, close to the crystal-lens. Leather, on the other hand, is a product of the hypodermic part of the body and, as such, belongs to those parts of the organism which are filled with blood, and, therefore, permeated with life. (Note as a characteristic of leat her that it requires a special treatment, tanning, to make it as im mune from decay as hair is by nature.) Hair and leather, therefore, represent in themselves a salt-sulphur polarity, and thus fulfil the corresponding function when br ought together with resin or glass respectively. What is true for the particular substances which originally le d man to discover the dual nature of electricity, hol ds good equally for any pair of substances capable of assuming the electric state when rubbed ag ainst each other. If we examine from this point of view the series of such substa nces, as usually given in the textbooks on"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" 177 electricity, we shall always find a substan ce of extreme salt-character at the one end, and one of extreme sulphur-character at the other, the substances as a whole forming a gradual transition from one extreme to th e other. Which kind of electricity appears on each, when submitted to friction, depends on whether the counter-substance stands on its right or left, in the se ries. It is the particular relation between the two which makes them behave in one way or the other. There are cases which seem to elude this la w, and investigation has shown that other characteristics of the rubbed bodies, such as surface quality, can have a modifying influence. For lack of a guiding idea they are treated in the textbooks as 'irregularities'. Observation led by a true pol arity concept shows that in these cases also the rule is not violated. In this re spect, interesting information can be gained from the observations of J. W. Ritter (1776-1810), an ingenious Naturphilosoph from the circle round Goethe, but to whom, als o, physical science is indebted for his discovery of the ultra-violet part of th e spectrum and of galvanic polarization. Among his writings there is a treatise on el ectricity, giving ma ny generally unknown instances of frictional electricity which are in good accord with our picture and well worth investigating. According to Ritter, even two crystalline substances of different hardness, such as Calcite a nd quartz, become electric when rubbed together, the softer playing the part of 'resin' a nd the harder that of 'glass'. These few facts connected with the genera tion of frictional elect ricity are enough to allow us to form a picture of the nature of the polarity represented by the two kinds of electricity. We remember that in the case of the generati on of heat through fric tion, as a result of an encroachment upon the cohesion of the material body involved, the relationship between levity and gravity in it changes from 'moist' to 'dry' and that the effect of this is the appearance of 'fire' and 'dust' as poles of a primary polarity. This process, however, is altered when the bodies subjecte d to friction are opposed to each other in the sense of a salt-sulphur polarity. The effect then is that the liberated levity, under the influence of the peculiar tension be tween the two bodies, remains bound in the realm of substance and becomes itself split up polarically. Clearly, then, in the case of electrica l polarity we encounter a certain form of gravity- bound levity, and this in a twofold way. Owing to the contrasting nature of the two bodies involved in the process, the coupli ng of gravity and lev ity is a polar one on both sides. The electrical pol arity thus turns out to be itself of the nature of a secondary polarity. Two more recently discovered means of e voking the electric condition in a piece of matter confirm this picture. They are the so-called piezo-electricity and pyro- electricity. Both signify the o ccurrence of the electrical polar ity at the two ends of an asymmetrically built (hemimorphous) crystal, as the result of changing the crystal's spatial condition. In piezo-electricity the change consists in a diminution of the crystal's volume through pressure; in pyro-el ectricity, in an incr ease of the crystal"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 178 volume by raising its temperature. The asymme try of the crystal, due to a one-sided working of the forces of crystallization, play s the same role here as does the alchemic opposition between the two bodies used for the production of frictional electricity. * It is typical of the scient ist of the past that he wa s dependent on phenomena brought about by a highly developed e xperimental technique for becoming aware of certain properties of the electrical force, whereas for the realistic observer these properties are revealed at once by the most prim itive electric phenomena. We remember Eddington's description of th e positron as 'negative material', and his subsequent remarks, which show the paradoxical nature of this concept if applied to the hypothetical interior of the atom (Chapt er IV). The quite primitive phenomenon of electrical repulsion and attract ion shows us the same thing in a manner of which it is not difficult to form a conception. Modern physics itself, with the help of Faraday's fiel d-concept, describes these phenomena as caused by pressure - resulting from the meeting in space of two similar electrical fields - and sucti on - resulting from the meeting of two dissimilar fields. In the first case the space between the two el ectrically charged bodies assumes a degree of density, as if it were filled with some elastic material. In the second instance the density of the space where the two fields intermingle is lower than that of its surroundings. Here, clearly, we have a st ate of negative density which acts on the electrically charged bodies just as a loweri ng of pressure acts on a gas: in both cases movement occurs in the direction leadi ng from the higher to the lower density. Electricity thus shows itself capable of producing both gr avity and levity effects, thereby once more confirming our picture of it. * Our next task will be to examine the galvan ic form of generating electricity, in order to gain further light on our pi cture of the electrical polarity. Galvanism, as it became established through Volta's work, rests on certain properties of the metallic substances of the earth. Compared with the substances which may be used for producing electricity through fr iction, the metals hold a mid-position. They are all essentially mercurial substances. (In quicksilver, which for this reason was given the name 'mercury' by the alchemists , this fact comes to an ur-phenomenal appearance.) Among the many facts proving the mercurial nature of the metals, there is one of particular interest to us. This is their peculiar relationship to the processes of oxidation and reduction. Metals, in their metallic state, are bearers of latent levity, which can be set free either through combustion or through corrosion. They differ from one another by their relative degree of eagerness to enter into a nd remain in the metallic, that is, the reduced state, or to assume and keep the state of the oxide (in which form they are"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" 179 found in the various metallic oxides and salts) . There are metals such as gold, silver, etc., for which the reduced state is more or less natural; others, such as potassium, sodium, etc., find the oxidized state natural and can be brought into and kept in the reduced state only by artificial means. Betw een these extremes there are all possible degrees of transition, some metals more ne arly resembling the 'noble', others more nearly the 'corrosive', metals. We remember that it was the different relationship of sulphur and phosphorus to reduction and oxidation which led us to envisage them as ur-phenomenal representatives of the alchemic polarity. We may therefore say that there are metals which from the alchemic point of view mo re nearly resemble sulphur, others more nearly phosphorus, whilst others again hold an intermediary position between the extremes. It is on these differences among the various metals that their galvanic properties are based. Let us from this point of view contemplat e the following series of chemical elements, which is a representation of the so-called voltaic series: Graphite, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Tin, Lead, Zinc, Aluminium, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium. Any two of these metals consti tute a voltaic cell. Its electr omotive force is determined by the distance in the series between the metals used. Just as in th e case of frictional electricity, the kind of electricity which is supplied by a certain metal depends on whether the other metal with which it is couple d stands to the right or to the left of it in the series. 1 Let us now see what happens in a galvanic cell when the two different metals are simultaneously exposed to the chemical ac tion of the connecting fluid. Each metal by itself would undergo oxidation with greater or less intensity, and the calorific energy hidden in it would become free in the form of heat. This process suffers a certain alteration through the presen ce of the second metal, wh ich sets up an alchemic tension between the two. Instead of a proper segregation of the primary polarity, heat- dust (in this case, heat-oxide), the he at remains matter-bound and appears on the surface of the two metals in a secondarily split form as positive and negative electricity. The similarity between this process and th e frictional generation of electricity is evident. * Our observations have shown that the emerge nce of the electric state, whether it be caused by friction or galvanically, depends on matter entering in to a condition in which its cohesion is loosened - or, as we al so put it, on its being turned into 'dust' - and this in such a way that the escapi ng levity remains dust-bound. This picture of"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 180 electricity now enables us to give a real istic interpretation of certain phenomena which, in the interpretation which the physicist of the past was bound to give them, have contributed much to the tighteni ng of the net of scientific illusion. Some sixty years after Dalton had established, purely hypothe tically, the theory of the atomistic structure of matter, scientific re search was led to the observation of actual atomistic phenomena. Crookes found electricity appearing in his tubes in the form of discrete particles, with pr operties hitherto known only as appertaining to mass. What could be more natural than to take this as evidence that the method of thought developed during the past era of science was on the right course? The same phenomena appear in quite a differe nt light when we view them against the background of the picture of electricity to which our obs ervations have led. Knowing that the appearance of electr icity depends on a process of atomization of some sort, we shall expect that where electricity becomes freely observable, it will yield phenomena of an atomistic kind. The obser vations of electrici ty in a vacuum, therefore, yield no confirmation whatsoev er of the atomistic view of matter. The same is true of the phenomena bound up with radioactivity, which were discovered in direct consequence of Cr ookes's work. We know that the naturally radioactive elements are all in the group of those with the highest atomic weight. This fact, seen together with the characteristic s of radioactivity, tells us that in such elements gravity has so far got the upper ha nd of levity that the physical substance is unable to persist as a spatially exte nded, coherent unit. It th erefore falls asunder, with the liberated levity drawn into the proce ss of dispersion. Seen thus, radioactivity becomes a symptom of the earth's old age. * Before entering into a discussion of the quest ion, which naturally arises at this point, as to how levity and gravity by their two po ssible ways of interaction - 'sulphurous' or 'saline' - determine the properties of so- called positive and negative electricity, we shall first study the third mode of genera ting electricity, namely, by electromagnetic induction. Along this way we shall arrive at a picture of the magnetic force which corresponds to the one already obt ained of electricity. This wi ll then lead us to a joint study of the nature of electric polarity and magnetic polarity. The discovery of the phenomena we call el ectromagnetic depended on the possibility of producing continuous electrical processes. This arose with Volta's invention. When it became necessary to find a concept for the process which takes pl ace in an electric conductor between the poles of a galvanic ce ll, the concept of the 'current', borrowed from hydrodynamics, suggested itself. Ever since then it has been the rule to speak of the existence of a current within an elect ric circuit; its strength or intensity is measured in terms of a unit named in honour of Ampere."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" 181 This concept of the current has had a fate typical of the whol e relation of human thought to the facts connected with electricity. Long after it had been coined to cover phenomena which in themselves betray no movement of any kind between the electrical poles, other phenomena which do in fact show such movements became known through Crookes's observations. Just as in the case of atomism, they seemed to prove the validity of the preconceived id ea of the current. Soon, however, radiant electricity showed properties which contra dicted the picture of something flowing from one pole to the other. The cathode ra ys, for instance, were found to shoot forth into space perpendicularly from the surf ace of the cathode, without regard to the position of the anode. At the same time Maxwell's hydrodynamic analogy (as our historical survey has shown) led to a view of the nature of electricity by which this very analogy was put out of court. By pr edicting certain proper ties of electricity which come to the fore when its poles altern ate rapidly, he seemed to bring electricity into close kinship with light. Mathematical treatment then made it necessary to regard the essential energy process as occurring, not from one pole to the other, but at right angles to a line joining th e poles (Poynting's vector). This picture, however, satisfactory though it was in the realm of high frequency, failed as a means of describing so-called direct-current processes. As a result of all this the theory of electricity has fallen apart into several conceptual realms lying, as it were, alongside one anothe r, each consistent in itself but lacking any logical connexion with the others. Although the old concept of the electric current has long lost its validity, scie ntific thought (not to speak of the layman's) has not managed to discard it. To do this must therefor e be our first task, if we want to attain to a realistic picture of electromagnetism. * While keeping strictly to the historical order of things, we shall try first to form a picture of what happens when we conn ect two electrically charged bodies by a conductor. We know that we ri ghtly describe the change of the dynamic properties of the part of space, in which the two bodies ar e present, by saying that a certain electric field prevails in it. This field possesses di fferent 'potentials' at its various points and so there exists a certain potential differen ce between the two electric charges. What then happens when a so-called 'conducto r' is brought into such a field? From the point of view of the field-concept, conductivity consists in the property of a body not to allow any change of potential al ong its surface. Such a surface, therefore, is always an equipotential. In the language of alchemy, conductivity is a mercurial property. In the presence of such a body, therefore, no Salt-Sulphur contrasts can obtain. In view of what we found above as the mean position of the metals in the alchemic triad, it is significan t that they, precisely, shoul d play so outstanding a role as electrical conductors. If we keep to pure observation, the only st atement we can make concerning the effect produced by the introduction of such a body into the electric field is that this field"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" 182 suddenly disappears. We shall see later in which direction this vanishing occurs. For the present it is sufficient to have formed the picture of the disappearance of the electrical condition of sp ace as a result of the pres ence of a body with certain mercurial properties. Nothing else, indeed, happens when we make the process continuous by using a galvanic source of electricity. All that dis tinguishes a galvanic cell from the sources of electricity used before the time of Volta is its faculty of immediately re- establishing the field which prevails between its poles, whenever this field becomes extinguished by the presence of a conductor. Vo lta himself saw this quite correctly. In his first account of the new apparatus he describes it as 'Leyden jars with a continuously re-established charge'. Ever y enduring electrical process, indeed, consists in nothing but a va nishing and re-estab lishment of the electrical field with such rapidity that the whol e process appears continuous. Here, also, pure observation of the effect of a conductor in an elec tric field tells us that its action consists in the annihilation of the fiel d. There is no phenomenon which allows us to state that this process takes place along the axis of the conductor. If we wish to obtain a picture of th e true direction, we must c onsider the condition of space which arises in place of the elec tric condition that has disappeared. With the possibility of turn ing the cancellation of the electrical condition of space into a continuous process, it became possible to observe that the neutralization of electric charges entails the appearance of heat and magnetism. We must now ask which are the qualities of el ectricity on the one hand, and of heat and magnetism on the other, which account for the fact that wh ere electricity disapp ears, the two latter forces are bound to appear. Since magnetism is the still unknown entity among the three, we must now deal with it. * Unlike electricity, magnetism was first known in the form of its natural occurrence, namely as a property of certain minerals. If we follow the same course which led us to start our study of electric ity with the primitive process of generating it, we shall turn now to the basic phenomenon produced by a magnetic field alre ady in existence. (Only when we have learnt all we can from this, shall we proceed to ask how magnetism comes into being.) Obviously, we shall find this basic phenomenon in the effect of a magnet on a heap of iron filings. Let us, to begin with, compare a mass of solid iron with the same quantity of it in powdered form. The difference is that the powder lacks the binding force which holds the solid piece together. Now lei us expose the powdered iron to the influence of a magnet. At once a certain ordering principle takes hold of the single particles. They no longer lie at random and unrelated, apar t from the inconspicuous gravitational effect they exert on one another, but are dr awn into a coherent whole, thus acquiring properties resembling those of an ordinary piece of solid matter."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 183 Read thus, the phenomenon tells us that a part of space occupied by a magnetic field has qualities which are otherwise found only where a coherent solid mass is present. A magnetic piece of solid iron, therefore, differs from a non-magnetic piece by giving rise in its surroundings to dynamic conditions which would otherwise exist only in its interior. This picture of the relatedness of magnetism to solidity is confirmed by the fact that both are cancelled by heat, and increased by cold. 2 By its magnetic properties ir on thus reveals itself as a substance capable of assuming the condition of solid matter to a degr ee surpassing ordinary solidity. As an exceptional kind of metal it forms the count er-pole to mercury, in which the solid- fluid condition characteristic of all metal lic matter is as much shifted towards the fluid as in iron it is to the so lid. (Note in this respect the p eculiar resistance of iron to the liquefying effect which mercury has on the other metals.) This picture of magnetism enables us to understand at once why it must occur together with heat at the place where an el ectric polarity has been cancelled by the presence of a conductor. We have seen that electricity is levity coupled in a peculiar way with gravity; it is polarized levity (accompanied by a corre sponding polarization of gravity). An electric field, therefore, always has both qualities, those of levity and of gravity. We saw a symptom of this in el ectrical attraction and repulsion, so called; the attraction, we found, was due to ne gative density, the repulsion to positive density, imparted to space by the electrical fields presen t there. Now we see that when, through the presence of a conductor, the electrical field round the two opposing poles vanishes, in its place two other fields, a thermal and a magnetic, appear. Clearly, one of them represents the levity -part, the other the gravity-part, of the vanished electric field. The whole proce ss reminds one of combustion through which the ponderable and imponderable parts, combined in the combustible substance, fall apart and appear on the one hand as heat, and on the ot her as oxidized substance ('ash'). Yet, between these two manifestations of heat there is an essential qualitative difference. Although, from our view-point, magnetism represents only one 'half of a phenomenon, the other half of which is heat , we must not forget that it is itself a bipolar force. Thus, despite its apparent re lation to gravity it doe s not represent, as gravity does, one pole of a primary polarity, w ith heat as the othe r pole. Rather must it carry certain qualities of le vity which, together with t hose of gravity, appear in a polarically opposite manner at its two poles. (D etails of this will be shown later when we come to investigate the individual qua lities of the two pol es of magnetism and electricity.) Hence the heat that forms the counterpart to magnetism cannot be pure levity either. As the result of a certain coupling with gravity, it too has somehow remained polarically split. This can easily be seen by considerin g the following. Unlike the levity-gravity polarity, in which one pole is peripheral and the other poin t-centred, both Doles of the electrical polarity are point -centred; both are located in physical space, and thereby determine a definite direction within this sp ace. It is this direction which remains a"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" 184 characteristic of both the magnetic and the th ermal fields. The direction of the thermal field as much as that of the magnetic is determined by its having as its axis the conductor joining the poles of the anteceden t electrical field. Both fields supplement each other in that the thermal radiation fo rms the radii which belong to the circular magnetic lines-of-force surrounding the conductor. 3 Our picture of the process which is comm only called an electric current is now sufficiently complete to allow us to make a positive statement concerning the direction in which it takes plac e. Let us once more sum up: In order that this process may occur, there must be present in an el ectrically excited part of space a body which does not suffer the particular polarization of space bound up with such a field. As a result, the electrical field disappears, and in place of it appear a thermal field and a magnetic field, both having as their axis th e line connecting the two poles. Each of them spreads out in a direction at right angl es to this fine. Obviously, therefore, it is in this radial direction that the transf ormation of the electrical into the thermo- magnetic condition of space must take place. This picture of the electro- thermo-magnetic happening, as regards its direction, is in complete accord with the result obtained (a s indicated earlier) by the mathematical treatment of high-frequency phenomena. Once more we see that quite primitive observations, when properly read, lead to fi ndings for which scien tific thought had to wait until they were forced on it by the progres s of experimental technique - as even then science was left without a uniformly valid picture of the dynamic behaviour of electricity. Further, we can now see that when we appl y electricity to practical purposes, we are in fact seldom using electricity itself, but other forces (that is, other combinations of gravity and levity) which we make eff ective by making electricity disappear. The same is true of most of the methods of measuring electricity. As a rule, the force which sets the instrument in motion is not electricity but another force (magnetism, heat, etc.) which appears in the place of th e vanishing electricity. Thus the so-called intensity of an electric current is actually the intensity with which the electricity in question disappears! Electricity serves us in our machines in the same way that food serves a living organism: it gets itself di gested, and what matters is the resulting secondary product. Just as alterations in the el ectrical condition of space give rise to the appearance of a magnetic field, any alteration of the magne tic state of space gives rise to the appearance of an electrical field. This process is calle d electromagnetic induction. With its discovery, the generation of electr icity through friction and in the galvanic way was supplemented by a third way. By this means the practical use of electricity on a large scale became possible for the firs t time. If our picture of the two earlier processes of generating electric ity is correct, then this third way must also fit into the picture, although in this case we have no l onger to do with any direct atomization of physical matter. Our picture of magnetism w ill indeed enable us to recognize in"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 185 electromagnetic induction the same pr inciple on which we found the two other processes to rest. Magnetism is polarized gravity. Hence it has the same characteristic of tending always to maintain an existent condition. In bodies subject to gravity, this tendency reveals itself as their inertia. It is the inertia inherent in magnetism which we employ when using it to generate electricity. The simplest example is when, by interrupting a 'primary current', we induce a 'secondary current' in a neighbouring circuit. By the sudden alteration of the electric condition on the primary side, the magnetic condition of the surrounding space is exposed to a sudden corresponding change. Against this the magnetic field 'puts up' a resistance by calling forth, on the secondary side, an electrical process of such direction and strength that the entire magnetic condition remains first unaltered and then, instead of changing suddenly, undergoes a gradual transformation which ideally needs an infinite time for its accomplishment (asymptotic course of the e xponential curve). This principle rules every process of electromagnetic induction, whatever the cau se and direction of the change of the magnetic field. We know that electromagnetic induction take s place also when a conductor is moved across a magnetic field in such a way that, as the technical term goes, it 'cuts' the field's lines of force. Whereas the pro cess discussed above is employed in the transformer, this latter process is used in generation of electricity by dynamo. We have seen that a magnetic field imparts to the relevant part of space qualities of density which otherwise prevail only in the interior of solid masses. We remember further that the appearance of electricity, in the two other modes of generating it, is caused by the loosening of the coherence of the material substance. A similar loosening of the coherence of the magnetic field takes place when its field-lines are cut by the movement of the conductor across it. Just as heat occurs when we move a solid object through a liquid, el ectricity occurs when we move a conductor across a magnetic field. In each case we interfere w ith an existing levity-gravity relationship. * Having established thus far the picture of both electricity and magnetism which shows each as an outcome of certain levity -gravity interactions, we now ask how, in particular, negative and positive electric ity on the one hand and north and south magnetism on the other are determined by thes e interactions. Let us again begin with electricity. We remember that Galvani was led to his observations by the results of Walsh's study of the electric fishes. While Galvani clung to the view that in his own experiments the source of the electrical force lay within the animal bodies, Volta saw the fallacy of that. He then conceived the idea of imitati ng with purely inorgani c substances the set- up which Galvani had come upon by accident. Th e paradoxical result - as he himself noticed with surprise - was that his apparatu s turned out to be a close replica of the"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 186 peculiar organ with which the electric fi shes are endowed by nature. We must now take a closer view of this organ. The electric organ of such a fish consists of many thousands of little piles, each made up of a very great number of plates of tw o different kinds, arranged in alternating layers. The two kinds differ in substance: in one case the plate is made from a material similar to that pres ent in the nervous system of animals; in the other the resemblance is to a substance present in the muscular system, though only when the muscles are in a state of decay. In this way the two opposing systems of the animal body' seem to be brought here into direct contact, repeated many thousands of times. In the electric fishes, accordingly, sensa tion and will are brought into a peculiar interrelation. For the will-pol e is related to its bodily foundation in a manner which otherwise obtains only between the nervous system and the psychological processes co-ordinated with it. These fishes then ha ve the capacity to send out force-currents which produce in other animals and in man 'concussion of the limbs', or in extreme cases paralysis and even deat h. Through describing the proce ss in this way we realize that electricity appears here as metamorphos ed animal will, which takes this peculiar form because part of the animal's volitiona l system is assimilated to its sensory system in an exceptional manner. It is known to-day that what nature reveal s so strikingly in the case of the electric fish, is nothing but the manifestation of a prin ciple at work in the bodies of all beings endowed with sensation and volition - in corporeal term s, with the duality of a nervous and a muscular system - and th erefore at work also in the human body. Observation has shown that the activities of these two systems in man and animal are accompanied by the occurrence of different electr ic potentials in different parts of the body. Plate A, Fig. iii, shows the distribution of the two polar electric forces in the human body. The bent lines in the diagram sta nd for curves of equal electric potential. The straight line between them is the neut ral zone. As might be expected, this line runs through the heart. What seems less obvious is its slanting position. Here the asymmetry, characteristic of the human body, comes to expression. If we remember that the nervous system re presents the salt-pole, and the metabolic system the sulphur-pole, of the human orga nism, and if we take into account the relationship between levity and gravity at the two poles, we can see from the distribution of the two electri cities that the c oupling of levity and gravity at the negative pole of the electrical polarity is such that levity descends into gravity, while at the positive pole gravity ri ses into levity. Negative electricity therefore must have somehow a 'spherical' character, and positive electricity a 'radial'. This finding is fully confirmed by electrical phenomena in the realm of nature most remote from man (though it was an effort to solve the enigma of man which led to the discovery of this realm). Since Crookes's obs ervations of the beha viour of electricity in a vacuum it is common knowledge that only the negative kind of electricity occurs as a freely radiating force (though it retains some propert ies of inertia), whereas"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 187 positive electricity seems to be much mo re closely bound to minute particles of ponderable matter. Here again we find grav ity-laden levity on the negative side, levity-raised gravity on the positive. The same language is spoken by the forms in which the luminous phenomena appear at the two poles of a Crookes tube. Fi g. i on Plate A represents the whole phenomenon as far as such a diagram allows. Here we see on the positive side radial forms appear, on the negative side planar-sph erical forms. As symbols of nature's script, these forms tell us that cosmic peri phery and earthly cent re stand in a polar relation to each other at the two ends of the tube. (Our op tical studies will later show that the colours which appear at the anode and cathode are also in complete accord with this.) At this point in our discussion it is possibl e to raise, without ri sk of confusing the issue, the question of the di stribution of the two electri c forces over the pairs of substances concerned in the generation of electricity both by friction and in the galvanic way. This distribution seems to cont radict the picture to which the foregoing observations have led us, for in both instan ces the 'sulphurous' substances (resin in one, the nobler metals in the other) become bearers of nega tive electricity; while the 'saline' substances (glass and the corrosiv e metals) carry positive electricity. Such a criss-crossing of the poles-sur prising as it seems at first si ght - is not new to us. We have met it in the distribution of function of the plant's organs of propagation, and we shall meet a further instance of it when studying the function of the human eye. Future investigation will have to find the principle common to all instances in nature where such an interchang e of the poles prevails. While the electric field aris ing round an electrif ied piece of matter does not allow any recognition of the absolute characteristics of the two opposing electrical forces, we do find them revealed by the di stribution of electricity in the human body. Something similar holds good for magnetism. Only, to find the phenomena from which to read the absolute characteristics of the two side s of the magnetic polarity, we must not turn to the body of man but to that of the earth, one of whose characteris tics it is to be as much the bearer of a magnetic field as of gr avitational and levitational fields. There is significance in the fact that even to-day, when the tendency prevails to look for causes of natural phenomena not in the macr ocosmic expanse, but in the microscopic confines of space, the two poles of magneti sm are named after the magnetic poles of the earth. It indicates the degree to wh ich man's feeling instinctively relates magnetism to the earth as a whole. In our newly developed terminology we may say that magnetism, as a polarity of the second order, represents a field of force both of whose poles are situ ated within finite space, and that in the macro-tell uric mother-field this situati on is such that the axis of this field coincides more or less with th e axis of the earth's physical body. Thus the magnetic polarization of the earth as a letter in nature's script bids us rank it alongside other phenomena which in their way are an expression of the earth's being polarized in the north-south direction."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 188 The Austrian geographer, E. Suess, in his great work The Countenance of the Earth, first drew attention to the f act that an observer approachi ng the earth from outer space would be struck by the onesided distributi on and formation of th e earth's continents. He would notice that most of the dry land is in the northern hemisphere, leaving the southern hemisphere covered mainly with water. In terms of the basic elementary qualities, this means that the earth is pr edominantly 'dry' in its northern half, and 'moist' in its southern. In this fact we have a symbol which tells us that the earth represents a polarity of the second order, with its 'salt'-pole in the nor th and its 'sulphur'-pole in the south. Hence the magnetism called 'North' must be of saline and therefore spherical nature, corresponding to the negative pole in the re alm of electricity, while 'South' magnetism must be of sulphurous - i.e. radial-nat ure, corresponding to positive electricity. Moreover, this must hold good equally for th e fields of magnetic force generated by naturally magnetic or artificial ly magnetized pieces of iron. For the circumstance that makes a piece of matter into a magnet is simply that part of the general magnetic field of the earth has been drawn into it. Of esp ecial interest in this respect is the well- known dependence of the direction of an electrically produced magnetic field on the position of the poles of the electric field. * The insight we have now gained into the nature of electricity has led us to the realization that with every act of setting electromagne tic energies in motion we interfere with the entire levity-gravity bala nce of our planet by turning part of the earth's coherent substance into cosmic 'dust'. Remembering our picture of radioactivity, in which we r ecognized a sign of the earth's old age, we may say that whenever we generate electricity we speed up the earth's process of cosmic ageing. Obviously this is tremendously enhanced by the creation of artif icial radioactivity along the lines recently discovered, whereby it has now become possible to transmute chemical elements into one another, or ev en to cancel altogether their gravity-bound existence. To see things in this light is to realize that with our having become able to rouse electricity and magnetism from their dormant state and make them work for us, a gigantic responsibility has devolved upon mankind. It was man's fate to remain unaware of this fact during the first phase of the electrification of his civilization; to continue now in this state of unawarene ss would spell peril to the human race. The fact that modern science has long ceased to be a 'natural' science is something which has begun to dawn upon the modern scie ntific researcher himself. What has thus come to him as a question finds a defin ite answer in the pict ure of electricity we have been able to develop. It is again E ddington who has drawn attention particularly to this question: see the chapter, 'Discovery or Manufacture?' in his Philosophy of Physical Science.

Eddington starts by asking: 'When Lord Ruth erford showed us the atomic nucleus, did he find it or did he make it?' Whichever answer we give, Eddington goes on to say, makes no difference to our admiration fo r Rutherford himself. But it makes all the difference to our ideas on the structure of the physical universe. To make clear where the modern physicist stands in th is respect, Eddington uses a striking comparison. If a sculptor were to point in our presence to a raw block of marble saying that the form of a human head was lying hidden in the block, 'all our rational instinct would be roused against such an anthropomorphic speculation'. For it is inconceivable to us that nature should ha ve placed such a form inside the block. Roused by our objection, the artist proceeds to verify his theory experimentally - 'with quite rudimentary apparatus, too: merely using a chisel to separate the form for our inspection, he triumphan tly proves his theory.' 'Was it in this way', Eddington asks, 'that Rutherford rendered concrete the nucleus which his scientific imaginat ion had created?' One thing is certain: 'In every physical laboratory we see ingeniously devised tool s for executing the work of sculpture, according to the designs of the theoretical physicist. Sometimes the tool slips and carves off an odd-shaped form which he had not expected. Then we have a new experimental discovery,' To this analogy Eddington adds the following ev en more drastic one: 'Procrustes, you will remember,' he says, 'stretched or chopped down his guests to fit the bed he constructed. But perhaps you have not heard th e rest of the story. He measured them up before they left the next mo rning, and wrote a learned paper On the Uniformity of Stature of Travellers for the Anthropological Society of Attica.' * Besides yielding a definite answer to the question of how far the seemingly discovered facts of science are manufactured facts, our newly won insight into the nature of the electric and magnetic polarties throws light also on the possibility of so handling both that their app lication will lead no longer to a cancellation, but to a true continuation, of nature's own creative deeds. An example of this will appear in the next part of our studies, devoted to observations in the field of optics. 1 Note that the series starts on the left with graphite , i.e. with carbon. This substance appears here as a metal among metals, and indeed as the most 'noble' of all.

Excellent poets have lived at the same time as myself; poets more excellent have lived before me, and others will come after me. But that in my century I am the only person who knows the truth in the difficult science of colours - of that, I say, I am not a little proud, and here I have a consciousness of a superiority to many.' In these words spoken to his secretary, Eckermann, in 1829, a few years before his death, Goethe gave his opinion on the significa nce of his scientific researches in the field of optical phenomena. He knew that the path he had opened up had led him to truths which belong to the or iginal truths of mankind. He expressed this by remarking that his theory of colour was 'as old as the world'. If in this book we come somewhat late to a discussion of Goethe 's colour-theory, in spite of the part it played in his own scien tific work, and in spite of its significance for the founding of a physics based on his met hod, the reasons are these. When Goethe undertook his studies in this field he had not to reckon with the forms of thought which have become customary since the de velopment of mechanistic and above all - to put it concisely - of 'electricalistic' th inking. Before a hearing can be gained in our age for a physics of Light and Colour as conceived by Goethe, certain hindrances must first be cleared away. So a picture on the one hand of matter, and on the other of electricity, such as is given when they ar e studied by Goethean methods, had first to be built up; only then is the ground provided for an unprejudiced judgment of Goethe's observations and the deductions that can be made from them to-day. As Professor Heisenberg, in his lecture quoted earlier (Chapter II), rightly remarks, Goethe strove directly with Newton only in the realms of colour-theory and optics. Nevertheless his campaign was not merely against Newton's opinions in this field. He was guided throughout by the conviction that the fundamental principles of the whole Newtonian outlook were at st ake. It was for this reas on that his polemics against Newton were so strongly expresse d, although he had no fondness for such controversies. In looking back on that part of the Farbenlehre which he had himself called 'Polemical' in the title, he said to Eckermann: 'I by no means disavow my severe dissections of the Newtonian statements; it was necessary at the time and will also have its value hereafte r; but at bottom all polemical action is repugnant to my nature, and I can take but little pleasure in it.' The reason why Goethe chose optics as the fi eld of conflict, and devoted to it more than twenty years of resear ch and reflexion, amidst all the other labours of his rich life, lay certainly in his individual temperament - ' zum Sehen geboren, zum Schauen"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 192 bestellt '. 1 At the same time one must see here a definite guidance of humanity. Since the hour had struck for mankind to take th e first step towards overcoming the world- conception of the one-eyed, colour-blind onlook er, what step could have been more appropriate than this of Goethe's, when he raised the eye's capacity for seeing colours to the rank of an instrument of scientific cognition? In point of fact, the essen tial difference between Goethe's theory of colour and the theory which has prevailed in science (des pite all modifications) since Newton's day, lies in this: While the theory of Newt on and his successors was based on excluding the colour-seeing faculty of the eye, Goethe founded his theory on the eye's experience of colour. * In view of the present scient ific conception of the effect which a prismatic piece of a transparent medium has on light passing through it, Goethe's objection to Newton's interpretation and the conclusions drawn from it seems by no means as heretical as it did in Goethe's own time and for a hundred years afterwards. For, as Lord Rayleigh and others have shown, the facts responsible for the coming into being of the spectral colours, when these are produced by a di ffraction grating, invalidate Newton's idea that the optical apparatus serves to reveal colours which are inhe rent in the original light. Today it is known that these colours are an outcome of the interference of the apparatus (whether prism or grating) with the light. Thus we find Professor R. W. Wood, in the opening chapter of his Physical Optics, after having described the historical significance of Newton's con ception of the relation between light and colour, saying: 'Curiously enough, this disc overy, which we are taking as marking the beginning of a definite knowledge about light , is one which we shall demolish in the last chapter of this book, 2 for our present ideas regardi ng the action of the prism more nearly resemble the idea held previous to Newton's classical experiments. We now believe that the prism actually ma nufactures the coloured light.' We find ourselves faced here with an in stance of the problem, 'Discovery or Manufacture?' dealt with by Eddington in the manner described in our previous chapter. This very instance is indeed us ed by Eddington himself as a case in which the answer is definitely in favour of 'manufacture'. Nevertheless, Eddington complains, experts, in spite of knowing bette r, keep to the traditional way of speaking about the spectral colours as being originally contained in the light. 'Such is the glamour of a historical experiment.' 3 It is for the same reason that Goethe's discovery continues to be unrecognized by the majority of scientis ts, who prefer, instead of examining the question for themselves, to join in the traditional assertion that 'Goethe never understood Newton'. * As Goethe relates at the conclusi on of the 'historical' part of his Farbenlehre , 4 he was drawn to study colour by his wish to ga in some knowledge of the objective laws of"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 193 aesthetics. He felt too close to poetry to be able to study it with sufficient detachment, so he turned to painting - an art with which he felt suffi ciently familiar without being connected with it creatively - hoping that if he could discov er the laws of one art they would prove applicable to others. His visit to Italy, a land rich both in natural colour and in works of art, gave him a welcome opportunity to pursue this inquir y, but for a long time he made no headway. The paintings he saw suggested no inherent law in their arrangement of colours, nor could the painters he questi oned tell him of one. The only qualitative distinction they seemed to recognize was between 'cold' and 'warm' colours. His own observations led him to a definite experience of the quality of the colour blue, for which he coined th e phrase 'feebleness of blue' ('Ohnmacht des Blau'). In some way this colour seemed to him to be re lated to black. In orde r to rouse his artist friends and to stimulate their reflexions, he liked to indulge in pa radoxes, as when he asserted that blue was not a colour at a ll. He found, however, as time went on, that in this way he came no nearer his goal. Although the splendour of colour in the Ital ian sky and the Italian landscape made a powerful impression on Goethe, he found not enough opportunity for systematic study to allow him to arrive at more than a dim surmise of some law underlying the occurrence of colour in nature . Still, there was one thing he took home with him as a result of his labours. He had grown convinced that 'the first approach to colours as physical phenomena had to be sought from th e side of their occurrence in nature, if one would gain an understanding of them in relation to art'. Back at home, he strove to recollect the theory of Newton as it was being taught in schools and universities - namely, that 'colours in their totality are contained in light'. Hitherto he had had no occasion to doubt the correctness of this theory. Like everyone else, he had heard it expounded in lectures as an inc ontestable result of empirical observation, though w ithout this ever having been shown to him by way of experiment. He convinced himself by cons ulting a manual that his recollection was correct, but at the same time he found that the theory there set forth gave no help in answering his questions. 5 So he decided to examine the phenomena for himself. For this purpose he borrowed a set of prisms from a friend living in near-by Jena, the physicist, BAUttner. Since, however, he had at that time no oppor tunity of arranging a dark chamber on Newton's lines, where the ne cessary ray of light from a tiny hole in the window-covering was sent through a prism, he postponed the whole thing, until in the midst of all his many other interests a nd duties it was forgotte n. In vain BAUttner pressed many times for the return of the prisms; at last he sent a mutual acquaintance with the injunction no t to return without them. Goet he then searched for the long- neglected apparatus and determined to take a rapid glance through one of the prisms before he gave them back."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" 194 He recalled dimly his pleasure as a boy at the vision of the world given him through a bit of similarly shaped glass. 'I well rememb er that everything l ooked coloured, but in what manner I could no longer recollect. I was just then in a room completely white; remembering the Newtonian theory, I expecte d, as I put the prism to my eye, to find the whole white wall coloured in different hues and to see the light reflected thence into the eye, split into as many coloured lights. 'But how astonished was I when the wh ite wall seen through the prism remained white after as before. Only where someth ing dark came against it a more or less decided colour was shown, and at last the window-bars appeared most vividly coloured, while on the light-grey sky outside no trace of colouring was to be seen. It did not need any long considera tion for me to recognize that a boundary or edge is necessary to call forth the colours, and I immediately said aloud, as though by instinct, that the Newtonian doctrine is false.' For Goethe, there could be no more thought of sending back the prisms, and he persuaded BAUttner to leave them with him for some time longer. Goethe adds a short account of the progr ess of the experiments he now undertook as well as of his efforts to interest others in his discovery. He makes grateful reference to those who had brought him understanding, and who had been helpful to him through the exchange of thoughts. Among these, apart from Schiller, whom Goethe especially mentions, we find a number of leading anat omists, chemists, writers and philosophers of his time, but not a single one of the phys icists then active in teaching or research. The 'Guild' took up an attitude of complete disapproval or indifference, and so have things remained till a hundred years afte r his death, as Goethe himself prophesied. One of the first systematic pieces of work which Goethe undertook in order to trace the cause of the Newtonian error was to go through Book I of Newton's Optics, sentence by sentence, recapitulate Newton's experiments and rearrange them in the order which seemed to him essential. In so doing he gained an insight which was fundamental for all future work, and often pr oved very beneficial in the perfecting of his own methods. His examination of the Ne wtonian procedure showed him that the whole mistake rested on the fact that 'a complicated phenomenon should have been taken as a basis, and the simpler explaine d from the complex'. Nevertheless, it still needed 'much time and application in order to wander through all the labyrinths with which Newton had been pleased to confuse his successors'. * It seems a small thing, and yet it is a great one, which Goethe, as the above description shows, discovered almost by ch ance. This is shown by the conclusions to which he was led in the systematic prosecutions of his discovery. An account of them is given in his BeitrÃ¤ge zur Optik , 6 published in 1791, the year in which Galvani came before the public with his observa tions in the sphere of electricity."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 195 Goethe describes in this book the basic phe nomena of the creation of the prismatic colours, with particulars of a number of e xperiments so arranged that the truth he had discovered, contrary to Newton's view, co mes to light through the very phenomena themselves. Only much later, in the year 1810, and after he had brought to a certain conclusion four years previously the resear ches which he had pursued most carefully the whole time, did he make public the actual masterpiece, Entwurf einer Farbenlehre . 7 (An English translation of the dida ctic part appeared about ten years after Goethe's death.) While leaving a more detailed descri ption of the composition of Goethe's Entwurf for our next chapter, we shall here deal at on ce with some of the essential conclusions to which the reader is led in this book. As al ready mentioned, Goethe's first inspection of the colour-phenomenon produced by the prism had shown him that the phenomenon depended on the presence of a boundary between light and darkness. Newton's attempt to explain the spectrum out of light alone appeared to him, therefore, as an inadmissible setting asid e of one of the two necessary conditions. Colours, so Goethe gleane d directly from the prismatic phenomenon, are caused by both light and its counterpart, darkness. Hence, to arrive at an idea of the nature of colour, which was in accord with its actua l appearance, he saw himself committed to an investigation of the extent to which the qualitative differe nces in our experience of colours rests upon their differing prop ortions of light and darkness. It is characteristic of Goethe's whole mode of procedure that he at once changed the question, 'What is colour?' into the questi on, 'How does colour arise?' It was equally characteristic that he did not , as Newton did, shut himself into a darkened room, so as to get hold of the colour-phenomenon by m eans of an artificially set-up apparatus. Instead, he turned first of all to nature, to let her give him the an swer to the questions she had raised. It was clear to Goethe that to trace the law of the genesis of colour in nature by reading her phenomena, he must keep a l ook-out for occurrences of colours which satisfied the conditions of the Ur-phÃ¤nomen, as he had learned to know it. This meant that he must ask of nature where sh e let colours arise out of light and darkness in such a way that no other conditions contributed to the effect. He saw that such an effect was presented to his eye when he turned his gaze on the one hand to the blue sky, and on the othe r to the yellowish luminous sun. Where we see the blue of the heavens, there, spread out before our eyes, is universal space, which as such is dark. Why it does not appear dark by day as well as by night is because we see it through the sun-illumine d atmosphere. The opposite role is played by the atmosphere when we look through it to the sun. In the first instance it acts as a lightening, in the second as a darkeni ng, medium. Accordingly, when the optical density of the air changes as a result of its va rying content of mo isture, the colour- phenomenon undergoes an opposite change in each of the two cases. Whilst with increasing density of the air the blue of the sky brightens up and gradually passes"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" 196 over into white, the yellow of the sun gr adually darkens and finally gives way to complete absence of light. The ur-phenomenon having once been discovered in the heavens, could then easily be found elsewhere in nature on a large or sma ll scale-as, for instance, in the blue of distant hills when the air is sufficiently opa que, or in the colour of the colourless, slightly milky opal which looks a deep blue when one sees it against a dark background, and a reddish yellow when one holds it against the light. The same phenomenon may be produced artificially thr ough the clouding of gl ass with suitable substances, as one finds in va rious glass handicraft objects. The aesthetic effect is due to the treated glass being so fashioned as to present conti nually changing angles to the light, when both colour-poles and all the in termediate phases appear simultaneously. It is also possible to pr oduce the ur-phenomenon experi mentally by placing a glass jug filled with water before a black background, illuminating the jug from the side, and gradually clouding the water by the admi xture of suitable substances. Whilst the brightness appearing in the di rection of the light goes ove r from yellow and orange to an increasingly red shade, the darkness of the black background brightens to blue, which increases and passes over to a milky white. It had already become clear to Goethe in It aly that all colour-expe rience is based on a polarity, which he found expressed by painte rs as the contrast between 'cold' and 'warm' colours. Now that the coming-into-being of the blue of the sky and of the yellow of the sun had shown themselves to him as two processes of opposite character, he recognized in them th e objective reason why both colours are subjectively experienced by us as opposites. 'Blue is illumined darkness - yellow is darkened light' - thus could he assert the urphenomenon, while he expressed the relation to Light of colours in their to tality by saying: 'Colours are Deeds and Sufferings of Light.' With this, Goethe had taken the first decisi ve step towards his goal - the tracing of man's aesthetic experience to objective facts of nature. If we use the expressions of preceding chapte rs, we can say that Goethe, in observing the coloured ur-phenomenon, had succeeded in finding how from the primary polarity, Light-Dark, the opposition of the yellow and blue colours arises as a secondary polarity. For such an interplay of light and darkness, the existence of the air was seen to be a necessa ry condition, representing in the one case a lightening, in the other, a darkening element. That it was able to play th is double role arose from its being on the one hand pervious to light, while yet possessing a certain substantial density. For a medium of such a nature Goethe coined the expression trAUbes Medium. There seems to be no suitable word in English for rendering the term trAUbe in the sense in which Goethe used it to denote the optical resistance of a more or less transparent medium. The following remarks of Goethe's, reported by his secretary Riemer, will give the reader a picture of what Goethe meant by this term, clear"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" 197 enough to allow us to use the German word. Goethe's explanation certainly shows how inadequate it is to translate trAUbe by 'cloudy' or 'semi-opaque' as commentators have done. 'Light and Dark ha ve a common field, a space, a vacuum in which they are seen to appear. This space is the realm of th e transparent. Just as the different colours are related to Light and Dark as their creativ e causes, so is their corporeal part, their medium, TrAUbe, related to the transparent. The first diminution of the transparent, i.e. the first slightest filling of space, the first disposition, as it were, to the corporeal, i.e. the non-transparent - this is TrAUbe. ' 8 After Goethe had once determined from the macrotelluric phenomenon that an interplay of light and darkness within TrAUbe was necessary for the appearance of colour in space, he had no doubt that the prismatic colours, too, could be understood only through the coming together of all thes e three elements. It was now his task to examine in what way the prism, by its being trAUbe, brings light and darkness, or, as he also expressed it, light and shadow, into interplay, when they meet at a boundary. We must remember that on first looking through the prism Go ethe had immediately recognized that the appearance of colour is always depe ndent on the existence of a boundary between light and darkness - in othe r words, that it is a border phenomenon. What colours appear on such a border depe nds on the position of light and darkness in relation to the base of the prism. If the lighter part is nearer to the base, then blue and violet tints are seen at the border, a nd with the reverse position tints of yellow and red (Plate B, Fig. i). Along this path of study Goethe found no reason for regarding the spectrum-phenomenon as co mplete only when both kinds of border- phenomena appear simultaneously (let alone when - as a result of the smallness of the aperture through which the light meets the prism - the two edges lie so close that a continuous band of colour arises). Hence we find Goethe - unlike Newton - treating the two ends of the spectrum as two separate phenomena. In this way, the spectrum phenomenon ga ve Goethe confirmation that he had succeeded in expressing in a generally valid fo rm the law of the origin of the blue and the yellow colours, as he had read it fr om the heavens. For in the spectrum, too, where the colour blue appears, there he saw darkness being lightened by a shifting of the image of the border between light and da rk in the direction of darkness; where yellow appears, he saw light being darkened by a shifting of the image in the direction of light. (See the arrow in Fig. i.) In the colours adjoining these - indigo and violet on the blue si de, orange and red on the yellow side - Goethe recognized 'height ened' modifications of blue and yellow. Thus he had learnt from the macro-telluric realm that with decreasing density of the corporeal medium, the blue sky takes on ev er deeper tones, while with increasing density of the medium, the yellow of the s unlight passes over into orange and finally red. Prismatic phenomenon and macrotellu ric phenomenon were seen to correspond in this direction, too."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" 198 Faithful to his question, 'How does colour arise?' Goethe now proceeded to investigate under what conditions two bor ders, when placed opposite each other, provide a continuous band of colour - that is, a colour-band where, in place of the region of uncoloured light, gr een appears. This, he obs erved, came about if one brought one's eye, or the scr een intercepting the light, to that distance from the prism where the steadily widening yellow-red and the blue-violet colou r-cones merge (Fig. ii). 9 Obviously, this distance can be altere d by altering the distance between the two borders. In the case of an extremely narro w light-space, the blue and yellow edges will immediately overlap. Yet the emergence of the green colour will always be due to a union of the blue and yellow colours which spread from the two edges. This convinced Goethe that it is inadmissible to place the green in the spectrum in line with the other colours, as is customary in the explanation of the spectrum since Newton's time. This insight into the relati on of the central colour of the continuous spectrum to its other colours still further strengthened Goethe's conviction that in the way man experiences nature in his soul , objective laws of nature co me to expression. For just as we experience the colours on the blue side of the spectrum as cold colours, and those on the yellow side as warm colours, so does green give man the impression of a neutral colour, influencing us in neither di rection. And just as the experience of the two polar colour-ranges is an expression of the objective natural law behind them, so too is the experience of green, the objectiv e conditions of whose origin give it a neutral position between the two. With this it also became clear why the vegetative part of the plant organism, the region of leaf and stem formation, where the light of the sun enters into a living union with the density of earthly substance, must appear in a garment of green. * Having in this way found the clue to the tr ue genesis of the spectrum, Goethe could not fail to notice that it called for another - a 'negative' spectrum, its polar opposite - to make the half into a whole. For he w ho has once learnt that light and darkness are two equally essential factors in the birt h of colour, and that the opposing of two borders of darkness so as to enclose a light is a 'derived' (abgeleitet) experimental arrangement, is naturally free to alte r the arrangement and to supplement it by reversing the order of the two borders, thus letting tw o lights enclose a darkness between them. If one exposes an arrangement like this to the action of the prism, whose position has remained unchanged, colours appear on each of the two edges, as before, but in reverse order (Fig. iii). The spectral phenom enon now begins at one side with light blue and passes into indigo and violet, with uncoloured darkness in the centre. From this darkness it emerges through red and passe s through orange to yellow at the other end."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 199 Again, where the two interior colour-cones me rge, there an additional colour appears. Like green, it is of a neutral character, but at the same ti me its quality is opposite to that of green. In Newtonian optics, which assumes colour to be derived from light only, this colour has naturally no existence. Yet in an optics which has learnt to reckon with both darkness and light as gene rators of colour, the complete spectrum phenomenon includes this colour equally wi th green. For lack of an existing proper name for it, Goethe termed it 'pure red' (s ince it was free from both the blue tinge of the mauve, and the yellow tinge of the red end of the ordinary spectrum), or 'peach- blossom' (pfirsichblaet), or 'purple' (as being nearest to the dye-stuff so called by the ancients after the mollusc from which it was obtained). 10 It needs only a glance through the prism into the sunlit world to make one convinced of the natural appearing of this delicate and at the same time powerfully luminous colour. For a narrow dark object on a light field is a much commoner occurrence in nature than the enclosing by two broad objects of a narrow space of light, the condition necessary for the emergence of a continuous colour-band with green in the middle. In fact, the spectrum which scienc e since the time of Newton regards as the only one, appears much more rarely among natural conditions than does Goethe's counter-spectrum. With the peach-blossom a fresh proof is supplied that what man experiences in his soul is in harmony with the objective facts of nature. As with green, we experience peach-blossom as a colour that leaves us in equilibrium. With peach-blossom, however, the equilibrium is of a different kind, owing to the fact that it arises from the union of the colour-poles, not at their original stage but in their 'heightened' form. And so green, the colour of the plant-world harmony given by nature, stands over against 'purple', the colour of the human being striving towards harmony. By virtue of this quality, purple served from antiquity for the vesture of those who have reached the highest stage of human development for their time. This characteristic of the middle colours of the two spectra was expres sed by Goethe when he called green 'real totality', and peach-blossom 'ideal totality'. From this standpoint Goethe was able to smile at the Newtonians. He could say that if they persisted in asserting that the colourle ss, so-called 'white' light is composed of the seven colours of the ordinary spectrum - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet - then they were in duty bound to ma intain also that th e colourless, 'black' darkness is composed of the seven colours of the inverted spectrum - yellow, orange, red, purple, violet , indigo, blue. Despite the convincing force of this argumen t, the voice of the Hans Andersen child speaking through Goethe failed to gain a hearing among the crowd of Newtonian faithful. So has it been up to the present day - regardless of the fact that, as we have shown, modern physics has reached result s which make a contradiction of the Newtonian concept of the mutual relation of light and colour no longer appear so heretical as it was in Goethe's time."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" 200 * When we compare the way in which Go ethe, on the one hand, and the physical scientist, on the othe r, have arrived at the truth that what Newton held to be 'discovery' was in actual fact 'manufactur e', we find ourselves faced with another instance of a fact which we ha ve encountered before in our study of electricity. It is the fact that a truth, which reveals itself to the spectator-scientist only as the result of a highly advanced experimental researc h, can be recognized through quite simple observation when this observation is carried out with the inten tion of letting the phenomena themselves speak for their 'theory'. Furthermore, there is a corresponding differe nce in the effect the knowledge of such truth has on the human mind. In the field of el ectricity we saw that together with the scientist's recognition of the absolute qualities of the two polar forms of electricity a false semblance of reality was lent to the hypothesis of the atomic structure of matter. Something similar has occurred in the field of optics. Here, after having been forced to recognize the fallacy of Newton's theor y, the spectator's mind has been driven to form a concept of the nature of light whic h is further than ever from the truth. For what then remains of light is - in Eddingt on's words - a 'quite irregular disturbance, with no tendency to periodicity', which mean s that to light is a ssigned the quality of an undefined chaos (in the negative sense of this word) sprung from pure chance. Moreover, as Eddington shows, the question whether the optical contrivance 'sorts out' from the chaotic light a particular peri odicity, or whether it 'impresses' this on the light, becomes just 'a matter of expression'. 11 So here, too, the modern investigator is driven to a resigned acknowledgment of the principle of Indeterminacy. No such conclusions are forced upon th e one who studies the spectrum phenomenon with the eyes of Goethe. Like the modern experimenter, he, too, is faced with the question 'Discovery or Manufacture?' a nd he, too, finds the answer to be 'Manufacture'. But to him nature can disc lose herself as the real manufacturer, showing him how she goes to work in bringing about the colours, because in following Goethe he is careful to arrange hi s observations in such a way that they do not veil nature's deeds. 1 'To see is my dower, to look my employ.'

It leads us to the study of our own process of sight, by means of which we grow aware of the optical facts in outer space. * The importance which Goethe himself saw in this aspect of the optical problem is shown by the place he gave it in the didactic part of his Farbenlehre. The first three chapters, after the Introduction, are called 'P hysiological Colours', 'Physical Colours', and 'Chemical Colours'. In the first chapter, Goethe summarizes a group of phenomena which science calls 'subjective' co lours, since their origin is traced to events within the organ of sight. The next chapter deals with an actual physics of colour - that is, with the a ppearance of colours in external space as a result of the refraction, diffraction and polari zation of light. The third ch apter treats of material colours in relation to chemical and other influences. After two chapters which need not concern us here comes th e sixth and last chapter, en titled 'Physical-Moral Effect of Colour' (' Sinnlich-sittliche Wirkung der Farben'), which crowns the whole. There, for the first time in the history of modern science, a bridge is built between Physics, Aesthetics and Ethics. We re member it was with this aim in view that Goethe had embarked upon his search for the so lution of the problem of colour. In this chapter the experiencing of the va rious colours and their interplay through the human soul is treated in many aspects, and Goet he is able to show that what arises in man's consciousness as qualitative colou r-experience is noth ing but a direct 'becoming-inward' of what is manifested to the 'reader's' eye and mind as the objective nature of colours. So, in one re alm of the sense-world, Goethe succeeded in closing the abyss which divides existence a nd consciousness, so l ong as the latter is restricted to a mere onlooker-rela tionship towards the sense-world. If we ask what induced Goethe to treat the physiological colours before the physical colours, thus deviating so ra dically from the order customary in science, we shall find the answer in a passage fr om the Introduction to his Entwurf. Goethe, in giving his views on the connexion between light and the eye, says: 'The eye owes its existence to light. Out of indifferent auxiliary animal organs the light calls forth an organ for itself, similar to its own nature; thus the eye is formed by the light, for the light, so that the inner light can meet the outer.' In a verse, which reproduces in poetic form a thought originally expressed by Plotinus, Goethe sums up his idea of the creative connexion between eye and light as follows:"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 203 ' Unless our eyes had something of the sun, Ho w could we ever look upon the light? Unless there lived within us God's own might, How could the Godlike give us ecstasy? 1 (Trans. Stawell-Dickinson) By expressing himself in this way in the Introduction to his Farbenlehre, Goethe makes it clear from the outset that when he speaks of 'light' as the source of colour- phenomena, he has in mind an idea of light very different from that held by modern physics. For in dealing with optics, physical science turns at once to phenomena of light found outside man - in fact to phenom ena in that physical realm from which, as the lowest of the kingdoms of nature, the observations of natural science are bound to start. Along this path one is driven, as we have seen, to conceive of light as a mere 'disturbance' in the universe, a kind of irregular chaos. In contrast to this, Goethe sees that to gain an explanati on of natural physical phenomena which will be in accord with natu re, we must approach them on the path by which nature brings them into being. In the field of light this path is one which leads from light as creative agent to light as mere phenomenon. The highest form of manifestation of creative light most directly resembling its Idea is within man. It is there that light creates for itself the or gan through which, as manifest light, it eventually enters into human consciousness. To Goethe it was th erefore clear that a theory of light, which is to proceed in acco rd with nature, should begin with a study of the eye: its properties, its ways of acti ng when it brings us information of its deeds and sufferings in external nature. The eye with its affinity to light comes into being in the apparently dark space of the mother's womb. This points to the possessi on by the human organism of an 'inner' light which first forms the eye from within, in order that it may afterwards meet the light outside. It is this inner light th at Goethe makes the starting-point of his investigations, and it is for this reason that he treats physiological colours before physical colours. * Of fundamental significance as regards me thod is the way in which Goethe goes on from the passage quoted above to speak of the activity of the inner light: 'This immediate affinity between light and the ey e will be denied by none; to consider them identical in substance is less easy to comprehe nd. It will be more intelligible to assert that a dormant light resides in the eye, and that this light can be excited by the slightest cause from within or from wit hout. In darkness we can, by an effort of imagination, call up the brightest images; in dreams, objects appear to us as in broad daylight; if we are awake, the slightest exte rnal action of light is perceptible, and if the organ suffers a mechanical impact light and colours spring forth.'"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" 204 What Goethe does here is nothing less than to follow the development of sight to where it has its true origin. Let us remember that a general sour ce of illusion in the modern scientific picture of the world lies in the fact that the onlooker-consciousness accepts itself as a self-contained ready- made entity, instead of tracing itself genetically to the states of consciousness from which it has developed in the course of evolution. In reality, the consciousness kindled by out er sense-perception was preceded by a dreaming consciousness, and th is by a sleeping consciousness, both for the individual and for humanity as a w hole. So, too, outer vision by means of the physical apparatus of the eye was preceded by an inner vision. In dreams we still experience this inner vision; we use it in the activity of our picture-forming imagination; and it plays continuously upon the process of external sight. Why we fail to notice this when using our eye in the ordinary way, is because of that dazzling process mentioned earlier in this book. Go ethe's constant endeavour was not to become the victim of this blindness - that is, not to be led by da y-time experience to forget the night-side of human life. The pa ssage quoted from the Introduction to his Farbenlehre shows how, in all that he strove for, he kept this goal in view. How inevitably a way of thinking that seek s an intuitive understa nding of nature is led to views like those of Goethe is show n by the following quotations from Reid and Ruskin, expressing their view of the relationship between th e eye, or the act of seeing, and external optical phenomena. In his Inquiry, at the beginning of his review of visual perceptions, Reid says: 'The structure of the eye, and of all its appurtenances, the admirable contrivances of nature for performing all its various external and internal motions and the variety in the eyes of different animals, suited to thei r several natures and wa ys of life, clearly demonstrate this organ to be a masterpiece of nature's work. And he must be very ignorant of what hath been discovered about it, or ha ve a very strange cast of understanding, who can seriously doubt, whether or not the rays of light and the eye were made for one another with consumma te wisdom, and perfect skill in optics .'' 3 The following passage from Ruskin's Ethics of the Dust (Lecture X) brings out his criticism of the scientific way of treating of optical phenomena: 'With regard to the most interesting of a ll their [the philosophers'] modes of force- light; they never consider how far the exis tence of it depends on the putting of certain vitreous and nervous substances into the formal arrangement which we call an eye. The German philosophers began the attack, long ago, on the other side, by telling us there was no such thing as light at all, unless we choose to see it. 2 Now, German and English, both, have reversed their engines, a nd insist that light would be exactly the same light that it is, though nobody could ever see it. The fact being that the force must be there, and the eye there, and 'light ' means the effect of the one on the other - and perhaps, also - (P lato saw farther into that myster y than anyone has since, that I know of) - on something a littl e way within the eyes.'"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" 205 Remarks like these, and the further quotati on given below, make it seem particularly tragic that Ruskin apparently had no knowledge of Goethe's Farbenlehre. This is the more remarkable in view of the significan ce which Turner, with whom Ruskin stood in such close connexion, ascrib ed to it from the standpoint of the artist. For the way in which Ruskin in his Modern Painters speaks of the effect of the modern scientific concept of colours upon the ethical-religious feeling of man, shows that he deplores the lack of just what Goethe had long since achieved in his Farbenlehre where, starting with purely physical ob servations, he had been able to develop from them a 'physical-moral' theory of colour. Ruskin's alertness to the effect on ethical lif e of a scientific worl d-picture empty of all qualitative values led him to write: 'It is in raising us from the first state of inactive reverie to the second of useful thought, that scientific pursuits are to be chiefly praised. Bu t in restraining us at this second stage, and checking the impulses towa rds higher contemplation, they are to be feared or blamed. They may in certain minds be consistent with such contemplation, but only by an effort; in their nature they are always adverse to it, having a tendency to chill and subdue the feelings, and to reso lve all things into atoms and numbers. For most men, an ignorant enjoyment is better than an informed one, it is better to conceive the sky as a blue dome than a da rk cavity, and the cloud as a golden throne than a sleety mist. I much question wh ether anyone who knows optics, however religious he may be, can feel in equal de gree the pleasure and reverence an unlettered peasant may feel at th e sight of a rainbow.' What Ruskin did not guess was that the rudi ments of the 'moral theory of light' for which he craved, as this passage indicat es, had been established by Goethe long before. * In the section of his Farbenlehre dealing with 'physiological colours', Goethe devotes by far the most space to the so-called 'after images' which appear in the eye as the result of stimulation by external light, and pe rsist for some little time. To create such an afterimage in a simple way, one need onl y gaze at a brightly lit window and then at a faintly lit wall of the room. The picture of the window appears there, but with the light-values reversed: the dark cross-bar appears as light, a nd the bright panes as dark. In describing this phenomenon Goethe first gives the usual explanation, that the part of the retina which was exposed to the light from the window-panes gets tired, and is therefore blunted for further impressions, wh ereas the part on which the image of the dark frame fell is rested, and so is more sensitive to the uniform impression of the wall. Goethe, however, at once adds that although this explanation may seem adequate for this special instance, there are other phenomena which can be accounted for only if they are held to derive from a 'higher source'. Goethe means experiences"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 206 with coloured after-images. This will be confirmed by our own discussion of the subject. What we first need, however, is a closer in sight into the physiological process in the eye which causes the after-images as such. Wherever Goethe speaks of a simple activity of the retina, we are in fact concerned with a co-operation of the retina with other parts of our organ of sight. In order to make this clear, let us consider how the eye adapts itself to varying c onditions of light and darkness. It is well known that if th e eye has become adjusted to darkness it is dazzled if suddenly exposed to light, even though the light be of no more than quite ordinary brightness. Here we enter a border region where the seeing process begins to pass over into a pathological condition. 4 A 'secret' of the effect of light on the eye is here revealed which remains hidden in ordinary vision, for normally the different forces working together in the eye hold each othe r in balance, so that none is able to manifest separately. This equilibrium is disturbed, however, when we suddenly expose the eye to light while it is adapted to darkness. The light then acts on the eye in its usual way, but without the immediat e counter-action which normally restores the balance. Under these conditions we no tice that the sudden dazzling has a painful influence on the eye - that is, an influen ce in some way destructive. This will not seem surprising if we remember that when light strikes on the b ackground of the eye, consciousness is quickened, and this, as we know, presupposes a breaking down of substance in some part of th e nervous system. Such a proces s does in fact occur in the retina, the nerve-part of the eye, when ex ternal light falls upon it. If the eye were solely a structure of nerves, it would be so far destroye d by the impact of light that it could not be restored even by sleep, as ar e the more inward parts of the nervous system. But the eye receives also a flow of blood, and we know that throughout the threefold human organism the blood supplie s the nervous system with building-up forces, polarically opposite to the destructive ones. In sleep, as we have already seen, the interruption of consciousness allows the blood to inundate the nervous system, as it were, with its healing, building-up activit y. It is not necessary, however, for the whole of the body to pass into a condition of sleep before this activity can occur. It functions to some extent also in the waki ng state, especially in those parts of the organism which, like the eye, serve in the highest degree the unfolding of consciousness. Having established this, we have a basis for an understanding of the complete process of vision. We see that it is by no means so lely the nerve part of the eye which is responsible for vision, as the spectator- physiology was bound to imagine. The very fact that the place where the optic nerve enters the eye is blind indicates that the function of mediating sight cannot be ascr ibed to the nerve alone. What we call 'seeing' is far more the result of an interp lay between the retina carrying the nerves, and the choroid carrying the blood-vessels. In this interplay the nerves are the passive, receptive organ for the inworking of external light, while the blood-activity comes to meet the nerve-process with a pr ecisely correlated acti on. In this action we find what Goethe called the 'inner light'."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" 207 The process involved in adaptation now b ecomes comprehensible. The cause of the dazzling effect of light of normal intensity on an eye adapted to the dark, is that in such an eye the blood is in a state of rest, and this preven ts it from exercising quickly enough the necessary counter-action to th e influence of the light. A corresponding effect occurs when one suddenly exposes to darkness the eye ad apted to light. One can easily observe what goes on then, if , after looking for a time at an undifferentiated light surface such as the ev enly luminous sky, one covers the opened eyes with the hollowed hands. It will then be found that the space before the eyes is filled by a sort of white light, and by payi ng close attention one recognizes that it streams from the eyes out into the hollowe d space. It may even be several minutes before the field of vision really appears bl ack, that is, before the activity of the inner light in the choroid has so far died away that equilibrium prevails between the non- stimulated nerves and the non-stimulated blood. With this insight into the twofold nature of the process of vision we are now able to describe more fully the negative after-image . Although in this case, as Goethe himself remarked, the ordinary explanation seems to suffice, yet in view of our later studies it may be well to bring forwar d here this wider conception. On the basis of our present findings it is no longer enough to trace the appearing of the after-image solely to a differential fatigue in the retina. The fact is that as long as the eye is turned to the bright window-pane a more intensive blood-activity occurs in the portions of the eye's background met by th e light than in those where the dark window-bar throws its shadow on the retina. If the eye so influenced is then directed to the faintly illumined wall of the room, the difference in the activity of the blood persists for some time. Hence in the pa rts of the eye adapted to darkness we experience the faint brightness as strongl y luminous, even dazzling, whereas in the parts more adapted to light we feel the same degree of brightness to be dark. That the action of the inner light is responsible for the differences becomes clear if, while the negative after-image is still visible, we darken the eye with the hollowed hands. Then at once in the dark field of vision the positive facsimile of the window appears, woven by the activity of the blood wh ich reproduces the outer reality. Having traced the colourless after-image to 'hi gher sources' - that is, to the action of the blood - let us now examine coloured af terimages. We need first to become conscious of the colour-creating light-act ivity which resides in the blood. For this purpose we expose the eyes for a moment to an intense light, and then darken them for a sufficient time. Nothing in external na ture resembles in beauty and radiance the play of colour which then arises, unless it be the colour phenomenon of the rainbow under exceptionally favourable circumstances. The physiological process which comes to cons ciousness in this way as an experience of vision is exactly the same as the proce ss which gives us experiences of vision in dreams. There is indeed evidence that when one awakens in a brightly lit room out of vivid dreaming, one feels less dazzled th an on waking from dreamless sleep. This indicates that in dream vision the blood in th e eye is active, just as it is in waking"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" 208 vision. The only difference is that in waki ng consciousness the stimulus reaches the blood from outside, through the eye, whereas in dreams it comes from causes within the organism. The nature of these causes does not concern us here; it will be dealt with later. For the moment it suffices to establish the fact th at our organism is supplied with a definite activity of forces which we experience as the appearance of certain images of vision, no matter from whic h side the stimulus comes. All vision, physiologically considered, is of the nature of dream vision; that is to say, we owe our day-waking sight to the fact th at we are able to encounter the pictures of the outer world, brought to us by the light, with a dreaming of the corresponding after-images. Just as the simple light-dark after-image show s a reversal of light-v alues in relation to the external picture, so in the coloured afterimages there is a quite definite and opposite relationship of their colours to those of the original picture. Thus, if the eyes are exposed for some time to an impression of the colour red, and then directed to a neutral surface, not too brightly illumina ted, one sees it covered with a glimmering green. In this way there is a reciprocal correspondence between the colour-pairs Red- Green, Yellow-Violet, Blue-Orange. To wh ichever of these six colours one exposes the eye, an after-image always appears of its contrast colour, forming with it a pair of opposites. We must here briefly recall how this phenomenon is generally explained on Newtonian lines. The starting-point is th e assumption that the eye becomes fatigued by gazing at the colour and gradually becomes insensitive to it. According to Newton's theory, if an eye thus affected l ooks at a white surface, the sum of all the colours comes from there to meet it, while the eye has a reduced sensitivity to the particular colour it has been gazing at. And so among the totality of colours constituting the 'white' light, this one is more or less non-existent for the eye. The remaining colours are then believed to cause the contrasting colour-impression. If we apply the common sense of the Hans Andersen child to this, we see where it actually leads. For it says no le ss than this: as l ong as the eye is in a normal condition, it tells us a lie about the world, for it makes white light seem someth ing that in reality it is not. For the truth to become apparent , the natural function of the eye must be reduced by fatigue. To believe that a body, f unctioning in this way, is the creation of God, and at the same time to look on this God as a Being of absolute moral perfection, would seem a complete contradict ion to the Hans Andersen child. In this contradiction and others of the same kind to which nowadays every child is exposed repeatedly and willy-nilly in school lessons a nd so on - we must seek the true cause of the moral uncertainty so characteristic of young people today. It was because Ruskin felt this that he called for a 'moral' theory of light. Since Goethe did not judge ma n from artificially devised experiments, but the latter from man, quite simple reflexions led him to the following view of the presence of the contrasting colour in the coloured af ter-images. Nature outside man had taught him that life on all levels takes it course in a perpetual interplay of opposites, manifested externally in an interplay of di astole and systole comparable to the process"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 209 of breathing. He, therefore, traced the interchange of li ght-values in colourless after- images to a 'silent resistance which every vital principle is forced to exhibit when some definite condition is presented to it. Thus, inhalation presupposes exhalation; thus every systole, its diastole. When da rkness is presented to the eye, the eye demands brightness, and vice versa: it reveal s its vital energy, its fitness to grasp the object, precisely by bringing forth out of its elf something contra ry to the object.' Consequently he summarizes his reflex ions on coloured afterimages and their reversals of colour in these words: 'The eye demands actual completeness and closes the colour-circle in itself.' How true this is, the law connecting the corresponding colours shows, as may be seen in the fo llowing diagram. Here, red, yellow and blue as three primary colours confront the th ree remaining colours, green, violet and orange in such a way that each of the latt er represents a mixture of the two other primary colours. (Fig. 10.) Colour and contrast-colour are actually so related that to whatever colour the eye is exposed it produces a counter-colour so as to have the sum-total of all the three primary colours in itself. And so, in conse quence of the interplay of outer and inner light in the eye, there is always present in it the totality of all the colours. It follows that the appearance of the contrast -colour in the field of vision is not, as the Newtonian theory asserts, the result of fa tigue, but of an intens ified activity of the eye, which continues even after the colour impression which gave rise to it has ceased. What is seen on the neutral surface (it will be shown later why we studiously avoid speaking of 'white light') is no outwardly existing colour at all. It is the activity of the eye itself, working in a dream like way from its blood-vessel system, and coming to our consciousness by this means. Here again, just as in the simple oppositi on of light and dark, the perception of coloured after-images is connected with a breaking-down process in the nerve region of the eye, and a corresp onding building-up activity coming from the blood. Only in this case the eye is not affected by simple light, but by light of a definite colouring. The specific destructive process caused by this light is answered with a specific building-up process by the blood. Under certai n conditions we can become dreamily aware of this process which normally does not enter our consciousne ss. In such a case we see the contrasting colour as coloured after-image."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 210 Only by representing the process in this way do we do justice to a fact which completely eludes the onlooker-consciousness - namely, that the eye produces the contrasting colour even while it is still e xposed to the influence of the outer colour. Since this is so, all colours appearing to us in ordinary visi on are already tinged by the subdued light of the opposite colour, pr oduced by the eye itself. One can easily convince oneself of this through the followi ng experiment. Instead of directing the eye, after it has been exposed to a certain colour, to a neutral surface, as previously, gaze at the appropriate contrasting colour . (The first and second coloured surfaces should be so arranged that the former is c onsiderably smaller than the latter.) Then, in the middle of the second surface (and in a fi eld about the size of the first), its own colour appears, with a stri kingly heightened intensity. Here we find the eye producing, as usual, a co ntrast-colour from out of itself, as an after-image, even while its gaze is fixed on the same colour in the outer world. The heightened brilliance within the given field is due to th e addition of the after-image colour to the external colour. The reader may wonder why this phenom enon is not immediately adduced as a decisive proof of the fallacy of the whole Newtonian theory of th e relation of 'white' light to the various colours. Although it doe s in fact offer such a proof, we have good reason for not making this use of it here . Throughout this book it is never our intention to enter into a contest of expl anations, or to defeat one explanation by another. How little this would help will be obvious if we realize that research was certainly not ignorant of the f act that the opposite colour ar ises even when the eye is"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 211 not turned to a white surface. In spite of th is, science did not feel its concept of white light as the sum of all the colours to be an error, since it has succeeded in 'explaining' this phenomenon too, and fitting it into the pr evailing theory. To do so is in thorough accord with spectator-thinking. Our own concern, however, as in all earlier cases, is to replace this thinking with all its 'proofs' and 'explanations' by learning to read in the phenomena themselves. For no other purpose than this the following facts also are now brought forward. * Besides Rudolf Steiner's fundame ntal insight into the spirit ual-physical nature of the growing human being, through which he laid th e basis of a true art of education, he gave advice on many practical points. For ex ample, he indicated how by the choice of a suitable colour environment one can bring a harmonizing influence to bear on extremes of temperament in little chil dren. To-day it is a matter of practical experience that excitable children are quiet ened if they are surrounded with red or red-yellow colours, or wear clothes of th ese colours, whereas inactive, lethargic children are roused to inner movement if they are exposed to the influence of blue or blue-green colours. This psychological reaction of children to colour is not surprising if one knows the role played by the blood in the process of seeing, and how differen tly the soul-life of man is connected with the blood-nerve polar ity of his organism in childhood and in later life. What we have desc ribed as the polar interplay of blood and nerve in the act of sight is not confined to the narrow fiel d of the eye. Just as the nerve processes arising in the retina are con tinued to the optic centre in the cerebrum, so must we look for the origin of the corresponding blood proce ss not in the choroid itself, but in the lower regions of the organism. Wherever, th erefore, the colour red influences the whole nerve system, the blood system as a whole answers with an activity of the metabolism corresponding to th e contrasting colour, green. Similarly it reacts as a whole to a blue-violet affecting the ne rve system, this time with a production corresponding to yellow-orange. The reason why in later years we notice this so little lies in a fact we have repeatedly encountered. The consciousness of the gr own man to-day, through its one-sided attachment to the death-processes in th e nerve region, pays no attention to its connexion with the life-processes centred in the blood system. In this respect the condition of the little child is quite different. Just as the child is more asleep in its nerve system than the grown-up person, it is more awake in its blood system. Hence in all sense-perceptions a child is not so much aware of how the world works on its nerve system as how its blood system res ponds. And so a child in a red environment feels quietened because it experiences, though dimly, how its whole blood system is stimulated to the green production; bluish colours enliven it because it feels its blood answer with a production of light yellowish tones."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 212 From the latter phenomena we see once more the significance of Goethe's arrangement of his Farbenlehre. For we are now able to realize that to turn one's attention to the deeds and sufferings of the inner light means nothing less than to bring to consciousness th e processes of vision which in childhood, though in a dreamlike way, determine the soul's experience of seeing. Through placing his examination of the physiological colours at the beginning of his Farbenlehre, Goethe actually took the path in scientific research to which Thomas Reid pointed in philosophy. By adapting Reid's words we can say that Goethe, in his Farbenlehre, proclaims as a basic principle of a true Optic s: that we must become again as little children if we would reach a ph ilosophy of light and colours. 1 War' nicht das Auge sonnenhaft, Wie koennten wir das Licht erblicken? Lebt' nicht in uns des Gottes eigne Kraft, Wie koennt' uns Goettliches entzucken! 2 Inquiry, VI, 1. The italics are Reid's. 3 Presumably Kant and his school. Schopenhauer was definitely of this opinion. 4 As regards the principle underlying the line of consideration followed here, see the remark made in Chapter V in connexion with Goethe's study of the 'proliferated rose' (p. 76 f .)."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" 213 CHAPTER XVI Seeing as 'Deed' - II The observation of our own visual process, which we began in the last chapter, will serve now to free us from a series of illusory concepts which have been connected by the onlooker-consciousness with th e phenomena brought about by light. There is first the general assumption that light as such is visible. In order to realize that light is itself an invisible agent, we need only consider a fe w self-evident facts - for instance, that for visibility to arise light must always encounter some material resistance in space. This is, in fact, an en counter between light, typifying levity, and the density of the material world, typify ing gravity. Accordingly, wherever visible colours appear we have always to do with light meeting its opposite. Optics, therefore, as a scie nce of the physically perceptib le is never concerned with light alone, but always with lig ht and its opposite together. Th is is actually referred to in Ruskin's statement, quoted in the last ch apter, where he speaks of the need of the 'force' and of the intercepting bodily organ before a science of optics can come into existence. Ruskin's 'light', however, is wh at we have learnt with Goethe to call 'colour', whereas that for which we reserv e the term 'light' is called by him simply 'force'. All this shows how illusory it is to speak of 'white' light as synonymous with simple light, in distinction to 'colour ed' light. And yet this has been customary with scientists from the time of Newton until today, not excluding Newton's critic, Eddington. In fact, white exists visibly for the eye as part of the manifested world, and is therefore properly characterized as a co lour. This is, therefore, how Goethe spoke of it. We shall see presently the special position of white (and likewise of black), as a colour among colours. What matters first of all is to realize that white must be strictly differentiated from light as such, for the function of light is to make visible the material world without itself being visible. To say that light is invisibl e, however, does not mean that it is wholly imperceptible. It is difficult to bring th e perception of light into c onsciousness, for naturally our attention, when we look out in to light-filled space, is claimed by the objects of the illuminated world, in all their manifold colour s and forms. Nevertheless the effect of pure light on our consciousness can be observed during a railway journey, for instance, when we leave a tunnel that has been long enough to bring about a complete adaptation of the eyes to the prevailing da rkness. Then, in the first moments of the lightening of the field of vision, and before any separate objects catch the attention, we can notice how the light itself exercise s a distinctly expanding influence on our consciousness. We feel how the light calls on the consciousness to participate, as it were, in the world outside the body."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" 214 It is possible also to perceive directly the opposite of light. This is easier than the direct perception of light, for in the dark one is not distracted by the sight of surrounding objects. One need only pay attenti on to the fact that , after a complete adapting of the eyes to the da rk, one still retains a distinct experience of the extension of the field of vision of both eyes. We find here, just as in the case of light, that our will is engaged within the eye in a definite way; a systolic effect proceeds from dark, a diastolic effect from light. We have a distinct perception of both, but not of anything 'visible' in the ordinary sense. With regard to our visual e xperience of white and black, it is quite different. We are concerned here with definite conditions of corporeal surfaces, just as with other colours, although the conditions conveying th e impressions of white or black are of a special character. A closer inspection of th ese conditions reveals a property of our act of seeing which has completely escaped scientific observation, but which is of fundamental importance for the understand ing of optical phenomena dynamically. It is well known that a corporeal surface, which we experience as white, has the characteristic of throwing back almost all the light that strikes it, whereas light is more or less completely absorbed by a surface which we experience as black. Such extreme forms of interplay between light and a corporeal surface, however, do not only occur when the light has no particular co lour, but also when a coloured surface is struck by light of the same or opposite colour. In the firs t instance complete reflexion takes place; in the second, co mplete absorption. And both th ese effects are registered by the eye in precisely the same manner as those mentioned before. For example, a red surface in red light looks simply white; a green surface in red light looks black. The usual interpretation of this phenomenon, namely, that it consists in a subjective 'contrast' impression of the eye - a red surf ace in red light looking brighter, a green surface darker, than its surroundings, and thereby causing the illusion of white or black - is a typical onlooke r-interpretation against which there stands the evidence of unprejudiced observation. The reality of the 'w hite' and the 'black' seen in such cases is so striking that a person who has not seen the colours of the objects in ordinary light can hardly be persuaded to believe that they are not 'really' white or black. The fact is that the white and the black that are seen under these conditi ons are just as real as 'ordinary' white and black. When in either instance the eye registers 'white' it registers exactly the same event, namely, th e total reflexion of the light by the surface struck by it. Again, when the eye registers 'b lack' in both cases it re gisters an identical process, namely, total absorption of the light. 1 Seen thus, the phenomenon informs us of the si gnificant fact that ou r eye is not at all concerned with the colour of the light that enters its own cavity, but rather with what happens between the light and the surface on wh ich the light falls. In other words, the phenomenon shows that our process of seeing is not confined to the bodily organ of the eye, but extends into outer space to the point where we experience the visible object to be. 2 "},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" 215 This picture of the visual process, to whic h we have been led here by simple optical observation, was reached by Thomas Reid through his own experience of how, in the act of perceiving the world, man is linked intuitively with it. We remember that he intended in his ph ilosophy to carry ad absurdum the hypothesis that 'the images of the external objects are conveyed by the organs of sense to the brain and are there perceived by the mind'. Common Sense make s Reid speak as follows: 'If any man will shew how the mind may perceive images of the brain, I w ill undertake to shew how it may perceive the most distant objects; for if we give eyes to the mind, to perceive what is transacted at home in its dark chamber, why may we not make the eyes a little longer-sighted? And then we shall have no occasion for that unphilosophical fiction of images in the brain.' (Inq., VI, 12.) Reid proceeds to show this by pointing out, first, that we must onl y use the idea of 'image' for truly visual perceptions; secondly, that the sole place of this image is the background of the eye, and not any part of the nervous system lyi ng beyond; thirdly, th at even this retina- image, as such, does not come to our cons ciousness, but serves only to direct the consciousness to the cause of the image, namely, the external object itself. In what follows we shall deal with an observation which will show how right Reid was in this respect. Those familiar with this observation (well known indeed to those living in the hilly and mountainous districts both here and on th e Continent) know that when distant features of the landscape, in an otherwis e clear and sunlit atmosphere, suddenly seem almost near enough to touch, rainy weather is approaching. Likewise a conspicuous increase in distance, while the sky is s till overcast, foreshadows fine weather. This effect (the customary 'explanation' of wh ich is, as usual, of no avail to us and so need not concern us here) ranks with phe nomena described in optics under the name of 'apparent optical depth', a s ubject we shall discuss more fu lly in the next chapter. It suffices here to state that it is the high er degree of humidity which, by lending the atmosphere greater optical density (wit hout changing its clarity), makes distant objects seem to be closer to the eye, and vi ce versa. (If we could substitute for the air a much lighter gas - say, hydrogen - then the things we see through it would look farther off than they ever do in our atmosphere.) Observations such as these show us that (a) when external light strikes the retina of our eye, our inner light is stimulated to move out of the eye towards it; ( b ) in pressing outward, this inner light meet s with a certain resistance, and the extent of this determines at what distance from the eye our vi sual ray comes to rest as the result of a kind of exhaustion. Just as the outer light r eaches an inner boundary at our retina, so does the inner light meet with an outer boundary, set by the optical density of the medium spread out before the eye, Outer and inner light interpenetrate each other along the whole tract between these tw o boundaries, but normally we are not conscious of this process. We first become conscious of it where our active gaze - that is, the inner light sent forth through the eye - reaches the lim it of its activity. At that point we become aware of the object of our gaze. So here we find confirmed a fact"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" 216 noted earlier, that consciousness - at least at its present state of evolution - arises where for some reason or other our volition conies to rest. * The foregoing observations have served to awaken us in a preliminary way to the fact that an essential part of our act of seeing takes place outside our bodily organ of vision and that our visual experience is determined by what happens out there between our gaze and the medium it has to pene trate. Our next task will be to find out how this part of our visual activity is affected by the properties of the different colours. We shall thereby gain a further insight into the nature of the polarity underlying all colour-phenomena, and this agai n will enable us to move a step further towards becoming conscious of what happens in our act of seeing. We shall start by observing what happens to the two sides of the colour-scale when the optical medium assumes various degrees of density. For the sky to appear blue by day a certain purity of the atmosphere is needed. The more veiled the atmosphere becomes the mo re the blue of the sky turns towards white; the purer and rarer the atmosphere, th e deeper the blue, gradually approaching to black. To mountain climbers and those w ho fly at great heights it is a familiar experience to see the sky assume a deep indigo hue. There can be no doubt that at still higher altitudes the colour of the sky passe s over into violet and ultimately into pure black. Thus in the case of blue the field of vision owes its darken ing to a decrease in the resistance by which our visual ray is met in the optical medium. It is precisely the opposite with yellow. For here, as the density of the medium increases, the colour- effect grows darker by yellow darkening first to orange and then to red, until finally it passes over into complete darkness. This shows that our visual ray is subject to entirely different dynamic effects at the two poles of the colour-scale. At the blue pole, the light ness-effect springs from the resistant medium through which we gaze, a medium under the influence of gravity, while the darkness is provided by the anti-gra vity quality of cosmic space, which as a 'negative' resistance exercises a suction on the eye's inner light. At the yellow pole it is just the reverse. Here, the resistant medi um brings about a darkening of our field of vision, while the lightness-effect springs from a direct meeting of the eye with light, and so with the suctional effect of negative density. Our pursuit of the dynamic causes underlying ou r apperception of the two poles of the colour-scale has led us to a point where it becomes necessary to introduce certain new terms to enable us to go beyond Goet he's general distinction between Finsternis (darkness) and Licht (light). Following Goethe, we ha ve so far used these two terms for what appears both in blue and yellow as the respective light a nd dark ingredients. This distinction cannot satisfy us any mo re. For through our last observations it has become clear that the Finsternis in blue and the Licht in yellow are opposites only in appearance, because they are both caused by Levity, and similarly that the lightening"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" 217 effect in blue and the darkening effect in yellow are both effected by Gravity. Therefore, to distinguish between what a ppertains to the primary polarity, Levity- Gravity, on the one hand, and their visible effects in the secondary polarity of the colours, on the other, we sha ll henceforth reserve the term darkness and, with it, lightness for instances where the perceptible co mponents of the respective colours are concerned, while speaking of Dark and Light where reference is made to the generating primary polarity. * If we are justified in thus tracing the col our-polarity to a polari cally ordered interplay between levity and gravity, we may then pursue the following line of thought. We know from earlier considerati ons that wherever such an interplay between the poles of the primary polarity takes place, we ha ve to do, in geometric terms, with the polarity of sphere and ra dius. We may therefore c onclude that the same characteristics will apply to the way in which the blue of the sky and the yellow of the sunlight are encountered sp atially. Now we need only observe how the blue heavens arch over us spherically, on the one hand, and how the yellow brightness of the sun penetrates the air ray-wise, on the other, in order to realize that this really is so. Having thus established the connexion of th e two poles of the co lour-scale with the spherical and radial structure of space, we are now able to express the Goethean ur- phenomenon in a more dynamic way as follows: On the one hand, we see the blue of the heavens emerging when levity is drawn down by gravity from its primal invisibility into visible, s pherical manifestation. In the yellow of the sunlight, on the other hand, we see gravity, under the infl uence of the sun's levity, gleaming up radially into visibility. The as pect of the two colour-poles which thus arises before us prompts us to replace Goethe's 'lightened Dark' by Earthward-dawning-Levity, and his 'darkened Light' by Heavenward-raying-Gravity. We have now to show that this picture of the dynamic relationship which underlies the appearance of the colour-polarity in the sky is valid also for other cases which are instances of the ur-phenomenon of the genera tion of colour in Goethe's sense, but seem not to lend themselves to the same cosmic interpretation. Such a case is the appearance of yellow and blue when we look through a clouded transparent medium towards a source of light or to a black bac kground. There is no special difficulty here in bringing the appearance of yellow into line with its macrotelluric counterpart, but the appearance of blue re quires some consideration. We have seen that a corporeal surface appear s as black if light striking it is totally absorbed by it. Thus, wherever our eye is met by the colour black, our visual ray is engaged in a process whereby light disa ppears from physical space. Now we need only bring this process into consciousness - as we have tried to do before in similar instances - to realize that wh at happens here to the visual ray is something similar to what it undergoes when it is directed from the earth into cosmic space."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" 218 Note, in this respect, the principle of the mi rror as another instance of the fact that the interplay between light and an illumined surface can have on the visual ray an effect similar to that of external space. For th e optical processes which occur on the surface of a mirror are such that, whilst taking pl ace on a two-dimensional plane, they evoke in our consciousness pictures of exactly th e same nature as if we were looking through the mirror into the space behind it. * The value of our picture of the colour-pol arity is shown furthe r if we observe how natural phenomena based on the same kind of pol arity in other realms of nature fit in with it. We remember that one of Goethe's starting-points in his investigation of the riddle of colour was the observation that of the totality of co lours one part is experienced as 'warm' and the other as 'col d'. Now we can go further and say that the colours of the spherical pole are experienced as cold, those of the radial pole as warm. This corresponds precisely to the polarity of snow-formation and volcanic activity. The former, being the spherically direct ed process, require s physically low temperatures; the latter, being the radi ally directed process, requires high temperatures. Here, once more, we see with what objectivity the human senses register the facts of the outer world. Another realm of phenomena based on a sim ilar polar order is that of electricity. When we studied the negative and positive poles of the vacuum tube, with regard to the polar distribution of radius and sphere , our attention was drawn to the colours appearing on the two electrode s - red at the (positive) anode, blue at the (negative) cathode. Again we find a coincidence with the natural order of the colours. Note how the qualitative dynamic method empl oyed here brings into direct view the relationship between light and electricity, while it precludes the mistake of tracing light processes to those of electricity, as modern science does. Nor are electric processes 'explained' from this point of view merely as variations of light processes. Rather is the relation between light and electricity seen to be based on the fact that all polarities arising perceptibly in nature ar e creations of the same primeval polarity, that of Levity and Gravity. The interplay of Levity and Gravity can take on many different forms which are distinguished essent ially by differences in cosmic age. Thus the colour-polarity in its primal form, made manifest by the heavens, differs as much from the corresponding polarity shown by the vacuum tube, as does the lightning in the heights from the electric spark. * With the aid of what we have learnt he re concerning outer light-processes we shall turn once more to the activ ity of our own inner light. We may expect by now that our eye is fitte d with two modes of seeing activity, polar to each other, and that the way in which they come into operation depends on whether"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" 219 the interplay of positive and negative density outside the eye leads to the appearance of the blue-violet or of the yellow-red side of the col our-scale. Such a polarity in the activity of the eye can indeed be established. Along with it goes a significant functional difference between the two eyes ( not unlike that shown of the two hands). To observe this we need simply to comp are the two eyes of a person in a photograph by covering alternately the right and the left half of the face. Nearly always it will be found that the right eye looks out clearly into the world w ith an active expression, and the left eye with a much gentler one, almost held back. Artists are well aware of this asymmetry, as of others in the human count enance, and are careful to depict it. An outstanding example is Raphael's Sistine Madonna, where in the eyes and whole countenance both of Mother and Child this asymmetry can be studied in a specially impressive way. Inner observation leads to a corresponding experience. A convenient method is to exercise the two eyes in complete darkness, in the following way. One eye is made to look actively into the space in front of it, as if it would pierce the darkness with its visual ray, while the activity of the other eye is held back, so that its gaze rests only superficially, as it were, on the darkness in front of it. Experience shows that most people find it natural to give the active note to the right eye, and the passive note to the left. Once one has grown conscious of this natura l difference between the two eyes, it is quite easily detected while one is looking normally into the light-filled environment. We thereby realize that for the two eyes to act differently in this way is the usual thing. As an instance where this fact is well obser ved and effectively made use of, that of shooting may be mentioned here, especially shooting at flying game. Those who train in this sport learn to make a completely di fferent use of the two eyes in sighting the target. The naturally more active eye - only once in about fifty cases is it the left - is called by them the 'master-eye'. Whilst the less actively gazing eye is usually employed for surveying the field as a whole into which the target is expected to enter, the master-eye is used for making active c ontact with the target itself ('throwing' oneself on the target 'through' the eye). One further observation may be added. If one l ooks with rested eyes and in very faint daylight (perhaps in the early morning on awakening) at a white surface, while opening and closing the eyes alternately, then the white surface looks faintly reddish to the 'master-eye', and faintly bluish to the other. *"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" 220 Following the lines of our treatment of after-images in the last chapter, we will next inquire into the anatomical and physio logical basis of the two opposite sight- activities. In the previous instance we found this in the polarity of nerve and blood. This time we must look for it in a certain tw ofold structure of the eye itself. We shall best perceive this by watching the 'becoming' of the eye, thus again following a method first shown by Goethe. Fig. 11 shows the human eye in different st ages of its embryonic formation. The eye is clearly seen to consist of two parts esse ntially different in or igin. Growing out from the interior of the embryonic organism is a structure that is gradually pushed in, and in its further development becomes the entire posterior part of th e eye, destined to carry its life-imbued functions. A second inde pendent part grows towards this from outside; this is at first a mere thickening of the embryonic skin formation, but later it loos ens itself and presses forward into the interior of the cup-shaped st ructure. It is gradually en closed by this, and evolves finally into that part of the finished eye which embodies the optical apparatus functioning according to purely physical laws. This series of forms shows that in th e embryonic formation of the eye we are confronted with two processes, one of spherical, and the other of radial orientation. Consequently the two parts of the eye ar e differentiated in such a way that the posterior part, which has grow n forth radially from the embryonic organism, as the life-filled element represents the sulphur-pole of the total eye, while the anterior part, with its much more crystalline nature , having grown spherically towards the organism, represents the eye's salt-pole. Closer inspection into the c onnexion of the two visual activ ities of the eye with its basic corporeal part s reveals that here , at the outermost boundary of the human organism, we encounter once more that pecu liar reversal of func tions which we have already several times met in va rious realms of nature. For th e anterior part of the eye - its salt-pole - which has come into being through a spherically directed formative process, seems to be the one through whic h we exercise the perceptive activity streaming out radially from the eye, whilst the posterior part - th e eye's sulphur-pole -"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" 221 which has come into being through radially directed formative action, serves that form of seeing which is more receptive a nd is carried out in a plane-wise manner. Considerations of this kind, a nd they alone, enable us also to draw true comparisons between the different sense-organs. Take th e organ of hearing. Usually the ear is assumed to fill the same role in the field of hearing as does the eye in the field of seeing. In fact the ear corresponds to only one half of the ey e; the other half must be looked for in the larynx. In other words, the two parts of the eye ar e represented in the realm of hearing by two separate organs, ear and larynx. Speaking fr om the aspect of metamorphosis, the vital part of our eye may be regarded as our 'light-ear'; the crystalline part, as our 'light-larynx'. In or der to come consciously to a perception of sight we must 'listen' to the 'deeds and suffe rings' of light, while at the same time we meet them with the help of the 'speaking' of our inner light. So mething similar holds good for hearing. In fact, observation reveals th at we take in no impression of hearing unless we accompany it with an activity of our larynx, even though a silent one. The significance of this fact for the total function of hearing will occupy us more fully later. * Our insight into the polar nature of visu al activity will enable us now to link the external interplay of Ligh t and Dark - to which the physical colours owe their existence - to that play of forces whic h we ourselves set in motion when our eye meets the world of colours in their polar differentiation. We established earlier that in the cold colour s the role of darkness belongs to the pole of levity or negative density, and the role of lightness to the pole of gravity or positive density, whereas in the case of the warm colours the roles are reversed. Let us now unite with this the insight we have meanwhile gained into the two kinds of activity in seeing - the receptive, 'left-eyed' and the radi ating, 'right-eyed' - which mediate to us the experience of the positive or negative density of space spread out before our eyes. Taking together the results of outer and inner observation, we can express the polarity ruling in the realm of colour as follows. If lightness and darkness as elements of col our, meet us in such a way that lightness, by reason of its positive density, calls fo rth 'left-eyed' activity, and darkness, by reason of its negative density, 'right-eyed' activity, then our soul receives the impression of the colour blue and colours related to blue. If lightness and darkness meet us so that we see the former in a 'r ight-eyed', and the latter in a 'left-eyed' way, then we experience this as the presence of yellow and the colours related to it. The reason why we usually fail to observe th e different kinds of interplay of the two modes of seeing, when we perceive one or other of the two cate gories of colour, is because in ordinary sight both eyes exerci se each of the two activities without our becoming aware which is the leading one in a particular eye. If, however, one has come to a real experience of the inner polarity of the visual act, one needs only a little"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" 222 practice to realize the distinc tion. For example, if one looks at the blue sky, notably at noon-time, on the side away from the sun, or at the morning or evening sky, shining yellow and red, one quickly becomes conscious of how our eyes take hold of the particular contribution which Light and Dark make to one or other of the two colour appearances. * In the natural course of our argument we ha d to keep at first to the appearance of colours as they come freely before us in space. The results we have obtained, however, hold good equally well for the perman ent tints of material objects, as the following example will show. A fact known to science is that red and bl ue surface colours, when illumined by light of steadily diminishing intensity, are seen to reverse their normal ratio of brightness. This phenomenon can be seen in nature, if, for instance, one observes a bed of blue and red flowers in the fading evening light and compares the impression with that which the same flowers make in bright daylight. If the phenomenon is reproduced artificially, the actual trans ition from one state to the ot her can be clearly observed. The easiest way is to place a red and a blue surface side by side under an electric light whose intensity can be gradually lessened by means of a sliding resistance. Here, as much as in the natural phenomenon, our r eason finds it difficult to acknowledge that the surface gleaming in a whitish sheen should be the one which ordinarily appears as darkling blue, and that the one disappeari ng into darkness should be the surface which normally presents itself as radiant red. This riddle is readily solved if we apply what we have learnt about the particular shares of lightness and darkness in these two colours, and if we link this up with the respective forms of seeing exercised by our two eyes. To the dim light, clearly, our eyes will respond more with the 'left-eyed' than with the 'right-eyed' form of vision. Now we know that it is 'left-eyed' vision which is roused by the lightness-component in blue and the darkness-component in red. It is only to be expected, therefore, that these elements should become conspicuous wh en in the dim light our seeing is mainly 'left-eyed'. This solution of the problem makes us realize further, that the laws which Goethe first found for the coming into appear ance of colours freely hovering in space are indeed applicable to the fixed material colours as well. 1 It will be well to remember here the discussion of our experience of temperature through the sense of warmth in Chapter VIII (p. 134 f .). 2 Along these lines the true solution of the problem of the so-called coloured shadows will be found, Goethe studied this without finding, however, a satisfactory answer. CHAPTER XVII"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" 223 Optics of the Doer Three basic concepts form the foundation for the present-day scien tific description of a vast field of optical phenomena, among th em the occurrence of the spectral colours as a result of light passing through a transp arent medium of prismatic shape. They are: 'optical refraction', 'light-ray', and 'light-velocity' - the latter two serving to explain the first. In a science of optics which seeks its foundation in the intercourse between man's own visual activity and the doings and sufferings of light, these three concepts must needs undergo a decisive cha nge, both in their meaning and in their value for the description of the relevant optical phenomena. For they are all purely kinematic concepts typical of the onlooker-way of conceivi ng things - concepts, that is, to which nothing corresponds in th e realm of the actual phenomena. Our next task, therefore, will be, where po ssible, to fill these concepts with new meaning, or else to replace them by other concepts read from the actual phenomena. Once this is done the way will be free fo r the development of the picture of the spectrum phenomenon which is in true accord with the Goethean conception of Light and Colour. * The first to be brought in this sense under our examination is the c oncept of the 'light- ray'. In present-day optics this concept signifies a geometrical line of infinitely small width drawn, as it were, by the light in space, wh ile the cone or cyli nder of light actually filling the space is described as being com posed of innumerable such rays. In the same way the object producing or reflecti ng light is thought of as composed of innumerable single points from which the light-rays emerge. All descriptions of optical processes are based upon this conception. Obviously, we cannot be satisfied with such a reduction of wholes into single geometrically describable parts, followed by a reassembling of these parts into a whole. For in reality we have to do with realms of space uniformly filled with light, whether conical or cylindrical in form, which arise through certain boundaries being set to the light. In optical research we have therefore always to do with pictures, spatially bounded. Thus what comes before our consciousness is determined equally by the light calling forth the picture, and by the unlit space bordering it. Remembering the results of our earlier study, we must say further of such a light- filled realm that it lacks the quality of visi bility and therefore has no colour, not even white. Goethe and other 'readers', such as Reid and Ruskin, tried continually to visualize what such a light-fil led space represents in reality. Hence they directed their attention first to those spheres where light manifests its form-creative activity, as in the moulding of the organ of sight in anim al or man, or in the creation of the many forms of the plant kingdom - and only then gave their mind to the purely physical"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" 224 light-phenomena. Let us use the same method to form a picture of a light-filled space, and to connect this with the ideas we have previously gained on the co-operation in space of levity and gravity. Suppose we have two similar plant-seeds in germ; and let one lie in a space filled with light, the other in an unlit space. From the different behaviour of the two seeds we can observe certain differences between the two regions of space. We note that within the light-filled region the spiritual archetype of the plant belonging to the seed is helped to manifest itself physically in space, whereas in the dark region it receives no such aid. For in the latter the physical plant, even if it grows, does not develop its proper forms. This tells us, in accordance with what we have learnt earlier, that in the two cases there is a different relation of sp ace to the cosmically distant, all-embracing plane. Thus inside and outside the light-regi on there exists a quite different relation of levity and gravity - and this relation change s abruptly at the bounda ries of the region. (This fact will be of especial importance fo r us when we come to examine the arising of colours at the boundary of Light and Da rk, when light passes through a prism.) * After having replaced the customary concep t of the light-bundle composed of single rays by the conception of two dynamically polar realms of sp ace bordering each other, we turn to the examination of what is going on dynamically inside these realms. This will help us to gain a proper concept of the propagation of light through space. In an age when the existence of a measurab le light-velocity seems to belong to the realm of facts long since e xperimentally proved; when science has begun to measure the universe, using the magnitude of this ve locity as a constant , valid for the whole cosmos; and when entire branches of science have been founded on results thus gained, it is not easy, and yet it cannot be avoided, to proclaim that neither has an actual velocity of light ever been meas ured, nor can light as such ever be made subject to such measurement by optical means - and that, moreover, light, by its very nature, forbids us to conceive of it as possessing any finite velocity. With the last assertion we do not mean to say that there is nothing going on in connexion with the appearance of optical phe nomena to which the concept of a finite velocity is applicable. Only, what is propa gated in this way is not the entity we comprise under the concept of 'light'. Our next task, therefore, will be to create a proper distinction between wh at moves and what does not move spatially when light is active in the physical world. Once more an historical retrospect will help us to establish our own standpoint with regard to the existing theories. The first to think of light as possessing a finite velocity was Galileo, who also made the first, though unsuccessful, attempt to measure it. Equally unsuccessful were attempts of a similar nature made soon afterwards by members of the Accademia del Cimento. In both cases the obvious procedure was to produce regular flashes of light"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" 225 and to try to measure the time which el apsed between their production and their observation by some more or less distant observer. Still, th e conviction of the existence of such a velocity was so deeply ingrained in the minds of men that, when later observations succeeded in establishing a finite magnitu de for what seemed to be the rate of the light's movement through space, these observations were hailed much more as the quantitative value of this movement than as pr oof of its existence, which was already taken for granted. A clear indication of man's state of mind in regard to this question is given in the following passage from Huygens's famous TraitÃ© de la LumiÃ ̈re, by which the world was first made acquainted with the concept of light as a sort of undulatory movement. 'One cannot doubt that light consists in the movement of a certain substance. For if one considers its production one finds that he re on the earth it is chiefly produced by fire and flame, which without doubt contain bodies in ra pid motion, for they dissolve and melt numberless other bodies. Or, if one co nsiders its effects, one sees that light collected, for instance, by a concave mirror ha s the power to heat like fire, i.e. to separate the parts of the bodies; this assuredly points to movement, at least in true philosophy in which one traces all natural activity to m echanical causes. In my opinion one must do this, or quite give up all hope of ever grasping anything in physics.' In these words of Huygens it must strike us how he first provides an explanation for a series of phenomena as if this expl anation were induced from the phenomena themselves. After he has drawn quite definite conclusions from it, he then derives its necessity from quite other principles - namely, from a certai n method of thinking, accepting this as it is, unquestioned a nd unalterably established. We are here confronted with an 'unlogic' characteris tic of human thinking during its state of isolation from the dynamic substratum of th e world of the senses, an unlogic which one encounters repeatedly in scientific ar gumentation once one has grown aware of it. In circles of modern thinkers where such awareness prevails (and they are growing rapidly to-day) the term 'proof of a foregone conclusion' has been coined to describe this fact. 1 'Proof of a foregone conclusion' is indeed the verdict at which one arrives in respect of all the observations con cerned with the velocity of light - whether of existing phenomena detectable in the sky or of terre strial phenomena produced artificially - if one studies them with the attitude of mind represented by the child in Hans Andersen's story. In view of the seriousness of the matter it will not be out of place if we discuss them here as briefly as possible, one by one. 2 The relevant observations fall into tw o categories: observations of certain astronomical facts from which the existence of a finite velocity of light and its magnitude as an absolute property of it has been inferred; and terrestrial experiments which permitted direct observation of a process of propagation connected with the"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 226 establishment of light in space resulting in the measurement of its speed. To the latter category belong the experiments of Fizeau (1849) and Foucault (1850) as well as the Michelson-Morley experiment with its implications for Einstein's Theory of Relativity. The former category is represen ted by Roemer's observations of certain apparent irregularities in th e times of revolution of one of Jupiter's moons (1676), and by Bradley's investigation into the reason for the apparent rhythmic changes of the positions of the fixed stars (1728). We shall start with the terrestrial observations , because in their case alone is the entire path of the light surveyable, and what is measured therefore is something appertaining with certainty to every po int of the space which spreads between the source of the light and the observer. For th is reason textbooks quite rightly say that only the results drawn from these terres trial observations have the value of empirically observed facts. (The interpre tation given to these facts is another question.) Now, it is a common feature of all these e xperiments that by nece ssity they are based on an arrangement whereby a light-beam can be made to appear and disappear alternately. In this respect there is no di fference between the first primitive attempts made by Galileo and the Academicians, and the ingeniously devised experiments of the later observers, whether they operate wi th a toothed wheel or a rotating mirror. It is always a flash of light - and how could it be otherwis e? - which is produced at certain regular intervals and used for determining the speed of propagation. Evidently what in all these cases is measured is the speed with which a beam of light establishes itself in space. Of what happens within the beam, once it is established, these observations tell nothing at all. The proof they are held to give of the existence of a finite speed of light, as such, is a 'proof of a foregone conclusion'. All they tell us is that the beam's front, at the moment when this beam is first established, travels through space with a finite velo city and that the rate of this movement is such and such. And they tell us nothing at al l about other regions of the cosmos. That we have to do in these observations with the speed of th e light-front only, and not of the light itself, is a fact fully acknowledged by modern physical optics. Since Lord Rayleigh first discussed this matter in the eighties of the la st century, physicists have learnt to distinguish between the 'wave-velocity' of the light itself and the velocity of an 'impressed peculiarity', the so-called 'group-velocity', and it has been acknowledged that only the la tter has been, and can be, directly measured. There is no possibility of inferring from it the value of the 'wave-velocity' unless one has a complete knowledge of the properties of the medium through which the 'groups' travel. Nevertheless, the modern mind allo ws itself to be convinced that light possesses a finite velocity a nd that this has been establ ished by actual measurement. We feel reminded here of Eddington's co mment on Newton's famous observations: 'Such is the glamour of a historic al experiment.' (Chapter XIV.) 3 "},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" 227 Let us now turn to Roemer and Bradley. In a certain sense Roemer's observations and even those of Bradley rank together with the terrestrial measurements. For Roemer used as optical signals the appearance and di sappearance of one of Jupiter's moons in the course of its revolution round the planet; thus he worked with light- flashes, as the experimental investigations do. Hence, als o, his measurements were concerned - as optical science acknowledges - with group-velocity only. In fact, even Bradley's observations, although he was the only one who operated with continuous light- phenomena, are exposed to the charge th at they give information of the group- velocity of light, and not of its wave-v elocity. However, we shall ignore these limitations in both cases, because there are quite other factors which invalidate the proofs they are held to give, and to gain a cl ear insight into these factors is of special importance for us. Roemer observed a difference in the length of time during which a certain moon of Jupiter was occulted by the planet's body, and found that this difference underwent regular changes coincident with the cha nges in the earth's position in relation to Jupiter and the sun. Seen from the sun, the earth is once a year in conjunction with Jupiter, once in opposition to it. It seemed obvious to explain the time-lag in the moon's reappearance, when the earth was on the far side of the sun, by the time the light from the moon needed to cover the distance marked by the two extreme positions of the earth - that is, a distance equa l to the diameter of the earth's orbit. On dividing the observed interval of time by th e accepted value of this distance, Roemer obtained for the velocity of li ght a figure not far from the one found later by terrestrial measurements. We can here leave out of account the fact that Roemer 's reasoning is based on the assumption that the Copernican conception of the relative movements of the members of our solar system is the valid conception, an as sumption which, as later considerations will show, cannot be upheld in a science which strives for a truly dynamic understanding of the world. For the change of aspect which becomes necessary in this way does not invalidate Roemer's observation as such; it rules out only the customary interpre tation of it. Freed from all hypothetical by-thought, Roemer's observation tells us, first, that the time taken by a flash of light travelling from a cosmic light-source to reach the ear th varies to a measurable extent, and, secondly, that this difference is bound up w ith the yearly changes of the earth's position in relation to the sun a nd the relevant planetary body. We leave equally out of account the fact that our considerations of the nature of space in Chapter XII render it impermissible to conceive of cosmic space as something 'across' which light (or any ot her entity) can be regarded as travelling this or that distance in this or that time. What matters to us here is the validity of the conclusions drawn from Roemer's discovery within the framework of thought in which they were made. Boiled down to its purely empirical content, Roemer's observation tells us solely and simply that within the earth's cosmic orbit light-flashes travel with a certain"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" 228 measurable speed. To regard this information as automatically valid, firstly for light which is continuously present, and secondl y for everywhere in the universe, rests again on nothing but a foregone conclusion. Precisely the same criticism applies to Bradley's observation, and to an even higher degree. What Bradley discovered is the fact that the apparent direction in which we see a fixed star is dependent on the direct ion in which the earth moves relatively to the star, a phenomenon known under the na me of 'aberration of light'. This phenomenon is frequently brought to st udents' understanding by means of the following or some similar analogy. Imagine that a machine-gun in a fixed positio n has sent its projectile right across a railway-carriage so that both the latter's walls are pierced. If the train is at rest, the position of the gun could be determined by sighting through the shot-holes made by the entrance and exit of the bu llet. If, however, the train is moving at high speed, it will have advanced a certain distance during the time taken by the projectile to cross the carriage, and the point of exit will be nearer the rear of the carriage than in the previous case. Let us now think of an obser ver in the train who, while ignorant of the train's movement, undertook to determine the gun's position by considering the direction of the line connecting the two hol es. He would necessar ily locate the gun in a position which, compared with its true position, would seem to have shifted by some distance in the direction of the tr ain's motion. On the other hand, given the speed of the train, the angl e which the line connecting th e two holes forms with the true direction of the course of the proj ectile - the so-called angle of aberration - provides a measure of the speed of the projectile. Under the foregone conclusion th at light itself has a definite velocity, and that this velocity is the same throughout the univer se, Bradley's observation of the aberration of the stars seemed indeed to make it possi ble to calculate this velocity from the knowledge of the earth's own speed and the angle of aberration. This angle could be established by comparing the different direct ions into which a telescope has to be turned at different times of the year in or der to focus a particular star. But what does Bradley's observation tell us, once we exclude all foregone conclusions? As the above analogy helps towards an unders tanding of the con cept of aberration, it will be helpful also to determine the limits up to which we are allowed to draw valid conclusions from the supposed occurrence itself. A mind which is free from all preconceived ideas will not i gnore the fact that the proj ectile, by being forced to pierce the wall of the carriage, suffers a considerable diminution of its speed. The projectile, therefore, passes through the carriage with a sp eed different from its speed outside. Since, however, it is the speed from hole to hole which determines the angle of aberration, no conclusion can be drawn from the latter as to the original velocity of the projectile. Let us assume the imaginary case that the projectile was shot forth from the gun with infinite velocity, and that the slowing-down e ffect of the wall was great enough to produce a finite speed of the usual magnit ude, then the effect on the"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" 229 position of the exit hole would be precisely the same as if the projectile had moved all the time ' with this speed and not been slowed down at all. Seeing things in this light, the scientific A ndersen child in us is roused to exclaim: 'But all that Bradley's observation informs us of , with certainty is a finite velocity of the optical process going on inside the telescope! ' Indeed, if someone should claim with good reason (as we shall do later on) that light's own velocity is infinite, and (as we shall not do) that the dynamic situation set up in the telescope had the effect of slowing down the light to the measured velocity - there is nothing in Bradley's observation which could disp rove these assertions. * Having thus disposed of the false conclu sions drawn by a kinematically orientated thinking from the various observations a nd measurements of the velocity which appears in connexion with light, we can carry on our own studies undisturbed. Two observations stand before us representing empiri cally established facts: one, that in so far as a finite velocity has been measur ed or calculated from other observations, nothing is known about the existence or magn itude of such a velocity except within the boundaries of the dynamic realm consti tuted by the earth's presence in the universe; the other, that this velocity is a 'group'-velocity, that is, the velocity of the front of a light-beam in process of establishm ent. Let us see what these two facts have to tell us when we regard them as letters of the 'word' which light inscribes into the phenomenal world as an indication of its own nature. Taking the last-named fact first, we sha ll make use of the following comparison to help us realize how little we are justified in drawing from observations of the front speed of a light-beam any conclusions con cerning the kinematic conditions prevailing in the interior of the beam itself. Imagine the process of constructing a tunnel, with all the efforts and time needed for cutting its passage through the re sisting rock. When the tunnel is finished the ac tivities necessary to its produc tion are at an end. Whereas these continue for a limited time only, they leave behind them permanent traces in the existence of the tunnel, which one can descri be dynamically as a de finite alteration in the local conditions of the earth's gravity. No w, it would occur to no one to ascribe to the tunnel itself, as a lasting quality, the speed with which it had been constructed. Yet something similar happens when, after observing the velocity required by light to lay hold on space, this velocity is then attribut ed to the light as a quality of its own. It was reserved for a mode of thought that c ould form no concept of the real dynamic of Light and Dark, to draw conclusions as to the qualities of light from experiences obtained through observing its origin al spreading out into space. To speak of an independently existing space within which light could move forward like a physical body, is, after what we have le arnt about space, altogether forbidden. For space in its relevant structure is itself but a result of a partic ular co-ordination of levity and gravity or, in other words, of Light and Dark. What we found earlier about the qualities of the two polar spaces now leads us to conceive of them as"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" 230 representative of two li miting conditions of veloc ity: absolute contraction representing zero velocity; absolute expansi on, infinite velocity (each in its own way a state of 'rest'). Thus any motion with fi nite velocity is a mean between these two extremes, and as such the result of a part icular co-ordination of levity and gravity. This makes it evident that to speak of a velocity taking its course in space, whether with reference to light or to a physical body in motion, is something entirely unreal. Let us now see what we are really told by the number 186,000 miles a second, as the measure of the speed with which a light-im pulse establishes itself spatially. In the preceding chapter we learnt that the earth's fi eld of gravity offers a definite resistance to our visual ray. What is true for the inner light holds good equally for the outer light. Using an image from another dynamic stratum of nature we can say that light, while appearing within the field of gravit y, 'rubs' itself on this. On the magnitude of this friction depends the velocity with whic h a light-impulse establishes itself in the medium of the resisting gravity. Whereas lig ht itself as a manifestation of levity possesses infinite velocity, this is for ced down to the known finite measure by the resistance of the earth's field of gravit y. Thus the speed of light which has been measured by observers such as Fizeau and Foucault reveals itself as a function of the gravitational constant of the earth, and hence has validity for this sphere only. 1 The same is true for Roemer's and Bradley's observations, none of which, after what we have stated earlier, contradict s this result. On the contrary, seen from this viewpoint, Roemer's discovery of the light's travelling with finite speed within the cosmic realm marked by the earth's orbit provides an im portant insight into the dynamic conditions of this realm. * Among the experiments undertaken with the ai m of establishing the properties of the propagation of light by direct measurem ents, quoted earlier, we mentioned the Michelson-Morley experiment as having a sp ecial bearing on Einstein's conceptual edifice. It is the one which has formed the foundation of that (earlier) part of Einstein's theory which he himself called th e Special Theory of Relativity. Let us see what becomes of this foundation - and with it the conceptual edif ice erected upon it - when we examine it against the background of what we have found to be the true nature of the so-calle d velocity of light. It is generally known that modern ideas of light seemed to call for something (Huygens's 'certain substance') to act as b earer of the movement attributed to light. This led to the conception of an impondera ble agency capable of certain movements, and to denote this agency the Greek word ether was borrowed. (How this word can be used again to-day in conformity with its actual significance will be shown in the further course of our discussions.) Neve rtheless, all endeavours to find in the existence of such an ether a means of e xplaining wide fields of natural phenomena were disappointed. For the more exact concepts one tried to form of the characteristics of this ether, the greater the contradictions became."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" 231 One such decisive contradiction arose wh en optical means were used to discover whether the ether was somethi ng absolutely at rest in space, through which physical bodies moved freely, or whether it shared in their movement. Experiments made by Fizeau with running water seemed to prove the one view, those of Michelson and Morley, involving the movement of the ear th, the other view. In the celebrated Michelson-Morley experiment the velocity of light was shown to be the same, in whatever direction, relative to the earth's own motion, it was measured. This apparent proof of the absolute constancy of lig ht-velocity - which seemed, however, to contradict other observations - induced Einstein to do away with the whole assumption of a bearer of the movement underlying light, whether the bearer were supposed to be at rest or itself in motion. Instead, he divested the concepts of space and time, from which that of velocity is usually derived, of the absoluteness hitherto attributed to them, with the result that in his theory time has come to be conceived as part of a four-dimensional 'space-time continuum'. In reality the Michelson-Morley experime nt presents no problem requiring such labours as those of Einstein for its soluti on. For by this experiment nothing is proved beyond what can in any event be known - name ly, that the velocity of the propagation of a light- impulse is constant in all directions, so long as the measuring is confined to regions where the density of terrestrial sp ace is more or less the same. With the realization of this truth, however, Einste in's Special Theory loses its entire foundation. All that remains to be said about it is that it was a splendid endeavour to solve a problem which, rightly considered, does not exist. 1 * Now that we have realized that it is inad missible to speak of light as consisting of single rays, or to ascribe to it a finite velocity, the concept of the refraction of light, as understood by optics to-day and employed for the explanation of the spectrum, also becomes untenable. Let us find out what we must put in its place. The phenomenon which led the onlooker-consci ousness to form the idea of optical refraction has been known since early times. It consists in the fact, surprising at first sight, that an object, such as a coin, which lies at the bottom of a vessel hidden from an observer by the rim, becomes visible when the vessel is filled with water. Modern optics has explained this by assuming that from the separate points of the floor of the ve ssel light-rays go out to all sides, one ray falling in the direction of the eye of the observer. Hence, because of the positions of eye and intercepting rim there are a number of points from which no rays can reach the eye. One such point is represented by the coin (P in Fig. 12a). Now if the vessel is filled with water, light-rays emerging from it are held to be refracted, so that rays from the points hitherto invisi ble also meet the eye, whic h is still in its original position. The eye itself is not conscious of this 'break' in the light-rays,"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" 232 because it is accustomed to 'project' all li ght impressions rectilinearly out into space (Fig. 12b.). Hence, it sees P in the position of P'. This is thought to be the origin of the impression that the whole bo ttom of the vessel is raised. This kind of explanation is quite in li ne with the peculiarity of the onlooker- consciousness, noted earlier, to attribute an optical il lusion to the eye's way of working, while charging the mind with the task of clearing up the illusion. In reality it is just the reverse. Since the intellect can form no other idea of the act of seeing than that this is a passive process taking place sole ly within the eye, it falls, itself, into illusion. How great is this illusion we see from the fact that the intellect is finally obliged to make the eye somehow or other 'project' into space the impressions it receives - a process lacking a ny concrete dynamic content. Once more, it is not our task to replace this way of 'explaining' the phenomenon by any other, but rather to combine the phenom enon given here with others of kindred nature so that the theory contained in them can be read from them direct. One other such phenomenon is that of so-called appa rent optical depth, which an observer encounters when looking through transparent media of varying optical density. What connects the two is the fact that the rate of the alteration of depth, and the rate of change of the direction of light, are the same for the same media. In present-day optics this phenomenon is expl ained with reference to the former. In proceeding like this, optical science makes the very mistake which Goethe condemned in Newton, saying that a compli cated phenomenon was made the basis, and the simpler derived from the complex. For of these two phenomena, the simpler, since it is independent of any secondary condition, is the on e showing that our experience of depth is dependent on the de nsity of the optical medium. The latter phenomenon we met once before, though wit hout reference to its quantitative side, when in looking at a landscape we found how our experiences of depth change in conformity with alterations in atmospheric conditions. This, then, served to make us aware that the way we apprehend things optical ly is the result of an interplay between our visual ray and the medium outside us which it meets."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" 233 It is exactly the same when we look thr ough a vessel filled with water and see the bottom of it as if raised in level. This is in no sense an optical illusion; it is the result of what takes place objectively and dynami cally within the medium, when our eye- ray passes through it. Only our intellect is under an illusion when, in the case of the coin becoming visible at the bottom of the vesse l, it deals with the coin as if it were a point from which an individual ray of light went out.. .. etc., inst ead of conceiving the phenomenon of the raising of the vessel's bottom as one indivisible whole, wherein the coin serves only to link our attention to it. * Having thus cleared away the kinematic interpretation of the coin-in-the-bowl phenomenon, we may pass on to discuss th e optical effect through which the so- called law of refraction was first establishe d in science. Instead of picturing to ourselves, as is usually done, light-rays wh ich are shifted away from or towards the perpendicular at the border-plane between tw o media of different optical properties, we shall rather build up the picture as light itself designs it into space. We have seen that our inner light, as well as the outer light, suffers a certain hindrance in passing through a physical medium - even such as the earth's gravity- field. Whilst we may not describe this retard ation, as is usually done, in terms of a smaller velocity of light itself within the denser medium, we may rightly say that density has the effect of lessening the intens ity of the light. (It is the time required for the initial establishment of a light-filled realm which is greater within such a medium than outside it.) Now by its very nature the intensity of light ca nnot be measured in spatial terms. Yet there is a phenomenon by which the decrease of the inner intensity of the light becomes spatially apparent and thus spatially measurable. It consists in the alteration undergone by the aperture of a cone of light when passing from one optical medium to another. If one sets in the path of a luminous cone a glass-walled trough filled with water, then, if both water and surroundi ng air are slightly clouded, the cone is seen to make a more acute angle within the water than out side it (Fig. 13). Here in an external phenomenon we meet the same weakening in the light's tendency to expand that we recognized in the shortening of our expe rience of depth on looking through a dense medium. Obviously, we expect the externally observable narrowing of the light-cone and the subjectively experienced change of optical depth to show the same ratio. In order to compare the rate of expansi on of a luminous cone inside and outside water, we must measure by how much less th e width of the cone increases within the water than it does outside. (To be compar able, the measurements must be based upon the same distances on the edge of the cone, because this is the length of the way the light actually travels.) In Fi g. 13 this is shown by the two distances, a-b and a'-b'. Their ratio is the same as that by which th e bottom of a vessel a ppears to be raised when the vessel is filled with water (4:3)."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" 234 Thus by means of pure observation we have arrived at nothing less than what is known to physical optics as Snell's Law of Refraction. This law was itself the result of pure observation, but was clot hed in a conceptual form de void of reality. In this form it states that a ray of light in trans ition between two media of different densities is refracted at their boundary surface so that the ratio of the angle which is formed by the ray in either medium with a line at ri ght angles to the bounda ry surface is such that the quotient of the sines of both angles is for these media a constant factor. In symbols sin Î± / sin Î² = c . It will be clear to the reader familiar with trigonometry that this ratio of the two sines is nothing else but the ratio of the two distances which served us as a measure for the respective apertures of the cone. But whereas the measurement of these two distances is concerned with something quite real (since they expre ss an actual dynamic alteration of the light), the measuring of the angle between the ray of light and the perpendicular is founded on nothing real. It is now clear that the concept of the ray, as it figures in the usual picture of refracti on, is in reality the boundary between the luminous space and its surroundings. Evidently the concept of the perpendicular on the boundary between the two media is in it self a complete abst raction, since nothing happens dynamically in its direction. To a normal human understanding it is incomp rehensible why a ray of light should be related to an external geomet rical line, as stated by the law of refraction in its usual"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":" 235 form. Physical optics, in order to explain refraction, had therefore to resort to light- bundles spatially diffused, and by use of s undry purely kinematic concepts, to read into these light-bundles certain processes of motion, which are not in the least shown by the phenomenon itself. In contrast to th is, the idea that the boundary of a luminous cone is spatially displaced when its expa nsion is hindered by an optical medium of some density, and that the measure of this displacement is equal to the shortening of depth which we experience in looking through this medium, is dire ctly evident, since all its elements are taken from observation. * From what we have here found we may expect that in order to explain the numerical relationships between natural phenomena (with which science in the past has been solely concerned), we by no means require the artificial theories to which the onlooker in man, confined as he is to abst ract thinking, has been unavoidably driven. Indeed, to an observer who tr ains himself on the lines indi cated in this book, even the quantitative secrets of nature will become object s of intuitive j udgment, just as Goethe, by developing this organ of unde rstanding, first found access to nature's qualitative secrets. (The change in our conception of number which this entails will be shown at a later stag e of our discussions.) 1 Compare with this our account in Chapter X of the rise of the atomistic-kinematic interpretation of heat. 2 The following critical study leaves, of course, completely untouched our recognition of the devotion which guided the respective observers in their work, and of the ingenuity with which some of their observations were devised and carried out. 3 The assumption is that the wave-velocity differs from the group-velocity, if at all, by a negligible amount. 4 Once this is realized there can be no doubt that with the aid of an adequate mathematical calculus (which would have to be established on a realistic understanding of the respective properties of the fields of force coming into play) it will become possible to derive by calculation the speed of the establishment of light within physical space fr om the gravitational constant of the earth. 5 The grounds of Einstein's General Theory were dealt with in our earlier discussions."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":" 236 CHAPTER XVIII The Spectrum as a Sc ript of the Spirit The realization that Newton's explanation of the spectrum fails to meet the facts prompted Goethe to engage in all those studies which made him the founder of a modern optics based on intuitive participation in the phenomena. In spite of all that he achieved, however, he never reached a real solution of the riddle of the colour- phenomenon produced when light passes th rough a transparent body of prismatic shape. For his assumption of certain 'double images', which are supposed to appear as a result of the optical displacement of th e boundaries between the Light-filled and the Dark-filled parts of space a nd the mutual superposition of which he believed to be responsible for the appearan ce of the respective colours, does not solve the problem. 1 What hindered Goethe in this field was his limited insight into the nature of the two distinct kinds of forces which, as we have noted in the course of our own inquiries, correspond to his concepts of Licht and Finsternis. With the aid of this distinction - whic h we have indeed established through a consistent application of Goethe's method - we shall now be able to develop precisely that insight into the coming-into-being of the spectral colours which Goethe sought. 2 * Dynamically, the process of the formati on of the spectrum by light that passes through a prism divides into two clearly disti nguishable parts. The fi rst consists in the influence which the light undergoes inside the prism as a result of the latter's special shape, the other, in what happens outsi de the prism at the boundary between the Light-space - influenced by the shape of the prism - and the surrounding Dark-space. Accordingly, we shall study these tw o parts of the process separately. As an aid to distinguishing clearly one pr ocess from the other, we shall suppose the prism experiment to be so arranged that th e light area is larger than the width of the prism, which will then lie completely within it. We shall further suppose the dimensions of the whole to be such that th e part observable on the screen represents only a portion of the total li ght-realm situated between th e boundaries of the prism. The result is that the scre en depicts a light-phenomenon in which there is no trace of colour. For normal eyesight, the phenomenon on the screen differs in no way from what it would be if no prism interv ened in the path of the light. These two seemingly identical light-phenom ena reveal at once their inner dynamic difference if we narrow the field of light from either side by introducing into it an"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":" 237 object capable of casting sha dow. If there is no prism we see simply a black shadow move into the illumined area on the scree n, no matter from which side the narrowing comes. If, however, the light has come th rough a prism (arranged as described above) certain colours appear on the boundary betw een the regions of light and shadow, and these differ according to the side from which the darkening is effected. The same part of the light area may thus be made to displa y either the colours of the blue pole of the colour-scale, or those of the yellow pole. This shows that th e inner dynamic condition of the light-realm is altered in some way by being exposed to an optically resistant medium of prismatic shape. If we are to fi nd the cause and nature of this alteration we must revert to the prism itself, and inquire what effect it has on light in the part of space occupied by it. By proceeding in this way we follow Goethe's model: first, to keep the two border-phenomena separate, a nd, secondly, not to ascribe to the light itself what is in fact due to certain boundary conditions. In order to realize what happens to the light in passing through the prism, let us remember that it is a characteristic of an ordinary light-beam to direct itself through space in a straight line if not interfered with, and to illuminate equally any cross- section of the area it fills. Both these featur es are altered when the light is exposed to a transparent medium of prismatic shape - that is, to an optically resistant medium so shaped that the length of the light's passage through it changes from one side of the beam to the other, being least at the so-cal led refracting edge of the prism, greatest at the base opposite to that. The dimming e ffect of the medium, therefore, has a different magnitude at each point of th e width of the beam. Obviously, the ratio between levity and gravity inside such a lig ht-realm, instead of being constant, varies from one side to the other. The result is a transverse dynamic impulse which acts from that part of the light-realm where th e weakening influence of the prism is least towards the part where it is strongest (see long arrow in Plate C, Fig. i). 3 This impulse manifests in the deflection of the light from its original course. Apart from this, nothing is noticeable in the light itself when caught by an observation screen, the reason being that the transverse impulse now immanent in the light-realm has no effect on the reflecting surface. The situation changes when the light-realm is narrowed down from one side or the other - in other words, when an abrupt cha nge of the field-conditi ons, that is, a sudden leap from light to dark or from dark to li ght, is introduced within this realm. In this case, clearly, the effect of the transverse field-gradient on such a leap will be different, depending on the relation between the directions of the two (see small arrows in Fig. i). Our eyes witness to th is difference by seeing the colours of the blue pole of the colour-scale appear when the field-gradient is directed towards the leap (a), and the colours of the yellow pole when the gradient is directed away from it (b). For our further investigation it is very important to obser ve how the colours spread when they emerge at the edge of the sh adow-casting object thus introduced into the light-realm from the one side or the other. Figs, ii and iii on Plate C show, closely enough for our purpose, the position of the col our-bearing areas in ea ch case, with the dotted line indicating the direc tion which the light would ha ve at the place of origin"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":" 238 of the colours if there were no objec t interfering with its free expansion. 4 We observe a distinct difference in the widening out of the two colour-areas on both sides of the original direction of the light: in each case the angle which the boundary of the colour-area forms with this direction is sma ller on the side of the colours nearest the light-realm (blue and yellow re spectively) than on the opposite side (violet and red). Remembering what we have learnt about the dynamic charact eristics of the two colour-poles, we are now in a position to state the following. When a light-area subject to a lateral gradient is narrowed down, so that the gr adient is directed towards the narrowing object, colour s arise in which the interaction between the two polarically opposite forms of density is su ch that positive density makes for lightness, and negative density for darkness. Whereas, when the border is so situated that the gradient is directed away from it, the interaction is such that positive density makes for darkness, and negative density for lig htness. Further, the fact that on both occasions the darkness element in the colour -band increases in the outward direction tells us that in this direction there is on the blue-violet side a gradual decrease in positive, and increase in negative, density, while on the opposite side we find just the reverse. We note again that both processes occupy a considerable part of the space originally outside the boundaries of the light-area - that is, at the violet end the part towards which the light-beam is deflected, a nd at the red end the part from which it turns away. The visual ray, when penetrating active ly into the two colour-phenomena thus described, receives evidence of a dynamic happening which may be expressed as follows. Where the transverse impulse, which is due to the varying degree of TrAUbung in the light-realm, is directed to wards the latter's edge, the intermingling of the Dark- ingredient and the Light-ingred ient, contained in that r ealm, is such that Dark follows Light along its already exis ting gradient, thereby dimi nishing steadily. Hence our visual ray, meeting conditions quite simila r to those occurring when we look across the light-filled atmosphere into universal space, notifies us of the presence of the blue-violet colour-pole. If, on the other hand, th e edge is in the wake of the transverse impulse, then a kind of dynamic vacuum arises in that part of space from which the beam is deflected, with the effect that the Dark-ingredient, imprinted on the light within the prism, is drawn into this vacuum by following a kind of suctional influence. Consequently Dark and Light here come to oppose one another, and the former, on its way out of the light-area, gain s in relative strength. On this side our visual ray meets conditions resembling those which occur when we look across the darkening atmosphere into the sun. Accordingl y our optical experien ce tells us of the presence of the yellow-red colour-pole. From our description of the two kinds of dynamic co-ordination of positive and negative density at the two ends of the sp ectrum it follows that the spatial conditions prevailing at one end must be quite different from those at the other. To see this by way of actual perception is inde ed not difficult. In fact, if we believe that we see both"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":" 239 ends of the spectrum lying, as it were, fla tly on the surface of the observation screen, this is merely an illusion due to our superf icial way of using our eyes. If we gaze with our visual ray (activated in the manner previously described) into the two sides of the spectrum, while turning our eyes alternatel y in one or other direction, we soon notice that the colours of the yellow-red rise toward s the eye so as to give the impression of protruding almost corporeally from the surface of the screen. We feel: Density obtains here in a state of fi ery radiation. When turning to the other side we feel our visual ray, instead of being as before ca ught up in the colours, passing freely across the colours as if carried by them into the infinite. On the blue-violet side, space itself seems to fluoresce mysteriously 5 . Following Goethe's conception of the physical- moral effect of colours, we may describe the experience received thus from the two poles of the spectrum by saying that an 'o ther-worldly' character belongs to the colours of the blue-violet pole; an 'earthly' character to those of the yellow-red; while that of green, which appears when both side s are made to overlap, witnesses to its mediating nature between the two. * In our endeavour to view the fundamental experiment of Newtonian optics with the eyes of Goethe we have been led from the wide expanse of the earth's sunlit periphery into the confines of the darkened experime ntal chamber. With the aid of the results gained from studying the artificially produced spectrum phenomenon, we shall now return to our original fiel d of observation in order to study the same phenomenon in nature. There it meets us in the form of th e rainbow, which we shall now be able to read as a chapter in the great book of nature. From what we have learnt already we can say at once that the rainbow must represent some sort of border-phenomenon, thus poi nting to the existence of a boundary between two space-regions of differing illumi nation. Our question therefore must be: what is the light-image whose boundary co mes to coloured manifestation in the phenomenon of the rainbow? There can be no do ubt that the image is that of the sun- disk, shining in the sky. When we see a rai nbow, what we are really looking at is the edge of an image of the sun-disk, ca ught and reflected, owing to favourable conditions, in the atmosphere. (Observe in th is respect that the whole area inside the rainbow is always considerably brighter than the space outside.) Once we realize this to be the true nature of the rainbow, the p eculiar order of its colours begins to speak a significant language . The essential point to observe is that the blue-violet part of the spectrum lies on the inner side of the rainbow-arch - the side immediately adjoining the outer rim of the sun-image - while the yellow-red part lies on the outer side of the arch - the side turned away from the sun-image. What can we learn from this about the distribution of positive and negative density inside and outside the realm occupied by the sun-disk itself in the cosmos? We remember that along the gradient from blue to violet, negative density (Light) increases and positive density (Dark) decreases, while from yellow to red it is just the"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":" 240 reverse-positive density in creases and negative density decreases. The rainbow therefore indicates a steady increase of Da rk towards the outer rim, and of Light towards the inner. Evidently, what the optical image of the sun in the atmosphere thus reveals concerning the gradati on of the ratio between Light and Dark in the radial direction, is an attribute of the entire light-realm which stre tches from the sun to that image. And again, the attribut e of this realm is but an effect of the dynamic relation between the sun itself and the surrounding cosmic space. The rainbow thus becomes a script to us in which we read the rema rkable fact that the region occupied by the sun in th e cosmos is a region of nega tive density, in relation to which the region surrounding the sun is one of positive density. Far from being an accumulation of ponderable matter in a state of extremely high temperature, as science supposes, the sun represents the ve ry opposite of pondera bility. (It would be beyond the scope of this book to show how in th e light of this fact one learns to re- read the various solar phe nomena known to science.) Once we realize this, our judgment of all that our terrestrially devised optical instruments, such as the tele scope and spectroscope, tell us about the nature of the sun and its surroundings, will change accordi ngly. For it becomes clear that for the interpretation of solar phenomena shown by these instruments we cannot properly use concepts derived from observations within the earth's realm of positive density. To compare adequately solar and terrestrial phenomena, we must keep in mind that they are in every respect polar opposites. For instance, the fact that the spectroscope reveals phenomena in the sun's light which ar e strikingly similar to others occurring when earthly matter is firs t caused to emit light - that is, brought near the upper border of its ponderable existe nce - and then studied sp ectroscopically, should not impose on us the illusion that the sun consis ts of matter in this same condition. On the contrary, the similarity shoul d tell us that imponderable substance, while on its way between sun and earth to ponderable existen ce, assumes, at the point of transition, aspects exactly like those revealed by ponderable substance at the corresponding point in its upward transformation. What we observe, when we study the sun thr ough a spectroscope, is not the sun itself, but the conditions obtaining in this border-region, wh ere imponderable substance enters the earth-realm. The rainbow, directly we learn to see it as the border-phenomenon that it is, tells us something of itself which revives in mode rn form a conception held generally in former ages, when it was seen as a mediator between the cosmic-divine and the earthly-human worlds. Thus the Bible speaks of it as a symbol of God's reconciliation with the human race after the great Flood. Thus the Greeks beheld it when they saw it as the bridge of Iris, messenger of the Gods; and similarly the Germanic mythology speaks of it as the pathway along which the s ouls of the fallen warriors draw near to Valhalla. By recovering this old conception in a new and scientifically grounded form we are enabled also to rectify the misunde rstanding from which the ancient bridge-"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":" 241 conception of the rainbow has suffered in later days, when tradition had begun to replace direct insight into the truth. When with the rise of man's onlooker-relation to the world of the senses, the rainbow could appear to him only as a form flatte ned against the sky, people began to think that the ancient picture of it as a bridge had been derived from its likeness to the latter's arched form. Representations of the rainbow from these times indeed show supersensible beings, such as the souls of the dead, moving upwards and downwards along the two halves of the arch. It is not in this abstract way that ancient man formed his cosmic imagery. What was seen going on between the upper and nether worlds when a rainbow appeared in the heights of the atmosphere was no traffic over the arch, but an interplay across the rainbow between the realm of levity, glimmering down in the rainbow's violet border, and the realm of gravity glowing up from the red. And this is how we have now learnt to see it again. * At one point in our optical st udies (page 259) we referred to some words of Ruskin in which he deplored the influence exerted on the soul-life of mode rn man by the world- conception of science. He illustrated this by showing how much less inspiration a man trained in the science of optics receive s from the sight of a rainbow than does a 'simple peasant'. One lesson of our studies is that training in optics, if it proceeds on Goethean lines, has no such detrimental eff ect. There is, however, a further problem, outside Ruskin's scope, which we are now ab le to approach in the same healthy way. Ruskin distinguishes between three possible stages in man's relation to the world of the senses. The first stage he calls that of 'inactive reverie'; the second - in a certain respect more advanced - that of 'useful t hought', the stage of scientifically awakened man to whom all things disintegrate into countable and nothing but countable parts. Beyond this, Ruskin conceives of a third, still higher stage, in which man becomes capable of raising himself through 'higher co ntemplation' into an artistic-ethical relation to the content of the sense-world. Now, in the way Ruskin represents the second and third stages they seem to be excl usive of one another. That was as far as he could go, in his own day. Natural observa tion along Goethean lines leads to a form of higher contemplation which unites the second and third stages by nourishing man's ethical being and at the sa me time furnishing him with useful knowledge-knowledge, that is, which enables him to improve the conditions of the human race on the earth. The following is an example of the practical possibilities that ope n up in the field we are discussing if we apply the knowledge gained through our new approach to the forces working in nature. We shall speak here of a task of expe rimental research which was mentioned by Rudolf Steiner in connexion with the renewal of na tural science. Rudolf Steiner felt the need for pioneer s who, by advancing along the paths opened up by Goethe, would press forward into th e realm of undiscovered phenomena on the"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":" 242 upper border of nature, and this prompted hi m to give to those who were ready to listen various pointers towards new ways of experimental research. In so far as practical results have already been reached along these lines, they lie in the fields of biology and physiology (and of chemistry, in a cer tain respect) rather than in that of physics. Now, among the indications given in th is latter field, and not yet worked out, there is one which deals with a way, unknow n to-day, of influencing the spectrum by the magnet. The possibility of a magnetic influence on the spectrum is, in itself, not unknown to modern physics. It was the Dutchman, Zeeman, who first observed a change in the appearance of certain spectra l lines as a result of light passing through a magnetic field. This discovery, however, is in two respects typical of modern science. The Zeeman effect consists in the splitting up of certain spectral lines into other lines - hence, of a breaking up of a whole into pa rts. And by seemingly providing a decisive confirmation of contemporary views concerni ng the electromagnetic nature of light, Zeeman's discovery has formed one of th e milestones in the progress of modern physical thought - with the usual result that an enlargement of man's knowledge of the behaviour of natural forces has served to entangle his concep tion of nature still more deeply in illusion. Apart from the fact that our own way of combining observation and thought guards us against drawing theoretical conclusions fr om Zeeman's discovery, Rudolf Steiner's indication opens up the prospect of achie ving quite practical results, opposite in character to those of the Z eeman effect. For in contradistinction to the use of a magnetic field for splitting the spectrum, Rudolf Steiner has made us aware of the possibility of uniting into a higher synthe sis parts of the spectrum which normally appear in separated form. His indication po ints to nothing less than a leading over of the optically produced spectru m from its usual linear form, with two boundaries on either side, into a closed circular form, and of doing this by an adequate application - as yet undiscovered - of magnetic force. Furt her, according to his statement, the point where the two ends of the spectrum meet w ill prove to be a fountain-head of certain higher natural forces which otherw ise are not directly accessible. In order to understand how this is possible, we must remember that in two respects the spectrum is not a complete phenomenon. Th ere is, to begin wit h, the fact that the colour-band visible on the obs ervation screen is only a pparently confined to the surface of the screen. For, as we have see n, because of the differing co-ordination of levity and gravity at the two ends of th e spectrum, the conditions of space prevailing at each are polarically opposite. Negative space opens up spherically behind the blue- violet colours on one side, while positive space, filled by the radially shining yellow- red colours, arises on the other. So we see that what we found earlier for the two poles of magnetism and electricity holds good also for the spectrum. That is, the two processes bringing about the relevant phenomen a are not confined to the part of space which these phenomena seem to occupy; for the whole positive and negative realms of the universe share in them. Hence the spectrum, though apparently bounded at its two ends, proves by its very nature to be part of a greater whole."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":" 243 Once before we were led to recognize - though from a different aspect - that the spectrum is a phenomenon which, when rightly viewed, calls for a certain completion. In following Goethe's initial observations we realized that the known spectrum, extending from red via green to violet, has a counterpart extending from violet via peach-blossom to red. The r eader may have wondered why we never returned to this other spectrum, in spite of the role it played in making Goethe aware of Newton's error. The reason was that in order to gain the understanding we needed of the spectrum, we had to observe the tw o border-phenomena independently - that is, without regard to their relati ve positions. Moreover, with ordinary optical means it is possible to produce only one type of spectrum at a time, so that each is left in need of being complemented by the other. In order to have both together in finite space, as part of one and the same phenomenon, space itself must be dynamically transformed in such a way that the con tinuation of the finite spectra l band running through infinity enters into the finite as well. Our understanding of magnetism as a specific representation of the polarity of the second order enables us to comprehend, at least in principle, how magnetism might influence - not light itself, as present- day physics erroneously believes - but the secondary polarity of the sp ectral colours formed out of the primary polarity Light and Dark. To see this in all necessary detail is a task of the future, beyond the scope of this book. We have here to continue our account of Rudolf Steiner's statement by communicating what he indicate d concerning the particular nature of the new source of force which would appear in the normally in finite part of the spectrum, if this were brought into the region of the finite. In order to understand the signi ficance of this indication we must turn our attention to parts of the ordinary spectrum, well known in themselves, which we have purposely left out of our study so far. These are the re gions of the ultra-viol et and the infra-red, invisible in themselves, but forming part of the spectrum as a whole. The ultraviolet manifests through chemical effects, the in fra-red through thermal effects. We have left them out of our considerations because these regions of the spectrum differ from the visible part not only quantitatively, as present-day science believes, but qualitatively also, and in a fundamental way. We must regard them as dynamic realms of particularly extreme spherical and radial activities. As such they represent metamorphoses, in the Goethean sense, of the levity-gravity interaction represented by the optically visible part of the spectru m. In this way the spectrum discloses a threefold differentiation of that region of force, which up to now we have called simply levity, into activities producing chemical, optical and thermal effects. So far physical investigation is able to l ead us, but no further. If, however, we let nature herself speak to us, while holding this differentiated concept of levity in mind, she tells us that beyond the three metamorphos es envisaged so far, there must be a fourth. Let us remember that it was certain phenomen a of life which first made us aware of the existence of a realm of forces with th e attributes of anti-gravity, and that these"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" 244 forces revealed themselves first as creat ors of form. Now it is obvious that warmth, light and chemical energy, though they all play an essential part in living organisms, could never by themselves bring about that 'catching from chaos, carbon, water, lime and what not and fastening them into a gi ven form' which Ruskin describes as the activity of the spirit in the plant. In order to be in this sense an instrument of the spirit active in nature, levity must be capable of yet another me tamorphosis into an activity which controls the other three, so that th rough their action, definitely shaped organic structures may come into being. The reason why this fourth and highest meta morphosis of Light does not appear in the ordinary spectrum is because it is of too sp iritual a quality to be caught by the optical apparatus. In nature herself a creative lif e-process requires always the presence of a germ already imbued with life. And so, in or der to call this fourth metamorphosis of Light into the spectrum, stronger means are needed than the mere optical transformation of light-filled spaces. This stronger agent, according to Rudolf Steiner, is magnetism. With the aid of this it w ill be possible to organize together round a common spatial centre that part of the activ ity of levity which escapes the optical instrument and thus remains cosmic, and that part which appears by itself in terrestrial space. Once this is practically carried out, we may expect a complete colour-circle to appear as already divined by Goethe. The full circle consists of twelve discernible colours, with the Goethean peach-blossom diametrically opposite the gree n. It is in this region of the peach-blossom that - again according to Rudolf Steiner - we shall find a source of actively working life-forces, springing fr om the fourth metamorphosis of levity. Such is the prospect for resear ch work guided on the new lines. POSTSCRIPT The fact of our having disclosed here one of Rudolf Steiner's i ndications concerning as yet undetected possibilities of scientific research, make s it necessary to deal with an objection which may be raised, particul arly by some readers who already know this indication through their own relation to Rudolf Steiner's work. They may object to a discussion of the subject in a publica tion such as this, feeling it dangerous to hand over to the world information which in the economic battles of to-day might be used in a sense contrary to the social-moral aims to which the work of Rudolf Steiner was dedicated. In reply it may be said that all we have gone through in this book has shown that concrete knowledge of the world cannot be ga ined without a certain ethical effort by the seeker. Therefore, anyone who receives su ch knowledge with a passive attitude of soul will find it meaningless, and will be qui te unable to turn it to practical account. We may therefore rest assured that the solu tion of the problem related here, as of any other experimental task set by Rudolf Steiner, will contain in itself a guarantee that no use will be made of it detrimental to the true progress of mankind."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":" 245 On the other hand, the present world-s ituation, which to so high a degree is determined by the vast liberation of the s ub-physical forces of the earth, makes one feel it is essential not to cl ose the considerations of the fields of knowledge dealt with in these chapters, without a hint at the practical possibilities which arise from a continuation of Goethe's strivings in this field. 1 See, in Rudolf Steiner's edition of Goethe's scien tific writings, his footnote to Goethe's criticism of Nuguet's theory of the spectrum in the historical part of the Farbenlehre (Vol. IV, p. 248, in KAUrschner's edition). 2 It is obvious that the reader who wishes to ap preciate fully the signific ance of the observations described in the following paragraphs, must, as in previous cases, carry out these observations himself. 3 In this and the two following diagrams the light-r ealm has been represented as being less wide than the space obtained by the prism. To avoid unnecessary complexity the colours wh ich, in such a case, actually appear at the border of the light-realm wh ere it emerges from the pr ism are not shown in any of the diagrams. 4 This direction can be established with sufficient exactitude by holding a very thin object right in front of the prism and marking with a stretched thre ad the direction which leads from the object to its shadow on the screen. The colour-producing edge must then be introduced from either side so that it just touches the thread. 5 The difference in character of the various parts of the spectrum, as described above, comes out particularly impressively if for capturing the colour-phenomenon one uses instead of a flat white surface, a clear crystal of not too small size, or else a cluster of crystals - moving it slowly along the coloured band from one end to the other.

(a) INTRODUCTORY NOTE A fundamental achievement along our path of study was the recognition that a force of levity exists, polar to that of gravit y, and that these two together represent a primary polarity in nature which in turn is the source of nature's manifold secondary polarities. In the last part of these st udies a vista opened up of an i nner differentiation of levity itself into warmth, light, chemical action a nd the formative activit y of life. Our next task will be to develop a cl earer conception of these four modes of action of levity. In undertaking this task, however, we shall have to extend our observations of nature beyond the frontier that can be reached by us ing only what we can learn from Goethe. It is here that Rudolf Steiner comes to our aid by what he was able to impart through his researches in the realm of the supersensible itself. This turning to information given by a nother mind, whose sources of knowledge are beyond our own immediate reach, seems at firs t sight to be incompatible with the principles guiding all our studies hitherto ; for in gaining insight into the How and Whence of a phenomenon of the sense-world we have up to now admitted only what is yielded by an observation of the phenomenon per se (though with the aid of the 'eye of the spirit') and of other phenomena re lated to it. This is what we have called 'reading in the book of nature', and we have found it to be the method on which a science aspiring to overcome the onlooker-pic ture of the universe must be based. So we must first make sure that the step we now propose to take does not violate this principle. * The assurance we want will be found in two characteristics of the communications made by Rudolf Steiner from his researches. The content of these communications was acquired by way of a 'reading' which is nothing but a higher metamorphosis of the reading first employed by Goethe; and th e acceptance of this content by another mind is itself nothing but another act of readi ng, save that the direction of the reading gaze differs from the usual one."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" 248 In order to understand this we must go back to what we learnt in the course of our optical studies as to the two forms of vision arising from the activity of the eye's inner light - the dream-vision and the seeing of af ter-images. Of these two, seeing in dream is in a certain sense the purer form of inne r seeing in that it ar ises without any outer stimulus exercised upon the physical organ of sight. On the other hand, it lacks that objective conformity to law characteristic of the after-images which mirror the order of the external world. There is an arbitrar y, enigmatic element in dream-pictures, and their logic often seems to run counter to that of waking consciousness. A further characteristic of dream-perception is that we are tied to the level of consciousness prevailing in the dream. While we are dream ing we cannot awaken to the extent of being able to make the pictures the object of conscious observation. With the after-images it is different. Although to begin with they are present in our consciousness with a clarity no greater than that of the dream-pic tures, nevertheless we are able so to enhance our consciousness of them as to bring them under observation like any external phenomenon. As previously shown, it is possible, even while the eye is riveted on an impression from outside, to develop such awareness in the activity of the inner light called forth by this impressi on, that together with the results of the deeds and sufferings of the light we can perceive something of these deeds and sufferings themselves. Perception of the after-images thus turns into what we may call perception of simultaneous imag es. (This activity of the eye corresponds with what Goethe, in a different connexi on, called an 'alliance of the eyes of spirit with the eyes of the body'.) These two forms of visual perception - wh ich we may briefly call: (1) perception of post -images, and (2) perception of co-ima ges - represent successive rungs on a 'spiritual ladder' pointing beyond themselves to a further rung. By the logic of succession this may be expected to c onsist in some sort of seeing of pre -images, with the characteristic of being a still less physical mode of seeing than the two others. This seeing must be based on an activity of the inner light which will be similar to that in dream by its arising without any stimulus from ex ternal light-impressions, yet at the same time there must be no arbitrar iness in the contents of this perception. Further, our consciousness in th is perceptive activity must be such as to allow us to be in full control of it, as we ar e of ordinary day-waking seeing. This kind of pure sense-free perception does indeed exist, and it can be aroused by means of a well-ordered training from the dorma nt state in which it is present in every human being. Anyone who learns to see in th is way gains percepti on of the activity of cosmic light, contacting it direc tly with his own inner light - that is to say, without mediation of his corporeal eye which is subj ect to gravity. So th is eye-of-the-spirit becomes capable of perceiving the lev ity-woven archetypes (ur-images), which underlie all that the physical eye discer ns in the world of ordinary space. In respect of the intrinsic character of the world-content t hus perceived, Rudolf Steiner called this mode of perceptio n, Imaginative perception, or, simply, Imagination. By so doing he invested this word with its due and rightful meaning."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":" 249 From what we found in our optical studies concerning the nature of after-images (Chapter XV), it is clear that the acquisi tion of Imaginative perception rests on a re- awakening in the eye (and thus in the total organism behind th e eye) of certain 'infant' forces which have grown dormant in the course of the growing up of the human being. It thus represents a fulfilment of Thomas Reid's philosophic demand. Consequently we find among the descriptions which Traherne gives of the mode of perception peculiar to man when the inner light, brought into this world at birth, is not yet absorbed by the physical eye, many helpful characterizations of the nature of Imaginative perception, some of which may be quoted here. Consider, in this respect, the following passage from Traherne's poem The Praeparative, quoted earlier. In describing the st ate of soul at a time when the physical senses are not yet in operation, Traherne says: 'Then was my Soul my only All to me, A living, endless Ey, Whose Power, and Act, and Essence was to see: I was an inward Sphere of Light Or an interminable Orb of Sight, Exceeding that which makes the Days, A vital sun that shed abroad its Rays: All Life, all Sense, A naked, simple, pure Intelligence.'' This is the condition of soul of which Trah erne says in the same poem that through it a man is still a recipient of the 'true Ideas of all things'. In this condition the object of sight is not the corporeal world which reflect s the light, but light its elf, engaged in the weaving of the archetypal images. In a later passage of the same poem Traherne expresses this by saying: ' Tis not the Object, but the Light That maketh Hev'n . ...' And more clearly still in th e following part of his poem An Infant Eye : ' A simple Light from all Contagion free, A Beam that's purely Spiritual, an Ey That's altogether Virgin, Things doth see Ev'n like unto the Deity; That is, it shineth in an hevenly Sense, And round about (Unmov'd) its Light dispense. 'The visiv Rays are Beams of Light indeed, Refined, subtil, piercing, quick and pure; And as they do the sprightly winds exceed, Are worthy longer to endure; They far out-shoot the Reach of Grosser Air,"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" 250 With which such Excellence may not compare. But being once debas'd, they soon becom Less activ than they were before.' How at this stage the soul experiences the act of perception in itself is shown in the following passage from the poem Wonder: 'A Nativ Health and Innocence Within my Bones did grow And while my God did all his Glories show I felt a vigour in my Sense That was all SPIRIT: I within did flow With seas of Life like Wine.' Utterances of this kind illustrate the fact th at perception of the ur-images of the world consists in a reading with the eye-of-the-spi rit, which has been rendered so strong that for its action no support from the physical ey e is any longer required. This faculty of spiritual Imagination (which Rudolf Steiner wa s able to exercise in advance of other human beings) is acquired on a path of traini ng which is the direct continuation of the Goethean path. 1 It remains to show that acceptance of information obtained through spiritual Imagination, without ourselves being as yet in actual command of it, is not in contradiction with the principles of 'reading' . Let us, to this end, think of reading in the ordinary sense of this word, calling to mind that for the acquisition of this faculty we depend on someone who can teach it because he already has it. Exactly the same holds good for the reading with which we ar e here concerned. Here, too, a teacher already possessing this faculty is required. Thus Goethe became for us a teacher of reading, and it would be a mistake to imagine that he, for his part, needed no teacher. In his case this function was fulfilled partly by what he learned through his studies of the earlier fruits of man's spiritual activity, that is, from an epoch when vestiges at least of the original, instinctive faculty of spiritual Imagination were still extant. A similar function on our own path of study was performed by our occupation with the old doctrine of the four elements and the basic concepts of alchemy. Indispensable as is such a training in read ing by turning to past conceptions of man, it does not suffice to meet the present-day de mands of a scientific understanding of the universe. For this, we need a 'technique' of reading that cannot be attained along these lines alone. Awareness of this fact led Rudol f Steiner to pursue hi s spiritual-scientific investigations and to communicat e the results in such a way that they can be a 'school of reading' for those who study them. 2 In point of fact we ha ve already made use in this sense of one of the results of Rudolf Steiner's researches, for at the very beginning of this book his picture of the th reefold psycho-physical organism of man was taken as the basis of our own investig ations. The reason why the present remarks were not then included is that the relevant results of higher research were in that case of such a nature that, once known, they coul d be confirmed by the simplest kind of"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":" 251 self-observation. The fact, however, remains that from the very beginning we have called upon one fully trained in reading, to help in deciphering certain facts of nature - in this case of human nature. A similar need, though now in an amplified fo rm, arises at the present stage of our studies. And here, out of the wealth of knowledge conveyed by Rudolf Steiner from the realm of supersensible Imagination, it is his characterization of the four modifications of levity which will now give the guidance necessary for our own observation. Adopting the terminology chos en by him for the description of this sphere, we shall in future speak of it as of the 'Ether' pervading the universe (thus using this word also in its true and origin al meaning). Accordingly, we shall refer to its fourfold differentiation as to the four kinds of ethe r: Warmth-Ether, Light-Ether, Chemical Ether and Life-Ether. (b) WARMTH We begin with the warmth-ether as the only modification of ether which combines certain etheric with certain physical pr operties. Constituting as it does a border- condition between the two worlds, the wa rmth-ether has, on the one hand, the function of receiving the picture-weaving transmitted to it by the higher ethers, and, on the other, of bringing physical matter in to the state where it becomes receptive to the working of the etheric forces. The wa rmth-ether achieves this by freeing matter from being controlled one-sidedly by the cen tre-bound forces of the earth. It thus calls forth, when acting physically, th e processes of melting of so lids and of evaporation of liquids: phenomena which yielded the initial observations for our introduction of the concept of levity. In processes of th is kind we now recognize the physical manifestation of a universal function of the warmth-ether, namely, to divest matter of all form and to lead it over from the real m dominated by gravity in to that of levity. Provided we attach the right meaning to the word, we may say that the function of the warmth-ether is to bring about chaos at the upper border of phys ical nature. It is thus that we have already found it working in the plant, when through the union of the pollen with the seed a state of chaos is produced within the seed, which enables the type to impress anew its fo rm-principle into it. Another instance of the warmth-ether's anti-gr avitational effect, also discussed earlier, is the earth's seismic activity. True, it appear s at first sight as if little were gained by speaking of warmth-ether, instead, as we did previously, of levity in general. But it must not be forgotten that in the ether-r ealm as a whole, warmth - that is, the overcoming of earthly gravity - is only one of the four modes of etheric action, albeit the one which enables the other three to wo rk into the physical world. We shall see, later on, that only by taking into account the action of the higher modifications of the ether is it possible to gain in sight into the true causes of the apparently so arbitrary occurrences of volcanic and kindred phenomen a. Here, too, it is the function of the warmth-ether to produce in the physical sphe re the chaos which is necessary to make the physical sphere receptive to the ac tivities going on in higher spheres."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":" 252 In view of this universal function of the warmth-ether, which distinguishes it from the other modifications of ether, we may give it as a second name that of 'chaoticizing ether'. * * * (c) LIGHT The function of the light-ether , the second of the four mode s of ether, can best be envisaged by thinking of the difference betw een a plant growing in darkness (perhaps a potato sprouting in a cella r) and another of the same species exposed to the influence of the light. On Plates VII and VIII two kinds of unicellular organisms are shown, of one which - the green algae - is accustomed to live in light, the other - the bacilli - in darkness. These things are, of course, well-known facts. Our purpose here, however, is not merely to record them as 'fact', but, by re-creating them within ourselves, to use them to gain an experi ence of the function of the light-ether. The following passages from Goethe's Metamorphosis of Plants are a classical example of observation of the activity of the light-ether in the plant. They are taken from the second part of the essay, where Goethe is describing leaf-development: 'While the leaves owe their first nourishment principally to the more or less modified watery parts, which they draw from the st em, they are indebted for their increased perfection and refinement to the light a nd air. The cotyledons which are formed beneath the closed seed-sheath are charged, so to speak, with only a crude sap; they are scarcely and but rudely organized and quite undeveloped. In the same way the leaves are more rudely orga nized in plants which grow under water than in others which are exposed to the open air. Indeed, even the same species of plant develops smoother and less intricately formed leav es when growing in low damp places, whereas, if transplanted to a higher regi on, it will produce leaves which are rough, hairy and more delicately finished.' 'So it is also with the anastomosis of the vessels which spring forth from the larger veins, seeking each other with their e nds and coalescing, and thus providing the necessary basis for the leaf-skin or cuticle. All this, if not entirely caused by subtle forms of air, is at least very much furt hered by them. If the leaves of many water- plants are thread-like or assu me the form of antlers, we ar e inclined to attribute it to lack of complete anastomosis. Th e growth of the water buttercup, Ranunculus aquatilis, shows this quite obviously, with its aquatic leaves consisting of mere thread-like veins, while in the leaves developed above water the anastomosis is complete and a connected plane is formed. Occasionally, indeed, in this plant, the transition may be still more definitely observed, in leaves which are half anastomosed and half thread-like.' The second of these paragraphs describe s the phenomenon of vascular anastomosis which, having already been more than once an object of our study, here reveals a new"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":" 253 meaning. If, following Goethe's method, we re-create in our mind the repeated separations and reunions of th e sap-vessels, while keeping in view the fact that the leaf's outer form is the result of a purposiv e, many times repeated anastomosis, then the picture of the activity of weaving arises before our mind's eye. (Hence the word 'tissue' for the flesh of a living being.) In truth all nature's forms are woven of light, including the crystals. 3 How clear a picture Goethe had of the conf ormity of man's act of thinking with nature's way of producing her forms - both be ing an act of supersensible weaving - is shown by the following two verses. That on the left is a passage from Faust, from the scene in which Mephisto (disguised as Faus t) instructs the young Scholar. The other is an altered version of it , written by Goethe at a late r time to conclude an essay (Bedenken und Ergebung) in which he deals with the problem of the relation between Experience and Idea: Truly, when men their thoughts conceive 'Tis as if some masterpiece they weave. One thread, and a thousand strands take flight, Swift to and fro the shuttles going, All unseen the threads a-flowing, One stroke, and a thousand close unite. 1 So with a modest eye perceive Her masterpiece Dame Nature weave. One thread, and a thousand strands take flight, Swift to and fro the shuttles going, Each to the other the threads a-flowing, One stroke, and a thousand close unite . 4 - What Goethe wants to show here by applying to the activity of nature the same image which he used originally to depict the act of thinki ng, we can express to-day by saying that it is the identity of the activity of the light-ether in human thinking and in external nature which is res ponsible for the fact that the objective ideas operating in nature can become the content of man' s consciousness in the form of thoughts. 5 Following our previous procedure when we gave the warmth-ether a second name by calling it chaoticizing ether, we can denote the light-ether also as 'weaving ether'. * If at this point in our discussion we re vert once more to th e realm of physical manifestations of light, dealt with in the preceding chapters, we do so because by studying them in the present context we shall ga in further insight into the fact that one plane of nature provides illustrations of processes which on another plane remain more or less veiled. At the same time this will help us to learn more about the properties of levity-space. The optical phe nomenon which we shall discuss in this"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":" 254 sense is that of the so-called pin-hole camera. (The pin-hole camera effect is easily produced by a keyhole in a closed door wh ich on one side faces a window and on the other leads to a comparatively dark room.) The usual explanation of the appearance of the optical imag e on the back inside wall of such a camera is that light-rays, eman ating from every point outside, cross each other in the aperture of the camera and so - again point by point - create the inverted image. No such explanation, clearly, is open to us. For the world of external objects is a whole, and so is its image appearing in the camera. Equally, the light entering the camera is not a sum of single rays. Pure obs ervation leads to the following description of the optical process. By surveying the path which the light takes from the illuminated surface of the outer objects via the pin-hole to th e optical image inside the camera, we realize that the light-realm engaged in this pr ocess has the shape of a doubl e cone, with its apex in the opening of the camera. Within this c one the light carries the image across the space stretching in front of th e light-reflecting objects up to the point where the image becomes visible by being caught on the back wall of the camera. Thus in every section of the c one the image is present in its totality - even in the very apex of the cone. There, too, the image in all its details is present as a whole, though without (ideally) any sp atial extension. Seen thus, on this level of its action the light- ether reveals as one of its characteristics the faculty of making present in a spaceless point an image originally expanded in space, and of letting it emerge from this point in spatial expansion. Further, there is the fact that, wherever we set up a pin-hole camera, the aperture in its front will cause the formation of an optical image inside it. This shows that each point in space filled with light is the bearer of an optical image, contracted to a point, of the entire world of light-reflecti ng objects surrounding it. All we do with such a camera is to select a particular image and bring it to separate visibility. Through these observations we grow awar e of light's faculty of communicating simultaneously to space as a whole, and to each point in it, a pot ential image of the light-reflecting object. What we observe here in the sphere of physi cal light-activity is ex actly what the light- ether performs on a higher level of nature wh en with its help the spiritual archetype of a plant takes on spatial appearance. For to th is end the archetype, itself without spatial limitations, imprints its image into the tiny seed, whence the growing plant organism carries it again into space. And there is in principle no limitation to the number of such seeds, each of which will bear the complete image of the archetype. * * * (d) SOUND"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":" 255 The characteristics of the third modificati on of ether are such that they prompted Rudolf Steiner to give it as a second name, besides chemical ether, that of sound- ether. In view of the fact, stressed at the begi nning of this chapter, that perception of the ether is achieved by a heightening of the power of the spirit-eye, it must cause surprise to learn that a cert ain mode of activity of the ether has a quality which makes appeal to aural experiences. The full answer to this riddle must await the discussion that follows this chapter. Two points, however, may be brought forward at once. Firstly, where gravity, with its tendency to individualize, is absent, no such sharp distinctions exist between one form of perception and another as are found in the sphere of the physical senses. 6 Secondly, even in ordinary sense-perception a certain overlapping of visual and aural experiences is known to us. We need only think how common it is to give musical attributes, such as 'consonant' and 'dissonant' to colours, and to describe tones as 'light' and 'dar k'. The reason is that subconsciously we accompany visual experiences with tone-sen sations, and vice versa. Cases are even known of human beings in whom the secondary sensation occurs with such intensity as to equal the primary one. Such people say that they 'see' sounds and 'hear' colours. * Everything that is true of the supersensi ble sphere we may expect to come to expression in some form in the world of se nse-perception. The sphere of the ether is the sphere of the creative archetypes of the world, and when we learn that to one part of this world the character of sound is at tributed, we must search for a phenomenon, perceptible to our senses, which reveals to us the secret of the sound's form-creating power. This we have in the so-calle d sound-figures, discovered by the German physicist Chladni (1756-1827) a nd called after him 'Chladni 's sound-figures'. A short description of how they are produced will not be out of place. A round or square plate of glass or brass, fixed at its centre so that it can vibrate freely at its edges, is require d. It is evenly and not too thickly covered with fine sand or lycopodium powder and then caused to vibrate acoustically by the repeated drawing of a violin-bow with some pressure across the edge of the plate until a steady note becomes audible. Through the vibrati ons thus caused within the plate, the particles of sand or powder are set in movement and cau sed to collect in certain stationary parts of the plate, thereby creating"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" 256 figures of very regular and often surprisi ng form. By stroking th e plate at different points on the edge, and at the same time da mping the vibrations by touching the edge at other points with the finger, notes of different pitch can be produced, and for each of these notes a characteristic figure will appear (Fig. 14). 7 The significance for us of Chladni's experime nt will emerge still more clearly if we modify it in the following way. Instead of directly setting the plate with the powder into vibration by stroking it with the bow, we produce a corresponding movement on a second plate and let it be transmitted to the other by resonance. For this purpose the two plates must be acoustically tuned to each other and placed not too far apart. Let us imagine, further, that the whole experime nt was arranged - as it well might be - in such a way that the second plate was hidden from a spectator, who also lacked the faculty of hearing. This gives us a picture of the situation in which we find ourselves whenever the higher kinds of ether by way of a tone-activity inaudible to our physical ear, cause shapeless matter to assume regularly ordered form. * This comparison of the activity of the sound- ether, as the form-creating element in nature, with Chladni's phenomenon is drawn co rrectly only if we recognize that the conception of form, as an expression of that which is called forth through the etheric forces in nature, comprises more than the external spatially bounded shape of an"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":" 257 organic or inorganic entit y. Apart from the fact alr eady indicated, that for the formation of such entities the co-operati on also of life-ether is necessary, we can judge the activity of sound-et her correctly only if we c onceive it as a much more inward activity, compared with the formati on in external space of Chladni's figures. In the latter case, the reason why the influence of sound causes nothing beyond the ordering of form in outer space is because on this plane of nature the only changes that can occur are changes in the positions of separate physical bodies. Where the forces of sound in ether-form are able to take hold of matter fr om within, they can produce changes of form of a quite different kind. This effect of the activity of sound- ether has given it its other name: chemical ether. We have mentioned once before that our c onception of 'form' in organically active nature must not be limited merely to that of a body's spatial outline. This was in connexion with Ruskin's definition of the sp iritual principle activ e in plant-formation as 'the power that catches out of chaos char coal, water, lime and what not, and fastens them down into a given form'. Besides the ex ternal order of matte r revealed in space- form, there exists also an inner qualita tive order expressed in a body's chemical composition. Upon this inner chemical order is based all that we encounter as colour, smell, taste, etc., of a substance, as well as its nourishing, healing or harmful properties. Accordingly, all these parts of an organism, both in the plant-kingdom and within the higher organisms, have a certain inner material order, apart from their characteristic space-structure. The one is ne ver present without the other, and in some way they are causally connected. In this inner order of substance we must s ee in the very first place the work of the sound or chemical ether. And we should be aw are that by the word 'chemistry' in this connexion we mean something much more fa r-reaching than those chemical reactions which we can bring about by the reciprocal affinity of physical substances, however complicated these reactions may be. A few examples will illustrate the difference between chemical processes caused by direct influence of the chemical ether, and others in which only the physical conse quences of the ether are effective. In his book, Man the Unknown, Professor Carrel shows very impressively, by an example from the human organism, the diffe rence of quantitative ratio in externally similar processes, one of which occurs within the domain of life, the other, outside it. He compares the quantity of liquid necessa ry to keep artificia lly alive a piece of living tissue which has been reduced to pulp, with th e quantity of blood doing the same within the living organism. If all th e tissues of a human body were treated in this way, it would take 45,000 gallons of circ ulating fluid to keep them from being poisoned in a few days by their own waste products. Within the living organism the blood achieves the same task with 1J gallons. Very many chemical changes within living organisms are effected by the two polar processes of oxidation and reduction. We have discussed them repeatedly as hieroglyphs of much that occurs in nature by way of polarity. In accordance with the principle ruling the physical plane of natu re, that differences of level tend to"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" 258 disappear, oxidation can occur by itself, whereas reduction requi res the expenditure of energy. Let us from this point of view compare the transformation of oxidized into reduced iron, as it takes place inside and outside the realm of life. An example of this process in its purely phys ical form is the reduction of iron-ore to metallic iron in blast-furnaces, where, w ith the help of high temperature and high pressure, carbon is made to combine with the oxygen ingredient of the ore and to impart to it its own imponderable energy. Precisely the same process is going on continuously and unobtrusively within the human body under normal bodily conditions of temperature and pressure, wh en the oxy-haemoglobin of the arterial blood changes over into the haemoglobin of the venous blood. A macrotelluric counterpart of this is the transformation of the red river-mud into the blue-black continental mud at the bottom of the sea, around the continental shores. Here, again, reduction takes place without those preliminaries that are necessary for carrying through the process by technical means. Through examples of this kind we gain insight into the nature of the chemical ether as a 'magic' force (in the sense in which we ha ve introduced this term at the beginning of the book). What the chemical ether is capable of effecting in a gentle manner, so to speak, in cooperation with th e inertness-overcom ing power of the warmth-ether, can be imitated physically only by an extraordinary concentrat ion of external energy and the use of masses of material substance. At the same time the imitation is never complete. For to all that happens through the action of the chemical ether there belongs the quality of cosmic youth, wh ile everything brought about in a purely physical manner is of necessity cosmically old. 8 Of all the provinces of natu re towards which man's explor ing eye has turned since the dawn of the onlooker-consciousness, none has furthered his purely quantitative thinking more than chemistry, ever since the discovery that the chemical reactions of the various substances are conditioned by a quite definite and constant numerical relationship. It was these relationships which impelled the rise of the atomic conception of matter and all its consequences. For sin ce the onlooker-consciousness is quite unable to conceive the existence of numerical relationships in the physical world except as sums of computable units in space, it was natural for this type of consciousness to reduce all empirically es tablished numerical relationships to correspending relationships am ong quantities of the smallest possible material or matter-like units. Scientific thinking, if guided by knowledge of the existence of etheric forces and their action, has no need of such an interpretation of the numerical relati onships revealed in the physical world; for it knows them to be nothing but the last expression of the action of the chemical ether (hence occasio nally also called 'number-ether' by Rudolf Steiner). To do justice to the appearance of measurable numerical relationships in nature, in whatever sphere, it is necessa ry to free ourselves from the abstract conception of number which governs modern scientific thought and to replace it by a more concrete one. We shall rind that for the existence of a certain number there may"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" 259 be two quite different reasons, although th e method of establishing the number itself is the same in each case. A simp le example will illustrate this. Let us look at a number of similar objects, say a group of five apples. We observe that the relation of the number five to the group of objects in front of us is purely external and accidental. In applying to it the concep tion 'five' we combine the single objects into a group and give it a name, or numerical label, which has nothing to do with the nature of the items making up the group. This way of thinking, we may observe, is of exactly the kind which the nominalists of the Middle Ages attributed to every conception formed by the human mind. In fact, the process of counting is a process of pure abstraction. The more differentiated ar e the things which we want to combine into a group through the proce ss of counting, the further th is abstraction has to go. We can count apples and pears together unde r the collective concep tion of 'fruit'; if turnips are added, we must help ourselves out with the conception 'vegetable products'; until finally we deal only with 't hings', without considering any qualitative differentiation. Thus the conception of numb er is created solely within the human mind, which applies it to things from outside. From the moment when human consciousness was unable to attribute to itself any other than a purely nominalistic mode of comprehension it was inevitable that all explanations of natural phenomena would have two results: (1) the exclusion from observation of everything that could not be conceived in te rms of numbers, and (2) an endeavour to find for every numerical rela tionship capable of empirical proof an explanation which could be interpreted as th e result of taking qualitatively identical units and counting them. For this method of forming conceptions is the only one which nominalism can accept with a good consci ence. The fact that in so doing it is led ad absurdum has only quite lately occurred to it. For if by the logical following of this path - as in modern theoretical physic s - the whole universe is dissolved into units which can no longer be distinguished from each other, then it will become impossible to count these parts, for it cannot be es tablished whether any given one of these hypothetical elemental particles has been counted or not. None the less, Eddington claimed to have found the exact number of particles composing the universe - a number with 80 figures - by using a special calculus, but this number is valid only on the supposition that the particles can not be counted because they are indistinguishable! 9 However correct the nominalistic conception of number may be in such a case as that of numbering the five apples, it is wholly incorrect to restrict the concept of number itself to one valid for this kind of occurrenc e. We shall see this immediately if we take one of the apples and cut it across. Th ere we find the number five confronting us in the well-known star-like figure, represented by the fivefold pericarp in the centre of the apple. What man, restricted as he was to the mode of understanding, has completely overlooked is this: although the ac t of counting, by which we establish the number five, is the same in both cases, the quality of the numbe r five is totally different. For in the case of the five pericarp s this number is a quality immanent in the apple, which it shares with the whole species of Rosaceae. The apple itself is just as"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":" 260 much 'five' as it is 'round', 'sweet', etc. In the supersensible type which creates in the plant its own organ of manifestation, the creation of a number - in the apple the number five - is part of the form-creati ng activities characteristic of the type. The numerical relationships wh ich appear between natural phenomena depend upon the way in which the chemical ether participates . This is true equally of those discovered by chemistry in the sphere of inorganic matter and used to-day with such great success. Let us be quite clear that the relationship of unity to plural ity in the case of the five apples is totally different from what it is in the fivefold pericarp. In the first case unity is the smallest quantity represented by each of the five apples. There, the step from one to two is made by joining together tw o units from outside. The path from one to many is by way of continuous addition. In the second case the unity is represented by the pericarp - i.e. by the one comprising th e many, the latter appear ing as parts of the whole. In such a case two is part of one a nd so are three, four, five, etc. Plurality arises from a continuous pr ocess of division of unity. The ancient world knew the idea of number only in the last-mentioned form. There unity appeared as an all-embracing magn itude, revealed through the Universe. The world's manifoldness was felt to be not a ju xtaposition of single things, externally connected, but the content of this unity, and therefore derived from it. This was expressed by the pre-Socratic Greek philosophers in the formula ÎÎ½ ÎºÎ±Î¹ ÏÎ±Î½ (the One and the All). With the appearance of the Arabs on the scene of history, human thought turned to the additive concept of number, and the original distributive concept receded gradually into oblivion. The acceptance of the new concept made it possible for the first time to conceive the zer o. It is clear that by a conti nuous division of unity one is carried to a constantly grow ing number of constantly dimi nishing parts, but without ever reaching the nothing represented by th e number zero. To-day we should say that in this way we can reach zero only by an infini te series of steps. Yet the idea of the infinite did not exist in this form for an cient man. On the othe r hand, in the arabic conception of number the steps necessary to reach zero are finite. For just as by the external addition of unities we can step forward from one number to the next, so we can also step back on the same path by repeated subtractions of unities. Having thus reached One, nothing can stop us from going beyond it by one more such step. The arabic numeral system, therefore, is the only one to possess its own symbol for zero. It has been correctly noted th at the penetration into Eur opean thought of this additive concept of number was responsible for developing the idea of the machine; for it accustomed human beings to think calmly of zero as a quantity existing side by side with the others. In ancient man the idea of nothingness, the absolute void, created fear; he judged nature's relation to the void accordingly, as the phrase 'natura abhorret vacuum' indicates. His capacity to think f earlessly of this vacuum and to handle it thus had to be developed in order to bri ng about the Machine Age, and particularly the development of efficient steam engines. Consider also the deci sive part played by"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":" 261 the vacuum in Crookes's researches, through wh ich the path to the sub-physical realm of nature was laid open. Yet nature makes use of number as a regula ting factor in quite a different way from its appearance in the purel y electrical and gravitationa l connexions of inorganic matter, namely where sound-ether from the upper boundary of nature so regulates nature's dynamic that the manifold sens e-qualities appear in their time-and-space order. When we interpret the arrangement of numbers found there on a nominalistic basis, as is done when the axis- and angle- relationships of crysta ls are reduced to a mere propinquity of the atoms distributed like a grid in space, or when the difference in angle of the position of the various colours in the sp ectrum is reduced to mere differences in frequency of the electroma gnetic oscillations in a hypothetical ether - then we bar the way to the comprehension not only of number itself, as a quality among qualities, but also of a ll other qualities in nature. * (e) LIFE As already mentioned, the three kinds of ether, warmth, light and sound, are not sufficient in themselves to bring into existen ce what in its proper sense we call 'life' in nature, i.e. the formation of single living organisms. This requires the action of a fourth kind of ether, the life-ether, ra nged above the other three. We can best comprehend the life-ether's contribution to th e total activity of the ether in nature by considering the interac tion of the four kinds of ether with the four physical elements. We have seen that the warmth-ether ha s the double function of being at once the lowest ether and the highest physical element, thus acting as a sphere of reflexion for the other kinds of ether and the elements re spectively. Each stage in the etheric has its reflexion in the physical, as the above table shows. Thus to the physical air the etheric light is related. (The affinity of light and air is best s een in the plant and its leaf-"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" 262 formation.) To bring about real changes in the material composition of the physical world requires the stronger powers of the chem ical ether. Therefore it is also the first ether of which we had to speak as 'magical ' ether. Its effects reach into the watery element which is already bound up with gr avity, but by its own strength it cannot penetrate beyond that. The causatio n of material changes in the liquid sphere would in fact be all that these three kinds of ether could achieve together. Only when the power of the life-ether is added to the three others can etheric action reach as far as the sphere of solid matter. Thus the life-ether is responsible for all solid formation in nature, both in her organi c and inorganic fields (the latter-crystal- formation-being the effect of external ether-action). 10 It is to the action of the life- ether that nature owes the existence in her different realms of multitudes of separate solid forms. To mention an instance from our previous studies: in the same way as volcanic phenomena manifest the warmth -ether's gravity-overcoming power on a macrotelluric scale, so snow-formation illustrates the life-ether's matter-shaping might. Through its power to bind flowing action into solid form, the life-ether is related to the sound-ether in the same way as the arti culated word formed by human speaking is related to the mere musical tone. The latter by itself is as it were fluid. In human speech this fluidity is represented by the vowels. With a language consisting only of vowels man would be able to express feeli ngs, but not thoughts. To let the word as carrier of thought arise out of sound, huma n speech possesses the consonants, which represent the solid element in it. The emergence of the sense-bearing word fr om the merely ringing sound is an exact counterpart to what takes pl ace in nature when the play of organic liquids, regulated by the chemical ether, is caused by the life-et her to solidify into outwardly perceptible form. By reading in this way the special function of the life-ether among the other three, we are led to the term ' Word-ether' as an appropriate second name for it, corresponding to the term sound-et her for the chemical ether. * Thus Levity presents itself to us as being engaged in the fourfold activity of Chaoticizing, Weaving, Sounding and, lastl y, Speaking the form-creative Cosmic Word into the realm of Gravity. 1 To avoid misunderstandings, it should be emphasized that spiritual Imagination is not attained by any exercise involving directly the sense of sight and its organ, the eye, but by purely mental exercises designed to increase the 'seeing' faculty of the mind. 2 Indeed, it is a misunderstanding of the whole meaning of Anthroposophy when its contents are quoted - as they sometimes are even by adherents - in such a way as to suggest that by their help a better 'explanation' may be gained of matters for which there is otherwise no, or at least no satisfactory, explanation. The question: 'How does Anthroposophy explain this or that?' is quite wrongly put. We ought rather to ask: 'How does Anthroposophy help us to read more clearly this or that otherwise enigmatical chapter of the script of existence?'"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":" 263 3 See Space and the Light of Creation, by G.

See the opening words of the 'Prologue in Heaven\" (Faust, I) and the call of the Spirit of the Elements in the first scene of the Second Part of the drama, which follow upon the stage direction: 'The sun announces his approach with overwhelming noise.' 7 By attending Chladni's lectures on his discovery in Paris the French physicist Savart became acquainted with this phenomenon and devoted himself to its study. Chladni and Savart together published a great number of these figures. 8 Understanding the attributes of the chemical ether enables us to see in their right perspective Rudolf Steiner's suggestions to farmers for the prepara tion of the soil and for keeping healthy the crops growing on it. Attempts have been made to dismiss these suggestions by calling them 'mysticism' and 'mediaeval magic'. Both terms are titles of honour if we understand by the one the form of insight into the supersensible realm of nature acquired by the higher mode of reading, and by the other a faculty of nature herself, whose magic wand is the chemical or sound-ether. 9 See Eddington's humorous and at the same time serious treatment of this problem in his Philosophy of Physical Science. 10 Of the difference between external and internal ether-action more will be said in the concluding chapter."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" 264 CHAPTER XX Pro Anima Thy functions are ethereal, As if within thee dwelt a glancing mind, Organ of vision! And a Spirit aÃ«real Informs the cell of Hearing, dark and blind. W. WORDSWORTH (a) THE WELL-SPRINGS OF NATUR E'S DEEDS AND SUFFERINGS As our observations have shown, gravity and levity not only exist side by side as a primary polarity; the manifold interaction of their fields gives rise to all sorts of secondary polarities. Obviously, this inter action must be brought about by a further kind of force to which gravity and levity are subordinate. In what follows we shall try, so far as is possible within the sc ope of this book, to throw light on the nature of this force. Since the direct expe rience of the dynamic realm constituted by it is base d on faculties of the mind ot her than those needed for the Imaginative perception of the etheric realm, we shall have to examine also the nature and origin of these faculties. This will lead us again to the study of one of man's higher senses, this time his sense of hearing, with the aim of finding the spiritual function that is hidden in it. But our order of procedure will have to differ from the one followed in the last chapter, because it will be necessary first to make ourselves acquainted with the nature of the new force and then to turn to an examination of the sense-activity concerned. * Let our first object of observat ion be man himself in so far as he illustrates a polarity of the second order. When studying man's nature with the id ea of understanding th e genesis of his onlooker-consciousness, it will be remembere d, we had to examine the ordering of his consciousness into waking, dreaming and sleep ing in the different members of his organism. We recognized three different or ganic systems, the sensory-nerve system, the rhythmic system and the metabolic-limb system, as the bodily foundation of three different soul activities. These are th e thought-forming activity which belongs to waking consciousness; the feeling activity which belongs to dream consciousness; and the willing activity which belongs to sl eep consciousness. We then saw in these three systems representatives of the three alchemical functions - 'sulphurous' in the metabolic, 'saline' in the nervous, 'mercurial' in the mediating rhythmic system."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":" 265 Regarded thus, man's nature reveals its elf as being endowed with a physical organization, and an etheric organiza tion, which are brought into different relationships by being acted upon by a third or ganization consisting of forces of the kind here to be studied. At his lower pole these forces co-ordinate the ether and physical organizations in a manner correspond ing to the function of the 'sulphur'-pole of the alchemical triad. Here, therefore, th e warmth-ether takes the lead and acts in such a way that the higher kinds of ether ar e able to come to expression in material processes of the body. At the upper pole corresponding forces co-ordinate the physical and ether organizations in a way char acteristic of the 'salt'-pole. This gives the lead to the life-ether, so that the p hysical organism provides the foundation for the activity of the ether-f orces without, however, being act ually penetrated by them (at least after completion of the embryonic and first post-embryonic development). As a result, consciousness lights up in this part of the body. The rhythmic sphere, being the 'mercurial' middle, is distinguished by an al ternation of the two conditions described. With each diastole it becomes more akin to the pole below, and with each systole more akin to the pole above. Here, therefor e, the lighting up of consciousness is only partial. By means of these observations we realize that the third type of force, in so far as it is active in man, has the capacity, by co-ordina ting the physical and etheric parts of the organism in one way or another, to promot e happenings either of a more corporeal or a more psychical nature - namely, motion at one pole, sensation at the other, and feeling in the middle between them. 1 Remembering Goethe's formula, 'colours are deeds and sufferings of light', we realize how deeply true the concepts were to which he was led by his way of de veloping observation and thought. What we have now brought to our awaren ess by studying man, holds good in some sense also for the animal. The animal, t oo, is polarized into motion and sensation. (What makes the animal differ from man need not concern us here, for it belongs to a dynamic realm other than the one we are now studying. This other realm will come under consideration in the next chapter.) Quit e a different picture arises when we turn to the plant. The plant, too, is characterized by a threefold structure, root, stem with leaves, and florescence, which in their wa y represent the three alchemical functions. Consequently, there is also motion in the pl ant, although this is confined to internal movements leading to growth and forma tion. And at the opposite pole there is sensation, though again very different from the sensation experi enced by higher living beings. What we mean here by 'sensation' can be best expressed by quoting the following passage from Ruskin's The Queen of the Air, in which the dual activity of the dynamic which we seek to understand is brought out particularly clearly. In describing the forming of blossom in the pl ant as the climax of the 'spirit' active in it, Ruskin says: 'Its (the plant's) form b ecomes invested with aspects that are chiefly delightful to our own human passions; namely, first, with the loveliest outlines of shape and, secondly, with the most brilliant phases of the primary colours, blue, yellow, red or white, the unison of all; a nd to make it more strange, this time of peculiar and perfect glory is associated with relations of the plants or blossoms to"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" 266 each other, correspondent to the joy of love in human creatures and having the same object in the continuance of the race.' 2 If we wish to understand why the same dynamic action working on the physical and etheric organisms of the plant, on the one hand, and of man and the animal, on the other, brings about effects so different, we must turn to the realm whence this action originates in both cases. For the animal and fo r man this realm is situated within their organisms because in addition to their i ndividual physical and etheric organizations they are endowed also with an individual organization of the higher kind. Not so with the plant. For the rhythms of its growt h, the successive formation of its various organs, the production of its colours, etc., the plant depends on outer conditions. What strikes us first in this respect is th e plant's dependence on the succession of the seasons. These in turn are an outcome of the changing mutual positions of earth and sun. That which forms part of the indivi dual organism in higher living beings is located in the cosmic surroundings of the pl ant. In fact, it is our planetary system which provides the forces that stir the etheri c and physical forces of the earth to their various interactions, thus bringing about all the manifo ld secondary polarities. * Before we embark on a description of furt her phenomena which testify to the cosmic nature of the forces with which we are here concerned, it will be well (following a principle applied before) to establish the hi storical antecedents of the conception of the universe we are about to develop. We realize that the type of force with whic h we are here seeking to become familiar is the one responsible for the existence of wh at we commonly call 'soul'. The creation of a body-bound soul, however, is only one part icular form of the activity of these forces. Another is the one which we have ju st seen manifest in the plant. In yet another way the same forces function as movers and stirrers of the macro-telluric processes of the earth, and beyond this of the happenings in the body of our planetary system, including the movements of the various planets. This is an aspect which was by no means unf amiliar to ancient man. It was naturally lost when the onlooker-consciousness awoke. In this respect it is of historical significance that the same man, G. A. Borell i (1608-79), a member of the Florentine Academy, who was the first to inquire into the movements of the animal and human body from a purely mechanical point of view , made the first attempt to deduce the planetary movements from a purely physical cause. 3 Through this fact an impulse comes to expression which we may term Contra Animam, and against which we have to put our Pro Anima, in much the same way that we put our Pro Levitate against the Contra Levitatem call of the Florentine Academicians. *"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":" 267 It will help our further de scriptions if we introduce at this point the name which Rudolf Steiner adopted for the type of forces we are concerned with here. In view of the fact that their origin lies in the extr a-terrestrial realm of the universe, he called them 'astral' forces, thereby giving back to this term, also, its true and original meaning. It is under this name that we sh all speak of them henceforth. To make ourselves more familiar with the character of the astral forces, it will be well to observe them first of all in thei r macrotelluric form of activity. There is, as already mentioned, the rhythm ic occurrence of the seasons in connexion with the varying relative positions of ear th and sun. Alongside this we may put the rhythm of the tides, coincident with the pha ses of the moon. Just as the solar rhythm manifests in an alternating rise and fall of th e saps in the plants, so also does the lunar rhythm. 4 (Note how this fact actua lly vitiates the usual ex planation that the tidal rhythm of the sea is caused by a gravitati onal pull exerted by the moon's body on the oceanic water.) In neither instance is the change of position of the relevant cosmic body - in our examples that of the sun or m oon in relation to the ea rth - the 'cause' of the corresponding rhythmic events on the ea rth. Together with all other rhythmic events of equal periodicity, it is itself the effect of th e activity of a force-sphere constituting the cosmic realm to whic h the relevant planetary body belongs. From this statement three major questions aris e, which need to be answered before we can carry on our description of the astral forces themselves: Firstly, by the way we have spoken of the varying relations of the sun and moon to the earth, seeing in them the e ffects of certain astral activi ties, we have treated them as if they were of like nature, namely, resulting from a movement of the relevant heavenly body round the earth. According to the Copernican conception, however, only the moon rotates round the earth, whereas the apparent yearly progression of the sun is actually caused by the earth's motion round the sun. This ra ises the question of how far the Copernican, heliocentric aspect is valid in a science which strives to embrace the astral realm of the universe in its inquiries. Secondly, what roles do the other members of our planetary system play as compared with those of the sun and the moon? Thirdly, if it is true that the essential solar and lunar effects - and presumably the effects of the other planets - on the eart h do not spring from physical influence exerted by the visible bodies of the planet s concerned, but from certain astral force- fields of which these bodies themselves form part, what is the significance of such a body within the planet's dynamic whole? Starting with the answer to the first ques tion, we shall quote the following passage from a lecture on theoretical physics gi ven by Professor Planck in 1909 at the Columbia University, New York:"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" 268 'Only the hypothesis of the general value of the principle of Relativity in mechanics could admit the Copernican system into phys ics, since this principle guarantees the independence of all processe s on the earth from the progr essive motion of the earth. For, if we had to make allowance for this motion, then I should, for instance, have to reckon with the fact that the piece of chalk in my hand possesses the enormous kinetic energy corresponding to a velocity of about 30 km/sec.' The implications for us of these remarks by an eminent physicist can be expressed as follows: In a science which knows how to deal with movement as an event of absolute dynamic reality, the Copernican aspect lose s its significance as the only valid aspect of our cosmic system. For its applicat ion as a means of describing the dynamic happenings within this system presupposes th e acceptance of Einstein's relativistic conception of motion. Indeed, for the bu ilding up of a picture of the dynamic structure of our system, the Copern ican view-point is inadequate. This statement must not be taken to deny all justification to the heliocentric view- point. There is, after all, the fact that the orbits which th e heavenly bodies appear to follow when viewed in this way, assume a particular geometrical character which cannot be accidental. And more than that, wh en the heliocentric asp ect is seen in its true setting, it forms (as will be shown later) an extremely revealing part of the script which tells us of the nature of the astral forces. All that is required is that the heliocentric picture be taken for what it is , namely, a purely kinematic aspect of the true dynamic ordering of our cosmic system, which in itself calls for quite other means of conceptual representation. From the point of view of the astral orde r of the universe, the earth appears in the centre of a number of force-fields which penetrate each other and in their peripheral region extend beyond one another in accordan ce with the respective orbits of the various planetary bodies. How many force-fields there are, and what is the respective character of each, will become clear from the following consideration, which will also provide the answer to the s econd of our three questions. As the originator of the sec ondary polarities in earthly na ture the astral realm must undoubtedly itself be structured polarically, one part of it forming the cause of all the happenings by which levity is brought into interaction with grav ity, the other of all the happenings by which gravity is brought into interaction with le vity. There must be a further part which is responsible for th e establishment of th e 'mercurial' mean between the two poles of the s econdary polarity. This leads us to a threefold aspect of the astral realm. Closer inspection reveals a re petition of this th reefold order within each of the two polar regions. In Chapter XII we learnt to distinguish the material happenings at the two poles of the secondary polarity by obs erving their appearance in the plant as 'sublimation', on the one hand, and 'assimilation' on the other. Of the former process,"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":" 269 by which matter is carried from its gravity-bound to its gravity-free condition, we know that it takes place in three stages, of which the first implies the lifting of matter from the solid to the liquid condition, th e second from the liquid to the aeriform condition, and the third to th e condition of pure heat. There are three corresponding stages by which ether becomes susceptible to gr avity. It is in their nature that they are not in the same degree manifest as are their polar opposites. Still, properly guided observation is able to detect them and enables us to describe them as follows. At the first stage, ether, which in itself has a pur ely peripheral orientation, becomes linked to some all-relating point; at the second stage, the various ether-ac tivities, already point- related, are brought into some characteristic interrelationship so as to become the cause of a particular formative action in the material realm; at the third stage, the etheric aggregate thus organized receives the impulse to link itself with some particular portion of ponderable matter. In these six forms of astral activity, ob servation, if guided by modern spiritual science, recognizes the charac teristics of the six planetary spheres, known as 'Moon', 'Mercury', 'Venus', on the one hand, 'Saturn', 'Jupiter', 'Mars', on the other. In the same way the dynamic sphere of the 'Sun' is f ound to provide the astral activity which mediates between the two groups of planetary spheres. 5 The following observations may help us to become familiar with the different modes of activity of the force- spheres. Let us start with the astral forces corresponding to the th ree cosmic bodies nearest to the earth - Moon, Mercury, Venus. Their activ ity can be discerned, for example, by watching the successive stages of plant development - the formation of the sap- bearing parts; the flower-substance alr eady partly transformed into aeriform condition; finally the propaga ting processes which belong esse ntially to the sphere of activity of the warmth-ether. 6 In the human organism we find the same sequence in the step-by-step transformation of nutrim ent right up to the moment when earthly form passes into chaos, as we learnt previously. The so-called enzyme action, ascribed by physiology to the va rious digestive juices, is in reality the product of an activity of the lower pa rt of man's astral organization, for which the relevant juices exercise the function of physical 'carriers'. In the field of macr otelluric phenomena, the metamorphosis of the atmospheric moisture extending beyond the different cloud- stages up to the stage of pure warmth is an example of the activity of the same forces. Within all three-stage transitions of this kind, the astral forces connected with the Moon preponderate during the first stage, those connected with Mercury during the second, those connected with Venus during the third. We have already come across some examples of the outstand ing share taken by the Moon in the events of the earth's watery sphere. To these phenomena, whic h show by their rhythm their connexion with the Moon, we may add the fertility rhythm in the female human organism which coincides, not in phase but in duration, w ith the rhythm set by the Moon's course in the heavens. If we consider that the formation of a new human body in the womb needs the play of formative forces from out of the whole world environment, and that for this purpose matter must be brought in to a receptive condition for these forces,"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":" 270 then we can better understand the preparat ory part played by the Moon-forces. In order, however, that the substance of the female germ should reach that condition of chaos suitable for embryonic development, ther e is still necessary the influence of the supra-lunar astral forces. Entry for these is provided by the union of the germ-cell with the male sperm-cell. 7 As the three sub-solar planet ary spheres are responsible for events of a 'sulphurous' (radial) character, so are th e three supra-solar spheres responsible for those of a 'saline' (spherical) character. For example, we meet with Saturn-activity in everything which radiates from the human head and br ings about the hardening both of the head itself and of the entire skeleton. Observati on has shown that, even if the human being, as usually happens, stops growing in th e early twenties, so that the skeleton undergoes no further lengthening, it neverthe less reaches its final shape and its final hardening only between the twenty-eighth a nd thirtieth years. This is the time in man's life when Saturn returns for the fi rst time to the position in which it stood relatively to the earth at his birth, or, more correctly, at his conception. If the activity of the Saturn-f orce is most clearly manifest in the formation of the hard skull, that of Jupiter, the planet of 'W isdom', is shown in the formation of the complicated structure of the brain, which enables it to co-ordinate the bodily and psychic functions of the entire man. In th e realm of physical nature, man's brain is indeed the most perfect example of cosm ic Intelligence at work in a manner resembling that activity of human inte lligence which one usually understands by 'organizing'. In order that Form should come about, th e forces of Saturn are required; for the formative process to take place in Wisdom-f illed order, Jupiter's forces are necessary. If form and order are to become manifest in the realm of earthly substance, both require the assistance of Mars. We can best form an idea of the part which Mars contributes to the coming into being of the world of Form in nature if we observe what takes place when we make use of speech as a medium for expressing our thoughts. In order to be able to shape a thought we have to participate in the formative force of Saturn. We depend upon Jupiter to bring about logical connexion between the single thoughts. To announce them to the world, we need the motive force of Mars, which enables us so to set external matter in motion that it becomes a carrier and relayer of our thoughts. (We here touch upon the field of the acoustic movements of the air which will occupy us more closely later on.) Many examples of the activity of the force- spheres represented by the three exterior planets are to be found also in nature external to man. From the realm of plant life we may take the woody and bark-like formation of the trees as representing the operation of Saturn-forces. Similarly, all that goes on in the organizing of the single leaf, and particularly in the organization of the c ountless separate leaves which make up the foliage of a tree into a unifie d whole, the characteristic crow n of a tree, is an example of the work of Jupiter. Both activities are assisted by the force of Mars, which directs them from the cosmic periphery toward the single physical object."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":" 271 Between the two groups of astral force opera ting in this manner, the Sun acts as a mediating element through its double functi on of supporting the activity of the three lower planets by means of its heat and of conveying to the earth, through its light, the forces of the three higher planets. In the human microcosm the Sun-forces accomplish a corresponding task by means of the influences which ra diate from the heart through the body along the paths taken by the blood. * In what follows we shall point to a gr oup of phenomena which show the astral interconnexion between earth a nd universe; we owe our knowledge of them to Rudolf Steiner. It is due to him, also, that experimental research into the relevant facts became possible. They concern the reflexion of the various planetary movements, observable in the sky, in the behaviour of certain mineral substa nces of the earth. In connexion with our discussion of electric ity (Chapter XIII) we spoke of the special function of the metals as bearers of the 'mercurial' quality (in the alchemical sense of the term). As one of the characteristics wh ich reveal this func tion we mentioned the peculiar capacity of metals to behave as 'solid fluids'. This exceptional place among the mineral substances of the earth, the meta ls owe to their close association with the extra-terrestrial astral for ces of the world. In this field, too, modern spiritual investigation has recovered something wh ich was known to people of old - that among the metals there are seven which have a distinctive character, for each stands in a special relation to one of the seven planets (that is, th e planetary force-spheres) of our cosmic system. This is shown in the following table: Saturn Lead Jupiter Tin Mars Iron Sun Gold Venus Copper Mercury Quicksilver Moon Silver As compared with these seven, the other metals are products of combinations of various planetary forces. A comparison of the role of Saturn as the outermost planet of our cosmic system with the role played by its metal, lead, as a final product of radioactive disintegratio n, leads one to conceive of the radioactive sphere of the earth as being related especially to the planets outside the orbit of Sa turn, namely, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. Thanks to the work of L. Kolisko who, in following Rudolf Steiner's indications, observed for many years the behaviour of th e seven metals singly and in combination by submitting their salts to certa in capillary effects, we know to-day that the\" earth bears in her womb substances whose dynami c condition follows exactly the events in the planetary realm of the universe. 8 "},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" 272 * The picture of the universe which has thus ar isen before our mind's eye is a startling one only so long as we keep comparing it with its heliocentric predecessor. How wrong it would be to regard it as someth ing inconceivable for the modern mind, is shown by the fact that the modern physiologi st has already been driven to form quite a similar picture of the human organism, as far as it concerns glandular action in this organism. His observations have taught hi m to distinguish between the gland as a spatially limited physical organ and the gland as a functional sphere, and to conceive of the latter as the essential gland. Seen t hus, 'the spatial and te mporal dimensions of each gland are equal to those of the entire or ganism' (A. Carrel). In this way we come to see the human organism as a realm of interpenetrating sphe res of distinctive physiological activities. Each of these activities is an chored somewhere in the physical body by the anatomically discerni ble gland-body, and the latter's relationship to the functional sphere is such that a gl and's 'physiological individuality is far more comprehensive than its anatomical individuality'. We need only translate this statement in to its macrocosmic counterpart to obtain another statement which expre sses fittingly the relationshi p of the visible body of a planet to the functional (astral) sphere indicated by its orbit. Then we shall say that 'a planet's astral individuality is far mo re comprehensive than its astronomical individuality'. It should be observed that the step we have here taken, by using a conception obtained through microcosmic observation to he lp us to find the answer to a question put to us by the macrocosm, complies with one of the fundamentals of our method of research, namely, to allow 'the heavens to explain the earth, and the earth the heavens' (R. St.). * * * ( b ) HEARING AS DEED In the introductory part of the last chapte r we said that we have the right to employ results of investigation carri ed out by higher faculties of spiritual perception without contradicting our principle of seeking to understand the phenomenal world by reading it, provided our doing so helps to enhan ce our own reading activity, and provided it can be shown that the acquisition of the hi gher faculties of perception is a direct continuation of the training we have to apply to our mind and senses to make them capable of such reading. As regards the forc es of astral characte r, the first of these two conditions has been fulfilled by the obser vations we have already worked through in this chapter. We have still to show that the second condition is equally fulfilled. The faculty of the mind which permits direct investigation of the astral realm was called (spiritual) Inspiration by Rudolf Steine r, who thereby restored to this term,"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":" 273 also, its proper meaning. We have already in dicated that this fa culty resides in the sense of hearing in the same way that the faculty of Imagination - as we have found - resides in the sense of seeing. In order to understand w hy it is this particular sense which comes into consideration here, we have to consider that the phenomena through which the astral world manifests most directly are all of a rhythmic nature. Now, the sense through which our soul penetr ates with direct experience into some outer rhythmic activity is the sense of h earing, our aural perceptions being conveyed by certain rhythmic movements of the air. In what follows we shall see how the study of both the outer acoustic phenomena and our own psycho-physical make-up in the region of the acoustic sense, leads to an unde rstanding of the nature of Inspiration and of how it can be trained. * Among all our sense-perceptions, sound is uni que in making itself perceptible in two quite different ways - via the ear as a direct sense experience and via the eye (potentially also via the se nses of touch and movement) in the form of certain mechanical movements, such as those of a string or a tuning fork. Hence the world- spectator, as soon as he began to investigat e acoustic phenomena scientifically, found himself in a unique position. In all other fiel ds of perception, with the exception of the purely mechanical processes, the transition to non-stereoscopic colourless observation had the effect that the world- content of the naive consciousness simply ceased to exist, leaving the ensuing hiatus to be filled in by a pattern of imagined kinematic happenings - for example, colour by 'ether'-vibrations, heat by molecular movements. Not so in the sphere of acoustics . For here a part of the entire event, on account of its genuine kinetic character, remains a content of actual observation. In consequence, the science of acoustics became for the scientific mind of man a model of the required division between th e 'subjective' (that is, for scientific considerations non-existent) a nd the 'objective' (that is, th e purely kinematic) part of observation. The field of aural percepti on seemed to justify the procedure of collecting a mass of phenomena, stripped of all that is experienced by man's soul in meeting them, and of assembling them unde r a purely abstract concept, 'sound'. Professor Heisenberg, in hi s lecture (quoted at the be ginning of Chapter II) on the way in which the scientific interrogation of nature has deliberately limited itself, draws attention to the fact th at a full knowledge of the scie nce of optics in its present form might be acquired merely through theoretical study by one born blind, yet without his ever getting to know what light is. Heisenberg could, of course, have said the same of the science of acoustics in regard to one bor n deaf. But we can go a step further by asking how far a deaf and a blind person could get towards establishing the respective science. The answer must be th at, whereas the person lacking sight would not of himself be in a positi on to establish a scie nce of optics, it would be well within the scope of the deaf man to establish a science of acoustics. For all the processes essential to a physical acoustics are accessible to the eye and other senses."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":" 274 In order to make our experience of hear ing a finger-post pointing the way to an understanding of the faculty of Inspiration innate in man, we must first of all seek to transform acoustics from a 'deaf into a 'heari ng' science, just as Goethe turned the theory of colour from a colour-b lind into a colour-seeing science. * Following our procedure in the case of optic s, we select from the total field of acoustic phenomena a defined realm specially suited to our purpos e. As it was then the spectrum, so it will be now the so-called quality of sound, or tone-colour. By this term in acoustics is understood a property possessed by sound apart from pitch and volume, and dependent on the nature of the source from which a tone is derived. It is the tone-col our by which the tone of a violin, for instance, is distinguished from a tone of equal intens ity and pitch produced by a flute. Similarly, two musical instruments of the same kind are distinguished from each other by tone- colour. Tone-colour plays a specially significant part in human and animal voices. Not only has each individual voice its unique colour, bu t the colour varies in one and the same person or animal, according to the prevailing mood. Moreover, by uttering the various vowels of his language, man is able to impa rt varying colour to the sounds of his speech. For the difference we experience when a tone is sung on the vowel 'a' or the vowel 'e', etc., derives from the particular colour given by the vowel to that tone. Among the discoveries of the last century in the realm of acoustics, there is one which especially helped to establish a purely kinematic conception of sound. Helmholtz showed that tones which to our ears seem to have a clear and definite pitch may be split up by a series of resonators into a number of different tones, each of them sounding at a different pitch. Th e lowest of these has the pitch which our ears attach to the entire tone. Thus in any ordina ry tone there may be distinguished a 'fundamental' tone and a series of 'overt ones'. Helmholtz further showed that the particular series of overtones into which a to ne can be resolved is responsible for the colour of that tone as a whole. Natura lly, this meant for the prevailing mode of thinking that the experience of the colour of a tone had to be inte rpreted as the effect of a kind of acoustical adding together of a number of si ngle tone perceptions (very much as Newton had interpreted 'white' li ght as the outcome of an optical adding together of a certain number of single colour perceptions). The picture becomes different if we apply to the aural experience Goethe's theorem that, in so far as we are deluded, it is not by our senses but by our own reasoning. For we then realize that sounds never occur of themselves without some tone-colour, whilst physically 'pure' tones - those that represent simple harmonic motions - exist only as an artificial laboratory product. The colo ur of a tone, therefore, is an integral part of it, and must not be conceived of as an additiona l attribute resulting from a summing up of a number of colourless tone experiences."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":" 275 Further, if we compare our experiences of the two kinds of tone, they tell us that through the quality or colour of the natural tone something of a soul-nature, pleasant or unpleasant, speaks to us, whereas 'pur e' tones have a soulless character. Resolving normal tones by Helmholtz's met hod (useful as it is for certain purposes) amounts to something like disse cting a living, ensouled orga nism into its members; only the parts of the corp se remain in our hands. * Having thus established that the psychic content of aural experience forms an integral part of the tone-phenomenon as such, we must seek to understand how the kinetic process which is indispensable for its appearance comes to be the vehicle for the manifestation of 'soul' in the manner described. To this end we must first of all heed the fact that the movement which mediates aural sensation is one of alternating expansion and contraction. Expressed in the language of the four Elements, this means that th e air thus set in vibration approaches alternately the condition of th e watery element beneath it and of the element of fire (heat) above it. Thus, in a regular rhythm , the air comes near the border of its ponderable existence. Purely physical considerat ions make us realize that this entails another rhythmic occurrence in the realm of heat. For with each expansion of the air heat is absorbed by it and thereby rendere d space-bound, while with every contraction of the air heat is set free and returns to its indigenous condition - that is, it becomes free from spatial limitations. This picture of the complete happenings during an acoustic event enables us to understand how such a process can be th e vehicle for conveying certain astral impulses in such a way that, when met by them, we grow aware of them in the form of a direct sensation. Taking as a mode l the expression 'transparent' for the perviousness of a substance to light, we ma y say that the air, when in a state of acoustic vibration, becomes 'trans-audient' for astral impulses, and that the nature of these vibrations determines which particular impulses are let through. What we have here found to be the true role of the kinetic part of the acoustic process applies equally to sounds which are emitted by living beings, and to those that arise when lifeless material is set mechanically in motion, as in the cas e of ordinary noises or the musical production of tone. There is on ly this difference: in the first instance the vibrations of the sound-producing organs have their origin in the activity of the astral part of the living being, and it is th is activity which comes to the recipient's direct experience in the form of aural impr essions; in the second instance the air, by being brought externally into a state of vibration, exerts a kind of suction on the astral realm which pervades the air, with the re sult that parts of this realm become physically audible. For we are constan tly surrounded by supersensible sounds, and the state of motion of the air determines wh ich of them become perceptible to us in our present state of consciousness."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":" 276 At this point our mind turns to a happening in the macrotelluric sphere of the earth, already considered in anothe r connexion, which now assume s the significance of an ur-phenomenon revealing the astral genera tion of sound. This is the thunder-storm, constituted for our external perception by the two events: lightning and thunder. Remembering what we have found earlier (Cha pter X) to be the nature of lightning, we are now in a position to say: a supraterre strial astral impulse obtains control of the earth's etheric and physical spheres of force in such a way that etheric substance is thrown into the condition of space-bound physic al matter. This substance is converted by stages from the state of light and heat via that of air into the liquid and, in certain cases, into the solid state (hail). To this we now add that, while in lightning the first effect of the etheric-physical interference of the astral impulse appears before our eyes, our ears give us direct awareness of this impulse in the form of thunder. It is this fact which accounts for the awe-insp iring character of thunderstorms. * The picture we have thus received of th e outer part of the acoustic process has a counterpart in the processes inside the or gan of hearing. Hearing, like seeing, depends upon the co-operation of both poles of the human organism-nerve and blood. In the case of hearing, however, they play a reversed role. In the eye, the primary effect of light-impressions is on the nervous part; a secondary response to them comes from the blood organization. In the ear, the recep tive organ for the astral impulses pressing in upon it is a part which belongs to the body's limb system, while it is the nervous organization which functions as the organ of response. For in the ear the sound-waves are first of all taken over by the so-called ossicles, three small bones in the middle ear which, when examined with the Goethean eye, appear to be a complete metamorphosis of ah arm or a leg. They ar e instrumental in transferring the outer acoustic movements to the fluid containe d in the inner ear, whence these are communicated to the entire fluid system of the body and lastly to the muscular system. 9 We shall speak of this in detail later on. Let it be stat ed here that the peculiar role played by the larynx in hearing, alre ady referred to by us in Chapter XVI, is one of the symptoms which tells of the participation of the muscular system in the internal acoustic process. Psychologically, the difference between ear a nd eye is that aural perceptions work much more directly on the human will - that is, on the part of our astral organization connected with the lim b system. Whereas eye-impression s stimulate us in the first place to think, ear-impressions stimulate us to ... dance. The whole art of dancing, from its original sacred ch aracter up to its degenerate modern forms, is based upon the limb system being the re cipient of acoustic impressions. In order to understand how the muscles re spond to the outer astral impulses which reach us through our ear, we must first unders tand what happens in the muscles when our will makes use of them for bodily motion. In this case, too, the muscular system is the organ through which certain astral im pulses, this time arising out of the body's"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":" 277 own astral member, come to expression. Mo reover, the movement of the muscles, though not outwardly perceptible, is quite si milar to acoustic movements outside the body. For whenever a muscle is caused to al ter its length, it will pe rform some kind of vibration - a vibration characterized even by a definite pitch, which differs in different people. Since throughout life our body is ne ver entirely without movement, we are thus in a constant state of inward soundi ng. The muscular system is capable of this vibration because during the body's initial period of growth the bones increase in length to a much greater extent than do the sinews and muscles. Hence the latter arrive at a condition of elastic tension not unlike that of the strings of a musical instrument. 10 In the case of bodily movement, therefore, the muscles are tone-producers, whereas in acoustic perceptions they are tone-receivers. What, then, is it that prevents an acoustic perception from actually setting the li mbs in motion, and, instead, enables our sentient being to take hold of the astral impulse invading our muscles? This impediment comes from the contribu tion made by the nervous system to the auditory process. In order to understand th e nature of this contribution we must remember the role played by the blood in se eing. It was found by us to consist in the bringing about of that state of equilibrium without whic h we should experience light merely as a pain-producing agent. Sim ilarly, the perception of sound requires the presence of a certain state of equilibrium between the nerve-system and the limb- system. In this case, however, a lack of equilibrium would result not in pain, but in ecstasy. For if acoustic impressions played directly into our limb-system, with nothing to hold them in check, every tone we encounter would compel us to an outward manifestation of astr al activity. We should become part of the tone-process itself, forced to transform it by the voliti onal part of our astral organization into spatial movement. That this does not happe n is because the participation of the nervous system serves to damp down the potential ecstasy. Hence it is more or less left to the sentient part of the astral organization - that is, the part free from the physical body - to partake in the astral processes underlying the tone occurrences. * Our discussion has reached a point where we are able to answer a question which first arose in the course of our study of the f our ethers, and which arises here anew. In studying the chemical or sound ether we were faced with the fact that part of the etheric realm, although in itsel f accessible to the spiritual pa rt of the sense of sight, offers supersensible experience comparab le to the perception of sound. Conversely, we are now met by the fact that it is sp iritual hearing which gives access to the immediate perception of a realm of forces which is not only the source of acoustic phenomena, but the origin of all that manife sts in nature in the form of sulphurous, saline and mercurial events, such as the wo rld of colours, electricity, magnetism, the manifold rhythmic occurrences on the earth (both taken as a whole .and in single"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" 278 organisms), etc. - all of which are taken hol d of by quite other senses than that of hearing. At our first encounter with this problem we remarked that in the supersensible no such sharp distinctions exist between di fferent sense-spheres as are found in body- bound sense-perception. At the same time we remembered that even in physical perception we are inclined to attach ac oustic attributes to colours and optical attributes to tones. In fact, it was precis ely an instance of this kind of experience, namely, our conception of tone-colour, wh ich gave us our lead in discussing the acoustic sphere in general. Our picture of the particular interac tion of the two polar bodily systems in the acts of seeing and h earing now enables us to understand more clearly how these two sphere s of perception overlap in man. For we have seen how the system which in seeing is the receiving organ, works in hearing as the responding one, and vice versa. As a result, optic al impressions are accompanied by dim sensations of sound, and aural impre ssions by dim sensations of colour. What we are thus dimly aware of in physical sense activity, becomes definite experience when the supersensible part of the senses concerned can work unfettered by the bodily organ. Clear testimony of this is again given to us by Traherne in a poem entitled Dumnesse. This poem contains an account of Traherne's recollection of the significant fact that the transition from the cosmic to the earthly condition of his consciousness was caused by his learning to speak. The following is a passage from the description of the impressions which we re his before his soul was overcome by this change: 'Then did I dwell within a World of Light Distinct and Seperat from all Mens Sight, Where I did feel strange T houghts, and such Things see That were, or seemd, only reveald to Me ... '... A Pulpit in my Mind A Temple, and a Teacher I did find, With a large Text to comment on. No Ear, But Eys them selvs were all the Hearers there. And evry Stone, and Evry Star a Tongue, And evry Gale of Wind a Curious Song .' 11 * We have obtained a sufficiently clear pict ure of the organization of our sense of hearing to see where the way lies that leads from hearing with the ears of the body to hearing with the ears of the spirit, that is , to the inspirative perception of the astral world. In the psycho-physical condition which is characteristic of our present day- consciousness, the participation of our astr al organization in any happenings of the"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":" 279 outer astral world depends on our corporeal motor system being stimulated by the acoustic motions of the air, or of some other suitable medium contacting our body. For it is only in this way that our astral organization is brought into the sympathetic vibrations necessary for perceiving outer astr al happenings. In order that astral events other than those manifesting acoustically may become accessible to our consciousness, our own astral being must b ecome capable of vibrating in tune with them, just as if we were hearing them - that is, we must be able to rouse our astral forces to an activity similar to that of hearing, yet without any physical stimulus. The way to this consists in tr aining ourselves to experience the deeds and sufferings of nature as if they were the deed s and sufferings of a beloved friend. It is thus that we shall learn to hear the s oul of the universe direct ly speaking to us, as Lorenzo divined it, when his love for Jessica made him feel in love with all the world, and he exclaimed: 'There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st But in his motion like an angel sings, Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubim, - Such harmony is in immortal souls. But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.' * * * (c) KEPLER AND THE 'MUS IC OF THE SPHERES' 'One must choose one's saints .. . and so I have chosen mine, and before all others, Kepler. In my ante-room he has ever a niche of his own, with his bust in it.' This opinion of Goethe's must surprise us in view of the fact that Kepler was the discoverer of the three laws called after him, one of which is supposed to have laid the foundation for Newton's mechanical concepti on of the universe. In what follows it will be shown how wrong it is to see in Kepler a forerunner of the mechanistic conception of the world; how near, in realit y, his world-picture is to the one to which we are led by working along Goetheanistic li nes; and how right therefore Goethe was in his judgment on Kepler. Goethe possessed a sensitive organ for the hi storical appropriateness of human ideas. As an illustration of this it may be mentioned how he reacted when someone suggested to him that Joachim Jungius - an outstanding German thinker, contemporary of Bacon, Van Helmont, etc. - had anticipated his idea of the metamorphosis of the plant. This remark worried Goethe, not because he could not endure the thought of being anticipated (s ee his treatment of K. F. Wolff), but because this would have run counter to th e meaning of man's historical development as he saw it. 'Why do I regard as essentia l the question whether Jungius conceived the"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" 280 idea of metamorphosis as we know it? My answ er is, that it is mo st significant in the history of the sciences, when a penetrating and vitalizing maxim come s to be uttered. Therefore it is not only of importance that Jungius has not expressed this maxim; but it is of highest significance th at he was positively unable to express it - as we boldly assert.' 12 For the same reason Goethe knew it would be historically unjustif ied to expect that Kepler could have conceived an aspect of the universe implicit in his own conception of nature. Hence it did not disturb him in his admiration for Kepler, that through him the Copernican aspect of the universe had become finally established in the modern mind - that is, an aspect which, as we have seen, is invalid as a means of forming a truly dynamic concep tion of the world. In forming his picture of the universe, it is true, Copernicus was concerned with nothing but the spatial movements of the luminous entities discernible in the sky, without any regard to their actual nature and dynamic interrelationships. Hence his world-picture - as befits the spectator -form of human consciousness which was coming to birth in his own time - is a purely kinematic one. As such it has validity for a certain sphere of human observation. When Kepler, against the hopes of his forerunner and friend, Tycho Brahe, accepted the heliocentric standpoint and made it the ba sis of his observations, he did so out of his understanding of what was th e truth for his own time. Ke pler's ideal was to seek after knowledge through pure observation. In this respect Goethe took him as his model. Kepler's discoveries were a proof that man's searching mind is given insight into great truths at any stage of its deve lopment, provided it keeps to the virtue of practising pure observation. It has been the error of Newton and his successors up to our own day, to try to conceive the world dynamically within the limits of their spectator-consciousness and thus to form a dynamic interpretation of th e universe based on its heliocentric aspect. This was just as repellent to Goethe as Kepler's attitude was attractive. But by so sharply distinguishing between Newton and Kepler, do we not do injustice to the fact that, as the worl d believes, Kepler's third law is the parent of Newton's law of gravitation? The following will show that this belief is founded on an illusory conception of the kind we met before. As we shall see, Kepler's discovery, when treated in a Keplerian way, instead of leading to Newton, is found to be in full agreement with the very world-picture to which our own observations have led us. * It is an established convic tion of the mathematical scientist that, once an observed regularity in nature has been expressed as a mathematical equation, this equation may be transformed in any mathematically valid way, and the resulting formula will still apply to some existing fact in the world. On innumerable occasions this principle has"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":" 281 been used in the expectation of providing furt her insight into the secrets of nature. We came across a typical instance of this in di scussing the basic theorem of kinematics and dynamics (Chapter VIII). Another exam ple is Newton's treatment of Kepler's third law, or - more precisely - the way in which Newton's law of gravitation has been held to confirm Kepler's observations, and vice versa, It will be our task to analyse the Ke pler-Newton case on the very lines of our treatment of the two parallelogram theorems. This analysis will give us insight into a truth which we have to regard as one of th e basic maxims of the new science. It says that whether a given formula, derived math ematically from one that was first read from nature, still expresses some fact of nature, cannot be decided by pure mathematical logic, but only by testin g it against truly observable phenomena. Through Kepler's third law a certain rela tion is expressed be tween the spatial dimensions of the different planetary sphe res and the time needed by the relevant planet to circle once round the circumferen ce of its own sphere. It says: 'The squares of the periodic times of the planets are al ways in the same proportion as the cubes of their mean distances from the sun.' In mathematical symbols this reads: t 1 2 / t 2 2 = r 1 3 / r 2 3 We shall see later how Kepler arrived at this law. The point is th at there is nothing in it which is not accessible to pure observati on. Spatial distances and lengths of time are measured and the results compared. Nothing, for instance, is said about the dynamic cause of the movements. The assertion is restricted - and this is true also of the first and second law - to a purely kinematic content, and so precisely to what the earthly onlooker can apprehend. Now it is said that Kepler's third law is a necessary consequence of Newton's law of gravitat ion, and that - since it is based on pure observation - it therefore es tablishes the truth of Ne wton's conception. In this assertion we encounter a misconception exactly like the one in the statement that the theorem of the parallelogram of forces follows by logical necessity from the theorem of the parallelogram of velocities. For: (a) The law of gravitation itself derives fr om Newton's formula for the centripetal force acting at a point which moves along a ci rcle, this formula being itself the result of an amplification of the formula for centr ipetal acceleration by th e factor 'mass' (as if the latter were a pure number): Centripetal acceleration: a = 4 Ï 2 r / t 2 Centripetal force: P = am = 4 Ï 2 mr / t 2 (b) The formula for centripetal accelerati on - and the concept of such acceleration itself - is the result of splitting circular movement into two rectilinear movements, one in the direction of the tangent, the other in the direction of the ra dius, and of regarding it - by a mode of reasoning t ypical of spectator-thinking - as composed of the two."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":" 282 This procedure, however, useful as it may be for the purpose of calculation, is contrary to observation. For, as we have poi nted out earlier, observation tells us that all original movement - and what can be more original than the movements of the planetary bodies - is curvilinear. No insi ght into the dynamic reality of cosmic movement, therefore, can ever be gained by handling it mathematically in this way. (c) The transformation of Kepler's formula wh ich is necessary in order to give it a form representing the nucleus of Ne wton's formula, is one which, though mathematically justified, deprives Kepler's formula of any signi ficance as expression of an observed fact. The follo wing analysis will show this. Kepler's formula- r 1 3 / r 2 3 = t 1 2 / t 2 2 may be written also r 1 3 / t 1 2 = r 2 3 / t 2 2 and this again in the generalized form: r 3 / t 2 = c . Obviously, by each of these steps we diminish the reality-value of the formula. In its original form, we find spatial extensi on compared with spatial extension, and temporal extension with temporal extensi on. Each of the two comparisons is a fully concrete one, because we compare entities of like nature, and only then test the ratios of the two - that is, two pure numbers ag ainst each other - to find that they are identical. To compare a spatial and a tem poral magnitude, as is done by the formula in its second form, requires already a certa in degree of abstrac tion. Still, it is all spectator's work, and for the spectator time is conceivable and measurable only as a rate of spatial displacement. Hence the constant number c, by representing the ratio between the spatial extension of the realm in side a planet's orbit and the time needed by it to perform one round on this orbit - a ratio which is the same for all planets - represents a definite structural element of our cosmic system. By this last operation our equation has now achieved a form which requires only one more transformation to bring it into line with Newton's formula. Instead of writing: r 3 / t 2 = c we write: r / t 2 = c (1 / r 2 ) All that now remains to be done amounts to an amplification of this equation by the factor 4 Ï 2 m, and a gathering of the constant product 4 Ï 2 c under a new symbol, for which we choose the letter f . In this way we arrive at: 4 Ï 2 mr / t 2 = 4 Ï 2 cm / r 2 and finally: P = ... = fm / r 2 which is the expression of the gravitationa l pull believed to be exerted by the sun on the various planetary bodies. Nothing can be said against this procedure from the point of view"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":" 283 of mathematical logic. For the latter the equation r / t 2 = c (1 / r 2 ) is still an expression of Kepler's observation. Not so for a logic which tries to keep in touch with concrete reality. For what m eaning, relevant to the phenomenal universe as it manifests in space and time to physical perception, is there in stating - as the equation in this form does - that: the ratio between a planet's distance from the sun and the square of its period is always propor tional to the reciprocal value of the area lying inside its orbit? * Once we have rid ourselves of the false conception that Kepler's law implies Newton's interpretation of the physical universe as a dynamic entity ruled by gravity, and gravity alone, we are free to ask what this law can tell us about the nature of the universe if in examining it we try to re main true to Kepler's own approach. To behave in a Keplerian (and thus in a Goethean) fashion regarding a mathematical formula which expresses an observed fact of nature, does not mean that to submit such a formula to algebraic transformation is altogether impermissible. All we have to make sure of is that the transformation is required by the obser ved facts themselves: for instance, by the need for an even clearer manifestation of their ideal content. Such is indeed the case with the equation which em bodies Kepler's third law. We said that in its original form this equation contains a concrete statement because it expresses comparisons between spatial extensions , on the one hand, and between temporal extensions, on the other. Now, in the form in which the spatial magnitudes occur, they express something which is directly conceiva ble. The third power of a spatial distance (r 3 ) represents the measure of a volume in three-dimensional space. The same cannot be said of the temporal magnitudes on the other side of the equation ( t 2 ). For our conception of time forbids us to connect any concrete idea with 'squared time'. We are therefore called upon to find out what form we can give this side of the equation so as to express the time-factor in a manner which is in accord with our conception of time, that is, in linear form. 13 This form readily suggests itself if we consider that we have here to do with a ratio of squares. For such a ratio may be resolved into a ratio of two simple ratios. In this way the equation - r 1 3 / r 2 3 = t 1 2 / t 2 2 assumes the form- r 1 3 / r 2 3 = ( t 1 / t 2 ) / ( t 2 / t 1 ) The right-hand side of the e quation is now constituted by the double ratio of the linear values of the periods of two planets, and th is is something with which we can connect a quite concrete idea. To see this, let us choose the periods of tw o definite planets - sa y, Earth and Jupiter. For these the equation assumes the following fo rm ('J' and 'E' indicating 'Jupiter' and 'Earth' respectively):"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" 284 r J 3 / r E 3 = ( t J / t E ) / ( t E / t J ) Let us now see what meaning we can attach to the two expressions t J / t E and t E / t J . During one rotation of Jupiter round the sun the earth circles 12 times round it. This we are wont to express by saying that Jup iter needs 12 earth-years for one rotation; in symbols: t J / t E = 12 / 1 To find the analogous expressi on for the reciprocal ratio: t E / t J = 1 / 12 we must obviously form the concept 'Jup iter-year', which covers one rotation of Jupiter, just as the concept 'earth-year' c overs one rotation of the earth (always round the sun). Measured in this time-scale, the ea rth needs for one of her rotations 1 / 12 of a Jupiter-year. With the help of these concepts we are now able to express the double ratio of the planetary periods in the following simplifie d way. If we suppose the measuring of the two planetary periods to be carried out not by the same time-scale, but each by the time-scale of the other, the formula becomes: r J 3 / r E 3 = ( t J / t E ) / ( t E / t J ) = period of Jupiter measured in Earth-years / period of Earth measured in Jupiter-years . Interpreted in this manner, Kepler's third law discloses an intimate interrelatedness of each planet to all the others as co-membe rs of the same cosmic whole. For the equation now tells us that the solar time s of the various pl anets are regulated in such a way that for any two of them the ratio of these times, measured in their mutual time- units, is the same as the ratio of the sp aces swept out by their (solar) orbits. Further, by having the various times of its members thus tuned to one another, our cosmic system shows itself to be ordered on a principle which is essentially musical. To see this, we need only recall that the mu sical value of a given tone is determined by its relation to other tones, whether they sound together in a chord, or in succession as melody. A 'C' alone is musically undefine d. It receives its character from its interval-relation to some other tone, say, 'G', together with which it forms a Fifth. As the lower tone of this interval, 'C' bears a definite character; and so does 'G' as the upper tone. Now we know that each interval represents a definite ratio between the periodicities of its two tones. In the case of the Fifth the ratio is 2: 3 (in the natural scale). This means that the lower tone receives its char acter from being related to the upper tone by the ratio 2:3. Similarly, the upper tone receives its character from the ratio 3:2. The specific character of an interval arising out of the merging of its two tones, therefore, is determined by the ratio of their ratios. In th e case of the Fifth this is 4:9. It is this ratio, therefore, which underl ies our experience of a Fifth."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":" 285 The cosmic factor corresponding to the periodic ity of the single tone in music is the orbital period of the single planet. To the musical in terval formed by two tones corresponds the double ratio of the periods of any two planets. Regarded thus, Kepler's law can be expressed as follows: The spatial ordering of our planetary system is determined by the interval-relat ion in which the different planets stand to each other. By thus unlocking the ideal content hidden in Kepler's third law, we are at the same time enabled to do justice to the way in wh ich he himself announced his discovery. In textbooks and encyclopaedias it is usually said that the disc overy of the third law was the surprising result of Kepler's fantas tic attempt to prove by external observation what was once taught in the school of Pyth agoras, namely, that (in Wordsworth's language): 'By one pervading spirit Of tones and numbers all things are controlled.' Actually, Kepler's great work, Harmonices Mundi, in the last part of which he announces his third law, is entirely devoted to proving the truth of the Pythagorean doctrine that the universe is ordered accord ing to the laws of music. This doctrine sprang from the gift of sp iritual hearing still possessed by Pythagoras, by which he could perceive the harmonies of the spheres. It was the aim of his school to keep this faculty alive as long as possible, and with its aid to establish a communicable world- conception. The Pythagorean teaching became the foundation of all later cosmological thinking, right up to the age wh ich was destined to bring to birth the spectator-relationship of man's consciousne ss with the world. Thus it was left to Copernicus to give mankind the first truly non-Pythagorea n picture of the universe. When Kepler declared himself in favour of the heliocentric as pect, as indicated by Copernicus, he acknowledged th at the universe had grown dumb for man's inner ear. Yet, besides his strong impulse to meet the true needs of his time, there were inner voices telling him of secrets that we re hidden behind the veil woven by man's physical perceptions. One of these secrets was the musical order of the world. Such knowledge, however, could not induce him to tu rn to older world-conceptions in his search for truth. He had no need of them, because there was yet another voice in him which told him that the spiritual order of the world must somehow manifest itself in the body of the world as it lay open to physical perception. Just as a musical instrument, if it is to be a perfect means of bringing forth music, must bear in its build the very laws of music, so must the body of the universe, as the instrument on which the harmonies of the spheres play their sp iritual music, bear in its proportions a reflexion of these harmonies. Kepler was sure that investigation of the world's body, provided it was carried out by means of pure observation, must needs lead to a re- establishment of the ancient truth in a fo rm appropriate to the modern mind. Thus Kepler, guided by an ancient spiritual con ception of the world, could devote himself to confirming its truth by the most up-to-d ate methods of research. That his search was not in vain, our examinati on of the third law has shown."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" 286 One thing, however, remains surprising - th at Kepler announced his discovery in the form in which it has henceforth engraved itself in the modern mind, while refraining from that analysis of it which we have a pplied to it here. Yet, in this respect also Kepler proves to have remained true to hi mself. There is, on the one hand, the form in which Kepler pronounced his disc overy; there is, on the other, the context in which he made this pronouncement. We have already po inted out that the third law forms part of Kepler's comprehensive work, Harmonices Mundi. To the modern critic's understanding it appears there like an erratic block. For Ke pler this was different. While publishing his discovery in precisely the form in which it is conceived by a mind bent on pure observation, he gave it a sett ing by which he left no doubt as to his own conception of its ideal content. And as a warning to the future reader not to overlook the message conveyed by this arrange ment, he introduced the section of his book which contains the announcement of the law, with the mysterious words about himself: 'I have stolen the golden vessels of the Egyptians from which to furnish for my God a holy shrine far from Egypt's confines.' 1 We must here distinguish sensation from feeling proper, in which sensation and motion merge in mercurial balance. 2 Note how for Ruskin the gulf which for the onlooker-consciousness lies between subject and object is bridged here - as it was for Goethe in his repr esentation of the physico-moral effect of colour. 3 De motu animalium and Theoria mediceorum planetarum ex causis physicis deducta. 4 Knowledge of this biological rhythm is still pres erved among native peoples to-day and leads them to take account of the phases of the moon in their treatment of plants. A cosmic nature-wisdom of this kind has been reopened for us in modern form by Rudolf Steiner, and has since found widespread practical application in ag riculture. See L. Kolisko, The Moon and Plant Growth. 5 In the order of names given above we follow the ancient usage for the two planets nearest to the sun, not the reversed order in which they are used to-day. This is necessary in a cosmology which aspires at a qualitative understanding of the universe, in view of the qualities represented by these names. Note also the absence of the three most distant planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. They are not to be considered as parts of the indigenous astral structure of our cosmic system - any more than radioactivity is an original feature of the earth. 6 Note the 'Venus' character of Ruskin's description of the plant's state of florescence quoted above (p. 336). 7 As to the time-scale of the pr ocesses brought about by Mercury and Venus respectively, experience shows that they reveal the cosmic rhythms less clearly than those for which the Moon-activity is responsible. The same is found at the opposite pole. There it is the Saturn - generated processes which show the cosmic rhythm more conspicuously than th ose engendered by Jupiter and Mars. To learn to recognize rhythmic events in nature and man as reflexions of corresponding planetary rhythms is one of the tasks which future scientific research has to tackle. A practical example of this kind will appear in the further course of this chapter. 8 See L. Kolisko: Working of the Stars in Earthly Substances, and other publications by the same author."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":" 287 9 The close connexion between the ear and the motor system of the body is shown in another way by the fact that part of the ear serves as an organ for the sense of balance. 10 The muscle-tone can be made audible by the following means. In a room guarded against noise, press the thumbs lightly upon the ears and tense the muscles of the hands and arms - say by pressure of the fingers against the palms or by contracting the muscle of the upper arms. If this is done repeatedly, the muscle-tone will be heard after some practice with increasing distinctness. It is easily distinguished from the sound of the circulating blood as it is much higher. (As an example: the author's muscular pitch, not a particularly high one, has a frequency of approx. 630 per sec., which puts it between Treble D sharp and E.) 11 Compare also the beginning of Traherne's poem Wonder, quoted in Chapter VI (p. 110), where he says that everything he saw 'did with me talk'. 12 For the particular reasons by which Goet he justifies his assertion, see his essay Leben und Verdienste des Doktor Joachim Jungius. 13 The natural question why Kepler himself did not take this step, will be answered later on."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":" 288 CHAPTER XXI Know Thyself Our inquiries have led us to a picture of man as a sensible-supersensible organism composed of three dynamic aggregates - physic al, etheric, astral. As three rungs of a spiritual ladder they point to a fourth, whic h represents that particular power in man by which he distinguishes himself from all other beings in nature. For what makes man differ from all these is that he is not only fitted, as they are, with a once-for-all given mode of spiritual-physical existence peculiar to himself, but that he is endowed with the possibility of transf orming his existence by dint of his free will - that indeed his manhood is based on this capacity for self-willed Becoming. To this fourth principle in man we can give no better name than that which every human being can apply to himself alone a nd to no other, and which no other can apply to him. This is the name, I . In truth, we describe man in his entirety only if we ascribe to him, in addition to a physical, et heric and astral body, the possession of an I (Ego). Naturally, our previous studies have a fforded many opportunities for observing the nature and mode of activity of the I. Still, at the conclu sion of these studies it is not redundant to form a concise picture of this pa rt of man's being, with particular regard to how it works within the three other pr inciples as its sheaths. For in modern psychology, not excluding the br anch of it where efforts ar e made to penetrate into deeper regions of man's being, nothing is less well understood than the true nature of man's egoity. * In order to recognize the peculi ar function of the I in man, we must first be clear as to how he differs from the other kingdoms of nature, and how they differ from one another with respect to the mode of action of the physical , etheric and astral forces. The beings of all the kingdoms of nature are endowed with an aggregate of physical forces in the form of a material body subjec t to gravity. The same cannot be said of the etheric forces. Only where life is present as an inherent principle - that is, in plant, animal and man - is ether at work in the form of an individua l etheric organization, while the mineral is formed by the universa l ether from outside. Where life prevails, we are met by the phenomena of birth and death. When a living organism comes to birth, an individual ether-body is formed out of the general etheric substance of the universe. 1 The death of such an organism consists in the separation of the etheric from the physical body and the dissolution of both in their respective mother-realms. So long as an organism is alive, its form is maintained by the ether-body present in it."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":" 289 Our studies have shown that the plant is not devoid of the operation of astral forces. In the plant's life-cycle this comes to cleare st expression in its fl orescence. But it is a working of the astral forces from outside , very much as the ether works on the mineral. As a symptom of this fact we may recall the dependence of the plant on the various outer astronomical rhythms. It is only in animal and man that we find the astral forces working in the form of separate astral bodies. This accounts for their capacity for sensation and volition. Besides the alternation of bi rth and death, they experience the rhythm of sleeping and waking. Sleep occurs when the astral body l eaves the physical and etheric bodies in order to expand into its planetary mo ther-sphere, whence it gathers new energy. During this time its action on the physical- etheric aggregate re maining upon earth is similar to that of the as tral cosmos upon the plant. Again, in the animal kingdom the ego-principle works as an external force in the form of various group-soul activities which cont rol and regulate the lif e of the different animal species. It is in th e group-ego of the species that we have to look for the source of the wisdom-filled instincts which we meet in the single animals. Only in man does the ego-principle enter as an individual entity into the single physico-etheric-astral organism. Here, howev er, the succession of stages we have outlined comes to a conclusion. For with th e appearance of the I as an individual principle, the preceding evolutionary proce ss - or, more correctl y, the involutionary process - begins to be reversed. In movi ng up from one kingdom to the next, we find always one more dynamic principle appear ing in a state of separation from its mother-sphere; this continues to the point where the I, through uniting itself with a thus emancipated physico-etheric-astral or ganism, arrives at the stage of self- consciousness. Once this stage has been reach ed, however, it falls to the I to reverse the process of isolation, temporarily sancti oned by the cosmos for the sake of man. That it is not in the nature of the I to leave its sheaths in the condition in which it finds them when entering them at the beginning of life, can be seen from the activities it performs in them during the first period after birth. Indeed, in man's early childhood we meet a number of events in which we can perceive something like ur-deeds of the I. They are the acquisition of the faculti es of walking, speaking and thinking. What we shall here say about them has, in e ssentials, already been touched upon in earlier pages. Here, however, we are putting it forward in a new light. Once again we find our attenti on directed to the threefold structure of man's physical organism. For the faculty of upright walking is a result of the I's activity in the limb- system of the body; the acquisition of speech takes place in the rhythmic system; and thinking is a faculty based on the nerve- system. Consequentl y, each of the three achievements comes to pass at a different level of consciousness-sleeping, dreaming, waking. All through the struggle of erecting the body agains t the pull of gravity, the child is entirely unaware of the activities of his own I. In the course of acquiring speech he gains a dim awareness, as though in dream, of his efforts. Some capacity of"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" 290 thinking has to unfold before the first glimme r of true self-consciousness is kindled. (Note that the word 'I' is the only one that is not added to the child's vocabulary by way of imitation. Otherwise he would, as so me mentally inhibite d children do, call all other people 'I' and himself 'you'.) This picture of the three ur-deeds of the I can now be amplified in the following way. We know that the region of the bodily limbs is that in which physical, etheric and astral forces interpenetrate most deeply. Consequently, the I ca n here press forward most powerfully into the physical body and on into the dynamic sphere to which the body is subject. Here the I is active in a wa y that is 'magic' in the highest degree. Moreover, there is no other action for which the I receives so little stimulus from outside. For, in comparison, the activity that leads to the acquisition of speech is much more of the nature of a reaction to stimuli coming from outside - the sounds reaching the child from his environment. A nd it is also with the first words of the language that the first thoughts enter the chil d's mind. Nothing of the kind happens at the first stage. On the contrary: everything that confronts the I here is of the nature of an obstacle that is to be overcome. There is no learning to speak without the hearing of uttered sounds. As these sounds approach the human being they set the astr al body in movement, as we have seen. The movements of the astral body flow towa rds the larynx, where they are seized by the I; through their help the I imbues the larynx with the facult y of producing these sounds itself. Here, therefore, the I is activ e essentially within the astral body which has received its stimulus from outside. In order to understand what impels the I to such action, we must remember the role played by speech in human life: without speech there would be no community among human individuals on earth. An illustration of what the I accomplishes as it enters upon the third stage is provided by the following episode, actually observed. Whilst all the members of a family were sitting at table taking their soup, the youngest member suddenly cried out: 'Daddy spoon ... mummy spoon. ... ' (everyone in turn spoon) ' ... all spoon!' At this moment, from merely designating single objects by na mes learnt through imitation, the child's consciousness had awakened to connective thinking. That this achievement was a cause of inner satisfaction could be heard in the joyful crescendo with which these ejaculations were made. We know that the presence of waking cons ciousness within the nerves-and-senses organism rests upon the fact that the connexion between physical body and etheric body is there the most external of all. But precisely because this is so, the etheric body is dominated very strongly by the forces to which the physical head owes its formation. This, too, is not fundamentally ne w to us. What can now be added is that, in consequence, the physical brain and the part of the etheric body belonging to it - the etheric brain - assume a function compar able with that of a mirror, the physical organ representing the reflecting mass and the etheric organ its metallic gloss. When, within the head, the etheric body reflects back the impressions received from the astral body, the I becomes aware of them in th e form of mental images (the 'ideas' of"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":" 291 the onlooker-philosopher). It is also by way of such reflexion that the I first grows aware of itself - but as nothing more than an image among images. Here, therefore, it is itself least active. If, once again, we compare the three happenings of learning to walk, to speak and to think, we find ourselves faced with the rema rkable fact that the progressive lighting up of consciousness from one stage to the next, goes hand in hand with a retrogression in the activity of the I itself. At the first stage, where the I knows least of itself, it is alive in the most direct sens e out of its own being; at the second stage, where it is in the dreaming state, it receive s the impetus of action through the astral body; at the third stage, where the I wakens to clear self-consci ousness, it assumes merely the role of onlooker at the pi ctures moving within the etheric body. Compare with this the paths to higher faculties of knowledge, Imagination and Inspiration, as we learnt to know them in our previous studies. The comparison shows that exactly the same forces come into play at the beginning of life, when the I endeavours to descend from its pre-earthly, cosmic e nvironment to its earthly existence, as have to be made use of for the ascending of the I from earthly to cosmic consciousness. Only, as is na tural, the sequence of steps is reversed. For on the upward way the first deed of the I is that which leads to a wakening in the etheric world: it is a learning to set in motion the etheric forces in the region of the head in such a way that the usual isolation of th is part of the ethe ric body is overcome. Regarded thus, the activity of the I at this stage reveals a striking similarity to the activity applied in the earl iest period of childhood at the opposite po le of the organism. To be capable of imaginative sight actually means to be able to move about in etheric space by means of th e etheric limbs of the eyes just as one moves about in physical space by means of the physical limbs. Similarly, the acquisition of Inspiration is a resuming on a higher level of the activity exercised by the I with the help of the astral body when learning to speak. And here, too, the functions are reversed. For while th e child is stimulated by the spoken sounds he hears to bring his own organ of speech into corresponding movements, and so gradually learns to produce speech, the acqui sition of Inspiration, as we have seen, depends on learning to bring the supersen sible forces of the speech-organ into movement in such a way that these fo rces become the organ for hearing the supersensible language of the universe. Our knowledge of the threefold structure of man's organism leads us to seek, besides the stages of Imagination and Inspiration, a third stage which is as much germinally present in the body's region of movement, as the two others are in the regions of thought and speech. After what we have lear nt in regard to these three, we may assume that the path leading to this thir d stage consists in pr oducing a condition of wide-awake, tranquil contemplation in the ve ry region where the I is wont to unfold its highest degree of initiative on th e lowest level of consciousness."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":" 292 In an elementary manner this attitude of soul was practised by us when, in our earlier studies, we endeavoured to become inner obs ervers of the activity of our own limbs, with the aim of discovering the origin of our concept of mass. It was in this way that a line of observation opened up to us which led to the recognition of the physical substances of the earth as congealed spir itual functions or, we may say, congealed utterances of cosmic will. Cosmic Will, however, does not work into our existence only in such a way that, in the form of old and therefore rigid Will, it puts up resistance against the young will- power of the I, so that in overcoming this resistance the I may waken to self-activity. Cosmic Will is also present in us in an ac tive form. We point here to the penetration by the higher powers of the universe into th e forming of the destiny of humanity and of individual man. And here Rudolf Steiner has shown that to a man who succeeds in becoming a completely objective observer of his own existence while actively functioning within it (as in an elementary way we endeavoured to become observers of our limb actions while engaged in perf orming them) the world begins to reveal itself as an arena of the activities of divine -spiritual Beings, whose reality and acts he is now able to apprehend through inner awar eness. Herewith a th ird stage of man's faculty of cognition is adde d to the stages of Imagin ation and Inspiration. When Rudolf Steiner chose for it the word Intuition he applied this word, also, in its truest meaning. * While through Imagination man comes to know of his ether-body as part of his make- up, and correspondingly through Inspirati on of his astral body, and thereby recognizes himself as participant in the s upersensible forces of the universe, it is through Intuition that he grows into full aw areness of his I as a spirit-being among spirit-beings - God-begotten, God-companioned, for ever God-ward striving. 1 The word 'body' is here used in a sense no different from our earlier use of it, when in connexion with our study of combustion (Chapter XI) we referred to the 'warmth-body' as a characteristic of the higher animals and man. Such a warmth-body is nothi ng else but the warmth-ether part of an ether- body. To use the word body for aggregations of etheric or astral forces is legitimate if one considers the fact that the physical body also is really a pu rely dynamic entity, that is, a certain aggregate of forces more or less self-contained."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":" 293 "},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" 294 "},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":" 295 "},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":" 296 "},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":" 297 "},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":" 298 "},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":" 299 "},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":" 300 "},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":" 301 "},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":" 302 "},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":" 303 This eBook was produced by Adam Kane. *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, MAN OR MATTER *** This file should be named elmom10h.htm or elmom10h.zip Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, elmom11h.htm VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, elmom10ah.htm Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US unless a copyright notice is included.
