Double Cubical Cross HIEROPHANT: (Holding the Cubical Cross) \"The Cubical Cross is a fitting emblem of the equilibrated and balanced forces of the elements. It is composed of twenty-two squares externally, thus referring to the twenty-two Hebrew letters which are placed thereon. Twenty-two are the letters of the Eternal Voice, in the Vault of Heaven; in the depths of the Earth; in the abyss of Water; in the all presence of Fire. Heaven cannot speak their fullness, Earth cannot utter it. Yet hath the Creator bound them in all things. He hath mingled them in Water. He hath whirled them aloff in Fire. He hath sealed them in the Air of heaven. He hath distributed them through the planets; he hath assigned unto them the twelve constellations of the zodiac. (Places Cubical Cross aside.) The thirty-second path of the Sepher Yetzirah which answereth unto the letter Tav is called the administrative intelligence and it is so called because it directeth and associateth in all their operations, the seven planets, even all of them in their own due courses. To it, therefore, is attributed the due knowledge of the seven abodes of Assiah, the material world, which are symbolized in the Apocalypse by the seven churches. It refers to the Universe as composed of the four elements; to the Kerubim; to the Qlippoth; and to the astral plane. It is the reflection of the sphere of Saturn. It represents the connecting and binding link between the material and formative world, Assiah and Yetzirah, and necessarily passes through the astral plane, the abode of the elementals and the shells of the dead. It is the rending of the veil of the Tabernacle whereon the Kerubim and the palm trees are depicted. It is the passing of the gate of Eden.\" (Leads Zelator to the West of the altar.) Universe Card"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 \"These ideas are symbolically resumed in the representation of the twenty-first Key of the Tarot before you. Within the oval formed of the seventy-two circles is a female figure, nude save for a scarf which floats around her. She is crowned with the lunar crescent of Isis, and holds in each hand a wand. Her legs form a cross. She is the bride of the Apocalypse, the Qabalistic Queen of the Canticles, the Egyptian Isis of nature now shown partly unveiled, the great feminine Kerubic angel Sandalphon on the left hand of the Mercy Seat of the Ark. The two wands are the directing forces of the positive and negative currents. The seven pointed star or heptagram alludes to the seven palaces of Assiah; the crossed legs to the symbol of the four letters of the name. The surmounting crescent receives alike the influences alike of Geburah and Gedulah. She is the synthesis of the thirty-second path uniting Malkuth with Yesod. The oval of seventy-two small circles is the Schemhamporesch, or the seventy-two fold name of Deity. The twelve larger circles form the zodiac. At the angles are the four Kerubim which are the vivified powers of the letters of the Tetragrammaton operating in the elements, through which you have just symbolically passed in the preceding ceremony. The fan, lamp, cup and salt represent the four elements themselves, whose inhabitants are the Sylphs, Salamanders, Undines and Gnomes. Be thou therefore prompt and active as the Sylphs, but avoid frivolity and caprice. Be energetic and strong like the Salamanders but avoid irritability and ferocity. Be flexible and attentive to images like the Undines, but avoid idleness and changeability. Be laborious and patient like the Gnomes but avoid grossness and avarice. So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy soul, and fit thyself to command the spirits of the elements.

The course of the Hebrew letters as placed on the paths forms, as you see, the symbol of the Serpent of Wisdom; while the natural succession of the sephiroth forms the path of the Flaming Sword, and the course of the lightning flash, as shown in the drawing. Cross and Triangle and Pillars The cross within the triangle, apex downwards, placed on the altar at the base of the Tree of Life refers to the four rivers of Paradise, while the angles of the triangle refer to the three sephiroth of Netzach, Hod, and Yesod. The two pillars right and left of the Tree are symbols of active and passive, masculine and feminine, Adam and Eve. They also allude to the pillars of Fire and Cloud which guided the Israelites in the wilderness, and the hot and moist natures are further marked by the Red Lamp and the cup of water. The pillars further represent the two Kerubim of the Ark; the right, Metatron, male; the left, Sandalphon, female. Above them ever burn the lamps of their spiritual essence, the higher life of which they are partakers in the eternal uncreated One. ( Hierophant gives Sign of Theoricus.) HIEROPHANT: \"Glory be unto thee, Lord of the land of life, for Thy splendor fills the Universe.\" Grade Sign The grade of Theoricus is referred to Yesod, as the grade of Zelator is to Malkuth. The path between them is assigned the letter Tav, whose portal you now see in the west, and through which you have just symbolically passed. To this grade certain secret signs and tokens are attributed. They consist of a sign, Grand Word, Mystic Number, and Password formed therefrom. The sign is thus given. Raise the arms level with the shoulders, bend the elbows, arms upwards, and hands bent outward, as if supporting a weight. It represents you in the path of Yesod, supporting the pillars of Mercy and Severity. It is the sign of the classical Greek god Atlas, supporting the Universe upon his shoulders, whom Hercules had to emulate. It is the Isis of Nature supporting the heavens. The Grand Word is a name of seven letters which means fast and mighty one, Shaddai El Chai. The Mystic Number is forty-five and from it is formed the Password which is Mem Heh, or Mah the secret name of the world of Formation. It should be lettered separately when given. Unto this grade and unto the sephira Yesod, the ninth path of the Sepher Yetzirah is referred. It is called the pure or clear intelligence, and it is so called because it purifieth and maketh clear the sephiroth, proveth and amendeth the forming of their representation, and disposeth their duties or harmonies, wherein they combine, without mutilation or division.

Watchtower of the East HIEROPHANT: \"The three portals facing you are the gates of the paths leading from this grade. That on the right connects with the grade of Philosophus, that on the left with the grade of Practicus, while the central one leads to the portal. This grade is especially referred to the element of Air, and therefore the great Watchtower or Terrestrial Tablet of the East forms one of its principal emblems. It is known as the first or great Eastern Quadrangle or Tablet of Air, and it is one of the four great Tablets delivered unto Enoch by the great Angel Ave. From it are drawn the three holy secret names of God ORO IBAH AOZPI which are borne upon the Banners of the East; and numberless Divine and Angelic names which appertain unto the element of Air. Kamea of the Moon To the Moon also is this grade related. Its Kamea or mystical square is formed of eighty-one squares containing the numbers from one to eighty-one arranged so as to show the same sum each way. Its ruling numbers are nine, eighty-one, three hundred sixty-nine, and three thousand three hundred twenty-one. This tablet (indicating it) shows the mystical seals and names drawn from the Kamea of the Moon. The seals are formed from lines drawn to and from certain numbers in the square. The name answering to nine is Hod, meaning glory; that answering to eighty-one is Elim, the plural of the Divine name El; that answering to three hundred sixty-nine is Chasmodai, the Spirit of the Moon. The other names are those of the intelligences and spirits of the Moon. On this tablet are shown the meanings of the lunar symbol when inscribed upon the Tree of Life. Thus, its crescent in increase represents the side of Mercy; and its crescent in decrease the side of Severity; while at full it reflects the Sun of Tiphareth.\" (Hierophant goes back to position. Hegemon conducts candidate to the west with the Hiereus .) Alchemical Sephiroth HIEREUS: \"The tablet before you shows the duplicated form of the alchemic sephiroth. In the first, the metallic root is in Kether, lead in Chokmah, tin in Binah, silver in Chesed, gold in Geburah, iron in Tiphareth. Netzach and Hod are the places of hermaphroditical brass.

Geometrical Figures to the Planets HEGEMON: \"This tablet shows you the Geometrical lineal figures attributed to the Planets. They are thus referred: The number three and the triangle to Saturn.

Be Thou eternally blessed.

( The Theoricus Ritual of the Golden Dawn , Lewellyn publications, Volume II, book II). The above is from the initiation of the Theoricus. It gives you a basic idea of the Temple layout in this ceremony. If you are a correspondence member, the Temple is laid out for you in this fashion and the ritual is performed astrally. If you are a Temple member at one of the Golden Dawn Temples, then you have the benefit of going through the initiation physically. The Theoricus grade is attributed to the sephira dwsy , just as the Zelator grade is associated with the sephira twklm . All of the center sephiroth of the Qabalistic Tree of Life are of the element of Air, except twklm , and thus the element of this grade is Air. It is also the grade of the Moon, for the Moon is attributed to dwsy . We know that Air deals with thought and it is here in the Theoricus grade that the initiate must gain control over his thoughts and his fears. This is not always an easy task because the planet of this grade is the Moon, and the Moon is the planet of fluctuation. This grade is also attributed to the four Kerubim, which are associated with the Divine name of YHVH. We know that the Kerubic forces come together in the path of t and thus the candidate must traverse the path of t , the thirty-second path of the Qabalistic Tree of Life, in his journey into dwsy . There are four officers in the Theoricus grade. All of the officers must be of 2=9 or higher. In the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the office position of Dadouchos and Stolistes may be held by a Zelator, or someone holding the grade of 1=10. Therefore, these officers are not employed in the Theoricus grade ceremony. In this grade you will notice that the Hierophant, Hegemon, Hiereus, and the Kerux are positioned in four equal parts around the Temple. The Hierophant is in the east between the Banner of the East and Banner of the West, the Hegemon in the south, the Hiereus in the west and the Kerux in the north. This is a position of balance as required when traversing the path of t . The pillars in this grade are positioned in the east. There is one other interesting piece of symbolism in this particular grade. That is that there are four officers, the four always alluding to the sephira of dsj . dsj is the first sephira of manifestation below the great Abyss of the Qabalistic Tree of Life, thus giving creation a foundation. dwsy is the sephira of foundation prior to manifestation into the Kingdom. The candidate in this initiation will quit the Temple one time during the ceremony. First the candidate will traverse the thirty-second path. After traversing the thirty- second path on the Qabalistic Tree of Life, the candidate will quit the Temple and the Temple will be rearranged. Then the candidate will be brought back into the Temple for the ceremony of his/her advancement into the grade of Theoricus.

This is exclaimed during the Theoricus grade ritual by the Hegemon. The planet that this grade refers to is the Moon, and it is the Hiereus who exclaims this during the grade ritual. The Hiereus states that it is the thirty-second path of t , the Universe, as composed of the four elements as well as the Kerubim, the Qlippoth, the astral plane and the reflection of the sphere of Saturn. The invocation of Air is important in the preparation of this ceremony, and as such the Hierophant of the Temple invokes Shaddai El Chai. In the ceremony, the Archangel of Air is also called upon, Raphael. Lastly, the energies of the Divine names that rule over the Watchtower of the East, ORO IBAH AOZPI, as well as the great King of the East, Bataivah are invoked. All of this is done under the auspices of Shaddai El Chai. The Theoricus will remember that in the Zelator grade, the Grand Word or Divine name is Adonai Ha Aretz. The mystic title is \"Periclinus de Faustis.\" The mystical number of Zelator is fifty-five. The mystic password is hn . It is here in the grade of Theoricus that the Grand Word changes to Shaddai El Chai, which means Almighty and Ever Living One. The mystic number is forty-five which is formed from the password hm , which is the secret name of the world of Formation. This overall correspondence of the grade of Theoricus falls under the sephira of dwsy . It is called \"The Pure and Clear Intelligence\", and so called because it purifies and makes clear the sephiroth. It also harmonizes all the sephiroth while removing division. In this grade the Theoricus now adds to his/her Zelator sash the symbol of Theoricus. This is the violet cross with the 2=9 symbol in a circle and a square. In addition the Theoricus adds to his or her sash a colored strip of ribbon indication that he or she is Lord or Lady of the Thirty-second Path of t . The entrance badge for the path of t in the grade of Theoricus is the Greek Cubical Cross. The Zelator, upon entering the Temple, is instructed by the Hierophant to take the Cubical Cross in his left hand and the Banner of Light, the Banner of the East, in his right hand while following his guide Anubis, who will lead him from the material into the spiritual. The elements are now portrayed and infused in a balanced manner much in the same way that they are portrayed in the path of t . You must remember that in your studies of the path of t , that t is the only path that is self balancing. So, the ritual naturally takes a direction that portrays this naturally balancing path. The Zelator, as he goes through the Theoricus ritual, is faced with these elements. First is the Hiereus who says that he is the synthesis of the elemental forces. Also, that he is a symbol of man and a symbol of life and death. This should be equated with the esoteric title of the path of t which is, \"The Great One of the Night of Time.\" But here the Hiereus states that he is the \"Child of the Night of Time\", meaning that he is the offspring of \"The Great One of the Night of Time.\" So, the aspirant on his journey throughout the Temple first meets Osiris, who bars him from passing through the gate of the eastern heavens unless he can exclaim the secret name. This is said by the Kerux who says, \"Thou art Nu, Goddess of the Firmament of Air, thou art Hormaku, Lord of the eastern Sun.\" The Hierophant then responds, \"In what signs and symbols do you come?\" The Kerux answers for the aspirant saying, \"In the letter a , in the Banner of Light, in the symbol of equated forces.\""},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22 It is very important to understand that each element is penetrated in the Theoricus grade through the equated forces of balance as exemplified through the Cubical Cross. Here the aspirant is holding fast to the Banner of Light, the banner of his higher aspirations, the synthesis of balance, if you will, and the symbol of his Higher Genius. At the same time, he is holding on to the Cubical Cross, which is also the synthesis of elemental balance. He is then saying that I can enter this way because I can balance myself and therefore I deserve to have the availability to enter this path and this element of Air. On the elemental journey, the aspirant runs into Fire, which is the priest with the mask of the Lion. Again, the Kerux exclaims the name of the lion, Mau, Lord of Fire, Ra, the Sun in his strength. Afterward, the Kerux exclaims for the candidate that he comes in the letter c , the Banner of the East, and the symbol of the Cubical Cross. Again, the penetration of Fire takes place, but through a balanced vehicle. This vehicle is the higher aspiration of the candidate and the symbol of the Cubical Cross. Now the candidate faces the priest with the mask of the eagle. This time the Hegemon responds for the candidate and says that he is, \"Heka, mistress of Hesur, ruler of Water is thy name, thou art Toum, the setting Sun.\" Here the Hegemon states for the candidate that he comes in the letter m , the banner of Light as well as the symbol of the twenty-two letters which are protrayed on the Cubical Cross. It is at this point that the candidate enters the element of Water through the balanced forces of all the elements. Finally, the candidate faces the priest with the mask of the Ox. This is the Kerubic emblem of Earth. \"Thou cannot pass the gate of the northern heaven unless thou can tell me my name,\" is proclaimed aloud as the aspirant arrives at the north. The Hegemon responds for the candidate, \"Satem, in the abode of Shu, the Bull of Earth is thy name, thou art Kephra, the Sun at night.\" The Hegemon goes on to say that he comes in the letters a , m and c and in the symbol of the Banner and the Cross. So now at this point, all three of the Mother letters have been invoked into the candidate. The candidate has been passed through with the keys to understanding this grade. So, it is through these energies that the final element of Earth is portrayed, or as could be exemplified through final h of the Tetragrammaton. This is actually a portrayal of the letter t , the four elements in balance. The Cubical Cross is a wonderful emblem to exemplify these balanced forces coming together in the letter and the path of t , which is also the Universe card of the Tarot. It is composed of twenty-two squares externally. This refers to the twenty-two letters that are placed on it. Here we see in the ceremony that the Hierophant says, \"Twenty-two are the letters of the Eternal Voice, in the Vault of Heaven, in the depths of Earth, in the abyss of Water, in the all presence of Fire. Heaven cannot speak their fullness and Earth cannot utter it.\" The path of t is called the \"Administrative Intelligence\" because it directs and associates all the operations of the seven planets in their due course. Thusly to it is attributed the knowledge of the seven abodes of Assiah, the material world, which can also be symbolized in the Apocalypse by the seven churches. In addition, the thirty-second path can also refer to the Universe as composed of four elements, to the Kerubim or the kerubic energies, to the Qlippoth, and to the astral plane as well. It is a reflection of"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"23 the sphere of Saturn and the heaven of Assiah attributed to the path of t is Saturn. It is a linked path and the way it works is that it connects the material world in the formative world of Assiah with Yetzirah. In so doing, what passes through the astral plane is the abodes of the elementals as well as the shells of the dead. In other words, it can be stated that it is the passing through the gate of Eden. The next point of consideration is the actual depiction of the Tarot card of the Universe. Some of the highlights of this path are: The seventy-two small circles referring to the Schemhamporesch or the seventy-two fold name of God. These are depicted on the card many times as little dots or stars in an oval form. The twelve large circles form the zodiac. At the four angles of the card are the Kerubim, which verifies the power of the Tetragrammaton operating through the elements on this path. This is a path of all the elements in perfect balance and harmony. They are the Sylphs, Undines, Salamanders and Gnomes. The final exortation from the Hierophant to the candidate is for him to be prompt and active as the Sylphs but avoid frivolity and caprice. This is very important, for as we learn the element of Air, we must also learn to manage the Air. Consequently, we must learn to act swiftly and without hesitation. However, we must also learn to manage in our lives the unnecessary frivolity and caprice so that we can squeeze out the most of our potential. Be energetic and strong like the Salamanders, but again, Salamanders are represented by Fire and we must avoid irritability and ferocity. Next, we must be flexible and attentive to images like the Undines but avoid idleness and changeability. The final word of caution is to be laborious and patient like the Gnomes but avoid grossness and avarice. It is at this point that the Hierophant confers the title of Lord or Lady of the Thirty- second Path upon the recipient. The Temple is rearranged and the candidate quits the Temple for a short period of time only to be brought back to the Temple for the second half of the initiation. Upon his return, the Zelator carries with him a different admission badge. He is asked upon entering, \"By what symbol do ye enter?\" The Hegemon responds for him: \"By this symbol of the Caduceus of Hermes.\" This is the entrance badge into dwsy . It is important to understand that the Tree of Life in combination with the three Mother letters are really the key to understanding and unlocking the secrets of the Caduceus of Hermes. The upper point of the Caduceus Wand rests upon rtk , the wings stretch out to hmkj and hnyb , which combine the three Supernals. The lower seven sephiroth are embraced by the serpents whose heads fall directly upon hrwbg and dsj . They are called the Twin Serpents of Egypt. They are the currents of astral light. Many mystical groups spend most of their time in idol worship of these serpents or astral light, but it is really the wings on the Caduceus that we must aspire to, for they govern the serpents. In other words, the Higher Nature must govern the lower nature. We are not Christianizing or preaching any form of morals by any means; let us make this clear. What we are saying is that we must always act with our Higher Nature and our True Will in our most profound interest. For unless we do so, we fall prey to the serpents who would swallow and devour us and consequently never attain the true freedom that the wings of the Caduceus can bring us through the light of the Supernals. In addition, the wings at the top of the Caduceus form the letter c , which is the symbol"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"24 of Fire. The heads in the upper halves of the serpents form the letter a , which is the symbol of Air. The tail which intertwines, forms the letter m , which is the symbol of Water. Thus we have the Fire of life above, the Water of creation below, and the Air symbol vibrating between them. Next we are introduced directly to the Tree of Life which is formed of the sephiroth and the connecting paths in a complete symbolism. This includes the Hebrew symbols, Divine names, the names of the Archangels and Angels. In the study of the Hebrew letters as they are placed on the paths, we see that they form the symbol of the Serpent of Wisdom. While on the other hand the natural succession of the sephiroth form the Flaming Sword of Creation, the course of the lightening flash. In addition, there is depicted the two pillars on the right and left side of the Tree symbolizing the active and passive energies, the Yin and Yang, the Male and Female. They allude to the pillars of Fire and Cloud, which is stated in the initiation itself that the pillars guided the Israelites into the wilderness. The pillars further represent the two Kerubim of the Ark of the Covenant. The one to the right is Metatron, male, and the one to the left is Sandalphon, female. The next important symbolism given is the Theoricus Grade Sign. There is a separate lesson regarding the concepts of this, so time will not be spent on it in this lesson other than to say that it represents the path of dwsy supporting the pillars of Severity and Mercy. It is the sign made by the Greek god Atlas. It is also portrayed as the Isis of Nature supporting the heavens. In addition, in the Theoricus grade we introduce the new Theoricus to the three secret names of God borne upon the Banners of the East, which are ORO IBAH AOZPI. Also introduced is the Kamea of the Moon and its mystical square. It is interesting to note that when the Moon is increasing, it is on the side of Mercy, while in its decrease it is on the side of Severity. When the Moon is full it reflects the Sun of trapt . This should be kept in mind for later serious magical workings. The Theoricus is given the mystical title Poraios de Rejectis, which means brought from among the rejected. The final adoration is very succinct and should be repeated from time to time, at least on a weekly basis by the Theoricus, as he passes through the element of Air. It is as follows: \"Spirit of Life, spirit of Wisdom whose breath giveth forth and withdraweth the form of all things. Thou before whom the life of beings is but a shadow which changeth and a vapor which passeth. Thou who mountest upon the clouds and who walkest upon the wings of the wind. Thou who breathes forth thy breath and endless space is peopled. Thou who draws in thy breath and all that cometh from thee returneth unto thee. Ceaseless motion in eternal stability, be Thou eternally blessed. We praise Thee and we bless Thee in the changeless empire of created light, of shades and reflections, and of images. We aspire without cessation unto Thy immutable and imperishable brilliance. Let the ray of Thine intelligence and warmth of Thy love penetrate even unto us. Then that which is volatile shall be fixed, the shadow shall be a body, the spirit of Air shall be a soul, the dream shall be a thought, and no more shall we be swept away by"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"25 the tempest, but we shall hold the bridles of the winged steeds of dawn. We shall direct the course of the evening breeze to fly before Thee. O Spirit of spirits. O eternal Soul of souls. O imperishable Breath of Life. O Creative Sigh.

The lower seven are embraced by the serpents whose heads rest on dsj and hrwbg . They are the Twin Serpents of Egypt, the currents of astral light. Furthermore, the wings and the top of the wand form the letter c , the symbol of Fire. The head and the upper halves of the serpents form a , the symbol of Air. Their tails enclose m , the symbol of Water. All together it forms the Fire of Life above, the Water of Creation below, and the Air symbol vibrating between them.\" (Theoricus Ritual, the Golden Dawn , Lewellyn publications, Volume II, book II). It is interesting to note that this is one of the most beautiful symbols that can be analyzed and studied. We see that the Caduceus represents both the Fire of Life and the Waters of Creation, with the reconciler between these two, the symbol of Air. It is Air that acts as a reconciling agent between Fire and Water. Remember, in all things there are always two opposing forces and a third force that reconciles them. We see that the three elements of the Mother letters are reconciled by the Caduceus. We also see that the reconciliation and unification of the Supernals is represented by the top of the Caduceus and by its wings. Again, this is a symbol that can be meditated on on a regular basis in the Theoricus grade. The badge can be painted primarily yellow with violet as a secondary color. The scales should be green. The sephiroth should be in the Queen scale of colors that were memorized in the Neophyte grade."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" THE GREEK CUBICAL CROSS

In all construction workings, everything must be built from the ground up. Moving from a more solid and stable stage, you now venture forth into the grade of Theoricus 2=9, Worker of the Air. The grade allotted to this sign is Theoricus, thus corresponding to the sephira of dwsy . This marks the third step in your advancement in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Tree of Life, the first two being that of Neophyte and Zelator. Some objectives that will be learned are those dealing with the qualities of Air. Briefly, they refer to those of thoughts, communication, and mental powers, as well as all dealings of fluidity of thought. Some of the energies that will be dealt with in this elemental grade revolve mostly around the Divine names, the Archangel, Angels, spirits and energies of the element. All these are titled under the auspices of the Divine name inscribed upon the great Watchtower of the East. The Grade Sign is formed by raising both arms up until they are level with your shoulders. Then bend both elbows upwards and extend your hands back as if holding an object on them. This sign is symbolic of being a traveler on the thirty-second path of t leading from twklm and the 1=10 grade of Zelator into the sephira of dwsy , the 2=9 grade of Theoricus. This sign also alludes to the mighty Atlas who held up the heavens upon his shoulders. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"37 Considering that the thirty-second path is a balancing path, you as a traveler become balanced yourself. The symbol that represents the forces of balance is the scales. Some forces that the scales balance are referring to karma and the pillars of balance, primarily speaking of the pillar of Severity and the pillar of Mercy. Like all other Grade Signs, the Theoricus Grade Sign is one that is especially attributed to its own particular element. The Grade Sign is attributed to Air. In displaying the sign you not only display its gesture, but you are also representing the powers and mysteries that the element of Air holds. The Grade Sign itself has quite a few uses, both practically and ceremonially. One use for the sign is for all specific workings that are done with the Tattwas. Communications done in the Tattwas by means of Grade Signs, especially as referred to the one of Vayu, help to identify the plane that you are working with. Moreover, you may find a guide to help in leading you through the plane safely. Another use concerning magical workings deals within the system of Enochian, referring to the Enochian Watchtowers, particularly the eastern quadrant. In the grade of 2=9, one particular energy that the Theoricus is almost drawn to immediately is that which is known as the great Archangel Raphael, for he is the guide and refuge of the Worker of the Air. One lesson in this grade refers to communing with the Archangel by means of the L.I.R.P.. When conversing with him through this method, it is customary to give the Theoricus Grade Sign for identification and bonding with each other. A very good way for developing a better effect with the grade sign is to apply it to your daily life. Some suggested uses are as follows. Mornings As you rise out of bed, perform your Grade Sign and say: \"May the flow of air fill my mind with light through the name of Shaddai El Chai.\" Bathing Before or during a shower, or when you take a bath, say: \"Let the Air that courses through the Water purge my soul in the name of Shaddai El Chai.\" When Retiring As you prepare to go to sleep, make the Grade Sign and say: "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"38 \"May the power of Shaddai El Chai rest upon me and keep me safe in my dreams.\" Daily use of the Grade Sign and constant affirmations throughout the day allow the subconscious mind to absorb the mystical meaning behind the gesture. Although the gesture is very simple, it is not to be taken lightly. Signs and symbols alike are types of language to the mind. So, in considering this, one goal that the student tries to strive for is the engraining of the symbols into his own mind. This is to say that it isn't just a part of the memory, but it grows as a part of your entire being.

Its Kamea or magical square is shown in the east with the seal's name appropriate thereto. It is also shown and inscribed upon the Tree of Life: Its increase in its crescent represents the side of Mercy, whereas the Moon in its decrease represents the side of Severity. In its full it represents the Sun of trapt . (The Theoricus Ritual of the Golden Dawn, Volume II, book II). It is here that you will notice the picture and the Kamea of the Moon. Notice that the numbers all add up to 3321 no matter which direction this is drawn.

This basically means that the information or esoteric tradition was handed down by word of mouth. In Chaldee, Greek, and Hebrew, there are no separate numerical symbols. Thus every word is a number and every number is a word. Mathers selected the Roman letter \"Q\" to represent the Hebrew letter q . The precedent for this particular spelling is Max Mueller's \"Sacred Book of the East.\" Mathers reminds us that Hebrew is almost an entirely consonantal alphabet. The vowels are primarily supplied by small points and lines below the letters. The Qabalah has its origins in Judaism, but is not strictly Jewish by any means. The Qabalah has captured many great minds of Christiandom as well as those of the Neo-pagan movement. Some people that have been captured by the study of the Qabalah were Ramon Lully, a celebrated scholastic metaphysician and chemist who died in 1315; John Reuchlin, a renoun scholar and reviver of oriental literature in Europe who died in 1522; John Picus De Mirandola, a famous philosopher and scholar who died in 1494. Then of course we have the famous Cornelius Agrippa, the distinguished philosopher and divine physician who died in 1535, and John the Baptist Von Helmont, a remarkable chemist and physician who died in 1644. Robert Fludd, the famous physician and philosopher who died in 1637 was also responsible for the invention of the Ouija board. Then there is Doctor Henry Moor who died in 1687. Not to mention Nostradamus, Michelangelo and countless other men and women who have achieved great stature in their personal as well as spiritual lives. Other more recent people would include S.L. MacGregor Mathers, Aleister Crowley, W. B. Yeats, Dion Fortune, and Paul Foster Case. Most of these men and women received their Qabalistic studies from the Golden Dawn system of Theosophy. Legend has it that the Qabalah was taught by God to a select company of Angels. These Angels then formed a theosophical school in Paradise. It was after the fall that the Angels most graciously communicated this heavy doctrine to the disobedient children of Earth, to furnish them with the information and knowledge so that they could return to their pristine nobility. So in other words, the first Qabalist was Adam, following him was Abraham. When Abraham moved into Egypt, the Egyptians picked up the Qabalistic doctrine as well. One thing that we must remember about the Egyptians is that they were an evolving esoteric society that constantly was changing. Their deities were evolving as their knowledge was being evolved. So in a lot of Egyptian mysticism, we do see the influences of Qabalistic doctrine. Moses himself was initiated into the doctrine of the Qabalah in his birth land of Egypt. However, he actually received his knowledge of the Qabalah from Angels. A lot of this is a mythological way of expressing how the oral tradition was passed down from one generation to the other. Perhaps we would be best to say that our first early Qabalists were David and Solomon. They in fact were initiated into the Qabalah. No one ever dared to write down the Qabalah, at that time, until Schimeon Ben Jochai. This information then was passed on to his son Rabbi Eleazar and his secretary Rabbi Abba as well as their disciples. All of these teachings composed the celebrated work called Zohar (Zhr), which means \"The Book of Splendor.\" This is probably the largest storehouse of Qabalistic doctrine and material. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"62 The Qabalah is classified under four headings: 1. The Practical Qabalah 2. The Literal Qabalah 3. The Unwritten Qabalah 4. The Dogmatic Qabalah The Practical Qabalah deals with talismanic and ceremonial magic. The whole of the Golden Dawn system is in fact an elucidation of this topic. Next, we have the literal Qabalah and it refers primarily to the study of GMTRIA, in English gematria, and the study of notarikon (NVTRIQVN), and lastly THMVRH which is pronounced Temurah. Gematria works on the numerical value of words. Words of similar numerical value are considered to be explanatory of each other. This theory is extended to phrases as well. Thus the letter c is equal to 300 and may be likened to the word Ruach Elohim (RVCH ALHIM), which means the Spirit of the Elohim. So consequently these two words have the same numerical value of 300. Therefore they are likened to be similar to each other. The numerical value is R=200, V=6, CH=8, A=1, L=30, H=5, I=10, M=40 which then gives the total of 300. Another example of this is the word Metatron (MTTRVN), and the name of deity Shaddai (SHDI). Each equals the number 314, so that one is really being taken symbolically of the other. Notarikon is derived from the Latin word \"Notarius,\" meaning a shorthand writer. There are two forms of Notarikon. In the first method every letter or word is taken for the initial or the abbreviation of another word. An example is AGLA which is used in the L.B.R.P.. It is a notarikon which stands for \"Atah Gibor Liholam Adonai.\" Translated, this means, \"Thou art Great Forever my Lord.\" The second form of Notarikon is the exact opposite. In this method, the last letter is used to form a word. Temurah is permutation, where a letter is substituted for another letter. Thus from one word a totally different word may be formed. The alphabet is bent exactly in half. One half is put over the other, and by changing alternately the first or first two letters at the beginning of the second line, twenty-two commutations are produced. These are simply called the Table of Combinations. 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 K I T Ch Z V H D G B A M N S O P Tz Q R Sh Th L This first method is called Albath (Albth) and it is the most common and prevalent method of Temurah. There are twenty-one other methods of Temurah. For the serious student who would apply some time and effort into this, some time should be spent in reading various selected Qabalistic writings on this, even MacGregor Mathers \"Intro to the Qabalah\" would suffice. It is not the intention of this lesson to go into in-depth study of these twenty-one various methods. In addition it is not necessary at this time to expose the extended version of this lesson. There is however one important method called, \"The Qabalah of Nine Chambers\", or Aiq Bekar (AIQ BKR). "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"63 300 30 3 200 20 2 100 10 1 SH L G R K B Q I A 600 60 6 500 50 5 400 40 4 M (f) S V K (f) N H Th M D 900 90 9 800 80 8 700 70 7 Tz (f) Tz T P (f) P Ch N (f) O Z You will notice the affinity between the letters in each chamber. According to Mathers: \"Sometimes this is used as a cipher by taking the portions of the figure to show the letters they contain, putting one point for the first letter and two for the second etc.. Thus the right angle containing AIQ, will answer to the letter Q if it has three points within it. Again a square will answer for H, N, or K (final), according to whether it has 1, 2 or 3 points consecutively within it. So also with regards to the other letters, but there are other ways of employing the Qabalah with the Nine Chambers.\" Mathers then points out an example of Temurah called ATHBASH (ATHBSH). It is found in Jerimiah XXV. 26. The word Sh, Shk, Sheshakh, symbolizes , Babel (BBL). It is not critical or important for testing for you to have mastered the Qabalah of the Nine Chambers or ATHBSH or any other methods, however this is a study that you may wish to pursue on your own. You should be able to find several Qabalistic doctrines such as the Zohar , Sepher Yetzirah and the Bahir and traditional kosher books on the Qabalah that will give you some concept of how to work with the subject of Temurah. Again, for testing it is merely important that you understand that it is part of the Literal Qabalah. The next type of Qabalah is the Unwritten Qabalah. This is the Qabalah that is never entrusted to writing but is communicated orally. This Qabalah is not allowed to be written down though most of it has been in recent years. Part of the unwritten Qabalah in addition is really an elucidation of what we now call the \"Internal Qabalah.\" The theory holding here is that approximately seventy percent of the Qabalah must be learned internally, not externally through the use of books. The final type of the Qabalah is the Dogmatic Qabalah. Within this doctrine is contained the doctrinal portion of the Qabalah. The basic four are the Sepher Yetzirah , the Zohar , the Sepher Sephira , and the Asch Metzareph . The Sepher Yetzirah is known as the Book of Formation and is ascribed to the patriarch Abraham. It is basically a commentary on the ten numbers and the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, otherwise called the thirty-two paths. The Zohar or Splendor is another large voluminous book with a tremendous amount of information within it. It is probably the most quoted of Qabalistic books. The Asch Metzareph or Purifying Fire is the Hermetic and Alchemical Fire. The Qabalah is designed to solve the following questions: The Supreme Being, his nature and attributes. Cosmogony. The creation of Angels and man."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"64 The destiny of man and Angels. The nature of the soul. The nature of Angels, demons and elementals. The import of revealed law. The transcendental symbolism of numerals. The peculiar mysteries contained within the Hebrew letters. The equilibrium of commentaries. There is a significant amount of other information covered in MacGregor Mathers The Qabalah Unveiled . We also highly suggest you purchase this book as additional reading. As one of the co-founders of the Golden Dawn, his writings at times reach deeper and explain more than most other commentators. However, at times it can be a little dry. Nonetheless it is still worth the time it takes to read the information.

When we talk about the sephiroth and the paths, we are talking about energy planes or states of consciousness. Now we are going to try to talk about what is beyond the Tree of Life. If you look at most glyphs of the Tree of Life, you will notice that there are three rings above rtk . These three rings are known as the three veils of negative existence. These veils are known as Ain, Ain Soph, and Ain Soph Aur, consecutively. We are going to set a premise of understanding before we delve further into this lesson. The premise being stressed is that all the names of God, from whatever culture they may come, Hebrew, Arabic, Egyptian or Christian, all tend to deal with God in manifestation. They deal with the Creator after he has manifested. In many cases, they deal with the Creator in the state of polarity and duality as found in the sephiroth. There is no name for God beyond creation. God is without name. The best way to state this concept is that we can never know the true name of God as long as we are an aspect of creation. It is only through the elevation of our consciousness beyond our own limits that we can come to know the unspeakable name of God. It is probably the most significant reason why we find that in Hebrew, God's name is unspeakable. Speech, words and letters are aspects of creation, and thus they are aspects of consciousness. The three veils of negative existence, however, particularly Ain and Ain Soph, are beyond consciousness, beyond words and symbols, and beyond creation. Some might bring up the creation according to Genesis in the Bible and say that the name of Elohim is used thirty-two times in the opening of Genisis. However, it must be kept in mind and emphasized that none of the names of God refer to the Creator himself. The Creator himself is referred to one of the veils of negative existence, particularly Ain Soph. This basically means \"Infinite Being\" or \"The Infinite.\" The names used in the scriptures refer to various ways in which God manifested himself in creation. Thus, the name Elohim that is found in Genesis, refers to the manifestation of dilineation and definition and not to the Infinite Being. The Universe is nothing more than thought projected from the mind of Deity. Thought does have form, however, for it can be measured and is considered to have substance. Consequently, we can also consider thought as a basis of creation. Again, we are not absolutely accurate because we are at a place that doesn't exceed the limits of the veils of negative existence, which are essentially even beyond thought. Let us consider for a moment that the Universe is the consciousness by-product of the mental activity of the Infinite Unknowable Deity. If this be the case, then the Tree of Life is the symbolic representation of the raw material of the Divine Consciousness. It is also indicating the process whereby the Universe came into full manifestation and being. As stated earlier in this lesson, the three veils of negative existence really stretch and cross some imaginary line beyond thought and beyond consciousness in the sense of how we understand the term. Even thought itself and consciousness can be said to be manifestation in some form or another, aside from that of the three veils of negative existence which are beyond the World of Manifestation. The Qabalist draws a veil at the point of manifestation between rtk and the three veils of negative existence. We draw this veil not because there is nothing there, but simply because the mind as such must stop there. It cannot comprehend beyond"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"67 that point. It is interesting to note that no matter how far we take our minds back to the origins of existence, we find that there is always a preceding existence. The mind can only go back so far. It only has the ability to reach back into history, time or space, or to a finite point if you will. We find that on the other hand, the three veils are infinite and, thus, the mind cannot comprehend them. We, as Qabalists, attempt to allow our minds to go back as far as the highest point, the farthest backpoint that we can manage. This is rtk and it is equated with the most transcedent form of God that we can conceive with a physical mind. The God name of rtk is \"Eheieh.\" This translated is \"I Am\", or more understandably, \"The Self Existing One\" or \"Pure Being.\" This, in its totality, does not mean very much to us unless we have a deeper understanding of its concept. Consequently, we need hmkj (Wisdom) and hnyb (Understanding) to have a better comprehension of rtk . The sephiroth become better known to us as we relate them to the other sephiroth on the Tree of Life. Moreover, we do not have this option when we reach this veil of negative existence simply because the veils have nothing to compare themselves to. All forms of science, philosophy and religion reach this point, the veil of negative existence. Scientists even go back to the Big Bang theory. However, due to this veil, it limits such passage to moving any further. The same is true with many religions. They find themselves picturing deity as a man with a white beard on a throne, certainly this is not accurate. It is only the occultist that attempts to go beyond the veils of negative existence. This may sound impossible, yet we are able to penetrate deeper into the creation of existence, of all that is and all that is not, because we use symbols and deep meditative methods for understanding the creation of the Universe. S.L. MacGregor Mathers says that rtk is the twklm of the unmanifest. \"The Limitless Ocean of Negative Light does not proceed from a center, for it is centerless yet it concentrates a center which is the number one of the manifested sephira of rtk .\" Thus, we see that the limitless gives rise and manifestation to the infinite center and oneness which becomes the crown, rtk . We, as occultists and Qabalists, recognize four planes of manifestation and three planes of unmanifestation or negative existence. These are called Ain, meaning negativity or no-thing; Ain Soph, meaning without limit; and Ain Soph Aur, meaning limitless Light. It is out of Ain Soph Aur that we have the Primordial One manifested as depicted in rtk . (For those of you who have forgotten the four planes of manifestation, they are as follows in order: Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah and Assiah.) In regard to negative existence, if we think in terms of anything that we already know or could possibly know, we shall be in error. For whatever else there may be, negative existence simply cannot be and, moreover, it is unmanifested. The three veils of negative existence suggest certain concepts or ideas to our minds. Keep in mind now that everything in this lesson may not be purely accurate. In regards to Ain (again, meaning no-thing, and it is spelled rightly so), this particular veil is not the same as the concept of nothingness, but rather it is negativity. In addition, this is not to be related to the negativity of Darkness. Our minds cannot conceive of such a thing that is and is not. We cannot conceive of the concept of existence and non- existence as being one and the same."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"68 Negative existence is really outside the realization of our ability to understand it. However, this does not mean to say that we are outside of the range of its influence on us. On the physical plane we have no direct access to the Being of negative existence, yet all that we know as existing has its roots and origins in this negative existence. What we are trying to say here basically is that although we don't truly know of negative existence, we certainly know of its effects on our own existence and lives. The Mystics throughout history who have ventured as far back as one can safely go on this physcial existence have referred to negative existence as Light or Ain Soph Aur, the \"The Boundless and Limitless Light.\" They have spoken of the first manifestion as sound; \"In the Beginning was the Word.\" Thus, in conclusion, we wish to emphasize that behind the most exalted aspects of our Universe lies the Unmanifest, which is the \"Ultimate Source of All\", \"The Great Unknowable One\" which cannot be known to us. The unmanifest is symbolized by the words negative limitless Light, or in Hebrew, Ain Soph Aur. On the glyph of the Tree of Life, you will notice that there are three curves of radiating Light. The outer curve is Ain (No-thing), the middle or center is Ain Soph, and the innermost is Ain Soph Aur. These are basically understood to be the veils that separate the outpouring of our Universe from that which it emerged. Behind these mystical veils energy flows constantly to us from rtk , moving down the Tree through hmkj , hnyb etc., following the path of the Flaming Sword until it reaches its base in twklm . Most of our study in the area of esoteric thinking and magical workings deals with the manifested Universe through the Tree of Life and the paths that connect them. Very little is done with the concept of negative existence because of the fact that it is beyond comprehension. Let us re- emphasize that negative existence does have an effect on our lives as it is the source of all that is and all that is not. r t k [ w s } w a } w a r w a [ w s } w a "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"69 Tzim Tzum One of the important concepts of the Qabalah is that of Tzim Tzum, or self constriction of God's Light. The process of Tzim Tzum is confusing to Qabalistic as well as Theosophic scholars. So, consequently, it is not important that you totally understand it, but it is essential that you do have some basic knowledge of it. It was Rabbi Issac Luria, 1534 - 1572, the head of one of the finest Qabalistic schools, who probably gave us our clearest statement on the subject of Tzim Tzum. Here is what he had to say: \"Before all things were created... The Supernal Light was simple, and it filled all existence. There was no empty space... when His simple will was to create all universes... He constricted the Light to the sides... leaving a vacated space... This space was perfectly round... After this constriction took place... There was a place where all things could be created... He then drew a single straight thread from the Infinite Light... and brought it into the vacated space... It was through that line that the Infinite Light was brought down below...\" So, we see the process of Tzim Tzum as being rather straightforward. God first withdrew His Light, forming a vacated space in which all creation would take place. In order for His infinite creative power to be in that space, He projected into that space a thread of His Light. Essentially, it was through this thread of Light that all creation took place. Let us emphasize here that Tzim Tzum is not to be taken literally since it is impossible as human beings to apply any spatial concept to God. We are speaking of Tzim Tzum in a conceptual sense. If God filled every space of perfection, then man would have no reason to exist. In other words, God constricted Himself (His infinite perfection), allowing a place for man's free will and accomplishment to exist. Let us also emphasize that Tzim Tzum did not take place in God's essence, but rather in His Light. It was this Light that was the first thing that was brought into being, representing God's power of creation. This itself, the Light, had been brought into existence for the purpose of creating the Universe. We find that one of the first teachings of the concept of Tzim Tzum was really made available to us from the Zohar. A passage may be referred to as thus, \"At the head of the king's authority, He carved out the Supernal Luminescence, a Lamp of Darkness. There emerged out of the hidden of hidden, the mystery of the infinite, an unformed line, embedded in a ring... measured with a thread... \" Without a doubt, this is a direct reference to the process of Tzim Tzum. If we examine the reasons behind Tzim Tzum, they stem from a basic philosophical paradox. God must be in the world, therefore, all things must be God and of God. Yet, if He does not restrict Himself from it, all creation would be overwhelmed by His essence, since His essence is infinite. This also creates another difficult paradox involving Tzim Tzum. Since God removed His Light from the vacated space, it must be empty of his essence. Still, all in all, God must also fill this space since \"There is no place empty of"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"70 Him.\" This is the most profound and basic paradox, and it closely relates to God's transcendence and eminence. This paradox brings out a very strong point that we must realize, and that is, this space is only Dark and vacated with respect to us as human beings. This \"Lamp of Darkness\" mentioned in the Zohar is \"Darkness\" to us. In relation to the Great Unknowable Lord of the Universe, it too is a \"Lamp.\" In other words, with respect to God, it is actually Light. For God it is as if Tzim Tzum never took place. The process of Tzim Tzum was not for God, but rather it was required for us. It is through the study of the Qabalah that in the Mysteries we try to understand and solve the paradox of how an absolutely transcending God could interact with his creation. It is the understanding of the sephiroth and similar concepts that helps us to bridge between the Great Unknowable One and the Universe, as well as ourselves. Perhaps they are one and the same, yet certainly the Great Unknowable King of the Universe is more than His own creation. Let us also remember that the Darkness or vacated space created by Tzim Tzum is actually Light with respect to God. The creation of the vacated space through the process of Tzim Tzum as well as to all the worlds known and unknown, does in no way change or diminish God's Infinite Light of Ain Soph Aur. In simplistic terms, we have the concept of no-thing, otherwise known as \"Ain\" or negative existence. This then became the boundless, the feminine aspect, the Infinite known as \"Ain Soph.\" Together they create \"Ain Soph Aur,\" the Infinite Light. The Light then restricted itself through the process of Tzim Tzum, yet it was only restricted as far as our perceptions are concerned. This in itself gives rise to rtk .

In higher grades, you may or may not decide to work with these figures, but if you work at all in the area of talismanic work, you will be using polygons and polygrams. The point within the circle, the Primordial Point, is a representation of rtk . Really not much can be said about this Primordial Point, for in it is the potential of all things and of no thing. All things emanate from the Primordial Point. All things end at the Primordial Point. The cross within the circle is attributed to hmkj . Here we have the Root of Wisdom according to the Sepher Yetzirah . So the cross within the circle is a representation of all things and no thing in perfect harmony and balance as well as unity. hnyb is represented by the triangle inside the circle. The triangle is the only lineal figure in which all the surfaces can be reduced. What we are saying here is that every polygon can be divided into triangles by simply drawing lines from its angles to its center. The triangle is the simplest of all lineal figures, therefore it is the first of all lineal figures. In the Neophyte Initiation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, we state that in all things there are two opposing forces and a third force uniting them. This would refer to the triad which operates in all things, especially the Supernals. It would also refer to hnyb , the third sephira. We see clearly that hnyb is an amalgamation of the top three Supernals. This is emphasized in the lesson, \"Understanding of the Human Personality in the World of the Qabalah.\" The top three sephiroth are referred to as the Greater Neschamah, whereas hnyb is referred to as the Lesser Neschamah. The triangle would also refer to the planet of Saturn and to the element of Fire. The color of Saturn is black and that of Fire is red. Therefore, the black triangle would represent Saturn and a red triangle would represent the element of Fire. Note also that a White Triangle represents the Supernals. We also have another triad, the three principles of nature: Salt, Mercury, and Sulfur. All of these symbols can be exemplified in the triangle which would give reference to hnyb . The square is another lineal figure that is generally understood to represent equation and stability. Within the symbol of the square is included the idea of surface and superficial measurement. The square refers to the quaternary of all things and to the tetrad of the holy name YHVH which operates through the four elements. The square is attributed to dsj , the fourth sephira. It would equally correspond to the planet Jupiter. It is also a fitting representative of the four elements that will eventually take on manifestation. The next figure is the pentangle. This refers to the sephira of hrwbg and the planet Mars. The pentangle can be traced in two different ways. When it is reflected from every second point it is called the pentagon, which is referred to hrwbg and Mars. The same figure, when reflected from every third point, is called the pentagram. The pentagon is a fitting symbol that naturally represents the power and essence of the pentad. This operates through nature by the dispersal of the spirit and the four elements through it. The pentagram is called the Signet Star of the Microcosm. It is a good and holy symbol, it is a positive symbol that represents man with his arms and legs extended,"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 73 adoring the Lord of the Universe. It also represents the domination of the Higher Will of the Spirit ruling over the elements. Another way of putting this is mind over matter. When the pentagram has a single point pointing downward it is then known to be a negative or evil symbol. It becomes representative of a goat's head or a demon's head. This is a representation of the abasement of reason, the lack of reason, and the loss of reason beneath the blind force of matter. Notice that we didn't say beneath the blind force of Spirit. It is beneath the blind force of gross matter. The inverted pentagram is also a representation of the elevation or adoration of anarchy above order. It is also the elevation of conflicting forces driven simply by chance or haphazardness above the elevation of the Divine Unknowable One. The upright pentagram represents the force of spirit and the four elements governed by the five letters of the name of the Restorer of all things. The element of spirit the letter c is fused between the masculine and the feminine, forming the Pentagrammaton out of the Tetragrammaton. With a circle drawn around the pentagram it represents the Kerubim and the Wheel of Spirit. One final point of symbolism of the pentagram is that it becomes a tremendous force for the letter h , the feminine aspect, the letter of the great Supernal mother, Aima Elohim. If we reflect from every second point of the symbol of the hexangle, it would then be titled a hexagon. When it is reflected from every third point, it then takes on the form of the hexagram. This symbol, the hexagram, directly refers to the sephira trapt . The hexangle is a fitting representative for the powers of the hexad which operates through Nature. The hexad does this by the dispersal of rays of the various planets and the zodiacal emanations penetrating through the Sun. Those who wish to pursue will understand that a sextile is both powerful and good. If we take the number of degrees of the great circle and cut it off at sixty degree angles, we form this astrological sextile aspect. It is not quite as related to the Sun nature as is the hexagram. It should be remembered that the suffix \"-gon\" really relates to the dispersion of energy, the distribution of energy, and a radiation of force. When a hexagram is used as the diagram it represents concentrated force. Both are applicable, the hexagon would be for spreading of energies and the hexagram would be for specific or concentration of energies, as well as the sealing of energies. You should remember that at times in magical workings both of them may be employed, but the hexagon always initiates the whirl. We call the hexagram the Signet Star of the Macrocosm. It is the sign of the Macrocosm, the greater or outer world. The six angles easily represent the six-day period of creation as depicted in Genesis, while its synthesis can be akin to the seventh day, a period of rest. This is summed up by its hexagonal center. Let us divert a moment to the subject of the Unicursal Hexagram. For years it was thought and proported by followers of Aleister Crowley that he had invented this particular hexagram. After studies of early Order Documents, it was determined that the Unicursal Hexagram was used by S.L. MacGregor Mathers and was invented by the mathmatician Pascal. For specific Enochian workings, a hexagram that could be drawn in one single line was needed. There are some specific workings where John Dee and Kelly were commanded by angelic forces to use a hexagram that was not drawn in two strokes of the pen or wand, but by a single stroke. This, however, was not widely employed by our founders, but used for those specific Enochian workings."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 74 The Unicursal Hexagram employs or denotes the rulership of presidency of the Sun and Moon over the four elements. All of these are united in spirit as they come together. There is some information about the Unicursal Hexagram in various books which will be covered in higher grades for those of you who would wish to pursue this hexagram and its workings. In regards to the traditional hexagram, often times called the Hebrew or Jewish star, it represents the force of the planets acting through the various signs of the zodiac. This is very powerful and effective in sealing the astral image of Nature under the presidency of the sephiroth, as well as the seven palaces. The hexagram is especially attributed to the Sun. This symbol is one of great power, a symbol of great strength. In it are both the combination of the pentagram and the cross, thus forming a very potent and positive triad which are in harmony with each other. The heptangle refers to the seventh sephira of jxn . As we disperse the power of the seven planets through the week and the year, we have the creation of the heptagon. It also alludes to the seven colors of the rainbow. The heptagram is the star of Venus and is applicable to her nature. The lineal figure of the seven planets is the heptagram representative of Venus' gates or entrances. It is also a fitting symbol of the Isis of Nature, as well as the seven lower sephiroth of the Bride. This is a powerful symbol when Venus or jxn energy needs to be employed. It is extremely effective in the use of talismans for those who are overly intellectual in their thinking. It becomes a fitting symbol for concentration and meditation for those who are overly influenced by Mercury. The eighth sephira of dwh is represented by the octangle. The power of the ogdoad and the octagon are naturally represented in the octangle. It is this symbol that naturally shows the dispersal of the rays of the elements in their dual aspects. Remember that there is a dual aspect to everything under the leadership and presidency of the eight letters of the name. The octagram, when it is reflected from each third point, yields eight triangles. These eight triangles become representative of the triad operating within each element in its dual form. Thus, we have the positive and the negative under the power of the third aspect of the triad which becomes YHVH Adonai, but is written as if it is bound together as IAHDONHI. If we take the Octagram and reflect it from every fourth point, we have the star of Mercury, and this certainly is akin to the nature of Mercury. It is a further potent symbol representing the binding together of concentrated positive and negative forces of nature and of the elements, under the name of IAHDONHI (Remember that it is a combination of the Tetragrammaton and Adonai together). We must always remember that Adonai is the key of YHVH. The Enneangle is referred to the ninth sephira of dwsy . It is representative of the power of the ennead and the enneagon. It also shows the operating power of nature by the dispersal of the rays of the seven planets and of the Head and Tail of the Dragon of the Moon, otherwise known as Cauda and Caput Draconis. When we reflect on the enneagram from every third point, we find that we arrive at the triple ternary operating both in the seven planets with the Cauda and Caput Draconis of the Moon and also with the alchemical principles counterchanged and interwoven. It is not akin much to the nature of Luna as it is to the sphere of dwsy . It is only when the enneagram is reflected from every fifth point that it becomes consonant"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 75 with the nature of Luna. The Enneagram is the star of the Moon, the star of Luna. It is a fitting representation of the Moon's administration to the Earth through the virtues of the solar system under the presidency of the sephiroth. When the enneagram is reflected from every fourth point, it is composed of the three triangles united with a circle which alludes to the triple ternary of the three alchemical principles, sulfur, mercury and salt. When reflected from every fourth point, it is not so much in harmony with the nature of Luna as when the enneagram is reflected from the fifth point. The dekangle represents the power of the dekad and the dekagon. The dekagon shows the power of the dekad operating in nature by the dispersal of the rays of the ten sephiroth. The number of degrees of the great circle cut off between its angles is thirty-six. The dekagram reflected from every third point is especially in harmony with twklm . This shows the triad operating through the angle of two pentagons with a circle. It also alludes to the three alchemical principles, plus spirit, plus the four elements in their positive and negative form all under the presidency of the ten sephiroth. The dekagram, reflected from the fifth point, is composed of two pentagrams within a circle. It alludes to the operation of the duplicated h of the Tetragrammaton, as you know there is a first and final h . It also refers to the concentration of positive and negative forces of Spirit and of the four elements under the presidency of hnyb , the convolution and revolution of forces under Aimah. As a general rule, the endekagram refers to the Qlippoth. When it is reflected from every forth point, it represents their restriction. However, from other reflections, it indicates the Qlippoth's operation through nature. Thus, we can say that the endekangle naturally represents the evil and imperfect nature of the endekad and the endekagon. This is highlighted by the dispersal of the eleven curses of Mount Ebal through the Universe. The dodekangle refers to the aspect that we call the zodiac. It represents the power of the dodekad. The dodekagon represents the influences of the zodiac through Nature. However, the dodekagram represents its constriction. The number of degrees of the great circle cut off between its angles is thirty. This forms a weak astrological semi-sextile. One final note is that when using these lineal figures later in the forming of talismans under the directions of the sephiroth, we must remember that all of the sephiroth below the point of hmkj should have a double, triple, or quadruple form of their lineal figures bound together in their talismans. For example, let's take the heptangle of jxn , the heptagon and the two forms of the heptagram. They should all be united in the same talisman with the extremities of the angles coinciding. Later, in the higher grades and in talismanic work, you will be utilizing these figures for potent and powerful planetary, zodiacal, and sephirotic work. It is not necessary in this grade to have every aspect of every figure memorized, but you should have a working knowledge of each figure and how it applies to every sephiroth and every planet. This will give you a basic understanding and allow the information to seep into your mind and thus be easily utilized later for potent, powerful workings.

Also, we will see how they relate from a magical standpoint which will later be used in the rite of invocation. This is vital information for anyone who wishes to do evocative magic. In addition, the understanding of astrology and other important aspects of the Golden Dawn system are equally important to the understanding of such aspects. In the Zelator grade, some time was spent in the study of the names of the planets in Hebrew as well as their ruling angel, spirit and intelligence. One point that needs to be emphasized in this lesson is that the planets are not the sephiroth. The sephiroth are much larger in scope and dimension whereas the planets are considered the \"Heavens of Assiah.\" If you recall, in the lesson of the Four Worlds, we have the Divine name of God in Atziluth, the Archangelic name in Briah, the Choir of Angels in Yetzirah and in Assiah we have the planets, the \"Heavens of Assiah.\" ARATHOR BETHOR PHALEGH OCH HAGITH OPHIEL PHUL Warning!

In the English and Roman cultures, Saturn is referred to as the god that gives birth to her children and then consumes them afterwards. In Greek, Saturn is referred to as \"Chronos\", otherwise known as \"Father Time.\" In Hebrew we refer to Saturn as the Sphere of Shabbathai. The Olympic Planetary Spirit is Arathor. The basic description of Saturn is that of loftiness, sometimes considered as mourning or brooding, the force of constriction and crystallization. Saturn has a strong affinity with the land of the depths of the Earth, the advancing of age, and with the long passage of time. It also has an affect on our artistic creativity and the bringing of ideas into material form. Saturn can be a very positive or negative planet depending on how it is used. It deals magically with invisibility. It also deals with karma. Saturn is attributed to the sphere of hnyb . Saturn is often times referred to as, \"The Parent of Faith,\" because from it, in its essential nature, faith does proceed. It has an elemental affinity with Earth. The planetary figure is the triangle. Saturn affects the physiological functions in the following ways. It governs the skin, all bones, teeth, the structure and the cartilages. It also governs the spleen, the glands, and the knees in particular. Skin afflictions such as leprosy, eczema and scurvy"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"84 can be the negative result of Saturn. Restricted afflictions such as impeded circulation and rheumatism, as well as atrophies and maladies can come under Saturn's influence. One of the deities attributed to Saturn is Nephthys, the sister of Isis, \"The Mysterious One, Self Born\", \"The Self Existent One\", \"The Everlasting Goddess and Concealed One\", \"The Mistress of the Spindle and the Loom\", \"Lady of Heaven and of the West\", \"Lady of Sais.\" Her magical image or god form is the one who wears the red crown. She may also be adorned with the old kingdom headdress surmounted by the symbol of the shuttle. She carries with her the two crossed arrows and the bow. She also bears with her the Ankh accompanied sometimes with the Papyrus or the Ouas, \"The Scepter of Peaceful Authority\". One other Egyptian god form associated with Saturn is Ptah. He is \"The Celestial Artificer\", \"The First Father\", \"The Primal Power of the Beginnings\", \"The Fashioner of the Firmament and Pattern of the Sun and Moon\", \"The Architect of all that is.\" Ptah's image is seated upon his throne, but at times he may be standing. He is the god that wears the ceremonial beard which is usually very long and pointed. He normally wears a circling band around his bald head. His body is tightly wrapped, signifying his character as a spirit who moves within \"The Wrappings of Form of Creations.\" Creation comes from the sphere of hnyb . Saturn is in fact part and parcel in hnyb . Ptah bears the Ankh accompanied with the Tut symbol. He is known as \"The Lord of Stability.\" Another Egyptian god form referred to Saturn is that of Harpocrates, the child Horus. This aspect is included in later workings dealing with Invisibility. This particular god form is the \"Sign of Silence.\" Saturn is enshrouded in mystery, Darkness, and silence. Also ascribed to Saturn is the goddess Isis, known as \"The Mourning One\", \"The Maternal Mother who gives birth to the world and all creation through restriction.\" She fits better with the sphere of hnyb than that of Saturn, although she at times has been attributed to the Saturn/ hnyb combination. From an astrological point of view, the aspects of Saturn, as well as the house it rules, indicates how a person expresses the capacity for self discipline and where and how they build structure in their life. Without a well-developed influence of Saturn, an individual cannot go far in life because the discipline and experiences that are necessary to acquire are lacking in an afflicted Saturn. Saturn is also a very karmic planet. Its aspects in regards to other planets show how a person is to fulfill himself or to correct mistakes of the past, thus acquiring valuable experience in doing so and redeeming the deficiencies of one's nature. A person with a heavily afflicted Saturn can be selfish and rigid in their attitudes. Also, it can cause problems in social interactions which can lead to a lot of misfortunes and personal limitations. People who have a strong influence of Saturn in their natal chart are ambitious in nature. The Great Work becomes very important to this person. One final note on the planet of Saturn. According to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn system of magic, it is used for all general magical workings. The reason for this is that the planet Saturn is known as a general working planet. Being in hnyb contributes to the fact that it is a general working planet in the pursuit of developing better relationships and understanding between the person and the planet.

It is conducive to prosperity, abundance, and health as well as advancement. It is benevolent energy. The sephira that Jupiter is ascribed to is Gedulah or dsj , meaning love.

A drawing of the sigil Bethor is included at the end of this lesson. The Divine names as ascribed to the sephira of dsj are El in Atziluth, Tzadqiel in Briah, Chasmalim in Yetzirah, and finally Tzedek as the Heavens of Assiah. The planetary angel is Sachiel. One of the deities in the Egyptian Pantheon is Hapi of the North, \"The Vast One\", \"The Unsearchable Lord of the Celestial Rivers\", \"Father of the Gods\", \"He Who Makes to Live\", \"Sustainer of Life\", \"Creator of Blessings\", \"Nourisher\", \"Giver of Peace\", \"The Father of Increase and of Abundance\", \"The Lord of the Papyrus\", \"The Lord of the Lotus\", \"The Fountain of Divine Power.\" His image includes a headdress that he wears which compliments a collar and a girdle. His form is male with pendant breasts. In his hand he bears the lotus and the papyrus as \"Lord of the Two Niles\", and may appear in double images. Moving on toward the other direction, Hapi of the South is adorned in white and is crowned with the lotus. As Hapi of the North, his adornments are red and he is crowned with papyrus. The next Egyptian god ascribed to Jupiter is Maat, \"That which is true\", \"The Perfect Measure\", \"Maat the Beautiful, of Law, Justice and Truth\", \"The Good Gift\", \"Sustainer of the Sun, Tracer of the Course of the Sun\", \"The Changeless and Consort\", \"Queen of the Earth\", \"Directoress of the Underworld\", \"The Right Order.\" Her image portrays her as dignified and stately. The goddess at times may appear to be winged. She bears the Ankh and Papyrus Scepter and upon her old kingdom headdress is bound a single feather of truth that is used to judge those that are brought to her by the god Anubis. This feather is used in the judgement of the heart where it is weighed against an individual's heart. Overseeing the entire tribunal is the god Thoth. Maat is also ascribed to the office of the Hegemon in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn ceremonies. One final deity that can be ascribed to Jupiter is Amun Ra, known as \"The Only One\", \"The First Peerless\", \"The Sacred God\", \"King of the Gods\", \"He who lives by Right and by Truth\", \"The Creator of all that is\", \"Lord of Infinite Space\", \"King of Kings\", \"Primal Might\", \"Light of the World\", \"Governor of the World\", \"Lord of Time\", \"Master of Eternity\", \"Mighty Bowl of the Mother\", \"The Ram\", \"The Great Crackler\", \"Lord of the Double Plumes.\" His image is of the god who appears wearing a kilt, a corset, and a collar. He wears a beard and his flat topped helmet is surmounted by double plumes, each plume having double sections divided vertically, or by that of the solar disk and the plumes. In his right hand he bears the Ankh and in his left he holds the \"Scepter of Peaceful Authority.\" He is benevolent. He may have a ram's head bearing the Ankh and Ouas while wearing the old kingdom headdress surmounted by the disk and plumes. Sometimes he may appear in full form as the ram with curling horns. From a personal horoscope and natal chart standpoint, there are many factors to consider in determining the framework of the process of self actualization, including the aspects of Jupiter on a house or position where it rules. Jupiter, which is an expanding and benevolent planet, takes place by means of the collective principle. We gain cooperation of others through the use of Jupiter. Such cooperation is based on shared social and religious attitudes with the purpose of providing for the collective needs of the community. Also, we see that Jupiter deals"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"87 with the moral and philosophic nature of an individual and determines the channels through which it will function. Jupiter is the planet of individual growth and self actualization. The Jupiterian principles are two-way processes. The individual cannot expect to receive from society without contributing in equal measure. Call it the law of karma if you will. A community, by combining resources and ability, can accomplish greater tasks and finer intricacies than the individual alone is capable of achieving. Jupiter indicates how we can serve this general welfare. Not only of ourselves but of course toward society and the greater work as a whole. If we have an afflicted Jupiter, we find difficulty in cooperating with others in commonly accepted modes of social behavior. We become hypocritical in our behavior. We see how Jupiter works with other planets to indicate how we cooperate with a large purpose in the social structure to which we belong. In conclusion, Jupiter can be used for talismanic and evocational work. The energies of Jupiter are very positive and affirming and are many times used for prosperity and increase. Increase is really the key word, not only in the material, but in the spiritual as well.

Mars has an elemental affinity with Fire. The planetary figure is the pentagon. There's an interesting connotation when you think that the pentagon in America is associated with war and the military.

An afflicted Mars can lead to inflammation, accidental injuries, hemorrhages, small pox, general eruptive maladies, infectious and contagious sicknesses, and those particularly associated with high and acute fevers, noralgae, hyperactivity and hypertension.

The god wears the Skhemti, the conjoined crown of upper and lower Egypt, upon his old kingdom headdress. He is garmented in kilt, battle corset, and collar. He bears the iron mace, the seerer, and the bow.

The goddess bears the papyrus scepter and the Ankh. Her old kingdom headdress is surmounted by the solar disk and encircling the Uraeus, or by the disk and horns of Hathor superimposed upon two multi- sectioned plumes, or the Uraeus alone upreared and empowered. The goddess may appear standing or she may be enthroned. On a personal level, in regards to personal horoscope, we see that the aspect of Mars indicates the ability for expression through dynamic and powerful action. Sometimes the action is constructive, other times the action is destructive. If Mars has stress aspects, we tend to act rashly, not considering the consequences of our actions. Our behavior becomes that of a raging fire. Afflicted Mars signifies an ill temper and possible outbursts of anger and violence. Mars energy needs to be constructively and purposely channeled. It must never be left free and unattended. Favorable aspects from Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn will help in this regard. Mercury gives mental insight, Jupiter gives altruistic motivation, and Saturn gives discipline. As an interesting side- note here, in a woman's horoscope Mars indicates the type of man she wishes to attract. In a man's horoscope, it represents the way he expresses his masculinity in attracting a woman. Mars has much to do with desire. There is an invisible link between Mars and Venus. Both are fiery planets. Most people are motivated by what they want to have.

In his right hand he holds the Ankh and in his left hand he grasps his \"Scepter of Peaceful Authority.\" In regards to the personal natal horoscope, all aspects of the Sun affect our basic selfhood and self identity in nature and use of our will power. The Sun represents the principle of potential and unfolding power. It does not make any difference how well our horoscope may be aspected; if the Sun is weak, it is likely that we will not go far in life. There would be a lack of basic energy, a lack of courage, and a lack of opportunity available in one's life. The Sun offers vitality. It offers strength. It offers balance because the Sun balances the energies of Jupiter and the energies of Mars. It is the visible dispenser of light to the earth. In conclusion, let us remember that the Sun is almost always invoked for health and healing purposes. It is invoked when one is suffering from depression and of course the invocation of the Sun is used as a balancing tool many times when other aspects are out of balance. It is also the most spiritual of all the major planets because it is the physical reflection of the rtk sphere.

Some of the astrological aspects of Venus when appearing in the horoscope indicate the areas of life most strongly influenced by the desire for companionship. Venus tells us how love is expressed on a one to one basis and the artistically creative tendencies that we all have. Venus indicates the area in which there is either ability or difficulty in closely relating with others, how and what area the social, romantic and sexual urges are expressed, in where we give love, how we give love, and how we receive joy and harmony. The strength of Venus in a horoscope indicates the capacity to create beauty, harmony, and material prosperity as well. It also explains how we have the ability to attract people and things which we love and desire.

In other aspects, his headdress is adorned with the lunar disk and the crescent. His face is emerald green, his skin is a burnt orange. Aspects of Mercury in a house position or in a horoscope involve the way we think and help determine the kind of mind we have. The predominant manner of thinking in the primary area of mental interest is indicated by the dominant aspects made to Mercury. This planet is neutral as far as mental communication, perception, memory and reasoning are concerned. It therefore takes on the coloring of the planet which closely aspects it in the sign and the house in which it is placed. One can achieve a high position without having a reasonably developed Mercury, for a mind is a coordinating factor or lens through which all other abilities must be focused and filtered. From a magical aspect Mercury can be used for increased knowledge and increased ability to be able to use your magic and thoughts for helping people with mental problems.

Also, the Moon is responsible for fertility, but there is also a strong cleansing and purification of the Moon. The Moon is a very important planet in the sense that it is the reflection of the Sun, and the Sun is the reflection of the light of rtk . So even in the dark of night, the light still shines through the Moon. Further, the dreams of the Moon are the sphere of potential realities of the Earth. Fertility, crops, and birth are all affected by the Moon, as well as many times our moods. The sephira for the Moon on the Tree of Life is dwsy . The Moon has an elemental affinity with Air. The planetary figure is the Nonagon. The olympic spirit of the Moon is Phul. A drawing is provided at the end of this lesson. Some of the negative effects of the Moon are maladies relating to accumulations of body fluids, abscesses, tumors, female disorders, afflictions of the stomach, chest colds, coughs, pneumonia, allergies, epilepsy, and recurring ailments in general. The sphere of Luna is under the auspices of dwsy . The Divine name is Shaddai El Chai, the Archangel is Gabriel, the Choir of Angels is Ashim, and the Heavens of Assiah is Levanah.

He bears the crook and flail. As a standing figure, he appears wearing the kilt and headdress of the old kingdom. The headdress is surmounted by the lunar disk and the crescent.

Her hand is placed upon the Sa symbol, a folded and bound papyrus denoting a magical protection. In her hand, she may also bear the Ankh which must rest upon the Sa. Her right hand may also rest upon the Sa symbol and may be extended holding an unopened bud of papyrus. Her old kingdom headdress, the back of which is an ornamental continuum reaching to the ground, is surmounted by a horn and disk or plumes. The Nodes of the Moon In the Golden Dawn tradition the planets of Neptune and Pluto are not widely used. However, the North and South Nodes of the Moon, Caput Draconis and Cauda"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"99 Draconis, were used to give more specific details in natal chart work. We still feel that these nodes should be used because they do give an indepth look at the natal chart. We consider, in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Pluto and Neptune more generational and Aeon-type planets than we do specific planets. Aspects of the North Node determine relationships to prevailing social trends and attitudes in their use of opportunities afforded by history in the making. The North Node brings occasions for increase as a Jupititerian connotation. Aspects of the South Node indicate what habit tendencies rising out of our past experience influence our present attitudes and behavior. Also, the South Nodes show the karmic influence of our past conduct. The South Node has a Saturn type influence and connotation. Since the beginning of time, occultists have been using the Moon for various magical workings. Invocations are done in the proper planetary hour and time in accordance with the Moon. Also, you will notice that most invocations are done on a waxing Moon, banishings are done on a waning Moon, and of course the dark Moon or no Moon at all is usually a time of inner growth, pathworking, and inner travel. The Moon again is a very powerful planet, particularly when it comes to sexual desire and urges as well as fertility in one's life. Final Notes This lesson is very important for planetary workings later on in your study. Understanding the aspects of the planets and learning as much as you can about the planets and how they not only affect our lives but how they can be used for magical invocation is very important. Often times, and with quiet humor, the Adepts of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn find that Outer Order members will say, \"All I need to do is invoke a certain kind of energy....\" We find that they do not know the proper steps for invoking specific energies. The first step, beyond all others, is to know all the qualities, the colors, and attributes of a particular planet. Otherwise, any other steps that you take in an invocation or evocation for magical use of that planet will be in vain.

This is better left to specific courses that are available on the market today. There are several fine books and many astrological courses that the student can purchase or subscribe to if an indepth interest in casting horoscopes is wished to be pursued. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn believes that there is a certain influence of the planets and the zodiacal signs that have an effect on our lives on a karmic level. Therefore, you will receive enough information in this grade to help in understanding each zodiacal sign. The understanding of these signs is critical for later ceremonial workings and in magical application. In reality, the occultist has to have a well built armament available to him to be able to decide how to handle any particular life-given situation. So, in essence, each zodiacal sign is a storehouse of a particular type of energy or mode of operation. Thus, should the occultist later decide to invoke that particular energy for personal use, it is imperative that he has a good basis of understanding of the energy. This applies not only to zodiacal energies, however, it is important to build a solid foundation of knowledge before beginning any particular task of invocation with any form of energy. The following is a chart that the students may consult from time to time. Memorization of the content is not required in the Theoricus grade. However, it will prove to be handy to the Theoricus who does plan on pursuing the grade of Adeptus Minor.

The triplicities can be dvided into three seperate catagories, aside from their classification as a triplicity. The Cardinal signs are: Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn. "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"103 These signs are called Cardinal because when the Sun is in these signs, it is in one of the four corners of the heavens at a turning point where it is forced to take another direction. In Aries, the Sun is in the far east. Cancer is in the topical point of the north where the Sun emanates the perpendicular rays of the Summer Solstice and consequently the greatest heat. Libra is the extreme western point of the Sun's path where the Sun turns away from the northern hemisphere. Finally, in the midwinter, the Sun is in Capricorn which is located at the farthest point south, where the horizontal rays leave the people of the north icy, cold. Zodiac literally means circle of animals. The symbols of the three signs are animalistic. Aries is the ram, Cancer the crab, and Capricorn the goat. The fourth is Libra, the scales, that represents the ideal toward which this class must strive. This is a brief synopsis of the Cardinal signs. The Fixed signs are: Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius. When the Fixed signs are on the angles of the first, fourth, seventh and tenth houses, they exert an irresistible force compelling the individual along certain lines. The setbacks which would take or steal the courage from a person with a Cardinal sign do not seem to dominate a person with a Fixed sign on the angles. They seem to know no defeat and therefore they usually seem to achieve their goal in the end. This is done by their concentration upon one point that gives them persistence in the following of their chosen path. Likewise, those people with a Fixed sign many times are very conservative. Overall, people with a Fixed sign are known to be the most reliable people in the world either for good or for bad. Be it one way or the other, they can be considered reliable. The third type of signs are known as the Common signs. The Common signs are: Gemini, Sagittarius, Virgo, and Pisces. One expression that is used today in place of the term Common is the word \"Mutable.\" The reason that the words Common or Mutable are used is that these signs are very flexible. The powers of the common signs deal more in mental and spiritual areas. They seem to give purpose to an action as well as an incentive to the nobility of life. Generally these Common or Mutable signs are non-violent in nature. They can be intensely moral, intensely intellectual and intensely spiritual in nature. One of their weaknesses and strengths is the fact that they are swayed to and fro. Nothing appeals to a Mutable sign permanently. They desire nothing as much as change. They seem to live by the maxim: \"A rolling stone gathers no moss.\" For example, if someone who is a Mutable sign were to receive a job offer in one city, and at the same time is given another job offer from across the world for the same amount of money, chances are they would take the offer from across the world. Comparing this to the person that is a Cardinal sign, the Cardinal sign would take the offer that is closest to home; whereas the person who is a Fixed sign would probably not even change his job unless it is definitely a part of his goal structure."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"104 As mentioned earlier in this lesson, there are many books and courses available for one who wishes to go in depth.

Arians like to initiate new activities which keep them very occupied until the novelty wears off. Aries is mythologically represented by a ram and the symbol describes most accurately those born under its influence. A pointed and sharp protruding sheep-like nose, a wide forehead, pointed chin, and a triangular face are usually noted in people that are of an Arian nature. A light brown or reddish tint to the hair is a pronounced characteristic of the Arian. Generally, the body is slender and well formed.

It is not critical for the Theoricus to memorize the plants that have been given in this lesson or the attributes of each and every sign as they apply to the physical characteristics of a person born with that sign. The intent of this lesson is to give the Theoricus an overview of the twelve zodiacal signs as they apply to magical purposes, as well as in the application to individuals. This will allow the Theoricus to have a greater understanding of the zodiacal sign and its nature in the hopes that this knowledge will be used in later magical and esoteric workings. The key phrases for the zodiacal signs should be memorized along with the animal. We feel that with these basics, the Theoricus will have a solid foundation for the future grades.

Basically, each and every house is related to one sign of the zodiac. The houses, on a physical notation, are defined by the Earth's twenty-four hour rotation on its axis whereas the signs of the zodiac are defined by the Earth's yearly revolution around the sun. The houses are called Mundane houses to more easily differentiate them from the Celestial houses. The Celestial houses are known as the twelve signs of the zodiac. We will refer to the Mundane houses as houses only. It is the angle of the stella ray which helps determine its effect on our lives. For example, we understand that planets which are in the east generally affect our physical constitution, whereas planets which are located in the south near the Zenith are factors for good or ill, affecting our social position. If a planet is setting in the west during the time of one's birth, its stella rays strike us in such a manner as to draw us to a certain marriage partner. The planets that are under the Earth have more of an affect on our condition during the latter stages of our lives. Let's take an issue concerning someone born at sunrise on the day when the sun and Jupiter are in conjunction. We can say then that the stella rays strike him from an eastern angle and thus give him a lot of vitality and enthusiasm. Another person may be born on the same day at approximately noon, when Jupiter and the Sun are at the Zenith's position, this person may have a poor and weak body. The second person would be more inclined to a social sphere and would find himself in public favor and honor. A third illustration concerning another child born during Jupiter and the Sun's setting in the west is that this child may be an outcast on condition that the planets in the east and south so decree. The third child will find that he will have successful partnerships and that he will find himself truly loved by his mate. The houses are grouped according to the basic influence that they tend to exert in our lives. The houses are defined as angular, cadent, and succeedent. We also have personal, spiritual, material, and mystical houses. Essentially, the intention here is to divide the houses into their kinds; like attractions and like influences so to speak, much in the same way that we do with the zodiac when divided by their triplicities. Of the angles, we know that the first house governs the self. If we look at its opposite, the seventh house, we see that it rules the one nearest and dearest to us, mainly our spouse or a loved one of some sort. The fourth house determines the condition within our homes. Again, if we look at the angle of the tenth house, which is the opposite, it shows our social standing in the community that we live. Thus we can see that the angles show collectively the sphere of activities in our own personal lives. The second house, a succeedant house, shows our financial status or prosperity in regards to how we acquire it through our own efforts and work. The opposite succeedent house, the eighth house, shows whatever we may receive from others. This can also be indicated through a legacy or inheritance. The other succeedent houses, the fifth and the eleventh, show how our income may be spent. The fifth house indicates the children of our own blood who have claim to some share of our income. The eleventh house shows the children of our brains which are mainly our hopes, our wishes and our aspirations, which also have a tendency to withdraw from our resources as well through emotional, mental and in many cases financial means."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"121 Of the two cadent houses, the sixth house is a house of voluntary services which we perform as our share of the world's work in exchange for an equal portion of the world's wealth. By the same token, we have the opposite house, the twelfth house, which shows how we may be compelled into labor without renumeration under, say for example, prison restraint of some sort. This in itself may not just be limited to a physical prison. The sixth house shows the state of our health. In the twelfth house we can find out if treatments are necessary. We have another pair of cadent houses, the third and the ninth houses, showing how our lives and our work will confine us to one place or if it will require us to travel and change residences from time to time. There are some people who will establish a home and spend the rest of their lives there whereas others tend to move from time to time over short periods. This is all revealed through the sixth house. In this respect, the third house shows short journeys and the ninth house shows long travels. The personal houses comprise the first, fifth, and ninth houses. The first house basically rules your constitution and the physical body. Planets and signs in that house tend to put their imprint on it, to mar it according to the nature of its self generated destiny. Our fifth house shows the love nature of our soul, in the line of its personal expression. The ninth house shows as much spirit that we can comprehend at our present limited state. Next, we move on to the category called the \"Trinity houses.\" This is one that will concern many, consisting of the second, sixth and the tenth houses. This shows our worldly possessions with our means of obtaining them, and the enjoyment that they will bring to us. On the other hand, wealth or poverty is shown in the second house. Health, without which there can be no joy in any worldly possession, is shown in the sixth house. Public prestige, which is shown in our ego gratification, is shown in the tenth house. The social houses are the third, seventh and eleventh houses. They define and show our various relationships with those we meet in our life long journey. Brothers and sisters related by blood are shown in the third house. Our heart mate or soul mate, with whom our blood will blend with in a different way, is shown in the seventh house. Our friends are shown in the eleventh house. Next, we come to the last trinity of houses composing the fourth, eighth and the twelfth houses. In these houses we could say that the hidden mysteries of life and the spirit and of post modern experiences immediately following the \"Terminus Vitale\" are found. On the Material plane, we have the fourth house which signifies the condition of our lives in the latter stages. The twelfth house shows sorrow which impresses us with the hopelessness of material things and, in that sense, the twelfth house is a very important one. The eighth house indicates the nature of our exit from the world's stage. In other words, it will explain to us more clearly how we will transpose ourselves from the physical plane into the next stage of existence. The houses are essentially important in the Golden Dawn System simply because they are used in advanced Tarot work and geomancy, as well as in the understanding of the creation of natal charts and astrological work. The Order does not proport to spend an indepth length of time in the study of Astrology, however, it still ties in very closely with the Qabalah and its correspondences. From that standpoint, a basic understanding of the houses is essential to the Theoricus."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"122 We have to understand that in the journey from the cradle to the grave we carry around these twelve houses. They are imprinted in the auric sphere surrounding us. As the air envelops the Earth, the houses envelope us. Each house, in effect, will mirror part of our existence. Each house holds some specific karmic lesson that is important to our understanding. Each represents how we have worked before in a given department of our life's task, particularly if referring to past incarnations. At an appropriate time in our life, in accordance with the houses, we reap what we sow in a past life. That is, unless we can forestall the harvest through the use of spiritual development and growth through the mystical systems. Right now only brief surface coverage of this topic has been given. Let us examine our own personal lives and find if there is something being repeated over and over again. For example, the subject of friends. Is our seventh house afflicted? Is it negatively aspected? Do friends betray and forsake us and leave us heartsick? We need to examine our natal horoscope. It reveals what is hidden in our auric atmosphere. Once the weakness or the affliction is understood, we then can take magical, personal, psychological, and spiritual steps to overcome this affliction. Thus, we have literally changed our houses and their influences, and their predetermined influences. This lesson may have covered more than is needed for this particular grade in the study of the houses, but keep in mind that the coverage is itended to convey a general understanding. A list of the twelve houses is being presented. It illustrates their government and force of influence. This is important to memorize, for its use will be practically applied in Geomantic work as well as with the Tarot.

The Thirty-second path of the Sepher Yetzirah , which answereth unto the letter t , is called the Administrative Intelligence, and it is so-called because it directeth and associateth in all their operations, the seven planets, even all of them in their own due courses. To it, therefore, is attributed the due knowledge of the Seven Abodes of Assiah, the Material World, which are symbolized in the Apocalypse by the seven churches. It refers to the Universe as composed of the four elements, to the Kerubim, to the Qlippoth, and to the astral plane. It is the reflection of the sphere of Saturn. It represents the connecting and binding link between the Material and Formative Worlds, Assiah and Yetzirah, and necessarily passes through the astral plane, the abode of the elementals and the shells of the dead. It is the Rending of the Veil of the Tabernacle, whereon the Kerubim and the palm trees are depicted. It is the Passing of the Gate of Eden. These ideas are symbolically resumed in the representation of the twenty-first Key of the Tarot. Within the oval formed of the seventy-two circles, is a female form, nude save for a scarf that floats round her. She is crowned with the Lunar Crescent of Isis, and holds in her hands, two wands. Her legs form a cross. She is the Bride of the Apocalypse, the Qabalistic Queen of the Canticles, the Egyptian Isis, or Great Feminine Kerubic Angel Sandalphon on the left hand of the Mercy Seat of the Ark. The Wands are the directing forces of the positive and negative currents. The seven-pointed heptagram or star alludes to the Seven Palaces of Assiah; the crossed legs to the symbol of the four letters of the Tetragrammaton. The surmounting crescent receives alike the influences of hrwbg and Gedulah. She is the synthesis of the thirty-second path, uniting twklm to dwsy . The oval of the seventy-two smaller circles refers to the Schemhamporesch, or Seventy-two fold name of Deity. The twelve larger circles form the zodiac. At the angles are the four Kerubim which are the vivified powers of the letters of the name YHVH operating in the elements, through which you have just symbolically passed in the preceding ceremony. The fan, lamp, cup and salt represent the four elements themselves whose inhabitants are the Sylphs, Salamanders, Undines and Gnomes. Be thou, therefore, prompt and active as the Sylphs, but avoid frivolity and caprice. Be energetic and strong as the salamanders, but avoid irritability and ferocity. Be flexible and attentive to images, like the Undines, but avoid idleness and changeability; be laborious and patient like the Gnomes, but avoid grossness and avarice. So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy soul, and fit thyself to command the spirits of the elements. Esoteric Information The Universe card is the first card we meet on the Tree of Life. It is path thirty- two. We are on the physical plane ascending back to the higher spiritual plane. The"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"127 doorway for our ascension into the spiritual plane is the Universe card or t , path thirty- two. This path leads from twklm , known as the Kingdom or the Earth, to dwsy , referred to as the Foundation. The path color is indigo. The meaning of t is cross or equal-armed cross. It is a double letter which means power and servitude. The esoteric title of the Universe or the World card is the \"Great One of the Night of Time\". The planet of this path is Saturn, but do not let this mislead you. Actually, this path balances all energies and planets at one time. With that in mind, Saturn becomes a focal point of general meaning and workings. The Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom refer to path thirty-two as administrative intelligence. It is through this administrative intelligence that it directs the overall operation of all of the seven ancient planets. Symbolically, this path connects the Earth with the balanced power of the Microprosopus, represented by the hexagram. The first letter of the Hebrew alphabet is a . t is the last letter. Between a and t rests the entire Universe. This is referred to in Christian and Greek terms as the Alpha and Omega, or the beginning and the end. The Sepher Yetzirah refers to t as the Palace of Holiness, sustaining all things. It is both power and servitude. The center of the cube of space, as referred to in the Sepher Yetzirah , is the letter t , the cross. It connects a , m , and c , the three mother letters. This is the symbolic form of energy from which manifestation was created. The path of the Universe or the World is in fact the secret to all of this, because it falls at a point where a , m , and c all cross. This crossing point is where these primary energies are balanced. The key word for this path is balance. It is the Sanctum Sanctorum of the devotional Mysteries. One symbol that we apply to both the Fool and Universe cards, a and t , the beginning and the end, is the Swastika. In rtk , it must be realized that its arms spin so rapidly that they merge and are in fact perceived as a unified point, or the primordial point. On the path of the Universe, the Swastika has slowed its spinning, so that each of the arms is perceptible and are seen to be perfectly balanced around a central point. This is the complete expression of the \"One\" in matter. Keep in mind that when contemplating the Universe card we are really contemplating the world of matter. The Universe is a total balance and integration. Most of us think of ourselves as body and mind. Yet the Western Mysteries, and the Eastern Mysteries for that matter, have stated since almost the beginning of time that the Cosmos or the Universe is in fact an illusion, or basically all in the mind. With this thought in mind, we realize that the distinction between body and mind is one of perception, not of reality. In fact, in our path working experience, when we close our eyes and see visualization or pictures, what we are actually doing is witnessing the most refined forms of matter. "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"128 Behind the exterior of the Universe card, we must also realize that most of the physical world is actually unseen. To experience the path of the Universe is to be taken to the gateway of the Seven Palaces of Assiah. This is represented by the seven- pointed star. As you enter the Holy of Holies, the Universe, you may experience forces in such a unique way that you are in them but not yet of them. Also, keep in mind that, opposed to other paths, the energies that you will experience in the Universe card, particularly in pathworking, are also in full expression and self-balanced. This perhaps is one reason why the equal-armed cross is considered one of the tools of the path of t . To successfully travel this path, one must have some self-understanding and balance to begin with. This is very important. This path should not be traveled when one is out of balance, for your lack of balance on a balanced path that opens the doorway to higher realms of consciousness will do nothing but cause serious problems in the personality. A word of caution, test all symbols with reason and understanding. This is the doorway to the Astral, into higher paths and planes of consciousness. Let us make sure we are not merely entertaining ourselves with extended fantasy. By doing this, we only deceive ourselves, and self-deception hinders our growth. The Universe, because it contains all things, is a path of discrimination. As you work this path, remember to be discriminating in the direction you choose to go on the path and the energies you choose to invoke within your consciousness. It is critically important that beginners on this path establish a sense of balance with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. Those of us who at one time or another felt that the Archangels were merely fantasies have had our mind changed by invoking them through the L.B.R.P. on the path of t . Their extreme amount of brilliance and power is exemplified through the balance of this particular path. Most Tarot cards have a wheel or oval-shaped wheel, a woman within the wheel, and the four Kerubim depicted on the Universe or World card. The symbolism behind this is that only through discrimination can we place ourselves in the administrative. Balance is symbolized by the dancing woman draped with a k shaped scarf (the letter attributed to the Wheel of Fortune) and surrounded by the animal symbols of the four elements. The symbology here is quite Qabalistic in that it represents the four elements united by the fifth element of Spirit. It is the fifth element of Spirit that balances the four elements. One of the primary principles of this path is to learn the edict, \"As above, so below\". In hnyb , hnyb of course attributed to the Great Mother and symbolized also by Saturn, we have the exalted supernal realm. We, also have what we call, \"The Will to Form\" or \"The Will to Express\". This is later expressed by the Universe card on path"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"129 thirty-two as actual expression, or final expression, or fullest expression of the Great Mother. This Great Mother can be represented by the Empress or Isis or Aimah Elohim. She is hnyb ; she is Saturn; she is all the principles behind what we perceive as matter; she is the Cosmic Dancer as depicted on the Universe card who administers and balances the four elements. Most of the Tarot decks, as pointed out earlier, agree that the female figure should be surrounded by an oval shape of some sort. In the Golden Dawn Tarot, the oval shape is surrounded by seventy-two little dots or stars. These seventy-two little dots or stars represent the Schemhamporesch, or the seventy- two fold name of God. The oval shape gives reference to the womb. It is through the womb of the human female that we pass from gestation unto birth. It is through the Great Womb that we pass from life into death. It is also through this womb that we pass from the physical plane of twklm into the astral plane of Foundation, otherwise known as dwsy . The woman in the Tarot card of the Universe, as pointed out earlier, is dancing. She is in movement, swirling and revolving, rather than as a more settled form of energy, as depicted in the Empress card where she is placed solidly on the Supernal Throne. This energy, or spiral force of Nature, is directed by the wands which she carries. The wands represent both active and passive energy, each one having two poles. In many cards, one wand is black and the other wand is white. Some might consider the path of the Universe a dark cave filled with treachery, danger and tunnels. But remember that through this Darkness and through this treachery, we are led to the pathway of light which leads inevitably through dwsy into trapt . Let us also remember that it is through this pathway that we end up in the realm of the Qlippoth. Therefore, our own personal balance is heavily stressed. One must be in the right frame of mind and balanced by the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram to begin their higher realm workings.

Some historians believe that geomancy began in ancient China, or some place in the Far East. Others seem to think that it may have originated in Africa or in some areas of the Middle East. It really doesn't matter where geomancy began. The fact of the matter is, however, that it is an extremely accurate way for divining any particular answer. One of the problems that we often run into is the fact that those who are studying the esoteric traditions and Mysteries often skip over or underestimate the use of geomancy. This is a tragedy simply because geomancy is such a precise form of divination. Overall, geomancy, as far as a divinatory process, far outweighs most other methods. In the Theoricus grade, we will introduce you to geomancy with this lesson. However, the method of its use will be omitted until the next grade. It is very important that the houses and their meanings be memorized for effective use of the operation. Such a procedure calls for thorough knowledge of what each house signifies. Doing this will establish a clearer view of geomancy and its method, simply because geomancy and the houses are closely related. Furthermore, in this grade you'll need to memorize the rulers of the planets. These rulers will be used in accordance with the actual method of divination. So, all in all, the necessary materials to be familiar with include the memorization of the geomantic figures, their meanings, their attributed zodiacal sign, the element of the figure, and the ruler of the planet. These are the main correspondences that must be committed to memory for an effective geomantic divination. Geomancy is basically the various groupings of odd and even points that come together in four lines. Of these there can only be obtained sixteen possible combinations. Therefore, we take these combinations of odd and even points and arrange them on four lines, which then relate to the sixteen figures of geomancy. As for the memorization requirements of this grade, you will use the knowledge of the points already stated above. Two figures are attributed to each of the seven ancient planets. The remaining figures are attributed to Cauda and Caput Draconis, the tail and head of the Dragon respectively. These are otherwise known as the North and South Nodes of the Moon. In addition to each particular planet and sign, certain ruling genii are also attributed. We can equate the genii to each particular sign and planet. In this lesson we are going to give you the particular geomantic figure as it pertains to falling in a particular house. In the Practicus grade you will learn how to determine which house or sign a geomantic figure would fall under. It is not necessary to memorize all of the explanations that fall under each of the houses, however, it is important that you familiarize yourself with some of the main headings. In any case, the elaborate information is here for any future reference. Here is the table of the geomantic figures as they pertain to the twelve houses. Under the heading of each figure is stated the general effect of the figure regardless of the house. "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 133 !! !! ! ! Generally good for profit or gain. 1.

Mastery over the elements and understanding the nature of the elements, especially the elements within one's psyche, is absolutely critical and vital to the student who wants to proceed to Adepthood. You cannot hope to invoke the elements and focus them in a particular direction through the use of will unless you have complete mastery over them. So in this lesson, we introduce you to the Primal Elements within the psyche of all of us. These are the Tattwas of the Eastern school of magic. In many ways, they are different from so many other symbols that we use in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in that they are primal and simple. Unlike the Tarot, wherein many versions are complex and full of minute details, the Tattwas are exceedingly simple. In this, however, lies danger. Oftentimes, the Theoricus will say, \"This is too simple for me,\" \"I want something more complex,\" \"why am I given this easy of a task?\" The reason is really quite elementary once the concept of the Tattwas is understood. The Tattwas allow you to be in touch with the basic, primal and primitive elements that exist on a Microcosmic level and which connect into a Macrocosmic level. Therefore, the student that learns to master and understand more of himself through the use of the Tattwas will also have the ability to master and understand the elements as a whole. This can range to developing powers such as healing, increase prosperity, and yes, even the controlling of the weather, as well as a myriad of other benefits. This can only be achieved by working the Tattwas on a continual basis. Most weaknesses found in Adepts are those concerning the elements that tend to be imbalanced within them. Oftentimes, as people move through the grades, eventually reaching Adeptus Minor, they tend to spend more time with the Enochian system, advanced Qabalah, Egyptian rites, and Goetic work. This is not to say that spiritual time is not being pursued. At this point, most of today's Adepts have forgotten the use of the Tattwas. The Tattwas must become our basic foundation for increased awareness and balance within ourselves and of the elements. It is only this system of balancing that allows progression on the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Balance, and the ability to balance the elements, is absolutely crucial. If you remember in the study of pathworking it is said that only the path of t is self-balanced. The other paths must be balanced by the practitioner who is working them. So consequently, you must have the skills and ability to balance those paths immediately and effectively, otherwise you may be thrown into endless day-dreaming and mind trickery that will accomplish nothing. The five basic Tattwa symbols are a combination of the four magical elements intermingled with the fifth element of Spirit. The first is Prithivi; it is a yellow square that represents the Primal Element of Earth. (If you are confused as to the color symbology of the Tattwas, just keep in mind that they are derived from the Eastern school of magic). The Second is Apas; it is a silver crescent moon, representing the Primal Element of Water. The third is Vayu; a blue circle representing the Primal Element of Air. The fourth is Tejas; a red triangle that represents the Primal Element of Fire. Lastly, we have Akasha; a black ovoid that represents the Primal Element of Spirit. So all together, we have the five elements composed of the four magical elements adjoined with the fifth element of Spirit. In addition to these, each element can be subdivided into a total of twenty-five sub-elements. For example, Vayu Prithivi would be the Air aspect of Earth. This would be portrayed as a small blue circle on a"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 144 large yellow square. For the Theoricus grade, it is only required to make a set of the first five, which are the one's stated above. However, if you wish to construct the sub- elements, that is fine, so long as the magical work be consistent and regulated. One of the advantages of building the sub-elemental cards is that it aides, particularly in the area of magical workings, in understanding the various aspects of one elemental association with another. It also allows one to be more precise with one's working, especially in the area of directing one's ritual work involving invoking a combination of various elements. At this point, you should have already committed to memory the basic attributes of the various elements. Tips For Building Tattwas Cards Your Tattwa symbols should be about 2\"-2 1/2\" in height. This is not the size of the card itself. A good 5x7 card is recommended or a large size filing card that is pure white and blank. We recommend that colored paper be used for the actual creation of the symbol rather than water colors. This is because the color of the symbol should have a brilliance and a deep tone to it. Lacquer paints or testor paints are also acceptable. However, it would be best that two coats be used for a deeper effect. If you are going to use paints, it is recommended that the the symbol be traced using the suggested measurements. Then paint it and be sure to place a second coat on top of that when it has dried. At this point, you should be able to obtain a rich, deep color. The next step is to take the symbol, cut it out, and then paste the symbol onto another blank white card. The reason behind not suggesting to paint directly onto only one card is that using one card will give only a one dimensional look to it. While on the other hand, by using the paint and paste method, you receive a two dimensional perspective. The next step is to place several coats of a good lacquer or varathane on both sides of the card. There are a large number of brands of liquid plastics available on the market. A good glossy finish will help protect the card for a vivid and bright look as well as ensuring years of use. If you are going to use the colored paper method as taught originally by the Order, then we would suggest that after the colored symbol has been cut out, directly transport it onto the blank white card, following the last step of adding a final coat of varathane. Working The Tattwas The things that you will need in order to begin your Tattwa vision and workings are as follows. 1. The selected Tattwa card. Our recommendation is that you start off with Prithivi as this is the most dense of the five. A side note: the student should work on this card a minimum of five times before moving to the other cards. 2. Blank white screen, wall, or some sort of background."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 145 3. A notebook or your magical diary to record the experiences. 4. A room that you may use without any outside disturbances for a certain amount of time. 5. Any item that will give you comfort during your working, such as a pillow or a soft cushion. It is advisable that the latter should not be too accommodating for it may cause one to fall asleep and therefore lose the entire magical time to slumber. Begin by clearing your space with the L.B.R.P. and the B.R.H.. You then face the direction of the elemental quarter that you are working. Take the card and place it upon the screen or wall, usually at the height of eye level. If you don't have a white wall available, you may choose to go out and buy a large piece of artist construction paper or maybe even perhaps going to a butcher shop where you can obtain a sheet of the paper that they use for wrapping meat. The reason for the use of the white paper is so that no distractions may interfere with your mind when concentrating upon the symbol of the element. You may also want to remove any hanging pictures or any furniture that is too close to the working area. Another useful tip is to place your card on the ceiling and lay on the floor. This is a very good method although not the easiest for some since many people don't have the option of using a white, smooth ceiling. You may sit or lie down during the operation, although lying down may cause drowsiness. Face the symbol, relaxed and alert, gaze upon it for approximately twenty seconds to one minute or as long as you can, but do not gaze to the point of strain. Do not allow your attention to wander. This is also an excellent time for using the Four Fold Breath while gazing at the symbol. The next step is to smoothly switch your gaze onto the plain white surface behind the symbol before continuing any further. You may at this point wish to remove the Tattwa card from the white background. You will notice the transference of the symbol into a complimentary color of the Tattwa that has just been removed. If you were using Tejas, the complimentary color you will see is apple green, etc.. We recommend that the student practice the exercise a minimum three to four times until a strong development of transferring the Tattwa card visually onto the white background is obtained. Upon achieving success with the method thus far, let the student continue, holding the complimentary image of the Tattwa firmly in his mind, or visually upon the white background. After doing this, if you have visualized the image with your eyes opened, you may close them and visualize the image becoming enlarged to the size of a door. Visualize yourself now and portray all the details of yourself and the doorway. Pass on through the door leaving your body laying, seated or standing behind. Most Adepts have preferences of working Tattwas while standing up, which isn't simple. Using the Sign of the Enterer, also a symbol of one groping for the Light, you enter that realm of existence and seal yourself there for a period of time using the Sign of Horus or the Sign of Silence. You may then want to look around the plane, noting in detail all of the scenes being observed. You may notice that things appear unanimated. The easiest and best way to animate things and to bring them to a"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 146 vivid color and movement is in the use of the appropriate Divine names and angelic names for each primary element.

Element Cardinal Point Earth Tzaphon Air Mizrach  Fire Darom  Water Maarab  Upon entering the actual Tattwa plane and vibrating the appropriate Divine name and Angelic names, you may notice a guide appearing in your experience. It is recommended and advisable that you not venture far away from the doorway without the help of a guide for Tattwa work. Upon meeting the guide, he should be tested by every means disposable to the student. As in the case of using the pentagram, it may not be appropriate when working Prithivi. Some tools that may be included for testing are the Banner of the West or the vibration of the Divine names (which prove to be quickest and the most effective). Be sure not to omit asking the entity its purpose in its assisting you. Let it be emphasized that the Banishing Earth Pentagram is acceptable, except while working Prithivi. Using it may cause the banishing of positive earth elements. Moreover, positive spirits can be banished using the banishing pentagram for each particular element. So make sure you are familiar with the banishing elemental pentagrams. Assuming now that you have a positive spirit that is willing to help you and act as a guide, the next step is to give the grade sign for the particular element. So in working Earth, you would give the Grade Sign of the Zelator. For working Air, you give the Theoricus Grade Sign, etc.. However, there may be a problem. This lesson is only applicable to the Theoricus grade. So for those of you who may become proficient at"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 147 the Tattwas, you would not have access to the powers of the higher grade signs. As a general rule, you can always give the Neophyte Grade Sign including the Sign of Silence. Even the Adepts of the Order prefer to use the Sign of the Neophyte most of the time when working with spirits on another plane. The spirit or helper should be expected to return the same grade sign to you. This is very important to assure yourself that the requirements of your test have been met. Should a spirit neglect to return a similar grade sign, then chances are that you are confronting a spirit that isn't appropriate for your working. Thus, the only action necessary at that point is to banish the entity using the corresponding elemental pentagram. In working the sub-elements such as Fire of Earth, it is possible that you will be working with more than one guide, being transferred from one element to the next. At no time should you allow a lapse in your testing of any entities. Be specific, direct, and efficient. The Divine names should be employed at all times, as they will almost always bring harmony and organization to a plane of existence which for one reason or another has become chaotic with your presence. If you are working a secondary Tattwa such as Fire of Earth, when you enter initially you will be first entering the element of Earth and then the sub-plane of Fire. Again, upon entering that sub-plane, the Divine names should be vibrated. For most of you in the Theoricus grade, you will not be working the sub-planes for any particular length of time to come, but it is important that you know this information. It's important also to know exactly where your point of existence is located. In working a sub-plane, obviously something dressed in bright colors with very hot jewels and very bright piercing eyes is probably not of the element of Earth. It may be most likely attributed to the element of Fire. Thus you will want to vibrate the appropriate Divine names. Most of the time our guides on these elemental planes will be elementals, but they should still be treated with the utmost respect and courtesy according to their rank. However, never allow them to get out of will. Elements are very pure and simple beings, but they must be treated with firmness, precise decision, and respect. Often times, they can be mischievous and irresponsible, even though they are not of a malicious nature. Another suggestion is to always project yourself as larger or taller than the being who is confronting you. In all cases, always maintain composure and self-control. At first, you may only want to glance at the scenery, but later, through continued practice, you will be able to help people by the use of elemental work on the Tattwa plane by working closely with the elemental beings of that plane. The method of leaving the Tattwa plane and returning to normal consciousness is the precise reversal of the initial process. The first thing to do is thank the guide (if you have one, but in most cases you will) and bid him farewell. Then you will retrace your footsteps back to your symbolic door which will appear again in the opposite color of the Tattwa card you were using. There should never be a sudden departure from the plane of existence. This includes opening your eyes and feeling that everything is normal. This is misleading and it will result in causing havoc in your daily life. This will not only occur within the next few days, but in weeks and years to come. So after finding the elemental door, you will pass through, again using the Sign of the Enterer followed by the Sign of Horus (using the left finger, not the right to press against the"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 148 lips). Remember that the Sign of the Enterer is always answered by the Sign of Silence. Upon completing your journey, slowly open your eyes and perform the L.B.R.P., followed by the B.R.H.. As an added precaution, it is always good upon completing the B.R.H. to give the final release. Simply hold the right hand up facing east or the direction of the element that was worked and say, \"I now release any spirits that may have been imprisoned by this ceremony and working, return to thy own abodes and habitations with the blessings of the Divine One. I now declare this working and rite duly ended.\" It is wise to do Tattwa working no more than three times weekly when first starting out. Only after practicing over an extended period of time will the inner clairvoyance develop in the student. Only with perseverance will the visions grow from vague, slightly indistinguishable pictures, to a vivid, powerful, magical experience. However, even when these experiences begin to become vivid and powerful, you should always maintain your testing of all things on these planes. For remember, the astral plane seeks to deceive. In addition, with considerable practice, the actual Tattwa cards will be discarded. The seer will become so proficient in using the Tattwa cards and performing the visions that the actual card will not be necessary. You will merely visualize the card, project it onto its alternate color, and then project into it. It is wise not to work Akasha until one has achieved the Portal grade and higher. Work the elementals, and even the sub-elements, if you choose to make them, on a regular basis prior to working the element of Spirit. As a safeguard, there are some other Divine names and Angelic names that are used for Akasha that are not put in this lesson that are required for satisfactory working for that particular element. The Theoricus grade is not requiring that you become a master at Tattwa working, but you should have begun to practice its work on a regular basis. This is hard, strenuous work, so don't kid yourself, because it isn't easy. In some cases it takes months and sometimes years to become proficient. But with persistence, all of the above benefits are possible and can be achieved.

This is the tool of the Theoricus and it is the representation of his power. There have been many contradictions about the tool that ought to be used to represent this element. The traditional Golden Dawn elemental tool for Air is the dagger. Perhaps a little background on its history might be helpful. It was popular in the early years of paganism for the practitioners to ascribe the magical wand to the element of Air. Others, in their own magical experience, ascribed the sword to air. So the question to ask is,\"Why is it significant that the dagger be used to symbolize the element of Air?\" Well, the best way to answer this would be to recognize a well known author by the name of Gerald B. Gardner. He is one of several people responsible for reviving witchcraft, or at least a reconstruction of it. In his methods and theories, he was able to simplify some seemingly complex magical techniques and philosophies (some were even borrowed by Aleister Crowley). Teaming up with another knowledgeable person, Doreen Valiente, he was able to create the book entitled Modern Witchcraft . One of his works dealt with equating the dagger with the sword. This should be obvious, for the sword would appear to be nothing more than a large dagger. It was believed that the sword would be a suitable tool to represent Air because a sword is swung in the air. The dagger was used as a later version of this concept. This is so because a dagger was very similar to the tip of a spear which would hurl through the air when thrown. If you recall, in the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, the Archangel Michael holds a sword and he among all the Archangels is ascribed to Fire. According to ancient Greek tradition, it is stated, \"The sword is a gift from the gods.\" You can say that the gods are Spirit and Spirit broken down by definition means \"breath\" or \"Air.\" These are only theories of how the dagger came about. Even though we can't say these are the most accurate answers concerning the tool of Air, they are a basis for your understanding. The Air Dagger is perhaps one of the easiest tools to create. Merely purchase a dagger and paint it. The traditional Air Dagger is a simple double-edged blade with a \"T\" shaped handle as shown below. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 151 The Air Dagger should be fairly new and should have never been used previously to cut living things, not even meat. As an Adept, this tool is used in all magical workings of Air, such as Qabalistic workings to Enochian magical rituals. Let there be no confusion between the Air Dagger and the L.B.R.P. dagger or sword. The L.B.R.P. dagger or sword is under the auspices of hrwbg and it symbolizes strength and defense. The Air Dagger represents Air, w of YHVH, and the Archangel Raphael. There are no specific requirements to the type of dagger you purchase. It may be made of wood, steel, pewter, or anything else. Just keep in mind that the Air Dagger is your tool. It should have the appearance you feel is best suited to your liking and it should be durable for years of use. There are a variety of cutlery shops that supply double edged \"T\" handled daggers. Occult supply houses also have no problem furnishing a person with this kind of dagger at the right price. On the other hand, if you do have any problems finding a double edged \"T\" handled dagger, there is a solution, but it will take a little more effort. It isn't so much the double edged blade that is a problem as compared to finding one that has a \"T\" shape large enough to look traditional. One suggestion that would be useful is to use modeling clay. Simply purchase a fairly small amount of clay that doesn't chip or crack at a hardware store and get to work. On the traditional dagger, the part of the dagger that goes horizontal, crossing the blade, is slightly curving toward the point. It isn't exactly perpendicular to the blade. Using clay, you'll be able to mold and shape the desired figure. After the clay has dried, sand the handle until all lumps and rough edges are smooth. If the handle of the dagger is wooden, be sure that it has been sanded smooth prior to painting. Cover it with a couple of coats of wood sealer. Make sure that the wood sealer has completely dried before painting for a smoother, solid appearance in the color. If a metal dagger is used, be sure to heed the instructions of the paint regarding painting over metals. In painting the dagger, the handle is painted yellow, whereas the sigils painted upon it are purple. Both of these colors should be brilliant and long lasting. If no other paint is available to you other than water colors, then they, too, may be used so long as several coats of varathane are sprayed on top of it as a finishing touch, to prevent peeling.

The motto is a short phrase or abbreviation that represents your goal or power. You should have the same motto on all your tools. You should have previously chosen a motto to place on your Earth Pantacle. This same motto can be painted on your Air Dagger. If the motto is still uncertain, an inspiration can probably be obtained from these examples: \"May my light shine\", \"LVX\", \"770\", or \"To be one with Light.\" You can even use your own power name for a motto, for even your own power or magical name shows some significance in achieving a specific goal in your quest toward Divine Light. When all the paint has dried, place a couple of coats of varathane for a clean and long lasting finish. Although the Order has the student constructing one tool per grade, it would be best not to place only two tools on your altar (referring to the Earth Pantacle as well). What is meant by this is that either all of the tools of the four elements are present or none of them. Having any of the elemental tools absent would cause an imbalance of a particular element within your magical working area. Wrap the tool in a white silk cloth or its own color and store it away where no one may touch or find it.

The tools may also be used when communing with the Archangel of the grade, in this case Raphael. Please do not take making these tools lightly, thinking that it will be a long while until you can use them properly. Make it a habit to use each tool as a representation of the grade you are at, as well as a symbol that represents your power to wield that particular element and control it. So, if you have built yourself an altar and have used alternate tools in place of the standard ones, you may now place the Air Dagger and the Earth Pantacle with those tools that represent the elements of Water and Fire. Just keep in mind that it is necessary to have an object representing each of the elements on the altar or none at all. A balance must be maintained at all times. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 l a pr } c j yjla ydc "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" LESSER INVOKING RITUAL OF THE PENTAGRAM MEDITATION WITH RAPHAEL \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 y h w h THEORICUS 2=9 "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 156 In the grade of 2=9 Theoricus, the student centers his attention on the element of Air. As we all know, Air relates to the mind and the process of fluidity of thought. By using the L.I.R.P. and communing with the Archangel Raphael, you may turn to him and ask him to help you clear your mind of unclear thinking or even perhaps bad or ill feelings and thoughts that you may have toward a particular situation. Moreover, he is there to help you solve a problem that you may be having trouble with or having difficulty figuring out. Raphael can send forth a simple solution through the rushing Air, while at the same time helping you become more attuned to the element of Air. When performing the L.I.R.P., you are invoking as opposed to banishing as in the L.B.R.P. Therefore, the pentagram drawn will be the Invoking Air Pentagram. Another difference will be that the Archangels will be facing toward you, instead of away from you. Step 1 Perform the Relaxation Ritual. A ritual cleansing bath is recommended, however, it is optional. Step 2 Perform the L.B.R.P.. (Optional.) Step 3 Perform the L.I.R.P.. Follow the same steps as the L.B.R.P., except substitute the Invoking Air Pentagram for the Banishing Earth Pentagram, and use the same Divine names.

Step 2 Stand facing east with your eyes closed and visualize a purple triangle on a yellow background. Now vibrate the Divine name Shaddai El Chai. No sooner will you say this and the great Archangel Raphael will appear before you. As you see him approaching you, give him the Theoricus grade sign. He will respond by returning the sign to you. Step 3 As you are seeing him with your astral vision, try and see every little detail. His beautifully colored robes, tools that he may be carrying, and the background that he may be approaching from. See him with your mind's eye, but most importantly, know with all your heart and feelings that you are in his presence. Step 4 When the visualization is as vivid as possible, let yourself go. Let go of your ego and your thoughts of whether or not you are doing it correctly, simply feel, open yourself up to him. While in this state, be aware of any thoughts or feelings that may come to you, absorb any message that he may be communicating to you. Step 5 Once you are ready to end the operation, be sure to thank Raphael for answering your questions. Be sure to end the communion by giving him the Theoricus Grade Sign. He will respond accordingly. Step 6 Finish the ritual with the Qabalistic Cross. Step 7 Be sure to perform the L.B.R.P..

The Eastern mystical school purports that there are ten principle nerves. These are tubes in the body. These ten nerves, or tubes as they are called, are responsible for the life force or the soul which is called Swara, the great controller of all who creates, preserves, and destroys and causes whatsoever in the world. Eastern tradition has it that there is no knowledge more precious than the knowledge of the Swara. In the Eastern tradition it is said that the Swara can destroy enemies and create power, wealth, and pleasures. All of these and more can be commanded by Swara. The Swara also exists in the body. In the Eastern school there are ten manifestations of Swara in the body. As stated, there are ten principle nerves or tubes in the body and it is through these that the Swara moves throughout the body. The ten manifestions of the Swara are called Vayus. Basically, what we are saying at this point in the Eastern system is that these ten forces will perform ten different functions in your physical body. For the student of the Qabalah, the Swara can be likened to the Ruach or the Ruach Elohim, Prana, or Kundalini. The Moon Breath deals with one of these ten nerve centers. It is called Ida, which deals with the left bronchus. The Moon Breath deals with the energy and the Vayus in regards to Ida. Keep in mind that these ten Vayus, or forces as we will call them, have their part in the ten principle nerves, not one in each. That is very important. Through the ten principle nerves the ten Vayus have a role to play, not one in each seperate nerve. These Vayus are the regulators of the physical body. They affect the astral and etheric body as well. If they are working in perfect harmony and function, then we can say the human being will be in perfect health. However, if they are not, then disease will spring up and we will have ill health. The key to understanding and making perfect integration possible of all these nerves lies in the working of Prana Vayu, or the vital principle of drawing the air through the Ida. Remember, Ida is the left bronchus. The Pingala is the right bronchus and the Sushumna is the middle bronchus or a combination of both. When air is drawn through the Ida, it is felt physically and visualized mentally as coming in the left nostril and also going out the left nostril. The Ida is also referred to as the Chandia Nadi or Moon nerve. The Pingala is referred to as the Sun nerve. When breathing through the Ida, the left nostril, the Moon nerve will give coolness and calmness to the body. When breathing through the Pingala, the Sun nerve, it will give heat to the body. The Ancients believed that the place of the Moon was in the Ida. Let us keep in mind what happens when molecules are cooled. When molecules are cooled, they slow their movement and they become more and more still. When the human body is cooled, the heart rate drops significantly. The breathing and respiration slow down. The adrenal glands slow down. The brain becomes more calm and still. These are all positive effects of the Moon breath. In other words, the Moon Breath will aid the Theoricus of The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in learning to focus his mind and calm his physical body and the sensations thereof and thus allow him to reach deeper states of consciousness and relaxation that will be important and vital in"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" 160 future workings, particularly in astral projection and the workings of skrying and traveling in the Spirit Vision, and of course in Adeptus Minor workings later. It is very important to practice the Moon Breath on a regular basis. Do not practice this breath sporadically, for by practicing it sporadically you will obtain little or no benefit. It must be practiced on a daily basis. One does not need to wipe out one's entire afternoon in the practice of the Moon Breath, but one does need to allocate at least three to five minutes a day in the beginning to get some kind of salutary effect from the practice of the Moon Breath. Therefore, it should be included along with other daily rituals. Preferably the Moon Breath should be performed before other rituals except for the L.B.R.P.. This will make your additional ritual and practice work much more effective than without the use of the Moon Breath. As the Theoricus of the Hermetic Order of The Golden Dawn practices the Moon Breath and builds up the required state, he should keep notes in his ritual diary as to the state he is achieving. Also, he should increase his time from three to five minutes a day to seven to ten minutes a day, and then from seven to ten minutes to twenty. Again, this should be done on a regular basis and should be done sitting up and with a good posture. The Theoricus should practice the Moon Breath while saying mentally the word Aum. Remember, the Moon Breath is through the left nostril only. The Theoricus should then meditate while mentally saying the word Aum and doing the Moon Breath during the waxing and waning crescents, while visualizing a full moon upon an indigo background. So your eyes should be completely shut while visualizing the silver crescent waxing and waning with your breath as you visualize it and mentally say the word Aum. After several minutes of this particular exercise the Theoricus should call before him the signs of the Air Triplicity: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius. After some moments of meditating on the Air Triplicities, he may also wish to meditate on the pentagram, the pentangle, or the hexagram. With continual practice of the Moon Breath and visualization of the airy triplicities, as well as the waxing and waning moon, you will begin to feel very light, very cool, and very still. Let the Theoricus then rise in imagination above the physical world, the world of mineral, into the world of trees, into the world of flowers, into the world of Air, and identify himself with universal and unconditional love for all creation. You should try to achieve sympathy with the elements behind these. Here the Theoricus will begin to unfold and realize the mental world, where mind now rules over matter. Let him have his mind perfectly clean and clear, allowing no thoughts other than the word Aum and the visualization to be in his mind. Through continual practice, the Theoricus will begin to learn to identify with appearance and reality, rather than prejudice and perceptions. In order for grade advancement, the Theoricus must not only demonstrate knowledge of the Moon Breath and how it is performed, but must achieve the sublime and subtle state required and necessary for advanced workings.

It deals with the astral light. It is the store-house of images. It is the cyclic energies underlying matter. We have the beams of energy of dsj and hrwbg both meeting in dwsy . Of course, the Queen scale of color for dsj is blue and for hrwbg it is scarlet. Thus, we have a deep violet purple or puce in dwsy . Also, the sphere of operation is that of Levanah, the Lunar beam. With the Lunar beam comes flux and reflux, change, increase and decrease. In dwsy , the Divine name is Shaddai El Chai, the Archangel is Gabriel, the Prince of Change and Alterations, and the Choir of Angels is the Ashim, the Fiery Ones. This relates to the fact that we find dwsy to be the area related to the Nephesch and the Ruach Elohim. We find very specialized energies in dwsy , directly underlying the material world. These energies can be manipulated in various forms and in many ways, through meditation and other practices in what we call magic. As the Emerald Tablets states, \"The things that are above are a reflection of the things that are below.\" So, as we create in the astral of dwsy we manifest in the physical of twklm . We refer to these currents of energy as astral light or Akashic fluid. Because dwsy is so close to the physical presence of twklm , all of us on this Earth from time to time feel the presence of astral light, though many of us dismiss it. This astral light may be felt as an overall tingling sensation, or as a pervasive warmth that seems to cover the entire body. Many times this results from heavy, prolonged prayer, or even from sexual stimulation. Mystics, of course, know that this feeling or this astral light can be intensified and actually moved to various parts of the body at will. This force oftentimes as stated is very sexual. If we look at where dwsy fits on the physical body, it fits over the reproductive organs of the body. Mystics have often said, in general terms, that God is sex. The records of the static union with God by various mystics at different times in history point to this revelation. When this astral light of dwsy , the sexual forces, are directly and consciously circulated throughout the body as in the Qabalistic ritual of the Middle Pillar, we find that the effects can many times be dizzying and overwhelming. It is not uncommon for beginners to literally pass out from this energy. Each of us has an astral body, or etheric body, which leaves the physical body generally during sleep or long unconscious periods. This can consciously be projected very specifically and at will by the Adept. This body is formed of astral light. The energy of this astral light in the East is called Kundalini, often referred to as the serpent. It is called by Qabalists the coiled serpent in dwsy . One particular and perhaps interesting aspect of the simple symbolism of the serpent is that it moves by undulation. This is very similar to the astral light that seems to move and weave itself back and forth. Of course, this pulsation or expansion of astral light and then decrease of astral light as through undulation can be directly attributed to the Moon's influence over it. That is why the planet of the Moon is attributed to the sephira of dwsy . The ancients determined that the Moon is in fact a planet and as it waxes and wanes it controls the motion of the tides and, of course, from the term Luna we have the word lunatic, which seems to be connected to strange behavior on a full Moon. So, on one hand we often conceptionalize the Moon as belonging to that of the insane, but, on the other hand, the Moon belonging to lovers, with midnight walks on a dark beach, under a starry night and"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"167 a full Moon. The Moon is both the Wiccan goddess Hecate in her Darkness, and Diana the Moon goddess in her brightness. Both hnyb and dwsy suggest some kind of control over waters. However, all the sephiroth of the Middle Pillar are the element of Air. It is Air that moves the Water. hnyb is the Great Sea and Isis Mighty Mother. So hnyb is the universal unconsciousness and it is from hnyb that all forms ultimately develop. We could say that hnyb is the will to form. However, dwsy is more of a storehouse of formal images, images that have been formed and lie directly behind our conscious experience. So, at the lowest level, dwsy is the astral world and the realm of images. It contains kind of an astral record which is both a combination of the history of the races and a kind of individual mental thought of each man. The images then that we find in dwsy are exciting, beautiful and fabulous. They are extremely seductive. However, they can also be hideous and frightening. In essence they are the dreams, longings and fears of humanity. They have existed since the beginning of time. dwsy is a great, huge body of water on which every little thought that has existed in mankind floats. dwsy is elusive and the astral plane has a warning to all who seek to improve their astral ability; it seeks to deceive . Let us remember that the Moon itself has no light of its own. It is a mere reflection of the Sun. dwsy can only reflect the light of Christ, Osiris, Buddha, center of trapt , the Logos, the Light of the world. This reflection of light found in dwsy is of great importance, especially for the developing magician in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , for at this stage of development we cannot look directly into the Sun. The lower astral plane is also called Maya, or illusion. The powers that exist in the astral plane many times are excited to create false images for us and let us believe whatever amuses us. Through this giant storehouse of thought and images they will provide visions of the most absurd notions, while at the same time they will be inflating our egos. This is very dangerous and it is a common result of working in the astral plane on this level. A good and formal understanding of this cosmic tide, so to speak, under the influences of Levanah can confer power. You see, the true Adept really understands the motions of this astral light and how it fluxes and also how it deceives. They see behind the flux within their own life. They see behind the deception of their own thoughts. They move beyond the deception, beyond the fluctuation, and eventually find themselves standing in the pure glowing light of trapt . The symbols of dwsy are the sandals and perfumes, both relating to practical magic. Thus, we have the consecrated sandals worn by the one who stands within the mystic circle. It is in this mystic circle that we have a neutral ground, and if you will, holy ground or sacred ground. Thus, we need consecrated sandals to walk on it, and that is the energy of the Earth below and the Sun above. dwsy then is the intermediary between twklm below and trapt above, kind of a two-sided mirror. Perfumes would suggest that it has etheric qualities. We know that incense floats through the air of the Holy Temple and subtly affects the minds of all who participate, for by images are all powers awakened and reawakened. The perfumes, incenses and scents are fleeting and illusionary which is, in fact, the nature of dwsy . The nines of the Tarot cards are"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"168 attributed to dwsy and should be looked at by the Theoricus at least briefly. Of course, more information will be given on that in a future grade. Some additional correspondences for the sephira of dwsy . The translation as stated earlier is foundation, the queen scale of color is violet, the Archangel is Gabriel. It deals directly with the Nephesch, which is the producer of the Ruach Elohim. Nephesch translates into lower self. One of the scents that might be burnt or utilized while you are meditating and working on establishing contact in dwsy is the scent of jasmine. The chakra is the root chakra which is actually the base of the spine. The body part is the genitals. The metal is silver. The stone is quartz. So, in pathworking dwsy we will probably want a lot of quartz-types of images, perhaps an altar of quartz or even a temple of quartz. The creature is the elephant. It is interesting to note that in my personal temple there are two elephants that stand on either side of the temple to the entrance, that the pillars on the side of the altar are erected from elephants, and that any exploring I do is with a guide, that has been well tested, usually on the back of an elephant. It is also interesting to note that these symbols were utilized by me in my own pathworking of dwsy long before I knew that the elephant was the animal. The tools as mentioned earlier are perfumes or scent, and sandals. The plant is comfrey. I will strictly warn you utilizing whatever fear tactics are necessary, that dwsy is the sephira of the astral light as pointed out earlier, kind of a collective storehouse of images, and as such it seeks to deceive the aspirant as well as to help enlighten. I would seriously advise all students of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn to exercise strong banishing after working any energy in dwsy , and to keep a very close diary of all revelations and inspirations that come from dwsy . Remember to test all things for Light using the Banner of the East, the Banner of the West, the pentagram, and of course the Divine name Shaddai El Chai. Do not immediately come out of dwsy and embark on a whole new lifestyle after doing so. Any change within consiousness or lifestyle should be done only after an extended period of thought and extended trips into dwsy . Everything should be tested thoroughly. One of the dangers is that people will work dwsy once or twice and immediately change their name, their hair color, their identity, and everything else because they are working from some kind of astral inspiration.

It is very important that we not be misled nor deceived in our journey toward the Great Work. The creation of the Body of Light, skrying, and astral travel require much skill, much discipline and much practice. It is for this reason that the magician always invokes the highest Divine names possible for the plane of existence he wishes to travel. Thus, he does so under the auspices of the Divine and not under the direction of his own ego. It cannot be emphasized too strongly the need of the skill of the creation of the Body of Light. Even in Tarot divination it will be found that the use of clairvoyance in determining what a particular card represents is really done with the inner eye, the eyes of the Body of Light. This is different from the ego eyes or eyes of Assiah of the physical body. In addition to this, later in the Adeptus Minor grade, there are a series of workings dealing with the Enochian system. As prerequisites one must be competent with astral work and the Body of Light in order to gain anything out of that system worth relating. One of the problems that may be confronted on a frequent basis are two misconceptions regarding clairvoyance, particularly referring to traveling in the Tattwas and skrying in the Spirit Vision. These two concepts that we confront can be both damaging and misleading to the novice. The first is the fear of clairvoyance, and this fear is based on an attitude that arises from a misunderstanding of its true nature. Many times it is said that the power of clairvoyance is obtained second hand from some source demonic or negative in nature. Many will claim also that the concept of using the techniques dealing with traveling and working with the Spirit Vision and the Body of Light will somehow come under evil influence. On the other hand, people imagine that somehow the power of clairvoyance is astronomical in that it will ease one's life and remove any trouble dealing with their lives, indicating there is an easier path accompanying the guidance that they desire. In fact, it may at times be considered that riches and prosperity may be obtained by will. This also is as far from the truth as can be imagined. The properly trained and skilled Adept clairvoyant and master astral traveler has no fear that he will expose himself to negative powers. He is not deluded into accepting the fact that everything he does and sees in the Spirit Vision is of some great significance that will change his life. It is the untrained natural clairvoyant that is a danger, not only to his own self, but to those around him. These natural clairvoyants are considered dangerous inasmuch that they open portals to energies far beyond their limits of control. These energies may come in forms that may be seemingly positive changes in one's life or positive growth, where in fact it is nothing more than a stumbling block that will not only affect them in years to come, but also affect those surrounding them. It is only after being exposed to the proper methods that one can truly be initiated to the occult powers beyond the physical. Let us realize that nobody has the inherent right to gain knowledge to which he has no claim. Let it be re-emphasized that the student of clairvoyance, astral travel and traveling in the Spirit Vision can only gain the skills necessary through hard work and discipline, as well as the power and skill to perform such tasks in security. Those attempting to gratify curiosity will be either very disappointed, distressed, finding"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"171 physical changes in their lives beyond their control or, simply and lastly, be mortified. Trained, humble, secure, honest and reverent astral workers and clairvoyants are a great gift. It is this same gift that is encouraged and developed that all have and possess, but only by skill, practice, and step-by-step training will one develop. The latter cannot be overemphasized as to its importance, for it is an issue within itself that many have paid the price in the attempt of such hit and miss occult science and haphazard book reading. There are many misconceptions dealing with the progress of such concepts. Many of which, in essence, never really reach their true goal but rather find that one is merely opening a portal to any general energy of any nature. It will be noted that this is not in accordance with the regulations of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn mode of operation and it is advisable that one should not consider adopting such a method. Follow directions and the training, adhere to the lessons at the grade standing and in the end you will prosper as a master astral worker and clairvoyant. Primarily, there are three general attributes and methods that fall under this lesson. However, we will be concentrating primarily on one of those developmental skills. They are: 1) Clairvoyance (Descrying in the Spirit Vision) 2) Astral Projection (Traveling in the Spirit Vision) 3) Rising in the Planes This lesson will cover traveling in the Spirit Vision whereby it will affect clairvoyance and rising in the planes indirectly in conjunction with the development of the Body of Light. Let it be emphasized that there is a significant difference between what is often called the \"Inner guide method meditation\" and \"Traveling in the Spirit Vision.\" The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn system, in accordance with the traditions, holds that one should always invoke the highest Divine name with every working. Thus, the work to be employed will be under the auspices and direction of that particular energy. With this, let it be understood that it is quite different from merely looking within or opening one's own self. There are also methods that employ the use of the proper sigils (symbols) such as the Tattwas and the Tarot cards to travel in the Spirit Vision and for astral work into other planes of existence. However, in this lesson the method of the Body of Light shall be covered in a step by step fashion. Exercises and Development Let us now move on to a part of the exercise dealing with the creation and development of the Body of Light. Begin gazing at one of your hands, noting all of its sides and all its details, the way it moves, the wrinkles around the knuckles, the hairs etc.. Then begin bending all the fingers separately beginning with the thumb, then the pointer, the middle, etc.. Attempt to feel the sensation you receive by bending them; notice and try to understand it. After doing this, do the reverse starting from the little finger, then the ring finger, the"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"172 middle, etc., keeping in mind to be aware of the sensation. The Theoricus should be performing this exercise each day. Move on now to the opposite hand and do the exact same procedure. After the exercise has been performed and an understanding of the sensations have been achieved do the same with the feet, then move on to the legs, noticing every detail to the best of your ability, and move throughout the trunk of the body. It would be advisable to be seated so that all the manipulative movements may be made. What this entire step is leading to is simply becoming aware of all body movements and sensory functions. Lastly move on to any part not yet covered and do the same procedure. After an understanding of the movements and details has been achieved, return to the region of the head and invoke the Divine name Eheieh through the crown. (An optional procedure may be consulted, which is the use of a mirror to allow the awareness of the body to hold vividly within your mind as the Divine energies are being invoked, moving every inch of the head and feeling and observing the sensation of all parts of the head as the white brilliance moves within.) Move now toward the region of the neck invoking the Divine name YHVH Elohim while shifting the neck from side to side and in any and every movement possible. Still being aware simultaneously with the energy of Eheieh, attempt to notice the intermingling of the energies with YHVH Elohim and be aware of the sensations physically. This is to say then that jumping back and forth from one region and returning to the previous region is acceptable. Although the energy is a constant flow moving toward the feet, its primary purpose is to aid in the awareness of the physical body intermingled with Divine energy. Move onward to the region of the solar plexus doing the same, vibrating the Divine name while noticing the physical regions that the energy affects. For example, the solar plexus, the chest, the forearms, part of the upper arms, and the region slightly above the naval. Continue with the exercise moving towards the region of the groin, which affects the buttocks, the thighs and the pubic area; then to the feet affecting the lower and upper legs, the ham strings, etc., once again observing all of the parts that are affected by the Divine spheres in its own region. There can be noticed a sure difference between simply observing the body without the invocation and observing the body with the invocation. All in all, the first step involves merely observing the body in its functions, where the second step involves the same observation, but with the energies that govern the regions of the body. Both of these exercises are done fully aware with the eyes open or closed, preferably sitting, not laying down. These next exercises are similar to the ones previously mentioned, however, these will be performed with your eyes closed. Begin again with one of the hands and eyes closed and, again, being observant. After doing this, attempt to observe the inner hand, the same hand, but of a lesser density (the astral Body of Light). Do the same to all the parts of the body much in the same order done previously, while still being aware of the energies invoked within your being, and keeping track not of the physical movements and functions, but instead keeping the body completely still while formulating a second or duplicate of each body part and observing its movements and functions. The next set of exercises involves the use of the sephiroth. Beginning with the crown and working down to the feet, twklm , using the vibrations and the Divine names in repetitions of twenty-five to thirty times in number, slowly and quietly observe your"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"173 Body of Light, doing nothing else but observing. This exercise should again be practiced over a period of time until such vision of the Body of Light can be seen and felt clearly without any trouble whatsoever. The next set of exercises is a little more interesting to perform, however, the first set must not be underestimated as to skip their performance. In this step you will sit up in a chair or lay flat on the floor. Concentrate on beginning with one of the hands. As you would normally move the right hand upwards while bending the fingers and observing the astral or physical body, here, with eyes closed, you will have the astral hand come from the immobilized physical hand, merely having the Body of Light rise out of the physical body. It will seem and feel similar to the previous exercises, except the physical will remain stationary as the Body of Light is the vehicle being moved. Beginning with one hand, perform the previous exercise moving all the fingers from the thumb to the little finger and then from the little finger to the thumb. Perform the regular exercise moving from the legs in the usual fashion toward the head, keeping in mind that you are now dealing with the Body of Light, not the physical body. After accomplishing this, merely will the Body of Light to return to its physical counterpart and merge. Observe now the difference with the invoked energies in the body from the Body of Light looking upon the physical body. Remember that whenever the exercise is done physically in a certain manner, the sequence must also be replicated as closely as possible within the Body of Light. In astral projection and the creation of the Body of Light, the astral worker emits from his ego a perceptible ray of identity and, by a trained eye, will send it to travel to the place desired. He then focuses it there, he concentrates, sees and knows that it is there not by mere reflection. Then, at the appropriate time, he re-enters his body. In traveling with the Spirit Vision, the process may be caused to start by using an appropriate symbol like the Tattwas, or it may be done on will alone. It is preferred for specified working that the Body of Light be created and focused through the Tattwa plane insofar that the travel will be focused and well defined when employing this agent. In this grade, memorization of all of the Divine names should have already been established. As progression leads on to astral workings and traveling in the Spirit Vision through the creation of the Body of Light, it is critical that the Divine names be memorized prior to the workings. In addition, prior to working the Tattwas, the exercises in this lesson should be mastered. Let it be emphasized that without the proper skills and knowledge, one may be walking a very thin thread of danger psychically, physically and emotionally. This is why it is imperative to adhere closely to the organized fashion of the lessons, to aid in preparation and development. This may be considered one of the many reasons why it is discouraging to hear from one not initiated into the instructions of this lesson that a conversation with one's spirit guide has been obtained when, in fact, it is of a lower energy manifesting to disguise as a spirit contact. Keep in mind that everyone may have more than one spirit guide, but there can only be one Higher Nature. Moreover, it may be considered that the spirit guides are aspects of our Higher Genius. Remember, always test! Up until this point we have consulted various exercises beginning with the understanding of the movement of the physical body to seeing the astral Body of Light around the physical, to working and separating portions of both the astral and the physical body. Now is the time to take the procedures a step further. At this point the"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"174 Theoricus should have taken a ritual bath. It is always advisable to purify the water and add a few drops of essential oil. He should be robed, in a ritual working area free of any disturbances. All the preliminary purifications and banishings should be employed in the working area, along with any incense or ritual items being used. Continuing with the exercise, begin with the relaxation ritual and meditative breath. After so doing say this invocation: \" In the name of the Lord of the Universe who works in silence and whom not but silence can express, I adore Thee and I invoke Thee. Fill me now with your Divine essence of Light, guiding me in my occult work for the greater glory of Thy name not mine. In the name of Eheieh (visualize the rtk sphere). In the Divine name of YHVH Elohim (visualize the sphere around the neck). In the name of YHVH Eloah Vedaath (visualize the sphere around the solar plexus). In the name of Shaddai El Chai (visualize the sphere), and in the name of Adonai ha-Aretz (encompassing the feet). Help me now so that all that I do and all that I see and all that I am is in accordance with my True Will, my Higher Genius and the Great Work. As it is desired, so shall it be!\" Let the Theoricus now visualize his own figure in all its details. Let him see it clearly as if his eyes were open. It should be enveloping or standing near or in front of his physical body. Focus on all aspects of the astral body and then slowly transfer the seed of consciousness from the physical into the visualized figure. All aspects of consciousness should be transferred to the astral Body of Light. He should then concentrate on the sensations of this astral vehicle; hearing, seeing, smelling and even touching. Again, the exercises above should all be performed in the astral Light in the same form that it was performed in the physical. Seeing that all the consciousness and mind are now present within the astral, let it now rise high above. At a point where it is felt high enough, he should stop and look about him. He should only notice and observe and not participate. If at any time any problems should arise psychically or by any foreign energy he should form a pentagram before him and banish that energy with the Divine name, \"YHVH, I banish thee. Be thou gone. As it is desired, so shall it be.\" It is not uncommon to see or feel energy sources approaching. He should be fully conscious of all the landscape and surroundings encompassing him. He may come into contact with figures that are approaching, being certain that he is armed with the authority to test using the appropriate Divine names, pentagrams and signs. If at times there may occur extreme difficulty, he should consult the use of the Banner of the West. A diagram is found in the lesson \"Establishing a Temple in twklm .\" Let it be noted that all figures must be tested for Light, \"Love, Truth and Knowledge,\" by use of the pentagram. You may use a few or all of these. Should the figure(s) withstand the power of the test, he can choose to travel with these figures if desired. Later, in advanced lessons, the Theoricus will learn to travel to specific planes particularly used in Tattwa vision. This information may now be incorporated into pathworking, beginning again with twklm . The Theoricus must also be aware of all the thousand subtle attacks and deceptions that he will experience. He must test the truth with all to whom he speaks and comes into contact. At this particular point in time, the Theoricus must be able to employ full consciousness with the Body of Light so that all aspects of his seed"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"175 of consciousness are fully inside his astral Body of Light. He must develop his astral double with integrity and practice the movement exercises before moving on. If for any reason it is felt that an energy is following you back to the physical body, you may consult the power of the L.B.R.P. and the B.R.H.. After the travel has been completed, allow the astral form to merge with the physical body. When the body has been completely reabsorbed, he should, with his astral eyes, be looking at the astral body. Once again, perform briefly the movement exercises. This time around be sure to observe the color of the astral body which may be white with highlights of off-blue. If there are any unusual differences in the astral body inside of the physical, he should now perform physically the L.B.R.P., B.R.H.. If there is a lack of strength or a feeling of weakness, a Middle Pillar will alleviate the problem.
