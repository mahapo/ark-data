blank"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Preface Dear reader Before you is a compilation of lectures held at the University of Bonn all revolving around interstellar dust and the formation of stars. From lecture notes to print The incentive to turn my scribbled lecture notes into a book was twofold: the desire to reach a larger audience, and the wish to hand students a more polished and lasting description of the tools for future work. Lecture and written text, even when covering the same topic, should not be identical in their contents, but complementary: they are two independent didactical challenges. In a lecture, the student should be able to follow from beginning to end. The speaker stresses ideas and concepts and does not waste time in elaborating lengthy formulae. A good lecturer may be likened to a salesman at the front door. He is aggressive, his arguments are compelling and what he says sounds exciting which prevents us from slamming the door in his face. A serious writer, however, can convince only by more subtle tones, most of all through thoroughness. He is like the unobtrusive shopkeeper whom we have been visiting for years. We know we can trust his goods, although he himself may be a bit boring. Whereas an opinion about a lecture is formed quickly and is not likely to change afterwards, we esteem a book only at second sight. Not every chapter has to be grasped at first reading. Instead, there is opportunity to contemplate a figure, formula or paragraph at leisure, over a steaming pot of tea or the curly smoke rings of a pipe. The topic The central theme of this book is cosmic dust. Its relevance for astronomy and for the evolution of the cosmos is not obvious. Unless we use special equipment, more sophisticated than binoculars, it does not catch our attention as does a variable star, a comet or a globular cluster. Dust only screens the light at optical wavelengths. Its constituents, the grains, are disappointingly small and would XiX"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xx Preface barely be visible under a microscope. The total dust mass in the Milky Way is negligible compared to that of the stars or even the interstellar gas. However, we believe that man is made of this very dust and that, by itself, is reason to study it in depth. But there is more to it. Interstellar dust is not an isolated component of the universe, like pulsars or white dwarfs, which could be removed and everything else would stay the same. Instead, it is in intimate contact with the rest of the world, giving and taking, and this is best exemplified by the influence it has on star formation and on the appearance of young stars and galaxies. The addressee This text was conceived for students who have received an elementary but comprehensive introduction to physics-this is usually the case after two years of university studies-and who have taken a general course in astronomy. It is also aimed at PhD students who are starting research and have come across interstellar dust in one of its many manifestations. Hopefully, this book will also be of service to astronomers in general. I admit that it contains hardly any exciting new results; not because a book is never fresh, nor for fear that excitement might be detrimental to the heart. Instead, the goal was to supply the student with those basic facts about small solid particles that passed the test of time. Only being acquainted with the old results can one fully enjoy the new. As many of the basic facts are scattered over the literature and are sometimes hard to dig up, a selected compilation was thought to be useful. Another reason to concentrate on matters where there is consensus and to avoid being specific or touching upon controversial topics lies in the very nature of the dust itself. Hardly any two dust grains in the universe are alike and this immense diversity explains, to a large degree, why all numbers about interstellar dust are vague and insecure. When an astronomical number is certain, say, the mass of a planet or the distance to a star, one can happily apply it in further work without worrying how it was derived. But when the number is ill determined, one should know the physical and technical pillars upon which its derivation rests. Only then can one estimate how far it may, or should, be stretched, or come up with a new number, physically founded and adapted to the particular problem. Astronomy is a branch of physics This is a provocative statement and may arouse indignation. As if I had forgotten how the great discoveries of the past 30 years have come about: As a result of revolutionary technologies and grand enterprises! Indeed, when one recalls how astronomical satellites have widened our outlook on the universe, it seems justified to consider astronomy a branch of Space Project Management, and when one thinks of the progress achieved by new telescopes, astronomy appears as a subfield of Telescope Engineering or Receiver Development.

Even ADM (Advanced Data Manipulation) may be more important to astronomy than physics in view of the gigantic quantities of data that have to be crunched and transformed into convincing numbers and pictures. So I freely acknowledge the priority of management and technology over physics. If one were to reduce the physics in astronomy courses to a minimum (one cannot do entirely without it) and teach instead the fields mentioned earlier, astronomy would continue to thrive for a decade or two, if one includes Science Marketing, even for three. Despite all this, out of sheer pleasure for the subject, this book stresses the link between astronomy and physics. It attempts to summarize the major physical topics with direct application to interstellar grains and wishes to encourage students to try the physical approach to an astronomical problem, without polemizing against higher resolution or higher sensitivity. The language It is obviously English. The obvious needs no words but there are lamentable aspects about using the modern lingua franca. I consider it a trifle that no sentence came easy. Indeed, it did me good learning some more of a foreign language while composing the text. Nor do I mind that one suspects behind simple phrases a simple mind, this supposition may be true. A serious argument against writing in a tongue one has not fully mastered is that style and clarity are akin because improving the style usually means improving the thought, nothing else. After all, a textbook on physical sciences is not a railway timetable. A poignant style enhances the understanding, helps memorize and carries the reader over difficult stretches. Ach, in this respect, German would have been beneficial to the reader. More important still is the obligation to preserve and develop one's language as an inherited gift and an attribute of culture of no less import than the collection of national wines. As English has become so pervasive in our daily scientific work, we, the majority of astronomers, tend to forget technical terms in our mother tongue or do not update them and this has the deplorable consequence that we speak and write about our favourite subject clumsily in two languages: in English and in our own. But the strongest point in a plea to retain in science one's mother tongue in all its might, parallel to the lingua franca, is that each language imprints on the mind its own pattern of thinking. Pondering a problem in different languages means approaching it on different paths, and each path offers its specific outlook. It is erroneous to think that the findings of natural sciences are fully expressed in numbers or formulae. Words are needed, too. A formula lacks cross relations and does not sufficiently take into account the analogous character of what it asserts. For example, I solve equations containing time but do not very well know what time is. If words are needed to explain a formula, how many more are required to arrive at it? What would quantum mechanics be if it were reduced to equations"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"XXll Preface without extensive accompanying text? Who would shorten R Feynman's Lectures on Physics? They are the work of a genius not because of the formulae, they are the usual ones but because of the way the story is told.

To whom I am indebted lowe to my colleagues who bore with me, helped with their expertise and advice and encouraged me, in particular: David Graham, Michaela Kraus, Antonella Natta, Richard Porcas, Johannes Schmid-Burgk and Alexandr Tutukov. I am grateful to those who undertook the pains of critically reading parts of the manuscript: Christian Henkel, Aigen Li, Armin Kiifel, Ralf Siebenmorgen, Werner Tscharnuter, Nikolaj Voshchinnikov, Malcolm Walmsley and Jan Martin Winters. Two books served as guides (Vorbilder) which I tried to follow, without pretending to match them. Each has, to my mind, one outstanding merit: L Spitzer's Diffuse Matter in Space is of dazzling perfection. It has been on my desk for decades (and I am still struggling with parts of it today). M Harwit pioneered in his Astrophysical Concepts to teach astronomy anew, with the eyes of a physicist, addressing the student and enlightening the professor. The philosophical headline A long scientific text is frequently preceded, one might even say embellished, by words from an authority outside the field, such as a philosopher or a poet. Although far from being an expert in the scientific subject itself, his words carry weight because they shed light on the topic from a different angle of cognition and reassure the natural scientist in his moments of doubt. I wish to follow this custom. Dabbling in poetry and philosophical treatises, I found numerous aphorisms suitable for such a purpose but the most appropriate headlines for this book came to me as a birthday gift from my daughters. It is the following verse by the 19th century North-American poet Walt Whitman which they had calligraphically written onto cardboard. Here is what Whitman left us: When I heard the learn' d astronomer, When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me, When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them, When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room, How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, Till rising and gliding out I wandered off by myself"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Preface XXlll In the mystical moist night-air, andfrom time to time, Looked up in peifect silence at the stars.

I will not admire how irresistibly Whitman conjures the lure of the night sky and contrasts it to the unnerving ambition of scholars. Nor will I marvel at his prophetic power to foresee and congenially describe the feelings of a backbencher at an astronomical meeting more than a century after his time. The reason for picking this poem as the philosophical headline is that it pays a wise tribute to the irrational. Reflected or not, irrationality, like the mystical moist night-air, is at the root of any sincere endeavour, including the quest of an astronomer to understand the cosmos. Some colleagues strongly disagree and regard with contempt those who let themselves be charmed by such a poem. I take their objections very serious but find the occasional vehemence of their arguments soothing, corroborating, at least, that they are not moved by logic and astronomical data alone.

The fundamental quantity describing how an interstellar grain responds to an electromagnetic wave is the dielectric permeability which relates the polarization of matter to the applied field. We recall the basic equations of electrodynamics and outline how plane waves travel in an infinite non-conducting (dielectric) medium and in a plasma. We summarize the properties of harmonic oscillators, including the absorption, scattering and emission of light by individual dipoles. Approximating a solid body by an ensemble of such dipoles (identical harmonic oscillators), we learn how its dielectric permeability changes with frequency. This study is carried out for three scenarios: • a dielectric medium where the electron clouds oscillate about the atomic nuclei; • a dielectric medium where the charge distribution in the atomic dipoles is fixed but the dipoles themselves may rotate; and • a metal where the electrons are free. 1.1 Maxwell's equations At the root of all phenomena of classical electrodynamics, such as the interaction of light with interstellar dust, are Maxwell's formulae. They can be written in different ways and the symbols, their names and meaning are not universal, far from it. Before we exploit Maxwell's equations, we, therefore, first define the quantities which describe the electromagnetic field. 1.1.1 Electric field and magnetic induction A charge q traveling with velocity v in a fixed electric field E and a fixed magnetic field of flux density B experiences a force F = q [E + ~v x B]"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"(1.2) 2 The dielectric permeability called the Lorentz force; the cross x denotes the vector product. B is also called the magnetic induction. Equation (1.1) shows what happens mechanically to a charge in an electromagnetic field and we use it to define E and B. The force F has an electric part, qE, which pulls a positive charge in the direction of E, and a magnetic component, (q / c)v x B, working perpendicular to v and B. When the moving charges are electrons in an atom driven by an electromagnetic wave, their velocities are small. A typical value is the velocity of the electron in the ground state of the hydrogen atom for which classically v / c equals the fine structure constant e 2 I a=-:::::::-«1. ftc 137 Protons move still more slowly because of their greater inertia. For an electromagnetic wave in vacuum, lEI = IBI and, therefore, the term (v x B)/c in formula (1.1) is much smaller than E and usually irrelevant for the motion of the charge. 1.1.2 Electric polarization of the medium 1.1.2.1 Dielectric permeability and electric susceptibility In an electrically neutral medium, the integral of the local charge density p(x) at locus x over any volume V vanishes, Iv p(x)dV = O. However, a neutral body of volume V may have a dipole moment p (small letter) given by p = Iv xp(x) dV. The dipole moment per unit volume is called the polarization P (capital letter), P= ~. V (1.3) It may be interpreted as the number density N of molecules multiplied by the average electric dipole moment Pmo! per molecule: P = Npmo!. E and P being defined, we introduce as an additional quantity the displacement D. It adds nothing new and is just another way of expressing the polarization of matter, P, through an electric field E: D = E+47TP. (1.4)"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Maxwell's equations 3 The local polarization P and the local average electric field E in the dielectric medium are much weaker than the fields on the atomic level and constitute just a small perturbation. Therefore, P, D and E are proportional to each other and we can write with D=sE P=XE (1.5) (1.6) s - I X = --. (1.7) 47T The proportionality factors s and X are material constants, they mean more or less the same; s is called the dielectric permeability or dielectric constant or permittivity, X bears the name electric susceptibility. In the trivial case of a vacuum, the polarization P vanishes, E = D and s = I. In a dielectric medium, however, a constant field E induces a dipole moment so that s > I and P =!= o. We have, altogether, three quantities describing the electric field: D, E and P, although two would suffice. For example, we could replace D in all equations by sE. Equation (l.5) is the first of two constitutive relations complementing the set of Maxwell's formulae. 1.1.2.2 The electric polarizability Another quantity we will need is the electric polarizability £t e . If we place a small grain of volume V into a constant electric field E, it acquires a dipole moment p = £teVE. (1.8) Because of the dipole moment, the field in the vicinity of the grain becomes distorted. It no has longer the value E but some other value, say E e (e for external). As one recedes from the grain, E e approaches E asymptotically. There is also a field E i inside the grain. This differs from the constant outer field E. The relation between them is described in detail in section 3.4. The polarization P (capital letter) depends linearly both on E i (from (1.6)) and on E (from (1.8)), the proportionality factors being £t e and X, respectively, (1.9) In the general case, £t e and X are tensors, and the dipole moment and the fields do not have the same direction. 1.1.3 The dependence of the dielectric permeability on direction and frequency Unless specified otherwise, we always assume (on a macroscopic level with dimensions much greater than an atom) homogeneity so that the dielectric"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"4 The dielectric permeability permeability S does not depend on the position in the grain. The relation (1.5), D = sE, is linear, which means that s is independent of the field strength. However, it may depend on the direction of the fields because, on a microscopic level, a grain is made up of atoms and is thus not homogeneous. Equation (1.5) must then be generalized to The constant term DOi implies a frozen-in dipole moment even in the absence of an outer field. This happens only in special cases known as pyroelectricity; for mono-crystals with a cubic structure (see section 7.1), DOi is always zero. The tensor Sik is symmetric, Sik = Ski, and can always be brought into a diagonal form by the appropriate choice of coordinate system. It then has, at most, three independent components. If the three diagonal elements are equal, S reduces to a scalar and the grain is said to be isotropic. Crystals of the cubic system have this pleasant property but in interstellar grains we will also encounter anisotropy. It is an essential feature for a discussion of interstellar dust that S is a function of frequency: w = 27TV or, as one says, that S shows dispersion. The functional form of S (w) is called the dispersion relation and will be used extensively in what follows. So the term dielectric constant, which is the other frequently used name for S (w), is misleading when taken at its face value. In electrostatics, only one parameter is needed to specify the polarization and X or S are real. However, in an alternating field, one needs for each frequency w two independent numbers which, out of mathematical convenience, are written as one complex variable: X(w) = XI(W) + iX2(W) sew) = SI (w) + iS2(W). 1.1.4 The physical meaning of the electric susceptibility X (UO) (UI) We explain the physical meaning of X in the case of a harmonically and slowly varying field, E = Eoe- iwt . We use scalar notation for the moment and let Eo be real. The vector representing the complex field E then rotates in the complex plane clockwise, as depicted in figure 1.1. For a slowly varying field with small w, the susceptibility X is close to its static value: XI ::::: x(O) X2 ::::: X2(O) = O."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Maxwell's equations imaginary 5 real Figure 1.1. The electric field vector, E, in the medium is presented as a complex quantity of length E, which rotates at frequency UJ. It induces a complex polarization P in the material of length P. When damping is weak, P lags behind E by a small angle cp. The real part of the complex electric susceptibility is equal to the ratio of the radii of the two circles, Xl = PIE, whereas the imaginary part gives the phase lag, X2 = Xl cp. Only the real components of P and E have a physical meaning, the complex representation is for mathematical convenience. The static value Xl (0) is positive because the polarization must point in the direction of the electric field. Obviously the real part Xl determines the maximum polarization during one cycle via the relation P max ::::: Xl Eo. As the field changes, E and P are not in phase because the electrons always need a little while to adjust. The polarization P, therefore, lags behind by some time /';.t « (V-I corresponding to a small angle (1.l2) The interval /';.t must be positive for reasons of causality: sensible people squeal only after they have been pinched. Therefore, the imaginary part X2 is positive and determines, for a given Xl, the time lag. While adapting to the field, the electrons have to overcome internal friction, which implies dissipational losses. Some of the field energy is inevitably drained into the dielectric medium. If X2 and /';.t were negative, the field would draw energy from the dielectric body, decreasing its entropy which contradicts the second law of thermodynamics. Even X2 = 0 is impossible as it would mean that E and P are absolutely synchronous"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"6 The dielectric permeability and dissipation is completely absent. If the frequency w is not small but arbitrary, the angle w/';.t is also not necessarily small. Nevertheless, we can exclude X2 :s 0 for the same reasons as before. The real part of the susceptibility, Xl, however, may become zero as well as negative. The maximum of P is now given by P max = J X? + xi Eo. Of course, we could also choose a time dependence e iwt for the field and nothing would change. The sign of i is just a convention, although one that must be followed consistently. When E = Eoe iwt , the field rotates anti- clockwise in figure 1.1 and the susceptibility, instead of (1.10), would be X (w) = Xl (w) - i X2(W), again with positive X2. 1.1.5 Magnetic polarization of the medium In a macroscopic picture, a stationary motion of charges with density p and velocity v, corresponding to a current density J = pv, produces a magnetic moment m = ~ I(X x J) dV. (1.13) 2c When the integral extends over a unit volume, it is called the magnetization M, m M=-. V (1.14) For example, a charge q traveling with velocity v in a circular orbit of radius r constitutes a current I = qv/2nr. The magnetic moment of this moving charge is qvr AI m=-=- 2c c where A = nr 2 signifies the area of the loop. If A is small, the accompanying field is that of a dipole. Without the motion of the macroscopic charge, the magnetization of matter comes, in the classical picture, from the atomic currents (electron orbits). The magnetic moment per unit volume M may be interpreted as the number density N of molecules in the substance multiplied by the total magnetic moment mmol per molecule: M= Nmmol. The magnetic field H is defined by H=B-4nM. (1.15) Similar to the situation of the electric field, we could replace H by B in all equations and retain two field quantities, Band M, instead of three. We would prefer the pairs (E, P) and (B, M), because the electric field E, the magnetic flux density B as well as the polarizations P and M allow a direct physical interpretation; however, conventions urge us to drag D and H along."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Maxwell's equations 7 1.1.6 The magnetic susceptibility The second constitutive equation concerns the magnetic field H and the induction B. If the substance is not ferromagnetic, a linear relation holds as in (l.5): B = JLH. JL is the magnetic permeability and also generally complex, (l.l6) It also shows dispersion. In vacuo, B = H and JL = 1. For diamagnetic substances, JL is a little smaller than one, for paramagnetic substances a little bigger, JL is large only for ferromagnets. Similar to (1.7), we define the magnetic susceptibility by JL-l X = -- (l.l7) 47T so that M = XH. If there is any chance of confusion, one must explicitly write Xm or Xe for the magnetic or electric case. In analogy to (1.8), a constant outer magnetic field H induces in a small body of volume V a magnetic dipole moment m= VM=amVH (l.l8) where am is the magnetic polarizability and M the magnetization within the body. For interstellar grains, which are weakly magnetic substances with IJLI close to one, the magnetic induction and magnetic field are practically the same inside and outside, and X ::::: a. If B denotes the interstellar magnetic field and M the magnetization of the grain, one usually writes M = XB. 1.1.7 Dielectrics and metals We will be dealing with two kinds of substances for which Maxwell's equations are often formulated separately: • Dielectrics. These are insulators and no constant current can be sustained within them. Nevertheless, alternating currents produced by a time-variable electric field are possible. In these currents, the charges do not travel far from their equilibrium positions. • Metals. This is a synonym for conductors and, in this sense, they are the opposite of dielectrics. When a piece of metal is connected at its ends to the poles of a battery, a steady current flows under the influence of an electric field. When this piece of metal is placed in a static electric field, the charges accumulate at its surface and arrange themselves in such a way that the electric field inside vanishes and then there is no internal current. However, time-varying electric fields and currents are possible. In the interstellar medium, one finds both dielectric and metallic particles but the latter are probably far from being perfect conductors."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"8 The dielectric permeability 1.1.8 Free charges and polarization charges We are generally interested in the electromagnetic field averaged over regions containing many atoms. So we usually picture the grain material to be a continuous medium. However, sometimes we have to dive into the atomic world. On a scale of 1 A or less, the medium becomes structured. Atoms appear with positive nuclei and negative electrons spinning and moving in complicated orbits and the electric and magnetic fields, which are smooth on a macroscopic scale, have huge gradients. Consider a microscopic volume 8 V in some piece of matter. It contains protons and electrons and the net charge divided by 8 V gives the total local charge density Ptot. For an electrically neutral body, electrons and protons exactly cancel and Ptot integrated over the body is zero. Often Ptot is written as the sum of two terms: Ptot = Ppol + Pfree· (1.19) The first arises from polarization. In a dielectric medium, the electric field polarizes the atoms and thus produces aligned dipoles. If the polarization within the particle is uniform, Ppol is zero because the positive and negative charges of the neighboring dipoles exactly balance; the only exception is the surface of the particle where charges of one kind accumulate. However, if the polarization P is spatially non-uniform, ppol does not vanish. Then the separation of charges is inhomogeneous and leads to a charge density ppol = - div P. (1.20) The second term in (1.19), {>free, comprises all other charges besides ppol. For example, when the polarization is constant, div P = 0 and Pfree stands for all charges, positive and negative. In an uncharged body, their sum is zero. When charges are brought in from outside, {>free =!= O. Within a metal, P = 0, and polarization charges can only appear on the surface. Moving charges constitute a current. The total current density J tot may also be split into parts similarly to (1.19), J tot = Jfree + Jpol + Jmag. (1.21) The first term on the right-hand side is associated with the motion of the free charges, the second with the time-varying polarization of the medium and the third represents the current that gives rise to its magnetization: J free = V {>free Jpol = p Jmag = C . rotM. (1.22) 1.1.8.1 Sign conventions We have to make a remark about the sign convention. An electron, of course, has a negative charge, its absolute value being e = 4.803 x 10- 10 esu (electrostatic"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Maxwell's equations 9 units). After Maxwell's equation (1.27), the electric field of an isolated positive charge (proton) is directed away from it and repels other positive charges according to (1.1). The moment p of a dipole created by two opposite but equal charges is, from (1.2), directed from the minus to the plus charge and anti-parallel to the electric field along the line connecting the two charges. Hence a dielectric grain in a constant field E has a polarization P parallel to E and surface charges as depicted in figure 3.4 of chapter 3. With the help of this figure, we can explain the minus sign in equation (1.20). Going from left to right, the polarization jumps at the left edge of the grain from zero to its value inside. The gradient there is positive and thus a negative charge appears on the surface. In the case of non- uniform polarization within the grain, at a place where div P > 0, the electric field pulls a small charge 8q out of a tiny volume 8 V leaving behind an unbalanced negative charge -8q. 1.1.9 The field equations We have now defined all quantities that appear in Maxwell's equations and we write them down, first, for a neutral dielectric medium: divD = 0 divB = 0 I . rotE = --B c I . rotH = -D c second, for a medium with free charges and currents: div D = 47TPfree divB = 0 I . rotE = --B c I. 47T rotH = -D + -Jfree.

The flux, which is the energy per unit time and area, is given by the Poynting vector S. For real fields, its momentary value is c S = -E x H.

The wave also transports momentum, through a unit area at a rate Sic. In the corpuscular picture, an individual photon travels at the speed of light, has an energy h v, a momentum h v I c and an angular momentum n. 1.2.2 The wavenumber The vector k = (k x , k y , k z ) in (1.36) is called the wavenumber and is, in the most general case, complex: with real k 1, k2 and obeys the relation (1.41) Of course, k 2 = k . k = k; + k~ + k~.

This is strictly possible only in a vacuum. Any other medium is never fully transparent and an electromagnetic wave always suffers some losses. As k specifies the direction of wave propagation, it follows from (1.42) and (1.43) that the vectors of the electric and magnetic field are perpendicular to each other and to k.

If the vectors k 1 and k2 are parallel, the planes of constant phase and constant amplitude coincide. There is a unit vector e parallel to k defining the direction of wave propagation such that k = (kl + ik2) . e, where kl, k2 are the lengths of kl, k2. Such a wave is called homogeneous. If kl and k2 are not parallel, one speaks of an inhomogeneous wave and the surface where the field is constant is not a plane. The geometrical relations (1.42), (1.43) then lose their obvious interpretation. 1.2.3 The optical constant or refractive index For the propagation of light, the electromagnetic properties of matter may be described either by the wavevector (from (1.41)) or by the optical constant m =-JEii.

This formula follows readily from the potential energy between the charges, which is due to their Coulomb attraction. It suggests an energy density 1 u = -E·E. 87T If the space between the charges is filled with a dielectric, 1 u = -E· D. (1.53) 87T When we compare (1.52) with (1.53), we find that the energy density of the dielectric medium contains an extra term ~ EP which accounts for the work needed to produce in the medium a polarization P. Therefore, if we place, into a constant field in a vacuum, some small dielectric object of volume V, the total field energy changes by an amount (1.54) It becomes smaller because some work is expended on the polarization of the grain.

Because of the mathematical relation (A.33), the real part of the dielectric polarizability Re{a e } disappears in the product (PE) confirming that only the imaginary part Im{a e } is responsible for heating the grain. Formally similar expressions but based on different physics, hold for magnetism. We first look for the formula of the magnetic energy density. Whereas static electric fields are produced by fixed charges and the total energy of the electric field is found by bringing the charges to infinity (which determines their potential energy), static magnetic fields are produced by constant currents. These currents also exert a force F on a charge but from (1.1) do no work because F· v = (q/c)v· (v x B) = O. Therefore, in the case of a magnetic field, one has to evaluate its energy by changing H. This produces according to (1.25) an electric field E and thus a loss rate E . J. After some elementary vector analysis, one gets, for the total energy of the magnetostatic field, u = _1 !H.BdV 87T which implies an energy density of the magnetic field 1 u = -H·B. 87T (1.56) In complete analogy to the electric field, a time-variable magnetic field, H = Hoe-hut, leads in a small body of volume V and magnetic polarizability am (see (1.18)) to a heat dissipation rate (1.57) (l.55) and (l.57) are the basic equations for understanding the absorption of radiation by interstellar grains. 1.2.4.1 The symmetry a/the polarizability tensor We have already mentioned that, for an anisotropic substance, the dielectric permeability s is a tensor and symmetric.

Then one takes back the component Ex and finally the component E y . If the cycle is loss-free, the condition W = 0 requires ft xy = ft yx . In a similar way, one finds ft xz = ft zx and ft yz = ft zy . 1.3 The harmonic oscillator In the early history of atomic theory, H A Lorentz applied the harmonic oscillator model to the motion of an electron in an atom. Despite its simplicity and the fact that electrons 'move' in reality in complicated paths, the Lorentz model is quite successful in a quantitative description of many phenomena that occur on the atomic level and reveal themselves in the macroscopic world. The oscillator concept is very fruitful, although a precise idea of what we mean by it is often missing. Usually we have in mind the electrons in an atom but occasionally the oppositely charged atomic nuclei of a crystal or some other kind of dipoles are meant. But generally we assume that a grain is built up of a system of oscillators. Using this concept, we later derive the dispersion relation s = s(w) of the dielectric permeability around a resonance at frequency woo 1.3.1 The Lorentz model We imagine the following idealized situation: An electron of mass me and charge e is attached to a spring of force constant K. A harmonic wave with electric field E = Eoe- iw1 exerts a force F = eE which causes the electron to move, say, in the x-direction. Its motion is governed by the equation meX + bi + KX = F. (1.58) On the left-hand side, there is (a) an inertia term mex; (b) a frictional force, -bi, which is proportional to velocity and leads to damping of the system unless it is powered from outside; and (c) a restoring force, - K x, that grows linearly with the displacement from the equilibrium position. Putting 2 K wO=- me b y=- me we get .. . 2 eE x + yx + wax = -. me (1.59)"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"16 The dielectric permeability The oscillator has only three properties: • charge-to-mass ratio e / me, • damping constant y and • resonant frequency wo (if the electron is unbound, wo = 0). In the following, we discuss only the one-dimensional oscillator, where the electron moves along the x-axis but one may readily generalize this to three dimensions. It is assumed that the electric field is spatially constant over the displacement x of the electron. This is correct as long as the velocity v of the electron is small, v « c, because then x ::::: v / w can be neglected in comparison to the wavelength c/ w of the field. Indeed, the velocity of an electron in an atom is typically of order v / c '\" 1 %. 1.3.2 Free oscillations In the simplest case, when there is no friction (y = 0) and no perturbation from outside (E = 0), (1.59) reduces to .. 2 0 x + wax = (1.60) and the electron oscillates harmonically forever at its natural frequency wOo If there is friction (y =1= 0) but no external force, x + yx +w6x = 0 the solution is called a transient.

If y2 < 4w6, i.e. when damping is weak, w y is real. The electron then oscillates at a frequency w y somewhat smaller than the natural frequency wo, with an exponentially decaying amplitude. If friction is strong, y2 > 4w6 and w y is imaginary. The amplitude then subsides exponentially without any oscillations. Critical damping occurs for y = 2wo.

So if we assume an harmonic field, E and Eo are complex and x + yx + w6 i = ~Eoe-iwt. me (1.64) One obtains the general solution of this inhomogeneous equation by adding to the general solution (1.62) of the associated homogeneous equation (1.61) one particular solution of (1.64), for example - - -iwt X = xoe .

Without friction (y = 0), the electron and the field are synchronous. With friction, the complex variables for position and field, x and E, are out of phase because of the imaginary term iwy in (1.66). The electron always lags behind the field by a positive angle ifw < wo ifw> WO wy where x = 2 .

Then the electron moves opposite to the direction in which it is being pushed by the external force e E. This is not a miracle but reflects the steady-state response of the electron. Initially, when the field E was switched on, the acceleration vector of the electron pointed, of course, in the same direction as the electric field. 1.3.4 Dissipation of energy in a forced oscillation The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of kinetic energy T plus potential energy V: T + V = !me(X 2 + w6x2). (1.68) The total energy declines when there is friction. If we think of a grain as being composed of many oscillators (atoms), friction results from collisions of the electrons with the lattice and this leads to heating. The damping constant y, which has the dimension S-I, is then interpreted as the collisional frequency.

The inverse, w p 1 , gives the relaxation time of the electron density. To prove it, we apply a perturbation to a plasma in equilibrium which consists of heavy, immobile positive ions and unbound light electrons. Prior to the disturbance, the mean charge density p over any macroscopic volume ~ V is zero: positive and negative charges balance. Now consider in the plasma a slab Sl with sides ~x, ~y, ~z and ~y. ~z = I, so that the volume of the slab ~ V = ~x. All electrons inside S 1 are suddenly displaced along the x -axis by the infinitesimal length ~x. After this disturbance, they are in the neighboring slab S2, which has the same shape and volume as Sl, and the net charge density (ions plus electrons) in S2 is no longer zero but equal to Ne. The electric field E arising from the charge separation as a result of shifting electrons from Sl to S2 exerts a force F on the displaced electrons and accelerates them: F = Ne~x· E = N~xmex.

For light traveling from focus F 1 of an ellipse to focus F2 via the reflection point M on the circumference of the ellipse, the total path length F 1 MF2 is indifferent to variations around M. If the reflection point M lies on the tangent T, the actual path is a minimum, if it is on the curve C which has a curvature radius smaller than the ellipse at M, the path is a maximum. 1.4.1 Attenuation and refraction of light The attenuation of light is due to the dissipation of energy. In the harmonic oscillator model, the electrons transfer kinetic energy in collisions to the lattice. The loss rate depends foremost on the imaginary part of the dielectric constant 82, which itself is proportional to the frictional parameter y. In a resonance, 82 has its maximum value close to but not coinciding with the natural frequency evo (see figure 1.2). 82 or k can never be negative as this would imply amplification of light, which is impossible for a dust grain in thermodynamic equilibrium. In an idealized loss-free medium 82 and k vanish. The real part of the dielectric constant, 81, may take up positive and negative values. The real part of the optical constant, n, however, is always positive. The index n determines the phase velocity Vph of the wave. Without damping one finds, from (1.44) and (1.46), C Vph = -. n n is responsible for the phenomenon of refraction. According to Fermat's principle, light traveling in a medium of varying n chooses, from among all possible paths, the quickest. More precisely, when infinitesimally varying the actual path, to first order, the travel time does not change. So the chosen route might be a local minimum or a local maximum (see figure 1.3). Fermat's principle formally explains how spectacles and binoculars work and why a light ray changes its direction when it passes from a medium with index n 1 to one with n2. The physical reason that, for example, the phase velocity in glass is different from that in vacuum is contained in the concept of superposition which"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"24 The dielectric permeability states that the field at any given point is the sum of the fields from all oscillators anywhere in the world. Consider, for this purpose, a plane wave that encounters a flat, thin sheet of glass oriented perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. The electric field of the wave accelerates the electrons in the glass and they start to radiate themselves. The field E a far ahead of the sheet is, according to the principle of superposition, the sum of the fields created by all electrons plus the field of the incident wave. When one computes E a (it is not too difficult), one finds that it has a phase shift relative to the incident wave, i.e. to the wave if there were no sheet. One gets exactly the same phase shift if one neglects the fields from the electrons altogether and assumes the wave has traveled in the sheet at a reduced phase velocity cln. So the phase velocity cln follows, in a subtle way, from the interference of the incoming wave with waves generated by the excited oscillators. For a medium that is almost transparent, i.e. when the damping is weak and y «wo, the expression for n reduces, from (l.48) and (1.77), to (1.80) So for small attenuation, n is nearly constant at low frequencies and equal to I + w~/2w6. As one approaches the resonance (see figure 1.2), n rises, reaches its maximum shortward of wo, dips afterwards below one and goes asymptotically to unity at high frequencies. In terms of actual frequencies, it all depends, of course, on the value of woo When n rises with w, i.e. to the left of wo in figure 1.2, one speaks of normal dispersion. This is true, for example, for glass in the visible range: blue light entering a prism is bent more than red light. However, if dnldw < 0, the dispersion is called anomalous, for historical reasons. When n is less than one, the phase velocity exceeds the velocity of light in vacuum. This does not violate special relativity as it is not possible to transmit information with a monochromatic wave.

The medium is then a plasma and the dispersion relation is known as the Drude profile. We show that, in the presence of a magnetic field, the optical constant n of a plasma depends for circularly polarized plane waves on the sense of rotation. This leads"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Waves in a conducting medium 33 to the phenomenon of Faraday rotation. We also derive the group velocity of a wave package in a plasma. 1.5.1 The dielectric permeability of a conductor A conductor contains free charges that can support a constant current, as we know from everyday experience with electricity. Ohm's law asserts a proportionality between the electric field E and the current density J (omitting the suffix 'free'), J=aE. (UI2) a is called the conductivity and is usually defined for a quasi-stationary electric field; in a vacuum, a = O. When a conductor is placed in a static field, no current can flow because the charges arrange themselves on its surface in such a way that the electric field inside it cancels out. In a dielectric medium, however, a static electric field is, of course, possible. An electric field may exist in a metal, either because it varies rapidly and the charges do not have time to reach their equilibrium positions or it is produced by a changing magnetic field according to (1.25). We treat conductors because some interstellar grains have metallic properties and because the interstellar medium is a plasma. Let us start with the Maxwell equations (1.29) and (1.30) which are appropriate for conductors, I . rotE = --B c I. 47T rotH = -D + -J. c c (Ul3) (UI4) When we insert harmonic fields into these formulae, we get for a homogeneous medium with the help of (1.112) rotE = i WJL H c rotH = -i~ (8+i 4 : a )E. We may look at (1.113) as an expansion of rotH into powers of w. The term with the conductivity a dominates at low frequencies, more precisely when 47Ta 181«-· W Then equation (1.113) reduces to 47Ta rotH = --E c which describes the magnetic field produced by a quasi-stationary current.

At low frequencies, the dielectric permeability of a metal is approximately (see (U23) for an exact expression) 47TlY sew) = i--. w s is then purely imaginary (SI = 0), much greater than one (lsi» I) and has a singularity at w = O. From (1.48) and (1.49) the optical constants nand k are, therefore, also large and roughly equal: n:::::.k--+oo for w --+ O. (Ul7) The difference between dielectrics and metals vanishes when the electromagnetic field changes so rapidly that the electrons make elongations that are small compared to the atomic radius.

This happens around w:::::. 10 17 S-I. 1.5.2 Conductivity and the Drude profile We repeat the analysis of the harmonic oscillator in section 1.3 for a plasma. The electrons are then free, they experience no restoring force after an elongation and, therefore, wo = 0 in (1.59). With the same ansatz x = xoe- iw1 as before, we find the velocity of a free electron in an harmonic electric field: e v = E. me(Y - iw) The conductivity follows from the current density J = lYE = N ev.

It is then an essentially real quantity approaching the direct-current limit w 2 a(w = 0) = -p- 4ny (U20) which appears in Ohm's law. The conductivity depends on the density of free electrons through Wp and on the collision time through y. • If the frequency is high or damping weak (y « w), the conductivity is purely imaginary and inversely proportional to frequency. There is then no dissipation of energy in the current. When we put cd = 0, JL = I, and substitute, for the conductivity a, the expression from (1.118) into (1.116), we find for the wavenumber of a plasma (1.121) Without damping, k 2 = :: (I - :~) . (U22) In this case, when w is greater than the plasma frequency, the real part n of the optical constant is, from (l.48), smaller than one, so the phase velocity is greater than the velocity of light, Vph > c. For w = Wp, n becomes zero. A wave with w :s Wp cannot penetrate into the medium and is totally reflected. The bending of short-wavelength radio waves in the ionosphere or the reflection on metals (see (3.60)) are illustrations. The dielectric permeability c (w) corresponding to (1.121) is known as the Drude profile (see (1.41)): (U23) To get some feeling for the numbers associated with the conductivity, here are two examples: • Copper is a pure metal with a free electron density N ::::: 8 x 10 22 cm- 3 , a plasma frequency Wp = 1.6 x 10 16 S-1 and a damping constant y :::::"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"36 The dielectric permeability 3 X 10 13 S-I.

Graphite is a reasonable conductor only when the electrons move in the basal plane. 1.5.3 Electromagnetic waves in a plasma with a magnetic field In the presence of a magnetic field, wave propagation is generally complicated. We consider the fairly simple situation when a plane wave with electric vector E = (Ex, E y , 0) travels without attenuation through a plasma parallel to a constant magnetic field B = (0,0, B) oriented in the z-direction.

In this section, we consider molecules with an intrinsic dipole moment and a rigid charge distribution that are allowed to rotate. This process is principally relevant to gases and liquids and only marginally to solids, provided the molecules are sufficiently 'round' so that they can tum and are not hooked too strongly to their neighbors. However, the analysis which we develop here also applies to the alignment of atomic magnets and we will use the results later in chapter lIon grain alignment. 1.6.1 Polarization in a constant field An atom or molecule with a dipole moment p in an electric field E has a potential energy U that depends on orientation, U = - p . E = - pEcos e (1.l33) where e is the angle between the vectors p and E, their lengths being p and E. The potential energy is at its minimum when the dipole moment lines up with the field and e = O. The atoms are never perfectly aligned because they are tossed around by the motions of their neighbors. In thermal equilibrium at temperature T, the distribution of orientations is expressed by the Boltzmann factor e- u / kT . If fee) de denotes the number of atoms that have angles between e ... e + de, then fee) = foe- u / kT = foepEcos(I/kT.

An identical formula holds for magnetic dipoles (dipole moment m) in a magnetic field. One just has to replace pE by mB. 1.6.2 Polarization in a time-variable field The distribution function f for the orientation of dipoles in the case of a time- variable field is considerably more complicated. It now depends not only on the angle e between dipole moment and field but also on time, so we have to write fee, t) instead of fee). The time enters into f for two reasons. First, the field exerts on each dipole a torque T = pEsine (1.l39) which makes it rotate. The rotation speed e is assumed to be proportional to the torque T, so (1.l40) where i; is a friction coefficient. Second, there is Brownian motion because the dipoles are jostled about in collisions. We now sketch how one derives an expression for the distribution function leaving aside the mathematical details.

One computes the change in the number of dipoles I(e, t) dQ over the time intervalOt. The intervalOt is chosen long enough so that the dipole axes manage to escape from dQ but also sufficiently short so that their directions are modified only by a small angle. The change ~ is split into a contribution due to Brownian motion and one due to the field ~ = ~Brown + ~field. • To evaluate ~Brown, one can restrict the discussion to the dipoles in the vicinity of dQ, because Ot is small. This leads to an expression for ~Brown that depends on 1 and its spatial derivatives times the mean square angular distance (¢2) which the axis of an individual dipole travels during the time Ot. But (¢2) is known: for Brownian motion (¢2) = kT Ot /41;. • The other term ~field is much easier to calculate. The axes are turned at an angular velocity e by a variable torque r (see (1.140)) that tries to align the moments with the field.

It does of course not depend on time, so j vanishes. We may convince ourselves that (1.134) is, indeed, a solution to (1.141) for j =0. Suppose now that the field is suddenly switched off at time t = O. Then for t > 0, the torque r is absent and the orientations begin to randomize; after a while, complete disorder is established.

In sections 2.3 and 2.4, we learn how to compute the scattering and absorption coefficients of particles. The problem was first solved in the general case for spheres by G Mie [Mie08] and the underlying theory bears his name.

Again f = I for isotropic scattering and the normalization condition is 1= ! 1+ 1 f(x)dx. -I When one does not know or does not need the full information contained in f(cose), one sometimes uses just one number to characterize the scattering pattern.

In the limit of pure forward scattering, g = I; for pure backscattering g = -I. 2.1.2.2 The momentum imparted on a grain by radiation Electromagnetic radiation also exerts a pressure on a grain. A photon that is absorbed deposits its full momentum h v / c. If it is scattered at an angle e (see figure 2.1), the grain receives only the fraction (I - cos e). Therefore, the cross section for radiation pressure, Crp, can be written as Crp = C ext _ g . C sca . (2.7) As g can be negative, although this case is unusual, Crp may be greater than C ext .

The circularly polarized wave sets a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator in the (x, y)-plane (with equal properties in the x- and y-directions) into a circular motion; it transmits angular momentum. One can combine two linearly polarized waves to obtain circular polarization and two circularly polarized waves to obtain linear polarization. The magnetic field has the same polarization as the electric field because E and H are in phase and have a constant ratio. 2.4.4 Stokes parameters The polarization ellipse is completely determined by the length of its major and minor axes, a and b, plus some specification of its orientation in the (x, y)-plane. This could be the angle y between the major axis and the x-coordinate. Instead of these geometrical quantities (a, b, y), polarization is usually described by the Stokes parameters I, Q, U and V. They are equivalent to (a, b, y) but have the practical advantage that they can be measured directly. We omit the underlying simple mathematical relations as well as the description of the experimental setup. When a plane harmonic wave is scattered by a grain, the Stokes parameters of the incident (subscript i) and the scattered wave (subscript s) are linearly related through S12 S13 S22 S23 S32 S33 S42 S43 (2.69) The Stokes parameters of the scattered light as well as the matrix elements refer to a particular scattering direction (e, ¢); r is the distance from the particle. The matrix Sij contains no more information than the matrix in (2.58) and, therefore, only seven of its 16 elements are independent, which corresponds to the fact that the four elements Sj in the matrix of (2.58) have four absolute values ISj I and three phase differences between them."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"62 How to evaluate grain cross sections • Only three of the four Stokes parameters are independent as for fully polarized light (2.70) • Unpolarized light has Q=U=Y=O and for partially polarized light, one has, instead of the strict equality [2 = Q2 + U 2 + y 2 , an inequality [2 > Q2 + U2 + y2. • For unit intensity (I = I), linearly polarized light has so that y =0 Q = cos2y U = sin2y Q2 + U 2 = 1.

Their deduction is very abstract and the result baffling. The relations have some fundamental consequences, however, their practical value is, at present, moderate. 2.5.1 Mathematical formulation of the relations We have to digress briefly into the theory of complex functions. Let fez) = u(z) + iv(z) be a function of the complex variable z = x + iy.

(2.78) The fundamental theorem of complex functions states that if f (z) is regular in a region G, i.e. it is single-valued and has a derivative, then the integral over any closed path p in G vanishes: i f(z)dz = O. (2.79) For the function fez) we choose fez) = g(z) z -xo (2.80) where (2.81) for 0 --+ O. g(z) = gl (z) + ig2(Z) is also a complex function and xo a real and positive number. If fez) is regular in the upper half of the z-plane, the integral along the closed path p, which is depicted in figure 2.5, is zero according to (2.79). The path p runs along the x- axis from left to right, makes a small semicircle of radius 0 around xo, and returns in a big half-circle of radius R to the starting position; we have divided it into four segments PI to P4. Now assume that R is very big and that g(z) has the property to vanish for Iz I --+ 00; the integral along the big half-circle P4 then vanishes too. The small semicircle P2 may be parametrized by z(t) = xo - oe- it with 0 :s t :s n.

The path consists of four segments, PI to P4. The points in this plane are identified with complex frequencies UJ. Only the positive x-axis has a physical meaning but equation (2.88) allows us to define X for any complex argument UJ.

Likewise, we could use the dielectric permeability 8, with the small modification that we have to put gl = 81 - 1 and g2 = 82. We reiterate that, in the constitutive relation (1.6), P=X(w)E the polarization P depends linearly on the electric field E because E is so much weaker than the fields on the atomic level. In the most general case, the vector P at time t is not determined by the present value of E alone but by the whole preceding history. We, therefore, write the linear relation in the form pet) = 1 00 F(r)E(t - r)dr. (2.87) This equation specifies how P responds to the application of an electric field E. Besides linearity, formula (2.87) also expresses causality because pet) results from an integration over the past. The function F (r) depends on time and on the properties of the medium. It has values substantially different from zero only in the immediate past over an interval ~ r corresponding to the time scale for polarizing the molecules. At times much larger than ~ r, the function F (r) vanishes because the distant past does not influence the present. When we consider monochromatic electric fields, E(t) = Eoe- iw1 , the polarization P = XE has exactly the form of (2.87), if the dielectric permeability is given by X(w) = 1 00 e iwr F(r)dr. (2.88) Although only a real and positive frequency has a physical meaning, this equation formally extends X to any complex argument w of the upper half of figure 2.5; in the lower half where Im{ w} < 0, the integral (2.88) diverges. Such an extension is necessary to perform the integration in (2.79). We summarize here some of the properties of the electric susceptibility of (2.88): • If Iwl --+ 00, X goes to zero.

As a consequence, the susceptibility X of (2.88) has no singularities in the upper half of the complex w-plane and this is a necessary condition for obtaining the Kramers-Kronig relations (see (2.79)). • X fulfils the symmetry relations X(-w) = X*(w) X(-w*) = X*(w) for real w for complex w. (2.89) The last equation expresses the fact that a real field E produces a real polarization P. When, in (2.80), we replace g(z) by X(w), we may convince ourselves that X (w) has all the desired mathematical properties to obey the formulae (2.84)- (2.86), if wo is a real and positive frequency. 2.5.3 The Kramers-Kronig relation for the dielectric permeability Here is the final result formulated explicitly for the dielectric permeability. For an arbitrary medium, ci and c2 are not completely independent of each other but for any frequency wo, 2 tOO WC2(W) ci (wo) - 1 = - 2 2 dw now - W o 2wo tOO ci (w) C2(WO) = - - 2 dw. n 0 w 2 - W o For the static limit of ci at zero frequency, (2.90) (2.91) (2.92) 21 00 C2(W) CI(O) - 1 = - -- dw. now Similar relations hold for the electric susceptibility x, the electric polarizability £t e or the optical constant m = n + ik. Whenever the vacuum value of the material constant is one (as for c), the -1 appears on the left-hand side (see (2.90) and (2.92)), when the vacuum value is zero (as for X), the -1 is missing. 2.5.4 Extension to metals In a metallic medium, the conductivity a of (1.119) also follows the Kramers- Kronig (KK) relations.

To speak of a magnetic susceptibility Xm makes sense only if, neglecting free charges, in the expression (1.21) for the total current density J tot the magnetic current dominates over the polarization current: Jmag = c rotM » Jpol = P.

They thus serve as a check for the internal consistency of data measured, for example, in the laboratory or derived otherwise. It is even sufficient to know one of them over the entire wavelength range, either 8 I (w) or 82 (w), to compute the other. Whereas 8 I (w) is not restricted at all, 82 (w) is associated with the entropy and must be positive everywhere. A data set for 8 I (w) is wrong if it yields at just one frequency a negative value for 82 (w). As an example of a dispersion formula that obeys the KK relations we may take equation (1.77) or (1.121). They apply to the harmonic oscillator or a metal, respectively. That they fulfil the KK relations may be verified from general mathematical considerations for the function 8(W), which is the smart way; or by doing explicitly the KK integrals for (1.77), that is the hard way; or numerically, which is the brute way. Even the last method requires some delicacy when handling the Cauchy principal value. Numerical integration is inevitable when 8 (w) is available only in tabulated form. When we look at the dispersion relation (1.77) and realize that 81 and 82 have the same denominator and contain the same quantities e, me, Y, w and wa, equations (2.90)-(2.92) which link 81 with 82 are no longer perplexing. However, when we discussed the physics associated with the optical constants n and k, which determine the phase velocity and the extinction, the two parameters appeared very distinct and independent so that any general connection between them comes, at first glance, as a surprise. 2.5.6.2 Dust absorption at very long wavelengths In a slowly varying electromagnetic field, a dielectric grain of arbitrary shape and composition absorbs, from (1.55), the power W = !VwIm{£t e }E5 = Cabs(w).

If we make in the range A > A I = 2n c / WI the replacement and write cabs = O'geo Qabs, where O'geo is the geometrical cross section, we get the following convergence condition: Therefore, the absorption efficiency of any grain must, at long wavelengths, fall off more steeply than A -I. But this last constraint attains practical importance only when we know the threshold wavelength after which it is valid. We could also have derived the result for Qabs(A) at long wavelengths using the dielectric permeability 8 instead of Ci e but then metals would have required some extra remarks because in conductors 82 --+ CXJ for w --+ 0, whereas their polarizability Ci e stays finite (see, for instance, (3.9)). A similar discussion to the one we carried out for Ci e holds for the magnetic polarizability Ci m . 2.5.6.3 Total grain volume One may apply the KK relation not only to grain material but also to the interstellar medium as such [Pur69]. Because it is so tenuous, its optical constant m = n + i k is very close to one. A small volume V in the interstellar medium of size d may, therefore, be considered to represent a Rayleigh-Gans particle. This class of grains, for which 1m - II « I and dim - II/A « I, is discussed in section 3.5.

There are many ways in which inhomogeneity can come about. For instance, if particles coagulate at some stage during their"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"72 How to evaluate grain cross sections evolution, the result will be a bigger particle with voids inside. The new big grain then has a fluffy structure and for its description, even if the grains before coagulation were homogeneous and chemically identical, at least one additional dielectric function is needed, namely that of vacuum (s =1). If chemically diverse particles stick together, one gets a heterogenous mixture. We note that purely thermal Brownian motion of grains (see section 9.3) is too small to make encounters between them significant but omnipresent turbulent velocities of 10 m S-1 are sufficient to ensure coagulation in dense clouds. Another way to produce inhomogeneities is to freeze out gas molecules on the surface of grains; this happens in cold clouds. A third possibility is that during grain formation tiny solid subparticles, like PAHs (section 12.1.1) or metal atoms, are built into the bulk material and contaminate it chemically. The chemical composition of interstellar dust is discussed in section 7.4 and in chapter 12. 2.6.1 Effective medium theories The cross section of composite particles can be computed exactly in those few cases where the components are homogeneous and the geometrical structure is simple; examples are spherical shells, cylinders with mantles or coated ellipsoids. For any real composite particle, where different media are intermixed in a most complicated manner, such computations are out of the question. To estimate the optical behavior of composite particles, one has to derive an average dielectric function Say representing the mixture as a whole. Once determined, Say is then used in Mie theory, usually assuming a spherical shape for the total composite grain. The starting point is the constitutive relation (D) = Say (E). (2.96) Here (E) is the average internal field and (D) the average displacement defined as (E) = ~ f E(x)dV (D) = ~ f sex) E(x) dV. (2.97) The integration extends over the whole grain volume V. If we envisage the grain to consist of a finite number of homogeneous components (subscript j), each with its own dielectric function S j and volume fraction /j, we can write (D) = L/jsjEj. j (2.98) The Ej are averages themselves (from (2.97)) over the subvolume /j V; we have just dropped the brackets. The constitutive relation (2.96) is thus replaced by LSj/jEj = Say L/jEj. j j (2.99)"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Composite grains 73 We envisage the components to be present in the form of many identical subparticles that are much smaller than the wavelength. When such a subparticle is placed into an extended medium with a spatially constant but time-variable field E', there is a linear relation between the field in the subparticle and the field in the outer medium (see sections 3.1 and 3.3), Ej = f3E'. (2.100) When one assumes that such a large-scale average field E' in the grain exists, one can remove the local fields Ej and find the average Say. 2.6.2 Garnett's mixing rule To exploit (2.99), we first imagine the grain to consist of a matrix (subscript m) containing inclusions (subscript i). For simplicity, let there be only one kind of inclusions with a total volume fraction Ii so that Ii + 1m = 1. For the constant large-scale field E' in (2.100), we take the field in the matrix and obtain sdif3 + smlm = Say/if3 + Say 1m. For spherical inclusions, the proportionality factor f3 in equation (2.100) has the form 3s m f3= --- Si + 2s m which is a generalization of equation (3.7) when the medium surrounding the sphere is not a vacuum but has some permeability Sm. We thus arrive at the Garnett formula: 1+ 2/i(Si - Sm)/(Si + 2s m ) Say = Sm . (2.101) 1- li(Si - Sm)/(Si + 2s m ) The expression is evidently not symmetric with respect to the inclusion and matrix. One has to make up one's mind which component should be regarded as the inclusion that pollutes the matrix. If the concentration of the inclusions, Ii, is small, equation (2.10 I) simplifies to ( Si - Sm ) Say = Sm I + 3 Ii . Si + 2s m The Garnett mixing rule is very similar to the Clausius-Mossotti law (see (3.55)). Indeed, the latter follows almost immediately from (2.101). The Clausius-Mossotti law gives the dielectric constant of an inhomogeneous medium that consists of a vacuum matrix (sm = I) with embedded spherical inclusions, the latter being atoms of polarizability a = (3/47T)(Si - I) /(Si + 2). The Garnett rule can be extended to an arbitrary number of components. One still has to make the distinction between the matrix (subscript m) and the inclusions (index i = I, 2, 3, ... ). Putting as before"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"74 How to evaluate grain cross sections we get the following generalization of (2.101), ImSm + L Idhsi Say = 1m + L lif3i where the sum of the volume fractions is unity, (2.102) Written in the form of (2.102), the restriction that the inclusions are spheres has been lifted. They may be of any shape, for example ellipsoids, for which f3i can be calculated as outlined in Section 3.3. One can also take a mean over randomly oriented ellipsoids. 2.6.3 The mixing rule of Bruggeman Next we suppose that none of the components of the grain is special, like the matrix in the Garnett theory. Then the components distinguish themselves only through their permeability and volume fraction; no assumption is made about the average field E'. Inserting (2.100) into (2.99) yields the Bruggeman rule: 0= L(Sj - Say)/jf3j j (2.103) with L /j = 1. Contrary to the Garnett rule, this formula is symmetric in all components j. If they consist of spherical entities, (2.104) Thus for n components, Say is determined from a complex polynomial of nth degree. When we imagine the interstellar dust to be a democratic compound of silicate, amorphous carbon, ice and vacuum, the Bruggeman mixing rule is preferred. However, when ice becomes dirty through contamination by tiny impurities (metal atoms or PAHs) that amount to only a small volume fraction (Ii « 1m), the Garnett rule is more appropriate. An illustration of how the dielectric permeabilities of two components combine to an avarage Say is shown in figure 2.6 for the two mixing rules and for a very idealized situation. The materials have the optical properties of harmonic oscillators with different resonance frequencies. In the mixture, the resonances are damped, broadened and shifted. 2.6.4 Composition of grains in protostellar cores Likely and astronomically relevant candidates for composite grains are the solid particles in cold and dense protostellar cloud cores (see section 15.3).

Coagulation, deposition of ice and porosity each affect the absorption coefficient and we now illustrate how. In the following examples, we fix A to I mm, which is a wavelength where protostellar cores are frequently observed. 2.6.5.1 Grain size We first investigate the influence of grain size. The mass absorption coefficient K abs (defined in subsection 2.1.3) is for a fixed wavelength a function of grain radius a, so K abs = Kabs(a).

No matter how efficient such a machine is, it is wise to retain some mental independence and bring to one's mind the physical aspects: computing must not be confused with understanding. In a few simple configurations, analytical solutions are possible and we turn to these in this chapter.

We now restrict the discussion to a dielectric medium. When x « I and Imx I « I, the electric field in the grain changes in a quasi-stationary fashion. When we want to calculate the field in such a configuration, we are reduced to an exercise in electrostatics. The basic equations valid everywhere are rotE = 0 divD = O. They impose the boundary conditions that the tangential component of the electric field E and the normal component of the displacement D are continuous on the grain surface. For a homogeneous medium (8 = constant), this leads to the Laplace equation !'1cp = 0 where cP is the potential related to the field through E = - V cp. When we place a sphere of radius a, volume V and dielectric constant 8 into a constant field E, the field becomes deformed. Let the sphere be at the center of the coordinate system. We label the field inside the sphere by E i and outside it (external) by E e . For the potential cp of the deformed field we make the ansatz [ E. r _ -E·r+cI-- cp - r 3 -C2E· r outside sphere inside sphere (3.6) where r is the position coordinate of length r = Irl, and CI, C2 are constants.

Inside the sphere, E i is constant and parallel to E; outside, E e is the sum of a dipole, which is induced by E and goes to zero at large distances, plus the constant field E. We determine CI and C2 from the conditions on the grain surface. Continuity of the tangential component of the electric field implies continuity of the tangential derivative of cp, from which it follows that cp is itself continuous (parallel and perpendicular to the surface). This gives C2 = I - CI / a 3 . Continuity of the normal component of the displacement D yields 8C2 = I + 2cI / a 3 .

The oscillating dipole, which is now the grain as a whole, emits radiation. Its average power integrated over all directions is W = Iv12/3c3 and follows from (1.97). However, W must also equal the total power scattered from the incident wave by the particle, therefore, W = -1-lvI 2 = S C sea . 3c 3 (3.12) For the dipole moment, we have to insert p = £t e YE and for the time- averaged Poynting vector S = (c/8n)E5 from (1.39), therefore (3.13) The electric polarizability £t e for spheres is given by (3.9). It was obtained in the electrostatic approximation. Can we use it in the case when (J) =!= O? Yes, we can because the variations of the field are assumed to be slow, so the electron configuration is always relaxed. This means the electrons always have sufficient time to adjust to the momentary field, just as in the static case. Of course, the polarization of the medium is not that of a static field. Instead, the dielectric permeability must be taken at the actual frequency (J) of the outer field. Because (J) =!= 0, the permeability s ((J)) is complex, which automatically takes care of the time lag between P and E.

Mie theory, which is based on the classical electrodynamics of a continuous medium, fails when the structure of matter or quantum effects become important. A more general theory is then needed to describe the optical behavior of particles. We will consider some quantum effects when we discuss PAHs, a specific kind of very small carbon grains. Here we only remark on the influence of the surface in the case of small grains. Whereas atoms inside the particle are surrounded from all sides, the situation is different for those on the surface which have bonds only towards the particle's interior. This has consequences, for example, for their ability to bind to gas atoms or for the specific heat of the grain. If the particle has a diameter a, the ratio of the number of surface atoms Nsurf to all atoms N in the grain is roughly Nsurf ::::: 6 ro . N a As the lattice constant is of order 2 A, a substantial fraction of atoms is on the surface only when the particle is small. One way in which the surface affects the optical grain properties can be understood when we interpret the damping constant y in the motion of an electron (see (1.59)) as a collision frequency with atoms of the crystal. If the particle is small, an additional term must be added to the damping constant that comes from collisions (reflections) at the surface.

One might, therefore, think there would be no absorption and just scattering with an efficiency Qsca = 8x 4 /3 (because Im{(s - l)/(s + 2)} = 0, one has to use the x 6 term in the coefficient al of equation (3.3)). But not quite because we have neglected in our small-size approximation the magnetic field which is also present in a wave. Let us now include it; Mie calculations automatically do. When we place a particle in a constant magnetic field H, there is a formal identity with electrostatics. There are the same types of equations, rotH = 0 divB = 0 and the same boundary conditions on the surface: the tangential component of H and the normal of B = JLH are continuous. So there is nothing new in magnetostatics. 3.2.1 Slowly varying field The situation becomes interesting when the magnetic field H is slowly alternating, say, proportionally to e- iw1 • Slowly means that H is spatially uniform over the dimension of the body or, in other words, that the particle is small.

Figure 3.3 displays, over a broad wavelength band, what happens to the optical depth when we replace spheres of a fixed radius by randomly oriented spheroids, identical in shape and of the same volume as the spheres. It turns out, although not as a strict rule, that ellipsoids have a higher average cross section, CaY, than spheres and the effect increases with eccentricity. We can understand this because Cay is, from (3.45), the arithmetic mean over C a , Cb, C e . When we evaluate the Cs assuming a ::: b ::: c we find that (mostly) C a ::: Cb ::: C e in such a way that the increase in C a more than offsets the decline in Cb or C e . With fixed eccentricity, the cross section is still a function of the optical constant m and thus of wavelength A. Any wiggle in m due to a resonance will be reflected in the curves. We show results for silicate and carbon particles and we can readily identify the resonances in silicate at 10 and 18 !Lm by comparison with figure 7.19. The difference between cigars and pancakes is mild. Overall, the effect of particle elongation on the optical depth is more pronounced in the far than in the near infrared. For example, grains with an axial ratio of two, which implies an eccentricity of 0.866, are at A ::: 100!Lm by some 30% better emitters or absorbers than spheres. As a further sophistication, one can treat optically anisotropic ellipsoids. Graphite particles are an example. When the carbon sheets are stacked parallel to the (x, y)-plane, one has ex = ey =!= ez. It is also not difficult to extend the computations of cross sections to coated ellipsoids but for particulars. 3.3.6 Rotation about the axis of greatest moment of inertia The cross section of spinning particles changes periodically and one has to take time averages. Suppose a spheroid rotates about the major axis where the moment of inertia is greatest. For cigars, this is axis b or c, for pancakes it is axis c. The rotation axis stays fixed in space, while the other two are spinning. Let the light propagate in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and let CEl-rot denote the time-averaged cross sections in the case when the electric vector of the incident wave is parallel and perpendicular to the rotation axis, respectively.

In section 3.3 we generalized to ellipsoids. In both cases, the polarization P of the medium is constant and the field inside smaller than outside. Writing the internal field E i in the form defines a new field El. It arises from all atomic dipoles and is directed opposite to the polarization P. Because E i < E, one calls El the depolarization field (see figure 3.4). For example, from (3.7) we find for a sphere (3.51) It is important to make a distinction between the local field at exactly one point and macroscopic averages. El and E i are such averages over many atoms, a hundred or so but at least over one unit cell in a crystalline structure. On a microscopic level, the field has tremendous gradients. Atoms are not at random positions but at privileged sites (lattice grid points are loci of minimum potential"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"100 Very small and very big particles energy) and the local field E 10c acting on an atom is usually different from the average field E i , so generally E 10c =!= E i . To find E 10c at a specific locus in the grain, say at xo, we have to add to E the fields from all dipoles. As the dipoles are at discrete lattice points, their distribution is not smooth, at least, it does not appear to be so close to xo. We, therefore, imagine a spherical cavity around Xo of such a size that beyond the cavity the dipole distribution may be regarded as smooth, whereas inside it, it is discontinuous, so E 10c = E + L Edip + L Edip. outside cavity (3.52) The field arising from the smooth distribution outside the cavity can be expressed as a volume integral, the field from the dipoles within the cavity has to be explicitly written as a sum. 3.4.2 Depolarization field and the distribution of surface charges A body of constant polarization P has, on its outside, a surface charge a of strength a =e·P (3.53) where e is the outward surface normal. This expression for a follows when we recall that according to (1.20) a non-uniform polarization creates a charge ppol = - div P. Inside the body, the divergence of the polarization vector is zero and Ppol = 0 but on its surface, P is discontinuous and a charge appears. There is a theorem which states that for any body of constant polarization P, the depolarization field El is identical to the field that arises in vacuum from the distribution of surface charges as given by (3.53). Let <p(r) be the electrostatic potential from all dipoles in the body. We prove the theorem by writing <p(r) as a volume integral, <p(r) = - f (p. Vr- 1 ) dV. This is correct because a single dipole p has a potential Now we transform the volume integral into a surface integral employing the relation div(fP) = f div P + P . V f. With f (r) = 1/ r and div P = 0, we get <p(r) = - f ~P' dS = f ~ dS.

According to our theorem, it is equivalent to the field from the surface charges. However, there are now two boundaries. The outer, Sl, gives the depolarization field El. The inner, S2, has the same surface charge as a sphere in vacuum of constant polarization P, only of inverted sign. Comparing with (3.51), we find that the surface charge on S2 produces the field (47T /3)P. It remains to include the atoms in the spherical cavity S2. Suppose we have a cubic lattice, the dipoles are at positions (Xi, Yi, Zi), their moments are all of strength p and aligned in the z-direction, the point Xo is at the origin.

Hence a is called the atomic polarizability. The formula is analogous to (1.8) which we applied to a grain as a whole.

As in the case of tiny grains, the definition is relative and the same particle may be both small and large, depending on the wavelength. To quantify the diffraction phenomena that occur around very big grains, we have to study basic optical principles. 3.5.1 Babinet's theorem For any very large particle the extinction efficiency, approaches two, independently of the chemical composition or shape of the particle. This important result is called Babinet's theorem or extinction paradox. For spheres, 2na when x = -- --+ 00. A (3.57) We illustrate Babinet's theorem with an experiment carried out in three steps as sketched in figure 3.5: (l) When a parallel wavefront falls on an orifice, which is much bigger than the wavelength, it produces, on a far-away screen, a bright spot with a blurred rim. Outside the bright spot and the rim, the screen is dark. We restrict the discussion to this dark area. (2) If one places a small, but still much bigger than A, obstacle into the orifice, a diffraction pattern appears and light is scattered beyond the blurred rim into the former dark area. (3) If we cover the orifice with black paper leaving just a hole of the same size and shape as the obstacle, the diffraction patterns of the hole and the obstacle are identical. According to Huygens' principle for wave propagation (this result will be shown later), the diffraction pattern of the obstacle arises because each point in the plane of the orifice, except for the obstacle itself, is the origin of a spherical wave; the diffraction pattern of the hole arises because each point in the plane of the hole is the origin of a spherical wave. In the case of the completely uncovered orifice (l), both diffraction patterns are present simultaneously. Because the region beyond the blurred rim is then dark, the patterns from the obstacle and the hole must cancel each other exactly, i.e. they must have the same intensity but be phase-shifted by 180°. As the hole scatters all the light falling onto it, the obstacle must scatter exactly the same amount.

Per wavelength of penetration, the intensity decreases by a factor exp( -4nk). Unless k is very small, the transmitted light is removed very quickly and the penetration depth is only a few wavelengths. One may wonder about the implications of formula (3.60) for a blackbody. By definition, it has zero reflectance and would, therefore, require the optical constant of vacuum (m = 1). But a vacuum is translucent. So no real substance is a perfect absorber. A blackbody can be approximated by a particle with n --+ 1 and k --+ 0; the particle must also have a very large size d such that kd / 'A is much greater than one, despite the smallness of k. 35.2.2 Oblique incidence We generalize the reflectance r of (3.60) to the case of oblique incidence. If the incident beam is inclined to the normal of the surface element of the particle by some angle 8i > 0, the reflected beam forms an angle 8 r = 8i with the normal. The angle of the transmitted beam is given by Snell's law: . sin8i sm8 t = --. m (3.61) (3.62) (3.63) Whereas for a non-absorbing medium, m and 8 t are real, in the generalized form of (3.61) m and also 8 t are complex. One now has to specify in which direction the incident light is polarized which is not necessary under normal incidence. For incident unpolarized light the reflectance is 1 1 cos 8 t - m cos 8i 1 2 1 1 cos 8i - m cos 8 t 1 2 r =:.2 cos 8 t + m cos 8i +:.2 cos 8i + m cos 8 t Using this formula, we can determine the limiting value of Qabs and Qsca for very large spheres. If the particle is translucent (k = 0), it only scatters the light; then Qabs = 0 and Qsca = Qext = 2 according to Babinet's theorem. If k > 0, any light that enters the grain will, under the assumption of ray optics, eventually peter out within it. One can define a reflection efficiency Qref for spheres by na 2 Qref = l a 2nr(x)dx where r(x) is the reflectance after (3.62) for an incident angle 8i = arcsin(x/a) and a is the grain radius. Qref lies between 0 and 1 and is related to Qabs through Qabs = 1 - Qref. So the absorption efficiency for large particles can never be greater than one, only smaller if some fraction of light is reflected off the surface. 3.5.3 Huygens' principle In figure 3.7, a point source Q emits isotropically radiation.

The superposition (interference) of all elementary waves of equal radius originating from the surface S fixes the position of the wavefront in the future and thus describes the propagation of the primary wave.

The new surface S' is the envelope of all elementary waves of radius r. Outside S', the field of elementary waves is extinguished by interference. Applied to plane waves, which are spherical waves of very large radius, Huygens' principle makes understandable why light propagates along straight lines. It also explains the laws of refraction and reflection in geometrical optics. To derive them from Huygens' principle, one just has to assume that all surface elements on the plane separating two media of different optical constants, n 1 and n2, oscillate in phase and emit elementary waves which propagate with the phase velocity v = c/ n of the respective medium. If there is an obstacle in the way of the primary wave, some region on the surface of its wavefront, corresponding in size and shape to the projected area of the obstacle, does not create secondary waves.

Because in G, the wave equation is fulfilled for u and v, i.e. /';.u + k 2 u = 0 and /';.v + k 2 v = 0, the volume integral vanishes and only the surface integral is left.

Suppose we have a source Q behind an opaque plane with an orifice S of arbitrary shape and we want to determine the intensity up at a point P in front of the plane (see figure 3.1 0).

This problem affords a nice graphical solution. The situation is depicted in figure 3.12. To determine the field at P, opposite to S, one has to sum up all elementary waves from the plane in which the wall lies.

The following vector E j + I is rotated by an angle that increases as one approaches the asymptotic points, thus the curvature of the spiral increases too. The sum of all field vectors E j at the point P has two parts: • the first includes all Ej of elementary waves emitted from points above S, up to infinity; and • the second consists of all E j from points below S, down to the edge of the wall.

If we imagine the total grain volume V to be divided into many tiny subvolumes Vi with L Vi = V, each of them absorbs and scatters independently of the others. For example, if the subvolumes are ellipsoids, their absorption and scattering cross sections are given by (3.42) and (3.43), which we derived in the Rayleigh limit. Consequently, the absorption cross section cabs of the total grain is also given by formula (3.42). Therefore, the absorption efficiency of a Rayleigh-Gans sphere for any x is Qabs = 8x Im{m _ I}. 3 To find the scattering cross section or the scattered intensity in a certain direction, one cannot simply sum the contributions of the subvolumes because there is a phase difference between them which leads to interference. It is this effect which, for large bodies, tends to reduce csca(A) with respect to (3.43). The formalism for how waves originating from different points (subvolumes) are added up is basically the same as that discussed in section 2.2 on the optical theorem.

But even the extinction efficiency, which is the cross section over projected area, goes to zero, for x --+ O.

The phenomenon of ripples and waves can be traced to the behavior of the coefficients an, b n of (2.50), (2.51) and is due to interference in the scattered wave (see(2.46)).

Unity is the value of Qabs of a blackbody and may thus appear to be an upper limit for any object. Nevertheless, the calculations are correct, only the concept of a blackbody is reserved to sizes much larger than the wavelength. 4.1.4 A metal sphere • Ideally, a metal has (at low frequencies) a purely imaginary dielectric permeability so that n ::::: k goes to infinity (see (1.117)). • A metallic sphere is, therefore, very reflective and Qabs tends to zero. • When the sphere is big, Qext is, as always, close to the Babinet limit of two. • When the sphere is big, of all the light removed, half is scattered isotropically and it alone would yield an asymmetry factor g = O. The other half is scattered at the particle's rim entirely in the forward direction, which alone would produce g = 1. The combination of both effects gives g = !. • When the sphere has a size comparable or smaller than the wavelength, backward scattering dominates (g < 0). • For small values of Imx I, the metallic sphere also obeys the relation Qabs » Qsca. But as x grows, the scattering increases and soon takes over, whereas the absorption stays at some low level.

We can now understand why the daylight sky is blue. If there were no atmosphere, it would appear black, except for the stars, Sun and planets. However, the tiny air molecules scatter the sunlight towards us. Because Qsca ex: A -4 and Ablue < Ared, the sky is painted blue. An additional requirement is that the air molecules are randomly moving, as otherwise interference would cancel out the intensity except in the forward direction. The scattered light is polarized and maximum polarization occurs 90 0 away from the Sun (see (3.19)), or at night time 90 0 away from the moon. As preferentially blue light is removed in scattering, the transmitted light becomes redder. But this does not explain the occasional romantic sunsets. More relevant for the reddening towards the horizon is the removal of blue light through absorption by tiny solid particles. These may arise from industrial exhausts, a sand storm or a volcano eruption. The dependence of absorption on A is less steep than for scattering but qualitatively similar (Qabs ex: A -I) and also results in reddening. We can also explain why we see the water in the air only when it has liquefied into clouds, and not as vapor. When on a summer day the solar heating induces convection and a parcel of air rises we see the parcel only at the moment the water condenses, although the H20 molecules were there before. This seems puzzling because upon condensation the water molecules do not drastically change their properties as radiating oscillators. The reason that they become visible when they cluster into droplets is the following: The mass scattering coefficient K sca is, according to table 4.1, proportional to the volume V of a single scatterer (one H20 molecule or one water droplet).

In the ultraviolet, the dependence of Sll (cos e) on the scattering angle is complicated and the curves in figure 4.10 may only be used if e is not too far from 90 0 • As an exercise, we apply figure 4.10 to answer the question: What is the approximate V -band surface brightness of scattered light in a reflection nebula? The nebula is D = I kpc away and excited by a main sequence star of spectral type B I with L = 10 4 L 0 and T* = 2 x 10 4 K. We calculate this quantity at a projected distance from the star of r = 0.1 pc assuming that the extinction along the line of sight through the nebula equals Av = 0.1 mag. An extinction of 0.1 mag corresponds after (7.23) to a hydrogen column density NH = 2 x 10 20 cm- 2 . This gives, with a gas-to-dust mass ratio of ISO and accounting for 10% of helium, a dust mass of 7.0 x 10 26 g in a column with a cross section of I arcsec 2 . If the star is approximated by a blackbody, its visual flux at a distance r = 0.1 pc is Fa, v = 9.80 x 10- 15 erg S-1 cm- 2 . For a rough estimate, we neglect that the distance of the scattering dust to the star changes along the line of sight. Let the particles have radii a = 10- 5 cm. Then we read off from figure 4.10 at a wavelength of 0.55 !Lm for right angle scattering that ('A 2 / a 3 ) x Sll ::::: 8 x 10 5 . With the factor W A = 3640 to convert Jy into magnitudes from table 7.2, we find a surface brightness in the nebula at V of 18.5 mag arcsec- 2 . 4.3 Coated spheres The mathematical formalism of Mie theory presented in section 2.3 can readily be extended to coated spheres. Only the appearance of two more boundary conditions at the interface between the two dust materials is new. The relevance of calculating coated particles stems from the observational fact that grains in cold clouds acquire ice mantles. Such particles may be approximated by two concentric spheres. There is a refractory core of radius acore and optical constant mcore surrounded by a volatile shell of thickness d and optical constant mshell. So the total grain radius is atot = acore + d. The left box in figure 4.11 shows the absorption efficiency Qabs as a function of size parameter x for homogeneous particles with optical constants m = 2.7 + i and m = 1.33 + 0.03i.

However, in the case of grains which are small compared with the wavelength, the extinction cross section may be large without an accompanying feature in the bulk matter. As the extinction efficiency is in the Rayleigh limit after (3.3) proportional to 82/18 + 21 2 , we expect a large value for Qext at a wavelength where 8 +2::::: O. Because 8 = m 2 , this happens when the real part n of the optical constant is close to zero and k 2 ~ 2. The phenomenon bears the name suiface mode."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"134 Case studies of Mie calculus For the major components of interstellar dust, amorphous carbon and silicate, there is no wavelength where the condition of small 8+2 is approximately fulfilled (see figure 7.19) but graphite around 2200 A is a candidate. Graphite is optically anisotropic and the effect appears when the electric vector of the incoming wave lies in the basal plane of the stacked carbon sheets; the dielectric constant is then denoted by 81... The left-hand side of figure 4.12 shows 81.. = 81 + i82 and the resulting extinction efficiency for spheres of different sizes. The wavelength interval stretches from 1670 to 3330 A or from 6 to 3 /Lm- I . To underline the effect of the surface mode, Qext is normalized to one at A -I = 3 /Lm- I . Small particles (a :s 300 A) clearly display a resonance around 2200 A, which is absent in the bulk material because particles with a radius greater than 1000 A do not show it. The graphite surface mode is invoked to explain the strong feature around 2200 A in the interstellar extinction curve (figure 7.8). For the Rayleigh approximation to be valid, the particles must have diameters of 100 A or less. But the position of the resonance contains further information on grain size. The upper left box of figure 4.12 illustrates how the peak in Qext drifts towards smaller wavelengths (greater A -I) with decreasing radius a; it moves from 2280 to 2060 A as the radius shrinks from 300 to 30 A. There is no further shift for still smaller particles. In astronomical observations of the extinction curve, the relevant quantities are, however, not the extinction efficiencies Qext but the extinction coefficients per cm 3 of dust volume, K ext . They are shown in the upper right frame of figure 4.12. The dependence of K ext on A -I is qualitatively similar to that of Qext but the discrimination against size is more difficult and not possible below 100 A. 4.4.0.2 Ellipsoids From comparison of the electric polarizability for spherical and ellipsoidal particles (see (3.9) and (3.39)), it follows that the condition 8 + 2 ::::: 0, necessary for the appearance of a surface mode in spheres, must for ellipsoids be replaced by or similar expressions for the y- or z-axis. The form of the particle therefore influences, via the shape factor Lx, the strength of the surface mode as well as its center wavelength. 4.4.0.3 Metals versus dielectrics Figure 4.13 illustrates the interplay between 8 and Qext in a surface mode for a dielectric consisting of identical harmonic oscillators. The variation of 8 is, of course, similar to figure 1.2, only the resonance is here sharper (y = 0.05).

We thus have all the tools to calculate the cross section due to magnetic dipole absorption.

The dissipation rate of the latter is given by (1.55), an expression formally identical to (1.57). There is also magnetic dipole scattering but it is much weaker in the Rayleigh limit and we neglect it here. In figure 4.17, we assess the importance of magnetic dipole absorption for pure metal spheres by comparing the corresponding efficiency Qma g with the total Qtot, which also contains electric dipole absorption. Barring quadrupole terms, we have Qtot = Qma g + Qel. We assume that s has no dielectric contribution and put (see (1.115)) 47Ta s=i-- (J) where a is the direct-current conductivity of (1.120).

An equivalent formula for the Rayleigh limit of the electric dipole absorption efficiency Qel is not valid everywhere in figure 4.17; although the particle itself is small, being a metal, the relevant quantity Imx I is not necessarily so. Obviously, magnetic dipole absorption increases with the conductivity and it can be the dominant absorption process.

We outline the derivation of this fundamental statistical relation and append a few loosely connected items. 5.1.1 The probability of an arbitrary energy distribution We first compute the number of ways in which the energy of N identical particles, for example atoms, can be distributed and then find among them the most likely distribution. To this end, we divide the energy space, which ranges from zero to some maximum E max , into n ordered cells with mean energy Ei so that Each cell has a size /';.Ei which determines its statistical weight gi /';.Ei / E max .

According to elementary probability theory, a configuration where N particles are grouped as shown here can be achieved in N! Q = (5.1) NI!N2! ... N n ! ways. Here it is assumed that the particles are distinguishable. Q is called the thermodynamic probability and is a very large number. When the N atoms are arbitrarily distributed over the available cells, the probability that the first NI atoms fall into cell EI, the following N2 atoms into cell E2, and so forth equals Nl N2 Nil gl . g2 ..... gn .

(5.19) g= This relation results from the wave character possessed by all particles, not just photons. The wavelength of a particle is related to its momentum (after de Broglie) by p = hiA. Because of the wave character, particles in a box of volume V can only have discrete momenta, otherwise they would be destroyed by interference. The situation is formally almost identical to standing waves in a crystal, which we treat in section 8.4. We may, therefore, exploit equation (8.31) of that section and find that the possible number of eigenfrequencies within the momentum interval p to p + dp in a box of volume V is V . 4 7Tp 2 dp h 3 The eigenfrequencies are the only allowed states in which a particle can exist and correspond to standing waves. The quantity g (named dZ in (8.31)) is called the statistical weight (see also (5.12)). It states how many unit cells, each of size h 3 , fit into the phase space element d<P. Note that classically the number of possible (physically different) states is unlimited, which would correspond to a unit cell of size zero. To determine the state of a particle with non-zero spin, one needs, besides place and momentum, the spin direction. Therefore, the number of quantum states of an electron (spin ~) is twice the value given in (5.19). The same is true for photons (spin 1) which, traveling at the speed of light, also have two (not three) spin directions. 5.2.2 Bosons and fermions Particles are described by their position in phase space. Any two particles of the same kind, for example, two photons or two electrons, are otherwise identical. This means that when we swap their positions in phase space, nothing changes physically, the particles are indistinguishable. In quantum mechanics, particles are represented by their wavefunctions. Let 'IF (Xl , X2, ... , x n ) denote the wavefunction of a system of n particles, all of one kind and not interacting. Their identity then implies that l'lFI 2 stays the same when any two of the particles are interchanged.

We, therefore, write 'IF (XI , X2, ... , x n ) as a sum of such terms but with interchanged arguments; this corresponds to swapping particles. For example, the first term of the sum is (5.20) and the next, where particles 1 and 2 have been exchanged, and so forth. Each such product is a wavefunction that gives the same total energy E but fails to fulfil the symmetry condition. Note that in a multi-dimensional function it does not matter by which symbols the arguments are presented, what counts is the sequence in which they appear. So! (XI, X2) = Xlxi and g(X2, XI) = X~X2 are identical functions but !(XI, X2) and h(XI, X2) = X~X2 are different. • It can readily be checked that the linear combination 'lFBose(XI, X2, ... , xn) = L Po/I (Xd0/2 (X2) ..... o/n (x n ) p (5.21) and no other, is symmetric and yields the correct energy E.

This has the fundamental consequence, known as Pauli's exclusion principle, that two fermions cannot have the same wavefunction, i.e. they cannot occupy the same quantum state or unit cell. Bosons, however, are not subject to Pauli's exclusion principle.

First, we consider only one cell, say cell i of size d <P. Its Ni atoms constitute a subsystem. We ask in how many ways can one distribute its Ni particles over its gi unit cells (quantum states). Let us label the unit cells within d<P by ZI, Z2, ... , Zgi and the atoms by ai, a2, ... , aNi.

The Saha equation goes wrong when the mean distance d between ions becomes comparable to the size 2r of an atom. This happens in stellar interiors where the density is high, although LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) certainly prevails. An atom is then closely surrounded by ions and the overlap of their electric fields disturbs the higher quantum states and lowers the ionization energy. Atoms in high quantum number n are big. For hydrogen, their radius is r = aon 2 where ao is the Bohr radius. In the central region of the Sun (p '\" 10 2 g cm- 3 , T '\" 15 x 10 6 K), d is less than the Bohr radius and even the ground state of hydrogen cannot exist, although the Saha equation predicts that about half of all atoms are neutral. 5.3 Thermodynamics This section summarizes the results of thermal and statistical physics. For the computation of the population of energy levels in the smallest grains (see section 12.1) we have to recall the definition of temperature, entropy and number of accessible states. The formulae around the specific heat find their application mainly in the theory of magnetic dissipation in section 11.2. Some of the thermodynamic elements presented here are also indispensable in the discussion of phase transition during the formation and evaporation of grains (see section 9.5). 5.3.1 The ergodic hypothesis Boltzmann's equilibrium population of the energy levels of a system was derived by determining the energetically most likely distribution. More generally, instead of energy space one considers the phase space of the system; the path of the atoms in phase space contains the full mechanical information. A system of f degrees of freedom is described by the spatial coordinates ql, ... , q f and the"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Thermodynamics 161 conjugate momenta PI, ... , P j. Usually one needs three coordinates (x, y, z) for one particle, so if there are N particles, 1=3N. Let the system be isolated so that it cannot exchange energy with its surroundings. The total energy E is, therefore, constant or, rather, it is in a narrow range from E to E + 8E, because in quantum mechanics, E cannot be defined with absolute precision in a finite time. At any instant, the system may be represented by a point in the 2/- dimensional phase space with the coordinates ql, ... , qj, PI, ... , Pj. As the system evolves in time t, it describes a trajectory parametrized by (ql(t), ... , Pj(t))· If one divides the phase space into small cells Z of equal size, the microstate of the system at a particular moment is determined by the cell in which it is found. The cells may be enumerated. All cells (states) Zi that correspond to an energy between E and E + 8E are called accessible. In equilibrium, the probability to find the system in a certain accessible cell Zr is, by definition, independent of time. • The fundamental (ergodic) postulate asserts that when the system is in equilibrium, all accessible states are equally likely, none has any preference. Let Q (E) be the total number of accessible states (cells), i.e. those with energy in the interval [E, E + 8E]. If there are many degrees of freedom (f » 1), the function Q(E) increases extremely rapidly with the total energy E of the system. To see how fast Q (E) rises, we make a rough estimate. Let our system consist of identical quantum oscillators, each corresponding to one degree of freedom. Their energy levels are equally spaced in multiples of lUv. Each oscillator has on average an energy E /1. After equation (6.26), it is spread out in one-dimensional phase space over a region ~x ~P = E /1 (J) where it thus occupies E /llUv cells of size n. It does not make sense to consider cells smaller than n because one cannot locate a particle more accurately. The number of states, N s , of the total system whose energy does not exceed E is, therefore, (5.41) Hence the number of cells, Q (E), with energies from [E, E + 8 E] becomes Q(E) = Ns(E + 8E) - Ns(E) ::::: dN s 8E. dE We denote by dN s p(E) =- dE the density of states around energy E. It is independent of the width of the chosen energy interval 8 E, contrary to Q (E) which obviously increases with 8 E. As a"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"162 Particle statistics first approximation, one gets p(E) ::::: f E!-I /(fnw)!. If one counts the states more properly but neglects powers of E with exponents f - 2 or smaller, one finds E!-I p(E) ::::: (f _ 1)!(nw)!· (5.42) If the total energy E of the system is n times greater than the natural energy unit nw, the density of states becomes proportional to n!-I /(f - 1)1. Note that p and Q rise with E! -I. When we evaluate Q for something from everyday life, like the gas content in an empty bottle, the number of degrees of freedom of the atoms is '\" 10 24 . This, by itself, is a huge number but because f appears as an exponent, Q is so large that even its logarithm In Q is of order f, or 10 24 . The probability that all gas atoms in a box are huddled in the upper left-hand comer and the rest of the box is void is extremely low, one will never encounter such a configuration. After the ergodic principle, all accessible cells in a phase space have an equal chance of being populated. The probability of a particular microstate which actually is encountered and where the atoms are very evenly distributed must, therefore, be equally low. There is no contradiction because there is just one cell corresponding to all atoms being clustered in one comer but a multitude corresponding to a very smooth distribution of atoms over the available box volume. 5.3.2 Definition of entropy and temperature In statistical physics, the starting point is the number of accessible states Q (E) with energies from [E, E + 8E]; it determines the entropy, S = klnQ. (5.43) Of course, Q(E) depends on the width of the energy interval 8E but because Q is so large, one can easily show that 8E is irrelevant in (5.43). The absolute temperature T is then defined by 1 as kaE a lnp aE 1 kT (5.44) Let us see what these two definitions mean for a bottle of warm lemonade (system A) in an icebox (system A'). The two systems are in thermal contact, i.e. heat can flow between them but the external parameters (like volume) are fixed. The total system, A + A', is isolated (we do not have an electric icebox), so the joint energy E tot = E + E ' is constant; otherwise E and E ' are arbitrary. The number of accessible states of the whole system, subject to the condition that subsystem A has an energy E, is given by the product Q(E)QI(E tot - E), where Q and Q' refer to A and A', respectively. The probability P(E) of finding the whole system in a state where A has the energy E is evidently proportional to this product, P(E) ex: Q(E)· QI(E tot - E)."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Thermodynamics 163 When Q (E) rises, Q' (E tot - E) must fall. Because of the extreme dependence of the number of accessible states Q on E, or of Q' on E', the probability P(E) must have a very sharp maximum at some value E eq . To find system A at an energy E =1= E eq is totally unlikely. The probability P(E) is almost a 8-function, the value where it is not zero determines equilibrium. The energy E where P, or the entropy S + S', of the whole system has its maximum follows from a InP --=0. aE This equation immediately gives as I as' I aE E=E eq = aE' E'=E~q which means that in equilibrium the temperature of the icebox and lemonade are equal, the lemonade is cool. Note that nothing has been said about how long it takes, starting from some arbitrary microstate, to arrive at equilibrium. 5.3.3 The canonical distribution Let a system A be in thermal contact with a much larger heat bath A' of temperature T. The energy of A is not fixed, only the joint energy E tot of the combined system A + A'. Suppose now that A is in a definite state r of energy E r . The heat bath has then the energy E' = E tot - E r and Q' (E tot - E r ) accessible states. The probabity P r for A being in state r is proportional to the number of states of the total system A + A' under that condition, therefore, as A is fixed to state r, P r = C'Q'(E tot - E r ). The constant C' follows from the condition Ls P s = 1 in which the sum includes all possible states s of A, irrespective of their energy. Because E tot » E r , one can develop In Q' around E tot , InQ'(E tot - E r ) = InQ'(E tot ) - f3E r where f3 = alnQ'/aE' = (kT)-1 (see (5.44)), and obtains the canonical distribution e-f3E r P r = Ls e-f3E s . (5.45) The sum in the denominator represents the partition function Z(T).

Formula (5.46) is in agreement with the Boltzmann distribution (5.9): As the size of system A has not entered the derivation of P(E), the expression is also correct when A is a microscopic system. Thermal contact then just means that A can exchange energy with A'. If A consists of just one atom with discrete energy levels E j, there is only one state for which E = E j, so Q (E) = 1 and one recovers the Boltzmann distribution (5.9). 5.331 Constraints on the system Sometimes a macroscopic system A may have to fulfil additional constraints, besides having an energy between E and E + 0 E. For example, some parameter Y may have to take up a certain precise value y, or lie in the range [y, y + oy]; we then symbolically write Y = y. The parameter Y may be anything, for example, the energy of ten selected atoms or the integrated magnetic moment of all particles. The states for which Y = y form a subclass of all accessible states, and we denote their total number by Q (E; y). In view of the ergodic postulate, the probability P of finding the system in the desired configuration Y = y is P( ) = Q(E; y). y Q(E) Likewise the probability P can be expressed by the ratio of the densities of states, P( ) = p(E; y). y p(E) (5.48) 5.3.4 Thermodynamic relations for a gas When one transfers to a system a small amount of heat 0 Q and does the work oA on the system, then, according to the first law of thermodynamics, its internal energy U is altered by the amount dU = oQ +oA. If the infinitesimal work is due to a change of volume dV, oA = -pdV. (5.49) So when V is decreased, oA is positive. If U depends on temperature and volume, U = U(T, V) and dU = (au) dT + (au) dV aT v av T and because of equation (5.49), oQ = (~~)v dT + [(~~t + p] dV.

For a mechanical system, all forces Fi acting on the particles must vanish. The forces derive from a potential ¢, so Fi = -a¢ /aXi. In equilibrium, the potential ¢ is at its minimum and the differential fl¢ = O. For an isolated thermodynamic system A of constant energy U and volume V, the entropy SA attains its maximum. Therefore, the differential flSA is zero under small variations of the variables (U, V, Nj). If A is not isolated but in contact with a heat bath A', the equilibrium condition for the total system A + A' reads: flS tot = fl(SA + SA') = O. System A receives from the environment A' the heat 8 Q = - T flSA' which increases its internal energy by flU and does the work 8A on the system (see (5.49)), 8Q = T flSA = flU - 8A. As all variables here refer to system A, we may drop the index A in the entropy and get flU - T flS - 8A = O. In the case of pure compressional work, 8A = - P fl V and flU - T flS + pfl V = O. (5.58) Equation (5.58) leads in a straightforward way to the following equilibrium conditions: (1) In a system A of constant temperature and volume (flT = fl V = 0) and in contact with a heat reservoir A', the differential of the free energy vanishes under small changes of the variables, flF = fl(U - T S) = O. F has then its minimum because Stot of the total system A + A' is at its maximum.

In a nearby, almost-equilibrium state b, the corresponding populations are Nl + 1 and N2 -1.

Let system A depend on some parameter Y. The number of accessible states where Y takes up values between y and y + 8y is (see (5.43)) Qtot(y) = eS,o,(y)/k and the probability P (y) of such states is proportional to Qtot(y). Likewise, P(y') ex: Qtot(y') = eS,o,(y')/k for another value y' of the parameter Y.

The total energy per s over a certain spectral interval is, of course, the same for FA and F v . If one wants to detect a blackbody with an instrument that has a sensitivity curve Sv, one usually tries to maximize f SvBv(T) dv.

Interstellar grains are certainly not blackbodies but the shape of the spectral energy distribution from a dusty region may at far infrared wavelengths be approximated by v m Bv(T) (see (8.1) for the correct expression) if the emission is optically thin and the absorption coefficient has a power-law dependence K v ex: v m .

Only when x « 1, does one obtain the classical result. It is also enlightening to apply the first principles of thermodynamics to a photon gas in equilibrium. A gas of volume V and internal energy U (T) = u(T)V has the gas pressure P = u/3. Because dU = udV + V du, the differential dS = dQ/T of the entropy is given by dS = dU + P dV = u dV + V du + (u/3) dV.

As atomic energy levels and lines are not infinitely sharp but have some finite width, let Ni(V) dv = Ni<t>(V) dv be the number of atoms in state i that can absorb radiation in the frequency interval [v, v + dv], where, of course, [ <t>(v) dv = 1.

A rigorous derivation of formula (6.41) requires quantum electrodynamics; the non-relativistic limit is discussed in section 6.3.4. 6.31.4 A classical analogy The essence of formula (6.41) can already be grasped using classical arguments by equating the emission rate A j i h v to the average power radiated by a harmonic oscillator (see (1.97)). If x = xoe- iw1 is the time-variable coordinate of the electron and Po = exo its dipole moment, then P6 w4 Aji hv = 3e 3 . This yields (6.41) exactly if one puts JL = ~po and w = 2nv. Note that according to equation (6.41), Aji increases with the square of the dipole moment and with the third power of the frequency. We see from (6.41) that, cum granu salis, A ji is high for optical transitions and low at radio wavelengths. To get a feeling for the numbers, we apply the formula: (l) to an electronic transition in the hydrogen atom.

In other words, the transition probability is the product of the coupling constant of the electromagnetic radiation, ex, multiplied by the number of cells in the phase space divided by the crossing time. When the transition probability is expressed in this way, it can also be applied to other basic forces in the universe, besides electromagnetism. The coupling constant is then, of course, different. 6.3.2 Selection rules and polarization rules Formulae (6.41) and (6.42) incorporate the selection rules because when the integral (6.42) is zero for two eigenfunctions o/i and o/j (which is usually the case), the transition is forbidden. For instance, from that part of the eigenfunctions of the hydrogen atom which is radius-independent, namely follow the selection rules fl[ = ±1 flm = 0, ±1. If they are not fulfilled, no emission is possible. However, a perturbation, like an electric field, can make an otherwise forbidden line to become observable because the eigenfunctions are then deformed so that the integral (6.42) no longer vanishes. One can also derive the polarization rules in the presence of a magnetic field by separating the dipole moment JL of (6.41) into its Cartesian components, fLy = e f o/(Yo/j dV and evaluating the expressions. For example, when the field is in the z-direction and fLx = fLy = 0 but fLz =1= 0, the radiation is linearly polarized with its electric vector parallel to the applied magnetic field. 6.3.3 Quantization of the electromagnetic field So far we have learnt that radiative transitions occur at a rate given by the Einstein coefficients. Now we want to understand why they occur and how the As and Bs are computed. For this end, we have to quantize the electromagnetic field and we sketch how this can be done. 6.331 The spectrum of standing waves in a box Imagine a big box of volume V and length L with an electromagnetic field inside, consisting of standing waves.

Suppose a string has a length L, is fixed at its ends and vibrates exactly like the vector potential Ax of (6.43). As it vibrates, it bends and becomes distorted. Hooke's law of elasticity states how strong the internal deformations are: When we pull with a force F at the end of a rectangular block of length e and cross section a, the change in length de / e is proportional to the force per unit area, F / a = Y de / e, where the proportionality factor Y is Young's elasticity module. This law implies that the potential energy stored in the deformation of the volume element goes with (d€)2.

Naturally, we associate the oscillator of frequency Wj with radiation at that frequency and identify the quantum number n with the number of photons in the box at that frequency, more precisely, with the occupation number N, which is related to the radiative energy density U v through formula (5.33).

Here are the final results for the transition probability per unit time of an atom in a radiation field: • If exciting radiation is absent (s = 0), the transition probability P equals the Einstein A coefficient of (6.41), It is puzzling that a seemingly unperturbed atom in an eigenstate (above the ground state) with energy E j should emit radiation at all. One might expect it to stay there forever because the only time dependence in the eigenfunction is, from (6.17), an oscillation of the form e-iEjtjn. However, there are downward transitions (Aji > 0), even when the atom sits in the dark. The reason is that the perturbation operator (where the field is represented by eigenfunctions of an harmonic oscillator) does not vanish when photons are absent. • In a radiation field, the radiative density is, from (5.33), 2n 3 U v = -3W s. nc When there are many photons flying around, s emission rate is s + 1 and the induced The same expression holds for induced absorption (if the initial and final states of the atom have the same statistical weight).

(6.50) If U is constant, the general solution reads 1/J(x) = Ale iax + A2e- iax with complex Ai. There are two cases: ex = -Vs - U (6.51) • s - U > O. Then ex > 0 and the wave has an oscillatory behavior. It could be represented by a combination of a sine and a cosine. • s - U < O. Then iex is real and the two solutions correspond to an exponentially growing and declining function. The former is only allowed in finite intervals because the integral f 1/J*1/J dx must be bounded. If the potential U (x) is a step function, i.e. if it is constant over intervals [Xi, Xi+IJ but makes jumps at the connecting points Xi, with Xl < X2 < X3 < · .. , the wavefunction 1/J and its derivative 1/J' must be continuous at these points; otherwise the Schrodinger equation would not be fulfilled.

To find it is straightforward but often tedious. 6.4.2 Potential walls and Fermi energy If the particle is trapped in an infinitely deep well of length L, as depicted on the left-hand side of figure 6.3, the wavefunction must vanish at the boundaries. It cannot penetrate beyond the walls, not even a bit. The situation is reminiscent of a vibrating string fixed at its ends.

The neutrons do not disintegrate into protons and electrons, as one would expect, only a few do, because the energy liberated in the decay n --+ p + e produces only'\" 10 6 e V, which is miles below the Fermi threshold of (6.55) in a fictitious sea of electrons and protons at density 10 15 g cm- 3 . • The conduction electrons in a metal have values Tp between 10 4 and 10 5 K, so at temperatures T '\" 100 K, the energy distribution of the conduction electrons given by (5.26) is highly degenerate, only few of them are thermalized. For graphite particles of interstellar dust grains, the Fermi temperature is somewhat lower, Tp '\" 10 3 K. • Observing astronomers use both isotopes of liquid helium to cool their detectors. The 3He atoms are made of five elementary particles (two protons, one neutron and two electrons), they have half-integer spin and are fermions. The main isotope 4He, however, contains one more neutron, has zero total angular momentum and follows Bose statistics. The two isotopes show radically different behavior at low temperatures: 4He becomes a superfluid below 2.2 K, whereas 3He does not. Superfluidity is explicable by Bose statistics because Bose statistics allows many (even all) atoms to be at the lowest energy state. 6.4.3 Rectangular potential barriers 6.4.31 A single barrier Let a particle travel from the left to the right and encounter a potential wall, as in figure 6.4.

Then we make our first serious acquaintance with observations and examine the interstellar extinction curve (section 7.3). Its interpretation requires a basic knowledge of stellar photometry and the reddening law. In view of the overall cosmic abundance of elements, the extinction curve rules out major dust constituents other than silicate and carbon grains. We, therefore, proceed in section 7.4 to discuss their atomic structure and bonding. The shape of the extinction curve can only be explained if the grains are not of uniform dimension but display a size distribution. What kind of distribution and how it can be achieved in grain-grain collisions is sketched in section 7.5. Equipped with a quantitative idea about size and chemical composition of interstellar dust, we present typical and likely grain cross sections based on a reasonable set of optical constants. 7.1 Crystal structure 7.1.1 Translational synnnetry 7.1.1.1 The lattice and the base Interstellar grains probably contain crystalline domains of sizes 10 -1 00 A.

There is an infinite number of ways how to construct cells or vector triplets (a, b, e), even the choice of the primitive cell is not unique; figure 7.3 gives a two-dimensional illustration. Among the many possibilities, one prefers those cells whose sides are small, whose angles are the least oblique and which best express the symmetry of the lattice. These are called conventional, elementary or unit cells. For a full specification of a crystal, one needs besides the lattice points ua + vb + we, a description of the three-dimensional cell structure, i.e. of the distribution of charge and matter in the cell. The cell structure is called the base. The spatial relation between the lattice points and the base is irrelevant. So lattice points mayor may not coincide with atomic centers. A primitive cell may contain many atoms and have a complicated base but it always contains only one lattice point. 7.1.1.2 Physical consequences of crystalline symmetry Geometrically, the existence of a grid always implies spatial anisotropy because in various directions the structures are periodic with different spacings. Furthermore, the periodic arrangement of atoms are manifest by the morphological shape of the body; in non-scientific language: crystals are beautiful. The physical relevance of crystalline order reveals itself, among others, by • the appearance of long-range, i.e. intensified, forces which lead to sharp vibrational resonances observable at infrared wavelengths; • bonding strengths that are variable with direction: in one or two directions, a crystal cleaves well, in others it does not; and • a generally anisotropic response to fields and forces. For example, the way crystals are polarized in an electromagnetic field or stretched under mechanical stress depends on direction. 7.1.1.3 Miller's and other indices To find one's way around a crystal and to identify points, axes or planes, one uses the following notation: • If the origin of the coordinate system is at a cell corner, a point r xa + yb + ze within the cell is designated by xyz with x, y, z :s 1. For example, the cell center is always at ~ ~ ~ . • Suppose a plane intercepts the axes of the crystal coordinate system at the three lattice points uOO; OvO and OOw.

The plane (200) is parallel to (100) but cuts the a-axis at !a. • A direction within the lattice may be specified by an arrow that goes from the origin of the coordinate system to the point r = xa + yb + ze where x, y, z are integers. There is an infinite number of such vectors pointing in the same direction. Among them, let ua + vb + we be the one with the smallest integers u, v, w. The direction is then denoted by the triplet [uvw] in square brackets. In the cubic system (see later), the direction [uvw] is always perpendicular to the plane (hkl) with h = u, k = v and I = w. 7.1.2 Lattice types 7.1.2.1 Bravais cells and crystal systems In the general case, the lengths of the vectors a, b, e in the conventional cell and the angles between them are arbitrary. When lengths or angles are equal, or when angles have special values, like 90°, one obtains grids of higher symmetry. There are 14 basic kinds of translation lattices (Bravais lattices) which correspond to 14 elementary cells. These 14 lattice types can be grouped into seven crystal systems which are described in table 7.1 and shown in figure 7.1. The cubic system has the highest symmetry: a, b, e are orthogonal and their lengths are equal, a = b = c. The pol ariz ability is then isotropic, whereas for other crystal systems, it depends on direction. Figure 7.2 shows the three lattice types of the cubic family: simple (sc), body centred (bcc) or face centred (fcc) of which only the sc cell is primitive.

The translational symmetry is revealed from X-ray images and is described by the Bravais lattices. However, there are symmetry operations that also are evident on a macroscopic scale, such as the following ones. • Inversion at a center. If the center is in the origin of the coordinate system, the operation may be symbolized by r = - r'. • Rotation about an axis. One can readily work out that the only possible angles compatible with translational symmetry, besides the trivial 360°, are 60°, 90°, 120° and 180°. However, for a single molecule (not a crystal), other angles are possible, too. • Reflection at a plane. In each of these symmetry operations, there is a symmetry element that stays fixed in space (the inversion center, the rotation axis or the mirror plane, respectively). Macroscopically, a crystal has the shape of a polyhedron, like a gem in an ornament or the grains in the salt shaker. When one subjects it to a symmetry operation, the normals of the faces of the polyhedron do not change their directions. All crystals can be divided into 32 classes where each class represents a mathematical group whose elements are the symmetry operations described earlier. These 32 classes completely define the morphological (macroscopic) appearance of crystals. Macroscopic symmetry is, of course, the result of the microscopic structure, although the latter is not explicitly used in the derivation of the 32 crystal classes. Without proof, when the 14 Bravais lattices of the atomic world are combined with these symmetry elements, including two further symmetry elements (screw axis and glide plane), one arrives at 230 space groups. 7.1.2.3 Two-dimensionallattices The classification scheme is much simpler and easier to understand in two- dimensions. The basic unit of a two-dimensional crystal is a parallelogram. Now there are only five (translational) Bravais lattices and 10 crystal classes. When the Bravais lattices are combined with the symmetry elements permitted for a plane (rotation axis, mirror plane and glide plane), one obtains 17 planar space groups. The parallelograms of Bravais lattices may be • oblique (a =1= h, Y =1= 90°, figure 7.3); • hexagonal (a = h, y = 120°); • quadratic (a = h, y = 90°); • rectangular (a =1= h, y = 90°, figure 7.4); and • centered rectangular (a =1= h, y = 90°, figure 7.5).

The bonding is directional and follows the distribution of the electron density which has a significant high concentration between the atoms. One finds covalent binding in solids and in molecules. The wavefunctions in covalent bonding are not extended and only nearest neighbors interact. We sketch the simplest case which is presented by the Hi- molecule, although it contains only one electron, and not an electron pair. A stable configuration with two protons and one electron is possible only if the protons have the right distance and the electron cloud is properly placed between them. The motion of the protons can be neglected for the moment; it may be included afterwards as a correction and results in quantized vibrational and rotational states.

One therefore seeks 0/ in the form of the symmetric or anti-symmetric functions Here 0/1, 0/2 are the usual hydro genic wavefunctions with respect to proton 1 and 2 with energies E 1 = E2. The electron is either at proton 1 or 2, one cannot say at which. When the distance R between the protons is very large, there is degeneracy and the system has zero binding energy (Eb = 0). For smaller R, the degeneracy is removed. The electron is then in a double potential well and this leads to a splitting of energy levels. The analysis is completely analogous to the discussion of the double well in section 6.4.4. There is a binding (o/s) and an unbinding state (0/ a) and their separation increases as R becomes smaller. The lowering of the potential energy as a function of R is [Lan74] /';.E = 4XHRe- R - 1 when R is expressed in Bohr radii, ao, and XH denotes the ionization potential of hydrogen.

If the electron can spread out and be at two protons, as in the molecule Hi, more space is available to the electron and its momentum and the binding energy will be lower. The electronic wavefunctions and the electron energies are schemtically drawn in figure 7.7 for intermediate R. When one includes the repulsion among the protons and considers the full Hamiltonian (7.6), the binding energy of the Hi molecule has its minimum Eb = 2.65 eV at a distance of about two Bohr radii. This is the stable configuration of the molecule and Eb is the dissociation energy. When R is further reduced towards zero, repulsion between the protons dominates and the system is again unstable. 7.2.2 Ionic bonding In ionic or heteropolar bonds, the adhesion is due to long-range Coulomb forces. In a crystal, the ions of opposite sign attract and those of the same sign repel each other but in the end, attraction wins. At short distances, there is an additional kind of repulsion but it acts only between adjacent atoms. It results from Pauli's exclusion principle which restricts the overlap of electron clouds. Let us take a sodium chloride crystal (N aCl) as an example of ionic bonding. One partner, the alkali metal, is relatively easy to ionize (5.14 eV) and the other, the halogen Cl, has a high electron affinity (3.61 eV). Although the transfer of the electron from Na to Cl requires 5.14 - 3.61 = 1.53 eV, the Na+ and Cl- ions can supply this deficit. They can provide even more than that in the form of potential energy by coming close together. Indeed, at the equilibrium distance of 2.8 A, the binding energy per molecule equals 6.4 e V. As the ions of heteropolar bonds have acquired full electron shells, like inert gases, their electron clouds are fairly spherical and the charge distribution between the ions is low. Ionic bonding is, therefore, non-directional and usually"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"x 210 Structure and composition of dust \\ ; anti-binding , ' \" \" energy anti-binding binding Figure 7.7.

To estimate the binding energy of an ionic crystal, we write the potential CPi at the locus of atom i resulting from all other atoms j in the form (7.7) In the first term representing the interaction between ions of charge q, the plus sign refers to like, the minus sign to unlike charges and rij is the distance between them. The second term heuristically describes the repulsive potential at very close distance. Because its range p is only about one-tenth of the equilibrium separation reg between adjacent atoms, one can replace the second sum by n\"Ae- r / p , where n is the number of nearest neighbors and r the nearest- neighbor separation. The constants \"A and p have to be determined from quantum mechanical calculations or from experiment. We put Pij = rij / r and introduce the Madelung constant A = L (±). jf-i Pij (7.8) If atom i is negative, there is a plus sign when atom j is positive and a minus sign when it is negative.

It must obviously be positive as ~tot is negative; for NaCl, A = 1.748. Pure ionic bonding is, however, an idealization; one finds it neither in molecules nor in crystals. Even when compounding alkali metals with halogenes, there is some homopolar component or overlap of orbitals. In the extreme case of CsF, homopolar binding still amounts to 5%. There are also no pure covalent bonds, even in H2 or diamond, because of the fluctuations of the electron clouds. In the real world, there are only blends between the two bonding types. 7.2.3 Metals Another type of strong binding exists in metals. One may imagine a metal as a lattice of positive ions bathed in a sea of free electrons; metallic binding is therefore non-directional. 7.2.31 Sodium As as an example, we consider the alkali metal sodium (N a), the 11 th element of the Periodic Table with an electron configuration Is 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s l . The two inner shells are complete and the 3s valence electron is responsible for binding. In sodium metal, the 3s electrons form the conduction band. In an isolated sodium atom, the 3s electron is bound to the Na+ ion by an ionization energy XNa = 5.14 eY. The electron is localized near the atomic nucleus and its wavefunction 1/J goes to zero at large distances from the nucleus. When, however, the 3s electron is in the potential of a lattice of Na+ -ions, as in a metal, its wave function 1/J is very extended and subject to a different boundary condition: symmetry requires that the gradient of the wave function vanishes midway between atoms. The quantum mechanical calculations now yield a binding energy of the electron to the ionic lattice of 8.2 e Y. Because sodium has a density of 1.01 g cm- 3 , the concentration of 3s electrons is 2.65 x 10 22 cm- 3 and the Fermi energy after (6.54) Ep = 3.23 eY. From (6.54) also follows the density of states, E = dN = ~ (2m e )3/2 E1/2 p () dE 2n 2 fj,2 . The average energy (E) of a conduction electron, is therefore, (E) = N- 1 f pee) dE = ~Ep ::::: 1.9 eV. Consequently, in a metal each sodium atom is bound by 8.2 - XNa - 1.9 ::::: 1.16 eY."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"(7.9) 212 Structure and composition of dust 7.2.32 Conductivity and heat capacity The free and mobile electrons of a metal are responsible for the high electric conductivity. In a constant electric field E, they are accelerated but collide after an average time T with phonons (thermally oscillating atoms). The resulting current density J is equal to the charge density ne, where n is the number of free electrons per cm 3 , multiplied by their drift velocity v. An electron experiences an acceleration eE/me over an average time T, so that v = TeE/me. Because Ohm's law (1.112) asserts J = a E, the conductivity a is At very low temperatures, collisions of the electrons with lattice imperfections are more important than collisions with phonons. Because of free electrons, the heat capacity has a peculiar behavior at very low temperatures. Below the Debye temperature, which is typically several hundred K and thus not low, the specific heat C due to the lattice falls rapidly, like T 3 (see (8.39)). The heat capacity of the electron gas, however, declines less swiftly, it is proportional to T and, therefore, dominates at very low temperatures. Crudely speaking, when there are n free electrons per cm 3 , heating of the metal from zero Kelvin to temperature T thermally excites those conduction electrons which lie T degrees below the Fermi temperature Tp, altogether a fraction T /Tp. Their total mean energy is then U '\" nkT and, therefore, au nkT C = - '\" - ex: T. aT Tp For an exact relation, one has to use the Fermi distribution (5.37). 7.2.33 Energy bands and Bloch/unctions It is a general property of crystals that the electronic states are clustered in bands, with energy gaps between them. The basics of their formation was explained in section 6.4.3 on one-dimensional periodic potentials. To derive the energy states and eigenfunctions of an electron in the three-dimensional potential U (x), we first note that as U (x) comes from the lattice ions and is strictly periodic, it may, from (7.2), be written as U (x) = L UG e iGox G where the G are the reciprocal lattice vectors of (7.3). The general solution for the wavefunction ljJ(x) is sought in a Fourier expansion, ljJ(x) = L Ck eik-x k (7.10)"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Binding in crystals 213 where the wavenumber k fulfils the periodic boundary conditions and is connected to the momentum p by p=nk. The coefficients Ck are found by inserting (7.10) into the Schrodinger equation: [ A2 ] A P A Ho/(x) = - + U(x) o/(x) = Eo/(x) 2me (7.11) and solving the resulting set of algebraic equations. In (7.11), the interaction among electrons is neglected. After some algebra, one is led to Bloch's theorem, namely that the eigenfunction 1/Jk(x) for a given wavenumber k and energy Ek must have the form where Uk(X) is a function periodic with the crystal lattice. So if T is a translation vector as given in (7.1), then The wavefunction 1/Jk(x) itself does not generally display the periodicity. It is straight forward to prove Bloch's theorem in a restricted form, for a one- dimensional ring of N atoms, where after N steps, each of the size of the grid constant, one is back to the starting position. It is instructive to consider the formation of bands from the point of view of the tightly bound inner electrons of an atom. When we imagine compounding a solid by bringing N free atoms close together, the inner electrons are afterwards still tightly bound to their atomic nuclei, only their orbits have become disturbed. Because of the disturbance, a particular energy state Ei of an isolated atom will be split into a band of N substates due to the interaction with the other N - I atoms. The shorter the internuclear distance, the stronger the overlap of the wavefunctions and the broader the band; the energetically deeper the electrons, the narrower the band. There will be a Is, 2s, 2p, ... band. One can determine the energy states of a tightly bound electron by assuming that its wavefunction is a linear superposition of the atomic eigenfunctions. In this way, one finds the width of the band and the average energy in a band. The latter is lower than the corresponding energy in a free atom, which implies binding of the crystal. 7.2.4 van der Waals forces and hydrogen bridges The van der Waals interaction is much weaker than the bonding types discussed earlier and is typically only 0.1 eV per atom. It arises between neutral atoms or molecules and is due to their dipole moments. The dipoles have a potential U that rapidly falls with distance (U ex: r- 6 , see section 9.1)."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"214 Structure and composition of dust If the molecules do not have a permanent dipole moment, like C02, the momentary quantum mechanical fluctuations of the electron cloud in the neighboring atoms induces one; its strength depends on the polarizability of the molecules. This induced dipole moment is usually more important even for polar molecules. Its attraction holds C02 ice together and binds the sheets in graphite. Hydrogen can form bridges between the strongly electron-negative atoms N, o or F; the binding energy is again of order '\"'-'0.1 eV per atom. For example, when a hydrogen atom is covalently bound to oxygen, it carries a positive charge because its electron has been mostly transferred to the oxygen atom. The remaining proton can thus attract another negatively charged 0 atom. The double helix of the DNA is bound this way but so also is water ice. In solid H20, every oxygen atom is symmetrically surrounded by four others with hydrogen bonds between them. Because of these bonds, the melting and evaporation point of water is unusually high compared, for instance, to H2S, which otherwise should be similar as sulphur stands in the same Group VI of the Periodic Table right below oxygen. This thermodynamic peculiarity of water is crucial for the existence of life. 7.3 Reddening by interstellar grains Our knowledge of interstellar dust comes from the following measurements: • Interstellar extinction. The interstellar extinction or reddening curve specifies how dust weakens the light from background stars as a function of wavelength. • Dust emission. We receive this from all kinds of objects: protostars, old stars with shells, interstellar clouds and whole galaxies. • Infrared resonances. These are features observed in absorption and emission which allow us to identify the chemical components of the dust material. • Polarization. It refers to light from stars behind dust clouds but also to scattered radiation and dust emission. • Scattered starlight. Examples are reflection nebulae, the diffuse galactic light or the zodiacal light of the solar system. The items in italics are our five observational pillars. In this section, we are concerned with interstellar extinction and the clues it provides to dust properties, the other pillars are discussed elsewhere. We first describe the principles of stellar photometry because it is the basis for the reddening curve. 7.3.1 Stellar photometry The interstellar extinction curve is obtained from stellar photometry.

It was later expanded into the infrared; there the choice of wavelengths was dictated by the transmission of the atmosphere of the Earth. The observational bands are designated by letters: D, B, V, R, I, .... Table 7.2 lists their approximate center wavelengths A c and the conversion factors, WJc, for translating magnitudes into Jansky and back (see (7.14)). The precise effective observation wavelength follows only after convolving the spectrum of the source with the transmission of the instrument and the atmosphere. In photometry, especially at shorter wavelengths, it is customary to express the brightness of an object in apparent magnitudes. These are logarithmic quantities and they were appropriate units in the days when the human eye was the only detector because according to the psycho-physical rule of W Weber and G T Fechner: the subjective impression of the eye changes proportionally to the logarithm of the physical flux. But to the pride of many astronomers, magnitudes are still in use today. As they are laden with five millenia of history, only he who has thoroughly studied the 5000 year period can fully appreciate their scientific depth. An exhaustive explanation of magnitudes is, therefore, beyond the scope of this book. The brightest star of all, Sirius, has a visual apparent magnitude mv = -1.58 mag. Capella, Rigel and Vega are around zeroth and Spica (a Virginis) is only of first magnitude. Generally, a step of one up in magnitude means a factor of 2.5 down in observed flux.

At a distance of 10 pc, the apparent and absolute magnitude are, by definition, equal. When there is intervening dust, one adds, to the right-hand side of equation (7.12) a term AA to account for the weakening of starlight through interstellar extinction: m A - M A = 510g IO (;) - 5 + AA. (7.13) AA is related to the optical depth T A through AA = 1.086T A . The strange conversion factor of 1.086 between the two quantities arises from their definitions: stellar magnitudes are scaled by a factor of 2.5, the optical depth bye::::: 2.718. The term m - M in (7.12) is called the distance modulus. So ingenious astronomers have contrived a means to express length in stellar magnitudes. To convert a flux FA in Jy into an apparent magnitude m A or vice versa, we use the relation m A = 2.510g lO (;~) . (7.14) FA is expressed in Jy, W A is given in table 7.2. The formula is simple, the difficulty lies in the calibration factors W A • The values in the literature scatter by about 10% and, furthermore, they do not refer to identical center wavelengths because of the use of different filters. The magnitude difference between two bands is called the color. It is equivalent to the flux ratio at the corresponding wavelengths and thus determines the gradient in the spectral energy distribution. By definition, the colors of main sequence AO stars are zero. The most famous AOV star is ex Lyr (= Vega, D = 8.1 pc, mv = 0.03 mag, L = 54 L 0 ). Such stars have an effective temperature of about 9500 K and they can be approximated in the infrared by a blackbody. Indeed, if we calibrate the emission of a blackbody at 9500 K in the J band and put all colors to zero, we find the conversion factors wA(bb) listed in table 7.2. In the infrared, they are not very different from W A (adjacent column); however, the discrepancies are large at U, B and V because of the many absorption lines in the stellar spectrum that depress the emission relative to a blackbody. 7.3.2 The interstellar extinction curve 7.32.1 The standard color excess E B-V The interstellar extinction curve is obtained from photometry at various wavelengths A on two stars of identical spectral type and luminosity class, one"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"i = 1,2.

The difference in t.m at two wavelengths, A and A', gives the color excess E(A, A') = t.m(A) - t.m(A') = -[Tl(A) - Tl(A')] which no longer contains the distance D. At A = 0.44 !Lm and A' = 0.55 !Lm, the center wavelengths of the B and V band, the color excess is denoted by EB-V = E(B, V) and called the standard color excess. The band symbol is also used for the apparent magnitude, for example, V = mv or B = mB. The intrinsic color is denoted (B - V)o in contrast to the observed color B - V, which includes the effect of the selective weakening by interstellar dust. With this notation, we can write EB-V = (B - V) - (B - V)o and likewise for any other pair of wavelengths.

EB-V AB-AV TB-TV AA is the extinction in magnitudes at wavelength A; it is the result of absorption plus scattering but observationally one cannot separate the two.

The visual extinction in magnitudes A y, which also appears in the distance modulus of (7.13), is the most common quantity to characterize the opaqueness of a cloud. It is not a directly observable quantity. To obtain A y from photometry, one measures EB-y, assumes an Ry value and then uses (7.17). One can also express the reddening by dust through the mass extinction coefficient K A normalized at the V band. Because K A / Ky = TA/Ty, one gets T A Ext(A) -=--+1 Ty Ry (7.18) TA/Ty and Ext(A) are mathematically equivalent. Still other forms, containing the same information, are sometimes more suitable for displaying certain trends, for example, AA/ AJ (the J band is at 1.25 /Lm) or (AA - AJ)/(Ay - AJ). 7.32.3 Remarks on the reddening curve The interstellar extinction curve (figure 7.8) is observationally determined from about 0.1 to 10 /Lm. At longer wavelengths, the optical depth is small and the extinction of background light weak; moreover, the dust begins to emit itself. The reddening curve displays the following salient features: • In the diffuse interstellar medium, Ext(A) of equation (7.16) is, at optical and infrared wavelengths, fairly uniform over all directions in the sky and Ry equals 3.1; deviations occur only in the UV. • Towards clouds, however, the shape of the curve Ext(A) varies from one source to another, even in the infrared. The reduction in UV extinction for large Ry suggests that the small grains have disappeared. Photometric data exist only for cloud edges, their cores are too obscured. • The extinction curve refers to broad-band observations but nevertheless it is remarkably smooth. If one plots instead of Ext(A) the ratio TA/Ty then, to first order, all extinction curves look alike for A 2::. 0.55 /Lm; at shorter wavelengths, they can differ substantially. The curves are largely (but not totally) fixed over the entire wavelength range by the one parameter Ry of equation (7.17). The observed variations of Ry range from 2.1 to well over 5, the larger values being found towards molecular, the smaller ones toward high latitude clouds. • The only resonance in the extinction curve is the broad bump at 4.6 /Lm- I or 2175 A which is always well fit by a Drude profile. The central position of the bump stays constant from one star to another to better than 1 % implying that the underlying particles are in the Rayleigh limit (sizes < 100 A); however, its width varies (~A-I ::::: 1 ± 0.2 /Lm- I ). There is also scatter"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Reddening by interstellar grains 219 in the strength of the bump. It is correlated with Rv in the sense that the resonance is weak in clouds where Rv is large. A plausible explanation is coagulation of dust particles in clouds as a result of which the small grains disappear. • From the infrared to the hump at 2175 A, the extinction curve rises continuously. Over this range, stellar light is reddened because extinction decreases with wavelength. Beyond 2175 A, the ratio T)Jrv first declines and here the light is made bluer(!). In the far UV (A -I > 6 /Lm- I ), the curve rises again. • If one had good albedo measurements (which one does not have), one could subtract scattering from extinction to obtain a pure absorption curve. This would provide a touchstone for any dust model. • The two extinction curves in figure 7.8 suggest that the grains are modified when they change their environment. This should happen several times during their lifetime as they pass from dense into diffuse medium and back. The modifications may be due to energetic photons, condensation of gas atoms or collisions among grains. The latter would imply fluffy particles built up of smaller subunits (section 2.6). At higher spectral resolution, one finds superposed on the extinction curve diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs but they are not shown in figure 7.8). There are altogether more than a hundred, mainly between 0.4 and 0.9 /Lm, of variable strength, shape and width, the broadest being about 2 A wide. Although discovered 80 years ago, the identification of the DIBs is still unclear. 7.3.3 Two-color diagrams In two-colour-diagrams (TCDs), one plots one color against another. TCDs are a simple and efficient tool with which to separate distinct or identify similar astrophysical objects. As an example of a TCD, we show in figure 7.9 the UBV diagram of unreddened main sequence stars. All luminous stars of type BO or earlier cluster in a tight strip with B-V between -0.30 and -0.32 mag. The position in the UBV diagram of blackbodies with temperatures from 3500 to 40000 K is always well above the main sequence. So compared to a blackbody of the same color B- V, a stellar photosphere is much weaker at U. The reason for this behavior is that photoionization of the n = 2 level in hydrogen falls into the U-band. As this is the dominant process for the photospheric opacity at this wavelength, it greatly supresses the stellar flux. The characteristic wiggle in the main sequence line in figure 7.9 reflects the variation of this supression (called the Balmer decrement) with effective temperature. Interstellar reddening with the standard extinction law (Rv = 3.1) shifts any star in the UBV diagram from the main sequence in the direction parallel to the arrow of figure 7.9. The length of the shift is proportional to the foreground A v and in figure 7.9, it corresponds to Av = 5 mag. In the case of another extinction law, say, with Rv = 5, the slope and length of the arrow would be different"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"220 Structure and composition of dust 8 R v =5.0 4 6 ).. -1 [Jl-m -1] 2 Extinction curve - 5 L...-.L.-...L-....L.-.:....L...i....L.---L----1----JL...-.L..-...L.-....L.-....L..--'----L----1----JL....-.I.........J o Ol-\"\"\"+--+--+--'-+--+-I--+--+--+--+--+-I--+--+--+--+--+----l Ext()..) o 2 3 5 Figure 7.8.

This dereddening is unique as long as the star is of type B5 or earlier so that the reddening path does not intersect the wiggle of the main sequence curve. 7.3.4 Spectral indices Akin to a color is the spectral index, commonly defined in the infrared as dlog(AF)..)

Because at least half a percent of interstellar matter is in the solid phase, the dust can only consist of the most abundant elements, like C, N, 0, Fe, Si, or Mg. According to equations (7.23) and (7.25), the total dust volume in a column of 1 cm 2 cross section with Av = 1 mag is Vdust '\" 1.2 x 10- 5 cm- 3 , assuming a bulk density of 2.5 g cm- 3 . Considering the uncertainties, this is in agreement with the dust-to-gas ratio derived from the Kramers-Kronig relation in (2.95) but the method employed here is probably superior. How dusty is the interstellar medium? Very dusty! If the atmosphere of the Earth, which has a density p '\" 10- 3 g cm- 3 , had the same relative dust content, the optical depth T = ip K v would become unity over a distance of only i = 10 em and we could not see our feet! 7.4 Carbonaceous grains and silicate grains 7.4.1 Origin of the two major dust constituents Interstellar grains, at least their seeds, cannot be made in the interstellar medium, they can only be modified there or destroyed. Observational evidence points towards the wind of red giants on the asymptotic branch of the Hertzsprung- Russell diagram as the place of their origin (section 9.4). At first, tiny refractory nuclei are created in the inner part of the circumstellar envelope which then grow through condensation as they traverse the cooler outer parts (section 9.5). The type of dust that is produced depends on the abundance ratio of carbon to oxygen: • If there is less carbon than oxygen, [C]/[O] < 1, as in M-type and in OHIIR stars, no carbon is available for the solid phase because all C atoms are locked up in CO which is a diatomic molecule with an exceptionally strong bond. In such an environment, mainly silicates form, besides minor solid constituents like MgS, MgO and FeO. The observational characteristic of silicates is the presence of an Si-O stretching and an O-Si-O bending mode at 9.8 /Lm and 18 /Lm, respectively. Silicon has a cosmic abundance [Si] / [H] = 3 x 10- 5 , it is heavily depleted in the gas phase (depletion factor !depl (Si) '\" 30), so almost all of it resides in grains. • If [C]/[O] > 1, as in C-type stars (these are carbon-rich objects like C, R, N stars), carbonaceous grains form."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Carbonaceous grains and silicate grains 225 Carbon has a cosmic abundance [C]/[H] = 4 x 10- 4 , or somewhat less, and a depletion factor !depl(C) '\" 3. Two out of three atoms are built into solids, one is in the gas phase. There are several forms of carbonaceous grains: mainly amorphous carbon, graphite and PAHs. Carbon and silicates are the major constituents of interstellar dust. Other types of grains, for whose existence there are either observational or theoretical indications, include metal oxides (MgO, FeO, Fe304, Ah03), MgS and SiC. The last substance, silicon carbide, is only seen in C-stars through its emission signature at 11.3 /Lm but it is not detected in the interstellar medium. Generally, interstellar grains are beyond the reach of spacecraft, because of their distance, so they cannot be brought to Earth and studied in the laboratory. However, as the Sun moves relative to the local interstellar cloud (it is of low density, nH '\" 0.3 cm- 3 ), dust particles of this cloud sweep through the solar system. Some of them were detected by spacecraft at the distance of Jupiter and identified as belonging to the local interstellar cloud by the direction and value (\"'26 km S-I) of their velocity vector [Grii94]. In the process of detection they were destroyed. Their masses, which could also be determined, correspond to /Lm-sized grains which we think are rather atypical for the interstellar medium. Smaller grains are probably prevented from penetrating deep into the solar system by radiation pressure and, if they are charged, by the interplanetary magnetic field. In interplanetary dust particles and in primitive meteorites which have been collected on Earth, one can identify inclusions which distinguish themselves by their isotopic pattern from the solar system. Because the isotopic abundance ratios are explainable in terms of nucleosynthesis in AGB stars or supernovae, these subparticles are hypothesized to be of interstellar origin. If so, they have probably undergone considerable reprocessing in the solar nebula. 7.4.2 The bonding in carbon Carbon, the sixth element of the periodic system, has four electrons in its second (n = 2) uncompleted shell: two s-electrons denoted as 2s 2 with angular momentum quantum number I = 0 and two unpaired p-electrons (2p 2) with I = I, in units of n. The ground state of carbon is designated 3Po. It is a triplet (prefix 3) with total spin S = I, total orbital angular momentum L = I (letter P) and total (including spin) angular momentum J = 0 (suffix 0). In the ground state, there are only two unpaired p-electrons. However, one 2s-electron may be promoted to a 2p orbital and then all four electrons in the second shell become unpaired; this is the chemically relevant case where carbon has four covalent bonds. The promotion requires some energy (4.2 eV) but it will be more than returned in the formation of a molecule. The bonding of carbon to other atoms is of the covalent type and there are two kinds:"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"226 Structure and composition of dust • In a a-bond, the electron distribution has rotational symmetry about the internuclear axis. • In a Jr-bond, the wavefunction of the two electrons has a lobe on each side of the internuclear axis. The s and p wavefunctions can combine linearly resulting in hybrid orbitals. The combination of one s and three p electrons is denoted as an Sp3 hybrid, likewise there are sp2 and sp hybrids. Here are examples: • In methane, CH4, the coupling of carbon is completely symmetric to all four H atoms and the difference between s and p valence electrons has disappeared. In the identical hybridized Sp3 orbitals, the C-H binding is through a-bonds. They point from the C atom at the center of a tetrahedron towards the H atoms at its corners. The angle ex between the internuclear axes follows from elementary geometry, one gets cos ex = - ~, so ex = 109.5°. • The situation is similar in ethane, H3C-CH3, although the symmetry is no longer perfect. Each of the two C atoms has again four Sp3 hybrid orbitals connecting to the other carbon atom and to the neighboring three hydrogen atoms. Because of the a-bond between the two Cs, the CH3 groups can rotate relative to each other (see figure 7.12). • An sp2 hybrid is present in ethylene, H2C-CH2, which is a planar molecule, where the angle from Cover C to H equals 120°. There are a -bonds between C-H and C-c. But the two remaining 2p orbitals in the carbon atoms, besides the sp2 hybrids, overlap to an additional Jr-bond, so altogether we have a C=C double bond (one a and one Jr), which makes the CH2 groups stiff with respect to rotation (see figure 7.13). • In the linear molecule acetylene, HC-CH, the C atoms are sp hybridized yielding C-C and C-H a-bonds. There are two more Jr-bonds, whose orbitals are perpendicular to each other and to the internuclear axis; in total, the carbon atoms are held together by a triple bond, C=c. Acetylene is believed to be the basic molecule for the nucleation of carbonaceous grains in the wind of giant stars (see figure 7.14). • Benzene, C6H6, is an especially simple and symmetric hydrocarbon (a so called PAH, see later). In this planar ring (aromatic) molecule, each carbon atom has three sp2 hybrid orbitals connecting through a-bonds to the adjacent two C atoms and one H atom. There is still one unhybridized 2p electron per C atom left. The carbon atoms are sufficiently close together so that neighboring 2p orbitals can pair to form an additional Jr-bond; the p-orbitals are perpendicular to the plane. Because of the complete symmetry of the ring, the unhybridized electrons in the 2p-orbitals are not localized but equally shared (resonant) in the ring. So, on average, two adjacent C atoms are coupled by a a-and half a Jr -bond. The binding is therefore intermediate in strength between a single and a double bond. The more bonds between two C atoms there are, the stronger they are bound and the shorter their internuclear distance (see figure 7.15)."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Carbonaceous grains and silicare grains 227 ethane cr(Cs 3,CS 3) Figure 7,12.

The bonding in diamond is strong (7.3 eV per atom) and due to its overall bonding isotropy, diamond is extremely hard with hardness number 10; diamond is used for cutting and drilling. The stiffness of the bonds also explains the exceptionally high thermal conductivity (several times greater than that of copper). As there are no free electrons, diamond is electrically insulating. On Earth, diamonds are formed under high pressure and temperature at a depth of about 200 km. They are mined in Kimberlite pipes which are vents associated with volcanoes where the deep material is transported upwards so that it can be reached by man. The upward transport during the volcano eruption occurs sufficiently rapid without a phase transition. In fact, diamond is not in equilibrium at the conditions at the surface of the Earth, it is metastable in our environment but well separated by a large activation barrier from graphite, which is the energetically lower phase. So diamonds are long lasting presents that will outlive the affluent donors as well as the pretty recipients of the gems. Big raw diamonds are cleft parallel to octahedral crystal faces.

Diamond grains are also found in meteorites but they are extremely small (\"'30 A), so that not a negligible fraction of C atoms is at the surface. They contain many H atoms and their density p is considerably lower than in perfect crystals for which p = 3.51 g cm- 3 . The origin of the meteoritic diamonds is unclear but probably interstellar (carbon stars, supernovae, interstellar shocks?). 7.4.32 Graphite Carbon atoms combine also to planar structures conslstmg of many C6 hexagonals. The distance between adjacent C atoms is 1.42 A, the angle between them 120°. The bonding is similar to that in benzene as again the 7T -bonds are not localized in the rings and the electrons of the unhybridized 2p orbitals are free to move in the plane. This mobility endows graphite with an electric conductivity within the sheets. Graphite consists of such C6 sheets put on top of each another. The stacking is arranged in such a way that above the center of an hexagon in the lower sheet there is always a C atom in the upper one. The distance from one sheet to the nextis 3.35 A (figure 7.16). The sheets are only weakly held together by van der Waals forces. Therefore, graphite cleaves well along these planes and owing to this property, its name is derived from the Greek word for writing: when gently pressing a pen over a piece of paper, tiny chunks peel off to form sentences of rubbish or wisdom, depending on who is pressing. Graphite has a density of 2.23 g cm- 3 and a very high sublimation temperature (T ev > 2000 K at interstellar pressures). We reckon that in interstellar space about 10% of the carbon which is in solid form is graphitic. 7.4.33 PAHs A polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, briefly PAH, is a planar compound made up of not too large a number of aromatic (C6) rings (chapter 12). At the edge, hydrogen atoms are attached but only sporadically; the coverage need not be complete, as in benzene. Possibly one finds at the periphery also other species, besides hydrogen, like OH or more complex radicals. PAHs are unambiguously identified in the interstellar medium and account for a few percent by mass of the interstellar dust. A fascinating kind of PAHs are fullerenes. The most famous, C60, has the shape of a football. It is made of 12 pentagons (Cs), which produce the curvature, and 20 hexagons (C6). The diameter of the spheres is \"'7.1 A. Fullerines do not contain hydrogen. Their existence in interstellar space is hypothetical. 7.4.34 Amorphous carbon Diamond and graphite are very regular (crystalline).

Right: Other chain types are realized in silicates, too; here a double chain where more than one 0 atom per tetrahedron is shared (amphiboles). Most interstellar carbon grains are probably amorphous (ae).

Note that whereas the n -band is filled, the n* -band is empty and responsible for electric conduction. The assignment of the 4.6 jLm- 1 hump to n --+ n* transitions is, however, controversial because of the overall messy character of the binding in carbon with its multitude of hard-to- identify bonds. 7.4.4 Silicates 7.4.4.1 Silicon bonding and the origin of astronomical silicates Silicon stands right below carbon in Group IV of the Periodic Table. Its inner two shells are filled, in the third (n = 3) it has, like carbon, two s and two p electrons (3s 2 3p 2 configuration). The ground state is also 3Po. There are two basic reasons why silicon is chemically different from carbon. First, it takes more energy to promote an s electron in order that all four electrons become available for covalent bonding. Second, silicon atoms are bigger, so their p orbitals cannot come together closely enough to overlap and form a n-bond. Therefore, there are no silicon ring molecules and double bonding (Si=Si) is rare (it involves d- electrons). The dust particles formed in oxygen-rich atmospheres are predominantly silicates. Silicates consist of negatively charged Si04 groups in the form of tetrahedra with a side length of 2.62 A. They are the building blocks which form an ionic grid together with positively charged Mg and Fe cations. We may idealize an Si04 tetrahedron as an Si 4 + ion symmetrically surrounded by four 0 2 - ions; however, there is also substantial covalent bonding in the tetrahedron. 7.4.4.2 Coordination number It is intuitively clear that the relative size of adjacent atoms in a crystal is important for the crystal structure. Let us define r = ratio of the radii of neighboring atoms. In silicates, the radius of the central Si 4 + ion is 0.41 A and much smaller than the radius of the 0 2 - ion which is 1.40 A, therefore, r = 0.41/1.4::::: 0.3. This implies, first, that oxygen fills basically all the volume and, second, that the coordination number N of a Si 4 + ion, which is the number of its nearest equal neighbors, is four. In other crystals, r is different. The coordination number and the coordination polyhedron for the limiting values of r, which assumes that the ions are hard spheres touching each other, are summarized in table 7.3. For crystals with 0.23 < r :s 0.41, the coordination number N equals 4 and the nearest neighbors form a tetrahedron; for 0.41 < r :s 0.73, one has N = 6 and an octahedron as coordination polyhedron.

The basic silicate types are determined by the following criteria: • No oxygen atom is common to two tetrahedrons. The latter are then isolated islands. The prototype is olivine (Mg,FehSi04 which belongs to the orthorhombic crystal family. By writing (Mg,Fe), one indicates that magnesium is often replaced by iron. To visualize the three-dimensional structure of this mineral, imagine that each Mg2+ or Fe2+ cation lies between six 0 atoms of two independent tetrahedra. These six 0 atoms are at corners of an octahedron around the cation. The ratio r of the ionic radius of the metal cations to that of 0 2 - is about 0.5. Because the 0 atoms are so big, they form approximately an hexagonal close packed structure (figure 7.17). • One, two, three or even all four oxygen atoms are shared with neigboring tetrahedra. We mention bronzite, (Mg,Fe)Si03, also of the orthorhombic crystal family (the form without Fe is called enstatite, MgSi03). In this mineral, there are chains of Si04 tetrahedra in which two 0 atoms are common to neighboring units. The repeating unit has the formula [Si03]2-. 7.4.5 A standard set of optical constants We have learnt in this section what dust is made of. We can now proceed to present a reasonable set of optical constants meA) for the two major interstellar solid substances, amorphous carbon and silicate. The wavelength ranges from 0.03 to 2000 /Lm, which is a sufficiently broad interval for most applications. We will call these data our standard set and it may be used as a benchmark for comparison between dust models. For some applications, one also needs m (A) for the two minor solid constituents: graphite and PAHs (section 12.4). Optical constants vary with time; at least, in the literature they are.

A single grain radiates according to Kirchhoff's law and we strictly derive this law in section 8.1 under the assumption that a grain consists of an ensemble of coupled harmonic oscillators in thermal equilibrium. In section 8.2, we show how to compute the temperature to which a grain is heated in a radiation field and add a few common examples as well as useful approximation formulae. Section 8.3 illustrates the emission of grains for a typical dust type; it also presents a first example of radiative transfer, for a dust cloud of uniform temperature. For evaluating the emission of very small grains, which are those whose temperature does not stay constant, we have to know the specific heat and the internal energy of the dust material. We, therefore, investigate, in section 8.4, the calorific properties of dust. Finally, section 8.5 presents examples of the emission of very small grains. 8.1 Kirchhoff's law 8.1.1 The emissivity of dust A grain bathed in a radiation field acquires an equilibrium temperature Td which is determined by the condition that it absorbs per second as much energy as it emits. According to Kirchhoff, in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) the ratio of the emission coefficient tv to the absorption coefficient K~bs is a function of temperature and frequency only. This discovery had already been made in the 19th century; later it was found that tv/ K~bs equals the Planck function. Of course, a grain in interstellar space is not at all in an LTE environment. But whenever it is heated, for example by a photon, the excess energy is very rapidly distributed among the very many energy levels of the grain and the resulting distribution of energy states is given by the Boltzmann function and depends only on the dust temperature, Td. Therefore, grain emission is also only a function of Td and, as in LTE, given by (8.1) 239"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"240 Dust radiation The emission over all directions equals 4lTtv. The quantity tv is called the emissivity. It can refer to a single particle, a unit volume or a unit mass. The dimensions change accordingly. For example, the emissivity tv per unit volume is expressed in erg S-I cm- 3 Hz- I steel. 8.1.2 Thermal emission of grains To understand how and why an interstellar grain emits according to equation (8.1), we assume that it consists of N atoms and approximate it by a system of f = 3N - 6 (see section 8.4.2) weakly-coupled one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, each of mass mi and resonant frequency Wi. Classically, the total energy E of the system is (8.2) and consists of kinetic (Ekin), potential (V) and interaction (H') energy. The latter is small compared to Ekin and V but it must not be neglected altogether. Otherwise the oscillators would be decoupled and unable to exchange energy at all: starting from an arbitrary configuration, equilibrium could never be established. In (8.2), qi and Pi denote coordinates and momenta. In the thermal (canonical) description, the level population of the quantized harmonic oscillators is described by a temperature T. The ith oscillator has levels Vi = 0, I, 2, ... and can make transitions of the kind Vi --+ Vi - I. If the energy difference is lost radiatively, a photon of frequency Vi escapes. The probability Pi,v of finding the ith oscillator in quantum state V is given by the Boltzmann equation (5.8): e- t3hVi (v+!J p, - - [I - e-t3hVi]e-vt3hvi I,V - Z(T) - with the partition function Z(T) from (5.10) and f3 = l/kT.

(8.4) All one has to know is ALo' the coefficient for the ground transition. Note that for an ideal harmonic oscillator there is no upper limit to its maximum energy and Vi is the same for all levels v, whereas a real oscillator has a maximum energy above which the system is unbound and only its lowest levels are approximately energetically equidistant; towards the boundary their spacing decreases. To compute the total emission per solid angle of oscillator i, we sum up over all levels v 2: 1, lOth(i) = L lOth(i, v). v::c:1 Because of the mathematical relations (A.I6), we obtain .

When we combine the two formulae, we retrieve Kirchhoff's law (8.1). Note that the absorption coefficient K~i' which is taken with respect to a particular pair of levels (v, v-I), still contains the temperature via f3 = 1/ kT. However, the radiation of frequency Vi interacts with all level pairs and in the total absorption coefficient K Vi the temperature has disappeared. Also note that K Vi does include stimulated emission because it is incorporated into the formula for K~i; however, the typical factor (1 - e-hvi! kT) has canceled out. 8.1.4 Equipartition of energy We conclude with remarks on the distribution of energy under equilibrium conditions. Let us first consider a gas where the atoms are unbound. A gas of N atoms possesses 3N degrees of freedom and each degree of freedom has an average energy (E) = !kT. As the atoms have only kinetic energy, altogether E tot = Ekin = ~ NkT . When the atoms are not free but bound to their neighbors by electric forces, as in a solid, there is, rather interestingly, the same average kinetic energy !kT. Furthermore, there is also potential energy V. The total energy E tot is now twice as large as for a gas and evenly split between V and Ekin: E tot = Ekin + V = 3NkT. Quite generally, thermal equilibrium implies equipartition of energy when for each particle i of the system the kinetic energy is quadratic in its momentum Pi and the potential energy is quadratic in its space coordinate qi, and when the total energy of the rest of the system, E', depends neither on Pi nor qi. Then the total energy E of the system, including particle i, can be written as E = ap~ + bq~ + E'. The mean kinetic energy, (ap~) of particle i is found by averaging ap~ over the phase space with the Boltzmann distribution as the weight: Likewise, one finds (bqf) = !kT.

Therefore, it holds only for classical systems or, equivalently, at high temperatures. When T is small and the energy levels are quantized, (E) =1= ~kT. Different oscillators, although in thermal equilibrium, then have different mean energies equal to hv/(ehvjkT - I) after (5.11). 8.2 The temperature of big grains 8.2.1 The energy equation Equation (8.1) permits us, in a straightforward way, to calculate the dust temperature Td from the balance between radiative heating and radiative cooling: f K~bs Iv dv = f K~bs Bv(Td) dv. K ~bs is the mass (or volume) absorption coefficient of dust at frequency v, and Iv is the average of the radiation intensity over all directions. For spherical grains, our standard case, of radius a and absorption efficiency Q~bs(a), (8.8) If other forms of heating or cooling are relevant, for instance, by collisions with gas particles, they have to be added in equations (8.7) and (8.8). We neglect them for now. It is evident from (8.8) that it is not the absolute value of Q~bs that determines the dust temperature in a given radiation field Iv. Two efficiencies, Q~~~ and Q2~~' that differ at all frequencies by an arbitrary, but constant factor, yield exactly the same Td. Qualitatively speaking, a grain is hot when Q~bs is high at the wavelengths where it absorbs and low where it emits. 8.2.2 Approximate absorption efficiency at infrared wavelengths When one wants to determine the dust temperature from equation (8.8), one first has to compute the absorption efficiency Q~bs(a) for all frequencies from Mie theory and then solve the integral equation for Td. These procedures require a computer. However, there are certain approximations to Q~bs which allow us to evaluate Td analytically, often with only a small loss in accuracy. For a quick and often sufficiently precise estimate, one exploits the fact that dust emits effectively only in the far infrared where the Rayleigh limit is valid. According to (3.3), the absorption efficiency Q~bs of spheres is then proportional to the size parameter 277: a / 'A multiplpied by a function that depends only on frequency.

In a given radiation field, a blackbody is usually colder than any other object. But this is not a law, one can construct counter examples. If a blackbody is heated by a star at distance rand bolometric luminosity L, its temperature follows from (8.13) For example, we find that a blackbody r astronomical units from the Sun heats up to ( r )-1/2 T = 279 AU K.

The equation is applicable as long as the grain diameter stays below'\" I /Lm, which is usually true in the interstellar medium. According to (8.14), the heating rate of a grain and, in view of equilibrium, also its total emission rate are proportional to TJ. Consequently, a moderate temperature difference implies a vast change in the energy budget. For example, to warm a particle, or a whole dust cloud, from 20 to 30 K requires a tenfold increase in flux. To determine Td in (8.14), it remains to evaluate the integral on the left.

If the particles are very small so that the Rayleigh limit is applicable to both emission and absorption, i.e. to either side of (8.8), the radius a in the absorption efficiency Q~bs(a) cancels out (see (3.3)) and all tiny grains of the same chemical composition have the same temperature. If the grains are big, much bigger than the particles found in interstellar space, Q~bs (a) in (8.8) becomes independent of size and the grain temperature levels off to some limit, Tlim. This value is similar but not identical to that of a blackbody, Tbb, because Q~bs stays under the integrals in (8.8) and is not constant. As an example, we compute grain temperatures near a luminous star and in the interstellar radiation field (ISRF). By the latter we mean the environment in the solar neighborhood but outside clouds and not close to any star, rather in the space between the stars.

To find the eigenfrequencies of the oscillators, one uses normal coordinates. If there are N mass points in the grain, we describe their positions by one vector in Cartesian coordinates, n = 3N. At the equilibrium position, designated xo, all forces exactly balance, so the derivatives of the potential V (x) vanish, G~)xo = O. We introduce coordinates relative to equilibrium, IJi = Xi - XiO and put V (xo) = 0, which is always possible. If the oscillations are small, one can approximate the potential by a Taylor expansion.

Let all atoms be of the same mass m, with a constant distance d between them when they are at rest, and connected through springs of force constant K. Let us consider a longitudinal wave. The force on any mass point depends then only on the distance to its nearest neighbors on the left and right. It is straightforward to derive the dispersion relation 2 2K W = -[I - cos(kd)] m (8.26) where k = 277:/ A is the wavenumber and A the wavelength.

The dispersion relation reads wi = m~ [M + m ± JM2 + m 2 + 2mM COS(2kd)] (8.27) where the minus sign refers to the acoustic and the plus sign to the optical branch. 8.4.2 Internal energy of a grain A point-like unbound atom has three degrees of freedom corresponding to the three independent spatial coordinates along which it can move.

It is, of course, normalized: 1 00 P(T) dT = 1. (8.46) In normal interstellar grains of average size, the temperature oscillates only a little around an equilibrium value T eq and in the limit of large grains, P(T) approaches the 8-function 8(T eq ), where T eq follows from the steady-state balance between emission and absorption from (8.8), Even for a very small particle we will assume that its radiation, at any time, obeys Kirchhoff's law (8.1), so in the case of a sphere of radius a, we can express its average monochromatic emission per solid angle by (8.47) Although the emission of such a single grain is not constant over time, the whole ensemble radiates at any frequency at a steady rate. We are faced with the problem of finding P(T) and we describe below its solution (an elaborate treatment can be found in [Guh89] and [DraOl]). 8.5.2 The transition matrix When a grain absorbs or emits a photon, its internal energy U (T), which is a function of temperature only, changes.

They occur at a rate N Pi A f i, where the matrix element A fi denotes the transition probability that a single grain changes from state i to f.

To find the probability density peT) required in equation (8.47), one may first put PI = I, solve (8.48) for P2, ... , PN and then rescale the Pj by the obvious condition that all probabilities must add up to one (see (8.46)), (8.49) A matrix element Akj referring to dust heating (j < k) is equal to the number of photons of frequency Vk - v j which a grain absorbs per Hz and second multiplied by the width of the final bin ~ Vk, j < k.

As it should be, the number of transitions Pj Akj from j --+ k is thus proportional to the width of the initial (via Pj) and final energy bins.

As cooling proceeds via infrared photons which have low energy, their emission changes the grain temperature very little.

In fact, in practical applications it suffices to ignore cooling transitions with j --+ k < j - 1. One can, therefore, put all matrix elements A f i above the main diagonal to zero, except Aj-l,j. But the latter, in order to fulfil the energy equation, have to be written as (8.52) The total matrix A fi has thus acquired a new form where, above the main diagonal, only the elements A fi with f = i-I are non-zero.

Therefore, it is good to know when such calculations are necessary. Generally speaking, they should be carried out whenever the time interval between the absorption of photons with an energy comparable to the heat capacity of the grain is larger than the cooling time. Unfortunately, this is not very"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"266 Dust radiation practical advice. However, we will present examples that give some feeling for when temperature fluctuations are important and how they modify the spectrum. Qualitatively, there are three requirements for temperature fluctuations to occur: • The radiation field is hard to ensure the presence of energetic photons. We are purposely vague about what is meant by hard but one may think of the UVrange. • The grains are tiny so that their heat capacity is small. • The radiation field is weak to make the intervals between capture of energetic photons long. This point is counterintuitive but is exemplified in figure 8.13. Evaluating the probability density P(T) when temperature fluctuations are small is not only unnecessary but can also incur numerical difficulties. Whenever the function P (T) becomes very sharp, it suffices to calculate the radiation of the particle from (8.1) with a constant temperature from (8.8). To minimize the computational effort, especially in problems of radiative transfer, one has to avoid a large transition matrix A fi and properly select the energy bins. As P(T) varies strongly with hardness and strength of the radiation field as well as with particle size, a good grid is sometimes not easy to find. The boundaries of the grid, Umin and U max , are hard to determine beforehand and intuitive values like Umin = 0 and U max = hv max are often not adequate. An iterative procedure is, therefore, recommended: starting with a first choice that crudely brackets the maximum of P(T), one can find a better adapted grid by using as new boundaries those values of T where P(T) has dropped by some large factor (for instance, 10 12 ) from its maximum. An indicator for the computational accuracy, but not a precise one, is the time-averaged ratio of emitted over absorbed energy which must, of course, equal one. Generally, a grid of 100 energy bins is sufficient provided they are properly selected. The simplest grid has a constant mesh size, either in temperature or energy. Because U ex: rei with 0 :s ex :s 3, a grid of constant ~ T seems to be better suited than one with constant ~ U, as the former has at low temperatures a finer spacing in energy to handle the infrared photons. 8.5.4 The stochastic time evolution of grain temperature The probability density P(T) describes the steady-state temperature distribution of a large ensemble of grains. The temperature of an individual particle, however, is time variable. Radiative cooling is not balanced at every instant by heating and so the internal energy U changes for a spherical grain of radius a according to the first-order differential equation: ~~ = 4n na 2 { f Q~bs Iv(t)dv - f Q~bSBv(T(t))dV}. The right-hand side describes the difference between the power absorbed from the radiation field Iv and the cooling rate. Replacing U by the specific heat"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Temperature fluctuations of very small grains 267 (8.54) C(T) (see (8.35)), we may write ~~ = 4~(;~2 {f Q~bsJv(t)dv- f Q~bSBv(T(t))dV}. Given a starting value To at t = 0, this ordinary differential equation yields the time evolution of the temperature, T (t). One must, however, take into account that the electromagnetic field is quantized, although its time-averaged flux is constant. To make equation (8.54) easier, we assume that the cooling rate, i.e. the flux of emitted low-energy infrared photons, is continuous. Most of the grain heating, however, occurs sporadically through absorption of individual energetic photons (> leV) and leads to temperature jerks. To solve (8.54) numerically from t = 0 until t = T, we proceed as follows. The total period T is divided into small time steps /';.t and the total frequency range into intervals /';. Vj = Vj+l/2 - Vj-l/2. The number of photons with frequency /';. Vj that are absorbed within each time step equals J(v') Qabs(v') N.=/';.t.4nna 2 J J /';.v'. J hv' J J For short time steps /';.t, the Nj are much smaller than one and represent also the probability for photon capture.

Ui that accounts for the stochastically absorbed photons during the new interval /';.t; the temperature is increased accordingly by /';. Ti. To incorporate the quantum character of the photons, /';. Ui is written as /';.Ui = Lajhvj j where the a j are either one or zero. They are computed from Nj with a random number generator. The chance that a j = I is Nj, the probability that a j = 0 equals I - Nj.

For each time step, one thus gets a temperature. When the evolution of the temperature, T (t), has been laboriously evaluated from (8.54), the probability density P(T) follows from counting how many times during the period T the temperature attains values in the interval T ... T + dT. These numbers are then normalized according to (8.46). The emissivity tv can be computed as an average over time T, na21' abs tv = - Q v Bv(T(t)) dt.

They may either rebounce from the grain surface or stick. In equilibrium, the number of accreted atoms per unit time is equal to the number of atoms leaving the grain. Gas accretion has great astronomical consequences as the following examples demonstrate. • The transfer of energy from gas to dust and back which may strongly influence the temperature of the components. • A change in the optical properties of the grains and thus their emission characteristics. • The depletion of molecular species in the gas phase as they freeze out on the grains. Such species may not then be observable, whereas otherwise they would be strong emitters and important coolants. • The formation of new molecules. Accretion of H atoms is the only way in which molecular hydrogen can be made at all in relevant quantities.

The growth rate da/dt of the grain radius should be independent of a, as the impinging atoms do not see the grain curvature. Therefore, the matter will mostly accrete on the small dust particles as they have the larger total surface area. Consequently, large grains hardly grow any bigger through accretion, although the mean grain size, which is the average over the total distribution, increases. 9.1.2 Physical adsorption and chemisorption 9.1.2.1 The van der Waals potential To describe the collision between an atom on the grain surface and an approaching gas atom, we first derive their interaction potential. Both atoms are electrically neutral but have dipole moments: let PI refer to the surface and P2 to the gas atom. A point charge q in an external electrostatic potential ¢, which is given by some fixed far away charges, has at position Xo the electrostatic potential energy U = q¢(xo). If instead of the point charge q there is, localized around xo, a charge distribution p(x), the energy becomes U = f p(x) ¢(x) dV."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Grain surfaces 277 Expanding ¢(x) to first order around xo, ¢(x) = ¢(xo) + x· V¢(xo) = ¢(xo) - x· E(xo) and substituting the expansion into the volume integral for U, we obtain U = q¢(xo) - P . E(xo) where we have used the general definition (1.2) of a dipole p. In our case of colliding atoms, the effective charge q vanishes. Suppose the field E(x) is due to the dipole Pion the grain surface; E(x) is then described by (3.10). Denoting by r the vector from PI to P2, we get PI .

But when the two dipoles are very close, a repulsive interaction sets in because the electrons tend to overlap and Pauli's exclusion principle forbids them to occupy the same quantum state. This potential bears a more empirical character and changes with distance even more abruptly, like l/r I2 . The net result of the combination between repulsion and attraction is (9.7) with Da 6 = api. The parameter D defines the strength of the potential and a its range. U (r) becomes infinite for r --+ 0, changes sign at s = a, reaches its minimum value - D at r = ~a and remains negative as it approaches zero for r --+ CXJ (figure 9.1). In a collision of an atom with the grain surface, one has to include the contribution from all force centers, i.e. atoms on the grain surface. On a regular surface, the potential attains minima at various locations privileged by symmetry. For a simple or body centered cubic lattice, these minima are at the mid-points between four neighboring surface atoms (see figure 7.2)."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"278 Dust and its environment U(r) 0.4 0.2 o -0.2 I - - D \\ - I 012 internuclear distance r / a Figure 9.1.

The minimum is at r = --V2(J and U(r) = -D. 9.1.2.3 Physical and chemical binding Physical adsorption is rather weak; it needs typically only 0.1 eV to remove the atom or molecule from the grain surface, corresponding to 1000 K if the binding energy Eb is expressed as a temperature T = Eb/ k. The exact value depends on the composition and structure of the surface and on the type of gas species. A much tighter coupling of a gas atom colliding with the grain surface is possible through chemical binding or chemisorption. It involves a profound change in the electron structure of the binding partners. The interaction is therefore much stronger (from 0.5 to 5 e V) and the range of the chemical potential shorter than in the case of physical adsorption. As a precondition for chemisorption, the surface must contain chemically active sites and the gas species should not consist of saturated molecules, like H2 or H20 but atoms, particularly hydrogen. In principle, radicals like OH could also chemically bind to the grain surface but prior to the reaction an activation barrier must be surmounted. This is not possible on a cold grain so that the process is probably unimportant there. Chemically active sites will have disappeared once the grain surface is covered by physical adsorption by one monolayer of, for example, H2 or H20. Therefore, the mean binding energy of atoms and molecules in an ice mantle several A or more thick is less than 0.5 e V. Quite generally, we expect grains in cold and dense clouds to be covered by a sheet of physically adsorbed ice. The"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Grain surfaces 279 sheet may be envisaged to be made either of pure water ice or to be a composite of different ices, such as H20, C02, NH3 and others, mixed in a certain proportion. 9.1.3 The sticking probability We estimate the probability 17 that an impinging gas atom stays on the grain surface; obviously, 0 :s 17 :s I. For the gas atom to stick, it must transfer to the dust particle in the collision an energy /';.E s greater than its kinetic energy Ek far from the surface; otherwise it will rebound. One can approximately evaluate the process by studying the interaction of the gas atom (subscript g) with just one surface atom (subscript s). We imagine the surface atom to be attached to a spring of force constant K so that it oscillates at frequency W s = JK/m s • For the interactive potential U (r) between the two atoms we use (9.7), where r = x g - X s > 0 is their distance and D the binding energy. Such a simple mechanical system is governed by the equations of motion msx s = - KX s - F mgx g = F (9.8) (9.9) if the surface atom of mass m s has its equilibrium position at x = O. The force associated with the potential, F (r) = - U ' (r), is attractive and negative when r is large and repulsive and positive when r is small. The gas atom passes in the collision first through the attractive potential where its kinetic energy increases, then encounters the repulsive part, which is almost like a wall (see figure 9.1), and rebounces at the distance rmin where U(rmin) = Ek. One finds the energy /';.E s which is transferred to the surface atom during the impact by numerically integrating the equations of motion. An analytical solution under simplifying assumptions is illustrative. Let us neglect the attraction in the potential and approximate its repulsive part by a parabola [Wat75], [ D + Ek 2 U(r) = -D + 4b 2 (r - 2b) -D o :s r :s 2b r > 2b. The repulsive potential U is often also written as U(r) = -D + (Ek + D)e- r /b; the constant b is then called the slope parameter and is of order 0.4 A. In the quadratic equation, the force F with which the gas atom is rejected becomes [ Fa F(r) = ~a - 2b r O:s r :s 2b r > 2b D+Ek with Fa = --- b To fix the initial conditions, let the gas atom at time t = 0 pass the point r = 2b with a velocity r = -J2(D + Ek)/m g .

As under most interstellar conditions Ek « D, we learn from formula (9.13) that the sticking efficiency is largely determined by the binding energy D for physical adsorption and by the mass ratio of gas-to-surface atom; this ratio is generally smaller than one, m g / m s « 1. This simple theory can be refined in various ways: one can take into account the reaction of the crystal; use a more suitable interaction potential because a gas atom generally hits a spot somewhere between several surface atoms; consider oblique incidence and the possibility that the gas atom repeatedly recoils from the grain surface. Elaborate estimates suggest that under most astronomically important circumstances sticking of the atoms is likely. To use a sticking coefficient between 0.1 and 1 presents an educated guess. 9.1.4 Thermal hopping, evaporation and reactions with activation barrier The more or less evenly spaced atoms on the surface of a grain act as force centers and the surface potential has a semi-regular hilly structure. A physically adsorbed gas atom or molecule finds itself in a potential minimum. It cannot travel freely along the surface because to move, it has to overcome the surrounding potential barrier of height Ua. The value of Ua is a few times smaller than the binding energy Eb of the gas atom, typically Ua '\" 0.3Eb. The atom can jump over the barrier classically by means of thermal excitation; alternatively, it may quantum mechanically tunnel through the barrier (see [Tie87] for details). • The adsorbed atom vibrates and thereby swaps its kinetic and potential energy with a characteristic frequency va.

If the mean residence time in the upper level is va I, the time scale for thermal hopping is t '\" v-I eUo/ kT hop a (9.14) where T is the grain temperature. For va, one may use the frequency of lattice vibration of the grain, typically a few times 10 13 S-I . A more accurate expression in the case of a symmetric harmonic potential is va = J2nsEb/n2m where n s denotes the surface density of sites, m and Eb are the mass and binding energy of the adsorbed atom. If Ua < kT, thermal hopping is very quick and thop '\" vOl, otherwise thop increases exponentially. When an adsorbed atom moves on the surface of a grain by thermal hopping, it has no preferential direction when jumping from one site to the next and its path is a random walk (see figures 9.4 and 9.5).

However, an atom has the possibility to quantum mechanically tunnel through the potential barrier as discussed in section 6.4. When the potential barrier Ua is infinite, the levels are degenerate (the U here is denoted V in section 6.4). For finite Ua, there is energy splitting with an amount E2 - EI that increases as Ua is lowered (see (6.61)). According to (6.63), the tunneling time ttun'\" vOl exp (2; J 2mu a) is short for small Ua. The gas atom on the grain surface then has a high mobility and is not fixed to any particular site.

A real grain has defects on its surface, i.e. sites surrounded by a high potential which the atom cannot penetrate and where it is deflected in its motion, thus leading to a random walk.

The energy absorbed by a subvolume dV of a grain is given by (2.52). When one applies the Gauss theorem (A.l3), one gets dW a = - divSdV where S is the Poynting vector. Let the subvolume be at a depth x below the surface. The likelihood P that the absorption leads to emission of a photoelectron is assumed to have the form P = Cexp(-x/le). The factor C incorporates the following two probabilities: for excitation of an electron to a 'free' state and, when such an electron has reached the surface, for penetrating to the outside and not being reflected. The exponential term exp( - x/Ie) gives the probability that the electron reaches the surface at all and is not de-excited in any of the scattering processes on the way. The deeper the subvolume dV below the grain surface, the higher the chance for de- excitation. The mean free path of electrons in the bulk material, Ie, is of order 30 A, possibly shorter for metals and longer in dielectrics. Because of the factor e- x / Ie, it is evident that small grains (radii a '\" 50 A) are much more efficient in photoemission than big ones (a '\" 1000 A). From Mie theory, one can compute the internal field of the grain (the relevant formula is (2.45)) and thus the Poynting vector. The yield Yv for electron emission induced by photons of frequency v is now defined via the equation Yv [diVSdV=C [e-X/lediVSdV (9.26) where the integrals extend over the whole grain volume V. The material constants are uncertain but various evidence points towards Yv '\" 0.1 [Wat72]. 9.2.2.3 The photoelectric effect and gas heating Photoemission can also be important for heating the interstellar gas. As the mean kinetic energy of a photoejected electron, E v , exceeds the average thermal energy ~kT of a gas particle, the excess energy, after subtraction of the electrostatic grain potential U, is collisionally imparted to the gas. In the end, the electron is thermalized and its own average energy will then also be ~kT.

After N steps, one has arrived at the position RN = RN -I + LN. If the vectors Li are of constant length L but in an arbitrary direction, the mean square of the distance, (R~), grows like (9.28) It is straightforward to prove (9.28) by induction because the average of RN' LN-I obviously vanishes.

Suppose one applies a constant outer force F on the test particle of mass M. It then experiences a drag from the fluid or gas molecules that is proportional to its velocity x = V and the equation of motion of the test particle reads: F = Mx + fJ,x. (9.29) On the right stands an accelerational term M x and a dissipational term. The coefficient fJ, in the latter depends on the properties of both the fluid and the test particle. In a steady state, x = 0 and F = fJ, V. We determine the force F in (9.29) needed to move a spherical grain of geometrical cross section n a 2 at a constant velocity V through a gas.

Evaluating this formula for typical numbers of L*, Nand T, one finds that in stellar environments supersonic drift speeds are easily achieved. However, in many configurations grains are not directly exposed to starlight but irradiated by infrared photons to which the starlight has been converted through foreground matter. In such circumstances, Crp is much smaller than the geometrical cross section and V accordingly smaller, too. Around main sequence stars, the gas density is always low and the gas drag unimportant. A grain is attracted towards the star of mass M* by gravitation and repelled by radiation pressure. From the balance between the two, one obtains a critical grain radius independent of the distance: 3L* acr= ----- 47TC GPgrM* or (9.33) (9.34) (9.35) (9.36) acr (L* ) (M* )-1 -~024 - -- !Lm -.

It has a translatory and a rotational part but for the moment we neglect rotation.

If M and V denote the mass and velocity of the dust particle, 3k 1 2 2: T gas = Ekin = 2: MV . The Brownian velocity V follows from V = j3k;;as. Even a small grain of a = 100 A with bulk density Pgr = 2.5 g cm- 3 has in a 20 K gas only V = 28 cm S-I: it is practically at rest. The kinetic energy of the grain, Ekin, is, on average, equally distributed among the three degrees of freedom, so"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Grain motion 293 The one-dimensional equation (9.29) is also correct with respect to the Brownian motion of interstellar grains when the retardation is not due to an external force but to internal friction.

After a disorder or damping time tdis, it will have completely lost its memory about PO. One impinging gas atom of mass m « M and velocity v changes the momentum of the grain statistically by mv, and Z atoms by mv-J\"Z, as in a random walk. So in equipartition, when MV 2 = mv 2 the momentum of the grain is profoundly altered after M I m collisions, i.e. when the mass of the colliding atoms equals the mass of the grain. Therefore, in a gas of number density N, the disorder or damping time is M tdis = 2· Nmvna Because F = fJ, V = M dV I dt ::::: MV I tdis, the friction coefficient can be expressed through the damping time tdis, M fJ, = -. tdis (9.40)"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"294 Dust and its environmell! o Ui' 100 \"- E u ~ >~ >\" '\" .'!!

It is roughly the interval after which there is a change in the direction of the velocity vector of the grain by 90 0 or in its kinetic energy by more than 50%.

So the discussion does not apply to grains in the interstellar medium but is relevant to dust particles in accretion disks (section 1504) or planetary atmospheres. • A laminar flow of velocity v around a sphere of radius a exerts, according to Stokes law, a force F = 67TlJaV (9041) where lJ = pv, and p and v are the density and kinematic viscosity coefficient of the gas (see the empirical relation (15.74) and equation (15.89)). For the coefficient JL in (9.29) we find, by comparison with (9041), that JL = 67TlJa. The retarding force F in (9 AI) is linearly proportional to the velocity v but also to the radius a. This somewhat strange result can be understood from (15.74), if one writes for a sphere: av 2 F = vp-27Ta aa and replaces the derivative a v / aa by v / a. To obtain the coefficient 67T rigorously is tiresome. A sphere rotating at velocity v at the circumference is retarded by a torque T = Fa with F also approximately given by (9041). • When the flow is turbulent, the decelerating force becomes as in (9.32). F is now proportional to the cross section 7T a 2 , the gas density p = Nm and the velocity squared. The coefficient ew depends on the Reynolds number (15.93) and is of order one. But even in a turbulent flow there is a laminar surface layer of thickness D, in which the gas velocity increases from zero, on the surface of the body, to v at the boundary of the layer.

This has the advantage over an interstellar grain that its properties are known and that it is shaped like a perfect sphere, almost.

By equating the p dV work (here dV = infinitesimal volume) to the work required to create new surface, it also follows that the pressure p inside a drop of radius a is given by 2( p=-. a (9.45) The pressure can become high, it is more than ten times the atmospheric pressure at sea level for a rain drop 0.1 !Lm in radius.

In such a reference frame, the stellar photons approach the grain not exactly along the radius vector from the star but hit it slightly head-on in view of the aberration of light. This phenomenon arises because one has to add the velocity of the photon and the grain according to the rules of special relativity. The photons thus decrease the angular momentum of the grain and force it to spiral into the star. The Poynting-Robertson effect also works when the photons are not absorbed but isotropically scattered. 9.4 Grain destruction 9.4.1 Mass balance in the Milky Way Grains do not live forever but have a finite lifetime. As part of the dynamic, continually changing interstellar medium, they are born, modified and destroyed in processes such as Birth: Accretion: Coagulation: Destruction: mainly in old (evolved) stars with extended shells but possibly also in novae and supernovae (SN). in dark clouds, gas atoms condense onto grain surfaces to form mantles. in dark clouds, grains collide, stick and form larger particles. partial or complete, mainly in star formation, hot gas or shocks. In a steady state, dust formation is balanced by dust destruction. The rates at which this happens are quite uncertain. Therefore the numbers given here are not precise at all but they do show the order of magnitude. As gas and dust are intimately linked, we begin with a few remarks about the mass balance of all interstellar matter in the Milky Way; four important numbers are listed in table 9.1. The star formation rate implies that within one billion years, a short period compared to the Hubble time, all interstellar matter, including dust, is processed in stars. The continuous mass loss of gas in star formation must be offset by an equal mass input. It comes mainly from planetary nebulae which supply about 80% of the gas, red giants (\"'20%) and supernovae ('\" 10%?). Let us denote the input rates of dust due to planetary nebulae, red giants and supernovae by lPN, IRG and ISN, respectively, and express them in solar masses per year. Most grains probably form in the wind of red giants (like M stars, OHIIR and carbon stars) as high temperature condensates. The total gas input in the Milky Way from red giants is about I M 0 yC 1 and about I % of this is expected to be in the form of dust. So the input rate of dust from red giants is"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Grain destruction 299 Table 9.1. Global parameters of the Milky Way relevant to the mass balance of dust.

To estimate the contribution of supernovae to the dust balance, suppose that 3 M 0 of heavy elements are ejected per SN explosion. Although this is all potential dust material, a considerable fraction is locked up in CO, H20 or otherwise and is unable to form grains.

The solid is heated up to the condensation temperature. This happens near luminous stars, to a certain extent in HI! regions (section 14.4), also in the diffuse medium (section 14.3) when the grains are extremely small or have volatile mantles.

The threshhold impact energy for liberating an atom from the solid phase is a few times larger than the binding energy of an atom (\"'5 eV). But even for impact energies above the threshhold, atoms are chipped off only with an efficiency 17 smaller than one, possibly 17 '\" 0.1."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"300 Dust and its environment • Grain-grain collisions after acceleration in a magnetic field. • Shattering which is the destruction of a grain into smaller units, usually in grain-grain collisions. • Photodesorption which is the ejection of grain atoms by photons. 9.4.2.1 Destruction in shocks Besides star formation, grains are mostly destroyed in shocks associated with supernova remnants (SNR). The observational evidence comes from clouds of high velocity (v > 100 km S-I) where more than half of Si and Fe is in the gas phase, whereas in normal clouds only a fraction of order I % of these atoms is in the gas phase. High-velocity clouds are interpreted to be fragments of an expanding and shocked supernova shell. The mechanism of grain destruction depends on the type of shock: • In a fast shock, cooling is slow. The shock is adiabatic or non-radiative and has a moderate density jump of four. Sputtering is thermal because the velocities of the gas atoms are thermal. A shock with v '\" 300 km S-1 corresponds to a temperature T '\" 3 x 10 6 K. If one determines the rate of impinging protons using (9.1) and adopts a gas density n = I cm- 3 , one finds that at least small grains are likely to be eroded. • In a low-velocity shock, the cooling time is smaller than the expansion time of the supernova remnant. The shock is radiative and the density jump is much greater than four. A charged grain of mass m will gyrate in the magnetic field B. As BII, the component of B parallel to the shock front, is compressed, the grain velocity v gr increases because its magnetic moment JL = mvir/2BII is conserved and the grain is accelerated (betatron acceleration). The collisional velocities between the grain and the gas atoms are now non-thermal and non-thermal sputtering dominates. The final velocity v gr is limited by drag forces from the gas. The decelaration is proportional to the inverse of the grain radius, so big grains become faster than small ones and are more easily destroyed; small grains may survive. Grains may also collide with one another. A velocity of 100 km S-1 corresponds to '\" 1000 eV kinetic energy per atom, whereas the binding energy is only 5 ... 10 eV for refractory material; grains will be vaporized if the efficiency for knocking off atoms is greater than 1%. To estimate the importance of shock destruction, we turn to the theory of supernova blasts. During the first (Sedov) stage, the remnant of mass MSNR and velocity v is adiabatic and its kinetic energy E = !MSNRV 2 conserved; at later times, the momentum VMSNR is constant. According to [McK89], the shock becomes radiative when v :s 200(n 2 / E51) 1/14 km S-I; E51 is the energy expressed in units of 10 51 erg. In a gas of density n = I cm- 3 and with the standard explosion energy E51 = I, one finds for the mass of the supernova shell MSNR '\" 10 3 M 0 at the onset of the radiative phase.

In a steady state, this requires an additional dust source for which accretion in the interstellar medium, especially in dark clouds, is usually invoked. 9.4.2.2 Sputtering in the coronal gas Sputtering of refractory grains also occurs in the hot coronal gas (T = 10 6 K) where all atoms are very energetic ('\"'-' 100 eV).

Low-velocity shocks are also efficacious. Therefore the mantle material with a low binding energy is confined to dark clouds, in agreement with observations. 9.5 Grain formation We derive approximate equations that describe the nucleation of monomers into large clusters. The examples refer to water because its properties are experimentally well established but the physics apply, with some modifications, also to interstellar grains. There, however, the material constants are poorly known. 9.5.1 Evaporation temperature of dust When two phases, like liquid and gas, are in equilibrium at temperature T, the vapor pressure P changes with T according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, dP Q dT (V g - Vf)T (9.50)"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"302 Dust and its environment 1 G P r Vg,r 1 2 Figure 9.7.

The fundamental fOlIDula (9.50) is derived in a thought experiment from a Camot cycle: • First. one totally vaporizes at constant temperature T one mol of a liquid in a vessel closed by an adjustable weight (of the kind as depicted on the left- hand of figure 9.7); this requires heat Q. During the phase tram>ition from fluid to gas. the substance expands from Vr to V g and the vapor pressure P does the work P (Vg ~ Vr) by lifting a piston. • Then the vapor is condensed in another heat bath at slightly lower temperature T ~ dT and pressure P - d P. In this way. one retums the latent heat Q' and the work (P - d/~)(Vg - Vr). Finally, one brings the system back to its initial state (P, T).

(V g - Vf) = Q - Q'. The efficiency of converting heat Q into work is dP . (V g - Vf) dT 1J= =- Q T (9.52) (9.53) and, according to the second law of thermodynamics, no heat engine can do better. Because Vf « V g , we can approximate (9.50) by dlnP Q dT RT2 which has the solution P = Po e- To / T TO=Q/R. (9.54) The affinity to the Boltzmann distribution is not only formal but physical because atoms in the gas are in an energetically higher state than atoms in a solid. Equation (9.54) is very general and does not say anything about the details of a specific phase transition. Therefore, Po and To have to be determined experimentally. Laboratory data for water ice from O°C down to -98°C are displayed in figure 9.8. They can be neatly fit over the whole range by equation (9.54) with properly chosen constants. One gram of H20, in whatever form, has N = 3.22 x 10 22 molecules. If it is ice, it takes 79.4 cal to liquify it at O°C, then 100 cal to heat it up the water to 100°C and another 539.1 cal to vaporize the water. In cooling the vapor by /';.T = 100 K from 100 to O°C, assuming six degrees of freedom per molecule, one gains 3Nk/';.T = 1.37 x 10 9 erg. Because 1 cal = 4.184 x 10 7 erg the total sublimation energy per H20 molecule at O°C is, therefore, kT = 8.64 x 10- 13 erg corresponding to a temperature of 6260 K. This agrees nicely with the fit parameter To = 6170 K in figure 9.8. The evaporation temperature T evap in interstellar space of a species X frozen out on grain mantles follows by setting its partial pressure in the gas phase, nxkT, equal to the evaporation pressure, Poe-TO/Tevap = nxkTevap. (9.55) Because of the exponential dependence of the vapor pressure on temperature, the result is rather insensitive to the gas density. At hydrogen densities of order \"'10 6 cm- 3 , water ice evaporates at T '\" 120 K as one can read from figure 9.8 assuming an H20 abundance of 10- 7 . Ammonia and methane go into the gas phase already at about 90 and 70 K, respectively. A rise in density from 10 6 to 10 12 cm- 3 increases the evaporation pressure for H20, NH3 and CH4 by \"'30 K.

As molecules leave the grain, the surface area shrinks by an amount dA thereby creating the energydW = ~dA according to (9.43). Evaporation is. therefore. easier in grains of small radius r and their vapor pressure Pr is higher than that over a flat surface. Poc. This has fundamental consequences. To compute Pro one perfonns an isothennal reversible cycle of four steps. Here. we write down the work Wi that is being done in each step; the fonnulae for Wi are elementary. (I) In vessel I is asmallliquidsphereofradiusr at temperature Tin equiliblium with its vapor of pressure pr (figure 9.7). The volumes per mol of gas and"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Grain formation 305 fluid are Vg,r and Vf, respectively. We evaporate the droplet but in such a way that while evaporating we inject with a syringe into the sphere against the internal pressure P = 2l; I r of (9.45) and the outer pressure Pr the same amount of liquid as is being lost to the gas, so all the time r = constant. When I mol has become gaseous, (2) Isothermal expansion from pressure Pr to Poo of the I mol of gas that has been vaporized in step (l), (3) The I mol of vapor is pressed into vessel 2 where the liquid has a plane surface and is under its vapor pressure Poo, W3 = -RT. (4) To complete the cycle, we take from vessel 2 with a syringe I mol of liquid, As the cycle was isothermal (dT = 0), the sum L Wi must be zero. Let va denote the volume of one molecule in the liquid phase. Because RT = P V and because the pressure in the drop, 2l; Ir, is much bigger than Pr - Poo, we obtain Pr 2l;va In- = --. Poo kTr (9.56) This tells us that the vapor pressure Pr = Poo ·e2~vo/ kTr equals Poo for big spheres but increases exponentially when the radius becomes very small. Condensation of the first seed grains is thus possible only when the partial pressure P exceeds Poo or when the saturation parameter s (capital S for the entropy) defined by P s=- Poo (9.57) is greater than one. The vapor is then said to be supersaturated. At pressure Pr given by (9.56), a sphere of diameter 2r is in equilibrium with the vapor, a bigger drop will grow indefinitely, a smaller one will evaporate, so r is the critical cluster radius. 9.5.3 Critical saturation To estimate the critical saturation parameter Ser > I at which clusters are created, we calculate the work W needed to form in a reversible cycle a drop of radius"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"306 Dust and its environment r. The drop consists of n atoms and is formed in a vessel with vapor at pressure p and temperature T. The work in each of the four steps is denoted by Wi, so W=I:Wi. (l) Remove n gas atoms from the vessel, WI = -nkT. (2) Isothermally expand these n atoms from p to Poo, (3) Press the n atoms into another vessel, also at temperature T but containing a liquid of flat surface under vapor pressure Poo, W3 = nkT. (4) Form there from the liquid a drop ofradius r (and bring it back to the first vessel), 2 W4 = 47T(r . For the sum we get W = -nkTln(p/ Poo) + 47T(r 2 = ~( . 47Tr 2 . (9.58) (9.59) The term -nkT In(p / Poo) is the potential energy of the drop. It is proportional to the number of molecules n because the molecules possess short- range forces and, therefore, only connect to their nearest neighbors. For long- range forces, the term would be proportional to n 2 . The other term 47T(r 2 , which goes as n 2 / 3 , introduces a correction because atoms on the surface are attracted only from one side. As the energy of the system stays constant over the cycle, one has, according to the first law of thermodynamics, to subtract from the system the heat Q = W. Therefore, during formation of the droplet the entropy of the system falls by (see (5.51)) S = Q/T = 47T(r 2 /3T. S decreases because a liquid represents a state of higher order than a gas. Although the entropy of a macroscopic system can only increase, on a microscopic level all processes are reversible and S fluctuates. Formation of a seed grain comes about by such an entropy fluctuation. As the entropy is after (5.43) equal to Boltzmann constant k multiplied by the logarithm of the number Q of states, S = kIn Q, the probability P = 1/ Q for the formation of a seed is given by e- s / k. When we insert the saturation parameter s = p / Poo of (9.57), simple algebra yields P = ~ = e- S / k = exp (_ 47T(r 2 ) = exp (_ 167T(3 Vg ).

The probability P is most sensitive to I; / T and, if I; / T is fixed, to s, changing from practically impossible to highly likely in a narrow interval ~s. It is exactly this property which allows us to estimate the critical value Ser as follows. If N, v and a denote the number density, mean velocity and collisional cross section of the vapor atoms, there are, per second, N 2 va atomic collisions each leading with a probability P to the formation of a seed. So J = N 2 va P is the rate at which seeds form and the condition yields Ser. The outcome of the simple calculation depends entirely on the exponent in (9.59) which has to be of order one; the factor N 2 va has very little influence. One finds typical values of the critical saturation parameter for water at room temperature around 10 which implies in view of (9.56) a critical seed radius r er of a few angstroms. 9.5.4 Equations for time-dependent homogeneous nucleation Let us study the creation of seed grains in a kinetic picture. If the gas has only one kind of atoms or molecules of mass m, one speaks of homogeneous nucleation, in contrast to heterogeneous nucleation when different molecular species or ions are present. A small cluster or droplet of n molecules is an n-mer with concentration Cn. The number density of the gas molecules (they are monomers) is, therefore, denoted Cl. A cluster has a radius r n and a surface area An = 4nr;. When va is the volume of one molecule, nand r n are related through 4n 3 nva = 3 rn · Consider a gas of constant temperature T and pressure P = clkT with saturation parameter S = P / Poo > 1 after (9.57). If atoms impinge on a drop at a rate f3n An and evaporate from it at a rate an An, the concentration C n changes with time like (9.60) This is a very general equation, all the physics is contained in the coefficients for evaporation and accretion, an and f3n. If we assume that atoms are added to the grain at a rate nr;(v)cl and leave at a rate nr;(v)Pn/kT, where (v) is the mean velocity of (9.1) and Pn / kT from (9.56), then Pn an = -.;r='2=n=m===k=T f3= P ';2nmkT (9.61)"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"308 Dust and its environment In this case, f3 is constant for all n and the sticking coefficient is one; Pn is the vapor pressure of an n-mer according to (9.56).

The function flG n is depicted in figure 9.9; it has its maximum at n* where a flGn/an = O. All values at n* will, in the following, be marked by an asterisk. Clusters of size smaller than n* are inside a potential well and fight an up-hill battle when growing. They have to overcome the barrier of height flG*. When they have climbed the barrier, their size is n* and for n > n*, they will grow unrestrictedly. So n* is the critical size. Figure 9.10 plots the dependence of n* on the saturation parameter s.

Such a situation prevails in the outward flowing wind of mass loss giants where most interstellar grains are formed. When the partial gas pressure of the condensible component, P = clkT, reaches the vapor pressure P 00 over a flat surface, the saturation parameter s equals one. At this instant, the gas temperature is denoted by T e and the time t is set to zero. As the gas cools further, s increases. At first, the steady-state nucleation rate J' is negligible because all clusters are below the critical size n* (see figure 9.9) and the time it takes to form one critical cluster, roughly given by the inverse of J', is unrealistically long. Only when the saturation parameter approaches the critical value Scr at time t cr do clusters become bigger than the critical size n* and catastrophic nucleation sets in.

The second, A, is determined by the conditions in the environment, such as gas density Cl and cooling rate t but it also reflects the physics of the dust via the constant To in the expression for the evaporation temperature of the grain material (see (9.54)). The final grain size is largely influenced by A (see definition of p). 9.5.7.1 Cautioning remarks The quantitative results of homogeneous nucleation theory outlined here are fairly speculative because of the intrinsically exponential behavior of the process of grain formation and a number of dubious assumptions, oversimplifications and"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"318 Dust and its environment unsolved problems, such as (recommended reading [Fed66, Abr74]) the following ones. • The smallest clusters are not spheres. • The latent heat of the condensing molecules should not be neglected. • The surface tension of the smallest clusters is unknown, the concept being even ill defined. Replacing l; by l;r = l; / [1 + 8/ r ], where 8 is a curvature correction of atomic length ('\" lA) and r the grain radius, does not solve the problem. • The thermodynamics of small clusters, in particular, the proper expression for the free enthalpy, is still controversial. A drop also has macroscopic motion but it is not clear how its translation and rotation replaces the internal degrees of freedom. Because of this uncertainty, immense fudge factors (up to 10 17 for the concentration of the critical clusters) are cited in the literature. We mention that because of the macroscopic motion, which was neglected in our derivation of (9.57), the correct formula for the vapor pressure of a drop is not (9.57) but In(Pr/ Poo) = 2l;vo/ kTr - 4/n, where n is the number of molecules in the cluster [Kuh52]. Besides such intrinsic uncertainties in the theory of homegenous nucleation, astronomical real life is even more complicated. First, nucleation in the wind of giants is not homogeneous but proceeds in a vast network of chemical reactions involving many different species for which we do not know the rate coefficients. Second, stellar photons are present in the wind that create new reaction channels and the radiation field is not in equilibrium with the gas. So when it comes to the question of how much one learns by applying homogeneous nucleation theory to grain formation in the outflow of red giants, an honest answer is sobering. Another reason for this dissatisfactory state of affairs is the limited possibility to compare observations with theory. Observations consist of infrared spectra that do not carry detailed information about the dust. All they tell us is that silicates do form in M-type stars, as can be inferred from the presence of the 10 !Lm band, and where we expect carbon dust, it is there and not graphitic because of the absence of the 2200 A feature. However, there is no information in the spectra about grain size or the dependence of growth on the physical parameters of the medium."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 Polarization Electromagnetic radiation can become polarized by interstellar dust in three ways: • Through scattering, which we have already discussed and illustrated. The achieved degree of polarization can be very high. • Through extinction. When starlight passes through a dust cloud, the weakening of the flux depends on the orientation of the electric vector. Many reddened stars appear to be polarized, up to 10% or so, although the emission from the stellar photosphere is certainly not. • Through emission. The far infrared radiation of some clouds shows a small degree of polarization. To explain the latter two phenomena, one has to evoke the presence of non- spherical grains, for example elongated particles shaped like cigars. They must also be aligned, otherwise the net polarization would be zero. 10.1 Efficiency of infinite cylinders As an approximation to elongated particles, we can treat dust grains as infinite circular cylinders. Although interstellar grains are certainly neither exactly cylindric nor infinitely long (at best they are elongated), such an idealization provides quantitative estimates for the real particles. The problem of computing the electromagnetic field in the interaction of light with an infinite cylinder for any ratio of cylinder radius over wavelength was first solved by Rayleigh [RayI8] for normal incidence and by Wait [Wai55] for oblique incidence. It is also possible to handle coated or multi-layered cylinders. We skip the mathematical derivation of the cross sections, the numerical code is still fairly simple. 10.1.1 Normal incidence and picket fence alignment Consider a very long circular cylinder of length L much longer than its radius, a, or the wavelength A. We call the cylinder infinite when on halving its length 319"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"320 Polarization L, the cross section C is also halved; C / L is then constant. When light impinges under normal incidence, the cylinder axis is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. In this case, there are two extinction cross sections depending on the polarization of the incident light: • c~xt: the cylinder axis is parallel to the electric and perpendicular to the magnetic vector of the incident electromagnetic field. • crt: the cylinder axis is perpendicular to the electric and parallel to the magnetic vector of the incident electromagnetic field. They are not equal and, therefore, unpolarized light becomes slightly linearly polarized after interaction with the cylinder. What counts is the difference \"c ext _ C ext _ C ext L..l - II 1... When there are many such cylinders with their axes all parallel, one speaks of picket fence alignment. The efficiency Q is defined as the cross section over projected area, c Q = 2aL· (l0.1) In this section, we mostly talk about extinction efficiencies and sometimes omit the superscript 'ext'. In figure 10.1 we present Q~xt and Q~t for infinite cylinders with circular cross section. We adopt m = 1.7 + iO.03, which is about the optical constant of silicate material between 0.3 and 2 /Lm, i.e. over the whole visible region and part of the near IR. Carbon, the other major chemical component of interstellar dust, is often disregarded in the context of polarization because, without any magnetic inclusions, it is hard to align. However, we will also consider in this chapter examples of carbon particles. By comparing the top of figure 10.1 with figure 4.2, we see that the extinction efficiency of a cylinder mimics, in every aspect that of a sphere, except that we now have two Qs differing by an amount ~Qext = Q~xt - Q~t. Note that ~Qext may be negative. The efficiencies Q~xt and Q~t reach their first maximum at size parameter x ::::: 2.5, whereas the difference ~ Qext has a flat peak near x ::::: I. In the bottom frame of figure 10.1, the display of ~ Qext is rearranged. It refers to the same optical constant m = 1.7 + iO.03 but we now keep the wavelength A fixed and vary the radius. We choose A = 0.55 /Lm, which is the center of the visual band V, because there the observed interstellar polarization typically attains its maximum. The figure informs us that in polarizing visible light, silicate grains of cylindrical shape are most efficient when their radii are about 0.1 /Lm and that much thinner or thicker cylinders are ineffective. Because for a given dielectric permeability, ~ Qext is only a function of the size parameter x = 277: a / A, we further learn that there is a direct proportionality between the cylinder radius and the wavelength A max of maximum polarization.

Normal incidence corresponds to e = 90°, whereas at e = 0, k is parallel to the cylinder axis. It is also, in the case of oblique incidence, customary to call the quantity Q = C /2aL the efficiency, although this is not in accord with the definition for Q in (2.9), where C is divided by the projected geometrical cross section 2aL sin e. Anyway, with Q = C /2aL, Q(e) --+ 0 for e --+ O. Furthermore, when the cylinder has a very large radius, the efficiency reflects the geometrical contraction, so Q(e) ex: sine for a» A. Formulae to compute Q for normal incidence are found, for instance, in [Boh83], for oblique incidence in [Lin66]. Figure 10.2 shows the efficiences QII and Q1.. as a function of orientation angle e for size parameters x = 277: a / A in the range where polarization has its maximum. Around normal incidence down to orientation angles of 40°, the efficiencies Q II and Q 1.. as well as their difference II Q are rather constant. When the cylinder is tilted further, QII and Q1.. converge and for extremely oblique incidence they tend to zero. There is a sharp resonance for the curve with the size parameter x = 0.6 that peaks at an orientation angle of 0.55°. The sinusoidal dependence of Q on e for large size parameters is already indicated in the curve with x = 2. 10.1.3 Rotating cylinders Grains in interstellar space are knocked about by gas atoms and rotate. Therefore we also have to evaluate the cross section of a spinning cylinder. The incidence is generally oblique but we have just learnt how to handle this. During rotation the incident angle e varies, so one has to form an average over a rotation cycle. Suppose the cylinder circles in the (x, y)-plane of a Cartesian coordinate system, presented by the page of this book, and its momentary location is characterized by the angle ¢ (see figure 10.3). Let the cylinder be illuminated by an unpolarized flux whose wavevector k lies in the (y, z)-plane and makes an angle 90 - \\If with the z-axis. At \\If = 90°, light falls directly from above on the page and then, for reasons of symmetry, there will be, on average, no polarization. At an angle \\If = 0°, the wavevector lies in the (x, y)-plane; then cross sections are different for electric vectors along the x- and z-axes. While the cylinder spins, the angle e between k, the direction of wave propagation, and the cylinder axis changes. We can figure out in a quiet moment that e is given by cos e = cos \\If cos ¢.

Linear polarization of the star HD 161056 [Som94]. Dots represent measurements, the full curve is the best fit Serkowski curve. Reproduced from [Som94] with permission of the American Astronomical Society. 10.2.2 The Serkowski curve A central question is how the polarization, p(A), varies with wavelength as stellar light is extinguished by aligned grains in foreground clouds. Figure 10.8 presents, as an example, multi-wavelength observations of the star HD 161056 in the spectral interval from 0.13 to 3.6 /Lm. The data are nicely fitted by the expression p(A) [ 2 ( A )] -- = exp -kIn -- . Pm~ Am~ (10.8) This functional form of p(A) is called the Serkowski curve after one of the pioneers in the field. As the logarithm in (10.8) is squared, it does not matter whether we write A/Am~ or Am~/A in the exponent. The Serkowski curve approximates polarization measurements of most stars quite well. It has three parameters: Am~, Pm~ and k. The meaning of Am~ is obvious-it is the wavelength where the degree of polarization reaches its maximum Pm~. It is also easy to see that the parameter k determines the width of the curve. Equation (10.8) is just a mathematical construct to fit empirical data, nothing more and certainly not a law. Nature also takes the liberty of behaving otherwise. In section 10.1, we calculated, from Mie theory, the cross sections of infinite cylinders. We now apply these results in an attempt to give a theoretical"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"330 Polarization explanation to the Serkowski curve. For this purpose, we go back to figure 10.4 which displays the difference ~Qext = QII - Ql.. in the extinction efficiency of rotating cylinders as a function of size parameter x = 2na/A, and also for various inclination angles \\If of the rotation axis. We infer from equation (l0.7) that ~Qext(A) is generally proportional to the polarization p(A) and thus has the same wavelength dependence. The refractive index of the cylinder material in figure 10.4 is m = 1.7 + iO.03, representative of silicate at optical and near IR wavelengths. When we use exactly the data of figure 10.4 but rearrange them by fixing the cylinder radius to some typical size, say a = 0.1 /Lm, so that only A appears in the abscissa, the plots already look quite similar to a Serkowski curve. Figure 10.9 shows two alignment scenarios. On the left, the cylinders form a picket fence, on the right, they rotate with the rotation axis inclined by an angle \\If = 45°. In either configuration, the Serkowski curve gives a remarkably good fit. This quick result is gratifying and guides us in understanding why interstellar polarization has the functional form of equation (l0.8). It also testifies that such artificial geometrical bodies, like infinite cylinders, are, in their polarizing capabilities over a wide wavelength interval, from a tenth to a few micrometres, akin to real interstellar grains. Of course, the agreement in figure 10.9 between model and Serkowski curve is not perfect, locally it is far from it. There are broad and deep wiggles. Their maxima are spaced by ~x ::::: 0.7 but as the difference in the extinction efficiency, ~ Qext, depends only on x = 2n a/A, we know that a spread in cylinder radii by only 50% will effectively smear out the wiggles. Therefore, for a size distribution of cylinders, p(A) will be smooth and close to the Serkowski curve everywhere. Indeed, to achieve good agreement it takes only a few cylinder radii with proper size steps. For modeling polarization, the size distribution is not nearly as important as it is for modeling the extinction curve. We also conclude from figure 10.9 that rotation, as opposed to the picket fence, does not change the shape of the wavelength dependence of polarization greatly. Rotation mainly reduces the height of the curve (degree of polarization), whereas the parameters A max and k are not much affected. When one observes the wavelength dependence of polarization towards a large and diverse sample of stars, and then fits the measurements for each star by a Serkowski curve, one gets a continuous range of values for the three parameters (Pmax, k, A max ). Naturally, we expect strong fluctuations in Pmax. Their origin is trivial as this quantity must depend on the degree of grain alignment and is at small optical depth proportional to the number of particles, N g , in the line of sight. The variations in the other two parameters, k and A max , are more subtle. We do not expect them to be related to N g and the influence of alignment is uncertain and probably slight. If interstellar grains were the same everywhere, which is not a bad assumption for many purposes, we would be at a loss to explain the observed variations in k and A max . As variations are common, we conclude that"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Linear polarizarion through eMincrion 331 f:,Q 1 0.5 o ......... t>Q 0.3 0.2 0.1 o rotation '\" = 45° ............ o 1 2 wavelength o 1 2 wavelength 3 [}J.m] Figure 10.9.

Let us firsl look at the polarization curve of silicate cylinders with radius a = 0.1 11m. This is the fuJi curve in figure 10.10. It has three bumps (at about 0.6. 12 and 23 11m).

In least-square fits to peA} by a Serkowski curve, the parameters k and A max are. in both cases. almost identical (dots in figures 10.9 and 10.10). When one smooths the oscillations in the curves of figure 10.10 and detennines the location of the first peak (the one at A < 2'1m), one finds that the relation between Ama' and the cylinder radius a is roughly linear. Consequently, if the polarizing dust patticJes in interstellar space are silicate cylinders. they must have diameters of -0.2 11m. or a bit less. to yield the Serkowski curve with the standard Amax = 0.55 Mm.

For example, in the plot of p(A) for a = 0.025 /Lm, we can fit only the peak of the Serkowski curve. Likewise grains with a = 0.1 /Lm, which does not seem to be an unreasonable size, can be excluded not only because A max is far off in the near infrared but also because p(A) overshoots on the red side and is much too broad (k = 0.8). On these grounds, amorphous carbon is not likely to be the prime polarizing agent. 10.2.33 The ratio C 11/ C 1.. at optical and infrared wavelengths In the optical region, polarization is well described by the Serkowski curve which can be quantitatively reproduced by applying Mie theory to infinite cylinders. Maximum polarization occurs when the cylinder radius is comparable to the wavelength. The cylinder cross section CII is about 25% greater than C1.. (see figure 10.1). So the ratio CII / C 1.. is not far from unity and the cross sections are not very sensitive to the direction of the electric vector. In the infrared region, however, where the particles are small compared to wavelength, the ratio CII / C 1.. can be large. For instance, silicate cylinders at 10 /Lm (optical constant m = 1.36 + iO.95) have CII/C1.. = 2.61. At A = 1.3mm, where m = 3.41 +iO.034, this value goes up to 39.9 and for amorphous carbon cylinders the ratio approaches 10 4 (see figure 10.5). These numbers are independent of cylinder radius as long as a « A. 10.2.4 Polarization p('A) of ellipsoids in the Rayleigh limit Although infinite cylinders can reproduce the basic features of optical polarization, it is unsatisfactory that their shape is so artificial. We can improve the infinite cylinder model by treating ellipsoids as a more realistic alternative. They allow an investigation of a much greater variety of shapes. Cigars, a subclass with major axes a > b = c, include cylinders in the limit of infinite axial ratio a / c. In the infrared, the computation of cross sections is easy because the interstellar particles are then small compared to wavelength and we may apply the electrostatic approximation of section 3.3. It is also straightforward to compute coated ellipsoids, although we will not do so. They further widen the parameter space: one can then vary the axial ratio of the ellipsoids, their mantle thickness and the optical constants of core and mantle. Coated ellipsoids will thus be superior in fitting observations. However, a fit to observations becomes astronomically relevant not by its mere agreement with the data but by its ability to predict and to constrain our conception about dust. One must, therefore, critically ask whether a refinement of the dust model in the direction of complicating shape and composition deepens or muddles our understanding of dust.

Towards a uniform cloud of optical depth Tv, temperature Td and intensity Iv = Bv(Td) . [1 - e- rV ] the degree of polarized emission, p(A), becomes p = 2 - (e- rmin + e- rmin ) • We abide by the nomenclature of section 10.2 where T max and Tmin denote the optical depth at the position angle of maximum and minimum attenuation. In most cases and certainly at submillimeter wavelengths, the optical depth is small. The (positive) degree of polarization can then be written as T max - Tmin p:::::---- T max + Tmin (10.12) p depends on wavelength but not on T. Even for arbitrarily small T, the polarization is finite. As the optical depth increases, the polarization can only decrease. This is quite contrary to polarization by extinction which grows with T and vanishes for T --+ O. We start the discussion of polarized dust emission according to equation (10.12) with cylinders. Their cross sections for light when the electric vector lies along or perpendicular to the cylinder axis, CII and C1.., can differ by orders of magnitude, as is evident from figure 10.5. Even for a dielectric, the ratio CII / C 1.. may be above 10. We, therefore, expect a very high degree of polarization in the case of complete alignment (see figure 10.16). Rotation of the cylinders roughly halves the value of CII / C 1.. with respect to picket fence alignment but CII / C 1.. is still large, so p(A) does not change much. It also turns out that when the rotation vector is inclined towards the observer, the degree of polarization drops less swiftly than in the case of extinction (see figure lOA). 10.3.2 Infrared emission of spheroids At low frequencies, one can also easily compute spheroids in the small particle limit as outlined in section 3.3. Let the grains have major axes a ::: b ::: c with corresponding cross sections C a , Cb, C e .

It is easy to see that the polarization vectors associated with these two processes, emission and extinction, are perpendicular to each other. A polarization vector is defined by its length. which is equal to the degree of polarization. and by the direction where the electric field vector has ils maximum: the associated angles have values between 0° and 180°.

Because the influence of grain elongation on fJ is markedly different at visual and far infrared wavelengths, this ratio contains, in principle, information on the particle shape. 10.4 Circular polarization In some media, the propagation of a linearly polarized wave is sensitive to the orientation of polarization because the building blocks of matter are anisotropic as, for example, in all crystals of the non-cubic lattice or substances consisting of long and aligned fibrous molecules. The optical constant, m = n + ik, depends then on orientation, too. This produces a number of interesting phenomena which can all be understood if the molecules are treated as harmonic oscillators. The particular structure of the molecules in the medium has the effect that the motions of the charges, which determine m or s after (1.77), depend on the direction of the electric field vector. • When the real part of the refractive index, n, is anisotropic, one speaks of birefringence. Calcite, CaC03, is the best known example. It splits an incident unpolarized beam into two polarized waves with different refraction angles (this is actually a special kind of birefringence known as anomalous refraction) . • When the imaginary part of the refractive index, k, differs in two directions, the phenomenon bears the name dichroism. The gem tourmaline is renowned for this property. We will be dealing with birefringence only. Imagine a slab filled with a medium that has unequal indices nil and nl.. in two perpendicular directions and thus unequal phase velocities. Let us shine linearly polarized light through the slab. The light is oriented in such a way that it can be decomposed into two equally strong waves, Ell and El.., linearly polarized along the principal directions. At the front of the slab, Ell and El.. are in phase, inside they will fallout of phase. When the phase difference amounts to n 12, the initially linearly polarized wave presented by the sum Ell + El.. has been converted into a circularly polarized wave; a slab with the right thickness to do just that is called a A-quarter plate. Quite generally, when light that is linearly polarized (but not along a principal direction) enters a birefringent medium, it leaves with some degree of circular polarization."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"(10.14) Circular polarization 343 There is another related phenomenon, optical activity, which we mention for completeness. Here the phase velocity of the medium is different for circularly polarized waves with opposite senses of rotation. A linearly polarized wave entering an optically active medium exits it still linearly polarized but with its orientation shifted by some angle. The electric vector is rotated to the right when the left-circular wave is faster and to the left otherwise. 10.4.1 The phase shift induced by grains When a dust cloud is traversed by a plane wave, the grains not only reduce the intensity of radiation but may also change the phase of the wave. To understand this, we exploit the complex scattering function S (e, ¢) discussed in section 2.2. Its value in the forward direction, S(O), canformally be interpreted as the optical constant of the interstellar medium, m = n + ik. The imaginary part, Im{S(O)}, determines, according to (2.22), the index of refraction, n -I, which is responsible for the phase velocity. A wave of wavenumber k = 277:/ A that passes through a plate of unit thickness and refractive index m = n + i k is phase-shifted with respect to a wave traversing a vacuum by ~¢ = k· (n - I). Let us define the volume coefficient for phase lag, Kpha, by putting Kpha = ~¢. If there are N particles per cm 3 , each with a cross section for phase lag C pha , so that Kpha = NC pha , we get, from (2.22), A 2 C pha = - Im{S(O)}. 277: When the wave has crossed a distance I, the components Ell and El.. of the electric vector E are out of phase by an angle The optical thickness over this distance I equals NIC ext . Therefore, an optical depth T produces a phase lag ~cpha ~¢=T--. C ext Near the wavelength A max of maximum linear polarization in the Serkowski curve, the ratio ~ Qpha / Qext = ~cpha / C ext (see (10.1)) is for silicate cylinders, very roughly, one tenth. Consequently, the phase lag in a cloud of visual optical depth T due to perfectly aligned cylinders is of order ~¢ ~ T /10.

As they are not sitting still but receive stochastically angular momentum in collisions with gas atoms, they spin and it is their rotation axes that have to be aligned somehow, not the grains themselves. Take, for example, a long cylinder spinning about an axis perpendicular to its symmetry axis. If the rotation vector points towards the observer, there will obviously be no preferential direction and the time-averaged polarization vanishes. However, if the rotation axis is at a right angle to the line of sight, one gets maximum polarization. The question of how alignment works has not been settled satisfactorily. One usually assumes the Davis-Greenstein mechanism which involves cumbersome details and is rather speculative. Although the impact of alignment studies on the rest of astronomy is humble, it is a delightful topic because of its physical richness. We summarize in the first two sections the tools necessary for understanding the mechanical and magnetic processes. Afterwards we describe them emphasizing the ideas behind them and not the final numbers which are rather vague. 11.1 Grain rotation 11.1.1 Euler's equations for a rotating body Rotating bodies seem to misbehave in the sense that their motion evades intuition: we push a spinning top one way and it goes the other. However, a child can ride a bicycle with ease, so somehow we can cope with rotation, at least in praxi. A freely rotating body, like an interstellar grain, rotates about its center of mass. The moment of inertia, I, depends on the axis about which it rotates. One can always find a rectangular coordinate system, fixed to the body, in which I is greatest about the z-axis and smallest about the x-axis. The moments along these principal axes are labeled Ix, I y , I z . If we plot, from the coordinate center, 347"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"348 Grain alignment the moment of inertia in any possible direction as an arrow whose length is given by the value of I, the tips of the arrows form the inertia ellipsoid. This is a very regular figure, no matter how irregular the body. For example, the inertia ellipsoid of a cube or a regular tetrahedron must, for reasons of symmetry, be a sphere. When we resolve the angular velocity with respect to the instantaneous values along the principal axes, the total angular momentum L, its square and the kinetic energy of the body are: L = (IxuJx, Iyw y , Izw z ) 2222222 L = Ix W x + I y w y + I z W z E rot = !(Ixw; + Iyw; + Izw;). (ll.l) (11.2) The equation of motion of a rotating body describes how its angular momentum L changes when a torque T is applied: dL T=-. dt (11.3) It corresponds to the equation for translatory motion, F = p, if we replace T by the force F and L by the momentum p. Likewise, the time variation in kinetic energy E of a freely spinning top is given by dE -=T·W. dt (11.4) This equation is analogous to E = F . v for translational motion, where v is the velocity. The product T . W also gives the power needed to sustain rotation at constant angular velocity W against a torque T due to friction. Without a torque, the angular momentum L stays constant in space and the tip of the vector L marks there a certain fixed point, let us call it Q. With respect to a coordinate system connected to the rotating body, Q is not constant but moving and the vector L as seen from the rotating body varies like ( dL) - =Lxw. dt body If there is a torque, L changes in space according to (11.3). As viewed from the rotating body, L, therefore, changes like ( dL) - =LXW+T dt body (11.5)"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Grain rotation 349 or in components T x = Ixw x - wyw z (Iy - I z ) T y = Iyw y - wzw x (Iz - Ix) T z = Izw z - wxwy(Ix - I y ). Formulae (11.5) or (11.6) are known as Euler's equations. 11.1.2 Symmetric tops (11.6) The kinematics of free rotation, which means without a torque, are not trivial, quite unlike the translation analog, where F = 0 implies boring uniform linear motion. For our purposes, it suffices to consider symmetric tops, i.e. bodies where the moments of inertia about two principal axes are equal, say Ix = I y . The body is then symmetric about the z-axis, which is called the figure axis. The solution of (11.6) is easy for T = 0 and Ix = I y . Obviously, W z is then zero. Taking the time derivative of the first equation of (11.6) to eliminate w y gives W x ex: W x and likewise for the y-component w y ex: w y , altogether W x = A sin Qt where A is a constant and W y = A cos Qt (11.7) (11.8) Ix - I z Q = w z --- Ix During the rotation, wand the figure axis describe circular cones around L. The length of the angular velocity vector w and its component W z are constant but w changes its direction in space as well as in the grain. It precesses around the figure axis with angular velocity Q. This implies time-variable stresses and, consequently, dissipation. In the general torque-free case, where all momenta Ix, I y , I z are unequal, equation (11.3) can still be solved with pencil and paper but the rotation axis and the principal axes perform complicated wobbling motions around L. • Formula (11.8) applies to the wandering of the pole of the Earth. For our planet,2n/w z = I day and IzI(Iz - Ix) = 305. The moment of inertia I z around the polar axis is greater than Ix around an axis that lies in the equatorial plane because the Earth has a bulge at the equator. From (11.8) one finds Q ::::: I yr, in qualitative agreement with the Chandler period. • The axis of the Earth is inclined against the normal vector of the ecliptic by 1/J = 23.5°. Its rotation is not really free because the Sun and the moon exert a torque T on the equatorial bulge of the Earth which causes the polar axis to slowly precess. To estimate the effect, we use equation (11.3) as we want to derive the change of the rotation axis with respect to the stars.

In the plane defined by the figure axis and the momentary rotation axis, the angular velocity vector w can be decomposed into (vz, which is constant, and into a perpendicular component (VI with moment of inertia I I = Ix. The angular velocity w, the figure axis and the angular momentum vector L all lie in one plane; the latter two form an angle e. L = Izw z is the angular momentum of the Earth.

If one applies the classical formula (1.13) (in which the vector J is the current density) to an electron in circular motion of angular momentum L, one gets e m=g--L 2mec with the Lande factor g = 1. This result is also true in quantum mechanics with respect to the orbital momentum L of the electron. However, in the case of pure spin momentum (8), g = 2. So the magnetic moment m associated with the spin of an electron (S = ! fO equals Bohr's magneton: {tB = ~ = 9.27 X 10- 21 [cgs]. 2mec (11.10) Quantum electrodynamics gives an upward correction; to first order in the fine structure constant a, it amounts to 0.116% ::::: a/2n. When 8 and L couple to form the total angular momentum J = 8 + L, the latter is usually not parallel to the net magnetic moment m because of the different Lande factors for 8 and L. We will mainly be concerned with pure spin angular momentum where J = 8. The field B exerts on the dipole m a torque T =m x B. (11.11) Because T stands perpendicular to the angular momentum J, the torque changes only its direction, not its length J. Therefore J precesses around B with angular frequency mB Wpr= -. J 11.1.4 Rotational Brownian motion (11.12) The results of section 9.3 on translatory Brownian motion may, in a straightforward way, be carried over to rotation. When there is equipartition between dust particles and gas, the grains perform translatory and rotational Brownian motion. The average kinetic energy of a gas atom is then equal to the average rotational energy E rot of a grain: 3k 1 2 2: T gas = E rot = 2: I (J)"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"352 Grain alignment Table 11.1.

Indeed, we see from the condition of equipartition (11.13) that Ix < I y < I z implies Lx < L y < L z . For example, in the case of a thin rod (Ix = I y « I z ), almost all angular momentum will reside in rotation perpendicular to the symmetry axis z. The rotational velocity of a dust particle in Brownian motion is _ j3kT gas WBrown - -1-' (11.14) Moments of inertia are given in table 11.1 for a few relevant configurations. Note that Idisk II = !

If we adopt grains of moderate elongation, volume 10- 15 cm- 3 and bulk density 2.5 g cm- 3 , we get, for their Brownian motion, from (11.14) in a gas of 20 K For real interstellar grains, this may be a gross underestimate if they rotate suprathermally (see later). The disorder time tdis of equation (9.39) stays practically the same with respect to angular momentum. The gas atoms that collide with the spinning grain retard its rotation by exerting a torque T.

We mention another randomizing process, besides grain collision, that is always at work: infrared radiation. Each photon carries off a quantum n in an arbitrary direction. After N emission processes, the angular momentum of the grain has changed in a random walk by an amount -IN n. If the grain emits per second NIR infrared photons, the associated disorder time is 8nkTPgr a5 tdis = 5n2 NIR . The expression follows from .jNIRtdisn = lw with Iw 2 = 3kT. This process may dominate over collisional randomization for small grains. Usually the dust is heated by the UV field. In thermal balance, the number of UV photons absorbed per second, Nuv, is typically 50 times smaller than NIR. If one can estimate the mean intensity of the radiation field, for example, from the dust temperature, Nuv follows from 2 [ JvQv Nuv = 4n na -- dv. uv hv Inside a molecular cloud, where only a few energetic photons fly around, the discrepancy between Nuv and NIR is less severe. 11.1.5 Supra thermal rotation An interstellar grain is probably not in energy equilibrium with the gas, as assumed earlier, and its rotational energy may be orders of magnitude greater than ~kTgas. It then rotates much faster than estimated in (11.14) from Brownian motion [Pur79]. To see why, imagine S-shaped grains of mass M gr (figure 11.2) that are cooler than the gas, Tdust < T gas and have a uniform sticking coefficient 17 over their surface. A fraction 17 of the gas atoms, where 0 < 17 < I, stays after the collision for a while on the grain before it leaves with a lower temperature (momentum) than it had before the impact.

As a result, they impart. on average. less momentum to the grain than those striking the bottom half of the S, Therefore, the S will rotate clockwise, Should the grain be hotter than the gas. it will rotate anti-clockwise and, without a temperature gradient, the mechanism does not work at all. The process leads to a spinup. The dust particle rotates faster and faster and a limit is set only by friction when the lateral velocity of points on the grain surface becomes comparable to the velocity of gas atoms. Then each atom transfers approximately the angular momentum l/I a v a a to a grain of radius a.

The sites will not be exactly balanced over the surface and they endow the grain with a net rotation. • Another mechanism is the ejection of electrons by UV photons. The kinetic energy of the ejected electron is typically'\" leV and thus less than the energy h v of the UV photon but the momentum of the electron is a hundred times greater than h v / c. Here again one gets suprathermal rotation if the yield for this process changes over the surface. Even when the accommodation coefficient is perfectly uniform, random excitation, some clockwise and some anticlockwise, speeds up the rotation in the same way as a randomly kicked ball moves with each kick, on average, farther away from its starting position. 11.2 Magnetic dissipation 11.2.1 Diamagnetism When a diamagnetic particle moves in a static inhomogeneous magnetic field in the direction of growing field strength, it experiences a repulsive force. According to the classical explanation, the magnetic flux through the electronic orbits of the atoms in the particle increases during the movement and thus induces an electric field. The field leads to an additional electronic current and to a magnetic moment which points, from the Lenz law, in the opposite direction to the outer magnetic field. The explanation applies to all atoms and, therefore, all matter is, in some way, diamagnetic; however, other effects may override it. The magnetic permeability JL, defined by the relation B = JLH of (1.16), is for a diamagnetic particle a little smaller than one. We will not come across diamagnetism any more. 11.2.2 Paramagnetism Paramagnetism is relevant astrophysically and shows up when atoms have a permanent intrinsic magnetic moment as a consequence of unfilled inner electron shells. The electrons of an unfilled outer shell usually pair in binding and give no effect. A paramagnetic substance is pushed in the direction of increasing field strength, i.e. in the opposite way to a diamagnet and its JL is a little bit greater than one. The atoms with the strongest paramagnetism are the lanthanides. The paramagnetism of interstellar dust is probably due to iron. This element has a high cosmic abundance and must be mostly solid because of its heavy depletion in the gas phase. It can easily be built into silicates, for example olivine, Mg2-xFexSi04, with x not far from one (see section 7.4.4). The amount of silicate grains is presumably limited by the cosmic abundance of Mg, which is some 20% higher than that of iron.

The third (n = 3, M-shell) could accommodate 2n 2 = 18 electrons but contains only 14. There are two more electrons in the 4s subshell, totalling 26. The magnetic moments of the electrons in the third shell do not balance resulting in a net moment and thus paramagnetism. The ground state of atomic iron, as of Fe2+, is 5D4 (D stands for orbital angular momentum L = 2n, the multiplicity is 5 and the total angular momentum J = 4n). The ion Fe3+ has a ground term 6 S5/2 (L = 0, multiplicity 6, J = ~n). An atom of magnetic dipole moment m, oriented under an angle e to a field B, has a potential energy (see (1.l33)) U = -m·B = -mBcose. (l1.l6) Suppose a grain has N such atoms per unit volume.

(11.20) 11.2.3 Ferromagnetism Ferromagnetism appears in certain metals, like Fe, Co and Ni but also in alloys of these elements and some of their oxides. It only shows up below the Curie temperature Te. Iron, the relevant element for us, has a Curie temperature Te = 1043 K, well above any common dust temperature. Crystalline iron possesses a cubic grid. Below 1183 K, the grid is body-centered (a-form), above face-centered (y-form) but this form is, of course, never ferromagnetic. The magnetization M in a ferromagnet is very strong even when the applied magnetic field H a is weak or absent. This is the result of a collective, non- magnetic effect of the electrons. A single iron atom is not ferromagnetic, only a cluster of atoms can show this property. Whereas in paramagnetism only the applied field acts on the electrons and tries to align them, in ferromagnetism there is an additional interaction among the electrons themselves formally described by an exchange field He. This is a fictitious field insofar as it does not appear"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"358 Grain alignment in Maxwell's equations. It exerts on the electrons an apparent force which makes their spins parallel. Ferromagnetism can only be understood quantum mechanically. At its root is Pauli's exclusion principle. One gets an idea of how the exchange field comes about from Heisenberg's theory for just two electrons: The relevant quantity is the exchange integral which occurs because the electrons are indistinguishable and which determines whether the spins are parallel or anti- parallel. The conception of an exchange field He is useful. Let us assume that it is proportional to the magnetization, He = AM. The exchange field is much stronger than the applied field, so the total effective field is Ha+AM ::::: AM. Any attempt to explain the huge magnetization M by the interaction of the magnetic dipoles associated with the electron spins fails by orders of magnitude. Indeed, at the Curie point ('\" 1000 K), where ferromagnetism begins to fail, the kinetic energy of the atoms must be comparable to the potential energy of a Bohr magneton in the exchange field, Therefore we estimate that He to be of order 10 7 G. However, the dipole field of a Bohr magneton at the distance r ~ 2.5 A between neighboring iron atoms is 2JLB/r 3 ~ 10 3 G, or ten thousand times weaker. 11.2.4 The magnetization of iron above and below the Curie point Above the Curie point, iron is paramagnetic and the dependence of the magnetization M on the total field, He + H a , follows Curie's law, C M = - (H a + AM). T As the magnetic susceptibility X combines the applied field H a with the magnetization, M=XHa it follows that C X=T-T c with T c = AC. (I 1.21)"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Magnetic dissipation 359 Here C is the same as in (11.20). We now have a relation between the Curie temperature T e and the magnification factor A. When the temperature approaches T e from above, the susceptibility rises steeply. Equation (11.21), known as the Weiss law, is only approximate. To evaluate the magnetization below the Curie point, we use (11.19), which expresses M as a function of mB / kT but replace B by H a + AM. We then have an equation for M. Solving it, one gets values of M which are different from zero even without an applied field (H a = 0). This phenomenon is known as spontaneous magnetization. With H a = 0, the spontaneous magnetization M as a function of T has its maximum at zero temperature given by the saturation value M sat = Nm when all moments are perfectly aligned. With rising temperature, M falls, first gradually, then rapidly and goes to zero at T = T e . For bulk iron, the effective magnetic moment per atom is m ::::: 2.22 {tB, the number density N = 8.50 x 10 22 cm- 3 , so the saturation magnetization Msat(Fe) ::::: 1750 G. (11.22) This scenario of spatially constant magnetization applies to single domains and thus only to very small particles. In a mono-crystal of iron of only 0.1 {tm size, the magnetization below the Curie point is not uniform over the crystal but divided into small domains. Within each domain, there is almost perfect alignment and the magnetization is close to its saturation value. But in an adjacent domain the magnetization has a different orientation so that the effective Mover the whole crystal may be much lower than M sat , although the susceptibility X is still large. The crystal is partitioned into domains because its total energy, which includes the magnetic field outside the crystal, is then lowest; if the crystal were one big single domain, the total energy would be higher. In a ferromagnet consisting of several domains, X has a complicated behavior depending on the applied field H a and also on the magnetic history. Akin to ferromagnetism is ferrimagnetism, except that the saturation magnetization is much lower. To explain it, one proposes that neighboring electron spins are not parallel, as in a ferromagnet but anti-parallel without fully compensating each other. Some iron oxides that might be found in interstellar grains, like magnetite (Fe304) or maghemite (y-F203), are ferrimagnetic. 11.2.5 Paramagnetic dissipation: spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation After these preliminary remarks about magnetism, we discuss and quantify processes of magnetic damping. The one most frequently evoked for the alignment of interstellar grains is paramagnetic relaxation [Cas38, Dav51, Jon67, Spi79]. There are two thermodynamic systems in a grain:"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"360 Grain alignment (1) The spin system. The ensemble of magnetic moments arises from the electrons of the paramagnetic atoms. The magnetic moments may be due to electron spin as well as orbital angular momentum. In a constant magnetic field of strength H, there is some net orientation of the dipoles. Equilibrium is characterized by a Boltzmann distribution e- u / kTs at temperature Ts, where after (11.16) U = - m H cos e is the potential energy of a dipole of moment m aligned with the field at an angle e. (2) The lattice system. It consists of the vibrating atoms or ions in the grid of the solid body. It is at temperature h, has much more energy than the spin system, serves as a heat reservoir and is always relaxed. In equilibrium, the temperatures of the two systems are equal, Ts = h. When the field is suddenly increased from H to H' > H, while keeping its direction, the spin system gets disturbed. Associated with the two systems are two damping constants: • The spin system comes to equilibrium very quickly at a new temperature T~ after the spin-spin (ss) relaxation time T ss '\" 10- 10 s. This process is adiabatic; there is no heat exchange with the lattice, the level populations of the dipoles stay the same so thatmH/kTs = mH'/kT~. • Equilibrium with the lattice system is established much more slowly after the spin-lattice (sl) relaxation time Tsl '\" 10- 6 s. The coupling between spin and lattice is mediated via phonons; they correspond to changes in the quantum numbers of the lattice vibrations. The above numbers for T ss and Tsl are very crude but certainly T ss « Tsi. While Tsl varies inversely with temperature, T ss is more or less independent of it. For Ts =!= h, heat flows from the lattice to the spin system at a rate -aCTs - h) (a > 0). The heat flow is proportional to the temperature difference dT = Ts - h. It stops when the two temperatures are equal. If the spin system was initially hotter, it will lose energy. Once equilibrium has been established (Ts = h), the dipoles are better aligned in the new stronger field H' and their potential energy U is, therefore, lower than before the disturbance. The excess energy has been transferred to the lattice. 11.2.6 The magnetic susceptibility for spin-lattice relaxation We next calculate the susceptibility for spin-lattice relaxation using the thermodynamic relations for magnetic materials of section 5.3.8. Suppose a bias field Ho has produced a constant magnetization Mo and superimposed onto Ho there is a small periodic perturbation so that the total field and the total magnetization are: H(t) = Ho + he-hut M(t) = Mo +hXe-iwt.

Therefore the susceptibility for spin-lattice relaxation is: XT - Xad XI(W)=Xad+ 1 22 +w T s1 (11.24) The imaginary part X2 stands for the dissipational loss. It is positive, as it should be, because XT = X (0) > Xad = X(oo). At low frequencies, X2 is proportional to w. A look at the permeability of (1.146) confirms that we are dealing with some kind of Debye polarization. After a sudden disturbance, the return of the spin system to equilibrium with the lattice proceeds exponentially on a characteristic time Tsl which is related to the constant ex and the specific heat CH through CH TsI= -. ex The power W which has to be expended for the magnetization of a body in a variable field of the kind given by (11.23) follows from equation (5.63), W = !wVX2h2. Here V is the grain volume. The formula is correct whether a bias field Ho is present or not. It also agrees with the energy dissipation rate (1.55) which we derived before, because in the case of a small susceptibility, X approaches the polarizability ex. However, the very process of dissipation by spin-lattice relaxation does not work for purely paramagnetic interstellar grains. The reason being that the"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"362 Grain alignment bias field Ho is absent. The spinning particles only feel the time-variable part, d H = he-hut, where h is now the interstellar magnetic field. As the grains rotate, the magnetic dipoles have to adjust their precession to a field that changes its direction but not its strength. So their potential energy U in the field and the level populations remain the same. Consequently, the spin temperature Ts does not oscillate, dT = 0, and there is no interaction with the lattice. Nevertheless, our troubles are not in vain. In section 11.3 we will revive spin-lattice relaxation by proposing an internal bias field in the grain material due to ferromagnetic inclusions. 11.2.7 The magnetic susceptibility in spin-spin relaxation The rotation of paramagnetic dust particles may be damped via spin-spin relaxation. The dissipation comes about because the alignment of the dipoles always lags behind the new field direction (see figure 11.5). The underlying microscopic processes are very complex and their treatment is beyond the scope of this text. We merely mention that there is: • a magnetic dipole-dipole interaction (the paramagnetic atoms are the source of a magnetic field in which other magnetic dipoles precess); • Stark splitting of the magnetic sublevels (arising from the electric field of the crystal); • a quantum-mechanical exchange interaction (which tends to make spins parallel as in ferromagnetism); and • a hyperfine splitting interaction (accounting for the influence of the magnetic moments of the nuclei of the paramagnetic atoms). We wish to estimate the values of X(w) for magnetic grain material at the frequencies at which interstellar grains may rotate, i.e. in the range from w = 10 5 S-1 for Brownian motion up to 10 9 S-1 in the case of suprathermal spinup. It is, of course, also of interest to know X (w) at all frequencies and with respect to all dissipation processes so that one can check whether dust absorption or emission due to para- or ferro-magnetism can ever become important (see second term in (3.5)). The magnetic susceptibility X (w) for spin-spin relaxation must have the functional dependence of the Debye permeability after equation (1.147) because the magnetization of the grain is due to orientational alignment of the dipoles in a time-variable field, as discussed in section 1.6. The imaginary part X2(W), which is responsible for dissipation, has, therefore, the form WT X2(W) = XO 1 + W 2 T 2 · (11.25) To extract numbers, one must know XO and T.

Note that the electrons do not precess in the weak interstellar magnetic field but in the much stronger local field Bloc created by all paramagnetic atoms (see section 3.4). This field is, of course, violently fluctuating because the spin directions are tossed about in collisions with phonons. In contrast to the perfect cubic lattice discussed in section 3.4, the paramagnetic atoms are dispersed irregularly over the grain. Their average contributions to Bloc cancel but the root mean square deviation does not vanish. As fields from dipoles fall off quickly and proportionally to r- 3 , only the nearest matter.

So the mechanism is independent of the strength of the magnetic moments and, therefore, includes, besides electronic paramagnetism which we have had in mind so far, nuclear paramagnetism. In particular, hydrogen nuclei, which are building blocks of the otherwise non-magnetic H20 molecules, have unsaturated nuclear moments. They are a grain constituent when the grain has an ice mantle.

This is exemplified, for example, in the figures of [Mat70] for stars with a large distance modulus. One should also note in these figures, however, the large local excursions. As the magnetic field, derived from the polarization of radio synchrotron emission, has the same direction (projected on the sky) as the electric field vector of polarized starlight, it seemed natural to propose that magnetic fields are somehow responsible for the grain alignment. When one compares the magnetic field lines with the optical polarization vectors in other spiral galaxies, the coincidence is less impressive. This is demonstrated in figures 11.3 and 11.4 for M 51, a galaxy which has beautiful spiral arms and is viewed face-on. The magnetic field follows the arms nicely but the optical polarization vectors, especially in the lower right of the figure, match the magnetic field vectors only poorly. The reason that their orientation is not as uniform as in the Milky Way is probably due to the fact that one also sees scattered light in external galaxies. The polarization resulting from scattering by dust is usually strong, especially when it occurs at right angles, and is completely unrelated to magnetic fields. In extinction measurements of the Milky Way, however, scattered light is absent and cannot contaminate the polarization."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"Magneric alignment 365 • - -- 47\"30' • 47\"25' -' Figure 11.3.

This is the Davis-Greenstein mechanism, the standard scenario for magnetic alignment. 11.3.2 Timescales for alignment and disorder We estimate a relaxation time trel for magnetic alignment from the condition Lltrel = dLldt from (11.29): (11.31) A typical number is 10 6 yr. The inverse t;;? is, by order of magnitude, the rate at which the angle e between the field and the angular momentum vector changes. We see that magnetic alignment is favoured by a low ratio of moment of inertia over volume, I I V, and a strong magnetic field. But there are limits to these numbers. A minimal value of I I V is given by a sphere and, from diverse independent evidence, B does not exceed several times 10- 6 G in low density clouds (nH < 10 3 cm- 3 ). Note that a higher rotation speed, although it implies enhanced dissipation, does not decrease the relaxation time trel because X2 ex: (J) at low frequencies.

This implies that the grains change their angular momentum chaotically before paramagnetic relaxation has had time to do its job and they would not be aligned. Therefore one has to search for a more effective magnetic alignment mechanisms. Suprathermal rotation, supra-paramagnetism and ferromagnetic inclusions can bring the ratio of relaxation time over collisional disorder time, trell tdis, down and thus point a way out of the dilemma [Jon67]. 11.32.1 Magnetic alignment in suprathermal rotation Should the grains be rotating suprathermally with angular velocity w » 105 S-I, as discussed in section 11.1, they have a very high kinetic energy and the time to create disorder, tdis, will be much increased and no longer be given by (9.39). As the relaxation time trel of (11.31) is not altered by the spinup as long as X2 ex: w, effective grain alignment according to the Davis-Greenstein mechanism with damping from paramagnetic spin-spin relaxation seems possible. Of course, the angular momentum of the fast rotating particle must stay stable in space over a time greater than trel, otherwise orientation is poor. Because inhomogeneities on the grain surface drive the suprathermal spinup, disorientation will set in when the surface properties change. This may occur, for example, when new layers are deposited or active sites are destroyed or created. Time scales for these processes are debatable. 11.3.3 Super-paramagnetism Interstellar dust may contain not only isolated iron atoms, which would only produce paramagnetism of possibly insufficient strength but also tiny pure iron subparticles in which the collective effect of the electron spins dominate. The subparticles are possibly synthesized in supernova explosions and somehow built into interstellar grains. Even if they contain only a few tens of iron atoms, they"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"(11.34) Magnetic alignment 369 already behave like ferromagnetic single domains, i.e. they show spontaneous magnetization. A grain with such ferromagnetic inclusions may then display super-paramagnetism. The phenomenon is halfway between ferro- and para- magnetism in the sense that the clusters are ferromagnetic single domains but their magnetization changes spontaneously by thermal perturbations so that the grain, as a whole, behaves like a paramagnet. Suppose the grain has Nel iron clusters, each consisting of n atoms of magnetic moment mao The magnetic moment of each cluster is at its saturation value mel = nm a but the whole particle is paramagnetic because its magnetization follows equation (11.17) with the Langevin function L(x). However, in the expression for the static susceptibility (11.26) the moment m a of a single Fe atom has to be replaced by the cluster moment mel and the volume density of magnetic atoms N pm by the number of clusters Nel in the grain. As obviously N pm = Neln, the static susceptibility of the grain as a whole becomes XO = n (N;;;;). Therefore XO increases by a factor n over the static susceptibility with isolated iron atoms. When a cluster changes its magnetization, it must overcome a potential barrier Ubar, because not all directions of magnetization are equal. There is an easy one and a hard one (for iron, these are the cube edges [100] and the body diagonals [Ill], respectively) separated by Ubar. The more atoms there are in the cluster, the higher the barrier, Ubar(= nke) becomes. It may be overcome by thermal excitation and the rate at which this happens is proportional to e- Ubm ! kT. Therefore the relaxation time has the form with e = 0.11 K and y = 10- 9 s determined experimentally. It is very sensitive to the number n of iron atoms per cluster. As n increases, X2 (w) after (11.25) can become very large for small frequencies. 11.3.4 Ferromagnetic relaxation In a more general way, not restricted to paramagnetic relaxation, one assumes that the magnetization M is forced by a periodic outer field H to oscillate harmonically, .. . 2 2 M + Y M + woM = woxoH. (11.33) In a static field, M = xoH. Equation (11.33) implies with T == y I w6 (see (1.77)) WT X2(W) = Xo 2· [1 - (wi wO)2] + W 2 T 2 For small frequencies (w « wo), the expression again approaches Debye relaxation (11.25).

The difficulty is to associate xo, rand wo with physical processes and to determine their values from a combination of experimental data and theory. If the system is critically damped, y = 2wo after (1.63). Then there are only two parameters, XO and r, and (11.35) For a grain with ferromagnetic inclusions, two scenarios exist: • If the iron clusters are big enough to be divided into several domains, the changing magnetic field causes the transition layer between adjacent domains (Bloch walls) to rearrange and the wandering of the walls dissipates energy. The moving walls can phenomenologically be described by a harmonic oscillator, as in (11.33). With the static susceptibility XO = 12 from table 11.2 and an estimate for r of order 10- 8 s from the laboratory, the low-frequency limit of X2(W)/W becomes'\" 10- 7 which is four orders of magnitude greater than for spin-spin relaxation. The effect on the damping of the grain as a whole depends, of course, on the volume fraction /Fe of the iron inclusions but even /Fe = 0.1 % would increase the susceptibility tenfold. • If the iron clusters have sizes below \"'200 A, they are stable as ferromagnetic single domains. One can squeeze out some semi-theoretical number for X2 supposing, as we did for paramagnets, that dissipation comes from precession of the magnetic moments in the local field. The latter is equal to 47T M sa tl3 (see the electric analog in (3.54)). Putting the saturation magnetization M sat = 1750G and XO = 12 (table 11.2), the precession frequency Wpr ::::: r- I ::::: (47T M sa tl3) (e/me c ) ::::: 1.3 x 1011 S-I. As now X2 (w) / w '\" 10- 10 , particles with single-domain iron inclusions seem not to be terribly effective in damping. However, the presence of single-domain ferromagnetic inclusions has the interesting consequence that it provides a bias field Ho for the adjacent paramagnetic material [Dul78]. This enables paramagnetic dissipation by spin- lattice relaxation to operate in the otherwise paramagnetic grain material. This mechanism, which we had so far discarded, is much more efficacious in enhancing the ratio X2 (w) / w than spin-spin relaxation, especially at low frequencies as evidenced by figure 11.6. The field produced by the inclusions must, of course, be as strong as the fluctuating field from the isolated iron atoms in the paramagnetic grain material, for which we estimated above 700 G, in order for the resulting field to be considered at a constant bias.

(11.36) e de de For the alignment to work, it is necessary that til be shorter than the disorder time tdis (see (9.39) for its value for Brownian motion). 11.3.6 Mechanical and magnetic damping We discuss two further dissipation mechanisms: one mechanical, the other gyro magnetic . I I.36.I Mechanical damping via variable stresses Interstellar dust particles are not perfectly rigid bodies and the centrifugal forces in a spinning grain change the distances among the atoms. When rotation is not about a principal axis, the rotation vector w moves with respect to the grain coordinates and so the stresses arising from the centrifugal forces are time variable with frequency of order (J) (see (11.8)). A perfect and cold crystal is very elastic with hardly any loss but a real grain has imperfections and mechanical deformations inevitably drain some of the rotational energy into heat. The previously introduced time til depends on the stiffness of matter, the mechanical damping constant of the grain material and, crucially, on the rotational velocity. It turns out that for suprathermally spinning inelastic grains, til is much shorter than tdis, so they will always rotate about their axis of greatest moment of inertia. Interstellar grains in Brownian motion, however, will probably not show such alignment. 11.36.2 Magnetic damping via the Barnett effect More efficient is a gyromagnetic mechanism which is based on the coupling between the spin system and the macroscopic rotation of the body. To see how it works, we first recall the famous experiments by Einstein and de Haas and its counterpart by Barnett. • When an unmagnetized iron cylinder with inertia I is suddenly magnetized by an outer field, the atomic magnetic moments and their associated angular momenta line up. Suppose that in the process of magnetization, N electrons flip their spin direction from up to down. As the total angular momentum of"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"Non-magnetic alignment 373 the cylinder is zero before and after the magnetization, the cylinder acquires an angular momentum L = Nn and rotates afterwards at a speed w = Nlt/ I (Einstein-de Haas effect). • When an unmagnetized cylinder is rotated at angular velocity w, it feels a magnetic field B, which is parallel to w and has the absolute value 2mec B=w-- e (11.37) The field B then produces, in the cylinder, a magnetization M = XB (Barnett effect). To understand the linear relation (11.37) between w and B, we mention, first, that in a rotating frame K ' the acceleration x' of a point mass is different from the acceleration x as seen in an inertial frame K: x' = x + 2w X x' + w x (w x x). (11.38) The prime refers to the uniformly rotating system in which there additionally appear a Coriolis and a centrifugal term (second and third on the right). When w is small, the centrifugal force may be neglected and one may put v = x ::::: x'. Therefore, when we take an atom and apply a magnetic field and furthermore slowly rotate the atom, each of its electrons is subjected to the additional force: 2mev x w + (e/c)v x B. The first term is due to rotation and the other represents the Lorentz force of the magnetic field. The sum of the two is zero when w + (e/2mec)B = O. Rotating the atom is thus equivalent to exposing it to a magnetic field of strength B = (2mec/e)w; this is Larmor's theorem. When we apply this result to an interstellar grain of volume V and compute the dissipation rate W = X2wB2 after (11.30) with X2 from (11.27) and B from (11.37), we find that the alignment time til in (11.36) is inversely proportional to w 2 and much shorter than the disorder time tdis. 11.4 Non-magnetic alignment We discuss two other ways in which grains may be aligned in the interstellar medium. They are interesting in themselves but except for special configurations, not likely to be responsible for polarization. 11.4.1 Gas streaming When gas streams with a velocity v past a dust particle, for example, in a stellar wind, each atom of mass m endows the grain upon collision with a small angular momentum dL gas = r x my.

Perpendicular to the line of sight, gas streams at supersonic velocity v relative to the grains. Directions are given in the spherical polar coordinates (e, ¢). Cylindrical grains will rotate in planes ¢ = constant and this results in a net orientation of their rotation axes and in polarization of the starlight [GoI52]. If the grain is a rod of length Z, we have, approximately, dL gas = !Zmv. The situation is depicted in figure II.8. Let us choose spherical polar coordinates (8, ¢) so that the direction of streaming is given by 8 = 0 and the direction towards the observer by 8 = n /2 and ¢ = 0 (figure 11.7). Because of the vector product, dL gas lies in the plane 8 = n /2 which is perpendicular to v. If the grain is hit by N atoms, all changes in angular momentum, dL gas , lie in this plane but are randomly distributed there. So the final angular momentum L gas is also in the plane 8 = n /2 and its length is the result of a random walk: L gas = .J\"N. dL gas . When the number N of collisions is large, L gas will be limited by friction with the gas. If the grain is very elongated, the vector r in figure 11.8 falls almost along the x-axis. Therefore the angular momentum is perpendicular to the x-axis which implies that the grain rotates in a plane with ¢ = constant. When there are many particles, all such planes are equally likely, there is no favorite ¢. The observer in figure 11.7 finds that the starlight is polarized.

Observing several transitions simultaneously allows us to infer the conditions of excitation, mainly gas temperature and density. The spectroscopic information from dust, however, is poor. Being a solid, each grain emits very many lines but they overlap to give an amorphous continuum. Moreover, the emission is restricted to infrared wavelengths. The smallest grains, PAHs, which show very characteristic bands are a fortunate exception. Resonances are also observed from silicate material and ice mantles. These features are the topic of the present chapter. Because of the strong disturbance of any oscillator in a solid, the transitions are broad and do not allow us to extract velocity information.

It is given in equation (8.2) as the sum of kinetic and potential ellergy of all atoms which are approximated by hannonic oscillators. The accessible states are in a nalTOW range from E to E + liE. Figure 12.1 illustrates the locus of the states in phase space when the system has only one degree of freedom (j = I). There are then two coordinates, position q and momentum p, and all states lie in an annulus around an ellipse. The oscillating particle is most likely to be found near the greatest elongation, which is at the left and right edge of the ellipse. There the velocity is small and. for a given !:J.q. one finds the highest density of cells. For f > I. the situation is multi-dimensional but otherwise analogous. The population of the cells in phase space is statistical and the probability of finding the ith oscillator of a PAH in quantum state v is, in view of (5.48), Pi,v = peE; i, u)jp(E). peE) is the density of states at energy E and peE: i, u) is the density of states at energy E subject to the condition that oscillator i is in quantum state lJ.

The PAH is built up of three benzene rings; all bonds at its edges are saturated by hydrogen atoms. There are altogether f = 3· (14 + 10) - 6 = 66 degrees of freedom. The vibrational modes can be computed if one knows the force field (force constants) or the potential in the molecule. In the model on which figure 12.2 is based seven vibrational types are considered. Besides the four obvious ones, • CC stretching, • CH stretching,"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"380 PAHs and spectral features of dust anthracene C 14 H lO OL.L-L-'---'---'--'--'--~I\"OOOc:!c--'--'--'--L.L--'---'--;;c2000\"\"''------'------'3;;;OOO'''''--' wavenumber (llern} Figure 12.2. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon anthracene has 66 degrees of freedom. They corre~pond to 66 oscillators (modes), each having its eigenfrequency. The wavenumbers are tabulated in [Whi781 and grouped here into intervals of 100 cm- 1 width. • CC OUI-oF-plane bending and • CH OUI-oF-plane bending, three mixed modes in which several atoms take pazl in the oscillation are also included. These are CCC and CCH bending as well as ecce torsion. The frequencies of the 66 oscillators by which the molecule is replaced are found by introducing nonnal coordinates (section 8.4) and solving equation (8.25). Despite the simplicity of the model. the achieved accuracy is good. the theoretical frequencies agree well with laboratory data. Some vibrational modes lie very close together because of the symmetlY of the molecule. It is clear that atoms in similar force fields must swing in a similar manner. For instance, all CH stretches of the ten hydrogen atoms in anthracene are crowded between 3030 and 3040 em-I. For reasons ofsymmetly, at most four of these CH frequencies can be different but these four are really distinct because they cOITespond to sites where the slllTolmdings of the H atoms have different geometries. The distl'ibution of the number of modes over energy is displayed in figure 12.2. It contains several notewol1hy features: • The modes stl'ongly cluster around 3035 em-I. This range is completely isolated and due to CH stretching. When I( is the force COllstant of CH binding and III the mass of an H atom, the frequency is roughly w = ./1(/11I (see (12.8)). Hydrogen atoms are also involved in the modes around 1000 em-I which are due to a CH bend. • The rest of the histogram is due to the skeleton of carbon atoms and surprisingly smooth. • In section 8,4, we gave the Debye temperatures, e z = 950 K and eX)' = 2500 K, for a graphite plane. Excluding the CH bend at 3000 em-I, the high frequency cutoff, which, by definition, is the Debye frequency, is at"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"Thermodynamics of PAHs 381 1800 cm- 1 and corresponds nicely to e xy (see (8.33)). • At long wavelengths, the modes extend into the far infrared. The lowest energy is 73 cm- 1 (137 /Lm) and again in qualitative agreement with the estimate for the minimum frequency Vmin from (8.45) if one uses e z = 950 K. 12.1.4 Microcanonic versus thermal level population We have learnt how to compute the microcanonic population of levels; this is always the statistically correct way. We now apply our skills to anthracene and check whether, for this PAH, the assumption of thermalization, which when fulfilled makes life so much easier, is permitted. Let the PAH absorb a photon of energy E. When the levels are thermalized, E is equal to the sum of the mean energies of all 66 oscillators (see (5.11)), 66 hv' E='\"' 1. L ehvi/kT - 1 i=l Because all Vi are known, we can calculate from this equation the temperature of a thermalized anthracene molecule of energy E. Figure 12.3 demonstrates that if the PAH has absorbed a typical stellar photon of h v ::::: 4 e V, we may indeed use the Boltzmann formulae (dotted lines) for the level population, and thus also for line emission. For higher photon energies, things only improve. We also learn from the microcanonic results of level populations that those oscillators in thePAH which correspond to the major bands (table 12.1) are mostly found in the lowest quantum numbers, v :s 1. This implies that effects produced by the anharmonicity of the oscillator potential are, to first order, not important. However, if one looks closer, they have to be taken into account. Because of anharmonicity, the spacing between the upper levels decreases and the lines from higher v-states are shifted towards the red. The best example is presented by the C-H stretches at 3.28 /Lm (v = 1 --+ 0, see table 12.1) and at 3.42 /Lm (v = 2 --+ 1). The shift is sufficiently large so that the v = 2 --+ 1 line can occasionally be seen well detached from the v = 1 --+ 0 transition. The v = 2 --+ 1 line is always weaker because of low level population but note that the Einstein A coefficient increases proportionally with v. If the shift due to anharmonicity is small, as for the C-H out-of-plane bend at 11.3 /Lm, the high- v lines blend with the ground transition producing an overall broadening of the band. To estimate how big PAHs behave, we consider a fictitious molecule with 330 degrees of freedom but with the same relative mode distribution as in figure 12.2. There are now for each energy interval five times more modes. We see, from figure 12.4, that for such a big PAH, when it is excited by a photon of 4 eV, the thermal assumption is usually bad. It is acceptable only for low- frequency vibrations, whereas it grossly underestimates the population numbers at short wavelengths. If the photons are more energetic (E > 10 eV), the situation"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"382 PAHs and spectral features of dust ..... , .........• , \" .. .... .... . -.................. - .......... \" .................• 38JLm . 7.5W n ··. \". \\ .. ~ ; .•.• ......• ..... \" . .... .... 2 4 quantum number v \"~ '.

Note that while such a highly excited PAH cools, the assumption ofthennal emission gets poorer. Of course, if the si7-t of the PAH is further increased, it must eventually be thennalized like a nonnal grain. As the PAH gets bigger, the threshold for collisional and pholoexcitalion. l'min after (8.45) and lieu! after (12.5). steadily declines. 12.1.5 Does an ensemble of PAils have a temperature? The concept of temperature is only valid if the system has many degrees of freedom. To an ordinary grain made of N = lOS ... 10 10 atoms. one may cenainly assign a temperature but it is doubtful whether one can do so in the case of a PAH, which may bear more affinity to a big molecule than to a solid body. For example, for a PAH with f = 100 degrees of freedom that is excited to an energy of E =: 10 eV and emits IR photons of 0.1 eV (I3/.tm wavelength), the number of states whose energy does not exceed E is, from (5.41), roughly"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Thermodynamics of PAHs 383 Table 12.1.

This is not a fantastically large number, as it should be for a good temperature but one of order unity. So one has to check in a microcanonic treatment, as before, whether the PAH is approximately thermalized or not. If one cannot assign a temperature to a single PAH, maybe one can to an ensemble of PAHs in the way one assigns a temperature to the level population of an ensemble of gas atoms? At least this is possible when the atoms are in a blackbody radiation field or when their density is high. The excitation then carries the signature either of the Planck function or of Maxwell's velocity distribution and it is completely described by the Boltzmann formula (5.8). However, when exciting events are rare, for example, at low gas density, the levels are not thermalized. The kinetic temperature of the gas does not then describe the population of the internal levels of the atoms. For PAHs, excitation through energetic photons is much too rare an event and gas collisions are negligible altogether. Furthermore, prior to absorption of a photon, the PAH is usually in its ground state.

Their disnibution in energy would not show the spread Iypical of thennal systems but resemble a 8-function. Although the actual exciting photons are not monoenergetic but come from the interstellar radiation field and have a considerable spread. their frequencies do not mimic thennal conditions. 12.2 PAH emission 12.2.1 Photoexcitation of PARs In the diffuse interstellar medium. a neutral PAH molecule is almost all the time in its electronic ground state. a singlet So. Collisions with gas atoms are rare and Ihe gas temperature is too low anyway to thellnalize the PAH. The vibrational modes are. therefore. also in their lowest level. Emission of infrared lines from the PAH molecule is initiated by absorption of a UV photon of energy Euv. say. once a day. Afterwards the molecule is highly excited and in a new electronic singlet state Si. Then various and complicated things happen. very fast. some on time scales of 10- 12 s. But by and large. the outcome is that the ultraviolet energy is thennali7.ed, i.e. disnibuted over all available vibrational modes. and then degraded into infrared photons. mainly by emission in the fundamental modes (see table 12.1). The emission lasts typically for I s. Before the IR photons are emitted. immediately after the UV photon has been"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"PAH emission 385 absorbed, the PAH may change from the electronic state Si without radiative loss to another singlet state. Or it may undergo intersystem crossing to a triplet state. In this case, because the triplet system has a metastable ground level T 1, some of the energy Euv will eventually go into phosphorescence from the triplet Tl to So and thus be lost for the IR features. For a singly photo-ionized PAH, the excitation scheme is similar; only the electronic ground state is then a doublet because of the unpaired electron. A PAH may also be negative or bear multiple charges. The degree and kind of ionization depends on the radiation field, the gas temperature, the electron density and, of course, on the UV cross sections of the PAH; some of the basic ideas are outlined in section 9.2. The ionization details may not be decisive for evaluating the IR emission of PAHs but probably have an influence on the cutoff wavelength and thus on the conditions for excitation (see later). 12.2.2 Cutoff wavelength for electronic excitation There is a minimum photon energy for electronic excitation of a PAH corresponding to a cutoff wavelength Acut. Light from wavelengths greater than Acut is simply not absorbed and thus cannot produce the infrared resonances. For PAHs of circular shape and size (a), one finds empiricallly, in the laboratory, the crude relation Acut = 1630 + 370~ = 1630 + 450(a) (12.4) n = 1,2, .... Here (a) is measured in A and Nc is the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. Small PAHs (Nc < 50) are only excited by UV radiation, larger ones also by optical photons. One can understand the existence of the threshold by considering a free electron in a linear metallic molecule of length L. The electron is trapped in the molecule and its energy levels are given by (6.52), h 2 n 2 E --- n - 8meL2 The phase space available to electrons with energy E :s En is hn /2, so if there are s free electrons, all levels up to n = s are populated; a denser population is forbidden by Pauli's exclusion principle. A transition with /';.n = I has, therefore, the energy dEn I h 2 s h 2 h Vcut = -- /';.n = ---2 = L' dn n=s 4meL 4me( s)L If the atoms have a size of \"'2 A and if there is one optical electron per atom, then L/s = 2 A and 4m (b.)Lc Acut = e s '\" 330L h (12.5)"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"386 PAHs and spectral features of dust This qualitative and simplified model of a linear metallic grain already yields the right order of magnitude for the cutoff. 12.2.3 Photo-destruction and ionization Because the PAHs are so small, absorption of a UV photon can lead to dissociation. In a strong and hard radiation field, PAHs will not exist at all. Because of the anharmonicity of the potential of a real oscillator, an atom detaches itself from the PAH above a certain vibrational quantum number Vdis. The chance P(E) of finding, in a PAH with f degrees of freedom and total energy E, the oscillator i in a state v ::: Vdis is given by equation (12.2), and P(E) is proportional to the dissociation rate kdis(E) of the molecule. In slight modification of (12.2), one, therefore, writes ( E )/- 1 kdis(E) = va I - EO (12.6) va has the dimension of a frequency, Eo may be loosely interpreted as the bond dissociation energy. The two factors, va and Eo, can be determined experimentally. For example, with respect to hydrogen loss, Eo = 2.8 eV and va = 10 16 S-I; with respect to C2H2 loss, Eo = 2.9 eV, va = 10 15 s-I [Joc94]. If hydrogen atoms detach, the aromatic cycles are unscathed, if however acetylene evaporates, the carbon rings are broken. After UV absorption, the excited PAH is hot and has a certain chance to evaporate. When relaxation through emission of IR photons is faster than dissociation, the PAH is stable. The infrared emission rate of PAHs, which is of order 10 2 S-I, can thus be considered as the critical dissociation rate, ker. When kdis (E) > ker, evaporation will occur. k er is associated, from (12.6), with a critical internal energy E er and because E er > Eo, one has, approximately, EO Ink er ::::: In va - (f - 1)-. E er So there is a rough linear relationship between the degrees of freedom of the PAH and the critical energy. As k er enters logarithmically, an exact value is not required. The critical temperature T er can be found from E er via equation (5.11), 1 hVi E er = '\" h jkT, . LeVi cr - I i=1 Ionization after absorption of an energetic UV photon is another reaction channel, besides dissociation and infrared emission, and it has the overall effect of stabilizing the molecule against destruction. Big PAHs are easier to ionize than small ones; the ionization potential of benzene is 9.24 eV and declines to \"'6 eV for molecules with 100 carbon atoms."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"PAH emission 387 For the astronomically relevant question, i.e. under what conditions do PAHs survive in a given, harsh radiation field, one has to balance their destruction rate with the rate at which they are built up by carbon accretion. In the interstellar radiation field (figure 8.2), we estimate that PAHs with only 30 carbon atoms can survive; near an 0 star (distance r = 10 16 cm, L = 10 5 L 0 ), Nc should be above 200. As the physical processes connected with PAH destruction are most complicated, one may be tempted to use a purely phenomenolgical approach and simply assume that PAHs evaporate if the fraction of PAHs above some critical temperature T cr exceeds a certain value fevap, i.e. when (X! peT) dT ::: fevapo iTer The probability function peT) of (8.46) has to be computed anyway for the evaluation of PAH emission. fevap '\" I 0- 8 and T cr '\" 2500 K do not seem to be unreasonable numbers and one may use such an approach to decide whether PAHs evaporate or not. 12.2.4 Cross sections and line profiles of PARs A PAH has several hundred vibrational modes but one typically detects only half a dozen major resonances around the frequencies where the strong modes cluster. Table 12.1 compiles their vibrational type, center wavelength and integrated line strength but it also lists some of the weaker or minor resonances which are, however, more variable in intensity from source to source and their origin is less clear. The most prominent representative of the minor features is the band at 3.4 !Lm which was mentioned in section 12.1.4. It is not listed in table 12.1 because it is an overtone. There are two classes of bands: one involves hydrogen atoms, which are all located at the periphery of the PAH; the other only carbon atoms. The strength of the emission is, therefore, proportional either to NH or Nc, the number of hydrogen and carbon atoms, respectively. As the total amount of absorbed and emitted energy is determined solely by the carbon skeleton, a PAH without hydrogen atoms will have weaker C-C bands than one with hydrogen atoms (and the same Nc). We approximate the line shapes by Lorentzian profiles (see (1.l06)), (12.7) where Vo = ciAo is the center frequency, aint = f a(A) dA the cross section of the particular band integrated over wavelength, and N the number of C or H atoms, respectively. The damping constant y determines the band width and is probably the result of an overlap of many transitions with frequencies clustering around vo."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"388 PAHs and spectral features of dust Figure 12.5. In a PAH, hydrogen atoms are attached to the edge of the carbon skeleton. The exact frequency of the C-H out-of-plane bend depends on whether the hydrogen atoms are isolated (mono positions) or whether there are two (duos), three (trios) or four (quartets) adjacent H atoms. Due to the coupling between the vibrating H atoms, the center wavelength increases from approximately 11.3 to 13.6 /Lm (see table 12.1). The number of neighboring H atoms is indicated for each (peripheral) carbon ring. 12.3 Big grains and ices A few infrared resonances can also be observed in grains of normal size. They allow us to identify certain characteristic groups in molecules of which the grains are made, for example OH in water molecules when water has frozen out. The features are grain-size independent and serve as a tool to unravel the chemical composition of interstellar dust. Let us consider the vibrations in a characteristic group that consists of just two molecules. In a simplified picture, the fundamental frequency (J) between two atoms of mass m 1 and m2 connected by a spring of force constant K is given by where the reduced mass is (J) = 27T V = J K / JL (12.8) JL = mlm2 . (12.9) ml +m2 The frequency is high when the molecules are strongly coupled and the masses of the involved atoms small. For example, the stretching mode of the light CH molecule occurs at \"'3 JLm, for the heavier CN, the resonance is at '\" I 0 JLm. Likewise, in a single C-C bond, the stretching band lies at '\" 10 JLm, in a triple C=C bond at \"'5 JLm. The resonance is broad in an amorphous material, and fairly sharp in a crystal where high structural order leads to long-range forces. Its width and center frequency depend weakly on temperature: when the solid cools, the force constant K and thus the frequency v in (12.8) increase because the lattice shrinks. At the same time, the feature becomes narrower because collisional damping with neighboring atoms is reduced."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"Big grains and ices 389 12.3.1 The silicate features and the band at 3.4 /Lm The most prominent and widely studied resonance is the one at 9.7 /Lm due to an Si-O stretching vibration in silicates. It is the strongest indicator of silicon in space. Towards star-forming regions, it is observed in absorption, towards oxygen-rich mass loss giants it is seen in absorption and occasionally in emission. At around 18 /Lm, there is an O-Si-O bending mode which is weaker and much more difficult to observe from the ground because of atmospheric attenuation; the absorption coefficient ratio KlS/ KIO ::::: 0.5. To derive the ratio of the visual to the 9.7 /Lm optical depth, TV/T9.7, one measures the extinction through a cloud that lies in front of a carbon star. In these stars, all oxygen is bound in CO and silicate grains are absent.

Knowing the ratio TV /T9.7, one can determine the visual extinction A v from the 10 /Lm absorption, provided there are no hot grains along the line of sight that emit themselves at 9.7 /Lm. The method still works when stellar photometry is no longer possible. For example, from the depression of the 10 /Lm feature in figure 12.6 we estimate that the object IRS9 in NGC 7538 suffers about 35 mag of visual extinction corresponding to T9.7 ::::: 2. Another feature that is widely observed in absorption in the diffuse medium but, quite interestingly, absent in molecular clouds is the one at 3.4 /Lm. It is usually attributed to an aliphatic (the carbon atoms are arranged in a chain, and not in a ring) C-H stretching mode, for example, in CH3 but its exact identification has not yet been settled. 12.3.2 Icy grain mantles Ice mantles form in cold and dense molecular clouds as a result of gas accretion onto refractory cores (section 9.1). To stay on the grain and not to become photodesorbed, they have to be well hidden from the UV radiation field. For instance, the 3.1 /Lm feature due to OH stretching seems to require shielding by more than 8 mag of visual extinction. The mantles consist of a mixture of molecules like H20, CO, C02, CH30H, NH3, CH4, ... in varying abundance ratios. An impressive example of absorption by ice mantles is presented in figure 12.6. The vibrational spectrum of diatomic molecules in an ice mantle has several peculiarities. For free molecules, in a gas, there is generally an R- and a P-branch, each consisting of many rotational lines (see section 14.2.1 and figure 14.1). In a solid, the atoms are squeezed in by other molecules and cannot rotate freely, so these branches are supressed.

It will be applied in chapter 16 to compute the spectral energy distribution of dusty astronomical objects. A dozen of rival dust models can be found in the literature. They are all capable of explaining the basic data on extinction, polarization. scattering and infrared resonances and. if employed in radiative transfer calculations. yield successful matches to observed spectra. Our model certainly does not produce superior fits. its advantage, if any, lies in its relative simplicity. It uses published sets of optical constants, without modifying them at certain wavelengths to improve fits. The grains have the simplest possible structure and shape: they are uncoated spheres.

All major dust models agree, in principle, on the solid state abundances, the approximate grain sizes and the minimum number of dust components: one needs PAH-ike particles, very small grains with temperature fluctuations and big grains consisting mainly of silicate and carbon. Such concensus on important issues does, however, not insure against common error. None of the models is certain because hard checks on their validity are missing. Interstellar grains are not within our reach and we cannot verify our assumptions in the laboratory. Differences between models show up mostly in the details of the chemical composition (mixing of components, coating, degree of fluffiness, fraction of built in refractory organic compounds). All models can be refined by varying the shape, size and optical constants of the grains. This further enhances the agreement with observational data but does not necessarily bring new insight. A more promising attempt is to increase the internal consistency of the models. Steps in this direction have been undertaken with respect to the smallest particles (PAHs and vsg) by computing grain properties, such as enthalpy and vibrational modes, under the assumption of a likely grid structure for the atoms ([DraOl] and [LiOl])."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"392 PAHs and spectral features of dust .....

The temperature of the PAHs also fluctuates violently and has to be calculated according to the recipes of section 8.5. In estimating PAH properties. we widely follow [Sch93].

In the far infrared, at A > 25 /Lm, one expects a continuum (see the smooth frequency distribution in the modes of even a small PAH in figure 12.2) and C A should fall off like A -m with m between one and two. However, this continuum is usually swamped by the emission from big grains and not observable. The absorption coefficient of PAHs per gram of interstellar matter is displayed in figure 12.7. Assuming that helium accounts for 28% of the gas mass, these cited abundances for all three dust components (big grains, vsg, PAHs) imply a total dust-to-gas mass ratio in the diffuse medium of Rd = I : 140. 12.4.2 Extinction coefficient in the diffuse medium Figures 12.8 and 12.9 further quantify our dust model. We use only four particles sizes for the big aC grains, four for the big Si grains and two for the very small grains. Nevertheless, the reproduction of the interstellar extinction curve is not bad. The deficit in the far UV is irrelevant for all models of infrared sources where the observer does not receive far UV radiation. 12.4.3 Extinction coefficient in protostellar cores We extend our dust model to cold protostellar clouds. There grains are modified with respect to the diffuse interstellar medium by coagulation and by ice mantles. Consequently, their size increases and the dust mass doubles (Rd = I : 70), possibly even triples (see discussion on icy and fluffy grains in section 2.6). The effect of all three processes (fluffiness, frosting and grain growth) on the particle cross sections is investigated in section 2.6.4 and 2.6.5. In figure 12.10, we compute the mass extinction coefficient of dust that consists of such icy and porous grains. The particles are spheres and have a size distribution n(a) ex: a- 3 . 5 with lower limit a_ = 0.03 /Lm = 300 A; the upper limit a+ is varied. All grains are fluffy and composed of four components: silicate (Si), amorphous carbon (ae), ice and vacuum. Average optical constants are calculated from the Bruggeman mixing rule (section 2.6). In all grains, the ice mass is equal to the mass of the refractory components, Si plus aC, whereas the ice volume is 2.5 times bigger than the volume of Si plus aC. The vacuum fraction is always constant, rae = 0.5. Silicate has twice the volume of carbon, fSi lfaC = 2. The PAHs have disappeared and are dirty spots in the ice mantles. Without UV radiation, the vsg are irrelevant. The optical constants of silicate and amorphous carbon are from figure 7.19, for ice from the tables of [Ber69] and [Leg83]. Several ice resonances are visible, for instance, the one at 3.1 /Lm. The curve marked a+ = 0.3 /Lm is an educated guess for dust in protostellar clouds before it is warmed up by the star and the ices evaporate. When the grains are very big, as in stellar disks, the lines with a+ = 30 /Lm or 3 mm might be appropriate."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"Chapter 13 Radiative transport This chapter deals with the transfer of radiation in a dusty medium. For example, when one observes a star-forming region, most photons created within it do not reach us on a straight path but are scattered, absorbed and re-emitted before they are collected in the telescope. To extract from the observational data the full information on the physical conditions in the star-forming region, one has to understand how the photons propagate within the source. We summarize the elements of radiative transfer, discuss the general transfer equation and sketch how to derive, for a homogeneous medium, estimates on temperature, density and masses. We present a set of equations for spherical dust clouds that treats radiative cooling and heating in an energetically consistent way and outline how to solve it numerically. We append solution strategies of radiative transfer for two other astronomically relevant geometries: dusty accretion disks and a dust-filled star clusters, both of which can, under minor assumptions, be handled in one dimension. Finally, we also discuss the radiative transport in molecular lines because line observations are always complementary to dust observations when investigating stars in their making. 13.1 Basic transfer relations 13.1.1 Radiative intensity and flux The intensity Iv (x, e) is the fundamental parameter describing the radiation field.

Both K~xt and tv refer to unit volume and their dimensions are cm- I and erg S-I cm- 3 Hz- I steel, respectively.

When light travels from point SI to point S2, its value is given by the integral (13.7) so along the line of sight An object of low optical depth (T « 1) is transparent and radiation reaches us from any internal point. An object of large optical depth (T » 1) is opaque and we can only look at its surface and do not receive photons from its interior.

The observed intensity diminishes exponentially with optical depth. • Pure emission without extinction (K~xt = 0). This situation applies quite well to submillimeter radiation from an interstellar dust cloud, now 1 v (s) = 1 v (0) + is tv(S') ds'. Without a background source (lv(O) = 0), which is the standard scenario, and for constant emission coefficient tv, the observed intensity grows linearly with the path length s. • Emission plus absorption.

Equation (13.14) is only a formal solution to the transfer equation (13.9). The hard part is to find the source function Sv(r) in formula (13.14). If Sv(r) is constant, it may be taken out from under the integral yielding (13.15)"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"400 Radiative transport 131.2.3 A dust cloud of uniform temperature In a dust cloud, emission occurs only in the infrared. At these wavelengths, grain scattering is practically absent. For dust at temperature T, the source function is then equal to the Planck function at that temperature, Towards a uniform cloud of optical depth Tv, one, therefore, observes, according to (13.15), the intensity (13.16) If the background is a point source of flux F v (0), one receives, out of a solid angle Q, the flux (13.17) When the background is absent or its spectrum known and multi-frequency observations are available, equation (13.17) yields an estimate of the source temperature and its optical depth, and thus its mass. The limiting solutions to (13.16) are: 1 ( ) = { Bv(T)T v + 1 v (0) for Tv « I v T Bv(T) for Tv » 1. (13.18) They imply that without a background source and if the cloud is translucent (T « I), the intensity is directly proportional to the optical depth: doubling the column density, doubles the strength of the received signal. In this case, the intensity 1 v carries information about the amount of dust but also about the spectral behavior of the grains via the frequency dependence of the optical depth. However, if the source is opaque (T » I), all information about the grains is wiped out and the object appears as a blackbody of temperature T. 13.1.3 The brightness temperature Observations at wavelengths greater than 100 !Lm fall in the domain of radioastronomy. There it is common to replace the intensity 1 v by the brightness temperature Tb which is defined through (13.19) Bv(T) is the Planck function. Because Tb expresses an intensity, it depends, of course, on wavelength, the only exception is a blackbody for which Tb is independent of v. Although Tb is not a direct physical quantity, its use offers practical advantages: • One now has for the intensity handy numbers in a simple unit (Kelvin), instead of weird numbers in awkward units."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"Basic transfer relations 401 • When the source is optically thick, Tb generally, but not always, indicates its physical (thermodynamic equilibrium) temperature. • At low frequencies (hv/ kTb « 1), in the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation, the brightness temperature Tb is directly proportional to the observed intensity, Tb = I v c 2 /2kv 2 . When we put in equation (13.15) Sv(r) = Bv(T), the brightness temperature of a source of optical thickness r becomes (13.20) In the case of dust, T is the grain temperature Td, in the case of line radiation, T is the excitation temperature T ex (see (13.66)). 13.1.4 The main-beam-brightness temperature of a telescope The quantity in which radioastronomers express the strength of a signal, especially in the case of line radiation, is the main-beam-brightness temperature T mb. To understand it, we have to briefly discuss the standard measuring apparatus in radioastronomy. It consists of a parabolic antenna with a detector at its focus. For the moment, we replace the detector at the focus by an emitting device, as in a radar antenna. Let P (tf, ¢) denote the flux emitted by the antenna in the direction of the sky coordinates (tf, ¢ ). The normalized function is called the antenna pattern and determines the telescope beam. In the direction (tfo, ¢o), which is parallel to the normal of the antenna surface, P(tf, ¢) attains its maximum value P max ; one may, of course, always use sky coordinates such that (tfo, ¢o) = (0,0). The antenna pattern is the result of diffraction phenomena. Fortunately, most of the power is emitted into the main beam, in directions close to the normal of the antenna surface; however, some radiation is spilled into the side lobes. In a one-dimensional analog, the situation can be compared to the diffraction pattern on a screen behind an illuminated slit: the intensity has a central maximum and the range around it down to the first zero points on both sides corresponds to the main beam of a telescope. The total solid angle of the antenna is defined by (13.21) with dQ = sin tf dtf d¢ (see (2.2)). Likewise one defines the solid angle of the main beam, Qmb, where the integral extends only over the main beam, and, therefore, Qmb < QA. Now we return to the common occupation of astronomers: they do not send messages into space but receive radiation from there. Note that, according to the reciprocity theorem of section 3.5.5, the spatial distribution of the electromagnetic"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"402 Radiative transport field does not change when one switches from emission to reception. Let B (tf, ¢) be the intensity distribution on the sky and let us assume that the influence of the atmosphere of the Earth on B (tf, ¢) has been eliminated, either because the telescope is flying on a satellite or, if it stands on the ground, by way of calibration. The observed brightness Bobs is then the following mean over the main beam: fQ B(tf, ¢)P(tf, ¢) dQ B - _rn\"\"b'-;;-- _ obs - f Qrnb p (tf, ¢) d Q It is converted into the main beam brightness temperature, T mb, by setting it equal to the Planck function, Bobs = Bv(Tmb) or to its Rayleigh-Jeans approximation, Bobs = T mb2kv2 / c 2 . It is often necessary to state explicitly which conversion is used. The main-beam-brightness temperature Tmb is also called the antenna temperature, denoted TA, although historically the definition of TA was somewhat different. It is justified to say that the antenna temperature constitutes the high- tech counterpart to stellar magnitudes (section 7.3), equally fathomless in its subtleties. The major reason why TA evades a precise determination lies in the fact that the telescope picks up a little bit of radiation from everywhere, even from the kitchen of the observatory. To account for it, any ambitious calibration attempt, therefore, requires the introduction of an efficiency 1]kitch, on top of a dozen other 1]s. In practice, astronomers do not worry about this and pretend to have all 1]S under control. Nevertheless, one should be aware that the absolute calibration accuracy at I mm wavelength is, at best, 5% and in the submillimeter range, at best, 10%. The main-beam-brightness temperature Tmb and the brightness temperature Tb are related, as they should be when names are so similar. When a source of constant brightness temperature Tb subtends a solid angle Qs much bigger than the solid angle QA of the antenna, one measures Tmb = Tb. If, however the beam is much larger than the source (QA » Qs), and then the antenna temperature increases when one uses a smaller beam, although the received physical power does not change with Qmb. 13.2 Spherical clouds The dust emission of a cloud is observed at various wavelengths with the goal of deriving its internal structure. The observational data consist either of maps or of single point measurements towards different positions on the source obtained with different spatial resolution. When the cloud is heated from inside by a star,"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"Spherical clouds 403 it is obviously inhomogeneous and estimates of the dust column density and temperature based on the assumption of a uniform cloud (see (13.17)) are no longer acceptable. A more refined model is needed. Easy-to-model geometrical source configurations are infinite slabs, infinite cylinders and spheres. The structure of the medium then depends only on one spatial coordinate, the problem is one-dimensional. The radiative transfer may be solved in many ways and fast and efficient public computer codes exist. In practice, however, one may encounter difficulties using a public code because it usually has to be modified to meet the demands of a specific astronomical problem. It may then be better to write a code oneself, even at the expense of less professionality. We now present the equations and sketch the numerical strategy for such an endeavour in spherical symmetry. 13.2.1 Moment equations for spheres In a spherical cloud, the dust density per), the dust temperature T(r), the mean radiative intensity Iv (r) and the flux F v (r) are only functions of distance r to the cloud center. However, the basic quantity, the frequency-dependent intensity I, also depends on direction e, where e is the inclination angle to the radial vector, so altogether I = Iv(r, e). Putting JL = cos e, we obtain, from (13.4) and (13.5), for the mean intensity and the flux: Iv = ! II Iv(JL) dJL -I F v = 2n II Iv(JL)JLdJL. -I (13.22) (13.23) (4n/c)I v is the radiative energy density. Iv and F v are the zeroth and first moment of the intensity. The second moment reads I (13.24) In the case of an isotropic radiation field, Iv = Iv and the net flux is zero, F v = O. Then the ratio K v fv= - Iv which is called the Eddingonfactor, equals ~ and the quantity (4n/c)K v gives the radiation pressure. It is a simple exercise to show that for spherical symmetry I Note that volume coefficients for absorption, scattering and extinction are denoted by the slightly different symbol K v."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"404 Radiative transport equation (13.6) becomes a/v 1 - {t2 a/v ext {t-+---=-K / +E. ar r a{t v v v (13.25) (13.26) Multiplying (13.25) by {to = 1 and integrating over all directions gives 1 d 2 ext 2-(r F v )=-4nI v K v +4nE v . r dr This equation looks much simpler than (13.25) because there is no dependence on the angle {to However, we cannot solve it for Iv(r) because it contains the new variable Fv(r).

The introduction of the next higher moment (multiplication of (13.25) by {t2) will not remedy the situation, either. Instead, to be able to use formulae that do not depend explicitly on the direction angle {t, one needs physical guidance. For instance, for low optical depth, the radiation field is streaming radially outwards and Iv = K v = F v l4n. For high optical depth, the radiation field is isotropic and Iv = ~. 13.2.2 Frequency averages One can radically simplify the numerical problem by taking frequency averages. Mean values for the extinction coefficent K v in the case of low and high optical depth are found in the following way: • In an optically thick configuration, where the mean intensity Iv is close to the Planck function Bv(T), one uses the Rosseland mean KR(T) defined through f -L aBv(T)d K v aT v f aBv(T)d . aT v As f Bv(T) dv = aT 4 In, where a is the radiation constant of (5.80), the denominator in (13.28) equals 4aT 3 In. The Rosseland mean gives the greatest weight to the lowest values of K v , as in a room darkened by thick curtains: it is not their thickness but the open slits between them that determine how much light enters from outside. If F v is the energy flux at frequency v per unit area and time, the definition of KR in equation (13.28) must be, and indeed is, although not evident at first glance, equivalent to"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"(13.29) Spherical clouds 405 For example, the equation for the radiative energy transport in the stellar interior may be approximated by using the average opacity KR and assuming Iv = Bv(T) and Iv = ~.

It is now not a question of which frequency penetrates deepest, they all do. Instead one has to take the average over the emitted energy, (13.30) Using the approximation K v = Kov m , which is fine for interstellar dust (section 8.2), one may compute the coefficients analytically. For m = 2, one gets a quadratic increase with temperature, (13.31) The two values are astonishingly close. When we put for the absorption efficiency Qv = 10-23 av 2 after (8.10), where a is the grain radius in cm, and let KR refer to I g of interstellar matter, Ko = 7.5 x 10- 24 R/ Pgr. A dust-to-gas ratio Rd = 0.01 and a matter density Pgr = 2.5 g cm- 3 leads to KR '\" 3 x 1O- 4 T 2 cm 2 per gram of interstellar matter. (13.32) The Rosseland mean opacity may be acceptable in protostellar cocoons or accretion disks, the Planck mean Kp may be used to assess the effective optical depth of clumps in a molecular cloud. As grains in early-stage protostellar condensations are probably fluffy and possess ice mantles (section 2.6), it may be better under such conditions to use the enhanced estimate (13.33) 13.2.3 Differential equations for the intensity We give here a set of equations for the intensity that retains the full information on frequency and direction. Our choice of coordinates is illustrated in figure 13.2. Light is propagating at constant impact parameter p parallel to the z-axis either to the left (I;;) or to the right (It).

In view of the symmetry of the spherical cloud, (13.34) and (13.35) have to be solved only in the right-hand quadrant of figure 13.2, i.e. for z > O.

Solving (13.39) and (13.40) is not eneough, one still has to determine the dust temperature. One arrives at a full solution to the radiative transfer problem iteratively. Suppose that after iteration cycle i we approximately know the grain temperature T(r), the mean intensity of the radiation field Iv(r), and thus after (13.10) the source function Sv(r).

The accuracy is then proportional to the square of the step size h. In Simpson's rule (quadratic interpolation), it is proportional to h 4 and that is worse when the grid is coarse. • The iterations converge when the changes of the temperature ~ T (r) become smaller with each new cycle. As a check on the accuracy of the calculations, one can compute, for each radius r, the net flux 47T iT Fv(r) = 2 P vv(p, r) dp. r a (13.44) This formula can be derived from (13.23) and (13.42). The integrated flux through a shell of radius r is L(r) = 47Tr 2 f F v dv. If the cloud has a central star of luminosity L*, the condition L(r) = L* should be numerically fulfilled everywhere to an accuracy of '\" I %. • Without an embedded source, heating comes from an outer isotropic radiation field of intensity Iav. The integrated flux L(r) is then zero because what enters at the cloud surface must also leave. Nevertheless, the dust may be quite hot, especially in the outer envelope. Numerically, IL(r)1 should now be small compared to 47T R 2 7T f Iav dv which is the total flux from the external radiation field through the cloud surface. • To select a sufficiently fine radial grid which is also economical in terms of computing time, the number of points and their spacings must be adapted during the iterations. For example, in a cloud of 50 mag of visual extinction with a central hot star, the dust column density between neighboring grid points must be small near the star because UV radiation is absorbed very effectively. At the cloud edge, however, there are only far infrared photons and the grid may be coarse. Generally speaking, as one recedes from the star, the radiation field softens and the mean free path of the photons increases. At each radius r, there therefore exists a cutoff frequency with the property that only photons with v < Vcut are energetically relevant, whereas those with v > Vcut, whose mean free path is, as a rule of thumb, shorter, are unimportant. Vcut may be defined by and computed from 1 00 Jv(r) dv = a [00 Jv(r) dv Veut Jo (a '\" 0.2)."},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"Passive disks 409 Choosing the radial step size in such a way that the optical depth at the cutoff frequency is of order 0.1 automatically ensures that the grid is fine only where necessary. • Very close to the star, dust evaporates. The exact radius r evap is part of the solution of the radiative transfer; it depends, of course, on the grain type. To account for dust evaporation, one may evaluate the grain temperature Td in the local radiation field and add a flag at all radii to each grain type indicating whether Td is above or below the evaporation threshold T evap . The flag then controls whether the grain contributes in the next cycle to the extinction and emission or not. For heavily obscured sources (Av > 20 mag), the exact value of the evaporation radius has little influence on the spectrum, if at all, only in the near infrared. • For N radial grid points TJ = R*, r2, r3, ... , rN = R, there are N + I impact parameters Pi = ri with i = I, ... , N and PO = O. Because to first order the intensity over the stellar disk does not change, one needs only two impact parameters (p = 0 and P = R*) for the star. The second radial grid point r2 should only be a tiny bit (0.1 %) bigger than TJ. • The dust temperature Td is computed from (8.8). Let Tj be the value of the grain temperature in iteration cycle j. Writing (8.8) in the form where a is the radiation constant of (5.80) and Q(T) is defined by - f Q~bs Bv(T) dv Q(T) = f Bv(T) dv one gets an improved estimate Tj + 1 for the new iteration cycle j + I from Tf+l = Tf f Q~bsJvdv/Q(Tj).

To obtain the total flux that an observer receives when he views the disk under a certain angle eobs, one has to solve the radiative transfer at all radii r and then sum up the contributions. Furthermore, one has to include the direct emission from the star, and possibly apply a correction for foreground extinction. I33I.1 Disks of high optical thickness When the opacity in the vertical direction is large, as happens in young stellar disks where A v is 10 4 mag or greater, one may encounter numerical difficulties. We then recommend the following strategy: Divide the disk in its vertical structure into a completely opaque mid layer sandwiched between two thin top layers (figure 13.4). The optical depth of the top layer in the z-direction is chosen to be sufficiently large for all starlight, including the scattered part, to become absorbed but small enough so that all re-emitted radiation, which has infrared wavelengths, can leave; a typical value would be A v '\" 5 mag. Let fv be the monochromatic stellar flux that falls in z-direction on the disk (see (13.47)). The integrated incident flux in the z-direction is then f* = f fv dv . Without scattering, all the flux f* is absorbed in the top layer and then re- emitted. Half of it will penetrate into the mid layer, the other half will leave the top layer into space. The mid layer is assumed to be isothermal at temperature T mid, so that the radiative transfer inside it is very simple (see (13.16)). One can immediately write down the intensity that enters the top layer from below under the direction JL = cos e, I;;(z = 0, JL) = Bv(Tmid)· [1 - e'v(fL)].

Many galactic nuclei have large infrared luminosities as a result of intemal activity. Its origin may be either rapid star fonnation or accretion onto a massive black hole. In both cases. the hard primary radiation. from the star or the black hole. is convel1ed into infrared photons by dust. When the luminosity of the black hole dominates. one may. to first order. approximate it by a spherical central source with a power-law emission spectrum and use the fOimalism outlined in section 13.2 for single stars. However. when the luminosity comes from a star cluster. the configuration is intrinsically three· dimensional because the dust temperature varies not only on a large scale with galactic radius r, which is the distance to the center of the stellar cluster but also locally with the separation to the nearest star. This circumstance must be taken into account in some approximate manner. Loosely speaking. the temperature of a grain located in the immediate vicinity of a star is detennined by the distance to and the properties of that star. whereas a grain at the same galactic distance but not very close 10 any star. absorbs only the mean interstellar radiation field j~SRF(r) and will thus be cooler. The spherical symmetry is broken on a small scale because the sUl1\"Oundings of a star constitute a hot spot (abbreviated HS) in the interstellar medium. Their presence significantly changes the spectral appearance of a galactic nucleus. Let us assume that the hot spots are spheres. each with a star of monochromatic luminosity Lv at the center. It turns out that their total volume fraction is small, so they are distributed over the galactic nucleus like raisins in a"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"(13.55) 416 Radiative transport cake. The radius R HS of a hot spot is determined by the condition that outside, a dust grain is mainly heated by the interstellar radiation field (ISRF), whereas inside, heating by the star dominates. If Tv is the optical depth from the star to the boundary of the hot spot, R HS follows from f ISRF d - 1 f -Tv d QvJvv - (47TRHS)2 QvLv ev . This equation can readily be generalized to a mixture of dust grains. The radius R HS of a hot spot is a function of galactic radius r, but it depends, of course, also on the monochromatic stellar luminosity Lv, the dust distribution within the hot spot, and on the grain type via the absorption efficiency Qv. 13.4.2 Low and high luminosity stars It is useful to divide the stars in a galactic nucleus into two categories, each containing identical objects. Stars of the first class have small or moderate luminosity, a space density n * (r) and a monochromatic and bolometric luminosity L~ and L *, respectively, where L* = f L~dv. They represent the population of old stars. Stars of the second class are of spectral type 0 and B. They are young and luminous and were formed in a starburst. The corresponding values are denoted nOB (r), L~B and LOB. • The low luminosity stars are very numerous, altogether typically 10 9 , and the contribution of their hot spots to the overall spectrum may be neglected. To see why, consider a nucleus of integrated luminosity L uue containing N identical stars of luminosity L *. When we fix L uue = N L * but increase N and thus lower L *, the intensity of the interstellar radiation field in the galactic nucleus is, to first order, independent of N. In view of the definition for R HS in (13.55), one finds that R HS ex: -JL* ex: N- 1 j2. Therefore, the total volume N(R HS )3 of all hot spots decreases as N- 1 j2. A large population of low-luminosity stars may be smeared out smoothly over the galactic nucleus and the structure of their hot spots need not be evaluated. To account for the radiation of these stars, one only has to introduce in the numerator of the source function (13.56) the volume emission coefficient r~(r) = n*(r) . L~. If the stellar atmospheres are blackbodies of temperature T*, one may put L~ ex: Bv(T*). Note that L~ need not be specified, only the product r~(r) = n*(r). L~. • The OB stars, however, are very bright and not so numerous. There are rarely more than 10 6 in a galactic nucleus and their space density nOB(r)"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"Galactic nuclei 417 is moderate, typically one star per pc 3 or less in the starburst region. The emission of their hot spots is not negligible and has to be evaluated explicitly. Before solving the radiative transfer on a large scale in the galactic nucleus, one has to determine the luminosity L~s(r) emerging from a hot spot. The frequency integral f L~sdv is, of course, equal to the luminosity LOB = f L?Bdv of a single OB star but L?B and L~s are different because much of the hard stellar UV flux is converted by dust into infrared radiation. To obtain L~s (r), we calculate for each galactic radial grid point the radiative transfer of a spherical cloud centrally heated by an OB star. The cloud radius R HS is determined from (13.55). The hot spot is illuminated at its edge by an interstellar radiation field (ISRF), which fixes the outer boundary condition (13.36); at the inner boundary, we use (13.38) with the flux from the surface of the OB star. The volume emission coefficient due to the hot spots is Altogether, the source function in a spherical galactic nucleus with isotropic dust scattering becomes (see (13.10)) (13.56) It is straightforward to generalize to a dust mixture with different temperatures Td and to include small grains with temperature fluctuations. One then solves with this source function the integral equations (see (13.39) and (13.40)) I(r) = I(O)e- r + 1 r S(x)e-(r-x) dx (13.57) for the spherical nucleus as a whole. This is done along lines of constant impact parameter for the intensities in positive and negative direction, 1+ and 1-. They yield the mean intensity J ~SRF (r). The inner boundary condition is now always 1+ = r and, at the outer edge, r = 0 (see (13.36) and (13.37)). As the galactic nucleus in this model consists of two phases, a dusty medium interspersed with hot spots, equation (13.57) is not strictly correct. It gives, however, a good approximation as long as the volume fraction y of the hot spots, is small; y(r) shrinks when nOB(r) becomes large. For typical space densities of OB stars in starburst nuclei, y is of order 10- 3 ."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"418 Radiative transport 13.5 Line radiation 13.5.1 Absorption coefficient and absorption profile In a gas of atoms or molecules, line radiation arises from transitions between discrete energy states. Consider the levels j and i with statistical weights gj, gi, energies E j > Ei, and population numbers n j, ni. The center frequency v ji of the line is at hVji = Ej - Ei. The basic equation of radiative transfer (13.6), dI v - = -KvI v +E v ds is still valid but K v refers now only to absorption. Scattering of the kind that an atom absorbs a photon from level i to j and then returns to the same i is treated as two independent processes: one of absorption, the other of emission. The molecules absorb radiation not only at exactly the center frequency Vji but over some interval. How effectively they absorb away from the line center is described by the absorption profile <1>( v) (see section 6.3.1). This is a normalized function, [ <1>(v)dv = 1 Jline which for a Gaussian of half-width 2H has the form (13.58) (13.59) In our applications, the energy levels are rather sharp and the line broadening is due to the Doppler shift arising from the motion of the molecules (relative to their local standard of rest). In other environments, like stellar atmospheres, the levels themselves are broadened by collisional perturbations. The emission and absorption coefficient can be expressed through the Einstein coefficients A j i and B j i for spontaneous and induced emission. Following the discussion in subsection 6.3.1, a beam of light of intensity Iv, solid angle d Q and frequencies in the interval [v, d v + d v] induces, per unit length, upward transitions.

According to (13.60) and (13.63), the local line profile <t>(v) appears in the expression for the absorption and emission coefficient, K v and tv. The function <t> (v) is rarely of purely thermal origin. For example, purely thermal and optically thin molecular lines from a cold interstellar cloud of 10K would have a width of typically 0.1 km S-1 (see (5.13)), however, observed lines are usually a few times wider. Broadening is, therefore, dominated by other, non-thermal motions, their precise origin being unclear. The observed profiles are, nevertheless, usually of Gaussian shape which indicates that the motions have a random, turbulent character. In the micro turbulent approximation it is assumed that the velocity distribution of the non-thermal motions follows a Gauss curve and that the mean free photon path is much bigger than the scale length of turbulence. In the line profile (13.59), one, therefore, puts 2 (2kT 2) H = ----;;;: + ~turb In 2 where m is the molecular mass and ~turb the most likely turbulent velocity. One solves the radiative transfer equations (13.39) and (13.40) for all lines and afterwards the abundance equations (13.75) and (13.76), and repeats this sequence until convergence is reached. 135.34 The Sobolev approximation When the velocity field v in a cloud has a large gradient, the radiative energy densities in the lines, Uij, may be computed locally, without knowledge of the"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"(13.77) Line radiation 423 radiation field in other parts of the cloud [Sob60, Ryb70]. This significantly simplifies the procedure. Atoms do then not interact with one another radiatively over large distances because their emission is Doppler-shifted by comfortably more than the linewidth. The standard example is the outward flow in a stellar wind. For a radial inflow, there are, however, two interacting points along the line of sight (figure 16.8). The mean intensity J (or the radiative energy density Uij) in the case of large velocity gradients is derived from a photon escape probability f3 by assuming that J is proportional to the source function S, J = (I - (3) S. If f3 = I, photons leave unimpeded and there are no induced transitions in (13.75). If f3 = 0, photons cannot escape and J equals the source function of (13.64). To determine f3, consider a point x in a cloud. Let T be the optical depth from x towards the edge of the cloud along some axis s, with s = 0 at point x. Let f3e be the corresponding escape probability given by Here e denotes the unit vector in the direction of the s-axis. The escape probability f3e depends on the optical depth T but not on the radiation field. Because the velocity gradient is large, all relevant contributions to the optical depth T come from the immediate vicinity of point x. As there is also emission along the line for s > 0, the mean f3e is given by an average over e- r , If T is large, (f3e) = liT. If T is small, (f3e) = I, which is all reasonable. To find the effective f3, one must further average (f3e) over all directions e. For a spherical cloud of radius r, where e is the inclination angle to the radial vector and JL = cos e, we get _ III 1- e- r f3 - - dJL. 2 -1 T To evaluate this integral, one has to determine T as a function of frequency v, radius r and direction JL.

After an initial and violent phase it has settled into a quasi- stationary state where global parameters, like luminosity, spectral appearance, gas mass or supernova rate change only gradually, on a time scale of '\" I 0 10 yr. It is a flat disk about 30 kpc across and several hundred parsec thick with a global star formation rate of \"'5 M 0 per year. The center of the Milky Way harbours a huge stellar cluster, the nuclear bulge, with a diameter of order 2 kpc which contains '\" I % of the total stellar mass of the Milky Way. The flat disk is enveloped by a halo of some 200 globular clusters. The total power radiated by the Milky Way is estimated to 4 x 10 10 L 0 and has its origin in the luminosity of the stars. About two-thirds of the starlight leave the Milky Way unimpeded, one-third is absorbed by dust grains and transferred to infrared radiation (2:10 /Lm). The space between the stars is not empty but filled with gas, dust grains, relativistic particles (moving close to the speed of light), magnetic fields and photons. Together these components constitute the interstellar medium. It exists in several phases which differ in all basic parameters like temperature, density, chemical composition or radiation field. In each of them, the dust is modified by the specific environment. Usually, one classifies the interstellar medium according to the state of hydrogen, the most abundant element: 425"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"426 Diffuse matter in the Milky Way • In molecular clouds, hydrogen is mostly molecular (H2). Besides H2, one finds in them all kinds of molecules. • In the diffuse or HI gas, hydrogen is mostly atomic (H). • In HI! regions, hydrogen is ionized (H+) and forms a hot plasma. Roughly speaking, half of interstellar the mass is in molecular clouds, half in the diffuse gas, and of order I % in HI! regions. Together, the three phases account for 99% of the mass of the interstellar medium or about 5% of the stellar mass of the Milky Way. The total gas mass is M gas '\" 5 x 10 9 MG. The dust is just a small admixture. Assuming a dust-to-gas mass ratio of I: ISO, its mass in the Milky Way amounts to Mdust '\" 3 x 10 7 MG. As a result of its rotation, the Milky Way has formed a spiral pattern which can be admired in face-on external galaxies (figure 11.4). About every 10 8 yr a density wave sweeps over a parcel of gas in the Milky Way and causes a drastic change in its physical state. The dust then changes its environment leaving, for example, the warm and tenuous medium and entering a cold and dense phase. This affects the composition and structure of the grains and happens repeatedly during their lifetime. The passage of spirals wave initiates star formation. 14.1.2 The relevance of dust If there is so relatively little dust, why is it so important? There are many reasons: practical, astronomically fundamental and philosophical. Some are listed here, without aiming at completeness. Dust is so important: • because it weakens the visual light and thus limits our optical view in the Galaxy; • because it converts the radiation from stars into the infrared; in some galaxies up to 99%, in the Milky Way about 30%; • because it determines the spectral appearance of stars during their formation; in this phase, it is also essential for the dynamics of the gas; • because it strongly influences the physical and chemical conditions of the interstellar medium (thermal balance, molecular abundances, radiation field); • because it is the basis for the formation of planets; and • because man is made of interstellar dust. Although not an argument of natural sciences but of humanities, the fact that there is a lineage between us and dust is probably the ultimate reason for our interest in it. When did astronomers realize the relevance of interstellar dust? As a legendary beginning one may count the year 1784 when Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel (the father of John Frederick William) looked at the dust cloud p Ophiuchus and exclaimed: Hier ist ein Loch im Himmel (There is a hole in the sky). The scientific investigation of dust started with the Sky photography of E Barnard and M Wolf in the 1920s which revealed the existence of dark"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"Molecular clouds 427 clouds. Their concentration towards the galactic plane could explain the zone of avoidance for globular clusters and galaxies. J H Dart argued in 1932 that the absorbing particles cannot be larger than the wavelength of visible light as otherwise they would produce noticeable effects on the dynamics of stars perpendicular to the galactic plane. In 1937 J S Hall established the extinction law in the visible and in 1949 Hall and W A Hiltner discovered interstellar polarization. But the full relevance of dust for astronomy was grasped only with the advent of infrared detectors in the 1960s. The breakthrough came when it was realized that the sky was littered with bright infrared sources. In the 1980s and 1990s, satellites mapped the total sky at infrared wavelengths not accessible from the ground; the origin of the infrared emission is usually dust. 14.2 Molecular clouds Roughly half of the mass of the interstellar medium resides in molecular clouds. There, as the name suggests, one finds many molecular species and almost all hydrogen is in the form of H2. The prevalence of molecules is due to the fact that the dust shields them from destructive ultraviolet radiation. Molecular clouds block the starlight and, therefore, on photographic plates, the near ones appear as holes in the sky that is otherwise littered by myriads of stars. This has prompted their second name: dark clouds. The biggest molecular clouds have masses greater than 10 5 M 0 and are labeled giant molecular clouds (GMC). These GMCs are further structured into clumps which are the birth place of stars. The density contrast between clumps and their environment is about one order of magnitude. Molecular clouds trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way but are also found in the interarm medium. Examples of well-studied nearby molecular clouds are the complexes in Taurus (distance D = 140 pc, mass M '\" 10 4 M 0 , extension L = 20 pc), in Ophiuchus (similar parameters but containing much denser concentrations), and the Orion GMC. Although on maps in the CO line (see later) most molecular clouds have a sharp edge, the transition of the gas density to the intercloud medium is not abrupt. There is always an intermediate layer with a dust optical depth A v '\" I mag where CO is photo-dissociated. Therefore, molecular clouds are enveloped by a halo of atomic hydrogen which, by mass, is not always negligible with respect to the molecular cloud proper. It is not clear how molecular clouds are made, whether through coagulation of smaller units or by large-scale instabilities but the shocks in the spiral arms are probably an important ingredient in their creation. The likely destruction mechanism for GMCs is the internal formation of massive stars which produce strong winds and eventually supernova explosions. The average lifetime of a giant molecular cloud, TOMC, depends then, in some loose way, on the star-formation efficiency; estimates for TOMC are several 10 7 yr."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"428 Diffuse matter in the Milky Way Table 14.1.

These molecules have very diverse structures and trace, in various lines, different physical conditions. We only discuss carbon monoxide (CO) which is the most widely observed molecule in the study of galactic and extragalactic molecular clouds because it possesses a number of favourable properties: • It is very abundant. Where it exists, its number density relative to molecular hydrogen is [CO]/[H2] '\" 1 0- 4 . All other molecules are at least one order of magnitude less frequent. • It is very stable with a dissociation energy of 11.09 e V. • Its lowest rotational levels are easily populated by collisions. The level j = 1 is only 5 K above the ground state and requires for its excitation a density of only n(H2) > 100 cm 3 . • It has several observable isotopes: CO, l3CO, CISO and C l7 0 spanning three orders of magnitude in abundance and likewise in column density and optical thickness. We, therefore, exemplify the discussion of interstellar molecules by CO. 14.2.1.2 Nomenclature of levels CO possesses rotational, vibrational and electronic levels which require progressively higher energies for their excitation, Eel» Evib » E rat . • Rotational states have quantum numbers j = 0,1,2,3, ....

The standard isotopic ratio of elsa and e l7 a are 500 and 1800, respectively, so these molecules are some five and 20 times less abundant than l3eo. 14.2.3 Molecular hydrogen Molecular hydrogen, by far the most abundant molecule, is hardly excited under normal conditions of the interstellar medium and, therefore, generally inconspicuous, it just supplies the mass for the interstellar gas. However, it is well observable in photo-dissociation regions and shocks and there its emission gives information about the ultraviolet radiation field, gas temperatures and densities or shock velocities. Wherever there is high-mass star formation, with jets and copious UV radiation, rot-vib lines of H2 are seen, even in external galaxies. There are two forms of molecular hydrogen: ortho- H2 with parallel and para- H2 with opposite proton spins. When the temperature is high and many rotational levels are excited, the ortho form is three times as abundant as the para form, corresponding to the ratio of the statistical weights. Radiative transitions between ortho and para hydrogen are forbidden; however, spin exchange can occur by collisions with molecules and ions or on grain surfaces but the rates are low. The existence of the ortho and para forms is a consequence of the exclusion principle; the isotope HD, where the nuclei are not identical, does not show this property. The electronic ground state of H2 is X I 'Et (see nomenclature in section 14.2.1). The g (gerade) signifies that the the homonuclear molecule is symmetric with respect to swapping the two nuclei, whereas u (ungerade) would imply asymmetry. Being homonuclear, only quadrupole rot-vib transitions are allowed (section 1.4.4) subject to the selection rules /';.j = ±2 or 0 (excluding o --+ 0 transitions). The spacing of rotational levels is given by (14.3). The lowest excited level of para-H2 (X I 'Et v = 0 j = 2) lies 510 K above the ground (j = 0), too high to be populated at normal temperatures. The j = 2 --+ 0 emission line from this level appears at 28 !Lm and, as a quadrupole transition, has a small Einstein coefficient (A = 3 x 10- 11 S-I). The lowest ortho-line (j = 3 --+ 1, A = 4.8 x 10- 10 S-I) is at 17 !Lm and even harder to excite. 14.2.4 Formation of molecular hydrogen on dust surfaces The major destruction route of H2 in the diffuse gas, outside HI! regions, is photo-dissociation.

As the radiation penetrates into the cloud, it becomes absorbed (mainly by dust) and the UV flux weakens. This leads to the formation of a sequence of chemically distinct layers.

CO is then destroyed by line absorption (A < 1118 A) from the ground state X 1 I;+ to a bound level of a high electronic state (E, F, ... ) that couples radiationless to a dissociating state. The line absorption leads to the effect of self- shielding. For an isotope like l3CO, the dissociating lines are slightly shifted in frequency. Because the l3CO column density is much smaller, l3CO is destroyed in a larger volume than l2CO. When UV shielding is high, CO is formed by neutral-neutral reactions like CH + 0 --+ CO + H. 14.2.4.2 The early universe In the early universe, at a redshift z ;S 1000 when hydrogen was already neutral but before the appearance of the first stars, there were no heavy elements and thus no dust, only hydrogen and helium.

Although the reactions were not efficient, they led to a small fraction of molecular hydrogen which was important for the formation of the first stars. The critical mass for gravitational instability of a gas cloud depends on temperature as T 3 / 2 (see (15.48)) and contraction is possible only if the release of potential energy can be radiated away. Here molecular hydrogen could have acted as a coolant down to 100 K by emission of its lowest rotational lines. 14.3 Clouds of atomic hydrogen 14.3.1 General properties of the diffuse gas About half of the mass of the interstellar medium is in diffuse clouds. They contain only a few molecular species. As hydrogen is mainly atomic there, this component is called a HI gas. Its properties, to a large degree, are derived from observations of the famous 21 cm line but also from Ha and atomic fine structure lines, infrared dust emission and pulsar dispersion. Although the HI gas is very inhomogeneous, it is useful to define a standard HI cloud with parameters as in table 14.2. Such clouds are seen in absorption and emission and make up what is called the cold neutral medium (CNM) of the diffuse gas because the hydrogen there is mostly neutral and relatively cold. The scale height of the clouds at the locus of the Sun is about 250 pc, which is a few times bigger than for CO and increases outside the solar circle. There are other components which are less dense and completely penetrated by UV radiation. They are, therefore, more strongly ionized and much warmer. In the warm ionized medium (WIM), n = 0.1 ... 1 cm- 3 and gas temperatures are several thousand K. This component is only seen in emission, it is much more voluminous, has a larger scale height and a very low optical depth in the 21 cm line, T < 0.01. There also exists some hot ionized medium (HIM) with"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Clouds of atomic hydrogen 439 T gas '\" 10 5 ... 10 6 K. It is, of course, very tenuous (n = 0.01 cm- 3 ) and detected either by soft X-ray emission or through UV absorption lines of highly excited ions (for instance, 0 VI at 1030 A) towards hot stars. It occupies a lot of space, probably most of the galactic disk but its mass fraction is negligible. 14.3.2 The 21 em line of atomic hydrogen In its electronic ground state, a hydrogen atom has two hyperfine sublevels because the spin of the electron couples to the spin of the proton. There is level splitting for the same reason as in the Zeeman effect, only here the magnetic field is supplied by the nuclear magnetic dipole. Let F denote the quantum number of total angular momentum which is the sum of electron spin S and nuclear spin I, F = S + I. In the upper state, electron and proton spin are parallel, F = 1 and the statistical weight is gl = 3; it is a triplet. In the lower state, the spins are anti-parallel, F = 0 and gO = 1; it is a singlet. The transition from an upper to the lower level occurs at v = 1420 MHz or A = 21.11 cm and one, therefore, speaks of the 21 cm line. As its propagation is not impeded by dust, in the 1950s it played a dominant role in elucidating the structure of the interstellar medium of the Milky Way. Indeed, most of what we know about the diffuse component, its temperature, density, kinematic behavior, total mass and overall distribution, is due to the study of the 21 cm line. 14.32.1 Frequency and transition probability of the line One obtains an estimate of the energy difference /';.E between triplet and singlet from the classical formula (11.16) which gives the potential energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field. The dipole moment of the proton is given by {tp = 2.793 . {tN and is thus 2.793 times greater than a nuclearmagneton {tN (compare with (11.10) for the Bohr magneton), en {tN = --. 2m p c The magnetic field in which the proton aligns is supplied by the electron. It is a dipole field (see the electric analog in (3.10)) of moment {tB and decays with distance like r- 3 . When one evaluates its strength at one Bohr radius ao = 5.29 x 10- 9 cm, (11.16) yields a frequency v = /';.E / h ::::: 530 MHz. This is the right order of magnitude but an underestimate because ao is the mean distance and the positions where the electron is closer to the nucleus have a higher weight. A very good number is obtained when one averages over the radius and takes the"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"440 Diffuse matter in the Milky Way 1s wave function as the weight. Quantum mechanically, the frequency has been determined to extremely high precision, it is a number with 11 significant digits. The Einstein A-coefficient of the line follows from the general formula (6.41) but this time !L is a magnetic dipole moment given by the sum !Lp + !LB. The value of AIO comes out very small (A 10 = 2.869 x 10- 15 S-I): first, because it is not an electric but a magnetic dipole transition which reduces AIO by a factor '\"'-'10 6 ; and second, because the frequency is low (A ex: v 3 after (6.41)). The excited state has an extremely long lifetime, T = 1/ A '\"'-' 10 7 yr, compared to optical transitions where T '\"'-' 10- 8 s. Nevertheless, there is enough neutral hydrogen around to make the line easily observable. 14.3.3 How the hyperfine levels of atomic hydrogen are excited 14.331 The excitation or spin temperature In determining the population of the hyperfine levels, we include, for generality, a radiation field U v . It may come, for example, from a supernova remnant or the 3 K microwave background. The atomic levels change because of collisions as well as spontaneous and radiatively induced transitions. As there are only two levels involved, 0 and 1, we have, in standard notation, (14.8) The left-hand side populates state 0, the right-hand side depopulates it. Here n = n 1 + no is the total number of hydrogen atoms per cm 3 and C 10 is the collision rate for de-excitation (F = 1 --+ 0).

The statistical weights gi are gone. For the 21 cm line, the exponents a and ax are much smaller than one.

Then the levels are thermalized (T x ::::: T) above the critical density: -I AIO kT ncr=y =-- CIO hv One often uses for the critical density the expression ncr '\" A 10/ COl. We did so, for example, in estimating ncr for the CO rotational levels in section 14.2.1. Indeed, when there are only two levels and no radiation, equation (14.9) implies T x '\" T when n = AIO/COI, provided that a 2::. 1. However, at very low frequencies (h v « kT), thermalization requires a density that is kT / h v times larger. Because the temperature difference between the levels of the 21 cm line is only h v / k = 0.068 K and the gas temperature T '\" 100 K, the usual formula ncr ::::: A 10 / Co I is wrong by a factor'\" 1000. The cross section for collisional deexcitation (F = 1 --+ 0) in a gas of 100 K is 0'10 '\" 10- 15 cm 2 , corresponding to a collision rate CIO = (uO'IO) '\" 2 x 10- 10 cm 3 S-I. The brackets denote an average over the Maxwellian velocity distribution and u is the velocity. In a standard HI cloud, which has T = 100 K and n 2::. 1 cm- 3 , the sublevels are, in view of the small Einstein coefficient, thermalized, so the population ratio nl ::::: 3 no and the total hydrogen density n is close to 4no. However, in a tenuous and hot cloud (n = 0.05 cm- 3 , and T = 1000 K implying y ::::: 7 in equation (14.10)), there is, rather surprisingly, a substantial excursion of the hyperfine levels from LTE and the ratio T x / T is only one-quarter. 14.333 Spin exchange by collisions among H atoms The physical process that determines the cross section, 0'10, is spin exchange. Suppose a hydrogen atom labeled (1) with F = 1 and electron spin up is hit by another hydrogen atom. In the collision, the electron spin of atom (1) can flip so that afterwards it is in the state F = 0; the proton of atom (1) is shielded by the electron cloud and its spin is unaffected. The electron spin of the hitting atom"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"442 Diffuse matter in the Milky Way is random and thus some linear combination of up and down; its proton spin is irrelevant. During the impact, the two atoms form a molecular complex. If the electron spin of the hitting atom is also up, the complex is in the repulsive electronic triplet state eb, potential V t ); if it is down, the complex is in the attractive electronic singlet state e b, potential V s ), as in stable H2 molecules. At large separations, the two potentials are equal. In quantum mechanics, it is not possible to specify the state of the atoms separately. Instead, the wave function of the complex is written as a sum of a symmetric and an anti-symmetric function with respect to the interchanging particles. The symmetric part is associated with the phase factor exp( -i Vtt (It), because when the electrons are swapped, the wavefunction stays the same, the anti-symmetric part is associated with the phase factor exp( -i Vst In). So in a time interval dt, the phase between triplet and singlet changes by (V t - Vs)dtln. Therefore the atoms exchange electron spins at a rate (V t - V s ) In. As the potentials V t and V s are known, one can semi- classically follow the collision over the time of the impact and thus calculate the probability that afterwards atom (l) is in state F = 0 [Pur56]. This yields 0'10. Because the interaction potential is steep, 0'10 changes only weakly with temperature (<x T- 1 j4). 14.334 Excitation by electrons and L a radiation Spin flip is also possible as a result of collisions with free electrons. Here the cross sections are about half as large but electrons fly faster, so the collision rates are higher. Electron impact becomes important when the fractional ionization of hydrogen exceeds a few percent. In principle, spin flip can also occur due to the interaction between the magnetic moments of the electrons but this process is several orders of magnitude weaker. Another interesting way of exciting the hyperfine levels of hydrogen atoms is through La photons [Wou52]. They connect the n = I and n = 2 states and are created in HI clouds by cosmic-ray ionization and subsequent proton-electron recombination. The state n = 2 consists of three sublevels, each being double because of the hyperfine splitting. The 2S1j2 and 2Plj2 states, which coincide in Dirac theory, are actually separate due to the Lamb shift. Only the 2P levels are allowed to combine with the ground state ISlj2. As a resonance line, the La optical depth is immense and each La photon is scattered many times, i.e. undergoes many collisions with H atoms at the gas kinetic temperature T. The radiation field in the La line therefore acquires the same shape (spectral slope) as the Planck function at that temperature. Because in the absence of collisions and radiatively induced transitions, the population of the hyperfine levels is determined by the La radiation field, the spin temperature T x is also forced towards the kinetic gas temperature T."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"Clouds of atomic hydrogen 443 14.3.4 Gas density and temperature from the 21 em line 14.34.1 Optical depth and column density The optical depth element in the HI line is, from (13.62), dT v = K<t>(v) ds where <t> (v) is the normalized profile function and the absorption coefficient K is from formula (13.68). Because hv « kT x , one can expand the e-function in (13.68) and obtain hv K ::::: noKo-. kT x Here no is the number of atoms in the lower singlet state and Ko is after (13.67) proportional to the Einstein coefficient AIO. The factor hv/kT x is due to stimulated emission. Without it, one would have K ::::: noKo. So stimulated emission, which is usually negligible at optical wavelengths, reduces the cross section in the 21 cm line by a factor of order 103(!) at typical excitation temperatures T x '\" 100 K.

But note that the intensity of optically thin line emission, which is proportional to Tv T x , is independent of temperature. It is often convenient to refer the profile function to the Doppler velocity v, and not to the frequency v. It is then denoted by P (v), again with f P (v) d v = 1. At the line center, v = O.

(14.15) 14.34.2 How to measure the optical depth and the spin temperature With the help of a strong background source, say, a quasar, one can determine the optical depth Tv as well as the spin temperature T x of an HI cloud. First, one performs a measurement towards the quasar at a frequency outside the line where the HI cloud is transparent (Tv = 0). This provides the brightness To of the quasar after (14.13). Then one observes the quasar at various velocities in the line. The actual frequency changes are very small, so To is practically constant. If the quasar is much brighter than the foreground HI gas, it will be seen in absorption and equation (14.13) reduces to This gives Tv. One can now evaluate the column density N(HI) after (14.14); the optical thickness need not be small. In the line core, at a position immediately adjacent to the quasar, Tb = T x (1 - e- rV ). As Tv is known, such a measurement yields the spin temperature T x . Of course, one has to assume that T x is constant along the line of sight and that the cloud parameters do not change as one switches from the quasar to a nearby off-position. 14.3.5 The deuterium hyperfine line Deuterium, the hydrogen isotope, also shows hyperfine splitting in its electronic ground state. The importance of this line rests in the fact that it could improve the estimate of the deuterium abundance of the interstellar medium, with cosmological consequences because deuterium has been created during the Big Bang. So far all attempts to detect the transition have failed because the isotope is so rare ([D]/[H] '\" 10- 5 ). In deuteron, the spins of proton and neutron are parallel. So the nuclear spin quantum number I of deuterium equals 1 and the spin flip of the electron corresponds to an F = 3/2 --+ 1/2 transition. The magnetic moment of the neutron is {tn = -1.913 {tN"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"Clouds of atomic hydrogen 445 and directed opposite to the magnetic moment of the proton. The magnetic moment of deuteron is quite close to the sum of the two, {tD ::::: {tn + {tp ::::: 0.857 {tN· When one aims at greater precision for {tD, one must take into account that the deuteron nucleus possesses some orbital angular momentum (quantum number I). This is witnessed by its electric quadrupole moment, which also gives rise to a magnetic dipole moment. In its ground state, deuteron is a mixture consisting to \"'95% of an S (I = 0) wavefunction and to \"'5% of a D (I = 2) wavefunction. To find the frequency of the deuterium hyperfine line relative to the hydrogen 21 cm line, we cannot simply scale with the ratio {t D / {tp. Instead, we have to translate the classical formula (11.16) for the potential energy of a magnetic dipole m in an outer field into an interaction operator W according to the rules of quantum mechanics. But for a constant factor, we can write mnue = gnuel for the nucleus and mel = gelS for the electron, where g is the Lande factor, so For deuterium, ID = 1 and gD = 0.857; for hydrogen, IH = ~ and gH = 2· 2.793, for the electron S = ~ and gel = 2.

This is in the inner parts of HI! regions where hydrogen is ionized too.

Its La radiation from the singlet system of para-helium at A = 584 A is also able to ionize hydrogen. Because helium ionization requires more energetic photons (x(He) = 24.6eV > X (H) = 13.6eV), the Hell region is never greater than the Hll region, at best co-extensive. If NL,He is the number of Lye photons with h v > X (He), the Stromgren radius rs (He) for helium becomes [ 3N ] 1/3 (H ) L,He rS e = 47Tnen(He+)a(2J(He) (14.38) The flux NL,He depends sensitively on the stellar effective temperature: For BO stars, the Hell zone is practically absent, for stars of spectral type 06 or earlier, rs(He) = rs(H). 14.4.3 Dusty HII regions 14.4.31 Ionization balance of a dusty HI! regions The presence of dust reduces the number of Lye photons available for ionization of the gas and, therefore, the size of an Hll region. Let r be the optical depth in the Lyman continuum with respect to dust only, and Kd the corresponding dust cross section per H atom. So dr = n Kd dr, where n = ne + nH and helium has been negelected.

One finds r dS by putting (14.40) to zero and solving for To This yields the optical thickness cdS = rdsnK of a dusty HI! region and thus rdS. For example, a region with optical depth cdS = I has a 56% smaller volume than one without dust where cdS = O. There are no observations of the extinction curve in the Lyman continuum, the dust cross section Kd is, therefore, quite uncertain for A < 912 A. Of course, we have some guidance from the dielectric permeability s of figure 7.19. According to it, when applying Mie theory, the cross section of an individual grain is at A = 1000 A three times greater than in the visual and continues to rise towards shorter wavelengths up to a resonance at \"'700 A. For a compact HI! region (n = 10 4 cm- 3 ) around an 06 star (NL = 10 49 S-I) the dust-free Stromgren radius rs = 4.5 x 10 17 cm. If the dust in the HI! region had the same abundance and properties as in the diffuse interstellar medium, its cross section per hydrogen atom at 1000 A would be Kd ::::: 1.5 x 10- 21 cm 2 , and in the Lyman continuum greater still. This would imply a huge optical depth (c = rn K d '\" 10) so that the HI! region would almost vanish. However, compact HI! regions are being observed. Consequently, the dust must be modified, most likely it is depleted, partially destroyed by the strong and hard far UV field. In HI! regions, dust absorption coefficients per gram of interstellar matter are probably reduced by a factor of four with respect to neutral gas clouds. The dust in an HI! region is heated radiatively and its temperature Td is decoupled from the gas temperature. The radiation field Iv which the grains absorb includes stellar light, La photons and optical cooling lines. Td then follows from (8.7). In a compact HI! region, more than two-thirds of the radiation is emitted by dust (disregarding the surrounding shell of neutral gas). 14.4.32 Ly a photons of hydrogen Each Lyman continuum photon ionizing a hydrogen atom leads inevitably to a proton-electron recombination. No matter how the newly formed hydrogen atom cascades down from its excited state, eventually it produces a Lya photon of energy hV a = 10.2 eY. Like all photons connecting to the ground state, they are trapped inside the HI! region. Therefore their radiation density is very high. But it cannot build up indefinitely because of the following three destruction routes: • Absorption of Lya photons on grains. This is by far the most important process and works independently of the amount of dust in the HI! region. If there is very little dust because most has been destroyed, the few remaining grains receive all the Lya flux and will be very hot. They absorb the fraction NLhv a / L* of the stellar luminosity L*, typically 25%. This energy then escapes as infrared radiation. If the HI! region is not almost dust-free and the dust optical depth cdS not small, the infrared luminosity (without cooling"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"(14.41) 47T f tv dv Hll regions 455 fine structure lines) will be even greater than \"'25%. In addition, the grains then also directly absorb stellar photons of all wavelengths, as well as diffuse photons of the cooling lines. • Decay of the metastable upper level 2 2S (n = 2, I = 0, lifetime 0.12 s) into the ground state I 2S by emission of two photons (see end of section 6.3.4.3) of total energy hv a . Averaged over many transitions, the decay forms a continuum. • Diffusion of La photons into the optically thin line wings from where they can escape the HI! region. 14.4.4 Bremsstrahlung In a hydrogen plasma of temperature T and electron density ne, the electrons have a mean velocity proportional to T 1 /2. The protons are much heavier and, therefore, almost at rest. As an electron passes a proton, it is accelerated and changes its direction, usually only a little. The acceleration of the electron leads after the dipole formula (1.97) to electromagnetic radiation. • The monochromatic emission coefficient is (without proof) _ ~j27Tme ~ 2 -hvlkT tv - 2 3 gff n e e . 3 3kT mec The emission spectrum is at low frequencies flat, tv ::::: 5.44 x 1O-39n~T-1/2 erg cm- 3 s- I Hz- I steC I because exp( -h v / kT) ::::: I and the Gaunt factor gff ::::: 1.

With the help of table 14.3 or equation (14.22), one can predict from (14.46) the radio flux Sv that a star of certain stellar type or mass will produce. Because the dust emission drops with frequency like v 4 , whereas the radio spectrum is flat, bremsstrahlung exceeds dust emission at long long wavelengths. The cross-over is usually at A '\" 3 mm. 14.4.5 Recombination lines Important information on HI! regions is provided by recombination lines. They arise when electrons recombine with protons, or other ions, and cascade downwards. For hydrogen-like atoms, the frequencies follow from the Rydberg formula (n > m) v = cRZ2 (_1 _~). m 2 n 2 Z is the electric charge of the atomic nucleus (Z = 1 for H) and R the Rydberg constant (for infinite nuclear mass, R = 109737.3 cm- I ). Transitions"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"Mass estimates of interstellar clouds 457 n --+ n - 1 are called a-lines, n --+ n - 2 are ,B-lines, and so forth. Because the recombination and Einstein coefficients are known, the strength of the lines yields directly the number of ionizing photons in an HI! region. Optical lines (Balmer lines, like Ha) can be very bright but in order to be interpreted they have to be corrected for dust extinction. De-reddening by means of an extinction curve (figure 7.8) requires observations of several lines at different wavelengths. The procedure is often ambiguous because one does not know how much dust resides within the HI! region and how much is in the foreground. The problem is less severe in the near infrared (Brackett and higher- order lines). Interstellar dust extinction is irrelevant for transitions between high quantum states. Such radio recombination lines can be detected from very obscured and optically not accessible places. When combining the radial velocity with the rotation curve of the Milky Way, one obtains the (kinematic) distance of the source. The lines thus reveal the spiral structure of the Milky Way as traced by bright star-forming regions. We add three other interesting features of radio recombination lines: • As the Einstein coefficients are small, the levels have a long lifetime and they are reshuffled by collisions leading to a population that is close to thermodynamic equilibrium, at the temperature of the ionized gas (see (5.40)). • Because electrons with high quantum numbers are far from the atomic nucleus, nuclei of the same charge but of different mass produce only slightly shifted frequencies. For example, the relative difference /';. v / v between H und He radio recombination lines is 4.1 x 10- 4 which allows us to observe both lines in one measurement, thus enhancing the accuracy of line and abundance ratios. • The highest transitions observed are around n '\" 700. The atomic radius r increases with quantum number like r = aon 2 (Bohr radius ao = 0.529 A) and such highly excited atoms have macroscopic sizes (> 1 /Lm). 14.5 Mass estimates of interstellar clouds The amount of interstellar gas, M gas , that an astronomical object contains, be it a galaxy, a molecular cloud or a stellar disk, is one of its prime parameters, like luminosity or size. We summarize a few methods for estimating M gas . None of them is very precise, so one employs as many methods as possible and takes an average. 14.5.1 From optically thin CO lines Consider rotational CO transitions j + 1 --+ } m a homogeneous cloud of temperature T and column density Nj of molecules in level j. If <t> (v) is the"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"458 Diffuse matter in the Milky Way Gaussian line profile from (13.59), the optical thickness Tv becomes (14.47) where b j = Nj / N; denotes the deviation of Nj from the LTE value N; (see (13.69)). Let ~ v = 2H be the half-width in frequency of the absorption profile and T c the optical depth in the line center. One then finds that in LTE (b j = b j + I = 1), the column density of the upper level is given by JL is the dipole moment of the molecule and ~ v = c ~ v / v. The optical depth in the center of millimeter CO lines is always high (T c » 1) but for the isotope CISO, T c is often below one. Then ~ v is also the observed linewidth and T c follows from the line temperature h = T c T. If ~ v is given in cm S-I N 6 81 10 9 h ~v 2j + 3 cm-2. HI = . x T ehvjkT _ 1 j + 1 The column density of the upper level, NH I, is roughly proportional to the line area h~ v. It depends only weakly on the kinetic gas temperature T and can be converted into the total CO column density N(CO) with the help of the Boltzmann distribution (5.8) and from there to the molecular hydrogen column density, N(H2), assuming the standard ratio [H2]/[CO] = 10 4 . 14.5.2 From the CO luminosity Most molecular clouds do not collapse under their own gravity but seem to be virialized. Their typical internal systematic velocity ~ v is then determined by the cloud mass M (section 15.2.1). If R denotes the cloud radius, The CO luminosity is defined by Leo = Abeam [ Tmb(V) dv Jline (14.48) where Abeam is the area of the beam at the distance of the source and T mb is the observed main-beam-brightness temperature (section 13.1.4) of a CO rotational line, usually the (1-0) or (2-1) transition. It is customary to measure Leo in pc 2 K km S-I. The integral in (14.48) extends over the whole line. As long as the source is smaller than the beam, the product Abeam T mb and thus Leo is constant,"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"(14.49) Mass estimates of interstellar clouds 459 independent of the beam size. If the mass fraction of stars within the cloud is negligible such that M ::::: M gas , then T Leo ex: -JiiM gas where T is the cloud temperature and n the number density of the gas. If one assumes that the ratio T / -Jii is constant for all clouds, the CO luminosity is directly proportional to the cloud mass, although the CO line may be optically very thick. Of course, the relation (14.49) must be calibrated. The assumed constancy of T / -Jii implies that the gas temperature goes up when a cloud becomes more compact. By and large, this may be so, possibly as a result of increased star formation in dense regions but it is certainly not a rule. Nevertheless, the method seems to work, at least, better than we understand. The CO luminosity is also used to derive gas masses of galaxies. Gas motions there are large, of order 200 km S-1 , comparable to the rotational velocity of the Milky Way. The gas kinematics are entirely determined by the gravitational potential of the stars, and not by the gas. Nevertheless, equation (14.49) is applicable. When one makes an observation towards the center of a galaxy, the CO line will have a width of the same order, say, 200 km S-I. As the beam usually covers a linear scale of a few hundred pc or more, at the distance of the galaxy, it samples many giant molecular clouds. Each GMC produces a relatively narrow line, say, of 10 km S-1 width. The observed line is then a superposition of many sublines that are well separated, either spatially because they come from different locations in the galaxy or in frequency space because they have different Doppler velocities. The contributions from the GMCs thus add up linearly to give the total gas mass of the galaxy. In the CO (2-1) line, for example, an average over a large sample of spiral galaxies yields Leo '\" 4M gas when M gas is measured in M 0 and Leo in pc 2 K km S-I. Of course, the masses from the CO luminosity refer only to the molecular gas. How to estimate column densities of the HI gas was discussed in section 14.3.4. Masses from dust emission (see later) include both components, HI andH2. 14.5.3 From dust emission Because the dust absorption coefficient K A drops quickly with wavelength (figure 12.10), almost all interstellar clouds are transparent in the submillimeter and millimeter region. The observed flux SA from the dust is then directly proportional to the dust mass Md. If the dust temperature Td is uniform over the source, KABA(Td)Md SA = D2 (14.50) The distance D is usually known, Td has to be derived as a color temperature from the fluxes at, at least, two wavelengths (see (8.20) and discussion thereafter)"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"460 Diffuse matter in the Milky Way or from molecular line data.

In section 15.2, we delineate the structure of cloud clumps at the verge of gravitational instability and present Jeans's criterion for collapse to actually occur. In section 15.3, we numerically analyse the equations for spherical, isothermal collapse and derive, for the earliest stages of protostellar evolution, the approximate density and velocity structure of the protostellar clump.

They are, by and large, the ultimate source of luminosity in galaxies. The energy is generated in the stellar cores by fusion of atomic nuclei. During the main-sequence phase, hydrogen is burnt into helium. In the post-main-sequence phase, when hydrogen has been exhausted, elements of atomic mass number greater than four are produced by compounding helium nuclei. The energy yield per gram of matter is then one order of magnitude smaller. Fusion ends with the generation of iron which has the lowest binding energy per nucleon; heavier nuclei release energy not in fusion but in fission. An example is uranium 235U where fission, here on Earth, has very diverse technical applications: to supply electricity to our homes, or to remove 10000 homes in one blow. 461"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"462 Stars and their formation Table 15.1.

They are synthesized during the major burning phases and that qualitatively explains why they are so common. Estimates of their abundances are summarized in table 15.1, the burning phases are described later. Nuclear astrophysics is the branch where the synthesis of elements is studied. According to standard cosmological theories, none of the atoms heavier than helium can have been created in the Big Bang in any relevant amount. So they were made afterwards. But obviously, not all elements can have been synthesized by a-particles in nuclear burning. Nor does adding a proton to a helium core and then another and another usually work in building up heavier nuclei. For example, helium has more binding energy per nucleon than its heavier neighbors in the Periodic Table: lithium, beryllium and boron. So the latter three cannot be fused in this way. Instead, the light elements are probably made in cosmic-ray spallations. Most other elements (besides C, N, 0, Ne, Mg, Si) and the plethora of isotopes are built by neutron capture. Neutrons are made in various side-branch reactions. They do not feel the Coulomb repulsion and easily penetrate an atomic nucleus. The resulting new atom can be a stable isotope or be unstable to ,B-decay. • When the rate of neutron production and capture is slow compared to ,B-decay, as during the quiescent post-main-sequence burning stages, one speaks of s-processes. • When it is rapid, as in supernova explosions and some late stellar phases,"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"Stars on and beyond the main sequence 463 more than one neutron is captured before the nulceus ,B-decays.

A helium nucleus (mass m He 2+) is a bit lighter than four protons. The mass difference /';.m = m He 2+ - 4mp is such that /';.ml4mp = 7.12 x 10- 3 . In other words, \"'0.7% of the mass is converted into energy. The fusion of one helium nucleus thus liberates /';.mc 2 = 4.282 x 10- 5 erg = 26.73 MeV. (15.3) From burning 1 g of hydrogen into helium one receives 6.40 x 10 18 erg and this provides the greatest energy reservoir of a star, excluding gravitational collapse into a black hole. The 26.73 MeV released in reaction (15.3) appear in the form of y-rays, neutrinos, positrons and as the kinetic energy of the reaction products. The neutrinos have an extremely small cross section and escape from the burning core without interacting with the stellar material. The energy of 0.263 MeV per fused He nucleus they carry away is lost. The positrons unite with electrons and are annihilated producing y-rays. All y-photons collide with other particles and deposit their energy in the form of heat. 15.1.32 The proton-proton chain In all low-mass stars, up to masses a little more than 1 M G , helium is created in the proton-proton or pp chain. Because this process is at work in the Sun, we discuss a few details. The chain consists of three major steps: In the first step, deuterium is generated according to (15.4) The 1.442 MeV include the annihilation energy of the positron e+ and the energy of the electron-neutrino V e . Usually the Coulomb force prevents protons from coming close together but at very short distances the strong nuclear force sets in and overcomes electric repulsion. The strong force has a range of order '\" 10- 13 cm, it binds the nucleons but is not felt outside the nucleus. The strong force is insensitive to the electric charge of the nucleons, so it does not discern between protons and neutrons. The potential barrier between two protons separated by a distance r = 10- 13 cm is Eb = e 2 1r '\" 1.5 MeV. In the Sun, which has a central temperature of 1.5 x 10 7 K, the average kinetic energy of atoms is only 2 keV or a thousand times smaller.

The only way protons can unite is by tunneling through the Coulomb potential barrier. We can estimate the tunneling probability Ptun(v) for protons of velocity v from (6.57), although this formula applies strictly only to square potentials in one dimension. The distance L at which tunneling sets in follows from ~mpv2 = e 2 / L. The penetration probability, P pen , is given by As the protons get faster, Ptun(v) increases, while PMaxw(v) decreases. When we evaluate the velocity where P pen (v) has its maximum, using calculus, we find that tunneling already occurs at a distance L '\" 5 x 10- 12 cm, far beyond the range of the strong force. After the tunneling, there is an ephemeral pp complex but it is not stable: 2He does not exist. The reason is that the potential of the strong force depends on the spin direction. When the spins of the two nucleons are anti-parallel, the system is unbound, when they are parallel, the complex is bound, however, this state is excluded because the two protons are identical and as fermions their quantum numbers must not coincide. It is, therefore, not enough to have the two protons approach each other via tunneling to a nuclear distance. One of the protons must also be converted into a neutron (see reaction (15.4)). Only then does one have a stable system, a deuteron, with a binding energy of 2.23 MeV. Because a proton consists of two up and one down quark, a neutron of one up and two down quarks, there is a transformation p = (up, up, down) ---+ n = (up, down, down). It is mediated by the weak nuclear force which has an extremely short range ('\" 10- 15 cm) and is 10 12 times weaker than the electromagnetic force. Because the conversion of a proton into a neutron must take place in the short time while the proton traverses a distance of \"'10- 13 cm, the reaction (15.4) proceeds very slowly. A proton in the Sun has to wait'\" I 0 10 yr before it is incorporated into a deuterium atom. The next step, (15.5) follows only seconds later. It is so much faster because it requires only the electromagnetic and not the weak force. The appearance of a y-quantum is necessary for the conservation of energy and momentum. The photon energy is accounted for in the 5.493 MeV. In the final step the build-up is completed by (15.6)"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"Stars on and beyond the main sequence 467 For this reaction to proceed, the preceding two must have occurred twice. The 3He nuclei are doubly charged, so the Coulomb repulsion is strong and as they are also rare, the reaction is fairly slow with a time scale of order 10 6 yr. In the sun there are other channels besides (15.6) involving the elements Li, Be, B but they are far less common. The seemingly simple reaction 3He + p --+ 4He is irrelevant because it involves the weak force. 15.1.33 The eND cycle In all massive stars, there is an alternative mode of hydrogen burning: the CNO cycle. It may be started by adding a proton to a 12C atom, and then another and another. In this way, one builds up nuclei of subsequently higher mass number but eventually ends up again with a 12C atom plus an a-particle, symbolically The letter p above an arrow indicates proton capture, f3 stands for f3-decay. The elements C, Nand 0 that give the burning its name take part in the reactions only as catalysts: in equilibrium, their abundance does not change. The net result of the reaction chain is again the conversion of hydrogen into helium. The CNO cycle requires higher temperatures than the pp cycle because the Coulomb barriers are higher. It is also more sensitive to temperature: the energy production rate is at 18 x 10 6 K roughly proportional to TIS versus T 4 in the pp chain. The CNO cycle dominates when the central stellar temperature is higer than'\" 18 million K or, equivalently, when the stellar mass is slightly above I MG. The f3-decay reactions in (15.7) proceed quickly (102...3 s), on about the same time scale that a free neutron disintegrates into a proton, electron and anti- neutrino. The proton captures, however, are much slower, by far the slowest step being the formation of 15 0 from 14 N which takes about 300 million years. Therefore, even if ones starts out with no nitrogen at all, 14N will build up until an equilibrium abundance is reached. Indeed, the CNO cycle is the major source for nitrogen in the universe. Of course, the cycle can only operate if initially one of the catalysts is present. 15.1.4 The 3« process The next element, after helium, synthesized in stars by burning is carbon. It is made in red giants by fusing three a-particles. Because of the strong Coulomb repulsion between a-particles, the temperatures have to be above lOs K. The burning process consists of two steps. First, two a-particles unite to sBe, then another a-particle is added to transform beryllium into carbon.

This follows from the Saha formula when one makes some obvious modifications in (5.38). The small fraction of beryllium nuclei reacts further to form carbon, sBe + a ---+ 12 C + y + 7.37 MeV. Now it is important that carbon possesses an excited state, C*, which lies E* = 7.65 MeV above the ground level but only ER = 0.288 Me above the complex sBe + a (figure 15.2). For those atoms whose kinetic energy is close to ER, the cross section for creating C* has a sharp maximum (resonant reaction). Once formed, C* may then de-excite to the ground state 12C (a-decay is, however, more frequent). The existence of the state C* speeds up the reaction sBe + a --+ 12C by a factor 10 7 . It allows the triple-a process to operate already at a temperature of 1.2 x lOS K. Without this, the stellar interior would have to be as hot as 2 x lOS K for helium to burn into carbon. This makes a tremendous difference considering the extreme temperature sensitivity of the 3a process. At '\" lOs K, the energy production rate is proportional to T 30 , and a temperature rise of only 5% makes the reaction ten times faster. The energy yield in the 3a process per gram of matter is ten times lower than in hydrogen burning."},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"Stars on and beyond the main sequence 469 Once carbon is present, oxygen, neon, magnesium and so forth can be generated through the capture of a-particles.

When taken per gram of stellar matter, the yield decreases as heavier elements are synthesized. 15.1.5 Lifetime and luminosity of stars Stars are born with masses, m, between 0.08 and 100 M G , the upper limit being rather uncertain. Their lifetime T and luminosity L determine, to a large degree, the stellar population and the optical and infrared appearance of the Milky Way. To first order, m T <X -. L The stellar mass fixes the amount of fuel, and the luminosity the speed of its consumption. For example, assuming that 20% of the mass of the Sun is in its hydrogen burning core and that the energy yield is 0.007c 2 erg per gram of burnt matter (see (15.3)), one gets a lifetime of 20 billion years, not bad as a first estimate. Most of this time, a star spends on or near the main sequence. The subsequent evolution is very quick: first, because the star has become a giant and is generally much more luminous, so the consumption rate is higher; and second, because 90% of the fuel reserve has already been used up. Therefore, the total lifetime is not much longer than the main sequence lifetime, T ms . However, because giants are so bright, the luminosity averaged over the total lifetime of a star, L av , can be several times greater than the main sequence luminosity L ms , despite the fact that the post-main-sequence phase is short. Stars are best classified by their line spectrum. The analysis yields the spectral type (0, B, A, F, G, K, M) or effective temperature Teff, and the luminosity class (roman numbers from I to VI) or surface gravity. The stellar mass m is not an observational quantity and much less certain. It can be directly determined only in binary systems. Formulae (15.9)-(15.13) and figure 15.1 are approximations of the parameters T ms , L ms and L av , as a function of the stellar mass m.

An outstanding example is the very compact cluster in Orion around the Trapezium which contains over 2000 members with a stellar density of more than 10 4 pc- 3 .

One way to derive the IMF observationally is to count the number of stars in the solar neighborhood per interval of apparent visual magnitude mv. Then one determines their distances to obtain the luminosity function ¢(Mv). It gives the number of stars per unit volume and interval of absolute visual magnitude. When one restricts the counting to main sequence stars, Mv can be uniquely translated into a stellar mass m (see figure 15.3). This leads to a function 1jJ(m) such that 1jJ(m)dm is the present stellar density for the mass interval m ... m + dm. One arrives at the initial mass function ~(m) by deconvolving 1jJ(m) with the stellar lifetime r(m) (see again figure 15.3) and assuming that the star-formation rate has been constant over the past. A much more direct approach to find ~ (m) is to count in a young stellar cluster, where no member has yet evolved off the main sequence, the number of stars per mass interval. Such a method is, however, prone to observational bias by the detection limit as young clusters are always heavily obscured by dust. Also, the result from anyone cluster is not representative for the Milky Way as a whole. One may alternatively try to determine ~(m) theoretically by making certain assumptions about the processes during star birth.

General solutions of poly tropes are discussed in [Cha39]. Here we are interested in the structure and stability of an isothermal sphere which is described by a poly trope of index n = 00. The assumption of isothermality correctly reflects the conditions in protostellar clouds before they collapse. Heating of such a cloud, beneath its surface layer, happens either through absorption of far infrared radiation by grains or by interaction of cosmic rays with the gas. In either case, the heating rate per gram of interstellar matter is fairly uniform over the cloud and does not depend on density. Cooling comes mainly from grains (although some is due to molecular lines, especially of H20 and CO). As the cloud temperatures are low, the maximum dust emission lies at submillimeter wavelengths and such photons can freely escape. At the prevailing high densities, dust and gas are thermally coupled by collisions between gas molecules and grains. When the cloud collapses, the PdV work of the gravitational compression is transferred from the gas to the dust and radiated away. As long as the cloud is optically thin to dust radiation, which is true during the early protostellar phases, the collapse does not enhance the temperature. 15.2.3 Structure and stability of Ebert-Bonnor spheres Equations (15.22) and (15.23) are integrated from the center outwards.

Gm r=-- r 2 (15.39) together with the conditions that, at time t = 0, the cloud is at rest, f(m, 0) = O. When ro == r(m,O) and PO denotes the initial constant density, then obviously 47TPor8/3 = m.

It is completed when the cloud has contracted to a point, i.e. when r = O. This happens for fJ = 7T 12, from which follows the free-fall time ~ tff=Y~· (15.41) tff depends only on the initial density PO and is inversely proportional to its square root. The free-fall time gives the right order of magnitude for the duration of gravitational collapse but rather as a lower limit because all retarding effects, like rotation or pressure gradients, are excluded. It is often useful to compare tff with the time scale of other processes, such as fragmentation of the cloud into subunits, gas cooling, frosting of molecules onto dust particles, grain coagulation and so forth. 15.2.5 The critical mass for gravitational instability Although in any interstellar cloud there is always some gravitational pull which tries to compress it, clouds are generally not in the stage of collapse. If they were, the star-formation rate would be orders of magnitude higher than what one observes. J Jeans was the first to give a quantitative answer to the question under what conditions a cloud collapses and the stability criterion bears his name. It is valid only when rotation, magnetic fields, turbulence or outer forces are absent. In a medium of constant temperature T, the basic gas-dynamical equations of momentum and mass continuity for the time-dependent variables velocity v and density P are I - - gradP - grad¢ P av - + (v· grad)v = at ap . - + dlV(pV) = O. at (15.42) (15.43)"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"Clouds near gravitational equilibrium 481 The gravitational potential ¢ is given by the Poisson equation t>.¢ = 47TGp (15.44) and the gas pressure P by the equation of state (15.26), P = kpT 1m = pv;\" where m is the mean particle mass and V s the sound velocity of (15.27). Let the medium intitially be uniform and at rest. We introduce a small perturbation, denoted by the subscript 1, and examine whether it grows or not. If the initial values of density and velocity are PO = 0 and Vo = constant, at some later time P = PO + PI v = Vo + Vt. Writing the density change PI in the form of a plane wave, PI ex: ei(kz+ w1 ) one obtains 222 w = k V s - 47TGPO. (15.45) If the perturbation PI increases exponentially, the cloud is unstable. This occurs when w is imaginary (w 2 < 0), i.e. when the wavenumber k is below some critical value kJ (the letter J stands for Jeans) given by Do not confuse the symbol k for the wavenumber with Boltzmann's constant k. So a cloud of density P and temperature T is unstable to collapse if it has a size greater than r;;u LJ=y~. For a cloud of molecular hydrogen (m = 2mH), (15.46) (15.47) where n is the number density of hydrogen molecules per cm 3 .

This derivation of the critical mass MJ from perturbation theory is logically not clean. A homogeneous medium at rest cannot be in equilibrium. If it were, V ¢ and thus t>.¢ would have to vanish but that is impossible because of the Poisson equation (15.44). All constants in the preceding equations (15.46)- (15.49) should, therefore, not be taken too literally. However, the Jeans criterion is qualitatively correct and very useful. For example, by measuring the temperature T, linear size L and mass M of a suspected protostellar condensation, formula (15.49) helps decide whether it should collapse or not. 15.2.6 Implications of the Jeans criterion 15.2.6.1 The role of dust in gravitational stability Because an isothermal collapse of a molecular cloud requires radiation losses, the dust optical depth T, from the cloud center to the surface, must be smaller than unity at wavelengths where dust emission is efficient, so When the optical depth is transformed into T = (~)2 Kd T2 4Gm ! MJ one sees that clumps of very low mass cannot freely radiate the gravitational energy released in the collapse. Using for Kd the Planck mean absorption coefficent Kp of equation (13.33), the minimum fragment mass that can undergo free collapse is (15.50) For T = 20 K, min(MJ) '\" 0.04 MG' Of course, these numbers should not be taken at their face value but the remarkably strong dependence of MJ on the cloud temperature may explain the observational fact that in starburst galactic nuclei, where the dust is warm (Td ::: 30 K), the IMF is heavily biased towards massive stars and low-mass stars do not seem to form at all. 15.2.6.2 Fragmentation and thermodynamic instability During cloud contraction, gravitational energy is converted into heat. Initially, the collapse is isothermal because dust is a very effective coolant; gas cooling is relatively inefficient. Continuing our crude analysis of cloud collapse, we thus notice from (15.48) that a gravitationally unstable and contracting cloud has the tendency to break up into fragments because the critical mass MJ decreases proportionally with T 3 / p as the average cloud density p rises. Smaller subunits"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"Clouds near gravitational equilibrium 483 of the mother cloud become unstable as long as the temperature does not rise faster than pl/3. This process, called fragmentation, is fundamental. The isothermal phase ends when the cloud becomes opaque to the cooling radiation. In a homogeneously contracting cloud, for which R 3 p = constant, the dust optical depth T grows proportionally to R- 2 ; for inhomologous contraction, the rise is even steeper. So as the cloud shrinks, T must at some moment exceed unity. Compression then leads to heating and pressure gradients build up which stop the collapse: a hydrostatic core forms. When the gravitational energy is not radiated away, the gas behaves adiabatically, 8Q = dU + P dV = 0, and where Y = C p / C y is the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to that at constant volume. Isothermality implies Y = 1. According to (15.48), there is gravitational instability if y falls below 4 YCf = 3· (15.51) Besides fragmentation, the value YCf also figures in protostellar evolution (section 15.3.2). 15.2.6.3 Further remarks on the Jeans criterion • The Jeans instability criterion is also valid when the gas pressure is due to supersonic turbulence (because it just compares kinetic with gravitational energy). One must then replace, in the corresponding formulae, the sound velocity V s by the turbulent velocity, and the thermal energy by the energy of the turbulent motions. • Suppose in some place of a cloud the gas is contracting. The information about the contraction travels through the cloud in a time ttray. If ttray is shorter than the free-fall time ttf of (15.41), the cloud will be stable. Otherwise, it cannot respond quickly enough to the density perturbation and collapse will ensue. The condition together with (15.27) for the sound velocity, also yields the Jeans mass or Jeans length. • When one applies the virial theorem in the form of (15.20), where the outer pressure is absent and the gravitational energy equals twice the thermal energy, to a gas sphere of mass M, radius R and with M/m gas particles, one gets M 3 2-· -kT. m 2"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"484 Stars and their formation Within a factor of order unity, one immediately recovers the formulae for LJ and MJ, (15.46) and (15.48). The radius of the critical Ebert-Bonnor sphere also has the same form as the Jeans length (see (15.38) and (15.46)) and the two expressions are also practically equivalent. • Any spherical cloud supported against its gravity by an internal pressure P becomes unstable when P ex: p4/3, independently of the physical origin of P. So the critical value Yef also holds for magnetic pressure P mag . We can thus extract from the Jeans criterion (15.48) the critical mass M mag in the presence of a magnetic field (see section 15.2.7). Indeed, when we rewrite equation (15.48) as MJ = (n 14G)3/2 p 3 / 2 1 p2 and insert, for P, the magnetic pressure P mag = B 2 18n, we are led to M mag in (15.53), again but for a factor of order unity. 15.2.7 Magnetic fields and ambipolar diffusion 15.2.7.1 Critical mass/or magnetized clumps When a cloud is pervaded by a magnetic field, its net effect is to lend further support against collapse. One can approximately extend the virial equation (15.18) so that it incorporates magnetic forces. As the terms in (15.18) represent global cloud energies, one expects the new term for the magnetic field to be equal to the total magnetic field energy (see (1.56)). Indeed, for a spherical cloud threaded by a uniform field of strength B, equation (15.18) is generalized to 3 3GM 2 I 3 2 4n R Po = 3NkT - -- + - R B . 5R 3 (15.52) If the field is frozen into the cloud, the magnetic flux is conserved and the relation B R 2 = constant holds no matter whether the cloud is contracting or expanding. The gravitational and magnetic term in (15.52) have then the same II R -dependence and if one form of energy, gravitational or magnetic, dominates at the beginning, it will do so throughout the subsequent evolution. The cloud can, therefore, only collapse if 3G M 2 1 5 R > R 3 B 2 /3. This condition leads to a minimum mass for instability in the presence of a magnetic field, M mag , which can obviously be written in two ways, (15.53) The second expression for M mag contains the flux <t> = n R 2 B through the clump. When the analysis is extended and cloud flattening taken into account, the proportionality factor drops, from 0/3n = 0.24 to 0.13; but such refinements are academic as estimates based on the virial theorem are rough anyway. We conclude that for R = 0.1 pc and B = 10 {tG, the critical mass for collapse is '\" I MG."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"Clouds near gravitational equilibrium 485 It is not easy to determine the strength of the magnetic field in molecular cloud cores but if one extrapolates from the lower density environment, where measurements are easier and B is at least I {tG, to clump densities, one ends up with a field strength of '\" I 0 {tG or more. A I M 0 cloud can, therefore, only contract if its radius is smaller than \"'0.1 pc. For the extrapolation, one assumes a relation B ex: pn between gas density and field strength. For homogeneous contraction (R 3 ex: p-I), flux freezing (B R 2 = consant) implies n = ~; in the case of equipartition between thermal energy of the gas and magnetic energy, n = ~; a more elaborate analysis yields ~ :s n :s ~ [Mou9l]. 15.2.7.2 Time scale of ambipolar diffusion Of course, all this is correct only if the magnetic field is coupled to the gas, otherwise there is no interaction. Although the interstellar matter is mainly neutral, cosmic rays alone can probably keep one out of 10 7 gas particles ionized, even in molecular cloud cores, and this should be sufficient to effectively freeze in the magnetic field. The strength of the coupling between gas and field is expressed through a diffusion timescale td, which we now define for a spherical cloud of mass M and radius R. Let the cloud be close to equilibrium so that the gravitational force is balanced by the magnetic field. The ions are then kept at their position while the neutrals drift slowly across the field lines under the influence of gravity. The process is called ambipolar diffusion. Assuming that the density of the neutrals is much larger than the ion density, n » ni, and that both kinds of particles have the same mass m, each ion imparts to the neutrals per second the momentum n(au) . mWd, where Wd is the drift speed between the two components and (au) an average over thermal velocity times cross section. The force balance for I cm 3 is thus GM R2 nm = nin(au)mwd from which follows the ambipolar diffusion time R ni 3 13ni tad = - = ---(au) ::::: 7 x 10 - yr.

With nil n = 10- 7 , the diffusion time tad is several million years. All this suggests that a cloud must first get rid of its magnetic field through ambipolar diffusion before it can collapse. As ambipolar diffusion is a slow process compared to dynamical contraction, it limits the pace at which stars can form. Should the degree of ionization be much above 10- 7 , for example, because the medium is clumpy and stray UV photons manage to penetrate into the cloud interior, the diffusion time tad would exceed the cloud lifetime and collapse could not occur."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"(15.55) (15.56) 486 Stars and their formation 15.3 Gravitational collapse 15.3.1 The presolar nebula 15.31.1 Gravitational and thermal energy To get a feeling for the parameters of a protostellar cloud, let us consider the presolar nebula. It must have had a mass of 1 M 0 , possibly a bit more as some matter was dispersed and did not fall onto the star. Evidence from molecular lines and dust radiation from low-mass protostellar clumps indicates a temperature T '\" 10 K. Equation (15.38) then yields a critical cloud radius of about R = 0.05 pc or 1.54 x 10 17 cm and a density p '\" 1.3 x 10- 19 g cm- 3 , corresponding to a molecular hydrogen density somewhat above 3 x 10 4 cm- 3 .

Today, the Sun has a radius R 0 = 7 x 10 10 cm and a mean density P0 ::::: 1.4 g cm- 3 . So on the way from the protostellar cloud to the main sequence, there are vast changes: the radius shrinks by a factor'\" 10 7 , the density increases by 20 powers of ten, and the cold neutral gas turns into a hot plasma of over 10 7 K with thermonuclear reactions.

We know this from the position of T Tau stars in the Hertzsprung- Russell diagram. Half of the released gravitational energy, namely G M 2 /4 R 0 '\" 10 48 erg, has gone into heating. As a result, the gas has acquired an average temperature of \"'3 x 10 6 K, a reasonable mean value for the Sun. The other half was radiated away. Over one free-fall time, this gives a mean luminosity of \"'40 L 0 . So very elementary considerations suggest that the Sun was, at least, during some of its protostellar evolution more luminous than it is today. 15.31.2 Rotational and magnetic energy A protostellar cloud rotates. This is what the Milky Way does and what all other celestial objects do. The galactic disk does not rotate rigidly but differentially and the angular frequency w decreases with galactic radius R as described by Oor1's constants A and B: 1 dwo A = - -Ro- ::::: 15 km S-I kpc- I 2 dRo 1 dwo 1 -I -B = -Ro- +wo::::: lOkms- kpc . 2 dRo (15.57) (15.58)"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"Gravitational collapse 487 They are determined observationally and refer to the locus of the Sun where w = wo and R = Ro.

We may envisage a large cloud to revolve around its own axis at an angular frequency w = Idv/dRol ::::: 1.6 x 10- 16 S-I, a few times smaller than wo. As protostellar clouds have undergone some contraction by which they were spun up, w '\" 10- 15 S-I seems a fair guess for them. Note: the previously cited values of A and - B are not up-to-date but easy to remember. Their uncertainty is about 20%. In more recent analyses, the numbers for both A and - B tend to converge around 12.5 km S-I kpc- I ; this would reduce w accordingly [O1l98]. A constant density sphere has a moment of inertia I = ~ M R 2 . For a presolar cloud, the initial rotational energy becomes E rot = ! I w 2 '\" 10 37 erg. Although this is small compared to E grav or Etherm, conservation of angular momentum I w implies E rot ex: R- 2 , so the rotational energy rises steeply as the radius shrinks. This raises a fundamental problem in the theory of star formation: How do we get rid of the angular momentum?

This, however, is not what one observes.

Because"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"488 Stars and their formation of the complexity of the numerical results, they usually cannot be adequately presented in plots but have to be visualized in motion pictures. Inevitably, a naive understanding of what is happening gets lost. Here and in section 15.3.3, we, therefore, sketch simplified scenarios which nevertheless catch important aspects of the collapse stages. The dynamical equations of a spherical cloud can be written as (cf. (15.42) and (15.43)) au au I ap GM r -+u-+--+--=o at ar p ar r 2 ap I a 2 -+--(r pu)=O. at r 2 ar (15.60) (15.61) The geometry is here one-dimensional: density p, pressure P v; p and velocity u depend only on radius r, and on time t. The gas is driven by the gradient of the pressure P and by the gravitational attraction. My is the mass of a sphere of radius r, so aM r 2 -- - 47Tr p = O. ar (15.62) During the early phases, the collapse is isothermal. The sound velocity V s is then constant and in (15.60) the derivative ap jar = v;ap/ar. In this case, and as long as there are no shocks, it is straightforward to transform (15.60) to (15.62) into difference equations and solve them numerically; an example is presented in figure 15.8. For a fixed cloud volume, the non-trivial outer boundary condition reads as u = O. When the cloud becomes optically thick (see section 15.2.6), the assumption of isothermality has to be abandoned. One must then add to (15.60)-(15.62) an equation for the conservation of energy (first law of thermodynamics) and for the transport of radiation. For the latter, one often uses a frequency-averaged (grey) approximation in the spirit of (13.29). The numerical solution of the full set of equations [Lar69] leads to a p ex: r- 2 density distribution even when starting at constant density (see figure 15.8). The core becomes opaque when about 0.01 M 0 of gas have been accumulated within a radius r '\" 10 14 cm. The submillimeter dust radiation is then trapped, the core warms up and settles into hydrostatic equilibrium. When the gas temperature reaches \"'2000 K, molecular hydrogen dissociates. The released gravitational energy is then no longer used to increase T but to separate the hydrogen atoms. Initially, the cloud is made up mostly of H2 for which Y = 7/5 > Yer of (15.51). But when hydrogen dissociates, Y falls below the critical value of 4/3 and the hydrostatic core begins to collapse. This second collapse is halted only when Y rises again above 4/3, which happens at a central density of '\" 10- 3 g cm- 3 . As one can read from figure 15.8 or 15.9, flow velocities become quickly supersonic because the sound speed is only'\" I km S-1 in a cloud of 10K.

This restricted class of solutions does not add anything new to the one-dimensional numerical calculations of [Lar69] but because of its simplicity, it is very instructive. The similarity solutions can be found by introducing a dimensionless variable which expresses some relation between rand t, let us choose r x=-. vst Because of similarity, the dependent variables velocity, density and mass are the product of a function of t times a function of x.

We, therefore, begin with an elementary experiment illustrating Newton's friction law (figure 15.10). A flat piece of arbitrary material and total surface area 2A is dipped into a vessel filled with a viscous fluid of density p and kinematic viscosity coefficient v.

However, the increase cannot continue up to the stellar surface because the star rotates quite slowly, at least, T Tauri stars do. We can determine the constant C in (15.87) if we assume that w is abruptly reduced in a thin layer immediately above the stellar surface and that in this layer, at the point where the first derivative Wi vanishes, w can be approximated by JCM*I R~ where R* is the stellar radius.

We did not discuss the physical processes involved or how the kinematic viscosity coefficent v depends on the parameters of the gas. The reason for viscosity in a gas flow with a velocity gradient is the exchange of momentum perpendicular to the flow direction. In an ideal gas at temperature T, where the atoms have a mean velocity (u) and free path e, one works out that v = !(u)L (15.89)"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"502 Stars and their formation Because in a Maxwellian velocity distribution (u) ex: -Jr and because e grows only weakly with T, one expects for an ideal gas something like v ex: -Jr. We will not prove formula (15.89) but it is qualitatively understandable. Looking at the flow depicted in figure 15.10, one realizes that the deeper the atoms penetrate from one layer into the next and the faster they move, the more momentum they transfer and the stronger the friction. If n is the number density of the particles and a their collisional cross section, the free path length is (15.90) The product vp, which appears in the basic equation (15.81) of a Kepler disk, is thus independent of the density p (the surface density 2: equals p multiplieed by the disk height h). For hydrogen molecules, a is of order 10- 15 cm 2 and the ensuing value vp is far too small to produce any dynamical effect on the disk evolution. But our previous analysis on internal friction applies to laminar flows. When the gas is turbulent, the viscosity is greatly enhanced. Turbulence means that superimposed on the average flow there are violent chaotic motions on all scales capable of very effectively exchanging momentum. The largest eddies determine the character of the flow. This becomes evident from the Reynolds number (15.93) which contains the linear dimension of the object. It is reasonable to use, for the size of the largest eddies, the disk height h and for their velocity the sound speed V s ; supersonic motions would be quickly damped in shocks. In analogy to (15.89), one writes the viscosity coefficient (a :s I) (15.91) where a is a fudge factor introduced to express the inherent uncertainty. Proposing a '\" 0.01 would not lead to a riot among astronomers. Disks with v in the form of (15.91) are called a-disks [Sha73]. If they are in hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction, one can substitute h from (15.85) so that for a turbulent Kepler disk the viscosity is (15.92) Although this expression is too nice to be true, it gives some handle on the surface density 2:.

In laboratory experiments, the flow around objects is laminar when Re < 10, turbulent when Re > 10 5 , and the critical range is Re '\" 3000. These numbers give some rough general guidance. To guarantee an effective outward transport of angular momentum in an accretion disk, very large Reynolds numbers seem to be required. Possible ways to achieve them are convection in the disk or, if the disk is permeated by a magnetic field, twisting of the field lines in the rotating plasma. The Reynolds number (15.93) increases with velocity (a strong wind whirls up more dust), and with the size of the object (a big body disturbs the flow more effectively), and also when the viscosity decreases (water is more likely to be turbulent than honey). With respect to the last point, it is, however, puzzling that a small viscosity, which should mean little momentum exchange between neighboring stream lines yields a high Reynolds number and thus implies turbulence. The answer to this apparent contradiction follows from the analysis of the flow equation of an incompressible fluid. There, in the term containing the viscosity, the smallness of v is more than compensated by a large second-order gradient in the vorticity rot v. 15.4.7 Disk heating by viscosity In a steady state, the heat generated in the optically thick disk by internal friction is lost radiatively from its surface. Let F(r) denote the outward flux at radius r on one side of the disk surface.

An observer sees, of course, only one side of the disk.

The other half is stored in rotational energy. If the disk extends to the star, the power (15.98) is liberated in a thin layer at the stellar surface where rapid braking takes place from the Kepler velocity Vcp to the usually much smaller rotational velocity of the star. As the energy is released over an area A small compared to the stellar surface, it will lead to hot UV continuum radiation of luminosity L uv. An estimate of the sprectrum is obtained by assuming blackbody emission of temperature T uv and putting Luv = AaT0v. Alternatively, the disk may be prevented from reaching the star by magnetic forces of the stellar magnetic field. At a distance of a few stellar radii, where magnetic and kinetic energy are about equal, the accreting gas is channelled from the disk along the magnetic field lines upward in the z-direction and then falls in a loop onto the star at high stellar latitudes. The result is again a hot continuum. Such a model can better explain the observational fact that the emission lines of T Tauri stars often have a width of several hundred km S-I. In the case where the gas rotates in a disk all the way to the star, it is difficult to produce such large radial velocities, i.e. velocities along the line of sight.

Its infrared continuum spectrum yields not only, in an obvious fashion, the infrared luminosity or an estimate of the dust temperature. An analysis of the spectrum by means of radiative transfer calculations often allows us to get an idea of the three-dimensional distribution of the dust with respect to the embedded stares). For this purpose, one constructs models that are supposed to resemble the source and varies the model parameters until agreement between theory and observation is achieved. Fitting an extensive observational data set is laborious and requires occasional intuition. To solve such a task, a senior scientist needs a good student (the reverse is not true).

When a star is born in a molecular cloud, it disturbs the interstellar medium in its vicinity through its wind, jet or radiation pressure, and then neighboring clumps are pushed beyond the brink of gravitational stability, too. The isolated birth of a star is a rare event but it can happen in globules. These are cloudlets that have been stripped off from larger complexes. They have masses of '\" 10 M 0 and appear as dark spots on photographic plates. Globules are bathed in a radiation field which heats them from outside and we want to evaluate their infrared emission in the absence of an internal source. Let us consider a spherical globule of 2.6 M 0 at a distance of 200 pc with diameter of 2r = 1.2 x 10 17 em.

Using the standard dust model described in section 12.4, the overall visual optical thickness through the cloud center amounts to 282 mag, so the globule is very opaque. We compute the radiative transfer for an external radiation field J;xt that is, when integrated over frequency, four times stronger than the ISRF of figure 8.2. Such excursions in the radiative intensity can produce remarkable effects and occur when the globule is near a star (for example, at a distance of 1.5 pc from a B3V star). We assume that J;xt consists of two components: a hard one described by a diluted blackbody of T = 18000 K that is meant to represent the UV flux from stares), and a very soft one of spectral shape v 2 Bv(T = 20 K) that mimics the ubiquitous far infrared radiation. The relative strength of these radiation fields is chosen such that the grain temperatures lie between 17 and 27 K at the surface of the globule where the UV photons are responsible for heating and around 7 K in the cloud center. The globule in figure 16.1 appears observationally first of all as a very cold submillimeter source. Its emission has a broad maximum around 250 /Lm. The millimeter spectrum comes from the coldest dust, it is fit by a modified Planck curve (section 5.4.3) of only 7 K. There is a skin layer of thickness Av ::::: I mag where the big grains are much warmer (\"'20 K) and these grains account for the flux between 50 and 200 /Lm. The presence of very small grains (vsg) and PAHs in the skin layer has the remarkable effect that the source becomes visible in the mid infrared. As discussed in section 8.5, such tiny grains with heat capacities of merely a few eV make a big upward leap every time they absorb an ultraviolet photon and this produces an emission spectrum entirely different from big grains. Although the tiny grains account for only a few percent of the total dust mass, they absorb some 20-30% of the UV light and their excitation therefore radically changes the infrared appearance of the source. Most noticeable are the PAH features (section 12.2). Without vsg and PAHs, the globule would only be detectable in the far infrared and beyond. The presence of the PAHs has the further interesting consequence that it leads to important heating of the interior by mid infrared photons. Without them, the core would be extremely cold (Td ::::: 5 K).

HH108MMS appears at 14 !Lm in absorption against the diffuse background and this offers the opportunity to derive, from the variation of the surface brightness over the source, the optical depth and the density profile in the source. Alternative methods to obtain a density profile, by observing millimeter dust emission or certain molecular lines, are less direct and, therefore, less reliable. The geometrical configuration for our analysis is drawn in figure 16.4. HH108MMS is embedded in a molecular cloud and viewed from Earth through the veil of zodiacal light of the solar system. Four regions contribute to the observed 14 !Lm flux: • The background of intensity 10. Our globular model in section 16.1.1 suggests that this radiation is due to emission by PAHs and vsg heated in the surface layer on the backside of the molecular cloud. • The far and near side of the molecular cloud with temperatures TI and T3 and optical depths TI and T3, respectively. We put Tel = TI + T3. • The absorbing core (protostar) of optical depth T2 and temperature T2. • The interplanetary dust of the solar system. It emits zodiacal light of intensity I z and is, in fact, by far the strongest contributor to the 14!Lm flux. The molecular cloud and the absorbing core are certainly cold (T < 20 K) and have no mid infrared emission of their own (BI4fLm(Ti) ::::: 0, i = 1,2,3). The intensity in the direction of the absorbing core (source) can, therefore, be written as Is = I z + Ioe-(r el +r 2 ), and towards the background, at a position next to the absorbing core, h = I z + Ioe- rel . As the zodiacal light is constant on scales of a few arcsec, one gets (16.2) Is and h are known from observations. To find the optical depth T2 across the protostar, let us denote the maximum value of T2 by T2,max and the corresponding intensity by Is, max· The 1.3 mm flux towards that position yields for the central beam an average optical depth T1.3mm '\" 10- 2 (see (8.19)).

The total cloud mass, including the embryo star, is about one solar mass. In the early phase of collapse, the luminosity comes from the release of kinetic energy of the free-falling envelope in a shock front at the surface of the hydrostatic core. Its value, Lshock, is given by (15.63) and (15.72) but one needs hydrodynamic calculations to relate M* to R*. They suggest that for a clump of initially one solar mass, Lshock is 30 L 0 and fairly constant over one free-fall time [Win80]. Only near the end of the accretion phase when most of the matter in the envelope has rained onto the star does the shock luminosity decline and the energy generation from contraction (section 15.2.1) and later from hydrogen burning take over. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the protostar approaches the main sequence from above, at roughly constant color B - V. In the example of figure 16.7, the outer cloud radius Rout = 1.3 x 10 17 cm is determined by the critical radius (15.38) of an Ebert-Bonnor sphere. The density p changes in the protostellar envelope like p ex: r- 3j2 (see (15.70)). The total cloud optical depth thus depends foremost on the inner cloud radius, Rin. There are various ways to fix Rin in the model. One may equal it to the evaporation temperature of dust, which would imply a value less than 1 AU. Or one may use the centrifugal radius rcenfug of (15.73) assuming that inside this radius gas and dust are strongly flattened into a disk. The disk emission would then have to be evaluated separately (section 16.3) and added, in a consistent fashion, to the flux from the spherical cloud. As the numbers extracted from equation (15.73) for r cenfug are very rough, one may set Rin equal to the radius of the solar planetary system (40 AU). We opt for a value in between, we put Rin = 2 x 10 13 cm and neglect the disk. In the particular presentation of figure 16.7, we plot v F v instead of the observed flux F v . This has the advantage that for any two logarithmic frequency intervals [VI, V2] and [v;, v~] of the same length, i.e. VI/V2 = v;;v~, equal areas under the curve v F v imply equal spectral luminosities over these frequency intervals. One can thus directly compare the energy emission from different spectral regions. Figure 16.7 shows models at five evolutionary stages, for a source distance of 150 pc. The curves labeled 1 to 5 follow a time sequence. During the collapse, the visual optical depth from the center to the cloud edge as well as the clump mass (without the embryo star) decline, the corresponding values are Av = 560,560, 57,11.4,1.1 mag and Mcloud = 0.93,0.93,0.093,0.019,0.0018 M 0 . At stage 1, the accretion phase starts and the luminosity is still low (L = 1 L 0 ). During the main accretion period (stage 2 and 3), the luminosity is much higher (L = 30 L 0 ). It drops later to 3 L 0 (stage 4) and 2 L 0 (stage 5) in the T Tauri phase. The spectral index ex between 2.2 and 20 /Lm, which is used in the classification of protostars (section 7.3.4) has, for curve 1-5, the values 12, 12, 1.7,0.2, -0.2.

Interestingly, the dust properties are not cmciaL all dust models give similar Clllves, except for the outer cloud envelope where the grains may be icy and fluffy. Second, the protostar is always embedded in a larger cloud complex which distorts the spectnnll of the protostar because it leads to additional extinction in the near and even mid infrared and to an enhancement of the submillimeter emission. Third, a real cloud is more complicated, it is asymmetric due to rotation and the presence of magnetic fields which makes the obselved spectrum dependent on the viewing angle. Finally, one expects an accretion disk around the embryo star whose stmcture and emission have not been chuified."},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"The collapse phase 515 16.2.3 Kinematics of protostellar collapse The search for a protostar has occupied observing astronomers for decades. It may continue to do so for many more to come because there is no exact definition what a protostar is. The term is applied loosely to anything at the verge of gravitational stability to the stage when it becomes optically visible. The ultimate proof that one has found a collapsing object has to come from the velocity field of the interstellar clump: without a kinematic signature, the collapse cannot be identified with certainty. As interstellar dust does not supply us with velocity information, we have to turn to atomic or molecular lines. This is a healthy reminder that even dust is not everything. Ideally, in the study of a protostellar clump, one has for each physical domain, characterized by a certain interval of temperature and density, a specific transition of a particular molecule with which one can probe the conditions in the gas. The source is mapped in various transitions of several such molecules to cover the full physical range encountered in the cloud. The observations are carried out with high spatial resolution so that one can resolve the cloud structure. When the observed lines are analysed in a radiative transfer model, infall betrays itself by distinctive features in the profiles. The structure of a spherically symmetric, collapsing protostellar cloud was sketched in section 15.3: the gas density decreases with radius r like a r- 3 / 2 and the infall velocity v goes with r- I / 2 . The isovelocity curves with respect to the Doppler shift toward the Sun are displayed in figure 16.8. Along a line of sight, emission from position 1 (3) interacts with the gas at position 2 (4) because the radial velocities at the two points are equal. After an embryo star has formed, the temperature will decrease away from the star because the cloud has an internal energy source. Point 2 (3) will, therefore, be hotter than point 1 (4). If the line is optically thick, one receives red-shifted emission only from the cold position 4 because emission from the warm gas at 3 is absorbed, and likewise blue-shifted emission is detected only from the warm position 2. This leads to the signature of infall: an asymmetric profile where the blue peak is stronger than the red one. If the line, however, is optically thin, as for rare isotopic species, the profiles will be symmetric because of the symmetric configuration in the near and far side of the cloud. To illustrate what the lines might look like, we present in figure 16.9 and 16.10 model calculations for the early phase of protostellar collapse, before the release of gravitational energy in a shock front. The cloud is then isothermal. We choose a kinetic gas temperature Tkin = 17 K, a p ex: r- 3 / 2 density dependence and an infall velocity u = 5.5 x 10 12 r- I / 2 cm S-I (which implies an embryo star mass M of 0.11 M 0 if one puts u 2 = 2G M / r). The clump has a radius R = 10 17 cm and its total gas mass (without the embryo star) equals 0.65 M 0 . The computations are performed in the micro turbulent approximation described in section 13.5.3, assuming a constant turbulent linewidth of 0.2 km S-I.

A good tracer for the densities prevailing in a protostar are the rotational transitions ofCS. The molecule is fairly abundant ([CSlI[H2] '\" 2x 10- 9 ) and in its physics similar to CO (section 14.2.1). CS has, however, a much larger dipole moment ('-1- = 1.98 Debye) than CO and thus requires higher densities for excitation (section 14.2.2). This, ideally. has the pleasant side effect that all tenuous foreground and background mateliaJ, not related to the prolostar. becomes invisible. Because the Einstein coefficients change roughly with j3 (see fOlmula (14.4)). one penetrates progressively deeper into the cloud as one climbs the j-Iadder. So observatiollsofthe higher j ~ j - I transitions refer to the core region where dellSities and velocities are larger. The spectra in figures 16.9 and 16.10 show the CS lines of upper level jup = 2,4,5 for different angular resolution of the telescope.

The problem with using (16.6) is to find the right radial temperature variation T (r). As the disk is not a blackbody, equation (13.50) can only be an approximation. 16.32.2 The influence of grain size Nevertheless, to get an idea how the grain size influences the spectrum, we apply (16.6) to the disk around a T Tau star with the same radial temperature profile T(r) as in figure 16.12 and with an outer radius Rout = 20 AU. For the surface density, we assume ~ r) = bor-a with ex = 1. In the example of figure 16.13, Mdisk::::: 0.01 MG. Before we can numerically evaluate (16.6), we have to specify the wavelength-dependent mass absorption coefficient, K A , of dust. As we are dealing with a disk, the grains may be quite big as a result of coagulation, after all, even planets might form. A power-law approximation K A ex: A -2 according to (8.10) is then not warranted and K A must be calculated from Mie theory (section 2.6.5).

The temperature T(z) is now detellnined from the radiative transfer outlined in section 13.3. As an example. we choose a main sequence star of type B9V (L. = 100 1..0. M. = 3 M o , T. = 12000 K.

The viewing angle i for the upper curve is 90°. for the two lower ones, i := 78° and 52°. respectively. In the far infrared. the disk annulus is opaque up to -150 I1.In. The flux is then reduced because of geometrical contraction if one looks at the disk from the side (i < 90°).

There might be even much larger holes if planetesimals or planets have fonned. The rise in the far infrared in figure 16.15 is due 10 the large grazing angle. It is the result of inflation.

Nevertheless, the radiation field within them is hard and the grains are in a harsh environment. This leads to ample"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"Reflection nebulae 525 excitation of very small grains and PAHs. We demonstrate in the models here the tremendous effect which they have on the spectrum of a reflection nebula. The visual optical depth of a reflection nebula is never large C;S I) and we may, therefore, assume that the grains are heated directly by the star, without any foreground attenuation. Computing the radiative transfer is therefore not really necessary. The infrared emission from the dust itself is, of course, also optically thin. To evaluate it, we adopt the dust model outlined in section 12.4 but slightly simplify it to make the role of the PAHs more transparent. We use only one kind of PAHs with Nc = 50 carbon atoms, hydrogenation parameter !HjC = 0.3 and cutoff wavelength Acut = 0.42 /Lm, and lump the four C-H out-of-plane bends (table 12.1) into one resonance, at 11.3 /Lm. The mass fraction of the PAHs is 6%. The very small grains (vsg), which are made of graphite and silicate, contain 10% of the mass of the big particles and have uniform radii of lOA. The big (MRN) grains are exactly as described in section 12.4. The dust emission at various positions in the nebula is shown in figure 16.16. The source parameters are listed in the figure caption, absolute fluxes can be read from figure 16.18. Far from the star (right frame, distance D = 5 X 10 18 cm), the big grains are cool, their mid infrared emission is negligible and the maximum occurs beyond 100 /Lm. The spectrum below 50 /Lm is then entirely due to PAHs. Closer to the star, the big grains become hotter. But even at D = 5 x 10 16 cm, where the maximum in the spectrum has shifted to \"'25 /Lm, the PAHs dominate below 15 /Lm. The relative strengths of the PAH features, the band ratios, are not sensitive to the stellar distance, only the absolute flux weakens if the dust is far out. This becomes evident from figure 16.17. A similar situation is encountered in figure 8.14 with respect to the very small grains where the colors (flux ratios) are almost constant over the nebula. In the present example, however, the vsg play only a minor role. To exemplify the influence of PAH size, the computations are repeated for a distance D = 5 x 10 17 cm but now the number of carbon atoms in a PAH, Nc, is varied from 30 to 500 (figure 16.19). The hydrogenation parameter, !HjC, changes according to (12.11). The big PAHs are, on average, cooler than the small ones and it is, therefore, harder to excite their high-frequency bands. This is best seen by comparing the C-H resonances at 3.3 and 11.3 /Lm. The emission ratio, E3.3/Ell.3, is much larger for small (hot) than for big (cool) PAHs. It is also instructive to see how the temperature of the big (MRN) particles changes with distance, grain size and chemical composition. Summarizing, the silicates are always colder than the amorphous carbon grains, and big particles always colder than small ones of the same chemistry. At a distance D = 5 X 10 18 cm, the temperature of the silicates, T (Si), ranges from 16 to 20 K, that of the carbonaceous particles, T(aC), from 20 to 25 K. Corresponding numbers at distance D = 5 x 10 17 cm are: T(Si) = 33 .. .43 K and T(aC) = 46 ... 58 K.

The far infrared spectrum, therefore, refers to the galaxy as a whole. The big squares in the upper boxes of figure 16.20 and 16.21 roughly indicate the beam at 200 /Lm. In Mkn799, the flux SA between 50 /Lm and 1 mm can be approximated by one temperature component. Putting Sv ex: v 2 Bv(Td), a least-square fit yields Td = 31 K. For UGC2982, however, we need two components, one at about the same temperature as in Mkn799 (Td = 32 K), the other at 14 K, thus much colder and of lower integrated luminosity. Nevertheless, the cold component contains 90% of the mass. Because the total dust emission is proportional to T2 (see (8.14)), the heating rate for most of the dust in Mkn799 is a factor (31/14)6 ::::: 120 greater than in UGC2982 and the average stellar luminosity per unit volume correspondingly higher. Closely related to the disparate temperatures of the coldest component (14 K versus 31 K) is the discrepancy in the ratio of infrared luminosity over gas mass, LIR/ M gas . Expressing both quantities in solar units, LIR/ M gas '\" 5 for UGC2982, whereas this value is almost 20 times larger in Mkn799. A high ratio LIR/ M gas is often interpreted to imply a high efficiency for extracting luminosity from the gas via star formation. Exactly how much depends, of course, on the initial mass function (see figure 15.4). LIR/ M gas is thus regarded as an indicator of star-formation activity. In this scenario, Mkn799 is active whereas UGC2982 is quiescent. Periods of extreme star-formation efficiency (starbursts) are usually restricted to the nucleus of a galaxy (see section 16.6). Due to the strong concentration of both dust and luminosity, grains with temperatures below 30 K are absent in the center of a starburst galaxy, which would explain Td = 31 K for the coldest component in Mkn799. 16.6 Starburst nuclei 16.6.1 Repetitive bursts of star formation Galactic nuclei are extended stellar clusters that form the nuclear bulge. In roughly one out of ten, one finds at their center a high concentration of OB stars that must have been created in an episode of violent star formation, a so called starburst. The rate of astration during the burst cannot be sustained over a period much longer than 10 7 yr, otherwise the nucleus would run out of interstellar matter. The burst takes place in a region only a few hundred parsec across, often considerably less. The starburst nucleus is very bright, up to 10 12 L 0 , much brighter than the rest of the galaxy. The high luminosities advocate an initial mass function (IMF) heavily biased towards massive stars, with a lower limit ml much above the value of the solar neighborhood (\",0.IM 0 , section 15.1.6). Before we model the dust emission from a galactic nucleus, we sketch how the collective star formation possibly operates. Such a tentative explanation is always useful. It will guide us in the same way that a notion about the dynamics"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"532 Emission from young stars of protostellar collapse (section 15.3) guided us in calculating the protostellar spectra. In a galactic nucleus, the gas is gravitationally trapped in the potential well created by the bulge stars. Initially, before the burst, it is supported against collapse by circular as well as turbulent non-circular motions. As the turbulent energy is inevitably dissipated in cloud-cloud collisions, the gas sinks in the potential well and its density increases. Above a certain threshold, violent star formation sets in. A few million years later, the most massive stars explode as supernovae and their ejecta replenish the turbulent energy of the gas. The gas is then dispelled and star formation ends. The process is likely to be repetitive, as argued later, and this would explain why bursts are fairly common. A sequence of bright bursts may be initialized by a strong inflow of gas from the disk into the nucleus, possibly as a result of tidal interaction of the host galaxy with a neighbor. 16.6.1.1 Dynamics a/the gas in a galactic nucleus To estimate the strength of a burst, its duration and spatial extent, and to show the likely cyclic character of the phenomenon, we treat the interstellar matter in a galactic nucleus as one homogeneous gas cloud of mass M, radius r and turbulent energy ET [Tut95]. The following equations of a one-zone model describe the evolution of the cloud: r=u . 2 ET G[M*(r) + M] u = - - - -------;:;---- 3 Mr r 2 . ET .

In (16.10), {t denotes a constant mass inflow, from the disk or from the wind of old stars in the nuclear bulge. The quantity / is the volume filling factor of the gas, / < 1 implies clumping. M*(r) specifies the mass of the bulge stars within radius r; their lifetime is very long ('\" 10 10 yr) and their total mass much greater than the mass of the gas or the newly-born stars. The time scales for star formation and dissipation of turbulent energy are TSF and Tdis, respectively, VSN denotes the supernova rate and ESN the turbulent energy input into the gas per supernova explosion. It is easy to show that a protostellar clump can collapse only when the mean gas density exceeds the mean stellar density or when M ::: / M * in a galactic nucleus, otherwise tidal forces will disrupt the clump.

The fundamental feature of the bursts, their periodicity, is not very sensitive to the intial conditions or to the parameters that appear in the equations (except for the lower stellar mass limit ml, see later).

One way to derive the structure of the nucleus. to detennine how dust and stars are geometrically arranged. what the total extinction and the gas mass are. or to which spectral type the stars belong. is to model the dust emission spectrum. For this end. one has to compute the radiative transfer in a dust-filled stellar duster. A starburst nucleus contains many DB stars. We first convince ourselves that it is indeed necessary to treat the DB stars and their surroundings separately. as hot spots. following Ihe strategy in section 13.4. If one does not treat them properly. one grossly underrates the mid-infrared flux. This becomes evident from figure 16.23 where spectra are displayed calculated with and without hot spots.

Reproduced from Siebenmorgen, Kriigel and Laureijs 2001 Astron. Astrophys. 377 735 with permission from EDP Sciences. The PAHs and vsg further enhance the mid infrared flux over the already strong level produced by the hot spots and totally dominate this wavelength region. Interestingly, it is now not obvious at all how to derive, from the 10 !Lm silicate feature which lies between PAH bands, an absorption optical depth. We add that in view of the strong and hard radiation fields prevalent in a galactic nucleus with OB stars, the radiative transfer code must allow for the possibility of photo- destruction of PAHs and vsg (see section 12.2.3). A point source model of the same luminosity and spectral appearance as the exciting stars but where the stars are squeezed into a tiny volume at the center of the galactic nucleus is also of relevance and it is shown by the upper dotted curve in figures 16.23 and 16.24. It too yields a very strong mid-infrared flux but differs from the models with extended emission by its small angular size. Mid- infrared cross cuts of high spatial resolution over the galactic nucleus allow us to discriminate between a stellar cluster and a point source. A massive black hole with an accretion disk would appear to an observer as a point source. But it is one with a considerably harder emission spectrum than OB stars.

This can be checked observationally. However, spectral lines from multiply ionized atoms, which require for their excitation more energetic photons than are found in HI! regions, are generally a better diagnostic for the presence of a powerful non-thermal source. Hot spots and PAHs determine the mid infrared emission not only of starburst nuclei. Figure 16.25 shows the spectrum of the galaxy NGC 1808 where the star- formation activity in the center is very mild and only 10% of the total luminosity (L tot ::::: 5 x 10 10 L 0 ) comes from OB stars.
