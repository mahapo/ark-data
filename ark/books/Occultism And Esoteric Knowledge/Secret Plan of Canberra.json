For ten years he watched the architectural publications and then sure enough, there was an announcement before his eyes. Owing to busy practice in 14 states, the months slipped by and nothing was done about it, though doubtless the matter was brewing within, till finally, his wife, performing that valuable function of the Xantippes of the world, flew into a rage and told him that if he didn't start on the design that day she wouldn't do a stroke of drafting on the thing. The design was begun that day and after nine weeks of drivi ng work, towards midnight of a cold win- ter night, the box of drawings, too long to go into a taxi, was rushed with the doors open and the men without coats — no time to go up 16 stories to get them — across the city to the last train that could meet th e last boat for Australia, the imperturbable Mr Griffin himself the only one not quite fr antic by this time because to his mind if Australia was serious about the matter of th eir Federal Capital th ey wouldn't let the moment of arrival of the plans be the determining factor in their choice and, to his land planning mind they couldn't but be serious in such a matter. A year later the cable came that Walter Burley Griffin had won the prize. His words on receiving the message were — 'And then I shan't be able to see a plan better than mine'. (Marion Mahony Griffin, 'Can berra — its designer and its plan', The Federal Battle Magic of America pp 434-35) In 1913, a year after winning the Canberra co mpetition, Walter Burley Griffin declared: I have planned a city not like any other city in the world. I have planned an ideal city. Griffin's exposition in the initial Canberra plan — an ideal city — is generally regarded as a synthesis of the City Beautiful and Garden City movements which dominated town planning in the late nineteenth an d early twentieth centuries. In the City Beautiful model, derived from elements of baroque vista planning, architecture is set in sweeping piazzas and parkland penetrates the city centre. In the Garden City model, based on principles derived from Ebenezer Howard's Garden Cities of Tomorrow (1901), houses on individual blocks in suburban areas further away from the centre are domi- nated by landscaping. In Canberr a the parliamentary triangle reveals influences from the 1901 modifications to the plan for Washington DC and the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition, which espoused the Bea ux Arts baroque style; and less formal 'picturesque' principles applied to its suburban areas connect Canberra with English garden-towns such as Letchworth and Port Sunlight. Walter and Marion Griffin's for- mal parliamentary triangle reinforced the C ity Beautiful ideals while the informality of the Lake Park was strongly aligned to the 'picturesque'. 1 Canberra cannot, however, be understood simp ly in terms of either late nine- teenth century City Beautiful models or Howard's Garden City principles. While embracing such ideas, the initial plan's ove rarching concept establishes references to a W"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"4   SeCRCT   PLAN   Of CAM86RRA particular sacred geometry adopted by the Griffins. There is a symbolic content to their plan — incorporating, as it does, other significant paradigms derived from specific esoteric and co smological sources. The Griffins' use of the term 'ideal city' links their Canberra plan to an ancient a nd universal tradition of planning, which also underlies both the City Beautifu l and Garden City movements. Crucial to an understanding of the desi gn for Canberra, as developed from the Griffins' initial plan of 1912, is the rec ognition that the Land Axis connecting Mount Ainslie with the War Memorial, Anzac Parade, the lake system, the parliamentary tri- angle and Capital H i l l , extends to Bimb eri Peak, the highest mountain in the Brindabella ranges some 25 kilometres to th e south of the central city. Bimberi Peak, not Capital Hill, was designated as the term inus to the Land Axis both on the initial drawings and in the original report (see figure 2.3 and th e illustration on the back of the jacket). This north-south axis and the east-west Water Axis from Black Mountain passing through Fyshwick, the basins compri sing Lake Burley Griffin and along the Molonglo Valley, form a cross akin to th e monumental constructions of the ancient world such as Constantine's Rome. There, the axis urbis (city axis) connects St Peter's Basilica, the Capitoline Hill, the Via Sacra, the Temple of Venus and Rome, the Colosseum, St John's Lateran church, and extends to the Alban Hills, the home of the gods of antiquity (see figure 3.3). At the Colosseum it crosses another axis c onnecting the ancient basilicas of Santa Maria Maggior e and St Paul outside the walls. With the establishment of Christianity, the 'cross' of Rome became the model for the develop- ment of many European cities. Inspiration for the Griffins' original Canberra design is drawn from both ancient spiritual ideas and the Griffins' unde rstanding of geomancy — an ancient sci- ence placing man in harmony with the earth, which is common to both Eastern and Western cultures. Canberra, therefore, has affinities with Stonehenge, sacred Glastonbury, ancient Egyptian temples and pyr amids, even with the concept of the new Jerusalem. In common with them all, Canberra is constructed in accordance with ancient architectural and planning principles and the same sacred geometry emanating from the Vesica. The Vesica is the orifice formed from th e interpenetration of two equal circles, one sphere symbolic of the spiritual real m and the other symbolic of the world of material phenomena. Liberated from the Vesi ca are the circle, the square, the triangle, the rhombus and regular polygons which inte rrelate (figure 1.2). Their interrelations determine the geometrical structure of the in itial plan with its attendant architectural proposals; a framework clearly visible even now, and reinforced in Romaldo Giurgola's design for the new Parliament House. Added to the simple basic cross of Canbe rra, there is a seri es of interrelated and connected nodal points: in effect, all the m ountains — Black Mountain, Mount Ainslie, Mugga Mugga, Mount Pleasant and City Hill — are connected to the main Land Axis extending to Bimberi Peak on the e dge of the Australian Capital Territory. This concept reflects th e principle of the five sacred mountains i n feng shui (Chinese geomancy). The siting and massing of Giur gola's new Parliament House strongly sug- gests that he had in fact gr asped the underlying geomantic or der of the Griffins' initial plan even though Giurgola makes no refere nce to it in his published accounts of the "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Figure 1.2 Sacred geometry of the Vesica: circle, square, rhombus, equilateral triangle and regular polygons design. His new building, with its two huge ramped hemi cycles, its relationship to water areas and the surrounding mountain forms, produces an effect similar to a feng shui landscape, in which a building should ideal ly be sited in relation to embracing and protective mountain forms (the White Tige r and the Azure Dragon) with a slow- moving body of water in the dist ance (Lake Burley Griffin). It is such clear references in the Griffins' original plan to their wider sources of inspiration that makes it impossi- ble to interpret Canber ra solely as a product of the City Beau tiful and Garden City models. Nevertheless, such influences were ne ver made explicit by the Griffins. Just as the medieval master masons guarded their secr ets, the Griffins never revealed the basis of their design to the politicians and bureaucrats who condemned the initial plan as impractical. For this book the esoteric basis of the plan has had to be elucidated through a study of the Magic of America, a four-volume work written (but never pub- lished) by Marion Griffin at the end of her life. After the death of Walter in India in 1937, Marion returned to America and began working on the Magic of America, a record of their life and work experience together that she compiled from documentary material and her own re flections. The Magic of America is divided into four parts, each pa rt concentrating on a different stage in their career. The first part, called The Indi vidual Battle', deals with the early years in Chicago, this is followed by The Federal Battl e', dealing with Canberra. The next part, "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Municipal Battle', deals with Castlecrag, and the final part covers the later years in India. 2 Marion's reminiscences offe r insights into the full range of factors that influenced the initial design, especially th e impact of ancient paradigms and city models. Canberra is the only really modern city in the world. Not that [that] has been made obvious to casual glance, but a structure can only be truly modern when the foundations are properly laid for that particul ar thing, and so it is with Canberra. Its history from the beginning is the history of Town Planning or Land Planning in modern times, say of the past 300 years. For this science (and science is based on knowledge and not on feeling as in the case of the arts) has died out and was no longer practised. 3 Marion's direct reference to a lost science of planning ( i n other words, geomancy) which in fact underpins the Canberra plan s hould be interpreted in relation to other extracts from the Magic of America. Communion with the primeval nature is the common school of thought for future architects, [as] it was in the beginning of civilisation where everywhere in every race and every climate anonymous architects expressed fitness and beauty in their constructions. 4 It is not to the architects that we go to learn architecture now, even in the schools where the cult is taught, but ultimately to the unidentified origin, subconscious peri- ods when art was not in conflict with the surrounding natural world nor a reflex of internal strife. 5 In the Magic of America Marion provides extracts from Walter's writings on architecture and cultural history. In the work of radical architects we find constant resemblance to the work of other men and other people — even Oriental, Aztec, Moorish, Japanese, Greek, Gothic, and Primitive. . . . They glory in the laws of Nature where everything has its purpose and form becomes satisfying only when it be st fits and expresses that function. 6 All the evidence of historical civilisations among men prior to the Romans exhibits] the second essential to arch itecture, subordinat ion to Nature, and indicate[s] some- thing in these civilisations that we lack — a closer relationship of man to nature. 7 With Marion there is a fascination with the ideal of a Golden Age, a notion that is reit- erated in the philosophies of Eastern and Western cultures. 'L ife is a Fine Art' she writes in the Magic of America: That is what all the poets, the seers, the sag es, the revolutionaries have seen in their mind's eye. It was the vision that Moses he ld from the Mount as he passed behind the veil. Life as a fine art [flourished] on the s hores of the Mediterranean Sea in days long before ... in lands where wine and corn a bounded, where song and music and drama "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"made life resplendent, where man surpassed himself and became superman. . . . all this glory that was Greece will be resurrected by the shores of the Pacific. 8 Here, Marion is referring to Castlecrag in Sydney which became a substitute for Canberra — a second chance — following Walte r's resignation from the Canberra pro- ject in 1920. Adulation of the manifold ancient cultu res preceding Rome is a theme which permeates the writing of both Walter and Mari on Griffin. In the original report, which accompanied the competition winning drawings , Walter Burley Griffin had also stated that: Experience from the beginnings of architectur e has demonstrated that the simplest and most formal style has evolved with the comp leted civilisation of each race at its ulti- mate development. Our civilisation is tending that way. 9 It was this kind of thinking that informed certain choices made in the Canberra plan, such as the use of the ziggurat form for th e Capitol building (a monumental structure conceived of as a symbolic , sacred centre of the ci ty). Walter observed that: The stepped pinnacle treatment ... is an expression that was the last word of all the longest lived civilisations here to, whether that be Egypt, Babylonia, Sy ria, India, Indo- China, East Indies, Mexico, Peru. 10 The placing of parliamentary functions literally under Capi tal Hill in Giurgola's new design for Parliame nt House has been severely criticised by many architects. Nevertheless, a correct appreciation of Gi urgola's work should recognise its profound connections to the Griffins' original massing for the Capitol and the principles of Hellenistic city design, to which Marion and Walter were committed. A way of under- standing the true historical perspective of the initial design, and Giurgola's response to it, is through a study of the 1912 original repor t, in which Walter Griffin describes the nucleus of Canberra as a 'theatre'. What he means by this is the Hellenistic theatre, like in the ancient city sites of Pergamon, Lindos, Palestrina, or the Acropolis in Athens. There, in a grand design, by means of terraces, ramps and stairs, images are presented at discrete levels — like the Griffins' pr ojected government group in Canberra, where the panorama of public edifices is crowne d first by the Capitol on Capital Hill and then by an idealised Bimberi Peak. Their adoption of the temple ziggurat form fo r the Capitol building, the nucleus of the compos ition as a symbolic omphalos or cosmic mountain, their use of a scheme of sacred/symbolic geometry, nature mimesis, the quartering of the city, and geomantic axiality and symbolism — all offer evidence that there is much more to the original Canberra plan than is generally acknowledged. The significant influences on the original plan can be gleaned from a careful reading of the Magic of America — in its explanations of the architecture, civic and urban design, and planni ng projects of the Griffins — as well as from ot her writings such as 'Building with Nature'. These influ- ences can be placed in four categories: or igin and symbolism of the city form, with "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"8 SeCKGT pLAM Of CAMDCRR3 L particular reference to the Hellenistic and Chinese city models; ax ial and linear con- structions as representations of the divi ne and the cosmos, wh ich are found in the archaeological remains of ancient cultures; Chinese geomancy or the principle of the five sacred mountains and th e concept of earth energies as embodied in the philosophy of ch'i and feng shui which prescribes relationships be tween constructions, the natural topography and water areas, and, finally, the tradition of crysta l iconography, symbol- ising spiritual transcen dence and transmutation. These are the main themes of this book and through them it will be demon- strated not only that Canberra has evolved within a tradition which originated in antiquity but that it can also be aligned with some of the most powerful symbols of both Eastern and Western culture. From an understanding of these influences the national capital should, therefore, achieve increased significance in the minds of the Australian people, and this heightened awareness may liberate a new and dynamic approach to the future development of the city.

In the past, it has been largely ignored. There are tw o manuscripts: one is held by the New York Historical Society; the other is in the Burnham Library in Chicago. The two differ slightly in organisation and content but they have the common pur pose of documenting the life and work of Walter and Marion Griffin. There is difficulty in determining the referencing of some of the material as the volumes consist of a rather haphazard collection of material, articles, letters and interviews from throughout the Griffins' lives. Often, the work is not dated and her writing style is idiosyncra tic. The numbering system throughout the book is also inconsistent.

But it was the reaction against the prevailing revivalism and eclecticism that generated the most intense influences, some of which were absorbed through an inte rest in the new syncretic religious move- ments that many contemporary artists and architects shared. For outstanding artists such as Vassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Marc Chagall and Paul Klee, for modern architects such as William Lethaby, Antoni o Gaudi, Edwin Lutyens, Hendrik Berlage, Peter Behrens, Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, as well as the Griffins, Theosophy, Swedenborgianism, Rosicrucia nism, Freemasonry and the occult all offered dynamic new alternatives to Christianity. A prof ound influence was exer ted by these newer, syncretic religious movements, whose origins could be tr aced back th rough the her- metic tradition to the Renaissance and to an cient Rome and Greece. And these artists and architects combined elemen ts drawn from these newer beliefs with paganism in their search for a spirituality which could catalyse artistic inspiration from new histori- cal perspectives. In addition, many ancient sites of religious practice were being excavated and documented at the end of the nineteenth century by astro-arch aeologists, who pub- lished their findings in journals such as Archaeologia and Nature. Marion and Walter Griffin had access to these jour nals and clear parallels exist between their work and this published material. For example, the crossed land and water axes of the Canberra plan resemble large me galithic and geomantic constructi ons such as th ose surrounding Haagscher Berg near Munchen Gladbach in northern Germany, or the axial crossings of the Salisbury Plain complex (see figures 3.6 and 3.10). In this latter complex its north-south axis conn ects Salisbury Cathedral, the ancient mound at Old Sarum, the great cosmic temple at Stonehenge, the Av ebury stone circles, Cirencester Church, and extends to Dufton Fell in Westmoreland. Th is same axis also crosses an east-west alignment connecting sacred Glastonbury and Stonehenge, and extending through many sacred and holy hills to Shere near L ondon. Similar to Canberra, too, is the most famous axis of the ancient world: the al ignment connecting the Parthenon with Mount Salamis to the west of Athens and the horns of Mount Hymettos to the east. And when the axis urbis of Rome penetrates to the Alban H ills, six ancient shrines are built on a north-south axis stretc hing from Anzio through Lanuvio, Nemi and Tuscolo to Tivoli, with Monte Cavo being the pinnacl e — the sacred mountain — in the same way that Bimberi Peak was for Canberra in the Griffins' plan. ORIGINS AND SYMBOLISM OF THE CITY FORM In ancient times temples, villages, towns a nd cities were construc ted as entities mod- elled and structured on the nature of the universe. Nigel Pennick points out that 'the city, the fundamental unit of human civilisa tion, has always been a microcosm of its immediate world, containing within its boundaries the hierarchical structure of its soci- ety'. This was a concept which, on a larger scale, also governed the conceptual arrangement of state and country and on a smaller scale, the erection of dwellings. A"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"COSCOOtOGlCAl SYtOBOUSCP 11 Peking is one example of a city which appro ached this ideal. The innermost section of Peking is the Forbidden City: the sacred centre — the 'ritual site upon which the Emperor as the embodiment of the Empire sat'. Surrounding the Forbidden City was the everyday secular city which, in turn, was surrounded by the 'inner civilised states of the Empire'. Beyond this were the provinces, the less civilised states, they, in turn, were protected from the barbarians and chaos by the Great Wall of China. The city and state were unified by this cosmological concept. 1 Although ancient cosmologie s differ in their particular explanations of the world, city form was commonly generated ei ther through direct cosmological symbol- ism or, less formally, from a ritual symbolis ing the creation of the world. Regarding the latter, cosmogonic myths explain the creation of the cosmos thr ough the slaying of a giant, serpent or dragon — the organs of th e creature giving birt h to the va rious parts of the cosmos. In some myths, specific body pa rts and organs of the creature are attrib- uted to the creation of certain plants, huma n species or different social orders. The giant or serpent symbolically represents th e chaos and watery formlessness that existed before creation. The act of slaying represents the emergence of form and the end of chaos. These myths often form the basis to the ritual surrounding building practices. According to traditional practice in India, for example, before masons can begin work, an astronomer shows them a place where they can build. This spot is supposed to lie above the head of the 'snake that supports the world'. Once this spot is determined the master mason takes a sharpened stake and driv es it into the earth in order to fix the snake's head. This ritu al represents the cosm ogonic act of Soma or Indra, when he 'struck the snake in his lair' and his lightning bolt 'cut off its head' (Rigveda IV, 17,9 & I, 52,10). Such myths have also led to the practice of build ing and city sa crifices. As Mircea Eliade points out, if a city {temple, dwelling) is to endure it 'must be animated, that is, it must receive a life and soul. The tr ansferral of the soul is only possible via a blood sacrifice'. 2 When city form is generated symbolicall y, it is placed conceptually at the cen- tre of the cosmos. In Roman times, as part of the process of establishing the site of a town, the augur first determined if the auspices of the site were favourable. The rela- tionship between surrounding hills and mountains, and water areas, as well as natural phenomena, would aid this determination. The augur then made a ritual delineation of the macroscopic or world templum taking the visible horizon as the circular boundary of the earth and indicating the fo ur corners of the earth corres ponding to the four cardi- nal directions. The augur seems to have establishe d the four cardinal directions with the aid of t he gnomon (or shadow stick), a very ancient technique, also used in the East. It involved the erection of a vertical post and the plotting of the cast shadow, to iden- tify the east-west passage of the sun across the sky. The shadow line thus established became the decumanus or principal east-west street of the town. This line was then bisected at right angles to form the cardo, the principal north-sout h street of the town. The intersection of these two pr incipal streets was called the axis mundi (world axle) — the sacred place at the centre of the tow n, where the founder was usually buried, along with soil or other sacred relics from the parent city. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"12  secKer  P L A . N OP CAMBSKKA Within a circle of c onsecrated space (the Pomoerium), which defined the bound- aries of the urban precinct, th e four-square plan of the town was laid out and its princi- pal quarters were divided by the cardo and decumanus. In the central mundus or microcos- mic world was erected the templum (temple), which was formed by an analogous proce- dure of circular consecration within which a cardinally oriented four-square house was dedicated to the gods or presiding deity of the city. This trad ition is re membered at St Peter's Basilica in Rome, where the ax es of the original Greek cross are located directly over the grave of St Peter. The fo rmative rationale behi nd this procedure was the act of consecration, or cu tting off: in other words, the creation of the human cos- mos — that is, the microcosm of the urba n precinct — protected by the magic circle. Beyond the circle, in the unconsecrated or profane spa ce outside the city walls, lay chaos and disorder. The cutting off involved, too, the creation of the temenos (sacred space), which was delineated by the ritual act of ploughing the perimeter of the consecrated area in a circle centred on the axis mundi. Precisely the sa me process of consecration, or cutting off of sacred space, is imp licit in the notion of the templum ; being traditionally located at the town centre, it was conceived of as a replication in miniature and its four-square, ca rdinally oriented building as imago mundi (a map or image of the world). Mircea Eliade attributes the universality of the quartering system to a common perception or 'system of the world'. That is, the sacred place constitutes a break in the homogeneity of space a nd this break is symbolised by an opening which enables pas- sage from one cosmic region to another. Th us, there is a connec tion between heaven, the earth and the underworld: the axis mundi. Around this cosmic axis, symbolised by a tree, sacred pillar or stone, or a temple, lies the world,- hence, the axis is located 'in the middle' at the 'navel of the earth'. In Chin a the ancient science of geomancy, based in cosmological symbolism, ordered the entire country around the five sacred mountains: the cosmic mountain at the centre with the other four at the cardinal points. The Egyptian hieroglyph meaning city or to wn is a circle quartered. The Roman mundus, paradigm for human habitati on, was a circular trench divided into four parts. 3 The modelling of the ideal city on cosmological paradigms allowed ancient man to locate himself within the order of the universe. To Plato, quartering allowed for the perfect balance between order and freedom, and this is illustrated in his concept of the ideal city: Magnesia approached this ideal (the true ideal is always unmanifested form). His concept of the ideal city was informed by the ancient 'wisdom tradition' which Plato himself had sought in knowle dge held by the Egyptians. THE GEOMETRY OF THE VESICA At the turn of the century it was the ne w syncretic religious movements such as Theosophy that drew on the ancient 'wisdom tradition'. With Th eosophy this tradition"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"was drawn into the mainstream of contemporary artistic and intellectual life. Such a tradition had the power to direct its follow ers towards a new inner awareness, as a result of which in their work they were able to take the cosmos into account and depict the world as an abstraction of a majest ic play of energies. The importance of Th eosophic though t to the work of the Griffins becomes clear as early as 1912, from the geometry of the design for the federal capital of Australia. The geometry of th e Canberra plan, based on th e figure of the Vesica, acts as a symbolic reinterpretati on of one of the most fundame ntal precepts of Theosophic thought: Cosmic Evolution — a perpetual cycle of birth, death and regeneration as underlying the processes of th e universe. The Vesica descri bed in the Introduction, is the orifice created from the intersection of tw o equal circles, symbolically representing the intersection of the spiritual and material worlds. The concept of Cosmic Evolution is cl early demonstrated by a co-founder of the Theosophy movement, Mada me Helena Blavatsky, in his Unveiled (1875). Two geo- metrical diagrams of Chaldean and Hindu cosmologies are presented and explained by Blavatsky to provide an alternative to the Christian story of creation as a means of explaining the structure of the world (figure 2.2). These cosmologies, unlike the Christian creation story, provide an explanation 'which agrees in every respect with the Evolutionary theory of Modern Science', acco rding to Blavatsky.' The diagrams encap- sulate the geometry of the Canberra plan,- th ey also display a structure which is com- mon to the plans of sacred geomantic constr uctions at Stonehenge and Glastonbury, in the ideal cities of Plato, and the New Je rusalem as conjectured by John Michell in The Dimensions of Paradise. 5 The nucleus of the Canberra design is a system of forms generated from the sacred figure of the Vesica; in this design th e radii of the intersecting circles are deter- mined by the distance between City Hill and the Municipal centre on Mount Pleasant (see figure 1.1). Within the Vesica there emerges two equ ilateral triangle s which share a common base (the Municipal Axis). The triangle with the apex upwards is defined by the natural landscape feat ures of City Hill, Capital Hill and Mount Pleasant, while the downward-facing equilateral tr iangle is marked in the landscape by Mount Ainslie. The Vesica also controls the geometry of the Ca pital Hill design in the initial plan (figure 2.1). The site subdivisions for the Capitol, the governor-general's residence and the prime minister's residence are formed by the interpenetration of three equal circles, the manifestation of a double Vesica. From the interpenetration of the circles, which liber- ates the square and the equilateral triangle , the Vesica also creates a number of other geometrical forms such as the rectangle, the hexagon and the oc tagon — all of which are present in the Canberra design. The rect angle, for instance, determines the centres of the formal water basins, which are projec tions from the Municipal Axis, flanking the parliamentary triangle. Thus, the geometry derived from the Ve sica and its correlation to both natural and built key features of the design provi de an overarching c oncept for Canberra, which is consistent with comments by Walter Burley Griffin: "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"in Town Planning, as in arch itecture, there must be a scheme that the mind can grasp, and it must be expressed in th e simplest terms possible. . . . Just as music depends on simple mathematical relations so do architecture and town planning. 6 The sanctity of the Vesica lies in its ability to give rise to geomet rical figures such as the rhombus, the Star of David or the hexagr am. Thus, within ancient and esoteric tra- ditions, it became a symbol of perceived knowledge and perpetual attention. 7 In the Chaldean and Hindu images the circle, whic h is fundamental to the construction of the Vesica, enshrines the geom etrical figure of the double tr iangle, replicating the Star of David. As defined by Blavat sky, the circle symbolises the spiritual origins of the uni- verse, the world within the universe, and th e spiritual essence from which springs all creation. In explaining the symbolic importance of these cosmological and geometrical diagrams, she describes the theosophical conc ept of the active and passive relationship of spirit and matter in the universe. With reference to the two equilateral triangles facing upwards and downwards, she writes: the triangle played a prominen t part in the religious syst em of every great nation, for everywhere it represented th e three great principles — th e spirit-force and matter, or Figure 2.2 The World within the Universe and Manifested Logos, from Isis Unveiled by Helena Blavatsky"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"16 S6CR6T PL3.N Of CANBCRRA. the active (male), passive (female) and the co rrelative principle whic h partakes of both and binds the two together. 8 and she goes on to say: The double triangle belongs to one of the most important, if it is not in itself the most important, of the mystic figures in India. It is the emblem of the Trimurti , three in one. The Triangle with its apex upwards indicates the male principle, downward the female; the two typifying at th e same time sp irit and matter. 9 When the two triangles interp enetrate, as in the Chalde an and Hindu diagrams, and the Star of David, it is said that the 'dispara te elements of the universe are reintegrated into the Primordial whole'. 10 They are 'brought together by the uniting principle of production', that is, the divi ne influences underlying th e processes of evolution.\" In the Canberra plan Marion and Walter Griffin unite the tr iangles, upwards and downwards, on a common base within the orifice of the Vesica rather than form- ing the hexagram or the Star of David. The Vesica controls the geometry of Canberra both in the overall concept a nd in the structure of Capital Hill. The double triangle within the Vesica can be interpreted as a symbolic restructuring of both Western and Eastern cosmogonies; a clear parallel, not only with the Chaldean and Hindu geome- try, but also with that of Stonehenge, Glastonbury and th e conjectural New Jerusalem — 'the world within the universe'. To the Gri ffins the Vesica clearly represents the true geometrical symbol of the Th eosophical idea of the metaphysical stat e of the spirit, 'the womb of the universe', from which a ll processes evolve. And the double triangle is the central figure in a cosmological diagram which represents the mystical progression from matter (downward triangle) through to spirit (upward triangle) as motivated by the spiritual essence of the universe. AXIAL CONSTRUCTIONS SYMBOLISING THE COSMOS The incorporation of specific axial constructions in the initial Canberra design contin- ues the theme of cosmological symbolis m and provides connections between the Griffins' use of sacred geomet ry and their interest in th e city forms of the ancient world. On the Canberra plan the top of Black Mo untain is marked A; AB is the Water Axis, where B is a monument in Lake Park set against a circul ar road or landscape ele- ment. Thus, the sign of the cross is made over Canberra, ABCD, wh ere C is the peak of Mount Ainslie and D is Bimb eri Peak, which is clearly labelled on the plan and in the original report diagrams as the terminus to the Land Axis. The Land Axis, there- fore, connects Mount Ainslie, the Casino (now the War Memorial) and the Parkway, and extends through the formal basins to connect the Government Group — the judi- ciary, the executive and the parliament — with the Capi tol, Red Hill and, finally, Bimberi Peak, which is situated some 25 kilo metres to the south of Capital Hill (see figure 2.3). "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"18 SeCKCT ptAW OP C&NB6RRX To Marion, Bimberi seems to be a sacred mountain akin to Mount Olympus in Greece or Monte Cavo in Italy. When Bimber i Peak is added to the entire axial net- work emanating from the parliamentary equila teral triangle — the Capitol, City Hill and the markets/station/cathedral nodes being the salient points, its axes extending to Mugga Mugga, along Northbourne Avenue a nd incorporating the land and water axes — the plan is of a size quite beyond any comparable City Beautiful or Garden City construction. Certainly, the orie ntation of the land and the water axes to the landscape (hills and mountains) and the outward looking character of the pla n, with the inclusion of Bimberi Peak into the plan's composition and its great distance from the city centre — all make it difficult to expl ain the design simply in term s of the City Beautiful and the Garden City. The geometrical infrastructu re generated from this patterning is also more intricate and more rele vant to the natura l topography than typical aesthetic arrangements of th e City Beautiful. In 'Mondrian and Theosophy', Robert Welsh notes that the cross, like the tri- angle, 'expresses a single mysti cal concept of life and immorta lity'. It is another symbol for the mystical progression within th e Theosophical concept of evolution. 12 The four points of the cross represent, in succession, birth, life, death and immortality. The sign of the cross over Canberra, the ABCD move ment, clearly derives from Theosophical symbolism as it is defined by Helena Blavat sky in her discussion on the Chaldean and Hindu imagery. The vertical line being the male principle and the horizontal the female, out of the union of the two at the intersection point is formed the CROSS.\" This point of intersection in the Canberra in itial plan is marked by the Water Gate as the nucleus of the composition. Naming the axes 'Land' and 'Water parallels the juxta- position of Earth and Water in the Chaldean and Hindu cosmologi cal diagrams, indi- cating that the Griffi ns were familiar with Theosoph ical dogma. Blavatsky describes the deeper significance of the cross as follows: The Philosophical cross, the two lines running in opposite directions, the horizontal and the perpendicular, the height and th e breadth, which the geometrizing deity divides at the intersecting point, and which fo rms the magical as well as the scientific quaternary, when inscribed within the perfec t square, is the basis of the occultist. Within its mystical precinct lies the master key which opens the door of every science, physical as well as spiritual. It symbolises our human existenc e, for the circle of life cir- cumscribes the four points of the cross, . . . Everything in this world is a Trinity com- pleted by the quaternary, and every el ement is divisible in this principle. 14 For the parliamentary triangle Walter and Mari on Griffin adopted a plan based on geo- mantic and Hellenistic principles, which used Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, Mugga Mugga, Bimberi Peak, and the lesser forms of Mount Pleasant, Ca pital Hill and City Hill to provide its geometri c organisation. In the past socio-political idealism and democratic symbolic intent, ra ther than the site characteri stics, have been singled out as the essential organising principles of th e Canberra plan. Such explanations are gen-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"erally reductive, however, since they fail to recognise that the Griffins' concept of democracy is tied to ancient Greek relig ious symbolism as related to landscape. 15 In every respect the initial design directs the eye to wards these mountains and hills. The government group is organised on frontages and terraces in a horizontal order and a vertical hierarchy which culminat es in the Capitol, the apex of the lower parliamentary equilateral tria ngle, and which locks the design into the land and water axes (see figure 2.4). In the original repor t which accompanied the competition draw- ings, Walter Griffin described the structure of the parliamentary triangle — the gov- ernment group and the northern parkland beyo nd the formal basin — as analogous to a theatre. The background first mentione d above and visible primarily from the Northerly por- tion of the central district of the City is us ed to set off the governmental group, for which it serves as a stage sett ing, as it were, from the clos est adjacent flat lands of the opposite side of the basin used by the Public Gardens, a 'parquet' for this theatrical whole and from the commercial portion of the city, next beyond and above occupying the 'dress circle'. 16 It is clear from the use of the site that the Griffins' use of th e terms 'theatre' and 'amphitheatre' can be taken as referring to a Hellenistic theatre and temple complex, the organising principle of which is dem onstrated at sites such as Delphi, the Acropolis, Pergamon, Lindos, Palestrina and Tivoli. Why did the Griffins adopt the Hellenistic model? The Magic of America reveals that Marion saw the ancient Creeks as a race of 'creative thinkers', and from creative thinking democracy could arise. Creative thinking goes direct to totalities a nd works from wholes to particulars. The Greeks conceived the totality of nature — earth, water, air and fire its four conditions of matter . . . the Greeks expressed their insp iration in the fourness of their temples.\" Marion, who drew all th e work for the initial plan, saw her task as intr oducing liberty to the world. Marion saw liberty as the func tion of individualistic, creative and produc- tive cultural activit y, which in Canberra is enshrined in the concept of the Capitol. Equality (the function of a de mocratic political or ganisation), fratern ity (the function of a cooperative mercantile centre), and liberty were unified in Canberra in a triangular concept. The equilateral triangle, derived from the principles of sacred geometry, is a rich source, therefore, of arcane symbolism: it represents the Holy Trinity in Christian iconography and is the symbol of godhead in several cosmologies; 18 to the Griffins it may also be taken as expre ssive of democracy in symbo lic terms — libe rty, equality and fraternity. CHINESE GEOMANCY Another category of influences upon the prep aration of the initial plan for Canberra was one emanating from the East — ch'i and feng shui. The concept of ch'i appealed to"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"COSCDO L OQICA I SVCOBO L ISCD  21 Marion and Walter as it formed the basis to an ancient art of landscape design which stressed good health and fortune. Before the Canberra proj ect, Marion had already ac quired a knowledge of Taoist philosophy as well as experience in Eastern artistic principles through the impact of the Japanese print on the Chicago school of architects. In Chinese landscape painting the artist was not c oncerned with the external phy sical form of an object but rather its 'ch'i', its inner, spiritual side. Ch'i, which can be translated as 'the breath of life', is the cosmic energy and life force that infuses all forms and, as such, underlies the Taoist philosophy of landscape design, feng shui. The primary role of a feng shut master is to recognise the flow of ch'i in and across the landscap e and manipulate it for his client's benefit — for good fortune and heal th. This manipulation is determined by a number of practices based on geomantic prin ciples such as the placement of a building within certain natural format ions — rivers, seas and mount ains — and the orientation of the building in relation to other nearby constructions. 19 There are a number of distinct features that characterise the ideal site, accord- ing to feng shui principles (see chapter 4). In the in itial plan for Canberra, there is a striking parallel to these principles. The foci of the design, the Capitol and the govern- ment group, are sited in rela tion to a secondary hill (Kur rajong or Capital Hill), which is sheltered by a high mountain range to the south (Bimberi Peak in the Brindabellas). Black Mountain (the azure dragon), to th e west, and Mugga Mugg a (the white tiger), to the east, can be symbolised as the manifest ations of the earth's spirits. As in the ideal fen g shui landscape — man in harmony with the earth — there is an unobstructed view from the Capitol towards Mount Ainslie in the north, and th ere is a quiet Heaven Pool (in the foreground of the Griffins' Parliame nt House), with a curving and slow-moving body of water in the distance (the formal and irregular basins). CRYSTAL ICONOGRAPHY Crystal iconography, symbolising spiritual tr anscendence and tran smutation, is a fur- ther major influence and emerges as a domin ant feature of both the architectural pro- posals for Canberra and the draw ings themselves. This use of the crystal form can be seen as a continuation of a tradition ste mming from ancient Solo monic legends, St John's revelation of the New Je rusalem, Islamic ar chitecture, the lege nds of the Holy Grail, the gothic cathedral and light mystic ism, and the emergence of alchemy. It was an iconographic tradition that stressed the transparent, luminous qualities of crystal and glass and water, which had the ability to effect a transm utation of the viewer from a base condition of existence to a more noble and spiritual state. By the turn of the twentieth century the crystal had become a clearly recognisable symbol for spiritual transmutation either on an individu al scale or for a whole society. Marion makes references to the crysta l form and crystal iconography in the Magic of America. The Fairies build the vegetable kingdom but it takes the great primal spirits of mathe- matics to create the crystals — the Universe. 20 "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"In the City and Environs drawing each mo untain is shrouded in a luminous, iridescent, white and yellow aura that radiates like a crystal. This luminos ity and brightness is echoed in the other natural aspects of the plan: the formal and irregular basins of the dammed Molonglo River. The 'crystalline' aura of the landforms and of the architecture is reinforced by the strong emphasis on th e shimmering reflections in Marion's Canberra drawings (see figures 2.5 and 4.3). The character of Marion's work is labelled by Paul Larson as a 'socia lised nature mysticism'. 21 Marion may have been aware of the crystal iconography begi nning to appear in the work of the German Expressionist architects. In their work and in that of the Griffins' mentor, L ouis Sullivan, glass and ornament became a light-splintering medium which allowed the observer to transcend the restrictions of the physical domain an d enter a spiritual co mmunion with nature and the forces that shape it. 22 THE GRIFFINS' LEGACY What we have now at the centre of Canberra is the legacy of an attempt to reinstate the science which 'had died out and was no longer practis ed', combined with pic- turesque settings as devised by the Natio nal Capital Development Commission from 1958.

The axial vistas of baroque city planning regulate the City Beautiful move ment and in its rhet oric it was concerne d with civic design rather than social functions. 1 The City Beautiful movement advocated aesthetic archi- tectural planning with a gr ound composition of monumental buildings, grand piazzas, and sweeping vistas connecting extensive park land to the civic centre. The initial plan for Canberra had responded to this principle within the parliamentary triangle. But the overarching concept of the plan, derived fr om ancient geomantic models, incorporated axial and linear constructions which focu ssed on hills and mountains paralleling ancient symbolic representati ons of the divine and the cosmos. Thus , in its structure and size, the initial plan ha s a character that resembles many of the geomantic axial and linear constructions from the ancient worl d in Europe and the N ear East, as well as in the Americas. These sites have been re vealed and documented since the later nine- teenth century through astro-archaeology, a discipline that has been aided more recently by the techniques of aerial photography. Canberra, in common with other Garden City constructions of the time, was intended to provide an ideal surround for a healthy and contented population. It is clear, however, that the Griffins' objectives went beyond these basic concerns and that their plan's prime source of inspiration wa s the culture of the ancient world. Marion and Walter Griffin sought to revive the no tion of the 'Golden Age' — a myth common to all ancient cultures, which was thought to influence all facets of life and religion. The Magic oj America reveals how, in their early attempts to establish a new profession of landscape architecture, th e unification of architect ure and town planning, the Griffins sought inspiration and justification from ancien t systems of planning embod- ied in both Eastern and Western geomancy. By adopting such ancient paradigms they infused the Canberra plan with a similar sacr ed and divine organisation to that which underlies the physical structures of great citi es of the world such as Athens and Rome, and is also implicit in th e most significant monumental constructions of the ancient world. The capital of Australia, therefore, mu st be interpreted and re-evaluated within a planning tradition that reaches back to the origins of cities. AXIAL CONSTRUCTIONS IN THE ANCIENT WORLD The concept of quadrata is implicit in the Canberra structure as a result of its land-water axial intersection. Quadrata is the quartering of the city by the cardo—decumanus system, which is manifest in Roma Quadrate and is remembered nowa- days in such expressions as the 'Latin Quarter' of Paris. In ancient planning the term omphalos ('navel') was applied to any divined ge omantic centre. The concept originated from the omphalos at Delphi, seat of the oracle of Apollo and centre of the Greek world (figure 3.1). The omphalos, which is the cardo-decumanus crossing, fixes the axis mundi, the connection between the heavens and the earth. As a pivot around which everything T"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" along the cardo or Land Axis, while a sec- ondary decumanus or cross-axis creates the location of the Senate chamber and the House of Representatives chamber. This creates in the new Parliament House a micro- cosm of the urban precinct at the city centre. The concept of Canberra as caput mundi is reinforced by the naming of the avenues which radiate from Capital Hill: Sydney, Melbourne, Perth. In Athens the Creeks se t up temples on the Acropolis (the Parthenon, the Erechtheion, Athena Nike) in such a way that the landscape wa s drawn around them — landscape and temples, together, being gathered into a composition. In his Vers une Architecture (1923) Le Corbusier said of the Parthenon , This creates a fact as reasonable to our understanding as the fact \"sea\" or the fact \"m ountain\"'. The axis of the Acropolis, which runs from the sea to the mo untain, is the most famous geomantic axis of the ancient world.' The cardo-decumanus intersection is dominant , the main axis link- ing Mount Saiamis in the west with the cent ral axis of the Propylaea, the statue of Athena, the site of the old temple of Athe na and the horns of Mount Hymettos in the distance (figure 3.2). From nor th to south a secondary axis links the sacred horns of Mount Deceleia with Poseidon's porch on the northern end of th e Erechtheion, and continues through the altar of Athena to the northern co rner of the Parthenon and then beyond, leading the eye away to the distant sea. 4 The axis is, thus, determined by these distant landscape forms. In Rome, too, divine and cosmic concepts are implicit in its structure. The axis urbis of antiquity, running along the via sacra and through the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, was strengthened and enriched when the Colosseum was built exactly on the axis in th e sacred valley be tween the hills (figure 3-3). It was further reinforced when the temple of Venu s and Rome was similarl y located; thus its two cellae (sanctuar-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" ies), placed back-to-back in the temple, stood Janus-like — facing both directions taken by the axis in a symbolic ex pression of the role of Rome as caput mundi. The axis urbis was, moreover, extended to the other side of the Tiber by th e construction of a circus, carefully placed in relation to an ancient burial ground and shrine — and today the site of the Vatican. Cons tantine transformed Rome symbolically into a Christian city by locating the two main churches on the axis urbis-. the church of the Saviour, St John in the Lateran, to the south and St Peter's in the north. Later, the sign of the cross was put over the entire city by means of a symbolic decumanus added between the churches of St Paul and St Mary (Santa Maria Maggiore), and us ing the Colosseum at the centre to unify anthropometric orders an d cosmic axes in the simplest possible way. This cross-axial form acted as a precu rsor for the development of many European cities. 1 As Christian Norburg-Schulz points out in his 'Genius Loci of Rome', it is not surprising that the extension of the axis urbis leads to the Alban Hills, where the gods of antiquity were at home (some 25 kilo metres from the man-ma de synthesis of the city). 6 Being the remnants of an old volcano, the Alban Hilts have a simple shape and their clear topographic features are emphasis ed by two almost circular lakes in the deep craters. The hills rise up to form an impressive mass over the everyday world and possess that basic property of the classical la ndscape: a distinct and easily imaginable relationship between masses and spaces. The ma in sanctuaries of Latium were located here, lined up on a north-south ax is. On the top of Monte Cavo (Albanus Mons ), Jupiter Latiaris presided over the whole region. There, the forty-seven memb ers of the Latin Confederation celebrated the Feriae Latinae every spring. Diana reig ned in the woods on the slope of the mountain, her sacred gr ove being mirrored in the calm and deep waters of Lago de Nemi; on the othe r side of the la ke, in Lanuvio (Lanuvium), where the slope is cultivated and less steep, Juno had her temple. Continued to the so uth, the sacred axis reaches Anzio (Antium), where there was a temple dedicated to Fortuna (figure 3.4). Towards the north, the same axis passes through Tuscolo (Tusculum), where Castor and Pollux were at home, and then reaches"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" Ttvoli, where Hercules ruled over a wilder kind of environment, and there were also temples to Sibilla and Vesta. The main sanctuaries of Latium, thus, formed a natural north-south cardo, about which the cosmos revolved; and the sun followed the natural decumanus of the Secco Valley and the axis urbis of the city, which connected the Roman Campagna with Campania Felix. In the initial design for Canberra, Marion and Walter Griffin depicted a con- struction which parallels the heroic propor tions of the geomantic constructions in Athens and Rome. The Land Axis connects Mount Ainslie with the Capitol and Red Hill,- and then as the City and Environs draw ing clearly indicates, this axis continues to Bimberi Peak in the Brindabella ranges to the south. The prairie-like undulations of the Molonglo Valley, which greatly appealed to the Griffins, form a natural decumanus akin to that of the Roman Campagna and this is reinforced by both the Water Axis and the Municipal Axis- Together, these focus upon Black Mountain (see figure 3.5). This cardo-decumanus scheme is also present in Latium at Palestrina, where a great composi- tion of axially disposed terraces reinforces the decumanus of the Secco Va lley while the axis emanating from the temple of Fo rtuna at Palestrina functions as a cardo which leads the eye between the Alban Hills and the Lepine Hills towards the distant sea. 7 In Egypt there is evidence of a geomantic construction of even greater size.

It appears everywhere in both the Old and the New World in tra- ditional and rediscovered sacr ed images and calendars, whic h have always relied upon the same laws of correspondence between the cycles of earth and heaven. 9 These observations of Dr Josef Heinsch il luminate the philosophi cal stance of Marion and Walter Griffin and those of their contemporaries who were interested in the reju- venation of ancient paradigms. For the ancients, all human thoughts and actions were subordinated to the energising influence of the all-powerful divine forces, everything mundane being bound up with the divine. Th eir philosophy and wisdom culminated in the knowledge that 'as above, so below',- thus, they attempted to bring all their activi- ties and ambitions into harmony with higher nature, the divine will. Geomantic constructions an d axial alignments in th e ancient world were not restricted to the cardo-decumanus scheme; many early examples exist of interconnecting alignments that form complex geometrical forms linking both constructed and natural "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"A eeocr>ANTic moOel. 3 3 elements. Recent studies have indicated that certain geometrical pa tterns in the land- scape can be linked with the 'ancient geometer's im age of the ideal cosmology'. 10 Far back in prehistoric times, probably when agricultural settlements were first developing, land was already being accurately divided and surveyed -— such ancient geometrical arrangement apparently being carried out over wide tracts of la nd, and not just small areas. In the East as well as in northern Europe, this was done according to certain fixed angles measured from th e astronomical north-south axis and using universal mea- sures of length. There are metr ological principles in land scape patterns which corre- spond to angle, le ngth and number. These proportions were later retain ed in northern European stone circles and canonically constr ucted sacred buildings and temples in the East as well as Christian churches, and are e ffective today in giving these constructions a cosmic-sacred quality. Apart from the fundamental triangulati on of the country based on 30° and 60°, and the orientations on the di agonal of a square (45°), or double square (about 26.5°), the main sacred angles determining the an cient geometrical arrangement of the land- scape relate to a basi c meridian. This base-line links two important sacred sites which are found to occur regularly: the holy hill in th e west, originally associated chiefly with moon worship and in Christian times often dedicated to the Virgin; and to the east of this on 84° or 96° — with a 6° deviation to the no rth or south — the former solar site, in Christian times often dedicated to St John the Baptist. In the mathematics of the ancients this base-line, with the angle of 6°, appears in a right-angled triangle with short sides in the ratio 19:2; the square on the hypotenuse being 365 ( I 9 2 + 2 2 ). This base-line was named the sola r year-line (figure 3.9). 11 The sacred art of metrology, the magical view of microcosmic-macrocosmic correspondences which was based on the ancients ' clear insight into nature, originally covered all sites of any importance — sacrific ial and assembly places, in particular, as well as boundary mark s. Allowing for the varying impor tance and purpose of individ- ual sites, universally valid rules governed th eir orientations to on e another, starting throughout from the north-south axis or cardo. The general conservative practice of retaining holy hills in addition to pagan religious site s as the chief sacred centres and their subsequent occu pation by churches, chapels and mo sques to identify them with Christianity or Islam, creates a recognisable pattern today that endows the structure of a country or landscape with a characteris tic local stamp. Josef Heinsch has demon- strated the principles of th is universal geomet rical structure whic h underlies many ancient settlements in northern Europe: for instance, Odry in Czechoslavakia, the regions surrounding Chartres in France, Kleve in Germany, and Stonehenge and Salisbury Plain in England. In the initial plan for Canberra the Griffins drew into the geometrical compo- sition a number of hills apart from those comprising the fundamental central composi- tion within the structure of the Vesica: M ount Pleasant, Mugga Mugga, and numerous nodal points, the centres of polygonal suburban street patterns, extending from the tri- angular matrix such as Northbourne Avenue to the north betwee n Mount Ainslie and Black Mountain, or emanating from Capital Hill. Taken as a totality, this composition "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"a. qeocDAWTic cnoOel. 35 bears a striking resemblance to structures following the prin ciples of sacred geometry outlined by Josef Heinsch. In 1911, when Marion a nd Walter Griffin were preparing the drawings for Canberra, a large body of work on the axial orientation of Egyptian and Greek tem- ples, and the megalithic monuments of Britain and Europe had rece ntly been published by scientists C W Penrose, J Gr iffith and Sir Norman Lockyer. 12 Lockyer and his con- temporaries proposed that Egyptian and Greek temples were axially aligned in accor- dance with the solstices or equinoxes of the sun, the rising and se tting of the moon or a particular star, or even the date of the de dication of the temple to a particular deity. Connections were also seen between this tr adition of temple co nstruction and mega- lithic constructions in Britain. Thus, from 1890, and building on the work of William Stukely and John Wood, Lockyer began studying the megalithic monuments of ancient Britain. 13 In articles in Nature (from 1890 to 1910), and in his book Stonehenge and other British Monuments Astronomically Considered ( 1906), Lockyer revealed the astrological and geological influences governing the selection of sites and the principles of construction of these monuments. 14 His work focussed on their orie ntation and thei r alignments with natural landforms, man-made outliers and avenues, and markers. At the same time, temples at Lan uvio, Tivoli and Ne mi were being excavate d by British and Italian archaeologists, who documented their findings in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries, the Proceedings of the Royal Society and in the journal Arcbaeologia from 1895.\" The Griffins may not have read the prof essional archaeological journals but they probably did know Nature; for it was an international journal containing, in addi- tion to material on the natural sciences, articles on art an d architecture. At the time of the Canberra plan it is very likely that both Walter, an advocate of design in harmony with nature, and Marion, who was influenced by mysticism, spirituality and nature worship, were already familiar with Lockyer's work, as well as his discourse on the attendant beliefs and customs of the societies that produced these constructions. Stonehenge is the solar centre, the great cosmic temple, which lies on the solar year-line extending ove r the Salisbury region (figur e 3.10). The entire geometri- cal scheme incorporating sacr ed sites, holy hills and pr ehistoric villages and towns extends to Glastonbury. There, a system of axes connects St Benedict's, the Market Cross, St John's Church and Wells Cath edral, while another axis runs over St Benedict's, along the axis of the town, th rough the axis of the abbey church, down Dod Lane to Gore Hill in Wiltshire and thro ugh to Stonehenge, fr om where it contin- ues to Bury Fort, Pu ttenham Common Hill and Shere Church. These axes were not simply sight lines but functi oned as processional ways ma rked by standing stones often in association with barrows or burial chambe rs, all visible from the sacred hills and mountains across the landscape. 16 Lockyer's work on the astr onomical and religious sign ificance of Stonehenge (as described and illustrated in Nature, in 1905 and 1907), in particular, seems to have been used as a model for the parliament ary triangle and Capital Hill structure of Canberra. 17 At the centre of the Salisbury Plain co mplex of axes Stonehenge is connected to the sacred forest at Grovely by a meridi an (previously described) which is also the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" temple of Stonehenge marked the crossing of an extensive and monumental north-south cardo and a decumanus connecting Glastonbury in the west with Sher e and Hackhurst Down in the east. 19 The parallels with Canberra are uncanny. Capital Hill, City Hill and the Lake Park monument in Canberra are linked, just like Stonehenge, Grovely Castle and Old Sarum, by means of an equilateral tria ngle. The continuation of the axis from Stonehenge through Old Sarum to Clearbury Ring is paralle led by the Capital Hill to City Hill meridian continue d along Northbourne Av enue (see figure 3.5). In addition, the nodal point at Salisbury, the double ring of Stonehenge (figure 3.12), could be taken as the model for the do uble-ringed geometry of Cap ital Hill. While it is clear that the initial plan for Canberra was infl uenced by mainstream Theosophical ideas, it is reasonable to suggest that it was the work of Norman Lockyer that crystallised the Canberra geometry. 20 The Vesica, which is the crucial element of the Canberra plan, is fundamental to the geometry of Stonehenge and of Glastonbury, next to Stonehenge the earliest and most sacred site in megalithic Britain and, later, the site of the first Christian church. Norman Lockyer's articles in Nature on the axial alignments of British mega- lithic monuments could also have influenced other aspe cts of the initial Canberra plan. 21 The practice he de scribes of marking specific ho ly hills and solar sanctuaries with large stones or slabs be ars a direct resemblance with the way that the Griffins designed and located a number of their s uggested architectural forms, such as the Casino and the Capitol. The twin towe rs of the Casino (see figure 2.5), which immediately direct the eye to the peak of Mount Ainslie, especially bring to mind"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" metric figure. 22 The expression of ancient paradigms and an idiosyncratic cosmological symbolism are clearly pr ime objectives for the Griffins but they are not the only fac- tors contributing to the final design and it is necessary to understand what other forces were at work on them and their colleagues at the time. THE NEW PROFESSION OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE In attempting to establish the new profession of landscape architecture, Walter Burley Griffin, like the majority of his radical cont emporaries, rejected th e eclecticism of the Beaux Arts schools. He sought the integration of architec ture and land-planning on a grand scale. In their writings the Griffins accentuate the historical periods which were characterised by 'creative th inking': notably, ancient Gree ce and the medieval Gothic period. Marion, in particul ar, attributes creative thinking to the true radicals of the twentieth century, Lo uis Sullivan and Walte r himself. In the Magic oj America she writes: Mr Griffin, Mr Sullivan's succ essor in creative thinking in these fields awakened the community to the necessi ty of considering simultaneously the problem of building and environment near and far. It now becomes cl ear that these cannot be practised as sepa- rate professions, architect or town planne r, but only as one indivisible profession — Landscape Architecture.\" Disregarding dry-cut, analytical interpre tations of the ancien t world, the Griffins focussed in their quest on the magic ritual and wonder conjured up by new interpreta- tions of Eastern and Western traditions. In a new profession of landscape architecture sincerity and invention w ould replace 'decadence, im itation and ostentation'. 24 Past civilisations in possession of advanced astronomical and geodetic knowledge funda- mental to all facets of life could be exem plars, showing ways to overcome the socio- logical problems and ills generated by the in dustrialised and materialistic twentieth "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"x qeocoANTic cooOeL 39 century. Norman Lockyer's descriptions of the ancient world, while centring on the astronomical significance of the great monuments, dwelt upon their importance as sacred centres of nature worship too. 25 Both Marion and Walter regarded the 'historic civilisations prior to the Roma ns' as correctly relating 'man to nature', and they held that there was also a legacy from ancien t planning realised in more recent times; Japanese roads, all in cutting do no violence to the topography. Feudal castles appear to grow out of the jagged ro cks of Europe. The mud houses of the African deserts and the Pueblo Indians in America are distinctly part and parcel of a homogeneous nature as is the Eskimo igloo, an d these certainly represent mo re scientific, economic and comfortable housing under the conditions th an do our houses constructed now after 2000 years to the specifications of Vitruvius. 26 The Griffins were not alone in their fasc ination for the geoman tic tradition and its potential in modern land-pla nning; it had become the subj ect of debate on the other side of the Atlantic. The biologist, soci ologist, and town-pla nner, Patrick Geddes, stressed the importance of the recognition of cu ltural history as a tool for the develop- ment of planning in the future. For Geddes, a higher evolutionary goal, a greater stage in human development, would cu re the maladies of the mode rn city. And the best pro- cedure for studying the city, in order to achie ve this, was to produ ce a regional survey — a study of its geographical location and the history of the evolution of its cultural traditions, which he labelled 'civics'. Geddes advocated that, from an understanding of the deeper past, the planners of the pres ent could 'accurately forecast the future'. A practical illustration of this was the regional survey Geddes made of Edinburgh: it provided examples in buildings and civic layout which best revealed the importance of the past in the present. 27 Geddes reproduced a number of illustrations showing the development of Edinburgh from ancient times. The city is organised around an axis that focusses on Edinburgh Rock and is reminiscent of the megalithic alignments elsewhere in Britain (figure 3.13). The studies of the mediaeval city demon- strate a clear east-west axis running along the ridge betw een the castle on the rock and the abbey town in the distance, with a cr oss-axis connecting a cluster of smaller monasteries and churches outside the town to the port in the north. Geddes goes on to compare this relationship between the castle rock, the plain below and the sea port of Edinburgh with the re lationship between the Acropolis , the Attic Plai n and Piraeus, the port of Athens. Like Norman Lockyer, Geddes recogni sed an ancient organising principle which was common to Egypt, Gr eece and Britain. As he published a number of articles on the megalithic builders and the ancient Celts in Nature and other journals, he would have been aware, too, of the debate on axia lity and symbolism as revealed by astro- archaeology. 28 Lockyer was an eminent scientist of his day (he di scovered the gas helium), but he was denigrated in conventi onal archaeological circles. Geddes, equally, was unpopular in conventional academic circle s, as revealed by Helen Meller, who describes Geddes's writi ngs on 'Romanticism, nature worship, the forays into Celtic past' as 'delightfully unconventional in comp arison with the norms of social behaviour"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" of Edinburgh society'. 29 His 'unconventionally ' would surely have appealed to the Griffins. In 1900, then an influential member of a group which advocated a 'sociological approach to the Garden City', Geddes sp ent a number of weeks in Chicago, where he met Walter Burley Griffin. 30 It appears that he had much in common with the Griffins — in ascribing creative thinki ng to the ancient Greeks and in his advocacy of a return to the religious ideals of the past as a prel ude to their restatemen t in modern form. His notion of 'evolutionary perception' of the ci ty, 'street by street, district by district', finds parallels in the Griffins' method of the gradual unfolding of the government group in Canberra. It may well be that Patrick Geddes introduced the Griffins to Norman Lockyer's work on axiality. Meller point s out that Geddes and his contemporary Branford were in 'pursuit of cosmic idealism . . . which appealed to many . . . struggling to establish value systems in the modern wo rld'-\" Marion and Walter must have been aware of Geddes's Edinburgh survey and its accompanying draw ings which formed part of his well-known 'Cities and Town Planning Exhibition'. All the material for this exhibition had been published in the British Town Planning Conference Transactions of 1910, a document which all competitors in the Fe deral Capital Competition were advised to"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"a.

The Transactions also contained an article by John Sulman, who went to England from Australia to prom ote the international competition. 32 THE INFLUENCES OF THE NEW RELIGIONS In 'Notes on Abstract Art', Bernard Smith wr ites on the influence of the modernist reli- gions, Spiritualism, Th eosophy and Anthroposophy: 1 began to read everything I could find on Steiner, including his own varied works. One day it struck me with al l the force of an illuminati on. Here of co urse lay the source, power and influence of m odern abstract art. It was the religious art of the twenti- eth century, and its origins lay not in the gr eat traditionalist relig ions but in the new syncretic religions such as spiritualism, theosophy and anthroposophy that had begun to emerge in the later nineteenth cent ury with the decline of Christianity.\" In expanding on Bernard Smith's theme, Sixt en Ringbom's seminal article on the whole question of abstraction and th e occult revealed how abstract artists such as Kandinsky and Mondrian — who had embraced, respectively, Anthroposophy and Theosophy — were deeply influen ced by the little book Thought Forms, by Annie Besant and C W Leadbeater (1901). 34 The Theosophical Society, established in 1875, was the outgrowth of a small group consisting of Madame Helena Blav atsky, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott and William Quan Judge, as well as Besant and Leadbeater, who had attended a lecture by George Felt on The Lost Proportion of the Eg yptians'. As the story goes, Olcott, dur- ing the discussion following the lecture, suggested that it would 'b e good to form a society that focussed on this kind of study'; s o, with the approval of the others present, the Theosophical Society was formed. 35 Theosophy became an im portant vehicle which accelerated the revival of interest in the culture of the ancient worl d and the relationship between religion, art and architecture. It focussed on the lost canons and sciences that Theosophists believed had directed and cont rolled all aspects of life in the ancient world. The work of Sir Norman Lockyer and his associates on the megalithic monuments of ancient Britain and the Greek and Egyptian temples in many ways provide d Theosophists with the physical evidence for the existence of a canon which regulated the universal cul- ture thought by some to have emanated from the lost city of Atlantis. Thought Forms, by Besant and Leadbeater, provide d immediate resonances with esoteric writings in both Eastern and We stern cultures, and by the beginning of the twentieth century Theosophy had become a st rong cultural force that was felt in many aspects of life. In A N Art of our Own-, the Spiritual in Twentieth Century Art, Robert Lipsey writes that Theosophy was clos ely linked to the art world, generating 'a visual lan- guage that was to enter the mainstream of twentieth cent ury art — the abstract image — the Thought Form — perception of the et heric realm'. It was a new school of thought towards which artists and seekers c ould look for a new and radically different description of the world. Lipsey notes that: "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"42 S6CR6T pL*.W Op CAWBCRR1 Theosophy was powerful enough to point arti sts towards a new inwardness and the possibility of translating that inwardness into visible form. ... An informed poetry of the cosmos is needed no less than an info rmed science, and Theo sophy gave some the courage to seek it. 36 Writing of Mondrian, Michel Seuphor observed that he: was long interested in theos ophical speculations. As late as 1916 the portrait of Mme Blavatsky hung on the wall of his studio. Yet in his writings he made no mention of his theosophical sympathies. Even in private conversat ion he avoided religious topics and closed up at the slightest hint of them.\" With regard to the Griffins' early activities in Chicago it appears that much the same could be said of them as Michel Seuphor sa ys of Mondrian. While there is no evidence that Marion and Walter had any official connection with the movement before or after their sojourn in Canberra, the Magic of America reveals the profound impact Theosophical ideas had on both of them, and on Marion particularly. Later, after leav- ing Canberra in 1920, they became member s of Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy Society. Many professional architects may not have been active members of the Theosophical Society, but they were wh at Robert Welsh describes as small 't' theosophists, whose work re flected a casual — though serious — acquaintance with the literature. And at Steinway Hall, Chicago, the Griffins were at the core of a dynamic movement that deeply affected all their colleagues, who were just as secretive about the influences on their work as the Gri ffins were. It is now clear, however, that Louis Sullivan's concept of tr anscendental ornament was infl uenced by the theories of the eighteenth century Swedish mystic , Emanuel Swedenborg, and both John Wellborn Root and Daniel Burnham belonged to the Swedenborgian church. 38 Claude Bragdon was a member of the Theosophical Society and his book, The Beautiful Necessity: Architecture as Frozen Music, Seven Essays on Theosophy and Architecture {first published in 1910), sought to revive the Py thagorean principles of num ber, proportion and geome- try or sacred geometry in modern architecture. 39 This very popular book was an influ- ential source of inspiration to architects , many of whom became important contribu- tors to the 'organic movement in architecture. Bragdon described the im portance of the Vesica, the fi rst symbol of Christianity (and the basis of the Canberra geometry), to the medieval masons, who used it as the basis for their planning and proportions. He also wr ote that the geomet- ric forms generated from the Vesica were gi ven certain symbolic interpretations by the ancients. Bragdon's summaries were consiste nt with the Theosophical concepts pro- pounded by Helena Blavatsky. The rhombus, consisting of two equilateral triangles, represents the world above and the world below, or, in alchemical terms, the male and female principles of creation — the two br ought together creating universal harmony. The square, triangle and circle are the most significant for 'the circle is the symbol of the universe; the equilateral triangle of the higher Trinit y (Atma, Buddhi, Manas), and "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"x qeoOTAwnc cnoOeL 4 3 the square, of the lower quatern ary of man's sevenfold nature'. 40 The influence of Claude Bragdon's work, which became available at the time of the development of the design for Canberra, can be seen in Marion's writings in the Magic of America. The vegetable kingdom transfers the spirit to matter, mathematics to life, the ether shapes the leaves from circular to triangular Australia's archangel was the greatest of artists playing with forms. Griffin emulated him in playing with forms. Spirits conceived life in the triangle and the sphere. Goethe sensed this. 41 Bragdon calls for a new archit ecture for the modern world. It is not unreasonable to believe that the movement towards mysticism, of which mod- ern theosophy is a phase and the spiritialisa tion of science an episode, will flower out into an architecture which will be in some sort a reincarnation of and a return to the Gothic spirit, employing new materials, new methods and developing new forms to show forth the spirit of the modern world without violating ancient verities. 42 The Canberra plan — with its clear referen ces to ancient geoman tic models such as Stonehenge, the Salisbury Pl ain triangularity, the long ax ial arrangements of monu- ments in the landscape, together with the symbolic implications of the geometry — answers Bragdon's call both in its architecture for the Capitol and the government group and in the heroic scale of the land-planni ng. Marion and Walter's personal cos- mogony finds its symbolic expression in Canb erra — its geometry arising from the Vesica, and its axiality, both being clearly derived from sacred an d divine traditions. This geometry represents, moreover, an orde r for creativity and success in the modern world. Walter writes in the Magic of America: When I was a boy I consulted Herbert Spencer's philosophy for enlightenment, and found architecture considered virtually as an ecclesiastical appendage; the notion seems a preposterous limitation and 1 feel su re that my reaction represents the typical modern attitude towards this art. Just so. But after studying the buildings and noting with an astonishment the ab sence of creative architecture in the Western world for half a millennium, in fact since Mediaeval times, the force of Spencers observations became striking, if not conclusive. Moreover in the face of the worldwide testimony of the stones that the religious structures have been the only ones to make a lasting con- tribution to the art of architecture, it is m eet to give pause as to which architecture is when considered a living growing thing, not a graveyard. . . . For the beginnings of a fresh l i f e we ha ve to go from the mass opinions to those of the few pioneers who have for about a cen tury now been exploring the complexities of the human mind and soul and the conditions for a full rounded healthy working. From these students a practical religion may be forthcoming compatible with modern objective science but taking into account, wit hout prop of external agencies, our vaster subjective activities, desires a nd needs. Then again will the imagination and the cre- ative powers of mankind be unbound and free for an architecture as far transcendent of historical efforts as is the science of construction and our economic power. 43 "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"NOTES 1 The City Beautiful urban design method is described and illustrated in T H Mawson Cioic Art- Studies in Town Planning, Parks, Boulevardes and Open Spacts Batsford London 1911. 2 J Rykwert The Idea of a Town, the Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy and the Ancient World M.I.T.

The 'closest adjacent flat lands' of the northern side of the basin, the public gardens studded with other public buildings, would then serve as a 'parquet' for the 'theatrical whole' with the commerci al portion of the city forming a 'dress cir- cle'. 1 This analogy is pursued in a second report, which accompanied the submission of the Preliminary Genera l Plan to the Department of Home Affairs in October 1913. Taken altogether, the site may be consider ed as an irregular amphitheatre — with Ainslie at the north-east in the rear, fl anked on either side by Black Mountain and Pleasant Hill, all forming the top galleries; with the slopes to the water, the audito- rium; with the waterway and flood basins, the ar ena; with the southe rn slopes reflected in the basin, the terraced stage and setti ng of monumental Government structures sharply defined rising tier on tier to the culminating highest internal forested hill of the Capitol; and with Mugga Mugga, Red H ill, and the blue dist ant mountain ranges, sun reflecting, forming the back scene of the theatrical whole. 2 The organisation of the govern ment group and the Capitol, controlled within a 'the- atrical space', is clearly modelled on anci ent Greek precedents and on the associated religious symbolism based on the cave shrine within the sacred mountain, where the mountain itself was the place of worship. With the development of the temenos (or sacred place), the cave shrine was replaced by architectura l elements or else it was moved and embedded in a new construction, as at Palestrina near Rome (figure 4.1). Ramps, stairways and platforms gave access to the theatre temple, which often referred back to the deified mountain in controlled vistas achieved by par tial hiding and reveal- ing of certain features of th e site in labyrinths and sepu lchres. Other hills and moun- tains were gradually incorpor ated into the composition by the creation of additional controlled vistas and axial alignments. Wher e certain aspects of th e site did not meet the necessary criteria in terms of closure or area of focus, as happened at Pergamon, for instance, tumuli were constructed as visual controls. Other lands cape configurations surrounding the city, which recalled or symbolised the city gods, would also gradually acquire sacred significance. Finally, in tur n, temple alignments and city construction became focussed on connecting vistas that in corporated man-made features and these landscape elements. Although the etymology of the Indo-European root 't ern' is disputed, it does seem to be intimately connected with the pr ocess of ritual planni ng. Not only is it common to temenos {the sacred place), and templum (temple, the sacred house), but also to tempus, possibly alluding to the ancient conception of time as circular. The same root appears in terminus in the sense of a boundary point or stone marker, deified as Terminus, the god of boundaries. The corresponding word for boundary or term inus in Greek was oros, a word that also meant 'mountain'. Although oros had a variety of technical uses in Greek logic"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" and mathematics, its use in reference to natural boundaries — su ch as mountain, or mountain range — may be much older. The E gyptians, too, in observing the sun's pas- sage across the sky, regarded the surrounding mountai ns as the natural termini of the sun's progress. This seems to be the meani ng of the Egyptian hieroglyph that pictures the disc of the sun appeari ng between two mountain peaks.' From oros and related te rminology we can discern the double function of mountains and other prominent landscape fe atures as both natura l boundaries of the human environment and as principal referen ce points for the design and orientation of the most important cons tructions in that land scape, particularly th e site of the town and its princi pal monuments.' At the time of the design for Canberra published material on this relationship between site topography and ar chitecture in ancien t city construction was available to Walter and Marion Griffin. Examples of such material were included in the Transactions of the 1910 Town Planning C onference (London), one of the reference documents for the Federal Capital Competitio n. It contained an illustration of the ancient city of Ephesus (figure 4.2), showi ng the axial alignment of the Grand Forum, the Agora Civilis, the Gymnasium and the City Port, a ll set on terraces, with the prominent rock outcrop behind. There was also a restoration of the city of Priene revealing a similar relationship; this ti me, a north-south axis that connects temple complexes on the "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"acropolis with the city centre on the lower plain and extends to the outer regions of the city. It also showed th e city structure of Edinburgh paralleled with that of Pergamon,. the Castle rock in Edinburgh (see figure 3.13) corresponds to the Pergamon acropolis. 5 In the Canberra plan the Griffins seem to establis h a further parallel. Their emphasis on the role of terracing along the north-facing frontage, the interconnection of landscape elements and the frequent refe rence to the elements of the city placed analogous to a 'theatre' indicates a commitme nt to the pattern of an ancient city. It might be reasonable, therefore to take advantage of the maximum possibilities of the site, by bold free strokes to produce such a monumental and inspiring garden and building grouping, massing and impressive a pproach as could be nearest approximated only in the small but splendid rocky cities of Antiquity, of formally correlated struc- tures, squares and terraces. 6 The parallel between Canberra and ancient city design is amplified in Walter Griffin's essay on 'Architecture'. The city presents itself as an amphitheatre, the playgrounds (the Mt Ainslie side of the lake) providing a gathering place for the a udience, the Parliamentary buildings occu- pying the stage, giving the impression of one great building like some of the superb structures of Indo-China, presenting a faca de one mile in length and piling terrace on terrace, the Water Gate in the centre with the judiciary buildings on the lower level flanking the forum formed by bridging the leve l of the first terrace out over the roof of the Water Gate; the next level occupied by various departmental buildings grouped about a central court with its pool giving a stately and charming out door resort to the members of the Government. Terminating th e court is the Parliament House set on a level some 40 feet above that of the court at its feet. This whole garden frontage on the main buildings of the city starting with the peak of Ainslie to the north is termi- nated by the Capitol Building some 60 feet above the Parliament House. Thus the stage with its lovely setting of the hills and mountains in the distance, the whole reflected in the lakes in the foreground makes the city itself a national monument. 7 In this description of the vertical hierarchy of the Canberra design — the relationship between the hills and mountains reinforced by monumental architectural grouping on terraces — the application of the Greek city model is clearly revealed (see figure 4.3). The articulation and manipulation of space in Greek city planning, as described by Vincent Scully, involved an intentional 'theatrical heightening' of the religious experi- ence for the participants moving through the temenos. Movement was controlled by the creation of positive and negative spaces, the juxtaposition of voids and solids, which in turn generated a ritualistic procession. In this way the gods, embodied in specific land- scape features, were revealed through the c ontrolled vistas. Scully describes this move- ment and sense of gradual revelation at the Acropolis in Athens. . . . turning the bastion on the new terrace, climbing then due east and entering at an angle through the propy lon, seeing the cone (Mt Lycabe ttos) and then turning to the "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"52 seCRGT pLAN Op CAMBERRA right, the worshipper would have had two temp les coming forward almost side to side across the top of the hill. One fixed object in the middle distance, the cone of Lycabettos on the left, would thus have serv ed as a foil to the two temples near at hand and have emphasised their sculpturally a ggressive characters as they loomed over the crest. The base of the older Parthenon would have been somewhat higher than the temple of Athena Polias, but that, too, was placed on an extremely high platform built out across the space where the summit of the Acropolis began to fall rapidly to the west and north. The effect would have been two large forms, with very little space between them, rising upon the highest contour from the propylon. One would have been overwhelmed by the double presence of Athena, but the reiteration might have had a rather redundant quality. The fronts of the temples would have almost lined up with each other, reducing, thereby, the capac ity for each form to be seen as an inde- pendent force. The two temples would, however, have been opening slightly toward the west with some effect of fanning actively towards the observer. At the same time they also had the opposite quality of setting up a long, rather tunnel like perspective towards the east, in which direction they, of course, faced. As one mounted the hill through the purely negative space between the two temples, one would have come high enough to discover the object of their perspective, the Horns of Hymettos, towards which the two buildings would have directed the view of the observer with the velocity of a flung javelin. As one p assed beyond the shorter temple of Athena Polias, the much longer flank of the old Parthenon still emphasising the perspective towards the Horns, one would have seen th e complementary shape of Lycabettos ris- ing up once more to the north east, beyond the great altar of Athena. In this way Lycabettos would have again answered a ve ry definite need by giving some lateral expansion to the longitudinal direction of the Acropolis shape and its focal horns. 8 In the ascent of the Acropolis only small sections of the architectural composition could be perceived at a particular time. It was not until the observer had proceeded to the northern extremity that the total or der of the composition, the relationship between the temples and landform, became clea r. Such a 'theatrical' arrangement of the site, a procession through se t pieces, can be like ned to the earlier labyrinths, through which the participant had to travel as part of specific religious ritual. It is to this kind of architectural composition that Walter Griffin was alluding in his descriptions of the vertical hierarchy of Canberra- Monumental ar chitecture set on terraces in a carefully contrived vertical hierarchy, with the Capitol framed against the mountain background and an overarching geometrical alignment of man-made elements placed in relation to other hills and mountains, all combine to illustrate the rejuvenation of the Greek prin- ciple of city planning- If one could visu alise moving through the government group, with its juxtaposition of po sitive and negative space, the composition could only be perceived, as in the Greek city, section by section: the setting of the judiciary, the departmental buildings, the Parliament House and finally the Capitol. The same principle of ritualistic progression was frequently expressed later at Castlecrag, which became a substitute for Ca nberra, in the numerous 'Mystery Plays' staged by the theatrical society organised by Marion. "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Here in the temple forecourt, the enraged king Tauris was appeased by the appearance in the temple forecourt of Diana herself, and the wonderfu l procession was formed to follow Iphigenia carrying the sacred statue down the steps with the maidens and sol- diers following, wending their way across the valley and up the hillside, across the top of the terrace and down, disappearing as th ey made their way to the water's edge. 9 DEMOCRATIC IDEALS AND 'CREATIVE THINKING' The Griffins' identification of architecture wi th sacred landforms had a further conno- tation, however. Their design also focussed w ith an exaggerated emotional intensity on the new religion of nature and democracy, as enshrined in the symbolism of the equi- lateral triangle connecting Capital Hill, City Hill a nd the Lake Park monument. Democracy had become the new spiritual ideal — a sentiment reflected in the words of H P Berlage, a pioneer of modernism and the teacher of Mies van der Rohe. For this modern movement to have any intrinsic value, that is to say possessing a guar- antee, of a possibility of develo ping into a great art, it must have, if it wants to respond to these considerations, a spiritual basis. A nd now, I am of the opi nion that the ideal side of this basis, the social ideal, i.e., that which gives direction to this organisation is the idea of Democracy. 10 Later, Walter Griffin rejo ins with: 'Democrac y, was to become the new Practical Religion compatible with the modern objective'.\" The parliamentary triangle of the Canberra initial plan can be interpreted as a symbolic representation of the structur e of the democratic ideal. Throughout the Magic of America Marion stresses that 'true democracy' can only be achieved through the appreciation of the values of a tripartite consisting of liberty, equality and fraternity. Equality is enshrined in 'the function of a de mocratic political organisation'; fraternity in 'the function of a co-operative mercantile centre'. Both are represented in Canberra: 'equality' in the general admi nistration centre sited around City Hill and the govern- ment groupings within the triangle; 'fra ternity' in the mercantile centre on Mount Pleasant stretching out towards City Hill. Li berty, 'the function of individualistic, cre- ative, productive and cultural activity', forms th e apex of the triangle, as represented by the Capitol building. The Capitol, a monume nt to the Australian people, a national archive, and a place of commemoration of Australian achievement, is set above the Parliament House, the judiciary, the execu tive and mercantile groups (see figure 2.4). 12 Marion argues that true democracy cannot be achieved without the completion of the triangle by liberty',- this, in turn, is possi ble only through 'creative thinking' as opposed to rational thinking. One would be in despair (as apparently all our communities are) if one hadn't glimpsed the fact that, though rational thinking does not suffice for the solving of life's prob- lems, there can be creative thinking. Some time ago, rational thinking was discovered by two men independently, Abraham and Aristotle . That kind of thinking sufficed for a millennium or two, suppleme nted occasionally by genius (a kind of intuitive think- "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"ing, really a gift from the Gods). Nowadays no one understands intuitive thinking so the Cods are ceasing to give these gifts. Now we have to learn them . . . now the cre- ation of a new type of thinking is as urgent as the creation of rational thinking was for the periods beginning with Abraham and Aristotle. 13 Marion's plea for 'a new type of thinking' which would focus upon spiritual rather than material concerns is reinforced when she wr ites that 'since the coming of Christ, the first half of man's evolution, the descent into matter was completed, it is now our task to bring about the ascent into the spirit'. 14 And Walter writes that the ostentation, imi- tation, greed, intolerance and anti-social forc es that actuate our civilisation could only be overthrown by a spiritual and mystic al revelation of the order of nature'. 15 This notion of intuitive thinking is a direct refe rence to the Gnostic and hermetic concept of nous, that which is intelligible and perceived c onsistently by the 'noetic', or intuitive faculty — the higher reason. 16 Apuleius (a pagan from Madaura, a Roman colony in north Africa) explains this concept in hi s discussion of Plato's philosophy: here, the reader should distinguish between that which changes and is sensible to touch and that which is perceived by the nous. There are also two natures (or essences) of th ings. And of these, one pertains to things which may be seen by the eyes, and touche d by the hand, and which Plato calls dox- astic (or the subject of opinion); but the other is the object of intellect and is dianoetic and intelligible. For pardon must be grante d to novelty of words, when it serves to illustrate the obscurity of things. And the form er nature is indeed mutable and easily to be perceived; but the latter, which is seen by the piercing eye of intellect, and is known and conceived by the acute energy of the reasoning power, is incorruptible, immutable, stable and invari ably and perpetually the same. Hence, also, he says, that there is a twofold method of interpretation (pertaining to them). For that visible nature is known by a fortuitous suspicion, and which is of no long duration; but this intelligible essence is demonstrated to exist, by true, perpetual, and stable reasoning. 17 This explanation, which stresses the sense of stability and permanence of ultimate real- ities, serves to clarify the Griffins' notion of rational, creative and intuitive thinking. By some means Marion, in particular, seems to have been aware of the dichotomy which developed among the early Christian Gnostics and philosophers. As Tobias Churton points out, 'What to some extent, the Gnostic has attained by the experience of gnosis, the philosopher sees by the piercing eye of the intellect'; and he goes on to say: By intellect, Apuleius does not mean what passes for intellect today, that is, the abstract binding power of reason — that which binds ideas in coherent patterns and assigns measure and proportion to them. A puleius means something operating by the energy of intelligence — it is a light one some times sees in the gardener's or crafts- man's eye when he or she comes to approach the very substance of their labours — the meaning of their contact with nature. It is a natural power and begins with the observation of nature, then extends to a communication with nature and then to the 'nature of nature' herself. 18 "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"This wisdom was handed down in a line of tr adition from the remote past. The Greeks inherited it from the Egyptians, and it manifests itself in the philosophy of Idealism of Plato, who wrote that 'the an cients were superior to us for they dwelt closer to the Gods'.\" The importance of Greek culture for th e Griffins lay in it s connection to this ancient line of trad ition; it was, therefore, a means through which this ancient wisdom might be reactivated for this modern age. To the ancient mystics, the gods, having created the spirituality of man, had withdrawn to the heavens owing to certain aberrations of human nature. If the term 'natural' or 'natural forces' could be regarded as equivalent to the 'gods', it appears that Marion and Walter shared the ancients' belief that, while the power of the gods is irre- sistible, it is not theirs to dispose of at w ill. The gods are confin ed to certain seasons and areas of influence which they are not fr ee to vary: those who understand the prin- ciples by which the gods are guided may th erefore direct these divine powers to human advantage. Hence, at a time when hu mans had a more harmonious relationship with the natural world, it wa s possible to channel these powers th rough society in such a way that the gods performed their correct f unction as agents of fertility, and not of destruction. 20 Through a re-application of the anci ent science of ge omancy — of man in harmony with nature — the Griffins sou ght to revive this harmonious relationship and to restore its fo cus on nature and the deified land forms. Canberra would be the vehicle for this new spirituality, which would pr ovide a cure for the ills of this material- istic and industrial age: when spiritual influences were concentrat ing to transform rati onal thinking (which had been necessary to bring about the individualising of man) into creative thinking which would give them freedom in the true sense of the word. 21 The emphasis placed on these ancient models in the Canberra plan is even more pro- nounced with the development of Castlecrag. It is a great work but it is only the beginning . It points to a new Australian Life, based upon a new Australian Id ea . . . The Idea may be summed up in a phra se,- Life is a fine art. 22 Descriptions of the planning of Castlecrag also used the analogy of the theatre. The layout of Castlecrag is like that of a theatre where eac h element is built upon, . . . everyone will have a view of the stage . . a natural acropolis, 300 feet above the water on the central peninsula is the civic centre, a sports field surrounded by public and semi-public buildings, entered from the bus iness thoroughfare through a semicircular colonnaded gateway . . . two na tural amphitheatres are located, the cove theatre on the water frontage, the Glen thea tre at the head of the valley. 23 The architecture of this suburban community was subordinated to the Greek theme, too. As Conrad Hamann points out, a number of the Griffins' buildings have a 'strong allusion to the temple form'. There was the use of columns and a pediment in the "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Harry Page house in Mason City, which recalls sacred treasuries or peripteral temples',- while their Winnetka House was 'virtually a temple in the landscape'. Their Australian houses continued these themes: Pholotia, their own house in Heidelberg , hinted at a Roman atrium,- while the verandahs on th e Canberra workers' houses, proposed in 1919, recall the portico. At Castlecrag, the Fe lsted House used full, open atria and the later Garrett and James houses framed th e central living spaces with thick, round columns. Marion hersel f referred to the Garr ett House as 'her te mple to Aphrodite'. Even the cultural life of th e community reflected the Greek idea,- at the community theatre, the children's plays, Steiner's myst ery plays and the Greek tragedies were all staged against the backdrop of a clear te mple form probably designed by Marion her- self. 24 After the Griffins' departure from Canbe rra, Castlecrag became the focus for a new, symbiotic 'Gol den Age'. In the Transactions of the 1910 Town Pl anning conference (London) Professor F Haverfield, while noting th at there were a number of ages when whole towns sprang up in one movement an d large urban areas were concinnated, expressed the view that the period around 1910 was one of these great ages. Two other examples he cited were the expansion of the Greek peoples under Alexander in the Hellenistic period and the rapid developmen t of the early Chinese towns in central Asia, both of which provided sources of inspiration for th e design of Canberra. 25 INFLUENCES FROM THE EAST The legacy of those much ol der paradigms derived from Ch inese models is similar to that of the Hellenistic era. Both systems employ a central axis in a north-south direc- tion as the key organisational device combined with an east-west intersection. In both, the preferred arrangement is the incorporation of a number of topographical features over a large distance: hills, mountains, outcrops and plains are combined with a large body of water. Both use a terraced arrangemen t of buildings and a hierarchical system of building displacement acco rding to function. Feng shui (Chinese geomancy) — with its stress on the mountain's importance as a sacred landform and its significance in city and architectural design and on the function of the axis as a means of unifying natural and man-made forms into 'ideal' representati ons of the cosmos — is clearly an impor- tant influence upon the init ial design for Canberra. At the time of the Canberra design the traditions of ancient city design based on Greek principles, having been lost, were in the process of being rediscovered by astro-archaeologists; the Chinese system, by contrast, was still in practical use and contemporary literature on the science of feng shui was detailed and comprehensive. Even if the predominant view of feng shui expressed in Western journals and books was to see it as an obstacle to progress and cultural reciproc ity, or as a mere superstition and pseudo-science, there were other, more favourable studie s. Ernst Eitel saw it as 'a recognition of the uniformity and universality of the operation of na tural laws . . . the idea of an organic unity and identity of the spiritual basis of life in nature and in indi- viduals', and as a practice th at represented 'the complete amalgamation of religion and"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"science'. Ernst Boerschmann was equally open-minded, writing that China exhibits 'a unity of culture which can onl y be dreamed of as in the days of ancient Greece or some other ideal period'. 26 Boerschmann and his colleague s saw, too, a coherent con- nection between Eastern culture and the 'idealism' of the ancient Greek world. The impact of the East on eighteenth and nineteenth century European and American culture is cl ear and well-documented. 27 The Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, particularly the Ho-o-den, the official exhibit of th e Imperial Japanese Government, introduced the art and architecture of the East directly to the Chicago Prairie School. Frank Lloyd Wright became an enthusiast for all things Japanese,- he established an outstanding collection of woodbl ock prints in the American middle west and, in 1905, travelled in Japan. In 1912 he published a small volum e containing a crit- ical appreciation of the Japanese print. Although Wright would never admit to it, Eastern art and architecture had a profound in fluence on his work; it was radically dif- ferent, a new and exciting alternative. 28 The first commission Wa lter Griffin had was the preparation of a town plan in China fo r a Chinese client, reve aling his early inter- est in Eastern artistic practice. 29 Before her marriage to Walter in 1911, Marion had worked for eleven years in Frank Lloyd Wright's studio, where she established the 'Japanese Style' as the epitome of Prairie School rendering. 30 The strong formal influence of Eastern art, with its sim- plicity of form relying on continuous line, is reflected in her work for Wright and, later, the practice of Walter Burley Griffin. Marion often employs a heightened or low- ered perspective eye-level combined with a balanced asymmetry in the composition. The eye is, thus, led from the left to the right or top to bottom of the sheet (a device also used in the Beaux Arts style), with the perspective exterior rendering being com- bined with elevations, plans and sections on a single sheet. In numerous examples of her work arch itectural forms seem to float in an undefined space: the Millard House plan, for in stance, is drawn as if hanging in space from the foliage. The Hardy House drawi ng overlaps on a number of panels, using the traditional Japanese screen as a model. And he r frequent use of ink on linen as a pre- sentation medium is reminiscent of Eastern practice, the Rock Crest Glen development being an essay in the direct application of these principles. Here, Marion adopts the heightened perspective viewpoint with the architectural form placed unobtrusively in a collage of large trees and sh rubbery. This drawing reveal s both Marion's familiarity with Eastern artistic tec hniques and her knowledge of th e philosophy which underlies that tradition: ch'i and f eng shui. Akin to Chinese painting an d landscape design (see fig- ure 4.4), the Rock Crest Glen drawings cr eate a perfectly 'sym biotic treatment of building and site', the quality of Marion's work that Paul Larson labelled 'a socialised nature mysticism'. 31 In the Melson House drawings nature predominates. The 'nature mysticism' emanates from the depiction of architectural form growing out from nature,- architec- ture being presented as simply another na tural form. Here, continuous line links the elements of the composition: trees, flowers, architecture, sky. In the foreground, plant- ing and flowering bushes cover an indefinite form, possibly a planter. The rusticated masonry walls of the house merg e with the stone steps that lead up to the garden and "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" these, in turn, blend into the lines which de fine the background foliage and the sky. It is almost impossible to determine where nature ends and the architecture begins. Marion's earlier drawing of Frank Lloyd Wr ight's Mess House celebrates similar ethereal compulsions in its depiction of the creeping foliage of the foreground merging with the background ma ss of trees and shrubs. The arch itectural solids are blurred by foliage and the large window panes reveal nature from the interior; the shrubs, trees and sky are connected to the inte rior space. This 'drawing in ' of nature in to the inter- nal spaces of the house is continued by Ma rion in her decorative schemes for the house interiors: in fire sc reens, and window a nd furniture designs, which frequently depict landscapes and foliage. The place of ma n within nature, commensurate with the principles of ch'i and feng shui, became the prime concern of the Prairie School. The presentation drawings for Canberra, too, clearly illustrate the formal and philosophical influence of East ern artistic practice. In th e City and Environs drawing, the centrepiece of the competition entry, the palette is restrict ed to mauves, browns, black and metallic gold,- very little green is used by Marion. Her preference for mauve and gold, especially gold, indicates a symbolic intention had displ aced naturalistic rep- resentation — the use of gold to symbolise sacred practices being common to Eastern and Western art.\" Reminiscent of her earlier work and inspired by Japanese screens,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"the Canberra perspective from Mount Ainsli e is rendered on connected panels (figure 4.5). The choice of the elevat ed viewpoint from Ainslie fo r the perspective is deliber- ate,- for, it is only from a height — as in the Greek cities — that the plan composition can be appreciated. Walter writes: The importance of such an orderly arrangement is very great and can be especially appreciated in a city surrounded by heights — so that from a bird's eye view one is repeatedly presented with the spectacle of the whole city. One of the chief pleasures we get in contemplation of any work of man is the consciousness that results . . . we rejoice in the evidence of intelligence. 33 A most distinctive feature of the Canberra C ity and Environs drawing is the treatment of the various mountains. Black Mountain, Mount Ainslie and Mugga Mugga are ren- dered as abstract, lumi nous balls, in sharp contrast to the opacity of th e deep browns and purples of the surroundings and to the formal geometry of the central area (see fig- ure 1. 1 ) . This symbolic device stresses the importance of the mountains in the design and also highlights the characteristic theme of Eastern geomancy: the life-force of nature. This efflorescent cloud-lik e treatment of the mountai ns resembles the Chinese landscape painting techni ques of the nature cu lt of the Taoist reli gion. The painter, in "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"6O SCCRCT pL&N Of CiMDeRRA the act of portraying the landscape, was para lleled with the Taoist mystic contemplat- ing the cosmos. To the painter the aim was to express the pr esence of the cosmic real- ity rather than just the topog raphical featur es of the land. The pa inter must be attuned to ch'i, the cosmic energy or life force that infu ses all forms: mountains, streams, trees, grasses, and the creatures whic h inhabit the land. It is in the abstract vitality of the painted form and, more literal ly, in the clouds and vapours — the visible symbols of this cosmic force — which emanat e from the mountains, that the ch'i is expressed. The physical is concealed,- the spiritual is em phasised. Marion's elevation of Mount Ainslie with the peak shrouded in cloud is an exte nsion of this concept (see figure 2.5) — a representation of th e spiritual, inner essence of nature. 34 This discovery of the philosophies of Ea stern art deepened the Griffins' appre- ciation of the 'inner spiritual side of na ture', which had already become, by 1910, an integral part of Vitalistic' Romantic theory filtering through to the Griffins from the work of Louis Sullivan, himself infl uenced by Sweden borgian mysticism. 35 Further impetus was found in Thought Forms, the seminal work by Annie Besant and Charles Leadbeater which was such an unparalleled source of insp iration for modern abstract art. Thought Forms discusses the concept of aura s surrounding the human body, which are altered by varying thought s and moods (see figure 5.7). Marion's renderings, many in full colour, in their depiction of spirit ual energy and force radiating from all living things, exhibited a definite connec tion with the Taoist concept of ch'i. Taoism itself offered insights into the 'Wis dom Tradition' espo used by the Theosophical Society- Marion writes of this inne r spiritual quality in the Magic of America. In Australia, I have stood look ing over the valley and sudden ly . . . the cloud like for- mation of the Chemical ether outlining with a wide band all the trees and shrubs, a phenomenon checked by thousands of others which can be experienced at will again and again if your etheric eye has become active. 36 An early influence on Marion was the idea, drawn from herm etic thought, that art and religion should be unified wi th science. She believed that the role of the twentieth century artist and architect was to 'reunite th e three into a true uni ty'. From her numer- ous references in the Magic of America to atomic theory, it is clear that this was one influence on her render ing of the splintered and crysta lline forms of the mountains in the City and Environs drawi ng. She writes that the smashing of the atomic form frees the spiritual forces of matter. Thus, We stern science had demonstrated what the ancients had known all along: th at the physical forces are no t vibrations of matter, but are their predecessors, the creators of matte r. In the Canberra drawings the glowing, mystical, esoteric landscape forms ad roitly express Ma rion's conviction. 37 Feng shui, as the philosophy of Chinese landscape design and as the integral element of landscape painting, was based on an understanding of the influence exerted by the ch'i over the growth and ch ange of all phenomen a in the world. The ch'i, which is believed to flow th rough the ground, its conduit, is posited as prevalent in heaven and on earth, and people, living and dead, are under its control. It is under the active, cosmic force of ch'i that the integration is ach ieved of the two forces yin and yang —"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"the Chinese concept of the two principles of creation (male and fema le) that give rise to the world's phenomena. If ch'i is not properly treated, the de stiny of humans in rela- tion to the site will be affected. Chinese geomancers believed that the currents of ch'i and their presence on earth are linked with the topography: part icularly, mountains, watercourses and vegetation. 'Geography', to the Chinese, therefore means not only the external appearance of surface configurations but also the inner life force of ch'i: both are interdependent and inseparable. Th e purpose of Chinese geomancy was, and continues to be, the location of sites with abundant ch'i, which can be beneficial to life. Sang Hae Lee notes that the term feng shui is a concatenation of tsang feng, meaning lit- erally 'the calming of the waters', and te shui , meaning 'the acquiring of water'. A site which meets these criteria is regarded as auspicious. 38 A site that is 'ideal', according to f eng shui principles, is characterised by a num- ber of distinct feat ures (see figure 4.6): • it should face south (or, in the southern hemisphere, north), to enj oy the health- giving and psychological benefits of a warm and well-lit environment; • it should be backed by a range of hills or trees, to ward off bad influences,- • it should be located midway up the range, with an unobstructed foreground that allows extensive views to the north,- • there should be mountains on the west (the Azure Dragon) and on the east (the White Tiger), to form a protective arm around the site — th ese mountains indi- cating the presence of the two forms of ch'i, the yin and yang-, • there should be a sma ll pool of water (a 'heaven pool') at th e front of the site, and a large body of slow-moving water in the distance. These principles are strikingly parallele d in the initial plan for Canberra- As already mentioned, the foci of the design, the Capitol and the government group, are "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"62 SCCRCT PlAKl Of ClWBeRRi sited in relation to a secondary hill, Kurrajong or Capital Hill, which is sheltered by a high mountain range to the south (Bimberi Peak in the Brindabellas) — a relationship that is stressed in the drawings. To the west of the Capitol is the Azure Dragon (Black Mountain),- to the east, there is the Whit e Tiger (Mugga Mugga). From the Capitol the view is unobstructed towards Mount Ainslie in the north. A quiet 'heaven pool' is included in the design — the large courtyard pool in the foreground of the Griffins' government group — and in the di stance the formal and info rmal basins of the lake constitute a slow-moving body of water (see figure 1.1 ). 39 While these correspondences are striking enough, there are further parallels to be found between the Canberra plan and Eastern planning systems. Feng shui not only determined the correct placement of buildings in the topographical structure, it also governed the broader categories of archit ectural design and city planning. In 1911, after spending three years in China, Ernst Boerschmann presented a paper to the Smithsonian Institute entitled, 'Chinese Architecture and its relation to Chinese Culture'. He notes that Chinese architecture, city design, the arts and religion are gov- erned by a single idea. One imposing conception of the universe is the mainspring of all Chinamen, a con- ception so comprehensive that it is the very key defining all expression in life, trade, intercourse, customs, religi on, poetry and especially the fine arts and architecture. They exhibit in nearly ever y work of art the universe an d its idea. The visible forms are the reflex of the divine. They behold the divine in the various forms which they fashion to express it,- in short, in the micr ocosm is recognised and revealed the macro- cosm. 40 A number of the points made by Boerschmann in this paper seem to find expression in the Griffins' original design. In particular, there is the use of the axis to link the land- scape elements, both natural and constructed, which reflects the structure of the cos- mos. He writes that the axis: brings points into correlation and features of nature, rivers and mountains, separated from one another by miles, to unite them in the expression of some definite idea. One of the most definite expressions of this prevailing Chinese idea of unity is given by the groupings of all buildings symmetrically around the axis of the meridian, the north-south line. This is invariable whenever possible. The main hall in which the Prince sits in state, or the host entertains his guests, or the Cod in his temple, is invari- ably aligned to face the south. The lord faces the midday sun. The cities are likewise laid out along the meridian line accurately , and, where natural obstacles intervene, such as a mountain, a river, or where other special considerations require the city walls to deviate and take some other direction, yet the axial line is always maintained in the meridian in all the temples, gove rnment buildings and dwellings. 41 In this sense the Chinese system can be compared with the great geomantic construc- tions discussed previously, and the symbolism and axiality of the Canberra plan can therefore be explained in terms of traditions from the East and the West. All these tra- "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"ditions stress the north-sout h axis, around which the heaven s were thought to revolve, as the dominant organising principle of th e total design. In the Canberra plan the north-south axis links Mount Ainslie, the Casino, the Lake , the government group, the Capitol, Red Hill, and Bimber i Peak. The east-west axis links Black Mountain, the uni- versity, the Lake, the Lake Park monument and extend s down the Molonglo Valley. The north-south axis of Canberra, with a clear idea and intention in mind, controls the placement of the buildings symmetrically arranged alo ng the axis. The references made by the Griffins to 'an or derly arrangement', to 'the spectacle of the whole city', and to 'the consciousness that results', all indicate a recognition of Eastern traditions — a parallel referred to by Walter when he writes: The city presents itself as an amphitheatr e, the playgrounds providing a gathering place for the audience, the parliamentary buildings occupying the stage, giving the impression of one great building like some of the superb structures of Indo-China. 42 The axis in Chinese geomancy had a deep symbolic significance — an 'ideal' impor- tance. Boerschmann, when discussing the capital of China, Peking, stresses the significance of its location. China has often changed its Capital. The Empire has been ruled from the Yangtze, from Honan, and Shensi; but for long ages, even before the Mongolian dynasty, they have always returned to Peking, which lies in the extreme north. Th is was, of course, mainly due to political considerations. Bu t knowing the ideal importance which is attributed to the line of the axis, we ca n appreciate the exalte d notion of conceiving the Emperor as seated on the dragon throne in Peking and turning his gaze along the meridian of Peking (the north-south axis) over the entire Empire, when at New Year Festival, or on the Emperor's birthday, a lt officials and many people assemble at the same hour in all the cities and all the villages, kneel before his altars throughout the Empire and offer their homage, looking north towards him, the Son of Heaven. 43 Thus, according to Ernst Boerschmann, Peking's location and design combine natural orders and observance s, and ideal conceptions, with political objectives so that the power of the emperor can be felt throughout the country. John Michel l explains this 'ideal' concept clearly. The Ch inese believed that the welf are of the empi re depended on the correct placement of the city according to feng shui principles. Therefore, the capital city must be placed at the nodal point of a networ k of Dragon lines — lines of power which ran to and from the emperor to every part of his domain. The emperor is thus imbued with the energi es of the entire country. 44 This 'ideal' notion is carried further by Boerschmann when he points out that Peking was conceived as the symbolic centre of the universe as well as of the nation. Peking was designed as a microcosm of the worl d, with the four sides of the city con- taining the temples of He aven: agriculture, the sun, the moon and the earth. Boerschmann argues that the Chinese 'regar ded the entire count ry as a rhythmic whole' related to the conc ept of the sa cred mountain. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"There are five ancient, sacred Chinese mount ains, one each in the north, south, east and west and one in the centre. Nature co ntributes more, as in the western mountain of Huashan in Shensi which has five sharply outlined highest peaks that again illus- trate the centre and four cardinal directions . This is likewise the case at the Buddhist mountain Wut'Aishan, whose five highest peaks present an image of the universe, which is also emphasised by its five sacred colours. Each of these old Chinese Sacred mountains that rise up majesti cally from out of the midst of the plains has a large tem- ple at its foot. The extension of the axes of these temples leads directly across the highest point of the sacred mountain.\" The Griffins adopt this 'ideal ' notion in Canberra: the city is designated the symbolic centre of the nation, the omphalos in the Western geomantic tradition. The way that the avenues, all named after the State capitals, radiate from the circles on Capital Hill, alludes to the noti on of Canberra as caput mundi and to the Eastern concept of the reflection of the macrocosm in the microcosm: the transfer of power from the centre, the seat of government, to the entire country. The lands cape proposal for West Lake reinforces this concept and proposes an even grander global scheme. The area around the lake was to be divided into eight zone s: Australia, New Z ealand, Europe, Asia, North America, South America and the South Sea Islands. Each zone was to be planted with indigenous flora. 46 The Chinese cosmological concept of th e sacred mountain finds its echo in Canberra's design, which is also controlled by five mountains: four representing the cardinal directions (north, Ainslie), (sou th, Bimberi), (east, Mugga Mugga) , (west, Black Mountain), with one at the centre (Mount Kurrajong or Capital Hill). This inter- pretation is consistent with the concept of Bimberi Peak as the sacred mountain, that is to say, in the same sense as Monte Cavo or Mount Olympus. In keeping with the Chinese tradition the most important building (the seat of the emperor or the temple of the gods) is in the centre of the com position. In Canberra the Capitol, a symbolic monument to the new democrac y in Australia, is the cent repiece and, like the temple "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Ainslie, Rosy Hill; Mo unt Pleasant, Purple Hill,- a nd Black Mountai n, Golden Hill. This association of h i l l s a nd mountains with specific co lours is reminiscent of the Buddhist sacred mountain Wu t'Aishan (figure 4.7), each of whose five highest peaks, symbolic of the universe, were associated with one of the five sacred colours. 47 Writing about Castlecrag in the Magic of America, Marion identifies the sm all peak of Covecrag with Mount Fuji in Japan, which suggests that she had a long-standing acquaintance with the Eastern concept of the sacred mountain. 48 Clearly, the Griffins were aware of the Chinese models of city planning, land- scape design and architectonic organisation. A nd these ideas from the East, in combi- nation with ancient planning traditions fr om the West — at a time when the latter were once more being brought to light the former were still in use — together, pro- vided Marion and Walter Griffin with inspira tion for the matrix for Canberra as a new 'democratic' order, expressed symbolica lly as their own cosmogony through the geom- etry of the Vesica.

Theosophy and, later, Anthroposophy both drew on the ancient 'Wisdom of the East' and the 'occult and heretical byways of Western thought 2 ; other movements, such as Rosicrucianism, the Swedenborg Church an d Freemasonry attain ed new levels of appreciation and popularity- 3 For many, an exploration of spiritualism and the occult became the next neces sary step to ensure proper hum an development and evolution: the new goal of the twentieth century. R udolf Steiner emphasised: that man was on the threshold of the beginning of a Spirit ual Era, that the moment had come when esoteric know ledge can become exoteric, that is, the ability to explore the higher worlds can now be made common property. 4 Art, architecture and literature became the ve hicles for this exploration of spiritual and philosophical issues. The emergence of the abstract image was, as recent critiques emphasise, the product of renewed interest in the occult and the esoteric 'by men and women who cared for things of the spirit'. 5 The search was on for an art that would, as Katherine Dreier describes i t , 'free the spirit of the behold er'. Paul Cezanne (1839-1906) continuously s ought in his art 'the esse nce of nature',- Kandinsky (1866-1944) the 'innerer Klang', the s oul of humanity and nature; Mondrian (1872-1944) 'the cosmic and un iversal'; Edvard Munch (18 63-1944) 'the inner images of the soul'. 6 Similar concerns also influenced architecture. Louis Sullivan, through a metaphysical theory of ornament, attempted to create a 'spiritual communion' between nature and architecture. Claude Bragdon's theories of fourth-d imensional geometry focussed upon a plane of existence beyond reality. Co nstructions by Br uno Taut and the German Expressionists, the 'Utopias of Class', symbolically represented 'extra- dimensional space and a higher spiritual plane'. 7 The spiritual and the romantic, the esoteric and the transcendental , had their impact on the li terature of the period, too. This interest in the spirituality of th e ancients was further intensified by, among other things, the discoveries of astro-archaeology, discussed in Nature and stud- ies of the ancient world such as Augustus le Plongeon's Maya/Atlantis, Qu een Moo and th e Egyptian Spinx. 8 It was this vitalit y, the search for the essence of nature and its mysteries, which came profoundly to influence the artistic deve lopment of Ma rion and Walter Griffin over a long period, as their writings in the Magic oj America clearly reveal. And now we know that clairvoyance was natu ral to pre-christian peoples, humanity had to lose this faculty temporarily in orde r to be able to reason — to think and to function with free will. That accomplished we must through our wills, learn again to perceive in the realm of the forces , in the realm of spiritual being.

For this, human beings must develop their spiritual powers of perception, the basis of a new form of thinking which will enable them to know causes as precisely and as thor- oughly as they know effects. It is an egoistic and vain presumption which must yield to attack in turn if such an attack be made from the vantage point of ma n's spiritual relationship with nature. For there is perfection, infinity and intellig ence in natural phenomena continually eluding the curiosity of the scientist and which therefore it is proper of our art to respect. 9 These sources of insp iration are evident bo th in the Canberra design of 1911 and also in the character of the drawings subm itted for the competition. The initial plan, although reflecting the practical and sociolog ical concerns of the City Beautiful and Garden City movements, was produced at a time when there was a certain rejection of the conventional, the traditional, and the standard. The Magic of America offers insights into the way in which other, more conventional, members of the Steinway loft in Chicago could have influenced the plan's preparation. 10 An indication of the Griffins' own idiosyncrasies is their use of axial and linear arrangements seemingly derived from contemporary literature on geomantic constructions and the influence of feng shui. Both Marion and Walter also subscribed to the vi ews of a group of ar chitects known as the Radicals'. This group was influenced by the new developments in Europe, especially in the Netherlands, Germany and Austria,- acco rding to Claude Bragdon, these architects with their new ideas were striving for an ar chitecture that 'would show the face of the Zeitgeist'. And it is the Griffins' use of the crystal motif in the geometrical structure of the plan and its architecture that stresses their links with such unconventional groups, particularly the Secessionists, such as Berlage and Behrens, and the German Expressionists, Taut, Berg and Stam. THE CRYSTAL AS A DESIGN ELEMENT In a recent study of the crystal-like quality of the monuments drawn by Marion for the Canberra plan — the Arsenal, the Cathedra l, the Legislatures and the Capitol — Conrad Hamann writes: 'Mario n has drawn in along the cr ucial points of the axis, notional buildings ... all of which are portrayed as crystals, angled, faceted and shim- mering'. Jennifer Taylor points out that the Capitol is reminiscent of Bruno Taut's crys- tal house or 'Stadtkrone', while James Weiric k emphasises that the 'mysterious esoteric quality of the Capitol building is very close in spirit to the early works of the German Expressionists'.\" Even though this quality has been acknowledged by various writers, there has been no analysis of its significance in the plan's architecture. An exploration of"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"the iconography of the crystal, its history and signi ficance — as well as the extent of its use in the Canberra work — yiel ds a number of symbolic meanings. In many ways, the Canberra design, rend ered by Marion, prefigures the work of the German Expressionists du ring the 1920s: there are stylistic parallels, especially in the architectural definiti on of city design. In Canberr a's Capitol, in Bruno Taut's 'Stadtkrone' and in the title vignette of Hans Kampfmeyer's publication, the Friedenstadt, the nucleus is a crystalline, faceted m onument towering over the surrounding, predom- inantly horizontal city-scape (figure 5.1). Another common tr ait is the romantic domi- nance of nature over man-made form. The Germans frequently place central monu- ments silhouetted agai nst a giant rising s un. Similarly, in the Ca nberra perspective, Marion depicts the Capitol unrealistically dwarfed by a huge Bi mberi Peak brought right up to the picture plane. Wolfgang Pehnt points out th at, in the German works, the stark verticality of the central monument was inte nded to conflict with the pragmatic conception of the garden city spreading around it. The inclusion of such vertical elements illustrated their interest in probing th e rational arguments of the Garden City proponents and exploring 'irrational' overtones as a means of expressing a re turn to the 'rejuvenation of the ancient soil'. The vertical forms, thus, become saturated with meaning as symbolic representations of the Expressionist ideal.\" In the Canberra drawings, the twin towers of the Casino seem to be used as a similar device: they di rect the eye to the peak of Mount Ainslie (figure 2.5). Some of Bruno Taut's work sugges ts that he, too, was famil- iar with the revelations of astro-archaeology — such as his 1920 rendering of 'Die Grosse Kirche', a group of buildings surround ed by four towers connected by a ring of 'cosmic' light (figure 5.2), or another drawing in Die Auflosung der Stadte entitled 'Heilig Heilig' (Holy Holy), of the sun, orbiting pl anets and stars over the plans for small communities (figure 5.3). The interaction of earthly monuments with heavenly bodies and lightning is, however, a feature of the crys tal iconographic trad ition.\" Also com- mon to the work of both the Griffins and the Expressionists is the use of the ziggurat form, together with the chiliastic them e of the 'Golden Age' and the emer gence of a new civilisation,- but perhaps the most striking parallel is the frequent use of the crystal motif by both. The crystal is employed not only as a de corative motif, but also as an ordering device applying to the architecture itself. Although Walter Griffi n stated {in the 'Original Report') that he was unsure of the ar chitectural style that should be used for Canberra, the detail of Marion's Canberra drawings suggests that she had no such doubts. The key buildings she includes throug hout the design are al l angled, faceted, complex structures of triangles, pyramids, spir es of concrete and glass, a l l displaying a radiant luminosity. This shimmering treatme nt of the buildings is echoed throughout the scheme by glowing mountain forms, with an emphasis on reflection — almost all the architecture being shown as reflected in the various lake basins (see figures 2.5, 4.3,4.5). The crystal form had already appeared in the Griffins' earlier work in America, such as the 1912 Clark Memorial Fountain at Grinell, Iowa, and on the parapet of the Melson House in Mason City. In their Aust ralian works the crysta l theme became the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"plan as well as in the atte ndant architectural design. In the Canberra plan for Capital Hill, derived from the Vesicas of three intersecting circles which cont rol the siting of the Capitol, the prime minister's residence and the governor-general's residence, there is a striking similarity with the 'Stadtkron e' layout by Bruno Taut (see figure 5.4). In Taut's work, this cruciform ge ometry with flanking arcua tions is drawn and described as fundamental to his 'crystalline' concept and it is the nucleus of his crystal houses. SYMBOLISM OF THE CRYSTAL The Germans' work generally appears after 1920, ten years after the preparation of the Canberra plan, but it indicates that they and the Ameri cans drew on a common icono- graphic tradition. The Griffins' references to this tradition are more difficult to explain but the Magic of America reveals that they, like the Germ ans, utilised the crystal as a symbolic metaphor of spiritual transcende nce, transformation, or transmutation. The German Expressionist movement had one clea r objective: to effect a 'changed society', a 'political metamorphosis', and to create a Utopian state out of the existing tangled political climate. Haag Bletter describes how the idea of transformation and metamorphosis, derived from crystal structure, emanates from an iconogra phic tradition which origi- nates largely in architectural fantasies of ideal constructs and also from esoteric and sacred writing: the legend of the Temple of Solomon, St John's biblical vision of the New Jerusalem, and the le gends and the anci ent mysteries su rrounding sacred Glastonbury. From such lege nds were developed light my sticism and transcendental- ism, which became associated with the crysta l, precious stones, wa ter and glass. They, in turn, illuminated Arabic legends and ar chitecture and became manifest in Gothic stained glass and architecture, the mystery of the Holy Grail and Renaissance stories of secular love such as The Dream of Poliph ilo'. And the movement liberated alchemy, ultimately influencing the my stical sciences of the seventeenth century Rosicrucian and Freemasonry movements. The most significant aspect of this iconographic tradition is that crystal, glass, water, precious gems and light become symb olic media of transcendence and are all interchangeable. In the Canberra drawings and design three glow ing elements domi- nate: the crystal, water, a nd luminous light. Alt hough the Expression ists' use of the crystal symbolism appears late r, a number of earlier repr esentations of the crystal metaphor, from the Germans and from other sources, can be directly linked to the Griffins' Canberra work. Some early legends incorporating the cr ystal motif occur in Eastern astrologi- cal traditions — in the tenth century Arabic stor y of the palace of the moving dome, for example, where Ab ar-Rahum Ill's hall was oriented towards, and circled the sun. These Eastern traditions may have been known to the Griffins, for their influence defi- nitely appears in Bruno Taut's drawings such as 'Heilig Heilig' and, in particular, 'Die Grosse Kirche'. Taut could possibly have absorbed this influence via the design and architectural fantasies on Islamic architect ure and garden designs by Paul Scheerbart. 16 "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"76 SCCRCT P L AW oe CAMBCRRA The crystal and the colouristic glass construc tions described in Scheerbart's poetry and novels are symbolic representa tions of transformation and 'e xtra dimensional space and a more spiritual world'. He introduces th e crystal metaphor through his visions of a new glass architecture that will dominate the future a nd effect the salvation of mankind. It is not unlikely that the Griffins were aware of Sc heerbart's writings, for the majority of his stories were based in America, particular ly Chicago. Indi rectly, these stories offered solutions to a number of probl ems of the modern age in relation to city design — solutions that would have appealed to Walter and Marion. The Chicago group of 'Radicals' were aware of, and keen to follow, artis tic developments in Europe; numerous ideas in Marion's later writings in the Magic of America are, therefore, in line with some of those expressed by Scheerbart . One in particular is the notion of an organic or 'growing' building material. In th e 'Hausbaupflanzen' of 1910, he writes of a chemist and botanist who invent ed a kind of liana which can be made to grow into house-like structures — 'I have invented growing houses. We need no longer build with dead materials'. 17 The Griffins' proposal for Canberra of materi als to create a glit- tering surface could be a further refere nce to Scheerbart's glass constructions. Probably the most influential use of th e crystal metaphor in a symbolic func- tion arose from the 'Symbolist' movement it self at the end of the nineteenth century. Peter Behrens's frontispiece for Feste des Lebetts und der Kunst (1900), and his illustration to Ein Dokument deutscher Kunst. Die Ausstellung der Kunstler-Kolonie (Darmstadt, 1901), used the crystal as 'Das Zeichen' (the sign), for th e artistic colony (figure 5.5). Haag Bletter points out that Behrens's use of the crystal at Darmstadt is a return to the mystical tra- dition of metamorphosis; in this case a metamo rphosis from everyday l i f e into a heightened artistic experien ce and an escape from materi al reality into the artist's visionary world — at the apex of a pyramid previously occupied by the aristocracy. In this case the applicat ion of the crystal metaphor seem s to be a direct reference to Nietzsche's mysticism. The final chapter of Also Sprach Zarathustra, in which Zarathustra emerges from his cave like the sun, is entitled 'Das Zeichen'. But, unlike Nietzsche, Behrens reintegrates the image of the philosoph er's stone with its older alchemical sub- stance — the crystal. 18 David van Zanten notes that th e architect Berlage adapted this 'crystalline' concept from Be hrens to architecture through the modular grid and this was further developed by the modernist Mies van der Rohe. And Peter Harrison points out that both Walter Griffin and Frank Lloyd Wright esta blished a sympathetic ambi- ence with the progressive European groups such as the 'Secessionists' in the Netherlands, Germany and Austria — especially Wright after his early domestic works were illustrated in the Wasmuth publication of 1909. 19 Yet another source influencing crystal mysticism was the 'Creative Forces' series of drawings produced by Wenzel Hablik in 1909 (see figure 5.6) and reviewed in Deutsche Kunst und Decoration in 1910, a magazine which was available in Chicago. Hablik continued the Germanic theme of the crystal metaphor in art and architecture, providing the basis for the later work of Br uno Taut and the Expr essionists. According to Eugene Santomasso, this series is a 'formu lation of Hablik's belief in creative forces in Nature as part of a cosmic whole' and 'Hablik chose to demons trate Nature's magic"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" to those who do not st and as strangers befo re the great microcosmic edifice of the world'. Hablik believed that the study of natura l phenomena, especi ally the crystals, for their intrinsic laws of form and struct ure would inspire new possibilities of expres- sion. The artist must succeed in recognising the la ws which are inhere nt in forms built by nature, and in disc overing similar laws which are applicable to his own creative work', he writes. Santomasso observes that 'Hablik was in terested primarily in those laws of growth and change peculiar to inorganic rather than organic forms. He regarded crystals as manifestations of the same spiritual force operative in organic phe- nomena'. These are similar ideas to the ones expressed in Arthur Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation. 20 It would appear that, collectively, these notions underlie the work of the Griffins in Canberra,- although the crystal me taphor is given a more lucid geometrical expression there. Hablik's series also make s it possible to see a coherent connection with Canberra and the later work of the German Expressionists. Broadly, both the work of Scheerbart and Ha blik demonstrates the cont inuation of cr ystal iconography within German Romantic thought emanating from figur es such as Goethe, in Faust and The Parable, and Nietzsche, in Also Sprach Zarathustra. 21 "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" Marion Griffin, influenced by Goethe's writi ng through its appreciation by Rudolf Steiner, used the symbolism of the crystal metaphor as a theoretical basis for aspects of her theory of art. 22 Steiner outlined his key aims for the ideal modern artist — the architect. Firstly, works of art, like works of nature, are produced according to divine necessity of true and natural la ws. Artistic creation is a higher form of Naturewirken. The work of art is the more perfect th e greater this adherence to the nat- ural laws is allowed to find expression; the beautiful is a manifest ation of the secret laws of nature. Secondly, art, religion and sc ience are inseparable a nd the artist brings down the divine to the earth, not by letting the divine flow into the world, but by rais- ing the 'world' into the sphere of divinity. This is the cosmic mission of the artist. These same themes recur throughout the Magic of America. 23 THE IDEA OF TRANSCENDENCE Mysticism and the esoteric had become chief sources of inspiration for the new art and architecture of the later nineteenth and ear ly twentieth centuries in both Europe and America, as we have seen. In 1903 the Theosophist Claude Bragdon wrote:"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"T?>e SYCDBO U SCD of it>e CRYSTAL  79 Beneath the dense materiality of our civilisat ion there is fermenting a leaven of spiritu- ality which may usher in a period of faith like that which Europe underwent in the Middle Ages, when Gothic architecture had its origin: a period in which the soul comes nearer to the surface of life, sweeping away existing conventions and creating for its expression a new symbolism, a new art . . The architect should study nature, the human figure, geometry and music, because in all these things he is still studying architecture, the architects of the world and the soul . . . for his purpose of observation [should be] directed towards the discovery of those simple yet subtle occult laws which determine form and structure, such as the tracing of the spiral line, not alone where it is obvious, as in the snail's shell and the ram's horn, but where it appears obscurely, as in the disposition of the leaves or twigs upon a parent stem.\" While direct European influences are not dis cernible on the Griffins before the turn of the century, other influences absorbed from their colleagues around them are: Bragdon being one, for example, on sacred geometry. It would appear, too, that the Griffins' interpretation of the crystal metaphor stem med from Louis Sullivan's theory of tran- scendental ornament. Louis Sullivan was a key fi gure in the promotion of spiritual concerns as a design force in architecture in Chicago during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Transcendentalist ideals, modelled on European Romanticism and philoso- phy, combined with the writing of the Amer ican poet Walt Whitman, formed the basis of his theoretical stance. Menocal points out that for Sullivan 'the function of architec- ture was exclusively to expr ess the transcendental essenc e of a building as eloquently and as characteristically as life is revealed in the sweeping eagle in his flight'.\" The key in this design process was the role of ornament. Based on organic and geometrical forms, Sullivan's idiosyncratic ornament s ought a unification of the rational with the spiritual in order to become a medium by which the spectator could transcend the restrictions of the physical plane and ente r a spiritual communion with nature. Light- splintering ornament in metal and glass on the facades of Sulliv an's buildings became symbolic of a metaphysical representation of the creation of the universe. 26 Sullivan was given heroic status by Ma rion and Walter Griffin: throughout the Magic of America he is lauded as the 'founder of cr eative thinking in modern architec- ture'. Most important of all, Walter is de scribed by Marion as th e true successor to Louis Sullivan. It is probable that, through him, they were indirectly introduced to the work of the German transcendentalists and in dividuals such as Paul Scheerbart. A num- ber of Sullivan's ideas were modified by th e Griffins: his 'natural thinking' was con- verted into the Griffins' 'creative thinking' . Like Sullivan, the Griffins sought a truly 'Democratic architecture' (imbibed from the ideas of Walt Whitman), achievable only through an expression of the 'laws of nature '. Sullivan's interpretation of the creative principle of nature, labelled the 'Inscrutable Serenity' — 'a hidden power, mysterious and serene, qualifying impercep tibly both growth and decaden ce' — is modified later, in the Magic of America by Marion as the 'chemical ether'. 27 As Menocal notes, Sullivan considered that his ornament was: "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"a correlation of geometry and the organic, . . . the basis of nature's method of compo- sition and that consequently, it had a tran scendental essence. By adopting a method of composition that portrayed the two forces (the masculine and feminine/geometrical and organic) on which all creation depended, Sullivan made his work a reflection, or perhaps an extension of the transcendent, generative processes w ith which Inscrutable Serenity sustained the universe.\" The sociologist Herbert Spencer had similar id eas but in his case 't he crystal' became 'the perfect manifestation of natural laws — common minerals gr owing into perfect geometrical shapes'. Marion and Walter Griffi n's use of the crystal metaphor as sym- bolic of the underlying genera tive and creative processes of nature recalls Spencer's ideas. Reflection and refraction, iridescent mountain forms, crystal iconography in the architecture and the plan itself controlled by the sacred geometry of the Vesica suggest that the initial plan for Canberra was, sym bolically, a direct ex pression of a unique, personal cosmogony. An early but more abstruse representati on of the crystal an d its associations with transcendentalism was also available to the Griffins through Besant and Leadbeater's Thought Forms. 29 In this it was proposed that thoughts are manifest on the "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"xbe sycouoLiscn of roe CRYSTAL  81 mental and astral planes as well as on the phy sical plane. Significantly, the book pro- vided a number of fully coloured and expe rtly rendered illustrations of a number of thought-forms,- in particular, a blue-white prism crystal, and another of the same form radiating intense light, both pr ojected as expressive of de votion and pure thought (fig- ure 5.7). Following the tradition of crystal iconography, the explanations to the illus- trations clearly establish a link between th e crystal form and the spiritual movement thought possible between natura l and supernatural planes. The first illustration is explained as a spire of highly developed devotion which leap s into being before us. This is no uncer- tain half formed sentiment,- it is the outru sh into a manifestation of a grand emotion rooted deep in the knowledge of fact. . . The second illustration, developed from the first, is described as the result of His thought in the response of the LOCOS to the appeal made to Him, the truth which underlies the highest and best pa rt of the persistent belief in an answer to a prayer. . . . On every plane of His solar system our LOGOS pours forth His light, His power, His life and naturally it is on the higher planes that this outpouring of divine strength can be given most fully. Th e descent from each plane to that below it means an almost paralysing limitation, a limitation incomprehensible except to those who have experienced higher possibilities of human consciousness. Thus the divine light flows forth with incomp arably greater fullness on the mental plane than on the astral,- . . . Yet there are conditions under which the grace and strength peculiar to a higher plane may in a measure be brought down to a lower one and be spread around with a wonderful effect. This is only possibl e when a special channel for a moment is opened,- and that work must be done below and by the work of man. It has therefore been explained that whenever a man's thought or feeling is se lfish, the energy which it produces moves in a close curve, and thus inevitably returns and expends itself upon its own level. But when the thought or feelin g is absolutely unselfi sh, its energy rushes forth in an open curve, and thus does not return in the ordinary sense, but pierces through into the plane above because only in that higher condition, with its additional dimension, can it find room for its expansion. But thus in breaking through such a thought or feeling holds open a door (to speak symbolically) of a dimension equiva- lent of its own diameter and thus furnis hes the requisite channel through which the divine force appropriate to the higher plane can pour itself into the lower with marvel- lous results. 30 There is clearly a commonality of ideas in the works of Louis Sullivan, Besant and Leadbeater and, later, Marion Griffin in the Magic of America. Marion, at least, must have been influenced by Thought Forms, as well as Sullivan's theory- She refers to the 'etheric realm' and the 'chemi cal ether', terms used by Besant and Leadbeater,- and her treatment ( i n the 'City and Environs' drawing, see figure 1 . 1 ) of Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain and Mugga Mugga as crystalline, yellow, glowing balls of light, perhaps an 'astral' representation of mountain forms, is strikingly similar in style and technique to their 'thought-form' renderings. This provides further evidence of the Griffins' early "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"involvement in Theosophy and of that move ment's widespread influence on artists and architects. 31 The idea of transcendence as integral to the structure of the plan is most clearly reflected in the siting and design of the Capitol building (see figures 2.4 and 4.3). At the epicentre of the composition it is described in the 'Original Report' as; a general administration structure for popul ar reception and ceremonial, or for housing archives and commemorating Australian achie vements rather than for deliberation or counsel,- at any rate representing the spiritu al head, if not the actual working of the Government. 32 The notion of a tower as symbolic of the meeting between spirit and nature was used frequently at the time by figures such as W B Yeats, Pamela Colman-Smith, Arthur Edward Waites and in the mystical Rosicr ucian organisation of the Golden Dawn. 33 The tower, enshrining the spirituality of ph ilosophers and mystics, became a recurring image in the poetry of Yeats. As early as 1900 Yeats wrote of the tower as a 'very ancient symbol through which the spiritual kno wledge was made manifest in the abun- dance and depth of nature'. In the 'Chymical Marriage of Christian Rosenkreutze', a primary Rosicrucian/alchemical text us ed by the Golden Dawn, to which Yeats belonged, the tower is a symbol of the cycles of pain and personal sacrifice necessary for spiritual development and purificati on. In the Rider-Waite Tarot card deck, designed by Waite and illustrated by Colman-Smith, the tower is represented as earth- bound with the poten tial for spiritual revelation. Th e card depicts a tall, elongated fortress atop a rocky crag, its pinnacle crumbling under the impact of a lightning bolt, and its two human resi dents tumbling head- "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" of nature'. The placement of the eagle with outstretched wings recalls a sculpture by W R Lethaby in the Eagle Insurance Building of 1900: the symbolism can be explained as follows: At the centre of the earth ... for the story . . . was told that to determine the true cen- tre of the earth, Jupiter sent out two eagles, one from the east, the other from the west, and they met at this spot. As Julian Holder notes, the idea of the tower symbolism is similarly expressed in Lethaby's writing on the Perfect Temple (see figure 5.9). The Grif fins' Capitol can be viewed in this context. The four square enclosure at the top of the world mountain, where the polar tree or column stands, and whence i ssue forth the four rivers. From the thought of such an enclosure we get. . . our word 'paradise'. 36 A GENERATOR OF FORMS The significance of th e crystal metaphor to the Canberra initial plan is not limited to the ideas of transcendence and transmuta tion. Marion and Walter also saw it as a medium which could liberate Louis Sullivan's 'generative processes of nature'. This is expressed in the geometry of the plan (as de scribed in chapter 1): its internal organisa- tion being derived from the sacred geometry of the Vesica, which liberates the square, the equilateral triang le, the rhombus, the hexagon an d the octagon — al l of which are key figures in the design. Th e rectangle which determines the centres of the two for- mal basins also emerges from the Vesica and is projected from the common base of the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"equilateral triangles. The arc of the northern foreshore of the central form al basin has as its centre the Capitol while the plan geom etry is extended to th e peripheral areas of the central city and unified by means of hexagons and octagons organised along meridians radiating from Capital Hill. Walter Griffin's comment that 'the importance of such an orderly arrangement is very great and can only be appreciated from a city of great heights' reveals that an abstracted geometrical clarity and order was a crucial objective irrespective of the experience on the ground. 37 In many ways, the City and Environs drawing can be interpreted as an abstract composition based on a symbolic, geometrical language of the square, the circle and the triangle,- a language that under- pinned much of the developm ent of modern abstract art. 38 Each of these forms — circle, triangle and square -— has a specific symbolic function within the iconographic tradition emanating from sacred geometry. The circle has always been a symbolic representation of the heaven s, the spiritual and the un- manifest form of the cosmos. In alchemical symbolism the circle stands for the spiritual property of matter whereas the square repres ents the physical prope rties of matter, the earth and man's relation to it. The progression or transmutation from the circle-triangle to the square can be interpreted as symbolising the processes of creation in the cosmos or nature and also of the fo rmation of crystals. This concept of the 'geometrical' con- struction of the crystal seems to be based on an esoteric in terpretation which, at that time, was undergoing a revival through Theosophy. The triangle is also a form which has a rich and arcane symbolism, as observed earlier. In Christian ic onography it represents the Holy Trinity and in other religions is a common symbol for the Godh ead. In material terms, wh ich concerned the Griffins, the triangle was representative of the active and inactive forces of creation: in alchemi- cal terms, the triangle with apex upwards — active — is the symbol for fire,- and with the apex downwards — inactive — it is the symbol for water. In The Ancient Science of Geomancy Nigel Pennick notes that when two equi lateral triangles are joined base-to- base, The disparate elements of the universe can be said to be reintegrated into the primordial whole'. This combination co nstitutes the fundam ental order of the Canberra plan. Therefore, in geomantic terms as interpre ted by Pennick, the geometry of Canberra, emanating from the Vesica, can be regarded as an abstract expression symbolic of the processes of creation underl ying the order of the universe, the trans- mutation of the spiritual into the p hysical constituents of the universe. Without consideration for scale, the Canbe rra plan can be perceived as a series of interrelated circles, triangles and square s/rectangles or, put an other way, it repre- sents the transmutation of the circle to the triangle to the square. The circle is para- mount in the Capital Hill ge ometry with the th ree interconnections producing a dou- ble Vesica (see figure 2.1). In the original design it is repeated in the three formal basins while, on a more subtle plane, it permeates the total design derived from the original Vesica. The orifice contains the equilateral tria ngles base-to-base, the nodal points being Capital Hill, City Hill, Mount Pleasant and Mount Ainslie. The square is derived from the cardo-decumanus crossing of the land and wa ter axes, that is, the quar- tering of the plan. As Walter Griffin appr eciated, from a good elevated vantage point such as Mount Ainslie or Black Mountain, th e design can be perc eived as an abstract"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"x\\ye sycDBoUscn of T !? G CRYSTAL 85 progression from the circle (Capital Hill), to the triangle {parliamentary triangle), to the square (the land an d water axes). This sense of tran smutation is reinforced by the hexagonal and octagonal street systems throughout the plan as these forms flower from the circle, triangle and square. A PERSONAL COSMOGONY Some influences on the Griffi ns can be summarised thus. The concept of the 'mascu- line' and 'feminine' principles of creation are an integral part of Louis Sullivan's notion of 'transcendental ornament', derived from Swedenborgian influences. Crystal icono- graphy is a common aspect of German Romantic theory (Nietzsche and Goethe) and was taken up at the turn of the century by a number of European 'Radicals' such as Berlage and Behrens. At the same time, the crystal metaphor formed a vital role in the 'evolutionary' theory put forward by Herbert Spencer and this overlapped with certain aspects of Theosophical doctrine. In the Magic of America Marion writes: The warm ether manifests itself in Spheres. We glimpse here the origin of the solar system — nothing but the warmth conditi on of matter, the manifestation of the warmth force . . . The Life ether manifests its elf in the rectangles and squares . . . this is the form of the human blood crystals a nd also of the solid earth, though erosion has rubbed off the corner of the primeval form. 39 These influences then seemed to coalesce with sacred geometry, number and propor- tion, which formed an integral part of the Theosophical 'Wisdom Tradition', and was applied to architectural problems by writers such as Claude Bragdon with whom the Griffins had personal contact. 40 This great diversity of influences on the Griffins deter- mined their philosophy and shaped the plan. Throughout the Magic of America Marion refers to a geometrical system which underlies nature. Spirits conceived life in the triangular and the sphere. Goethe sensed this. . . . this is creative thinking. We learn that there are as many universes as there are crystalline forms created by the great primal spirits of mathematics. The Vegetable kingdom transfers the spirit of Matter, mathematics to life, the ether shapes the leaves from the circular to the triangular. ... it takes the great primal spirits of mathematics to create the crystals — the uni- verse. 41 The new religions that appeared around the turn of the century were responsible for reviving, and spreading, knowledge of the ancient orders and ancient practices of early cultures. Elements of these religions would have revealed, however indirectly, to the Griffins that the scholars and mystics of these early cultures possessed a sacred canon which formed the basis of their model of reality. For the ancients, it regulated the "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"86 S€CR€T PLAN Of CAKIOCRRA cosmos and controlled all as pects of life — language, numbe r, music, geometry, archi- tecture, even political organisation. When Mari on talks of 'the great primal spirits of mathematics' which created 'the crystal — th e universe', it seems to be a direct refer- ence to this ancient cosmic canon, which had a mathematical basis. Walter believed that: In town planning as in architecture there mu st be a scheme the mind can grasp, and it must be expressed in the simplest terms possible. Just as music depends on simple mathematical relations so do ar chitecture and town planning. 42 And this suggests that such a model was c onsciously incorporated into their work through the 'Wisdom Tradition'. Annie Besant explains Theosophy as the continuation of this tradition. The Wisdom Tradition has been handed down in all civilised countries ancient and modern. . . . It underlies many of the Chines e systems, especially Taoism. . . . It is found in Egypt in the Book of the Dead, and the papyri from which its religion has been constructed; it appears in the fragmenta ry records of Assyria and Chaldea: in the Gathas and other scriptures of the Parsis: in Hebrew scriptures as expounded in the Kabbalah and the Talmud: in the Christian as treated by the early fathers of the church and by the gnostic writers such as Vale ntinus, Basilides and a host of others,- in Pythagoras and Plato, with the Pythagorean , Platonic and Neo-Platonic schools, with Plotinus, Iamblichus and Theurgists: it is taken up from the doctors of Islam and Sufi mystics; it appears in the Rosicrucian stude nts of alchemy and astrology . . . all of these and scores more have assimilated a nd handed on the Wisdom Tradition. It has lent symbols in Masonry, and hidden some of its mysteries in Masonic ceremonies: it peeps out of Scandinavian and Celtic folklo re, out of Hawaiian le gends and Maori tra- ditions, the unburied temples of the Mayas and the Quicha s, the magic of the Zunis and other North American Indian tribes. 43 Other texts of the time were explicit as to how the sacred cosmic canon controlled the massing and proportions of ancient monuments. In Maya/Atlantis: Quern Moo and the Egyptian Spinx, le Plongeon demonstrates cosmogonic concepts ordering the sacred edi- fices of the Mayas (see figure 5.10), especially the pyramids, which were symbolic of Cod in the universe, and wr ites that the Mayas were: mathematicians, astronomers, artists, navigato rs . . . familiar with plane and spherical trigonometry . . . they had computed the si ze of the earth, estimated the distance from pole to pole, calculated the length of the meridian. In their sacred buildings they invariably embodied their cosmogonic and religious conceptions, particularly in their pyramids. The several parts of these edifices were so arranged and proportioned as to agree with the ratio of the diameter to the circumference 11 pi = [3 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 5 = 14] the sum of which, 2 X 7 [14], was a numerical that, to the Maya initiates, as to all the occultists in ot her parts of the world, represented the cir- cumscribed world — the earth. 44 "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"It seems clear that in the initial plan for Ca nberra and its architecture the Griffins made visible a system of geometrical forms and proportions encapsulating their personal cos- mogony; a 'religious' interpretation of space, of the city as the 'ideal'. The geometry lib- erated from the sacred Vesica, the squa ring and quartering of the city by the cardo-decumanus structure, and the creation of 'sacre d' mountains, all attest to this. 45 The hierophanic function of the Capitol crowne d with the winged eagl e further reinforces the cosmic imagery. In 1912 the implicit symbolism of the plan could only be under- stood by those familiar with the sophisticated language of forms derived from the 'Wisdom Tradition' and the esoteric,- that is , 'by the initiated, or by those who in some way had developed the se nsitivity of the soul to occult truth: a hidden symbolism, and by those who spoke a very spec ial language of the spirit'. 46 As Roger Lipsey describes it: Many promising men and women across Europe and America . . . were to be found in the lodges of the Th eosophical Society hear ing for the first time about the path of inner consciousness and wisdom of the East , but, as they matured into prominence would speak little of it. 47 The extent of Theosophical in fluence on the Griffins is un clear during th e early period in Chicago- Walter was possibly a Freemason at this time. By the 1940s however, when writing the Magic of America, Marion openly expresses the importance of the mystical and the esoteric for Walter and herself in the early years. She frequently refers to Canberra as the 'only true modern city — Alpha-Omega': as a city designed by 'cre- ative thinking' and one that revives the 'anc ient science', even t hough nothing was said of the esoteric nature of the scheme at the "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"and glowing mountains, depi cted ancient geomantic sym bols? And could he have realised that the 'Original Report', which accompanied the drawings and presented the scheme only as an amalgam of Garden City and City Beautiful pr inciples, veiled the true 'cosmic' significance of the scheme? There were many around Alfred Deakin of a like mind. 48 The plan for Canberra expresses the co ntinuity of the cosmic symbolism between Europe and Asia. In broad terms, for both the East and the West, the circle symbolises heaven,- while the cross, and it s related form, the square, symbolises the earth. As Graham Pont has pointed out in 'The Circle and the Cross: Genesis and Hermeneutic of the Traditional Cosmology', these two signs have played a very stable role in the cosmic symbolis m and geometry of sacred building and the planning of cities: from Babylon to Peking, Borobudhur, Angkor Wa t, Benares and Mandalay, in the East,- and in the West, from Athens and Rome to the many European cities derived from them, whose design has been derived from axial orders. 49 The cosmic geometry also informs all Islamic mosques, gardens and tomb complexes like the Taj Mahal. Among the monumental civilisations of the Az tecs, Incas and Mayas, as well as the tribal cultures of the North American Indi ans, there is indisputable evidence of a related cosmogony. A common, cohe rent and complex system of thought and practice underlies certain fundamental conceptions in a ll of these societies, - they are linked by what appears to be a common filiation of ideas or mythical logic. The last city which reflects this system of ideas and to be de signed in the grand or cosmic manner was Canberra.

Afte r seven years of hagglin g over the composition of the plan with politicians and public se rvants, he left Canberra, not having supervised the erection of a single government building and with only a few roads, cut- tings and embankments under construction. Si nce 1920, the urbanistic or geomantic component of the plan has been progressive ly diminished in importance. Canberra is now a landscape-dominated city, where public buildings such as the High Court and the National Gallery are faceted and fragmented and displayed like incidental artworks in an immense picturesque garden. Walter and Marion Griffin's axial and geomantic meridians can be discerned but the vistas are interrupted by recent irregu lar landforms and large-scale tree planting (see figure 6.1). Canberra garden city — the geomantic city subsumed — is the result of counter- proposals to the monumental component of the Griffins' plan, first by federal capita l advisory committees chaired by Sir John Sulman and Sir John Butters following Griffi n's departure from Canberra, and then by the English town planning consultant, Sir William Holford, who favoured the 'pic- turesque'. This trend was continued through the policy of the National Capital Development Commission, which appointed proponents of naturalism and the 'pic- turesque', mostly Englishmen, to control both the landscape and architecture divisions from 1958. The construction of the new Parliament House — with the building articu- lated under Capital Hill, leaving 85 per cen t of the site available for landscaping — represents the ultimate phase of the 'pic turesque' garden idea l for Canberra. When fully realised, tree growth will obscure the ge ometrical clarity of the Parliament House. No monumental construction has been allowed to impinge on the idea for a National Place, which is intended as a vast, levelled and grassed pl aza, 500 metres wide, extend- ing from the Parliament House to the shores of Lake Burley Griffin. In Canberra now, open space is celebrated and ensh rined as symbolic of a nati onal ideal, the antithesis of the geomantic character of th e initial plan. Elsewhere the opposite prevails,- in new capital cities, such as Chandigarh, Brasil ia, New Delhi and Washington, monumental constructions' form the substanc e of the design. This chapter will seek to illuminate the background to this Australian singularity and appreciate its cultural significance. The forecourt to the new Parliament H ouse, which extends from the National Place, is intended by its creators to symbolis e the Australian desert but this is very dif- ferent from the democratic symbolism and ideal ism that the Griffins illustrated in the initial Canberra plan. Walter Griffin who desc ribed himself as a 'r adical democrat' was a disciple of Henry George and his philosophy was also influenced by the democratic ideals of Walt Whitman and those of his me ntor, Louis Sullivan. In Chicago he had seen Australia as a Utopia, where the people of 'a vast potentially productive undevel- oped insular continent' cherished 'the highest standards of human rights'. 1 The formal and axial component of the plan in the cent ral triangle emanates from Griffin's view of Australia as: a democracy already in the vanguard of poli tical progress setting a standard for the entire world in its struggle agai nst private monopoly and exploitation. 2 W"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"In the Centre of Administration of Affairs, the Parkway and the Public Gardens and in the central triangle comprisi ng judicial, legislative and executive functions, with the Capitol as a climax, Griffin arranged th e elements of government, symmetrically placed on terraces about the land axis, to express in symbolic terms his conception of constitutional democracy. 3 In the vertical dimension, the bicameral Parliament House is placed on Camp Hill above departmental and judicial functions. This composition is focussed on the Capitol, at the highest level, conceived by Griffin as a place of popular assembly, a forum, a repository for the national archives and an institution commem- orating national achievements — th e focus of national consciousness. The 'Garden City' componen t of the initial Canberra plan emanated from another aspect of Walter Griffin's philosophy: an appreciation of nature. At the time of the competition he stated that 'I am what may be term ed a naturalist in architecture . . . I believe in architecture that is the logica l outgrowth of the environment in which the building in mind is to be located'. 4 In the addresses to the architectural institutes of New South Wales and Victoria, given shortly af ter his arrival in Australia, Griffin eulo- gised nature and the Australian landscape. 5 He had already written in his first Report Explanatory of the Preliminary General Plan that: The internal blocks, typically large . . . leave opportunity for private development or small-community initiative to evolve pretty schemes of driveway subdivision, recessed courts, closes, quadra ngles, terraces, common gardens, irregular hill garden subdivi- sions, and a host of similar possibilities addi ng incident and variety to a consistent whole. 6 By 1915, Griffin was drawn further toward s the Garden City ideal: he wrote of Letchworth in England, which was also divided into areas of separate functions, as a population of 'happy, healthy and contented people living in an ideal surround'. 7 THE 'PUBLIC AND 'PRIVATE' CITY Walter Griffin's democratic idealism and his pursuit of an organic naturalism are both expressed in the initial plan for Canberra: the former is the expression of the 'public' city and its connection to the City Beautiful; the latter liberates the 'private' city of suburban orientation. City Beautiful rhetoric was concerned with civic design rather than social functions and advocated aesthetic architectu ral planning with a ground composition of monumental buildings, grand pi azzas and sweeping vistas connecting park land to the civic centre. The initial plan had responded to this principle but with excessive separa- tion of the key elements and nodal points, which was conditioned by geomantic con- siderations. Civil servants an d bureaucrats remained implacably opposed to the exces- sive costs implicit in the ultimate realisatio n of the plan. This story is well-known. No one in Australia came to a ppreciate the democratic sym bolism of Walter and Marion Griffin's plan or any of the ancient paradi gms from which it was generated. The com- petition entry was essentially an outline presented in a manner so as 'to force the "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"emphasis of the underlying ideas' but Walter did not prepare a more detailed exposi- tion of his ideals after 1 9 12 . 8 Directly related to axes generated from surrounding hills and mountains and also derived from ancient megalithic paradigms, the nucleus of the initial plan, the par- liamentary triangle and its projections, are of heroic proportions. Here, the Griffins concentrated upon the creatio n of a clear geometric order both in axiality and in the sculpturally separate and solid monumental constructi ons within the government group of public buildings. This component of the Canberra initial plan can be viewed as an expression of the 'public' city: a ci vic and urban symbol. The freer and more modest areas and precincts comprising the Ga rden City component of the plan can be viewed as an expression of the 'private' city of suburban orienta tion and provincial val- ues, where the Griffins avoided the fixed climax of Beaux Arts baroque vista planning. The forms are not linear a nd axial but capable of endl ess extension spiralling from polygonal matrices. Both these components also derive fro m ancient paradigms, whose continuities into our own times Walter and Marion Griffin expressed in Canberra through a matrix derived from a philosophi cal tradition which sought to relate the forces of the earth and the cosmos. The picturesque ethos and the panorami c prospect, on the other hand, crys- tallised in the Canberra plan, contained a whole range of metaphors, the legacy of the eighteenth century, which ensh rined and symbolised politi cal thought and ethical and moral ideals. These ideals were such as could be felt and responded to by modern indi- viduals: politicians or public officials, and private individuals — in the public and the private spheres. During the eighteenth century in England there had been a connection between politics and art, especially in landscape and landscape art. Correct taste in these art forms was used in th is period, and thereafter, as a means of legitimising politi- cal authority — the claim to participate in the councils of state. Writers of the polite culture of this period conclude that political authority is rightly exercised by those capable of generalised thought, of producing abstract ideas out of the raw data of experience. Two kinds of landscape are represented in eighteenth and nineteenth century painting and literature. 9 The first is the ideal, panoramic prospect, the analogue of the social and universal,- this is surveyed, orga nised and understood by disinterested public individuals. Such people regard the elements of the landscape always as representative ideas, intended to categoris e rather than deceptively to imitate their originals in nature,- they study, not the objects themselves — not, for example, an individual per- son in a society, or their individual occupa tions — but their relations. Public individu- als are enabled to do this by their ability to abstract and by their ability to compre- hend and classify the totality of human experience. 10 In this sense they assume the mantle of the augurs and priests of antiquity who practised the principal arts of civilisa- tion — architecture and planning included — as part of their duties or office. Just as in ancient Egypt, for instance, the priests had practised monumental civic design and geometrical planning, or in Rome the traditi on of civic design referred back to the rites and observances of th e Etruscan priesthood. 11 "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"96 secRex pLiw op C ANBERRA Secondly, there is the occluded landscape . Such landscapes conceal the gen- eral view by concealing the distance. Imagery characterist ic of occluded landscapes could be a cottage embosomed in trees that pe rmit the distance to appear only as spots or slices of light. This genr e represents the confined view s of the private individuals whose experience is too narrow to permit them to abstract. In England, these two kinds of landscape were ofte n, if not always, assumed to be the productions of, and designed for, the entertainment of two diffe rent spheres of life — the public and the private — and even of two different classes of people. The representation of panoramic prospects serves as an incidence of the ability of an individual of liberal mind to abstract the general from the particular. It was also understood to be an incidence of that person's ability to abstract the true interests of humanity, the public interest, from the la byrinth of private interests which were thought to be represented by mere unorganised detail. In republican political theory a citizen, a public individual in this sense, had long been distinguished by the fact that this ability was a function of this person's reason. The power to abstract, as metaphorised ever ywhere in the power to comprehend and organise an extensive prospect, is a testimon y of the ability to prefer and to promote an art which itself promotes the public interest. 12 By contrast, private men who were not citizen s, who were servants or mechanics, had been understood from Ar istotle onwards to have no ability to under stand reason, or to follow anything but their own immediate instinct s. According to this system of classifi- cation the representation of the ideal, panora mic landscape is an instantiation of the political capability of the public i ndividual. In Britain, in the eighteenth and ninet eenth centuries, idea l, panoramic land- scape was treated as a public genre and acco rded that status by an aesthetic philoso- phy. 13 The connection between art and the pub lic sphere had insisted on the inter- dependency of the republic of taste and the political republic; and it has given explanatory power to th e writing of the times. Ancient axial orders and geomantic pa radigms underlie the City Beautiful matrix, which was structured in relation to man-made termini, towers, large obelisks and fountains, controlled by the principles of baroque vista planning. The panoramic prospect evolved in England and reached its apotheosis in the work of Capability Brown and Humphrey Rept on. These two spheres merg ed in the picturesque work of Frederick Law Olmsted in America, in which axial arrangements were utilised but using mountains and hills as 'natural' term ini. The Griffins' Canberra plan was, in part, coalesced from these identifiable English, European and American influences: it was underpinned by 'picturesque' theory in Uvedale Price, Essay an the Picturesque (1794), and Richard Payne Knight, Analytical Inquiry into the Principles of Taste (1805)."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"GARDEN CITY INFLUENCES The Garden City ideal can be related to contemporaneous urban environmental ideals in England and America through Walter Griffin' s clear references to it both before and after the Canberra competition. Before World War I the Garden City ideal had seemed to fuse piecemeal improvements into a comp rehensive model,- but, internationally, in the period of postwar reconstruction, it was seen only as a par tial interpretation of planning procedures, chiefly with potentia l for residential application. During the 1920s the general course of planning theory was in fluenced by Am erican City Functional models. These models adopted a pragmatic appro ach to make the best of existing cities in all their complexity,- ur ban renewal, traffic flow, land-use zoning and the provision of tech nology and services became the dominant planning paradigms. This largely weakened the nexus between residential planning and housing reform from which the Garden City move ment had gained its strength. In international te rms, the Garden City ideal had peaked in popularity around 1910, following the publication of Ebenezer Howard's Garden Cities of Tomorrow in 1901. But in Australia, the Garden City ideal cr ystallized more slowly and its solvation was slower than elsewhere. The depression of the 1890s brought an abrupt end to the ebullient fantasies of Marvellous Melbourne of the 1880s. In Sydney, too, the old values were shaken in every field, the old politics were discredi ted. The early Town Planning movement in Australia, concerned primarily with social welfare and policies related to housing, health and recreation, reflected the new political id ealism but it was not until the end of World War 1 that a unifi ed movement materialised. 14 Both New South Wales and Victoria sent strong delegations to the 1917 Australian Town Planning conference in Adelaide, which was well-attended by politi cians and local govern ment officials and many international visitors, including the infl uential English Garden City theorist and planner, Charles Reade. Walter Burley Gri ffin gave the keynote address, in which he reiterated his naturalistic idealism and its relevance to Canberra- The most characteris- tic note was struck by the governor of Victoria, Sir Arthur Stanley: Town planning is not a panacea for social evils, but at leas t it can be said that if healthy, happy surro undings are given for people to li ve in they are given a better chance to be a happy, contented co mmunity growing up in the state. 15 Housing reform was stimulated by the conclu sions of an overseas investigation, which dealt with the English garden cities, by J C Morell, the architect for the Victorian Department of Public Works. He argued th at, while Melbourne wa s better placed than were the cities of the Old World, the pres ent haphazard me thods could not be allowed to continue: They do not pr ovide for maximum health conditions, they are not eco- nomic, and they are not progressive'. 16 By the end of World War I there existed in Australia a concerted town planning policy di rected towards the pr ovision of adequate housing, social amen ities, and open space and landscap ing, consistent with English Garden City principles."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"In the Canberra plan between 1912 a nd 1918 the suburban residential areas show the most significant changes on the plan s prepared by Griffin as federal director of Design and Construction. The interstices of the stellar fingers and the steeper slopes were drawn with free road patterns on larg e blocks. Later, with the land for domestic construction freed from constraints and under government control, Canberra responded comprehensively to the subur ban building boom of the 1920s which affected all the Australian capital cities. After Griffin had departed from Canberra, the Federal Capital Advisory Committee advocated that, without precluding the ideal of the fe deral capital as a beautiful city, utilitarian de velopment and economy should be the aim . . . leaving to future decades — perh aps generations — the evolution of the National City on lines that are architecturally monumental'. 17 The chairman of the Advisory Committee, the English expatriate architect a nd town planner, Sir John Sulm an, was one of the earliest proponents of Garden City design. He was president of the Town Planning Association of New South Wale s from its inception in 191 3, Vernon lecturer in Town Planning at the University of Sydney, where he also controlled th e architecture course until 1912, and he was an influe ntial consultant to the R oyal Commission on the devel- opment of Sydney and its suburbs (1909). In his book. An Introduction to Town Planning in Australia (1921), published well after the Garden City movement had declined in England and America, Sulman discussed Letchworth as a modern Hygeia, which offered fresh air, sunlight and uncrowded living conditions. Written in the same year, under the parameters advocated by Sulman, the First Gentral Report on the Development of Canberra stated that: the Committee conceives Canberra as a Ga rden Town with simple, pleasing but unpretentious buildings — mostly single stor ey — planned, nevertheless, to afford adequate comfort and reasonable convenienc e in which legislative and executive gov- ernment will be carried on, with the population accommodated, some in well built and suitably disposed cottages of permanent c onstruction, others in hostels, designed to meet their needs . . . 18 FROM GARDEN CITY TO THE 'PICTURESQUE' Sir John Sulman and his Advisory Committee did nothing to support the urbanistic component of Griffin's plan: the geomantic Ci ty Beautiful or 'public' city. The Garden City character would permeate even the central triangle according to Sulman. The Report spelt the beginning of the end for the co mpetition-winning plan with its propos- als for monumental structures set on spaci ous terraces framed by axial avenues along Beaux Arts baroque vistas. An influential consultant to the Advisory Committee was Professor Leslie Wilkinson, who practised picturesque-eclecticism in both architecture and civic design. He came from England in 1919 to take the first chair in architecture at Sydney University. Havi ng immediately formed a stro ng liaison with Sulman, he was appointed to the National Capital Planning Committee, which sited both the "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"eclectic art-deco War Memori al and the Administrative Of fices of George Sydney Jones contrary to Griffin's intentions. 19 The original and grand prop osals for the 'public' city fared little better under the Federal Capital Commission, chaired by Sir John Butters after 1925. A few streets were laid out and the cottages for 35,000 i nhabitants were served by a small shopping area with arcades in the early Italian Rena issance style designed by J S Murdoch, the chief architect for the federal Department of Works. Conrad Hamann has noted that these arcades in Civic Centre , although solemn and delicately handled, really ignored the task of designing a federal capital an d intensified the imag e of Canberra as a provincial country town in a garden setting. 20 By 1927, the white-painted, stucco, provisi onal Parliament House, its siting vehemently opposed by Griffin even afte r he had left Canberra, faced the War Memorial across almost two miles of paddoc ks, where sheep grazed. Framing the cen- tre, the outlines of the extensive plan, the re sult of Griffin's prog ramme of road cut- tings and embankments, carried out betwee n 1917 and 1920, were di scernible. They had been supported by an ambitious programme of tree planting but, ironically, it was the extension of this work, developed ov er a period of two decades from 1930, that helped to further erode the axial order of the plan. The Griffins ' distinction between parkland on the outer reaches being wild, an d in inner areas formalised, was irrevoca- bly lost. The vast tree-plan ting exercises destroyed cohe sion by allowing elements of the plan to be considered independently, relying on landscaping to solve all the prob- lems arising from poor visual relationships. In 1955 Prime Minister Robert Menzies expressed concern about the lack of development in Canberra. Menzies, an angl ophile and monarchist, did not form close personal relationships and was aloof to the point of disdain, distancing himself from colleagues. Richard Clough, formerly the h ead of the landscape division of the National Capital Development Commission (N CDC), recalls that Menzies's influence on plans for Canberra's development was br ought to bear throu gh John Button, the head of the prime minister's department. Bu tton had close ties with John Overall, later to become the first Commissioner for the National Capital Deve lopment Commission (they played billiards togeth er each Saturday morning). Clough also ob serves that Menzies had a penchant for landscape art and admired the work of the Heidelberg School. He was favourably disposed towards the idea of a 'bush' capital and apparently appreciated the potential of the bush mystique as representative of Australianness in much the same way as the picturesque tradition was projected by conservative interests as symbolic of English culture. John Fi tzhenry, an architect working with the Australian Broadcasting Co mmission and in conjunction with the NCDC during its formative period, recalls that Dame Pattie Me nzies also took an interest in Canberra's development. She was most concerned that Northbourne Avenue, the main road into Canberra from Sydney, should be sensitiv ely developed with houses discreetly shielded by gardens and landscaping. Resulting from Menzies's concerns, a Se lect Committee of the Senate, with Senator J A McCallum as chairman, was a ppointed to inquire and report upon the development of Canberra- The report contained seventy-si x recommendations,- it was "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"100 SeCKGT PLAN Oe CAWB€KKA thorough and persuasive, drawing on eviden ce gleaned from a large number of wit- nesses. After a comprehensive study of the history of Canberra, the misfortunes of Walter Burley Griffin and the lack of achi evement in building the capital, the commit- tee gave Griffin's plan a full vote of confidence. The more one studies Griffin's plan and his explanatory statements, the more obvious it is that departures from the main principl es should not be light ly countenanced. The principal features of Griffin's plan should be maintained at all costs. It is a grand plan and something we should hold on to.\" The committee included in their Report Griffin's original 'Report Explanatory', his plans of 1 9 1 2 , 1913 and 1918 as well as the gazetted plan of 1925. The government appeared to accept the direction proposed by the Select Committee of the Senate and established the National Capital Development Commission with wide powers of con- trol. But, while Griffin's plan was paid lip-ser vice, it is likely that Robert Menzies inter- ceded, exerting pressure to follow an Englis h town planning model for Canberra rather than the European and American model implicit in Griffin's design. 22 The English architect and town planner William Holford was consulted. In his 'Observations on the Development of Canberra, A.C.T.' presente d on 15 May 1958, Holford reviewed the past forty years and suggested 'Necessary Am endments' to Griffin's plan {see figure 6.2): it seems necessary to amend the formal symmetry of the Griffin plan and to retain it only for those features where it can be really effective, leaving a balanced but not sym- metrical development to take its place on either side of the central axis. Further on s t i l l , a frankly picturesque treatment woul d be more in keeping with the beautiful background of hill and valley which the exis ting suburbs and the wider landscape of the Australian Capital Territory provide. 23 In the light of history, present possibilities and 'amendments that will in any case have to be made to the original plan', Holford discussed two approaches to the development of Canberra: either to remain a divided city, with the flood plain of the Molonglo as an open wedge between the federal town on the south bank and the municipality on the north or 'to become a unified city, metropolitan in character if not in size, a cultural and administrative centre, and a national capi tal'.\" Holford strongly favoured the sec- ond course and outlined three objectives, concluding that 'it is possible to envisage the future of Canberra as a true capital combin ing the functions of a garden or landscape city, a fully motorised town and a cultural centre'. 25 Canberra is already a city of gardens . . . One hopes that it will remain so ... the maintenance of a garden character in the resi dential parts of the city is more important than raising the density. 26 Canberra generally postdates World War II and its character, especially that of its five satellite centres, is primarily influenced by the British 'New Town' planning movement. "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"What happened in Canberra, in the wider sphe re, is not very different from what was happening in the more or less homogeneous middle-c lass cities around the world: Toronto, Vancouver, Portlan d, Reading, and the ol der Australian citie s, from Floreat Park in Perth to Doncaster-Templestowe in Melbourne. The origins of this new town movement are too complex to describe here but the new towns certainly incorporate elements of the Garden City — in particular, the use of a green belt to separate city zoning. William Holford was in the vanguard of the new town movement in England; his conclusions and recommendations for the development of Canberra embodied these principles which, at the time, represented a strong er city planning model. The American City Functional approach was cl early irrelevant. Holford applied Garden City and 'picturesque' princi ples for the proposed developm ent of the central areas and these resonated with the poten tial of the site and the exis ting garden character of the city. 27 However, his 'picturesque' proposals for the permanent Parliament House and the water basins were major departures from Walter and Marion Griffin's intentions. The creation of the lake and the ornamental basins was recommended but Holford suggested 'a slight reduction in th e size and formality of the latter' for no stated reason. 28 He argued that: At the same time, the proposed basins at Canberra must, in my view, act as a unifying feature and not a disrupti ve one. The West Lake, on the other hand, magnificently framed by the contours . would hardly act as a barrier and could be a wonderful recreational and natural shape. 29 The implementation of these proposals by the disciples of Holford and the 'pic- turesque', through the agency of the Na tional Capital Development Commission, has undermined the realisati on of the formal geometry of Gr iffin's lake system. The care- fully articulated, arcuated shorelines were a crucial element in the initial plan and re- inforced the symmetrical displacement of th e monumental structures in the south, in the'central triangle, and those related to form al parkland to the north of the lake. Like John Sulman, thirty-five years before, Holfor d could not grasp the aesthetic principles of Griffins plan: the arrangement of elem ents relating to the axes generated from Bimberi Peak, Black Mountain and Mount Ainslie, the regular polygonal geometry emanating from th e crystalline or stellar patterns and the distin ction between distant and inner-city landscaping. The NCDC was given Holford's 'Obser vations' for comment. Contravening the previous direction towards the implementa tion of Griffin's plan as outlined in the Report of the Select Committee of the Senate, the NCDC endorsed Holford's approach and the sketch plan he provide d with only minor modi fications. Concerning the siting of the perm anent Parliament Hous e, Holford had written: My own choice of site for the permanent Parliament House would be in the centre of the axis rather than at one end of it. As it is, the axis is too long and too uneventful to register any marked impression on the beholder ... Its climax would be at the centre. Paris or Versailles would have replaced Washington as the model. 30 "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The 1923 Parliamentary inquiry into the erec tion of the provisional Parliament House had opened a Pandora's box of opinion and sp eculation concerning the nature and sit- ing of the provisional building and also what might follow as a permanent Parliament House. Walter and Marion Griffin's choice of site for the pe rmanent building was Camp Hill but a plan prepared by J S Murdoch for the permanent structure on Kurrajong, or Capital Hill , planted the seed which has recently flowered. But, in 1958, with no site officially proclaimed, and with R C Menzies domi- nating the gover nment of the day, little concern wa s expressed when Holford's pro- posal was promulgated. Parliament House w ould be embedded in a picturesque setting, near the southern lake shore, and in a manner akin to the great English country houses such as Blenheim Palace or Castle Howa rd. In fact, the model was not Paris or Versailles, as Holford cont ended, but a Capability Brown landscape- Seeking to dis- tance itself from past speculation concerning the use of Camp Hill or Capital Hill for the Parliament House site, and to justify the use of the lakeside site, the NCDC stated in a 1958 report that: A rather misleading impression of the import ance of Capital Hill as a building site is given by the paper plan of Canberra and it should be noted that although its visibility is good from the Queanbeyan side, from the Triangle it cannot be seen at all. 31 It was conveniently forgotte n that the Griffins had propo sed a massive Capitol crown- ing Capital Hill which could have been seen from anywhe re. For a decade, from 1958 to 1968, the Parliament House site, terraced and marked with giant flagpoles, was exhibited at the northern en d of the parliamentary zone. Master plans set the National Library and the High Court flanking the Pa rliament House with a vast landscaped court (now the National Place) separating the proposed new building and the existing provisional building. In this scheme, only the Treasury (1970) and the Library (1968) were constructed on the sites indicated. Although the new Parliament House has been constructed on Capital Hill,-the widespread acceptance of Ho lford's 'picturesque' model further submerged the geo- mantic City Beautiful, the 'public' city proposed by Grif fin. From the early 1960s, a succession of appointees from England, mostly disciples of William Holford, systemat- ically furthered naturalism and the 'picture sque' in Canberra's ce ntral areas. Gareth Roberts was Holford's protege from the Univer sity of Liverpool and John Haskell came from his office in Brighton. They, with Roge r Johnson, were successive directors of the Architecture Division of the NCDC. Ri chard Clough, the NCDC director of Landscape until 1981, was trained as an archit ect and imbibed 'picturesque' principles from Leslie Wilkinson at Sy dney University. Clough's e xperience in landscape was gained in England under his mentor Sylvia Crowe, who had absorbed elements of the English Free Style in landscape from th e Arts and Crafts movement via Edwin Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll. Richard Clough, in particular, changed Griffin's proposals for the lake. He substituted free forms for large sections of the shorelines and empha- sised irregularity in much of the foreshor e planting, thus intens ifying picturesqueness, and he placed the carillon and the waterspo ut so as to accen tuate asymmetry and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"1O4 SeCKCT pLAW Of: CAMBCRRA informality. When interviewed, Richard Clough expressed the view that Walter Burley Griffin's axial arrangements were, in reality, 'ineffective'. This succession of individuals, who subscr ibed to 'picturesque' principles of landscape design, had eroded th e Griffins' concept for Canberra even before the design of the new Parliament House on Capital Hill was settled. The Mall, in the par- liamentary zone, and Anzac Parade attempt fo rmality but the former relies only on inconsequential patterns of tr ees, and the latter is limited to a narrow strip of the land axis unsupported on the norther n lake shore. There, accord ing to the Griffins, regular landscaping and institutional buildings should have created a formal viewing platform for the government group. With the omissi on of the causeway, the wetlands area bleeds into East Basin with no design purpose. There are no successful formal parks; the parklands along the entire lake frontage have been designated picnic and recre- ation amenity. Griffin had proposed variety and a gradation of treatment in order to make the parklands support the wider city patterns. In the parl iamentary zone, the hierarchy of capital functions proposed by Griffin has been fragmented with govern- ment offices, municipal offices, national inst itutions and local func tions distributed at random in the areas abutting the Mall. In 1968, after Robert Menz ies had quit politics and anti-conservative forces were in the ascendancy, the House of Repr esentatives supported a proposal to move the site of the propose d Parliament House to Camp Hill. This re quired the demolition of the existing Parliament building, a pr oposition not supported by the Senate, which viewed the old building, with its threefold exte nsions, as a perman ent fixture. This impasse prevailed until 1974 when, at a hist oric joint sitting of both houses of Parliament, the Parliament Act located the projected Parliament House on Capita! Hill and designated the parliamentary zone, in which all building proj ects became subject to parliamentary approval. An internati onal architectural competition was held in 1979. The first prize was awarded to the Amer ican-based firm, Mitchell, Giurgola and Thorp; their scheme, with minor modifica tions but escalating co sts as construction proceeded, was completed for the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. While paying false homage to Walter and Marion Griffin and their visionary plan, politicians and public figures alike have discarded the most significant compo- nents of that plan an d disregarded the aesthetic princi ples critical to its implementa- tion. The picturesque capital of Australia is largely the manifestation of conservative idealism generated from an English background. The 'public' city, a civic and democra- tic symbol, is now only the dream of a few ideologues. Canberra has become the expression of private individuals, who have vacillated between the frantic desire to find something comprehensible to belong to, an d an equally consumi ng passion to act on their own.

"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"he new Parliament House by the Italia n-American architect Romaldo Giurgola responds both to the matr ix established by the Gri ffins and to the existing Canberra architectural order that results from the developments after the Griffins' departure (see, for instance, the co mparison in figure 5. 4). It would appear from his writing and intervie ws, however, that Giurgola is largely unaware of the ancient regime to wh ich he is responding. By extending and refining the geomanti c principles underlying the original plan, Giurgola has aligned Ca nberra with the most potent of ancient paradigms. The great ramped hemicycles embody the 'dragon' forms of feng shui. They form protective arms to the east and the west (the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger), while the fore- court enclosure rises to its peak at the so uthern end and tapers down to ensure an unobstructed view north to Mount Ainslie. As in the ideal feng shui arrangement, too, there is a quiet 'heav en pool' in the foreground (the fo recourt pool), with a slow-mov- ing body of water in the distance. The ramps also refer to the great curved and ramped constructions of the ancient world, such as Palestrina, near Rome, and the theatre-tem- ples along the cardo from Anzio to Tivoli. The re-crea tion of Capital Hill as a 'natural' element identifies the new building with sole mn observances and ancient orders. As in the Greek city, where the city form is seen against the sacr ed mountain, the elevations of the new Parliament House are profiled unde r the curvature of the re-stated hill (see figure 7.3). Externally, architectura l monumentality has been exorcised in the new Parliament House by Romaldo Giurgola. Ca pital Hill has been removed and then restated in the form of the two ramped, landscaped hemicycles . The parliamentary functions have been articula ted in a labyrinth suppressed in a landscaped park. Instead of the solid monumental bulk of Griffin's Capitol, Giurgola's design provides an open frame supporting a flag mast. The volume enco mpassed by this open frame is roughly the same as Griffin's solid constr uction atop the Capitol (figure 7.1). According to our design 85 per cent of the s ite is intended to be devoted to landscape, most of which is available to the public. Rather than being an imposition on the site, the Parliament building is generated by the natural state of the land configuration, just as democratic government is not an imposition on the community but rather originates organically from w ithin the populace. 1 Giurgola's justification for his approach to the design of the new Parliament House centres on what he considers to be the correc t relationship of architecture with nature in the context of Canberra. Th rough historical insi ghts into the 'trans fer' of geometry into nature, as represented by the Italian and French gardens, and the 'alternative view by which naturalness of the organic forms extends within architectural episodes, as in the English landscape', Giurgola claims that he is able to view Canberra as 'a post- industrial artefact'. In his writing he constructs parameters upon which the 'in between built forms and land forms' become a 'natural assumption'. 2 Giurgola argues that his design adheres to the Griffins' principle for the Capitol. As the trees planted on the Hill parkland grow up, however, there is a grave T"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" Triangle which every Australian would have the right to enter'. 4 Whatever credibility can be given to Holford's 'Versailles' mode l, the 'forum' proposed for the people com- prised only an open forec ourt and parkland. The acceptance of the approach by Holford that the Canberra order required an anti-monument stimulated Giurgola's response that 'the Parliament building is ge nerated by the natural st ate of the land con- figuration'. Giurgola, too, propos ed parkland 'which is avai lable to the public' as a kind of forum. Canberra, tragically, has no place or piazza or forum. In fact, landscaped, open space is the very antithesis of the forum in Western culture. Traditionally the forum is at the very heart of judicial, parl iamentary and executive functions of a soci- ety. How feeble are the proposals for th e nucleus of the pa rliamentary zone by Holford, and those ensuing from the Na tional Capital Development Commission, when compared with the Griffins' vi sion of a genuine forum — the Capitol: a general administrative structure for popul ar reception and ceremonial, or for housing archives and commemorating Australian achieve ment, rather than for deliberation or counsel,- at any rate, representing the sentime ntal and spiritual head if not the actual working mechanism of the Government of the Federation. 5 The geometry of Canberra has been previous ly elucidated and is summarised here in order to explain the form of the new Parl iament House. The nucleus of the plan, derived from the Vesica, comprises two equ ilateral triangles whose common base is the Municipal Axis with Mount Ai nslie and Capital H ill as the apex of each triangle. The "},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"110 secRex pLaw of CAWOCRRA . centres of the formal basins are derived from the square projected from the Municipal Axis, and the profile of the northern foreshores of the lake is an arc with the Capitol as centre. In the initial pl an the sites dete rmined for the Ca pitol and its subsidaries, the prime minister's residence a nd the governor-general's reside nce, are also derived from the geometrical construction of the Vesica. In the new Parliament House, Roma ldo Giurgola has carefully placed the major elements of th e Senate Chamber and the House of Representatives Chamber in the same relationship to the crossing or axis mundi (the present flagpole) as did the Griffins with the siting of the residences for the prime minister and the governor-gen- eral (see figure 7.3). The pagoda-like, pyramidal Capitol, the explicit axis mundi of the 'democratic' temple within the 'magic' circles of th e hill was, to the Griffins, symbolic of Canberra as caput mundi, an imagery reinforced by th e avenues radiating from the axis mundi: Sydney, Perth, Melbourne. The fla gpole is the equivalent of the omphalos, the concept of the build ing seen as the imago mundi (image or map of the world). The same process of consecrati on is implicit in the notion of the templum of concentric circles, which the Griffins designated for the univers ity (see figure 3.5) . Furthermore, the geometry of the ramped hemicycles is deri ved from the Vesicas of three intersecting circles implicit in the circular geometry of Capital Hill in the initial plan. Giurgola has, therefore, responded both to the 'picturesque' and to geomantic orders by moulding the massing and profiles to the Griffins' matr ix. Additionally, like the Griffins, he also searches to express the underlying character of the place — Canberra's genius loci. THE SEARCH FOR THE GENIUS LOCI Whereas Greek thought was anthropocentr ic and Greek architecture anthropomor- phic, the Italic peoples from ancient times sought the genius loci for ritual and worship. The perception of the spirit of the place was the core of desi gn in architecture, ideally the concretisation of that spirit, thus a meaningful structure for human use. 6 For exam- ple, at Nemi, Diana the huntress was first worshipped within a sacred grove by the lakeshore, the theatre-temple being constructed later. The recognition of th is ancient paradigm permeat es Giurgola's writing on the new building. By gathering in significant asp ects of Australian culture — references to society and its history — w ithin the architectural desi gn and decorati ve programme, Giurgola attempts to endow the building with a hierophany, 'a wonderful accretion of connotations confluences and connections ma king it richer and deeper rather than a mere arid group of structur es with a specified function' . This concept, by which the building is considered as an agglomeration of many im portant symbo lic elements, introduces the idea of the spiritual plane. 1 believe places and buildings not only have a physical existence, but are capable of having an important spiritual or cultural existence which is considerably enlivened and expanded by the role that particular place has been given in our society. 7 Akin to Marion and Walter Griffin's proposal for the Capitol in the initial plan, the new Parliament House is intend ed to 'personify' the essence of the Australian 'spirit'. It "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"rr>e wew PAR L IAXDEMT bouse  111 is, then, a phenomenological metaphor, in which Giurgola's sense of 'place' mirrors the Greek notion of Logos, meaning, simultaneously: location, place, point, order, reason, underlying principle and explanation, amongst numerous attendant meanings. 8 Thus, the building is projected as charged with symbols which evoke the Australian ethos at various levels. This notion is evident in the architectural, craf t and art programmes, where temporal and spatial themes dominat e the movement along the north-south axis tracing our history from the Aboriginal dreamtime (Michael Tjakamara Nelson's mosaic in the forecourt) through to Europ ean settlement (the Foyer and the Great Hall) and to the present (Executive Committ ee Room). The sense of temporal progres- sion is reinforced by the use of contrasting ma terials: ancient natural materials such as marble, granite and timber juxt aposed with contemporary ma terials such as concrete and glass. Symbolic of Australia's constituti onal and political history, the east-west axis connects the Senate Chamber, the Members' Hall and the House of Representatives. Through its architectural symbolis m and i t s art pr ogramme, the new Parliament House becomes, at one level, an explanation and justific ation of the archi- tect's attempt to reveal the 'spirit' of the nation in the design. 9 But this is not the com- plete story, for a deeper sens e of symbolism permeates the design. That is to say, a sense of the chthonic forces of nature — the symbolism of the mountain and the cave — which stems from the constructions of th e ancient world, in particular the Roman Campagna and the architecture of the ancient city. The ne w building is distinguished by a strong inferiority, exhi biting the same basic themes of enclosure and axiality which, from the beginn ing, characterised the centralised and longit udinal structures of ancient Rome — the Thermae and the Pantheon — and were evident in the first churches built under Constantine and in the great Roman church es thereafter. The exterior was given little emphasis except for th e main facade, being conceived as a neu- tral shell around a richly articul ated interior. The mass is given a priori and the classical orders are applied only in a public place or in a dome, whic h rises up as a fully articu- late bodily form and signals the urban pres ence of the values symbolised by the church. Giurgola is of Italian descent and the new building expresses the strong con- nections that he has always had wi th Rome,- he is responding to the genius loci not of Canberra but of Rome. In 'Genius Loci of Rome' Christian Norburg-Schulz writes: Through an analysis of the landscapes of Latium we ma y therefore arrive at the needed explanation of the genius loci of Rome, of its various components and their interaction. 10 He identifies the 'strange, \"sunken\" valleys' of Etruria, where continuous walls of golden-brown tufa close in 'idyllic' spaces , as the truly 'local ' component of its genius. Originally the site of Rome had this ch aracter; the seven hills we re not really hills but a series of crests between bl ind valleys along the Tiber. Th e Etruscans built their vil- lages on the crests and used the sides of such valleys fo r tombs and cellars. Ancient Rome followed this pa ttern and its importanc e was recognised in that the altar dedi- cated to the genius loci was placed immediatel y under the steep tufa rock of the Palatine Hill. 11 The different lands cape of the Alban Hills has already been mentioned: 'Here,"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"112 secReT pL*.w op CIWB 6 RR 2 I the gods of Antiquity are at home' writes Norburg-Schu lz, and the natural forms enshrining Jupiter, Juno and Diana are in f act distinguished by a 'Greek clarity and presence'. Thus, Rome is situated between two different worlds: to the east the classical landscape of the gods and to the west the chthonic world of the forre. Around Rome, keeping both worlds at a certain distance, is the Campagna proper, which creates a 'pause' before the man-made synthesis of the city. 12 From earliest times Rome possessed this double spatial structure: the vernacu- lar cluster of settlements with roots in the earth , which came to cr eate the 'idyllic' enclosure of the urban spaces,- the abstract axis of symmetry, which made the city the focus of a more comprehensive totality. The combination of th ese two components creates an axially ordered encl osure, a particular kind of architectural unit, which may be considered as the basic element of Roman architecture. The fo ra, thermae, sanctuaries, palaces and atrium houses of Rome are, literall y, axially ordered en closures; as such, they conserve a certain independence within the urban totality. Not assimilated by any superior geometrical system, they are accumu lated like the individual buildings of the classical Greek settlement. Thus, the third fundamental property of Roman space emerges — the classical image of an environment consisting of distinct, individual places. But there is a distinction: whereas the Greeks in their settlements added plastic 'bodies', the Romans used spaces as units. Rome forms the centre of a landscape which contains 'eve rything'. The old chthonic forces are present in the underworld of the forre and the Alban Hills rise up and contain the anthropometric characters of the classical gods; between these, under the abstract and cosmic order of the sky w ith the sun, these meanings become manifest as an exceptionally rich and varied en vironment on the Campagna which accommo- dates everyday life. In an active symbolisat ion of the various m eanings, the world of the forre is reproduced in the streets and piazze of the city and the gods are seemingly brought down from the h i l l s to the urba n temples. The role of Rome as caput mundi is undoubtedly determined by its natural situation but this gathering is not simply the result of the central location of the city. Dynamically, th e gods extend their influence to the whole environment as in no other place. This synt hesis of the ch thonic and the classical is the essence of the Roman ethos, in which cl assical forms appear on the facades and in the courtyards of the houses to 'humanise' the 'natural' structures. 13 As Norburg-Schulz rema rks, The power and ve rsatility of the Roman genius loci has throughout history given the architecture of the ci ty a unique self-assurance and grandezza'. The cosmic dimension, the cardo-decumanus scheme giving rise to the cardi- nal directions, gives man a general foothold in a mutable world and became the natural symbol of the Roman Empire,- and it concretise s the belief in a general cosmic har- mony behind all things. The distinctly Roman synthesis became complete with the incorporation of the ca rdinal points in all the main building types. In Canberra Walter and Marion Griffin established parallels with ancient para- digms, particularly Greek models, but also with Eastern ones arising from ontological similarities. 14 In an interview discussion about this most recent phase of Canberra's development, Romaldo Giurgola indicates that he recognises the reach by the Griffins for the genius loci."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Although Walter Burley Criffin had been brought up with the ideal of the Garden City, he envisioned much more in designi ng the plan for Canberra. He saw it as a symbolic place, an art form which could su rvive only if it strictly but harmoniously related to the configurations of the surrounding land. In conceptual terms a genius loci developed and evolved for the city plan accord ing to two principles,- first, the organi- sation of the site into a number of specific and functional places and,- second, a tri- dimensional perception of the site which included landform, the landscape with its flora and fauna, and the architecture. The similarity between this attitude and the city form of the Classical world is apparent. [emphasis added] In the new Parliament House design, Giur gola sought to conc retise the in-dwelling spirit of the nation as the Gr iffins had attempted to do in the original design for the Capitol building. By reiterati ng the shape of Capi tal Hill in the ge neral mass of the building, Giurgola infused his design with metaphorical asso ciations such as perma- nence and stability, and, in the Roman sense, enclosure and interiority. The Great Verandah is intended to recall a distinctiv ely Australian architec tural element; in fact, the austere facade of marble and granite f acing recalls the rock-hewn tombs of Roman Petra and those of Egypt but in a stylised romantic-classic mode This 'megalithic' monumentality is present in the exposed ex terior surfaces of th e building, where the rock-like masonry is punctuated with smaller openings as if carved or chipped into the face. The marble and granite concentrations of cubistic forms and the primary arrange- ment of verticals a nd horizontals also recall megalit hic forms as at Stonehenge. A microcosm of the 'dragon' imagery of feng shui; the sweeping curves of the great ramped hemicycles reinforce the paradigm of the mountain and the cave,- their convex curves channel movement through the Great Verandah to the interior Foye r and there is a clear-cut distinction between exterior and in terior space. From the Foyer, no visual relationship can be established with the outside landscape as masses of marble and granite ar e piled up, symbolical ly interpreted in Australian terms as a metaphor for the eucalyptu s forest. This 'inferiority', which char- acterises the Foyer, can be felt within the major spaces of the Parliament House. In a literal sense, the building can be perceived as a series of enclosed spaces ,- like the Italian piazze, of introverted squares. A clear view of the city is never given but — in keeping with the Italian tradition — the sky can be clearly seen from courtyards which frequently have fountains or sculpture at their centres (see figure 7.2). The forre of the prehistory of Rome, re born in its streets an d squares, spring inst antly to mind,- but in the new Parliament House these 'piazze' are framed by tautly stretched facades with a linear and planar clarity, and a machined sharpness as well. In Rome significant architectural units are axially ordered enclosures and Romaldo Giurgola parallel s this effect in the new buildi ng. Each area can be perceived as a separate space,- yet the cardo-decumanus system unifies the build ing. The cross-axial arrangement is clear externally but it can al so be felt covertly, fr om views of the flag- pole, the explicit axis mundi, which are presente d from within. The dialectical rela tionship between enclosure and axis is the fundamental theme during the histor y of Roman architecture, runni ng from the Pantheon and the early Christian basilicas to Michelangelo's St Peter, and the high baroque interpreta-"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" the roof lantern is positioned exactl y above the north-sou th and east-west (cardo-decumanus) crossing and the cr ossing is emphasised by a re flective fountain pool. Thus, the enclosure of the hall, with its robust wooden columns, is penetrated by a vertical axis mundi projected from the conspicuous flag pole that symbolically links the earth with the heavens and marks the central mundus. Externally, the pyramidal shape of the flagpole can be interpreted as a tribute by Giurgola to the Griffi ns' original inten- tions for Capital Hill and the hierophanic fu nction of the proposed Capitol. Akin to the concept of the Pantheon, the new Parliame nt House symbolically reflects the cos- mic order: the cardo-decumanus relationship indicates the four corners of the earth and the quartering of the city, and Canberra as caput mundi — the geomantic expression of the microcosm in the macrocosm (see figure 7.3). By alluding to the scale and architectural character of the surrounding build- ings such as the High Court, the provisi onal Parliament House and the nearby impos- ing Administrative Offices, Giur gola has placed the keystone in the arch of Canberra and made a connection between the ancient paradigms and the actual world. And his design has made the Griffins' macro-landscape resonate with some of the most power- ful symbols of Western culture. In the Colo sseum and the Pantheon, the urban foci of Rome, anthropomorphic orders and cosmic ax es are unified in the simplest possible way. The synthesis becomes symbolically present in the urban man-made environ- ment.
