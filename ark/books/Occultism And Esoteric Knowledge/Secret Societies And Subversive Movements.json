But the state of the world at the end of the Great Wa r seemed to demand an enquiry into the present phase of the revolutio nary movement, hence my attempt to follow its course up to modern times in World Revolution. A nd now before returning to that first cataclysm I have felt impelled to devote one more book to the Revolution as a whole by going this time further back into the past and attempting to trace its origins from the first century of the Christian era. For it is only by taking a general survey of the movement that it is possible to understand th e causes of any particular phase of its existence. The French Revolution did not ar ise merely out of conditions or ideas peculiar to the eighteenth century, nor the Bo lshevist Revolution out of political and social conditions in Russia or the teaching of Karl Marx. Bo th these explosions were produced by forces which, making use of popular suffering and discontent had long been gathering strength for an onslaught not only on Christianity, but on all social and moral order. It is of immense significance to notice with wh at resentment this poi nt of view is met in certain quarters. When I first bega n to write on revolu tion a well-known London publisher said to me, \"Remember that if you take an anti-revolutionary line you will have the whole literary world against you.\" This appeared to me extraordinary. Why would the literary world sympathize with a movement which from the French Revolution onwards has always be en directed against literatu re, art, and science, and has openly proclaimed its aim to exalt the manual workers over the intelligentsia? \"Writers must be proscribed as the most dangerous enemies of the people,\" said Robespierre; his colleague Dumas said all clever men should be guillotined. \"The system of persecution against man of talents was organized. . . . They cried out in the sections [of Paris], 'Beware of that man for he has written a book! `\"(1) precisely the same policy has been followed in Russia. Under Moderate Socialism in Germany the professors, not the \"people,\" are starving in garrets. Yet the whole press of our country is permeated with subversive influences. Not merely in partisan works, but in manuals of history or literature for use in schools! Burke is reproached for warning us against the French Revolution and Carlyle's panegyric is applauded. And whilst every slip on the part of an anti-revolutionary wr iter is seized on by the critics and held up as an example of the whole, the most glar ing errors not only of conclusions but of facts pass unchallenged if they happen to be committed by a partisan of the movement. The principle laid down by Collot d'Herbois still holds good: \" Tout est. permis pour quiconque agit dans sens de la révolution.\" All this was unknown to me when I first em barked on my work. I knew that French writers of the past had distorted facts to suit their own politica l views, that a conspiracy of history is stil l directed by certain influences in the Masonic lodges and the Sorbonne; I did not know that this conspi racy was being carried on in this country. Therefore the publisher's warning did not daunt me. If I was wrong either in my conclusions or facts I was prepared to be challenged. Should not years of laborious 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"historical research meet e ither with recognition or with reasoned and scholarly refutation? But although my book received a great many generous and appreciative reviews in the press, criticisms which were hostile took a form which I had never anticipated. Not a single honest attempt was made to refute either my French Revolution or World Revolution by the usual methods of controversy; statements founded on documentary evidence were met w ith flat contradiction unsupported by a shred of counter evidence. In general the pl an adopted was not to disprove, but to discredit by means of flagrant misquotati ons, by attributing me views I had never expressed, or even by means of offensive person alities. It will surely be admitted that this method of attack is unparalleled in a ny other sphere of l iterary controversy. It is interesting to notice that precisely th e same line was adopted a hundred years ago with regard to Professor Robison and the Abbé Barruel, whose works on the secret causes of the French Revolution created an immense sensation in their day. The legitimate criticism that might have been made on their work find no place in the diatribes levelled against them; their enem ies content themselves merely with calumnies and abuse, A contemporary American writer, Seth Payson, thus describes the methods employed to discredit them: The testimony of Professor Robison and Abbé Barruel would doubtless have been considered as ample in any case which did not interest the prejudices and passions of men against them. The scurrility and odium with which they have been loaded is perfectly natural and what the nature of th eir testimony would have led one to expect. Men will endeavour to invalidate that evid ence which tends to unveil their dark designs: and it cannot be expect ed that those who believe th at \"the end sanctifies the means\" will be very scrupulous as to th eir measures. Certainly he was not who invented the following characte r and arbitrarily applied it to Dr. Robison, which might have been applied with as much propriety to any other person in Europe or America. The character here referred to, is taken fr om the American Mercury, and printed at Hartford, September 26, 1799, by E. Babcock. In this paper, on the pretended authority of professor Ebeling, we are told \"that Robison had lived to fast for his income, and to supply deficiencies had undert aken to alter a bank bill, that he was detected and fled to France ; that having been expelled the Lodge in Edinburgh, he applied in France for a second grade, but was refused; that he made the same attempt in Germany and afterwards in Russia, but ne ver succeeded ; and from this entertained the bitterest hatred to mas onry ; that after wandering about Europe for two years, by writing to Secretary Dundas, and presenting a copy of his book which, it was judged, would answer certain purposes of the mi nistry, the prosecutio n against him was stopped, the Professor returned in triumph to his count ry, and now lives upon a handsome pension, instead of suffering the fate of his predecessor Dodd.(2) Payson goes on to quote a writer in The National Intelligencer of January 1801, who styles himself a \"friend to truth \" and speaks of Professor Robison as \" a man distinguished by abject dependence on a part y, by the base crimes of forgery and adultery, and by frequent paroxysms of insanity.\" Mounier goes further still, and in his pamphlet De l'influence attribuée aux Philosophes, . . . Francs-maçons et . . . Illuminés, etc., inspired by the Illuminatus Bode, quotes a story that Robison suffered from a form of insanity which consisted in his believing that the posterior portion of his body was made of glass !(3) In support of all this farrago of nonsense th ere is of course no foundation of truth; Robison was a well-known savant who lived sane and respected to the end of his 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"days. On his death Watt wrote of him: \"He was a man of the clearest head and the most science of anybody I have ever known.\" (4 ) John Playfair, in a paper read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1815, whilst criticizing his Proofs of a Conspiracy --though at the same time admitting he had hi mself never had access to the documents Robison had consulted--paid the following tribute to his character and erudition: His range in science was most extensive; he was familiar with the whole circle of the accurate sciences. . . . Nothing can add to the esteem which they [i.e. \" those who were personally acquainted with him \"] felt fo r his talents and worth or to the respect in which they now hold his memory.(5) Nevertheless, the lies circulated against both Robison and Barruel were not without effect. Thirteen years later we find a nother American, this time a Freemason, confessing \" with shame and grief and indignation \" that he had been carried away by \" the flood of vituperation poured upon Barruel and Robison during the past thirty years,\" that the title pages of their works \" were fearful to him,\" and that although \" wishing calmly and candidly to investigate the character of Freemasonry he refused for months to open their books.\" Yet when in 1827 he read them for the first time he was astonished to find that they showed \"a manifest tendency towards Freemasonry.\" Both Barruel and Robison, he now realized, were \"learned men, candid men, lovers of their country, who had a reverence for truth and religion. They give the reasons for their opinions, they quote their authorities, naming the au thor and page, like honest people; they both had a wish to rescue British Masonry from the condemnation and fellowship of continental Masonry and appear to be sincerely actuate d by the desire of doing good by giving their labours to the public.\"(6) That the author was right in his descripti on of Barruel's attitude to Freemasonry is shown by Barruel's own words on the subject: England above all is full of those upright men, excellent citizens, men of every kind and in every condition of life, who count it an honour to be masons, and who are distinguished from other men only by ties which seem to strengthen those of benevolence and fraternal char ity. It is not the fear of offending a nation amongst which I have found a refuge which prompts me to make this exception. Gratitude would prevail with me over al l such terrors and I should say in the midst of London \"England is lost; she will not escape the Fr ench Revolution if the Masonic lodges resemble those I have to unveil. I would even say more: government and all Christianity would long ago have been lost in England if one could suppose its Freemasons to be initiated into the last mysteries of the sect.\"(7) In another passage Barruel observes that Mas onry in England is \"a society composed of good citizens in general whose chief object is to help each other by principles of equality which for them is nothing else but universal fraternity.\"(8) And again: \" Let us admire it [the wisdom of England] for having known how to make a real source of benefit to the State out of those same mysteries which elsewhere conceal a profound conspiracy against the State and religion.\"(9) The only criticism British Freemasons may make on this verdict is that Barruel regards Masonry as a system which originally contained an element of danger that has been eliminated in England whilst they regard it as a system orig inally innocuous into which a dangerous element was inserted on the Continent. 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Thus according to the former conception Freemasonry might be compared to one of the brass shell-cases brought back from the battle-fields of France and converted into a flower-pot holder, whilst according to the latter it resembles an innocent brass flowerpot holder which has been used as a receptacle for explosives. The fact is that, as I shall endeavour to show in the course of this book, Freemasonry being a composite system there is some justification for both these theories. In eith er case it will be seen that Continental Masonry alone stands condemned. The plan of representing Robison and Barru el as the enemies of British Masonry can therefore only be regarded as a method for discrediting them in the eyes of British Freemasons, and consequently for bringing the latter over to the side of their antagonists. Exactly the same method of attack has been directed against those of us who during the last few years have attempted to warn the world of the secret forces working to destroy civilization; in my own case even the plan of accusing me of having attacked British Masonry has been adopted without the shadow of a foundation. From the beginning I have always differentiated between British and Grand Orient Masonry, and have numbered high British Masons amongst my friends. But what is the main charge brought agains t us? Like Robison a nd Barruel, we are accused of raising a false alarm of creating a bogey, or of being the victims of an obsession. Up to a point this is compre hensible. Whilst on th e Continent the importance of secret societies is taken as a matter of course and the libraries of foreign capitals teem with books on the questi on, people in this country really imagine that secret societies are things of the past --articles to this effect appeared quite recently in two leading London newspapers--w hilst practically nothing of any value has been written about them in our language during the last hundred years. Hence ideas that are commonplaces on the Contin ent here appear sensational and extravagant. The mind of the Englishman doe s not readily accept anything he cannot see or even sometimes anything he can see which is unprecedented in his experience, that like the West American farmer, confr onted for the first time by the sight of a giraffe, his impulse is to cry out angrily: \"I don't believe it ! \" But whilst making all allowance for honest i gnorance and incredulit y, it is impossible not to recognize a certain method in the ma nner in which the cry of \"obsession\" or \"bogey \" is raised. For it will be noticed that people who specialize on other subjects are not described as \"obsessed.\" We do not hear, for example, that Professor Einstein has Relativity \" on the brain\" because he writes and lectures exclusively an this question, nor do we hear it suggested that Mr. Howard Carter is obsessed with the idea of Tutankhamen and that it would be well if he were to set out for the South Pole by way of a change. Again, all those who wa rn the world concerning eventualities they conceive to be a danger is not accu sed of creating bogeys. Thus although Lord Roberts was denounced as a scaremonger fo r urging the country to prepare for defence against a design openly avowed by Germany both in speech and print, and the Duke of Northumberland was declared to be the victim of a delusion for believing in the existence of a plot against the British Empire which had been proclaimed in a thousand revolutionary harangues and pamphl ets, people who, without bothering to produce a shred of documentary evidence, have recently sounded the alarm on the menace of \" French Imperialism \" and asserted that our late Allies are now engaged in building a vast fleet of aeroplan es in order to attack our co asts, are not held to be either scaremongers or insane. On the cont rary, although some of these same people were proved by events to have been comple tely wrong in their prognostications at the 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"beginning of the Great War, they are still regarded as oracles and sometimes even described as \"thinking for half Europe.\" Another instance of this kind may be cited in the case of Mr. John Sp argo, author of a small book entitled The Jew and American Ideals. On page 37 of this work Mr. Spargo in refuting the accusations brought against the Jews observes: Belief in widespread conspiracies directed at individuals or the st ate is probably the commonest form assumed by the human mind wh en it loses its balance and its sense of proportion. Yet on page 6 Mr. Spargo declares that when visiting this country in September and October 1920: I found in England great nation-wide organizations, obviously well financed, devoted to the sinister purpose of cr eating anti-Jewish feeling and sentiment. I found special articles in influential newspapers devoted to the same evil purpose. I found at least one journal, obviously well financed again, ex clusively devoted to the fostering of suspicion, fear, and hatred against the Jew . . . and in the bookstores I discovered a whole library of books devot ed to the same end. It will be seen then that a belief in wide spread conspiracies is not always to be regarded as a sign of loss of mental balance, even when these conspiracies remain completely invisible to the general public. For those of us who were in London during the period of Mr. Spargo's visit saw nothing of the things he here describes. Where, we ask, were these \"great nation-wide organi zations \"striving to create anti-Jewish sentiments? What were their names? By who were they led? It is true, however, that there were nation-wide organizations in existence here at this date instituted for the purpose of combating Bolshevism. Is anti-Bolshevism then synonymous with \"anti- Semitism \"?(10) This is the conclusion to wh ich one is inevitably led. For it will be noticed that anyone who attempts to expose th e secret forces behind the revolutionary movement, whether he mentions Jews in this connexion or even if he goes out of his way to exonerate them, will incur the hostility of the Jews and their friends and will still be described as \"anti-Semite.\" The realiz ation of this fact has led me particularly to include the Jews in the study of secret societies. The object of the present book is therefore to carry further the enquiry I began in World Revolution, by tracing the course of revolutionary ideas through secret societies from the earliest times, indicating the role of the Jews only where it is to be clearly detected, but not seeking to implicate them where good evidence is not forthcoming. For this reason I shall not ba se assertions on merely \"a nti-Semite \" works, but principally on the writings of the Jews them selves. In the same way with regard to secret societies I shall rely as far as possi ble on the documents and admissions of their members, on which point I have been able to collect a great deal of fresh data entirely corroborating my former thesis . It should be understood that I do not propose to give a complete history of secret societies, but only of secret societies in their relation to the revolutionary movement. I shal l therefore not attempt to de scribe the theories of occultism nor to enquire into the secrets of Freemasonry, but simply to relate the history of these systems in or der to show the manner in whic h they have been utilized 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"for a subversive purpose.

I use the word \" anti-Semitism \" here in the sense in which it has come be used-- that is to say, anti-Jewry, but place it in inverted commas cause it is in reality a misnomer coined by the Jews in order to create a false impression. The word anti- Semite literally signifies a person who adopts a hostile attitude towards all the descendants of Shem--the Arabs, and the entire twelve tribes of Is rael. To apply the term to a person who is merely antagonistic to that fraction of the Semitic race known as the Jews is therefore absurd, and leads to the ridiculous situa tion that one may be described as \" anti-Semitic and pro-Arabian.\" This expression actually occurred in The New Palestine (New York), March 23, 1923. One might as well speak of being \"anti-British and pro-English.\"  8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"CHAPTER I THE ANCIENT SECRET TRADITION The East is the cradle of secret societie s. For whatever end they may have been employed, the inspiration and methods of mo st of those mysterious associations which have played so important a part behind the scenes of the world's history will be found to have emanated from the lands wher e the first recorded acts of the great human drama were played out--Egypt, Babylon, Syria, and Persia. On the one hand Eastern mysticism, on the other Oriental love of intrigue, framed the systems later on to be transported to the West with results so tremendous and far-reaching. In the study of secret societie s we have then a double line to follow--the course of associations enveloping themselves in secrec y for the pursuit of esoteric knowledge, and those using mystery and secrecy for an ulterior and, usually, a political purpose. But esotericism again presents a dual aspect. Here, as in every phase of earthly life, there is the revers de la médaille-- white and black, light and darkness, the Heaven and Hell of the human mind. The quest for hidden knowledge may end with initiation into divine truths or into dark and abominable cults. Who knows with what forces he may be brought in contact beyond the veil? Initiation which leads to making use of spiritual forces, whether good or evil is ther efore capable of raising man to greater heights or of degrading him to lower dept hs than he could ever have reached by remaining on the purely physical plane. And when men thus unite themselves in associations, a collective for ce is generated which may exercise immense influence over the world around. Hence the import ance of secret societies. Let it be said once and for all, secret societies have not always been formed for evil purposes. On the contrary, many have arisen from the highest aspirations of the human mind--the desire for knowledge of eter nal verities. The evil arising from such systems has usually consisted in the perversi on of principles that once were pure and holy. If I do not insist further on this point, it is because a vast literature has already been devoted to the subject, so that it need only be touched on briefly here. Now, from the earliest times groups of Initia tes or \"Wise Men\" have existed, claiming to be in possession of esoteric doctrines known as the \" Mysterie s,\" incapable of apprehension by the vulgar, and relating to th e origin and end of man, the life of the soul after death, and the nature of God or the gods. It is th is exclusive attitude which constitutes the essential difference between th e Initiates of the ancient world and the great Teachers of religion w ith whom modern occultists seek to confound them. For whilst religious leaders such as Buddha and Mohammed sought for divine knowledge in order that they might impart it to the world, the Initiates believed that sacred mysteries should not be revealed to the profane but should re main exclusively in their own keeping. So although the desire for in itiation might spring from the highest aspiration, the gratification, wh ether real or imaginary, of this desire often led to spiritual arrogance and abominable tyranny, resu lting in the fearful trials, the tortures physical and mental, ending even at times in death, to which the neophyte was subjected by his superiors. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE MYSTERIES According to a theory current in occult a nd Masonic circles, certain ideas were common to all the more important \"Mysteries,\" thus forming a c ontinuous tradition handed down through succeeding groups of Initiat es of different ages and countries. Amongst these ideas is said to have been th e conception of the unity of God. Whilst to the multitude it was deemed advisable to preach polytheism, since only in this manner could the plural aspects of the Divine be apprehended by the multitude, the Initiates themselves believed in the existence of one Supreme Being, the Creator of the Universe, pervading and governing all things . Le Plongeon, whose object is to show an affinity between the sacred mysterie s of the Mayas and of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Greeks, asserts that \"The idea of a sole and omnipotent Deity, who created all things, seems to have been the universal belief in early ages, amongst all the nations that had reached a high degree of civilization. This was the doctrine of the Egyptian priests.\"(1) The same writer goes on to say that the \" doctrine of a Supreme Deity composed of three parts distinct from each other yet forming one, was universally prevalent among the civilized nations of America, Asia, and the Egyptians,\" and that the priest s and learned men of Egypt, Chaldea, India, or China \". . . kept it a profound secret and imparted it only to a few select among those initiated in the sacred mysteries.\"(2) This view has been expre ssed by many other writers, yet lacks historical proof. That monotheism existed in Egypt before the days of Moses is, however, certain. Adolf Erman asserts that \"even in early ti mes the educated class\" believed all the deities of the Egyptian religion to be identical and that \"the priests did not shut their eyes to this doctrine, but str ove to grasp the idea of the one God, divided into different persons by poesy and myth. . . . The priesthood, however, had not the courage to take the final step, to do away with those dis tinctions which they declared to be immaterial, and to adore the one God unde r the one name.\"(3) It was left to Amenhotep IV, later known as Ikhnaton, to proclaim this doctrine openly to the people. Professor Breasted has described th e hymns of praise to the Sun God which Ikhnaton himself wrote on the walls of the Amarna tomb-chapels: They show us the simplicity and beauty of the young king's faith in the sole God. He had gained the belief that one God created no t only all the lower creatures but also all races of men, both Egyptians and foreigne rs. Moreover, the king saw in his God a kindly Father, who maintained all his cr eatures by his goodness. . . . In all the progress of men which we have followed thr ough thousands of years, no one had ever before caught such a vision of the great Father of all.(4) May not the reason why Ikhnaton was later de scribed as a \" heretic\" be that he violated the code of the priestly hierarc hy revealing this secret doctrine to the profane? Hence, too, perhaps the necess ity in which the King found himself of suppressing the priesthood, which by persisting in its exclusive attitude kept what he perceived to be the truth from the minds of the people. The earliest European centre of the Mysteries appears to have been Greece, where the Eleusinian mysteries existed at a very early date. Pythagoras, who was born in Samos about 582 B.C. spent some years in Egypt, wh ere he was initiated into the Mysteries of Isis. After his return to Greece, Pythagoras is said to have been initiated into the 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Eleusinian Mysteries and attempted to found a secret society in Samos ; but this proving unsuccessful, he journe yed to Crotona in Italy, wh ere he collected around him a great number of disciples and finally establ ished his sect. This was divided into two classes of Initiates--the first admitted only into the exoteric doctrines of the master, with whom they were not allowed to speak unt il after a period of five years' probation ; the second consisting of the r eal Initiates, whom all the mysteries of the esoteric doctrines of Pythagoras were unfolded. This course of instruction, given after the manner of the Egyptians, by means of images and symbols, began with geometrical science, in which Pythagoras during his stay in Egypt had become an adept, and led up finally to abstruse speculations concerni ng the transmigration of the soul and the nature of God, who was represented unde r the conception of a Universal Mind diffused through all things. It is however, as the precursor of secret societies formed later in the West of Europe that the sect of Pythagoras enters into the scope of this book. Early Masonic tradition traces Freemasonry partly to Pythagoras, who is said to have travelled in England, and there certa inly some reason to believe that his geometrical ideas entered into the system of the operative guilds of masons. THE JEWISH KABBALA(5) According to Fabre d'Olivet, Moses, who \"w as learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,\" drew from the Egyptian Mysterie s a part of the oral tradition which was handed down through the leaders of the Israe lites.(6) That such an oral tradition, distinct from the written word embodied in the Pentateuch, did descend from Moses and that it was later committed to writing in the Talmud and the Cabala is the opinion of many Jewish writers.(7) The first form of the Talmud, called the Mi schna, appeared in about the second or third century A.D.; a little later a comment ary was added under the name of the Gemara. These two works compose the Jeru salem Talmud, which was revised in the third to the fifth century. This later editi on was named the Babylonian Talmud and is the one now in use. The Talmud relates mainly to the affairs of everyday life -- the laws of buying and selling, of making contracts--a lso to external religious observances, on all of which the most meticulous details are given. As a Jewish writer has expressed it: . . . the oddest rabbinical c onceits are elaborated through many volumes with the finest dialectic, and the most absurd questions are discussed with the highest efforts of intellectual power ; for exam ple, how many white hairs may a red cow have, and yet remain a red cow ; what sort of scabs require this or that purifica tion ; whether a louse or a flea may be killed on the Sabbath--the first being allowed, while the second is a deadly sin ; whether the slaught er of an animal ought to be executed at the neck or the tail ; whether the high priest put on his shirt or his hose first ; whet her the Jabam, that is, the brother of a man who died childless, being required by law to marry the widow, is relieved from his obligation if he falls off a roof and sticks in the mire.(8) But it is in the Cabala, a Hebrew word signifying \"reception,\" that is to say \"a doctrine orally received,\" that the specul ative and philosophical or rather the theosophical doctrines of Israel are to be found. These are contained in two books, the 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Sepher Yetzirah and the Zohar. The Sepher Yetzirah, or Book of the Creation, is described by Edersheim as a monologue on the part of Abraham, in whic h, by the contemplation of all that is around him, he ultimately arrives at the conclu sion of the unity of God\"(9) ; but since this process is accomplished by an arrangeme nt of the Divine Emanations under the name of the Ten Sephiroths, and in the permut ation of numerals and of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, it would certainly convey no such idea--nor probably indeed any idea at all--to the mind uninitiated into Ca balistic systems. The Sepher Yetzirah is in fact admittedly a work of extraordinary obscurity(10) and almost certainly of extreme antiquity. Monsieur Paul Vulliaud, in his exhaustive work on the Cabala recently published,(11) says that its date has been placed as early as the sixth century before Christ and as late as the tenth century A.D., but that it is at any rate older than the Talmud is shown by the fact that in the Talmud the Rabbis are described as studying it for magical purposes.( 12) The Sepher Yetzirah is al so said to be the work referred to in the Koran under the na me of the \"Book of Abraham.\"(13) The immense compilation known as the Sepher-Ha-Zohar, or Book of Light, is, however, of greater importance to the study of Cabalistic philosophy. According to the Zohar itself the \"Mysteries of Wisdom \" were imparted to Adam by God whilst he was still in the Garden of Eden, in the fo rm of a book delivered by the angel Razael. From Adam the book passed on to Seth, then to Enoch, to Noah, to Abraham, and later to Moses, one of its principal exponents.(14) Other Jewish writers declare, however, that Moses received it for the first time on Mount Sinai and communicated it to the Seventy Elders, by whom it was ha nded down to David and Solomon, then to Ezra and Nehemiah, and finally to the Ra bbis of the early Christian era.(15) Until this date the Zohar had remained a pur ely oral tradition, but now for the first time it is said to have been written down by the disciples of Simon ben Jochai. The Talmud relates that for twelve years the Ra bbi Simon and his son Eliezer concealed themselves in a cavern, where, sitting in the sand up to their necks, they meditated on the sacred law and were frequently visi ted by the prophet Elias.(16) In this way, Jewish legend adds, the great book of th e Zohar was composed and committed to writing by the Rabbi's son Eliezer and his secretary the Rabbi Abba.(17) The first date at which the Zohar is definite ly known to have appeared is the end of the thirteenth century, when it was committe d to writing by a Spanish Jew, Moses de Leon, who, according to Dr. Ginsburg, said he had discovered and reproduced the original document of Simon ben Jochai; his wife and daughter, howev er, declared that he had composed it all himself.(18) Which is the truth? Jewish opinion is strongly divided on this question, one body maintaini ng that the Zohar is the comparatively modern work of Moses de Leon, the other declaring it to be of extreme antiquity. M. Vulliaud, who has collated all these views in the course of some fifty pages, shows that although the name Zohar might have orig inated with Moses de Leon, the ideas it embodied were far older than the thirteenth century. How, he asks pertinently, would it have been possible for the Rabbis of the Mi ddle Ages to have been deceived into accepting as an ancient document a work that was of completely modern origin? (19) Obviously the Zohar was not the composition of Moses de Leon, but a compilation made by him from various documents dati ng from very early times. Moreover, as Vulliaud goes on to explain, those who deny its antiquity are the anti-Cabalists, headed by Graetz, whose object is to prove th e Cabala to be at variance with orthodox 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Judaism. Theodore Reinach goes so far as to de clare the Cabala to be \"a subtle poison which enters into the veins of Judaism and wholly infests it\"; Salomon Reinach calls it \"one of the worst aberrations of the human mind.\"(20) This view, many a student of the Cabala will hardly dispute, but to say that it is foreign to Judaism is another matter. The fact is that the main ideas of the Zohar find confirmation in the Talmud. As the Jewish Encyclopædia observes, \"the Cabala is not really in opposition to the Talmud,\" and \"many Talmudic Jews have s upported and contributed to it.\"(21) Adolphe Franck does not hesitate to describe it as \"the he art and life of Judaism.\"(22) \" The greater number of the most eminent Rabbis of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries believed firmly sacredness of the Zohar and the infallibility of its teaching.\"(23) The question of the antiquity of the Cabala is therefore in reality largely a matter of names. That a mystical tradition existed am ongst the Jews from remote antiquity will hardly be denied by anyone (24) ; it is th erefore, as M Vulliaud observes, \"only a matter of knowing at what moment Jewish my sticism took the name of Cabala.\"(25) Edersheim asserts that-- It is undeniable that, already at the time of Jesus Christ, there existed an assemblage of doctrines and speculations that were ca refully concealed from the multitude. They were not even revealed to ordinary scholars, for fear of l eading them towards heretical ideas. This kind bore the name of Kabbalah, a nd as the term (of Kabbalah, to receive, transmit) indicates, it represented the spiritual traditions transmitted from the earliest ages, although mingled in the course of tim e with impure or foreign elements.(26) Is the Cabala, then, as Gougenot des Mousseaux asserts, older than the Jewish race, a legacy handed down from the first patriarchs of the world? (27) We must admit this hypothesis to be incapable of proof, yet it is one that has found so much favour with students of occult traditions that it cannot be ignored. The Jewish Cabala itself supports it by tracing its descent from the patriarchs--Adam, Noah, Enoch, and Abraham--who lived before the Jews as a separate race came into existence. Eliphas Lévi accepts this genealogy, and relates that \"the Holy Cabala\" was the tradition of the children of Seth carried out of Chaldea by Abraham, who was \"the inheritor of the secrets of Enoch and the father of initiation in Israel.\"(28) According to this theory, which we find again propounded by the American Freemason, Dr. Mackey,(29) there was, besides the divine Cabala of the children of Seth, the magical Cabala of the children of Cain, which desc ended to the Sabeists. Or star-worshippers, of Chaldea, adepts in astrology and necromancy. Sorcery, as we know, had been practised by the Canaanites be fore the occupation of Palestine by the Israelites; Egypt, India, and Gr eece also had their soothsayers and diviners. In spite of the imprecations against sorcery containe d in the Law of Moses, the Jews, disregarding these warnings, caught the c ontagion and mingled the sacred tradition they had inherited with magical ideas partly borrowed from ot her races partly of their own devising. At the same time the specula tive side of the Jewish Cabala borrowed from the philosophy of the Persian Magi, of the Neo-Platonists, (30) and of the Neo- Pythagoreans. There is, then, some justifica tion for the anti-Cabalis ts' contention that what we know to-day as the Cabala is not of purely Jewish origin. 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Gougenot des Mousseaux, who had made a pr ofound study of occultism, asserts that there were therefore two Cabalas: the anci ent sacred tradition handed down from the first patriarchs of the human race; and the evil Cabala, wherein the sacred tradition was mingled by the Rabbis w ith barbaric superstitions, combined with their own imaginings and henceforth marked with their seal.(31) This view al so finds expression in the remarkable work of the conve rted Jew Drach, who refers to-- The ancient and true Cabala, which . . . we di stinguish from the modern Cabala, false, condemnable, and condemned by the Holy See, the work of the Rabbis, who have falsified and perverted the Talmudic traditi on. The doctors of the Synagogue trace if back to Moses, whilst at the same time adm itting that the principal truths it contains were those known by revelation to the first patriarchs of the world.(32) Further on Drach quotes the statement of Sixt us of Sienna, another converted Jew and a Dominican, protected by Pius V: Since by the decree of the Holy Roman I nquisition all books a ppertaining to the Cabala have lately been condemned, one must know that the Cabala is double ; that one is true, the other false. The true and pi ous one is that which . . . elucidates the secret mysteries of the holy law according to the principle of an alogy (i.e. figurative interpretation). This Cabala therefore the Church has never condemned. The false and impious Cabala is a certain mendacious kind of Jewish tradition, full of innumerable vanities and falsehoods, differing but little from necromancy. This kind of superstition therefore, improperly called Cabala, the C hurch within the last few years has deservedly condemned.(33) The modern Jewish Cabala presents a dual aspect-- theoretical and practical; the former concerned with theosophical speculati ons, the latter with ma gical practices. It would be impossible here to give an idea of Cabalistic th eosophy with its extraordinary imaginings on the Sephiroths, the attributes and f unctions of good and bad angels, dissertations on the nature of demons, and minute details on the appearance of God under the name of the An cient of Ancients, from whose head 400,000 worlds receive the light. \"The length of this face from the top of the head is three hundred and seventy times ten thousand wo rlds. It is called the ' Long Face,' for such is the name of the Ancient of Ancien ts.\"(34) The description of the hair and beard alone belonging to this gigantic countenance occupies a large place in the Zoharic treatise, Idra Raba.(35) According to the Cabala, every letter in the Scriptures contains a mystery only to be solved by the initiated.(36) By means of this system of interpretation passages of the Old Testament are shown to bear meanings to tally unapparent to the ordinary reader. Thus the Zohar explains that Noah was lame d for life by the bite of a lion whilst he was in the ark,(37) the advent ures of Jonah inside the wh ale are related with an extraordinary wealth of imagination,(38) whils t the beautiful story of Elisha and the Shunnamite woman is travestied in the most grotesque manner.(39) In the practical Cabala this method of \" decoding \" is reduced to a theurgic or magical system in which the healing of diseases plays an important part and is effected by means of the mystical arrangement of numb ers and letters, by the pronunciation of the Ineffable Name, by the use of amulets a nd talismans, or by compounds supposed to contain certain o ccult properties. 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"All these ideas derive from very ancient cult s; even the art of wo rking miracles by the use of the Divine Name, which after the a ppropriation of the Cabala by the Jews became the particular practice of Jewish mir acle-workers, appears to have originated in Chaldea.(40) Nor can the insistence on the Chosen People theory, which forms the basis of all Talmudic and Caba listic writings, be regarded as of purely Jewish origin; the ancient Egyptians likewise believed th emselves to be \"the peculiar people specially loved by the gods.\"(41) But in th e hands of the Jews this belief became a pretension to the exclusive enjoyment of di vine favour. According to the Zohar, \"all Israelites will have a part in the future world,\" (42) and on arrival there will not be handed over like the goyim (or non-Jewish race s) to the hands of the angel Douma and sent down to Hell.(43) Indeed the goyi m are even denied human attributes. The Zohar again explains that the words of the Scripture \"Jehovah Elohim made man \"mean that He made Israel.(44) The sevent eenth-century Rabbinical treatise Emek ha Melek observes: \" Our Rabbis of blessed me mory have said: ' Ye Jews are mea because of the soul ye have from the Supr eme Man (i.e. God). But the nations of the world are not styled men because they have not, from the Holy and Supreme Man, the Neschama (or glorious soul), but they have the Nephesch (soul) from Adam Belial, that is the malicious a nd unnecessary man, called Samm ael, the Supreme Devil.' \" (45) In conformity with this exclusive attitude towards the rest of the human race, the Messianic idea which forms the dominating th eme of the Cabala is made to serve purely Jewish interests. Yet in its origins this idea was possibly not Jewish. It is said by believers in an ancient secret tradition common to other races besides the Jews, that a part of this tradition related to a past Golden Age when man was free from care and evil non-existent, to the subsequent fall of Man and the loss of this primitive felicity, and finally to a reve lation received from Heaven fo retelling the reparation of this loss and the coming of a Redeemer w ho should save the world and restore the Golden Age. According to Drach: The tradition of a Man-God who should presen t Himself as the teacher and liberator of the fallen human race was constantly taught amongst all the enlightened nations of the globe. Vetus et constans opinio, as Suetoni us says. It is of all times and of all places.(46) And Drach goes on to quote the evidence of Volney, who had travelled in the East and declared that-- The sacred and mythologi cal traditions of earlier times had spread throughout all Asia the belief in a great Mediator who was to come, of a future Saviour, King, God, Conqueror, and Legisl ator who would bring back the Golden Age to earth and deliver men fr om the empire of evil.(47) All that can be said with any degree of certainty with regard to this belief is that it did exist amongst the Zoroastrians of Persia as well as amongst the Jews. D'Herbelot, quoting Abulfaraj, shows that five hundred ye ars before Christ, Zerdascht, the leader of the Zoroastrians, predicte d the coming of the Messiah, at whose birth a star would appear. He also told his disciples that the Me ssiah would be born of a virgin, that they would be the first to hear of Him, and that they should bri ng Him gifts.(48) Drach believes that this tradition was taught in the ancient synagogue,(49) thus explaining the words of St. Paul that unto the Jews \" were committed the oracles of God \" (50) : 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"This oral doctrine, which is the Cabala, had for its object the most sublime truths of the Faith which it brought back incessantly to the promised Redeemer, the foundation of the whole system of th e ancient tradition.(51) Drach further asserts that the doctrine of the Trinity formed a part of this tradition: Whoever has familiarized himself with that which was taught by the ancient doctors of the Synagogue, particularly those who lived before the coming of the Saviour, knows that the Trinity in one God was a truth admitted amongst them from the earliest times.(52) M. Vulliaud points out that Graetz admits the existence of this idea in the Zohar: \"It even taught certain doctrines which appeared favourable to the Christian dogma of the Trinity!\" And again: \"It is incontestable that the Zohar makes allusions to the beliefs in the Trinity and the Incarna tion.\" (53) M. Vulliaud adds : \" The idea of the Trinity must therefore play an important part in the Cabala, since it has been possible to affirm that ' the characteristic of the Z ohar and its particular conception is its attachment to the principle of the Trinity,' \" (54) and further quotes Edersheim as saying that \" a great part of the explanation given in the writings of the Cabalists resembles in a surprising manner the highest truths of Christianity.\" (55) It would appear, then, that certain remnants of the ancient secret tradition lingered on in the Cabala. The Jewish Encyclopodia, perhaps unintentionally, endorses this opinion, since in deriding the sixteenth-century Chri stian Cabalists for asserting that the Cabala contained traces of Christianity, it go es on to say that what appears to be Christian in the Cabala is onl y ancient esoteric doctrine.(56 ) Here, then, we have it on the authority of modern Jewish scholars th at the ancient secret tradition was in harmony with Christian teaching. But in th e teaching of the later synagogue the philosophy of the earlier sages was narrowed do wn to suit the exclusive system of the Jewish hierarchy and the ancient hope of a Redeemer who should restore Man to the state of felicity he had lost at the Fall was transformed into the idea of salvation for the Jews alone (57) under the ægis of a triumphant and even an avenging Messiah.(58) It is this Messianic dream perpetuated in the modern Cabala which nineteen hundred years ago the advent of Christ on earth came to disturb. THE COMING OF THE REDEEMER The fact that many Christian doctrines, such as the conception of a Trinity, the miraculous birth and murder of a Deity, had found a place in earlier religions has frequently been used as an argument to show that the story of Christ was merely a new version of various ancient legends, those of Attis, Adonis, or of Osiris, and that consequently the Christian re ligion is founded on a myth. The answer to this is that the existence of Christ on earth is an hist orical fact which no serious authority has ever denied. The attempts of such writers as Drews and J. M. Robertson to establish the theory of the \" Christ-Myth\" which find an echo in the utterances of Socialist orators,(59) have been met with so much able criticism as to need no further refutation. Sir John Frazer, who will certainly not be accused of bigoted orthodoxy, observes in this connexion: 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The doubts which have been cast on the hist orical reality of Je sus are, in my judgement, unworthy of serious attention. . . . To dissolve the founde r of Christianity into a myth, as some would do is hardly le ss absurd than it would be to do the same for Mohammed, Luther, and Calvin.(60) May not the fact that certain circumstances in the life of Christ were foreshadowed by earlier religions indica te, as Eliphas Lévi observes, that the ancients had an intuition of Christian mysteries? (61) To those therefore who had adhered to the ancient tradition, Christ appeared as the fulfilment of a prophecy as old as the Worl d. Thus the Wise Men came from afar to worship the babe of Bethlehem, and when they saw His star in the East they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. In Christ they hailed not only Him who was born King of the Jews, but the Saviour of the whole human race.(62) In the light of this great hope, that wondrous night in Bethlehem is seen in all its sublimity. Throughout the ages the seers had looked for the coming of the Redeemer, and lo! He was here; but it was not to the mi ghty in Israel, to the High Priests and the Scribes, that His birth was announced, but to humble shepherds watching their flocks by night. And these men of simple faith, heari ng from the angels \"the good tidings of great joy \"that a Saviour, \"Chr ist the Lord,\" was born went w ith haste to see the babe lying in the manger, and returned \"glorifyi ng and praising God.\" So also to the devout in Israel, to Simeon and to Anna the prophe tess, the great event appeared in its universal significance, and Simeon, departing in peace, knew that his eyes had seen the salvation that was to be \" a light to light en the Gentiles \" as well as the glory of the people of Israel. But to the Jews, in whose hands the ancient tr adition had been turned to the exclusive advantage of the Jewish race, the Rabbis, who had, moreover, constituted themselves the sole guardians within this nation of the said tradition, the manner of its fulfilment was necessarily abhorrent. Instead a resplend ent Messiah who should be presented by them to the people, a Saviour was born amongst the people themselves and brought to Jerusalem to be presented to the Lord ; a Saviour moreover who, as time went on, imparted His divine message to the poor and humble and declared that His Kingdom was not of this world. This was clearly what Mary meant when she said that God had \"scattered the proud in th e imagination of their hearts,\" that He had\" put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.\" Christ was therefore doubly hateful to the Jewish hierarchy in that He attacked the privilege of the race to which they belonged by throwing open the door to a ll mankind, and the privil ege of the caste to which they belonged by revealing sacred doctrines to the profane and destroying their claim to exclusive knowledge. Unless viewed from this aspect, neither th e antagonism displayed by the Scribes and Pharisees towards our Lord nor the denuncia tions He uttered against them can be properly understood. \"Woe unto you, Lawyers! For ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and th em that were entering in you hindered. . . . Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypoc rites! For ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in your selves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.\" What did Christ mean by the key of knowledge? Clearly the sacred tradition which, as Drach explains foreshadowed the doctrines of Christianity.(63) It 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"was the Rabbis who perverted that tradition, and thus \"the guilt of these perfidious Doctors consisted in their concealing from the people the traditional explanation of the sacred books by means of which they w ould have been able to recognize the Messiah in the person of Jesus Christ.\" (64) Many of the people, however, did recognize Him; indeed, the multitude acclaimed Him, spreading their garments before Him and crying, \"Hosanna to the Son of Davi d! Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord! \" Writers who have cite d the choice of Barabbas in the place of Christ as an instance of misguided popular judgement, overlook the fact that this choice was not spontaneous ; it was the Chie f Priests who delivered Christ \"from envy\" and who \" moved the people that Pi late should rather release unto them Barabbas.\" Then the people obediently cried out, \"Crucify Him!\" So also it was the Rabbis who, after hiding fr om the people the meaning of the sacred tradition at the moment of its fulfilment, af terwards poisoned that same stream for future generations. Abominable calumnies on Christ and Christian ity occur not only in the Cabala but in the ear lier editions of the Talmud. In these, says Barclay-- Our Lord and Saviour is \"that one,\" \" such a one ,\" \" a fool,\" \"the le per,\" \" the deceiver of Israel,\" etc. Efforts are made to prove th at He is the son of Joseph Pandira before his marriage with Mary. His miracles are attri buted to sorcery, the secret of which He brought in a slit in His flesh out of Egypt. He is said to have been first stoned and then hanged on the eve of the Passover. His discip les are called hereti cs and opprobrious names. They are accused of immoral pract ices, and the New Testament is called a sinful book. The references to these subjects manifest the most bitter aversion and hatred.(65). One might look in vain for passages such as th ese in English or French translations of the Talmud, for the reason that no complete tran slation exists in these languages. This fact is of great significance. Whilst the sacr ed books of every othe r important religion have been rendered into our own tongue a nd are open to everyone to study, the book that forms the foundation of modern Judaism is closed to the general public. We can read English translations of the Koran, of the Dhammapada, of the Sutta Nipata, of the Zend Avesta, of the Shu King, of the Laws of Manu, of the Bhagavadgita, but we cannot read the Talmud. In the long series of Sacred Books of the East the Talmud finds no place. All that is accessible to the ordinary reader consists, on one hand, in expurgated versions or judicious selections by Jewish and pro-Jewish compilers, and, on the other hand, in \"anti-semitic \" publica tions on which it would be dangerous to place reliance. The principal English transla tion by Rodkinson is very incomplete, and the folios are nowhere indicated, so that it is impossible to look up a passage.(66) The French translation by Jean de Pavly professes to present the entire text of the Venetian Talmud of 1520, but it does nothing of the kind.( 67) The translator, in the Preface, in fact admits that he has left out \"sterile discussions \"and has throughout attempted to tone down \" the brutality of cer tain expressions which offend our ears.\" This of course affords him infinite latitude, so that all pa ssages likely to prove displeasing to the \" Hébraïsants,\" to whom his work is partic ularly dedicated, are discreetly expunged. Jean de Pauly's translation of the Cabala a ppears, however, to be complete.(68) But a fair and honest renderin g of the whole Talmud into English or French still remains to be made. Moreover, even the Hebrew scholar is obliged to exercise some discrimination if he desires to consult the Talmud in its original form. For by the sixteenth century, when 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"the study of Hebrew became general amongst Christians, the anti -social and anti- Christian tendencies of the Talmud attracted the attention of the Censor, and in the Bâle Talmud of 1581 the most obnoxious passages and the entire treatise Abodah Zara were suppressed.(69) In the Cracow edition of 1604 that followe d, these passages were restored by the Jews, a proceeding which aroused so much indignation amongst Chri stian students of Hebrew that the Jews became alarmed. A ccordingly a Jewish synod, assembled in Poland in 1631, ordered the offending passages be expunged again, but--according to Drach--to be replaced by circ les which the Rabbis were to fi ll in orally when giving instruction to young Jews.(70) After that da te the Talmud was for a time carefully bowdlerized, so that in order to discover its original form it is advisable to go back to the Venetian Talmud of 1520 before any omissions were made, or to consult a modern edition. For now that the Jews no l onger fear the Christians, these passages are all said to have been replaced and no a ttempt is made, as in the Middle Ages, to prove that they do not refer to th e Founder of Christianity.(71) Thus the Jewish Encyclopodia admits that Jewish legends concerning Jesus are found in the Talmud and Midrash and \"the life of Jesus (Toledot Yeshu) that originated in the Middle Ages. It is the tendency of all th ese sources to belittle the person of Jesus by ascribing to Him illegitimate birth, magic, and a shameful death.\"(72) The last work mentioned, the Toledot Yes hu, or the Sepher Toldos Jeschu, described here as originating in the Middle Ages, proba bly belongs in realit y to a much earlier period. Eliphas Lévi asserts th at \" the Sepher Toldos, to which the Jews attribute a great antiquity and which they hid from the Ch ristians with such precautions that this book was for a long while unfindable, is quoted for the first time by Raymond Martin of the Order of the Preaching Brothers toward s the end of the thirteenth century. . . . This book was evidently written by a Rabbi initiated into the mysteries of the Cabala.\"(73) Whether then the Toledot Yeshu had existed for many centuries before it was first brought to light or whether it was a collection of Jewish traditions woven into a coherent narrative by a thirteenth-cen tury Rabbi, the ideas it contains can be traced back at least as far as the second cen tury of the Christian era. Origen, who in the middle of the third century wrote his reply to the attack of Cels us on Christianity, refers to a scandalous stor y closely resembling the Toledot Yeshu, which Celsus, who lived towards the end of the second century, had quoted on the authority of a Jew.(74) It is evident, therefore, th at the legend it contains had long been current in Jewish circles, but the book itself did not come into the hands of Christians until it was translated into Latin by Raymond Martin. La ter on Luther summari zed it in German under the name of Schem Hamphorasch; Wa genseil in 1681 and Huldrich in 1705 published Latin translations.(75) It is also to, be found in French in Gustave Brunet's Evangiles Apocryphes. However repugnant it is to transcribe any portion of this blasphemous work, its main outline must be given here in order to trace the subsequent course of the anti-Christian secret tradition in which, as we shall see, it has been perpetuated up to our own day. Briefly, then, the Toledot Yeshu relates with the most indecent details that Miriam, a hairdresser of Bethlehem,(76) affian ced to a young man named Jochanan, was seduced by a libertine, Joseph Panther or Pandira, a nd gave birth to a son whom she named Jehosuah or Jeschu. According to the Ta lmudic authors of the Sota and the 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Sanhedrim, Jeschu was taken during his boyhood to Egypt, where he was initiated into the secret doctrines of the priests, a nd on his return to Pale stine gave himself up to the practice of magic.(77) The Toledot Yeshu, however, goes on to say that on reaching manhood Jeschu learnt the secret of illegitimacy, on account of which he was driven out of the Synagogue and took ref uge for a time in Galilee. Now, there vas in the Temple a stone on which was e ngraved the Tetragrammaton or Schem Hamphorasch, that is to say, the Ineffable Na me of God; this stone had been found by King David when the foundations of the Te mple were being prepared and was deposited by him in the Holy of Holies. Jeschu, knowing this, came from Galilee and, penetrating into the Holy of Holies, read the Ineffable Name, which he transcribed on to a piece of parchment and concealed in an incision under his skin. By this means he was able to work miracles and to persuade the people that he was the son of God foretold by Isaiah. With the aid of Judas, the Sages of the Synagogue succeeded in capturing Jeschu, who was then led before the Great and Little Sanhedrim, by which he was condemned to be stoned to death and finally hanged. Such is the story of Christ according to the Jewish Cabalists, which should be compared not only with the Ch ristian tradition but with that of the Moslems. It is perhaps not sufficiently known that the Koran, whilst denying the divinity of Christ and also the fact of His crucifixion,(78) neverthele ss indignantly denounces the infamous legends concerning Him perpetuated by the Jews, and confirms in beautiful language the story of the Annunciation a nd the doctrine of the Miraculous Conception.(79) \" Remember when the angels said, ' O Mary! Verily hath God chosen thee and purified thee, and chosen thee above the women of the worlds.'. . . Remember when the angels said: ' O Mary! Verily God announceth to thee the Word from Him: His name shall be Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, illustrious in this world, and in the next, and one of those who have near access to God.' \" The Mother of Jesus is shown to have b een pure and to have \"kept her maidenhood\" (80) ; it was the Jews who spoke against Mary \"a grievous ca lumny.\" (81) Jesus Himself is described as \" strengthened w ith the Holy Spirit,\" and the Jews are reproached for rejecting \"the Apostle of God, \" (82) to whom was given \" the Evangel with its guidance and light conf irmatory of the preceding Law.\"(83) Thus during the centuries that saw the birth of Christiani ty, although other non- Christian forces arrayed themselves against the new faith, it was left to the Jews to inaugurate a campaign of vilification agai nst the person of its Founder, whom Moslems this day revere as one of the great teachers of the world.(84) THE ESSENES A subtler device for discrediting Christiani ty and undermining belief in the divine character of our Lord has been adopted by modern writers, principally Jewish, who set out to prove that He bel onged to the sect of the Essene s, a community of ascetics holding all goods in common, which had existe d in Palestine before the birth of Christ. Thus the Jewish hist orian Graetz declares that Je sus simply appropriated to himself the essential features of Essenism, and that primitive Christianity was \"nothing but an offshoot of Essenism.\"(85) The Christian Jew Dr. Ginsburg partially endorses this view in a small pamphlet (86) containing most of the evidence that has been brought forward on the subject, and himsel f expresses the opinion that \" it will hardly be doubted that our Saviour Himsel f belonged to this holy brotherhood.\" (87) 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"So after representing Christ as a magician in the Toledot Yeshu and the Talmud, Jewish tradition seeks to explain His miracul ous works as those of a mere healer--an idea that we shall find descending right thr ough the secret societies to this day. Of course if this were true, if the miracles of Christ were simply due to knowledge of natural law and His doctrines were the outco me of a sect, the whole theory of His divine power and mission falls to the ground. Th is is why it is esse ntial to expose the fallacies and even the bad faith on which the attempt to identify Him with the Essenes is based. Now, we have only to study the Gospels carefull y in order to realize that the teachings of Christ were totally different from those peculiar to the Essenes.(88) Christ did not live in a fraternity, but, as Dr. Ginsburg hi mself points out, associ ated with publicans and sinners. The Essenes did not frequent the Temple and Christ was there frequently. The Essenes disapproved of wine and marriage, whilst Christ sanctioned marriage by His presence at the wedding of Cana in Gali lee and there turned water into wine. A further point, the most conclusive of all, Dr . Ginsburg ignores, namely, that one of the principal traits of the Essene s which distinguished them from the other Jewish sects of their day was their disapproval of ointment , which they regarded as defiling, whilst Christ not only commended the woman who brought the precious jar of ointment, but reproached Simon for the omission: \" My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed My feet w ith ointment.\" It is obvious th at if Christ had been an Essene but had departed from His usual cust om on this occasion out of deference to the woman's feelings, He would have unders tood why Simon had not offered Him the same attention, and at any rate Simon w ould have excused himself on these grounds. Further if His disciples had been Essenes, w ould they not have protested against this violation of their principles, instead of merely objecting that the ointment was of too costly a kind? But it is in attributing to Christ the Comm unistic doctrines of the Essenes that Dr. Ginsburg's conclusions are the most misleading- -a point of particular importance in view of the fact that it is on this false hypothesis that so-c alled \"Christian Socialism\" has been built up. \"The Essenes,\" he writes, had all things in common, and appointed one of the brethren as steward to manage the common bag; so the primitive Christians (Acts ii. 44, 45, iv. 32-4; John xii. 6, xiii. 29).\" It is perfectly true that, as the first reference to the Acts testifies, some of th e primitive Christians after the death of Christ formed themselves into a body having all things in common, but there is not the slightest evidence that Christ and His disciples followed this principle. The solitary passage in the Gospel of St. John, wh ich are all that Dr. Ginsburg can quote in support of this contention, may have referred to an alms-bag or a fund for certain expenses, not to a common pool of all m onetary wealth. Still less is there any evidence that Christ advocated Communism to the world in general. When the young man having great possessions asked what he sh ould do to inherit eternal life, Christ told him to follow the commandments, but on the young man asking what more he could do, answered: \"If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor.\" Renunciation but not the pooling of al wealth was thus a counsel of perfection for the few who desired to devote their lives to God, as monks a nd nuns have always done, and bore no relation to the Communistic system of the Essenes. Dr. Ginsburg goes on to say : \" Essen's put all its members on the same level, forbidding the exercise of aut hority of one over the other an d enjoining mutual service ; so Christ (Matt. xx. 25-8; Mark ix. 35-7, x. 42-5). Essenism commanded its disciples 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"to call no man master upon the earth, so Christ (Matt. xxiii. 8-10) .\" As a matter of fact, Christ strongly upheld the exercise of authority, not only in the oft-quoted passage, \"Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's,\" but His approval of the Centurion's speech. \"I am a man under auth ority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and the, Come , and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.\" Ever ywhere Christ commends the faithful servant and enjoins obedience to masters. If we look up the refere nce to the Gospel of St. Matthew where Dr. Ginsburg says that Christ commanded His disciples to call no man master on earth, we shall find that he has not only perverted the sense of the passage but reversed the order of the words, whic h, following a denunciation of the Jewish Rabbis, runs thus: \" But not ye called Rabbi: for one is your master, even Christ, and all ye are brethren. . . . Neither be ye called masters: one is your master, even Christ. But he that is greatest among you shall be your serv ant.\" The apostles were, therefore, never ordered to call no man master, but not to be called master themselves. Moreover, if we refer to the Greek text we sh all see that this was meant in a spiritual and not a social sense. The word for \" mast er \" here given is in the first verse i.e. teacher, in the second, literally guide, and the word for servant is . When masters and servants in the social sense are referred to in the Gospels, the word employed for master is and for servant . Dr. Ginsburg should have been aware of this distinction a nd that the passage in questi on had therefore no bearing on his argument. As a matter of fact it would appear that some of the apostles kept servants, since Christ commends them fo r exacting strict a ttention to duty: Which of you, having a servant ploughing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat ? And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken ; and afterwards thou sha lt eat and drink ? Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded to him? I trow not.(89) This passage would alone suffice to show that Christ and His apostl es did not inhabit communities where all were equal, but follo wed the usual practices of the social system under which they lived, though adopting certain rules, such as taking only one garment and carrying no money when they went on journeys. Those resemblances between the teaching of the Essenes a nd the Sermon on the Mount which Dr. Ginsburg indicates refer not to the customs of a sect, but to general precepts for human conduct--humility meekne ss, charity, and so forth. At the same time it is clear that if the Essenes in general conformed to some of the principles laid down by Christ, certain of thei r doctrines were completely at variance with those of Christ and of primitive Christia ns, in particular their custom of praying to the rising sun and their di sbelief in the resu rrection of the body.(90) St. Paul denounces asceticism, warning the brethren that \"in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstai n from meats which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving . . . If thou 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ.\" This would suggest that certain Essenean ideas had crept into Christian communities and were regarded by those who remembered Christ's true teaching as a dangerous perversion. The Essenes were therefore not Christians , but a secret society, practising four degrees of initiation, and bound by a terrible oaths not to divulge the sacred mysteries confided to them. And what were those my steries but those of the Jewish secret tradition which we now know as the Cabala ? Dr. Ginsburg th rows an important light on Essenism when, in one passage alone, he re fers to the obligation of the Essenes \" not to divulge the secret doc trines to anyone, . . . carefu lly to preserve the books belonging to their sect and na mes of the angels or the my steries connected with the Tetragrammaton and the other names of God and angels, comprised in the theosophy as well as with the cosmology which also played so important a part among the Jewish mystics and the Kabbalists.\" (91) The truth is clearly that the Essenes were Cabalists, though doubtless Cabalists of a supe rior kind. The Cabala they possessed very possibly descended from pre-Christian times and had remained uncontaminated by the anti-Christian strain introduced in to it by the Rabbis af ter the death of Christ.(92) The Essenes are of importance to the subjec t of this book as the first of the secret societies from which a direct line of traditi on can be traced up to the present day. But if in this peaceful community no actually an ti-Christian influence is to be discerned, the same cannot be said of the succeedi ng pseudo-Christian sects which, whilst professing Christianity, mingled with Christian doctrines the poison of the perverted Cabala, main source of the errors which he nceforth rent the Christian Church in twain. THE GNOSTICS The first school of thought to create a schism in Christianity was the collection of sects known under the generic name of Gnos ticism. In its purer forms Gnosticism aimed at supplementing faith by knowledge of eternal verities and at giving a wider meaning to Christianity by linking it up with earlier faiths. \"The belief that the divinity had been manifested in the religious institutions of all nations \"(93) thus led to the conception of a sort of universal religion containing th e divine elements of all. Gnosticism, however, as the Jewish Ency clopædia points out, \"was Jewish in character long before it became Christian. \"(94) M. Matter indicates Syria and Palestine as its cradle and Alexandria as the centre by which it was influenced at the time of its alliance with Christianity. This influence again was predominantly Jewish. Philo and Aristobulus, the leading Jewish philosophers of Alexandria, \" wholly attached to the ancient religion of their fathers, both resolved to adorn it with the spoils of other systems and to open to Juda ism the way to immense conquests.\" (95) 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"This method of borrowing from other races a nd religions those ideas useful for their purpose has always been the custom of the Jews. The Cabala, as we have seen, was made up of these heterogeneous elements . And it is here we find the principal progenitor of Gnosticism. The Freemason Ra gon gives the clue in the words: The Cabala is the key of the occult sciences. Th e Gnostics were born of the Cabalists.\"(96) For the Cabala was much older than the G nostics. Modern historians who date it merely from the publication of the Zohar by Moses de Leon in the thirteenth century or from the school of Luria in the sixteenth century obscure this most important fact which Jewish savants have always clearly recognized.(97) The Je wish Encyclopædia, whilst denying the certainty of connexion between Gnosticism and the Cabala, nevertheless admits that the investigations of the anti-Cabalist Graetz \" must be resumed on a new basis,\" and it goes on to show that \" it was Alexandria of the first century, or earlier, with her strange comm ingling of Egyptian, Chaldean, Judean, and Greek culture which furnished soil and seed s for that mystic philosophy,\" (98) But since Alexandria was at the same period th e home of Gnosticism, which was formed from the same elements enumerated here, the connexion between the two systems is clearly evident. M. Matter is therefore right in saying that Gnosticism was not a defection from Christianity but a combination of systems into which a few Christian elements were introduced. The result of Gnos ticism was thus not to Christianize the Cabala, but to cabalize Christianity by mi ngling its pure and simple teaching with theosophy and even magic. The Jewish Ency clopædia quotes the opinion that \" the central doctrine of Gnosticism--a movement closely connected with Jewish mysticism--was nothing else than the attempt to liberate the soul a nd unite it with God \"; but as this was apparently to be eff ected \" through the employm ent of mysteries, incantations, names of angels,\" etc., it will be seen how widely even this phase of Gnosticism differ from Christianity and identifi es itself with the magical Cabala of the Jews. Indeed, the man generally recognized as the founder of Gnosticism, a Jew commonly known as Simon Magus, was not only a Cabalis t mystic but avowedly a magician, who with a band of Jews, including his mast er Dositheus and his disciples Menander and Cerinthus, instituted a priesthood of th e Mysteries and practised occult arts and exorcisms.(99) It was this Simon of whom we read in the Acts of the Apostles that he \"bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God,\" and who sought to purchase the power of the laying on of hands with money. Simon, indeed, crazed by his incan tations and ecstasies, developed megalomania in an acute form, arrogating to himself divine honour s and aspiring to the adoration of the whole world. According to a contemporary legend, he eventually became sorcerer to Nero and ended his life in Rome.(100) The prevalence of sorcery amongst the Jews dur ing the first century of the Christian era is shown by other passages in the Acts of the Apostles ; in Paphos the \" false prophet,\" a Jew, whose surname was Bar-Jesus, otherwise known as \" Elymas the sorcerer,\" opposed the teaching of St. Paul and brought on himself the imprecation : \" O full of all subtlety and all mischief, t hou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to perv ert the right ways of the Lord ? \" Perversion is the keynote of all the deba sed forms of Gnosticism. According to Eliphas Lévi, certain of the Gnostics introduced into their rites that profanation of 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Christian mysteries which was to form th e basis of black magic in the Middle Ages.(101) The glorification of evil, which plays so important a part in the modern revolutionary movement, constituted the cr eed of the Ophites, who worshipped the Serpent because he had revolted against Jehovah, to whom they referred under the Cabalistic term of the \" demiurgus,\" (102) and still more of the Cainites, so-called from their cult of Cain, whom, with Dathan and Abiram, the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, and finally Judas Iscariot, th ey regarded as noble victims of the demiurgus.(103) Animated by hatred of a ll social and moral order, the Cainites \"called upon all men to destroy the work s of God and to commit every kind of infamy.\"(104) These men were therefore not only the en emies of Christianity but of orthodox Judaism, since it was against th e Jehovah of the Jews that th eir hatred was particularly directed. Another Gnostic s ect the Carpocratians, followe rs of Carpocrates of Alexandria and his son Epiphamus--who di ed from his debaucheries and was venerated as a god(105)--likewise regarded all written laws, Christian or Mosaic, with contempt and recognised only the or knowledge given to the great men of every nation--Plato and Pythagoras, Moses and Chri st--which \" frees one from all that the vulgar call religion\" and \" makes man equal to God.\"(106) So in the Carpocratians of the second centu ry we find already th e tendency towards that deification of humanity which forms the supreme doctrine of the secret societies and of the visionary Socialists of our day. The war now begins between the two contending principles : the Christian con ception of man reaching up to God and the secret society conception of man as G od, needing no revelation from on high and no guidance but the law of his own nature. And since that nature is in itself divine, all that springs from it is praiseworthy, and those acts usually regarded as sins are not to be condemned. By this line of reasoning the Carpocratians arrived at much the same conclusions as modern Communists with rega rd to the ideal social system. Thus Epiphanus held that since Nature herself re veals the principle of the community and the unity of all things, human laws which are contrary to this law of Nature are so many culpable infractions of the legitimate order of things. Before these laws were imposed on humanity everything was in common--land, goods, and women. According to certain contemporaries, the Ca rpocratians returned to this primitive system by instituting the community of women and indulging in every kind of licence. The further Gnostic sect of Antitacts, following this same cult of human nature, taught revolt against all positive religion and laws a nd the necessity for gratifying the flesh ; the Adamites of North Africa, going a step furt her in the return to Nature, cast off all clothing at their religious service so as to represent the primitive innocence of the garden of Eden--a precedent followed by the Adamites of Germany in the fifteenth century.(107) These Gnostics, says Eliphas Lévi, under the pretext of \"spiritualizing matter, materialized the spirit in the most revolting wa ys. . . . Rebels to the hierarchic order, . . . they wished to substitute the mystical licence of sensual passions to wise Christian sobriety and obedience to laws. . . . Enemies of the family, they wished to produce sterility by increasing debauchery.\"(108) 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"By way of systematically perverting the doctrines of the Christian faith the Gnostics claimed to possess the true versions of the Go spels, and professed belief in these to the exclusion of all the others.(109) Thus the Ebionites had their own corrupted version of the Gospel of St. Matthew founded on the \" Gospel of the Hebrews,\" known earlier to the Jewish Christians ; the Marcosians had their version of St. Luke, the Cainites their own \" Gospel of Judas,\" and the Valentinians th eir \" Gospel of St. John.\" As we shall see later, the Gospel of St. John is the one that throughout the war on Christianity has been specially ch osen for the purpose of perversion. Of course this spirit of perversion was nothing new; many centuries earlier the prophet Isaiah had denounced it in the word s: \"Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil ; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness ! \" But the rôle of the Gnostics was to reduce perversion to a syst em by binding men together into sects working under the guise of enli ghtenment in order to obscure all recognized ideas of morality and religion. It is this which consti tutes their importance in the history of secret societies. Whether the Gnostics themselves can be descri bed as a secret society, or rather as a ramification of secret societies, is open to question. M. Matter, quoting a number of third century writers, shows the possibility th at they had mysteries and initiations; the Church Fathers definitely asserted this to be the case. (110) According to Tertullian, the Valentinians continued, or rather perverted, the mysteries of Eleusis, out of which they made a \"sanctuary of prostitution.\"(111) The Valentinians are known to have divide d their members into three classes--the Pneumatics, the Psychics, and the Hylics (i.e. materialists); the Basilideans are also said to have possessed secret doctrines known to hardly one in a thousand of the sect. From all this M. Matter concludes that: 1. The Gnostics professed to hold by means of tradition a secret doctr ine superior to that contained in the public writings of the apostles. 2. That they did not communicate th is doctrine to everyone. . . . 3. That they communicated it by means of emblems and symbols, as the Diagram of the Ophites proves. 4. That in these communications they imitated the rites and trials of the mysteries of Eleusis.(112) This claim to the possession of a secret oral tradition, whether known under the name of or of Cabala, confirms the conception of the Gnostics as Cabalists and shows how far they had departed from Christian t eaching. For if only in this idea of \"one doctrine for the ignorant and another for a initiated,\" the Gnostics had restored the very system which Christianity had come to destroy.(113). MANICHEISM Whilst we have seen the Gnostic sects work ing for more or less subversive purposes under the guise of esoteric doctrines, we find in the Manicheans of Persia, who followed a century later, a s ect embodying the same tendencies and approaching still nearer to secret so ciety organization. 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Cubricus or Corbicius, the founder of Ma nicheism, was born in Babylonia about the year A.D. 216. Whilst still a child he is said to have been bought as a slave by a rich widow of Ctesiphon, who liberated him and on her death left him great wealth. According to another story --for the whole history of Manes rests on legends--he inherited from a rich old woman the books of a Saracen named Scythianus on the wisdom of the Egyptians. Combining the doctr ines these books contained with ideas borrowed from Zoroastrianism, Gnosticism, and Christianity, and also with certain additions of his own, he elaborated a philos ophic system which he proceeded to teach. Cubricus then changed his name to Mani or Manes and proclaimed himself the Paraclete promised by Jesus Christ. His followe rs were divided into two classes--the outer circle of hearers or combatants, and the inner circle of teachers or ascetics described as the Elect. As evidence of th eir resemblance with Freemasons, it has been said that the Manicheans made use of secret signs, grips, and passwords, that owing to the circumstances of their master's adoption they called Manes \" the son of the widow \" and themselves \" the children of the widow,\" but this is not clea rly proved. One of their customs is, however, interesting in th is connexion. Accordi ng to legend, Manes undertook to cure the son of the King of Pers ia who had fallen ill, but the prince died, whereupon Manes was flayed alive by order of the king and his corpse hanged up at the city gate. Every year af ter this, on Good Friday, the Manicheans carried out a mourning ceremony known as the Bema around th e catafalque of Manes, whose real sufferings they were wont to contrast with the unreal suffe rings of Christ. The fundamental doctrine of Manicheism is Du alism-- that is to say, the existence of two opposing principles in the world, li ght and darkness, good and evil--founded, however, not on the Christian conception of this idea, but on the Zoroastrian conception of Ormuzd and Harriman, and so perverted and mingled with Cabalistic superstitions that it met with as veheme nt denunciation by Persian priests as by Christian Fathers. Thus, according to the doctrine of Manes, all matter is absolute, the principle of evil is eternal, humanity itself of satanic origin, and the first human beings, Adam and Eve, are represented as the offspring of devils.(114) Much the same idea may be found in the Jewish Cabala, wh ere it is said that Adam, after other abominable practices, cohabite d with female devils whilst Eve consoled herself with male devils, so that whole races of demons were born into the world. Eve is also accused of cohabiting with the Serpent.(115) In the Yalkut Shimoni it is also related that during the 130 years that Adam lived ap art from Eve, \" he begat a generation of devils, spirits, and hobgoblins \"(116) Manich ean demonology thus paved the way for the placation of the powers of darkness practised by the Euchites at the end of the fourth century and later by the Paulicians , the Bogomils and the Luciferians. So it is in Gnosticism and Manicheism that we find evidence of the first attempts to pervert Christianity. The very fact that all such have been condemned by the Church as \"heresies\" has tended to enlist sympathy in their favour, yet even Eliphas Lévi recognizes that here the action of the Church was right, for the \" monstrous gnosis of Manes \" was a desecration not only of Christia n doctrines but of pre-Christian sacred traditions. 1.

In the middle of the seventh century an immense schism was created in Is lam by the rival advocates of successors to the Prophet, the orthodox Islamites known by the name of Sunnis adhering to the elected Khalifas Abu Bakr, Omar, and Othm an, whilst the party of revolt, known as the Shiahs, claimed the Khalifate for the descendants of Mohammed through Ali, son of Abu-Talib and husband of Fatima, the Prophet's daughter. This division ended in open warfare ; Ali was finally assassinate d, his elder son Hasan was poisoned in Medina, his younger son Husain fell at the ba ttle of Kerbela fighting against the supporters of Othman. The deaths of Hasan and Husain are still mourned yearly by the Shiahs at the Moharram. THE ISMAILIS The Shiahs themselves split again over the question of Ali's successors into four factions, the fourth of which divided again into two further sects. Both of these retained their allegiance to th e descendants of Ali as far as Jafar-as-Sadik but whilst one party, known as the Imamias or Isna-Asharias i.e. the Twelve rs), supported the succession through his younger son Musa to the twelfth Imam Mohammed, son of Askeri, the Ismailis (or Seveners) adhered to Ismail, the elder son of Jafar-as-Sadik. So far, however, in spite of divisions, no body of Shiahs had ever deviated from the fundamental doctrines of Islamism but merely claimed that these had been handed down through a different line from that recognized by the Sunnis. The earliest Ismailis, who formed themselves into a party at about the time of the death of Mohammed, son of Ismail (i.e.circ. A.D. 770) still remained believers, declaring only that the true teaching of the Prophet had de scended to Mohammed, who was not dead but would return in the fullness of time a nd that he was the Mahdi whom Moslems must await. But in about A.D. 87, an intri guer of extraordinary s ubtlety succeeded in capturing the movement, which, hitherto mere ly schismatic, now became definitely subversive, not only of Islamism, but of all religious belief. This man, Abdullah ibn Maymn, the son of a learned and free-thi nking doctor in Southern Persia, brought up in the doctri nes of Gnostic Dualism and profoundly versed in all religions, was in reality, like hi s father, a pure material ist. By professing adherence to the creed of orthodox Shi-ism, and proclaiming a knowledge of the mystic doctrines which the Ismailis believed to have descended through Ismail to his son Mohammed, Abdullah succeeded in placing himself at the head of the Ismailis. His advocacy of Ismail was thus merely a mas k, his real aim being materialism, which he now proceeded to make into a system by founding a sect known as the Batinis with seven degrees of initiation. Dozy has given the following description of this amazing 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"project : To link together into one body th e vanquished and the conquerors ; to unite in the form of a vast secret society with many degrees of initia tion free-thinkers--who regarded religion only as curb for the people--and bigots of all sects ; to make tools of believers in order to give power to sceptic s ; to induce conquerors to overturn the empires they had founded ; to build up a pa rty, numerous, compact, and disciplined, which in due time would give the throne, if not to himself, at least to his descendants, such was Abdullah ibn Maymn's general aim --an extraordinary conception which he worked out with marvellous tact, incomp arable skill, and profound knowledge of the human heart. The means which he adopted we re devised with dia bolical cunning. . . . It was . . . not among the Shi-ites that he sought his true supporters, but among the Ghebers, the Manicheans, the pagans of Ha rran, and the students of Greek philosophy ; on the last alone could he rely, to them alone could he gradually unfold the final mystery, and reveal that Imams, religions, and morality were nothing but an imposture and an absurdity. The rest of ma nkind--the \" asses,\" as Abdullah called them--were incapable of unders tanding such doctrines. But to gain his end he by no means disdained their aid ; on the contrary, he solicited it, but he took care to initiate devout and lowly souls only in the first grad es of the sect. His mi ssionaries, who were inculcated with the idea that their first duty was to conceal their true sentiments and adapt themselves to the views of their auditors, appeared in many guises, and spoke, as it were, in a different language to each class. They won over the ignorant vulgar by feats of legerdemain which passed for miracles or excited their curiosity by enigmatical discourse. In the presence of the devout they assumed the mask of virtue and piety. With mystics they were mysti cal, and unfolded the inner meanings of phenomena, or explained allegories and the figurative sense of the allegories themselves. . . . By means such as these the extraordinary result was brought about that a multitude of men of diverse beliefs were all working toge ther for an object known only to a few of them. . . .(2) I quote this passage at length because it is of immense importance in throwing a light on the organization of modern secret societies. It does not matter what the end may be, whether political, social, or religious, th e system remains the same--the setting in motion of a vast number of people and ma king them work in a cause unknown to them. That this was the method adopted by Weishaupt in organizing the Illuminati and that it came to him from the East will be shown later on. We shall now see how the system of the philosopher Abdullah pa ved the way for bloodshed by the most terrible sect the world had ever seen. THE KARMATHITES The first open acts of violence resulting from the doctrines of A bdullah were carried out by the Karmathites, a new development of the Ismailis. Amongst the many Dais sent out by the leader--which included his son Ahmed and Ahmed's son--was the Dai Hosein Ahwazi, Abdullah's envoy to Irak in Persia, who initiated a certain Hamdan surnamed Karmath into the secrets of the sect. Karmath, who was a born intriguer and believed in nothing, became the leader of the Karmathites in Arabia, where a number of Arabs were soon enlisted in the society. With extraordinary skill he succeeded in 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"persuading these dupes to make over all their money to him, first by means of small contributions, later by larger sums, until at last he convinced them of the advantages of abolishing all private pr operty and establishing the sy stem of the community of goods and wives. This principle was enfo rced by the passage of the Koran : \" Remember the grace of God in that whils t you were enemies, He has united your hearts, so that by His grace you have become br others. . . .\" De Sacy thus transcribes the methods employed as given by the historian Nowairi : When Karmath had succeeded in establishi ng all this, and everyone had agreed to conform to it, he ordered the Dais to assemb le all the women on a certain night so that they should mingle promiscuously with all th e men. This, he said, was perfection and the last degree of friendship and fraterna l union. Often a husband led his wife and presented her himself to one of his brothers when that gave him pleasure. When he (Karmath) saw that he had become absolute master of their minds, had assured himself of their obedience, and found out the degree of their intelligence and discernment, he began to lead them quite astray. He put before them arguments borrowed from the doctrines of the Dualists. They fell in easily with all that he proposed, and then he took away from them all religion and released them from all those duties of piety, devotion, a nd the fear of God that he pr escribed for them in the beginning. He permitted them pillage, and ever y sort of immoral licence, and taught them to throw off the yoke of prayer, fasting, and other precepts. He taught them that they were held by no obligations, and that they could pillage the goods and shed the blood of their adversaries with impunity, that the knowledge of the master of truth to whom he had called them took the place of everything else, and that with this knowledge they need no longer fear sin or punishment. As the result of these teachings the Karmat hites rapidly became a band of brigands, pillaging and massacring all those who oppos ed them and spreading terror throughout all the surrounding districts. Peaceful fraternity was thus turned into a wild lust for conquest ; the Karmathites succeeded in dominating a great part of Arabia and the mouth of the Euphrates, and in A.D. 920 extended their ravages westwards. They took possession of the holy city of Mecca, in the defence of which 30,000 Moslems fell. \" For a whole century,\" says von Hammer, \" the pernicious doctrines of Ka rmath raged with fire and sword in the very bosom of Islamism, until the widespr ead conflagration was extinguished in blood.\" But in proclaiming themselves revolutionaries the Karmath ites had departed from the plan laid down by the originator of th eir creed, Abdullah ibn Maymn, which had consisted not in acts of open violence but in a secret doctrine which should lead to the gradual undermining of all religious faith a nd a condition of mental anarchy rather than of material chaos. For violence, as al ways, had produced counter violence, and it was thus that while the Karmathites were rushing to their own destruction through a series of bloody conflicts, another branch of the Ismailis were quietly reorganizing their forces more in conformity with the or iginal method of their founder. These were the Fatimites, so-called from their professed belief that the doctrine of the Prophet had descended from Ali, husband of Fatima, M ohammed's daughter. Whilst less extreme than the Karmathites, or than their pr edecessor Abdullah ibn Maymn, the Fatimites, according to the historian Makrizi, adopted the method of instilling doubts into the minds of believers and aimed at the substitution of a natural for a revealed religion. 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Indeed, after the establ ishment of their power in Egypt, it is difficult to distinguish any appreciable degree of difference in th e character of their teaching from the anarchic code of Abdullah and his more violent exponent Karmath. THE FATIMITES The founder of the Fatimite dynasty of the Kh alifas was one Ubeidallah, known as the Mahdi, accused of Jewish ancestry by his a dversaries the Abbaside s, who declared -- apparently without truth--tha t he was the son or grandson of Ahmed, son of Abdullah ibn Maymn, by a Jewess. Under the fourth Fa timite Khalifa Egypt fell into the power of the dynasty and, before long, bi-weekly assemblages of both men and women known as \" societies of wisdom \" were inst ituted in Cairo. In 1004 these acquired a greater importance by the esta blishment of the Dar ul Hikmat, or the House of Knowledge, by the sixth Khalifa Hakim, who wa s raised to a deity after his death and is worshipped to this day by the Druses. Unde r the direction of the Dar ul Hikmat or Grand Lodge of Cairo, the Fatimites conti nued the plan of Abdullah ibn Maymn's secret society with the addition of two more degrees making nine in all. Their method of enlisting proselytes and stem of initia tion --which, as Claudi o Jannet points out, \" are absolutely those which Weis haupt, the founder of the Illuminati, prescribed to the ' Insinuating Brothers ' \" (3)--were transcribe d by the fourteenth-century historian Nowairi in a description that may be briefly summarized thus (4) : The proselytes were broadly divided into tw o classes, the learne d and the ignorant. The Dai was to agree with the former, applauding his wisdom, and to impress the latter with his own knowledge by asking him perplexing questions on the Koran. Thus in initiating him into the first degree th e Dai assumed an air of profundity and explained that religious doctrines were too abstruse for the ordinary mind, but must be interpreted by men w ho, like the Dais, had a special know ledge of this science. The initiate was bound to absolute secrecy concerning the truths to be revealed to him and obliged to pay in advance for these revelations . In order to pique his curiosity, the Dai would suddenly stop short in the middle of a discourse, and should the novice finally decline to pay the required sum, he was left in a state of bewilderment which inspired him with the desire to know more. In the second degree the initiate was persua ded that all his ormer teachers were wrong and that he must place his confidence solely in those Imams endowed with authority from God ; in the third he learnt that thes e Imams were those of the Ismailis, seven in number ending with Mohammed, son of Ismail, in contradistinction to the twelve Imams of the Imamias who supported the clai ms of Ismail's brother Musa ; in the fourth he was told that the prophets preceding the Imams descending from Ali were also seven in number--namely Adam, Noa h, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, the first Mohammed, and finally Mohammed son of Ismail. So far, then, nothing was said to the initiate in contradiction to the broad tenets of orthodox Islamism. But with the fifth degree the process of underm ining his religion began, he was now told to re ject tradition and to disregar d the precepts of Mohammed ; in the sixth he was taught that all religious observances--prayer, fasting, etc.--were only emblematic that in fact all these things were devices to keep the common herd of men in subordination ; in the seventh the doc trines of Dualism, of a greater and a 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"lesser deity, were introduced and the unity of God--fundamental doctrine of Islamism was destroyed ; in the eighth a great vaguene ss was expressed on the attributes of the first and greatest of these deities, and it wa s pointed out that real prophets were those who concerned themselves with practical matters--political institutions and good forms of government ; finally, in the nint h, the adept was shown that all religious teaching was allegorical and the religious prec epts need only be observed in so far as it is necessary to maintain order, but the man who understands the truth may disregard all such doctrines. Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and the other prophets were therefore only teachers who had profited by the lessons of philosophy. All belief in revealed religion was thus destroyed. It will be seen then that in the last degrees the whole teaching of the first five was reversed and therefore shown to be a fraud. Fraud in fact constituted the system of the society ; in the instructions to the Dais every artifice is described for enlisting proselytes by misrepresentation : Jews were to be won by speaking ill of Christians, Christians by speaking ill of Je ws and Moslems alike, Sunnis by referring with respect to the orthodox Khalifas Abu Ba kr and Omar and criticizing Ali and his descendants. Above all, care was to be taken not to put before pr oselytes doctrines that might revolt them, but to make them a dvance step by step. By these means they would be ready to obey any commands. As the instructions express it : If you were to give the order to whoever it mi ght be to take from him all that he holds most precious, above all his money, he would oppose none of your orders, and if death surprised him he would leave you all that he possesses in his will and make you his heir. He will think that in the whole wo rld he cannot find a man more worthy than you. Such was the great secret society which was to form the model for the Illuminati of the eighteenth century, to whom the summary of von Hammer might with equal truth apply: To believe nothing and to dare all wa s, in two words, the sum of this system, which annihilated every principle of re ligion and morality, an d had no other object than to execute ambitious designs with su itable ministers who, daring all and knowing nothing, since they consider everything a ch eat and nothing forbidden, are the best tools of an infernal policy. A system which, w ith no other aim than the gratification of an insatiable lust for domination, instead of seeking the highest of human objects, precipitates itself into the abyss, and mangling itself, is buried amidst the ruins of thrones and altars, the wreck of national happiness, and th e universal execration of mankind.(5) THE DRUSES The terrible Grand Lodge of Cairo befo re long became the centre of a new and extraordinary cult. Hakim sixth Fatimite Kh alifa and founder of the Dar ul Hikmat--a monster of tyranny and crime whose reign can on ly be compared to that of Caligula or Nero--was now raised to the place of a divinity by one Ismail Darazi, a Turk who in 1016 announced in a mosque in Cairo that the Khalifa should be made an object of worship. Hakim, who \" believed that divine reason was incarnate in him,\" four years later proclaimed itself a deity, and the cu lt was finally established by one of his 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"viziers, the Persian mystic Hamza ibn Ali. Hakim's cruelties, however, had so outraged the people of Egypt that a year later he was murdered by a band of malcontents, led, it is said, by his sist er, who afterwards concealed his body-- circumstance which gave his followers the oppo rtunity to declare that the divinity had merely vanished in order to test the faith of believers, but would reappear in time and punish apostates. This belief became the doctrine of the Druses of Lebanon, whom Darazi had won over to the worship of Hakim. It is unnecessary to enter into the details of this strange religion, which still persists to-day in the range of Lebanon ; suffice it to say that, although th e outcome of the Ismailis, the Druses do not appear to have embraced the materialism of Abdullah ibn Maymn, but to have grafted on a primitive form of Nature-worship and of Sabeism the avowed belief of the Ismailis in the dynasty of Ali and his successors, and beyond this an abstruse, esoteric creed concerning the nature of the Supreme Deity. God they declare to be \" Universal Reason,\" who mani fests Himself by a series of \" avatars.\" Hakim was the last of the divine embodime nts, and \" when evil and misery have increased to the predestined height he will again appear, to conquer the world and to make his religion supreme.\" It is, however, as a secret so ciety that the Druses enter into the scope of this book, for their organization presents several analogies with that which we now know as \" masonic.\" Instead of the nine degrees institut ed by the Lodge of Cairo, the Druses are divided into only three--Profa nes, Aspirants, and Wise--to whom their doctrines are gradually unfolded under seal of the strictest secrecy, to ensure which signs and pass words are employed after the manner of Fr eemasonry. A certain degree of duplicity appears to enter into their scheme much re sembling that enjoined to the Ismaili Dais when enlisting proselytes belonging to ot her religions : thus in talking to Mohammedans, the Druses profess to be follo wers of the Prophet ; with Christians, they pretend to hold the doctrines of Christia nity, an attitude they defend on the score that it is unlawful to reveal the secret dogmas of their creed to a \"Black,\" or unbeliever. The Druses are in the habit of holding meetings where, as in the Dar ul Hikmat, both men and women assemble and religious and political questions are discussed ; the uninitiated, however, are allowed to exerci se no influence on decisions, which are reached by the inner circle, to which only th e \"Wise\" are admitted. The resemblance between this organization and that of Gra nd Orient Freemasonry is clearly apparent. The Druses also have modes of recogn ition which are common to Freemasonry, and M. Achille Laurent has observed : \" The formula or catechism of the Druses resembles that of the Freemasons ; one can learn it only from the Akals (or Akels = Intelligent, a small group of higher initiates ), who only reveal its mysteries after having subjected one to tests and made one take terrible oaths.\" I shall refer again later in this book to the a ffinity between the Druses and Freemasons of the Grand Orient. 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE ASSASSINS It will be seen that the Dr uses, distinguishing themselves from other Ismaili sects by their worship of Hakim, yet re taining genuine religious beli efs, had not carried on the atheistical tradition of A bdullah ibn Maymn and of the Grand Lodge of Cairo. But this tradition was to find in 1090 an exponent in the Persian Hasan Saba, a native of Khorasan, the son of Ali, a strict Shia h, who, finding himself suspected heretical ideas, ended by declaring himself a Sunni. Ha san brought up in this atmosphere of duplicity, was therefore well fitted to play th e Machiavellian rôle of an Ismaili Dai. Von Hammer regards Hasan as a mighty genius , one of a splendid triad, of which the two others were his schoolfellows the poet Omar Khayyám and Nizam ul Mulk, Grand Vizier under the Seljuk Sultan, Ma lik Shah. Hasan, having through the protection of Nizam ul Mulk secured titles a nd revenues and finally risen to office at the Court of the Sultan attempted to supplant his benefactor and eventually retired in disgrace, vowing vengeance against the Sulta n and vizier. At this juncture he encountered several Ismailis, one of whom , a Dai named Mumin, finally converted him to the principles of his sect, and Hasan, declaring himself now to be a convinced adherent of the Fatimite Khalifas, journeye d to Cairo, where he was received with honour by the Dar ul Hikmat and also by the Khalifa Mustansir, to whom he became counsellor. But his intrigues once more involv ing him in disgrace, he fled to Aleppo and laid the foundations of his new sect. After enlisting proselytes in Bagdad, Ispahan, Khusistan, and Damaghan, he succeeded in obtaining by strategy the fortress of Alamut in Persia on the Caspian Sea, wh ere he completed the plans for his great secret society which was to become for ever infamous under the name of the Hashishiyn, or Assassins. Under the pretence of belief in the doctrines of Islam and also of adherence to the Ismaili line of succession from the Prophet, Ha san Saba now set out to pave his way to power and in order to ach ieve this and adopted the sa me method as Abdullah ibn Maymn. But the terrible efficiency of Hasan' s society consisted in the fact that a system of physical force was now or ganized in a manner undreamt of by his predecessor. As von Hammer has observed in an admirable passage : Opinions are powerless, so long as they only confuse the brain, without arming the hand. Scepticism and free-thinking, as long as they occupied only the minds of the indolent and philosophical, have caused th e ruin of no throne, for which purpose religious and political fanaticism are the stronge st levers in the hands of nations. It is nothing to the ambitious man what people beli eve, but it is everyt hing to know how he may turn them for the execution of his projects.(6) Thus, as in the case of the French Revolu tion, \" whose first movers,\" von Hammer also observes, \" were the tool s or leaders of secret societ ies,\" it was not mere theory but the method of enlisting numerous dupes a nd placing weapons in their hands that brought about the \" Terror \" of the Assassins si x centuries before that of their spiritual descendants, the Jacobins of 1793. Taking as his groundwork the organization of the Grand Lodge of Cairo, Hasan reduced the nine degrees to their original number of seven, but these now received a definite nomenclature, and included not only real initiates but active agents. 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Descending downwards, the degrees of the Assassins were thus as follows : first, the Grand Master, known as the Shaikh-al-Jabal or \" Old Man of the Mountain \"--owing to the fact that the Order always possessed itself of castles in mountainous regions ; second, the Dail Kebir or Grand Priors; thir d, the fully initiated Dais, religious nuncios and political emissaries ; fourth, the Ra fiqs or associates, in training for the higher degrees ; fifth, the Fada is or \" devoted,\" who undertoo k to deliver the secret blow on which their superiors had decided; si xth, the Lasiqus, or lay brothers ; and lastly the \" common people,\" who were to be simply blind instruments. If the equivalents to the words \" Dai,\" \" Rafiqs ,\" and \" Fadais \" given by von Hammer and Dr. Bussell as \" Master Masons,\" \" Fellow Cr afts,\" and \" Entered Apprentices \" are accepted, an interesting analogy with th e degrees Freemasonry is provided. Designs against religion were, of course, not admitted by the Order ; \" strict uniformity to Islam was demanded from a ll the lower rank of uninitiated, but the adept was taught to see through the deception of ' faith and works.' He believed in nothing and recognized that all acts or means were indifferent and the (secular) end alone to be considered.\"(7) Thus the final object was domination by a few men consumed with the lust of power \" under the cloak of religion and piety,\" a nd the method by which this was to be established was the wholesale assass ination of those who opposed them. In order to stimulate the ener gy of the Fadais, who were re quired to carry out these crimes, the superiors of the Order had recour se to an ingenious system of delusion. Throughout the territory occupied by the Assass ins were exquisite gardens with fruit trees, bowers of roses, and sparkling stream s. Here are arranged luxurious resting- places with Persian carpets and soft diva ns, around which hovered black-eyed \" houris \" bearing wine in gold and silver drinking-ve ssels, whilst soft musi c mingled with the murmuring water and the song of birds. The young man whom the Assassins desired to train for a career of crime was introduced to the Grand Master of he Order and intoxicated with haschisch--hence the name \" Hashishiyn \" applied to the sect, from which the word assassin is derived. Under the brief spell of unconsciousness induced by this seductive drug the pros pective Fadai was then carried into the garden, where on awaking he believed himself to be in Pa radise. After enjoying all its delights he was given a fresh dose of the opiate, a nd, once more unconscious, was transported back to the presence of the Grand Master, w ho assured him that he had never left his side but had merely experienced a foretaste of the Paradise that awaited him if he obeyed the orders of his chiefs. The neophyte, thus spurred on by the belief that he was carrying out the commands of the Prophet, who would reward him with eternal bliss, eagerly entered into the schemes la id down for him and devoted his life to murder. Thus by the lure of Paradise the Assassins enlisted instruments for their criminal work and established a system of organized murder on a basis of religious fervour. \" ' Nothing is true and all is allowe d ' was the ground of th eir secret doctrine, which, however, being imparted but to few and concealed under the veil of the most austere religionism and piet y, restrained the mind under th e yoke of blind obedience.\" (8) To the outside world all this remained a profound mystery ; fidelity to Islam was proclaimed as the fundament al doctrine of the sect, and when the envoy of Sultan Sajar was sent to collect information on the religious beliefs of th e Order he was met with the assurance : \" We believe in the unity of God, and consider that only as true wisdom which accords with His word and the commands of the prophet.\" Von Hammer, answering the possible contention that, as in the case of the Templars and the Bavarian Illuminati these methods of deception might be declared a calumny 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"on the Order, points out that in the case of the Assassins no possible doubt existed, for their secret doctrines were eventually reve aled by the leaders themselves, first by Hasan II, the third successor of Hasan Sa ba, and later by Jalal-ud-din Hasan, who publicly anathematized the founders of the sect and ordered the burning of the books that contained their designs against religion--a proceeding which, however, appears to have been a strategical manoeuvre for restor ing confidence in the Order and enabling him to continue the work of subversion and crime. A veritable Reign of Terror was thus established throughout the East ; the Ra fiqs and Fadais \" spread themselves in troops over the whole of Asia and darkened the face of the earth \"; a nd \" in the annals of the Assassins is found th e chronological enumeration of celebrated men of all nations who have fallen the victims of the Is mailis to the joy of their murderers and the sorrow of the world.\"(9) Inevitably this long and systematic indulge nce in blood lust reco iled on the heads of the leaders, and the Assassins like the Terrorists of Fran ce, ended by turning on each other. The Old Man of the Mountain himself was murdered by his brother-in-law and his son Mohammed ; Mohammed, in his turn, wh ilst \" aiming at the life of his son Jalal-ud-din, was anticipated by him with poison, which mu rder was again avenged by poison \" so that from \" Hasan the Illuminato r \" down to the last of his line the Grand Masters fell by the hands of their next-of- kin, and \" poison and the dagger prepared the grave which the Order had opened fo r so many.\"(10) Finally in 1256 the conquering hordes of the Mongol Mangu Khan swept away the dynasty of the Assassins. But, although as reigning powers the Assassins and Fatimites ceased to exist, the sects from which they derived have continued up to the present day ; still every year at the celebration of the Moharram the Shiahs beat their breasts and besprinkle themselves with blood, calling aloud on the martyred heroes Hasan and Husain ; the Druses of the Lebanon still await the return of Hakim, and in that inscrutable East, the cradle of all the mysteries, the profoundest European ad ept of secret societ y intrigue may find himself outdistanced by pastmaster s in the art in which he believed himself proficient. The sect of Hasan Saba was the supreme model on which all systems of organized murder working through fanaticism, such as the Carbonari and the Irish Republican Brotherhood were based, and the signs, th e symbols, the initia tions, of the Grand Lodge of Cairo formed the groundwork for th e great secret societies of Europe. How came this system to be transported to the West ? By what channel did the ideas of these succeeding Eastern sects penetrate to the Christian world ? In order to answer this question we must turn to the history of the Crusades. 1.

It would appear then that de Sacy, in placing this account before his description of the Karmathites, was anticipating. The point is im material, the fact being th at the same system was common to all these ramifications of Ismailis, and that of the Dar ul Hikmat varied but little from that of Abdullah and Karmath. 5.

Baldwin II, w ho at this moment succeeded the throne of Jerusalem, presented them with a house near the site of the Temple of Solomon--hence the name of Kn ights Templar under which they were to become famous. In 1128 the Order was sa nctioned by the Council of Troyes and by the Pope, and a rule was drawn up by St. Bernard under which the Knights Templar were bound by the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. But although the Templars distinguished th emselves by many deeds of valour, the regulation that they we re to live solely on alms led to donations so enormous that, abandoning their vow of poverty, they spread themselves over Europe, and by the end of the twelfth century had become a rich and powerful body. The motto that the Order had inscribed upon its banner, \"Non nobis, Do mine, sed nomini tuo da gloriam,\" was likewise forgotten, for, their faith waxing gol d, they gave themselves up to pride and ostentation. Thus, as an eighteenth-cent ury masonic writer has expressed it: The war, which for the greater number of warriors of good faith pr oved the source of weariness, of losses and misfortunes, became for them (the Templars) only the opportunity for booty and aggrandizement, and if they distinguished themselves by a few brilliant actions, their motive soon ceased to be a matter of doubt when they were seen to enrich themselves even with the spo ils of the confederates , to increase their credit by the extent of the new possessions they had acquired, to carry arrogance to the point of rivalling crowned princes in pomp and grandeur, to refuse their aid against the enemies of the faith, as the history of Saladin testifies, and finally to ally themselves with that horrible and sangui nary prince named the Old Man of the Mountain Prince of the Assassins.(1) The truth of the last accusati on is, however, open to question. For a time, at any rate, the Templars had been at war with th e Assassins. When in 1152 the Assassins murdered Raymond, Comte de Tripoli, the Temp lars entered their te rritory and forced them to sign a treaty by which they were to pay a yearly tribut e of 12,000 gold pieces in expiation of the crime. Some years la ter the Old Man of the Mountain sent an ambassador to Amaury, King of Jerusalem, to tell him privately that if the Templars would forgo the payment of this tribute he and his followers would embrace the Christian faith. Amaury accepted, offering at the same time to compensate the Templars, but some of the Knights assassinate d the ambassador before he could return to his master. When asked for reparations the Grand Master threw the blame on an evil one-eyed Knight named Gautier de Maisnil.(2) It is evident, therefore, that the relations between the Templars a nd the Assassins were at first far from amicable ; neverthele ss, it appears probable that later on an understanding was brought about between them. Both on this charge and on that of treachery towards the Christian armies, Dr. Bussell's impartial view of the question 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"may be quoted: When in 1149 the Emperor Conrad III failed before Damascus, the Templars were believed to have a secret understanding with e garrison of that city ; . . . in 1154 they were said to have sold, for 60,000 gold pieces , a prince of Egypt who had wished to become a Christian ; he was taken home to suffer certain death at the hands his fanatical family. In 1166 Amaury, King of Jerusalem, hanged twelve members of the Order for betraying a fortress to Nureddin. And Dr. Bussell goes on to say that it cannot be disputed hat they had \" long and important dealings \" with the Assassin \" and were therefore suspected (not unfairly) of imbibing their precepts and following their principles.\"(3) By the end of the thirteenth century the Te mplars had become susp ect, not only in the eyes of the clergy, but of the general public. \" Amongst the common people,\" one of their latest apologists adm its, \" vague rumours circulated. They talked of the covetousness and want of scruple of the Kn ights, of their passion for aggrandizement and their rapacity. Their haughty insolence was proverbial. Drinking habits were attributed to them ; the saying was already in use ' to drink like a Templar.' The old German word Tempelhaus indicated house of ill-fame.\"(4) The same rumours had reached Clement V even before his accession to the papal throne in 1305,(5) and in this same year he summoned the Grand Master of the Order, Jacques du Molay, to return to France from the island of Cyprus, where he was assembling fresh forces to avenge the r ecent reverses of the Christian armies. Du Molay arrived in France with sixt y other Knights Templar and 150,000 gold florins, as well as a large quantity of silver that the Order had amassed in the East.(6) The Pope now set himself to make enquiries concerning the charges of \" unspeakable apostasy against God, detestable idolatry, execrable vice, and many heresies \" that had been \" secretly intimated \" to hi m. But, to quote his own words : Because it did not seem likely nor credible that men of such religion who were believed often to shed their blood and frequen tly expose their persons to the peril of death for Christ's name and who showed such great and many signs of devotion both in divine offices as well as in facts, as in other devotional obser vances, should be so forgetful of their salvation as to do these things, we were unwilling . . . to give ear to this kind of insinuation . . . (hujusmodi insinuacioni ac delacioni ipsorum . . . aurem noluimus inclinare).(7) The King of France, Philippe le Bel, who had hitherto been the friend of the Templars, now became alarmed and urged the Pope to take action against them ; but before the Pope was able to find out more about the matter, the King took the law into his own hands and had all the Templars in France arrested on October 13, 1307. The following charges were then brought against them by the Inquisitor for France before whom they were examined: 1. The ceremony of imitation into their Or der was accompanied by insults to the Cross, the denial of Christ, and gross obscenities. 2. The adoration of an idol which was sa id to be the image of the true God. 3. The omission of the words of consecration at Mass. 4. The right that the lay chiefs arrogate d to themselves of giving absolution. 5. The authorization of unnatural vice. To all these infamies a great number of the Knights, including Jacques du Molay, 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"confessed in almost precisely the same terms ; at their admission into the Order, they said, they had been shown the cross on which was the figure of Christ, and had been asked whether they believed in Him, when they answered yes, they were told in some cases that this was wrong (dixit sibi quod male credebat)(8) because He was not God, He was a false prophet (quia fa lsus propheta erat, nec erat Deus).(9) Some added that they were then shown an idol or a bearded head which they were told to worship(10); one added that this was of such \" a terrible aspect that it seemed to him to be the face of some devil, called in Fr ench un maufé, and that whenever he saw it he was so overcome with fear that he c ould hardly look at it without fear and trembling.\"(11) All who confessed declared that they had been ordered to spit on the crucifix, and very many that they had received the injuncti on to commit obscenities and to practise unnatural vice. Some said that on their refusal to carry out these orders they had been threatened with imprisonment, even perpet ual imprisonment ; a few said they had actually been incarcerated(12); one declared th at he had been terrorized, seized by the throat, and threatened with death.(13) Since, however, a number of these confessions were made under torture, it is more important to consider the evidence provided by the trial of the Knight s at the hands of the Pope, where this method was not employed. Now, at the time the Templars were arrested, Clement V, deeply resenting the King's interference with an Order wh ich existed entirely under papa l jurisdiction, wrote in the strongest terms of remonstr ance to Philippe le Bel urgi ng their release and even after their trial, neither the confessions of the Knights nor the angry expostu lations of the King could persuade him to believe in their guilt.(14) But as the scandal concerning the Templars was increasing, he c onsented to receive in private audience \" a certain Knight of the Order, of great nobil ity and held by the said Order in no slight esteem,\" who testified to the abominations that took place on the reception of the Brethren, the spitting on th e cross, and other things which were not lawful nor, humanly speaking, decent.(15) The Pope then decided to hold an examina tion of seventy-two French Knights at Poictiers in order to discover whether th e confessions made by them before the Inquisitor at Paris could be substantiated, and at this ex amination, conducted without torture or pressure of any kind in the pres ence of the Pope himself, the witnesses declared on oath that they would tell \" the full and pure truth.\" They then made confession which were committed to writing in their presence, and these being afterwards read aloud to them, they expressly and willingly approved them (perseverantes in illis eas expresse et spont e, prout recitate fuer unt approbarunt).(16) Besides this, an examination of the Gr and Master, Jacques du Molay, and the Preceptors of the Order was held in the pres ence of \" three Cardinals and four public notaries and .many other good men.\" These witn esses, says the official report, \" having sworn with their hands on the Gospel of God \" (ad sancta de i evangelia ab iis corporaliter tacta) that-- th ey would on all the aforesaid th ings speak the pure and full truth, they, separately, freely, and spontan eously, without any coercion and fear, deposed and confessed among other things, the a denial of Ch rist and spitting upon the cross when they were received into th e Order of the Temple. And some of them (deposed and confessed) that under the same form, namely, with denial of Christ and spitting on the cross, they had received many Brothers into the Order. Some of them too confessed certain other horrible and disgus ting things on which we are silent. . . . 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Besides this, they said and confessed that those things which are contained in the confessions and depositions of heretical depravity which they made lately before the Inquisitor (of Paris) were true. Their confessions, being again committed to writing, were approved by the witnesses, who then with bended knees and many tears asked for and obtaine d absolution.(17) The Pope, however, still refused to take action against the whole Order merely because the Master and Brethren around him had \" gravely sinned,\" and it was decided to hold a papal commission in Paris. The first sitting t ook place in November 1309, when the Grand Master and 231 Knights were summoned before the pontifical commissioners. \" This enquiry,\" says Michelet, \" was conducted slowly, with much consideration and gentleness (avec beaucoup de ménagement et de douceur) by high ecclesiastical dignitaries, an archbishop, several bishops, etc.\"(18) But although a number of the Knights, including the Gra nd Master, now retracted their admissions, some damning confessions were again forthc oming. It is impossible within the scope of this book to follow the many trials of th e Templars that took place in different countries--in Italy, at Ravenna, Pisa, Bologna, and Florence, where torture was not employed and blasphemies were admitted,(19) or in Germany, where torture was employed but no confessions were made and a verdict was given in favour of the Order. A few details concerning the trial in England may, however, be of interest. It has generally been held that torture was not applied in England owing to the humanity of Edward II, who at first, absolu tely refused to listen to any accusations against the Order.(20) On December 10, 1307, he had written to the Pope in these terms: And because the said Master or Brethr en constant in the purity of he Catholic faith have been frequently commended by us, and by all our ki ngdom, both in their life and morals, we are unable to believe in suspicious stories of this kind until we know with greater certainty about these things. We, therefore, pity from our souls the su ffering and losses of the Sd. Master and brethren, which they suffer in consequence of such infamy, and we supplicate most affectionately your Sanctity if it please you, that considering with favour suited to the good character of the Master and brethren, you may deem fit to meet with more indulgence the detractions, calumnies a nd charges by certain envious and evil disposed persons, who endeavour to turn th eir good deeds into works of perverseness opposed to divine teaching ; until the said char ges attributed to them shall have been brought legally before you or your representa tives here and more fully proved.(21) Edward II also wrote in the same terms to the Kings of Portugal, Castile, Aragon, and Sicily. But two years later, after Clement V had himself heard the confessions of the Order and a Papal Bull had been issued decl aring that \" the unspeakable wickednesses and abominable crimes of notorious heresy \" had now \" come to the knowledge of almost everyone,\" Edward II was persuaded to arrest the Templars and order their examination. According to Mr. Castle, whose interesting treatise we quote here, the King would not allow torture to be employed, w ith the result that the Knights denied all charges ; but later, it is said, he allowe d himself to be overpersuaded, and torture appears to have been applied on one or two occasions \"(22) with the result that three Knights confessed to all and were given ab solution.(23) At Southwark, however, \" a considerable number of brethren \" admitted that \" they had been strongly accused of the crimes of negation and spitting, they did not say they were guilty but that they could not purge themselves . . . and ther efore they abjured these and all other heresies.\"(24) Evidence was also given ag ainst the Order by outside witnesses, and 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"the same stories of intimidation at the ceremony of reception were told.(25) At any rate, the result of the investigation was not altogether satisfactory, and the Templars were finally suppressed in England as el sewhere by the Council of Vienne in 1312. In France more rigorous measures were adopted and fifty-four Knights who had retracted their confessions were burnt at th e stake as \" relapsed heretics \" on May 12, 1310. Four years later, on March 14, 1314, the Grand Master, Jacques du Molay, suffered the same fate. Now, however much we must execrate the ba rbarity of this sent ence--as also the cruelties that had preceded it--this is no reason why we should admit the claim of the Order to noble martyrdom put forward by the historians who have espoused their cause. The character of the Templars is not rehabilitated by condemning the conduct of the King and Pope. Yet this the line of argument usually adopt ed by the defenders of the Order. Thus the two main contentions on which they base their defence are, firstly, that the confessions of the Knights were made unde r torture, therefore they must be regarded as null and void ; and, sec ondly, that the whole affair was a plot concerted between the King and Pope in order to obtain possession of the Templars' riches. Let us examine these contentions in turn. In the first place, as we have seen, all c onfessions were not made under torture. No one, as far as I am aware, disputes Michelet 's assertion that the enquiry before the Papal Commission in Paris, at which a number of Knights adhered to the statements they had made to the Pope, was conducted w ithout pressure of a ny kind. But further, the fact that confessions are made under tort ure does not necessarily invalidate them as evidence. Guy Fawkes also confessed under torture, yet it is never suggested that the whole story of the Gunpowder Plot was a myth. Torture, however much we may condemn it, has frequently proved the only method for overcoming the intimidation exercised over the mind of a conspirator ; a man bound by the terrible obligations of a confederacy and fearing the vengeance of hi s fellow-conspirators will not readily yield to persuasion, but only to force. If, th en, some of the Templa rs were terrorized by torture, or even by the fear of torture, it must not be forgotten that terrorism was exercised by both sides. Few will deny th at the Knights were bound by oaths of secrecy, so that on one hand they were threat ened with the vengeance of the Order if they betrayed its secrets, and on the other faced with torture if they refused to confess. Thus they found themselves between the devil and the deep sea. It was therefore not a case of a mild and unoffending Order meeting w ith brutal treatment at the hands of authority, but of the victims of a terrible au tocracy being delivered into the hands of another autocracy. Moreover, do the confessions of the Kni ghts appear to be the outcome of pure imagination such as men under the influence of torture might devise ? It is certainly difficult to believe that the accounts of th e ceremony of initiation given in detail by men in different countries, all closely resembling each other, yet related in different phraseology, could be pure inventions. Had th e victims been driven to invent they would surely have contradicted each other, ha ve cried out in their agony that all kinds of wild and fantastic rites had taken place in order to sa tisfy the demands of their interlocutors. But no, each appears to be describing the same ceremony more or less completely, with characteristic touches that indicate the personality of the speaker, and in the main all the stories tally. 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The further contention that the case agains t the Templars was manufactured by the King and Pope with a view to obtaining their wealth is entirely disproved by facts. The latest French historian of mediæval France, whilst expressing disbelief in the guilt of the Templars, characterizes this c ounter-accusation as \" puerile.\" \" Philippe the Bel,\" writes M. Funck-Brentano, \" has ne ver been understood ; from the beginning people have not been just to him. This young prince was one of the greatest kings and the noblest characters that have appeared in history.\"(26) Without carrying appreciation so far, one must nevertheless accord to M. Funck- Brentano's statement of facts the attention it merits. Philippe has been blamed for debasing the coin of the realm ; in reality he merely ordered it to be mixed with alloy ; as a necessary measure after the war with England,(27) prec isely as our own coinage was debased in consequence of the recent war. This was done quite openly and the coinage was restored at the earliest opport unity. Intensely national, his policy of attacking the Lombards, exiling the Jews , and suppressing the Templars, however regrettable the methods by which it was carried out, resulted in immense benefits to France ; M. Funck-Brentano has graphically described the prosperity of the whole country during the early fourteenth centur y--the increase of population, flourishing agriculture and industry. \" In Provence and Languedoc one meets swineherds who have vineyards, simple cowherds who have town houses.\"(28) The attitude of Philippe le Bel towards the Templars must be viewed in this light-- ruthless suppression of any body of people who interfered with the prosperity of France. His action was not that of arbitrar y authority ; he \" proceeded,\" says M. Funck-Brentano, \" by means of an appeal to the people. In his name Nogaret (the Chancellor) spoke to the Parisians in the garden of the Palace (October 13, 1307). Popular assemblies were convoked all over France \" ;(29) \" the Parlia ment of Tours, with hardly a dissentient vote, declared the Templars wort hy of death. The University of Paris gave the weight of their judgement as to the fullness and authenticity of the confessions.\"(30) Even assuming that these bodies were actuated by the same servility as that which has been attributed to the Pope, how are we to explain the fact that the trial of the Order aroused no opposition among the far from docile people of Paris ? If the Templars had indeed, as they professe d, been leading noble and upright lives, devoting themselves to the care of the poor, one might surely expect th eir arrest to be followed by popular risings. But there app ears to have been no sign of this. As to the Pope, we have already seen th at from the outset he had shown himself extremely reluctant to condemn the Order, a nd no satisfactory explanation is given of his change of attitude except that he wished to please the King. As far a his own interests are concerned, it is obvious that he could have nothing to gain by publishing to the world a scandal that must inev itably bring opprobrium on the Church. His lamentations to this effect in the famous Bu ll (31) clearly show that he recognized this danger and therefore desired at all cost to clear the accused Knights, if evidence could be obtained in their favour. It was only wh en the Templars made damning admissions in his presence that he was obliged to abandon their defence.(32) Yet we are told that he did this out of base compliance wi th the wishes of Philippe le Bel. Philippe le Bel is thus represented as th e arch-villain of th e whole piece, through seven long years hounding down a blameless Order--from whom up to the very moment of their arrest he had repeatedly received loans of money--solely with the object of appropriating their wealth. Yet after all we find that the property of the Templars was not appropriated by the King, but was given by him to the Knights of 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"St. John of Jerusalem ! What was the fate of the Templars' goods ? Philippe le Bel decide d that they should be handed over to the Hospitallers. Clement V states that the Orders given by the King on this subject were executed. Even the do main of the Temple in Paris . . . up to the eve of the Revolution was the property of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. The royal treasury kept for itself certain sums for the costs of the trial. These had been immense.(33) These facts in no way daunt the antagonists of Philippe, who, we are now assured-- again without any proof whatever--was overru led by the Pope in this matter. But setting all morality aside, as a mere question of policy, is it likely that the King would have deprived himself of his most valuable financial supporters and gone to the immense trouble of bringing them to trial wit hout first assuring himself that he would benefit by the affair ? Would he, in other wo rds, have killed the goose that laid the golden eggs without any guarantee that th e body of the goose would remain in his possession ? Again, if, as we are told, the Pope suppressed the Order so as to please the King, why should he have thwarted him over the whole purpose the King had in view ? Might we not expect indignant rem onstrances from Philippe at thus being baulked of the booty he had toiled so long to gain ? But on the contrary, we find him completely in agreement with the Pope on this subject. In November 1309 Clement V distinctly stated that \" Philippe the Illust rious, King of France,\" to whom the facts concerning the Templars had been told, was \" not prompted by avarice since he desired to keep or appropriat e for himself no part of the pr operty of the Templars, but liberally and devotedly left them to us and the Church to be admi nistered,\" etc.(34) Thus the whole theory concer ning the object for which the Templars were suppressed falls to the ground--a theory which on examin ation is seen to be built up entirely on the plan of imputing motives without any jus tification in facts. The King acted from cupidity, the Pope from servility, and the Temp lars confessed from fear of torture--on these pure hypotheses defenders of th e Order base their arguments. The truth is, far more probably, that if the King had any additional reason for suppressing the Templars it was not envy of their wealth but fear of the immense power their wealth conferred ; the Order dared even to defy the King and to refuse to pay taxes. The Temple in fact constituted an imperium in imperio that threatened not only the royal authority but the whole social system.(35) An important light is thrown on the situation by M. Funck-Br entano in this passage : As the Templars had houses in all c ountries, they practised the financial operations of the internati onal banks of our times ; th ey were acquainted with letters of change, orders payable at sight, they instituted dividends and annuities on deposited capital, advanced funds, lent on credit, controlled private accounts, undertook to raise taxes for the lay an d ecclesiastical seigneurs.(36) Through their proficiency in th ese matters--acquired very possibly from the Jews of Alexandria whom they must have met in the East--the Templars had become the \" international financiers \" and \" international capitalists \" of their day ; had they not been suppressed, all the evils now denounced by Socialists as peculiar to the system they describe as \" Capitalism \"--trusts, monopolies, and \" corners \"--would in all probability have been inaugurated during the co urse of the fourteenth century in a far worse form than at the present day, since no legislation existed to protect the community at large. The feudal system, as Marx and Engels perceived, was the principal obstacle to exploitation by a financial autocracy.(37) 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Moreover, it is by no means improbable that this order of things would have been brought about by the violent overthrow of the French monarchy--indeed, of all monarchies ; the Templars, \" those terribl e conspirators,\" says Eliphas Lévi, threatened the whole world with an immense revolution.\"(38) Here perhaps we may find the reason why th is band of dissolute and rapacious nobles has enlisted the passionate sympathy of demo cratic writers. For it will be noticed that these same writers who attribute the King' s condemnation of the Order to envy of their wealth never apply this argument to the demagogues of the eighteenth century and suggest that their accusations against the nobles of France were inspired by cupidity, nor would they ever admit that a ny such motive may enter into the diatribes against private owners of w ealth to-day. The Templars thus remain the only body of capitalists, with the exception of the Jews, to be not only pardoned for their riches but exalted as noble victims of prejudice and envy. Is it merely because the Templars were the enemies of monarchy ? Or is it th at the world revoluti on, whilst attacking private owners of property, has never been opposed to Intern ational finance, particularly when combined with anti-Christian tendencies ? It is the continued defence of the Templars which, to the present writer, appears the most convincing evidence against them. For ev en if one believes them innocent of the crimes laid to their charge, how is it possible to admire them in their later stages ? The fact that cannot be denied is that they were false to their obligations , that they took the vow of poverty and then grew not only rich bu t arrogant ; that th ey took the vow of chastity and became notoriously immoral.(3 9) Are all these things then condoned because the Templars formed a link in the chain of world revolution ? At this distance of time the guilt or innocence of the Templars will probably never be conclusively established either way ; on the mass of conflicting evidence bequeathed to us by history no one can pronounce a final judgement. Without attempting to dogmatize on the questi on, I would suggest that the real truth may be that the Knights were both innocent a nd guilty, that is to say, that a certain number were initiated into the secret doc trine of the Order whilst the majority remained throughout in ignorance. Thus according to the evidence of Stephen de Stapelbrugge, an English Knight, \" there were two modes of recep tion, one lawful and good and the other contrary to the Faith.\"(40) This woul d account for the fact that some of the accused declined to confess ev en under the greatest pressure. These may really have known nothing of the real doctrin es of the Order, which were confided orally only to those whom the superiors rega rded as unlikely to be revolted by them. Such have always been the methods of secret societies, from the Ismailis onward. This theory of a double doctrine is put forward by Loiseleur, who observes : If we consult the statutes of the Order of th e Temple as they have come down to us, we shall certainly discover there is nothing that justifies the strange and abominable practices revealed at the I nquiry. But . . . besides the public rule, had not the Order another one, whether traditional or written, authorizing or even prescribing these practices--a secret rule, revealed only to the initiates ?(41) Eliphas Lévi also exonerates the majority of the Templars from complicity in either anti-monarchical or anti-religious designs : These tendencies were enveloped in profound mystery and the Order made an out ward profession of the most perfect orthodoxy. The Chiefs alone knew whither hey were going ; the rest followed 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"unsuspectingly.(42) What, then, was the Templar heresy ? On th is point we find a variety of opinions. According to Wilcke, Ranke, and Weber it wa s \" the unitarian deism of Islam \"(43); Lecouteulx de Canteleu thinks, however, it was derived from heretical Islamic sources, and relates that whilst in Palestine, one of the Knights, Guillaume de Montbard, was initiated by the Old Man of the Mountain in a cave of Mount Lebanon.(44) That a certain resemblance ex isted between the Templars and the Assassins has been indicated by von Hamm er,(45) and further emphasized by the Freemason Clavel : Oriental hi storians show us, at differe nt periods, the Order of the Templars maintaining intimate relations with that of the Assassins, and they insist on the affinity that existed between the two associations. They remark that they had adopted the same colours, white and red ; that they had the same organization, the same hierarchy of degrees, those of fedavi, refik, and dai in one corresponding to those of novice, professed, and knight in the other ; that bot h conspired for the ruin of the religions they professed in public, and that finally both possessed numerous castles, the former in Asia, the latter in Europe.(46) But in spite of these outward resemblances it does not appear from the confessions of the Knights that the secret doctrine of the Te mplars was that of the Assassins or of any Ismaili sect by which, in accordance with orthodox Islamism, Jesus was openly held up as a prophet, although, secretly, indi fference to all religion was inculcated. The Templars, as far as can be discovere d, were anti-Christian deists ; Loiseleur considers that their ideas were derived from Gnostic or Manichean dualists--Cathari, Paulicians, or more particularly Bogomils, of which a brief account must be given here. The Paulicians who flourished about the seve nth century A.D., bore a resemblance to the Cainites and Ophites in their detestation of the Demiurgus and in the corruption of their morals. Later, in the ninth centur y, the Bogomils, whose name signifies in Slavonic \" friends of God,\" and who had migrated from Northern Syria and Mesopotamia to the Balkan Peninsula, particularly Thrace, appeared as a further development of Manichean dualism. Their doctrine may be summarized thus : God, the Supreme Father, has two sons, the elder Satanael, the younger Jesus. To Satanael, who sat on the right hand of G od, belonged the right of governing the celestial world, but, filled with pride, he rebelle d against his Father and fell from Heaven. Then, aided by the companions of his fall, he created the visible world, image of the celestial, havi ng like the other its sun, moon, and stars, and last he created man and the serpent wh ich became his minister. Later Christ came to earth in order to show men the way to Heaven, but His death was ineffectual, for even by descending into Hell He could not wrest the power from Sata nael, i.e. Satan. This belief in the impotence of Christ and the necessity therefore for placating Satan, not only \" the Prince of this world,\" but its creator, led to the further doctrine that Satan, being all-powerful, shoul d be adored. Nicetas Choniat es, a Byzantine historian of the twelfth century, described the followers of this cult as \" Satanists,\" because \"considering Satan all-powerful they worshi pped him lest he might do them harm\"; subsequently they were known as Luciferians, their doctrine (as stated by Neuss and Vitoduranus) being that Lucifer was unjustly driven out of Heaven, that one day he will ascend there again and be restored to his former glory and power in the celestial world. 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Bogomils and Luciferians were thus cl osely akin, but whilst the former divided their worship between God and His two sons, the latter worshipped Lucifer only, regarding the material world as his work and holding that by indul ging the flesh they were propitiating their Demon-Creator. It wa s said that a black cat, the symbol of Satan, figured in their ceremonies as an object of worship, also that at their horrible nocturnal orgies sacrifices of children were made and their blood used for making the Eucharistic bread of the sect.(47) Loiseleur arrives at the conclusion that th e secret doctrine of the Templars was derived from the Bogomils : Thus the Templars recognize at the same time a good god, incommunicable to man and consequently without symbolic representation, and a bad god, to whom they give the features of an idol of fearful aspect.(48) Their most fervent worship was addressed to this god of evil, who alone could enrich them. \" They said with the Luciferians : ' The elder son of God, Satanael or Lucifer alone has a right to the ho mage of mortals ; Jesus hi s younger brother does not deserve this honour.' \"(49) Although we shall not find these ideas so clearly defined in the confessions of the Knights, some colour is lent to this theo ry by those who related that the reason given to them for not believing in Christ was \" that He was nothing, He was a false prophet and of no value, and that they should believe in the Higher God of Heaven who could save them.\"(50) According to Loiseleur, th e idol they were taught to worship, the bearded head known to history as Baphomet, re presented \" the inferior god, organizer and dominator of the material world, aut hor of good and evil here below, him by whom evil was introduced into creation.\"(51) The etymology of the word Baphomet is diffi cult to discover ; Raynouard says it originated with two witn esses heard at Carcassonn e who spoke of \" Figura Baffometi,\" and suggests hat it was a corruption of \" Mohammed,\" whom the Inquisitors wished to make the Knights c onfess they were taught to adore.(52) But this surmise with regard to the in tentions of he Inquisitors seems highly improbable, since they must have been we ll aware that, as Wilcke points out, the Moslems forbid all idols.(53) For th is reason Wilcke concludes that the Mohammedanism of the Templars was combined with Cabalism and that their idol was in reality the macroprosopos, or head of the Ancient of Ancients, represented as an old man with a long beard, or sometimes as three heads in one, which has already been referred to under the name of the Long Face in the first chapter of this book--a theory which would agree with Eliphas Lé vi's assertion that the Templars were initiated into the mysterious doctrines of the Cabala.\"(54) But Lévi goes on to define this teaching under the name of Johannism. It is here that we reach a further theory with regard to the secret doctrine of the Templars--the most important of all, since it emanates from masonic and neo-Templar sour ces, thus effectually disposing of the contention that the charge brought against th e Order of apostasy from the Catholic faith is solely the invention of Catholic writers. In 1842 the Freemason Ragon related that the Templars learnt from the \" initiates of the East \" a certain Judaic doctrine which was attributed to St. John the Apostle ; 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"therefore \" they renounced the religion of St. Peter and became Johannites.(55) Eliphas Lévi expresses the same opinion. Now, these statements are apparently f ounded on a legend which was first published early in the nineteenth century, when an a ssociation calling itself the Ordre du Temple and claiming direct descent from the origin al Templar Order published two works, the Manuel des Chevaliers de l'Ordre du Te mple in 1811, and the Lévitikon, in 1831, together with a version of the Gospel of St. John differing from the Vulgate. These books, which appear to have been printed on ly for private circulation amongst the members and are now extremely rare, relate that the Order of the Temple had never ceased to exist since the days of Jac ques du Molay, who appointed Jacques de Larménie his successor in office, and from th at time onwards a line of Grand Masters had succeeded each other without a break up to the end of the eighteenth century, when it ceased for a brief period but was reinstituted under a new Grand Master, Fabré Palaprat, in 1804. Besides publishing the list of all Grand Masters, known as the \" Charter of Larmenius,\" said to have been preserved in the secret archives of the Temple, these works also reproduce another document drawn from the same repository describing the origins of the Orde r. This manuscript, written in Greek on parchment, dated 1154, purports to be partly taken from a fifth-century MS. and relates that Hugues de Payens, first Grand Ma ster of the Templars , was initiated in 1118--that is to say, in the y ear the Order was founded--into the religious doctrine of \" the Primitive Christian Church\" by its Sove reign Pontiff and Patriarch, Theoclet, sixtieth in direct succession from St. John the Apostle. The history of the Primitive Church is then given as follows : Moses was initiated in Egypt. Profoundly vers ed in the physical, theological, and metaphysical mysteries of the priests, he knew how to profit by these so as to surmount the power of the Mages and deliver his companions. Aaron, his brother, and the chiefs of the Hebrews became the depositaries of his doctrine. . . . The Son of God afterwards a ppeared on the scene of the world. . . . He was brought up at the school of Alexandria. . . . Imbued with a spirit wholly di vine, endowed with the most astounding qualities (dispositions), he was able to reach all the degrees of Egyptian initiation. On his return to Jerusalem, he presented himself before the chiefs of the Synagogue. . . . Jesus Christ, directing the fruit of his lofty meditations towards universal civilization and the happiness of th e world, rent the veil which concealed the truth from the peoples. He preached the love of God, the love of one's neighbour, and equality before the common Father of all men. . . . Jesus conferred evangelical initiation on his apostles and disciples. He transmitted his spirit to them, divided them into several order after the practice of John, the beloved disciple the apostle of fraternal love, wh om he had instituted Sovereign Pontiff and Patriarch. . . . Here we have the whole Cabalistic legend of a secret doctrine descending from Moses, of Christ as an Egyptian initiate a nd founder of a secret order--a theory, of course, absolutely destructive of belief in His divinity. The legend of the Ordre du Temple goes on to say : Up to about the ye ar 1118 (i.e. the year the Order of the Temple was founded) the mysteries and the hierarchic Order of the initiation of Egypt, transmitted to the Jews by Moses, then to the Christians by J.C., were religiously preserved by the successors of St. John the Apostle. These mysteries and 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"initiations, regenerated by the evangelical in itiation (or baptism), were a sacred trust which the simplicity of the primitive and unchanging morality of the Brothers of the East had preserved from all adulteration. . . . The Christians, persecuted by the infidels, a ppreciating the courage and piety of these brave crusaders, who, with the sword in one ha nd and the cross in the other, flew to the defence of the holy places, and, above all, doing striking justice to the virtues and the ardent charity of Hugues de Payens, held it their duty to confide to hands so pure the treasures of knowledge acquired throughout so many centuries, sanctified by the cross, the dogma and the morality of the Man-God. Hugues was invested with the Apostolic Patriarchal power and placed in the legitimate order of the successors of St. John the apostle or the evangelist. Such is the origin of the foundation of the Order of the Temple and of the fusion in this Order of the different kinds of initiati on of the Christians of the East designated under the title of Primitive Ch ristians or Johannites. It will be seen at once that all this story is subtly subversive of true Christianity, and that the appellation of Christ ians applied to the Johannite s is an imposture. Indeed Fabré Palaprat, Grand Master of the Ordre du Temple in 1804, who in his book on the Templars repeats the story contained in the Lévitikon and the Manuel des Chevaliers du Temple, whilst making the same profession of \" primitive Christian \" doctrines descending from St. John through Theoclet and Hugues de Payens to the Order over which he presides, goes on to say that the secret doctrine of the Templars \" was essentially contrary to the ca nons of the Church of Rome a nd that it is principally to this fact that one must attribute the pers ecution of which history has preserved the memory.\"(56) The belief of the Primitive Christians, and consequently that of the Templars, with regard to the miracles of Ch rist is that He \" did or may have done extraordinary or miraculous things,\" and that since \" God can do things incomprehensible to human intelligence,\" the Primitive Church venerates \" all the acts of Christ as they are described in the Gosp el, whether it considers them as acts human science or whether as acts of divine power.\"(57) Belief in the divinity of Christ is thus left an open question, and the same attitude is maintained towards the Resurrection, of which the story is omitted in the Gospel of St. John possessed by the Order. Fabré Palaprat further admits that the gravest ac cusations brought against the Templars were founded on facts which he attempts to explain away in the following manner : The Templars having in 1307 carefully abstra cted all the manuscripts composing the secret archives of the Order from the sear ch made by authority, and these authentic manuscripts having been preciously preserved since that period, we have to-day the certainty that the Knights endured a great num ber of religious and moral trials before reaching the different degrees of initiation : thus, for example, the recipient might receive the injunction under pain of death to trample on the cr ucifix or to worship an idol, but if he yielded to the terror which they sought to inspire in him he was declared unworthy of being admitted to the higher grades of the Order. One can imagine in this way how beings, too feeble or too immoral to endure the trials of initiation, may have accused the Templars of giving themselves up to infamous practices and of having superstitious beliefs. It is certainly not surprising that an Order which gave such injunctions as these, for whatever purpose, should have b ecome the object of suspicion. 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Eliphas Lévi, who, like Ragon, accepts the statements of the Ordre du Temple concerning the \" Johannite \" origin of the Templars' secret doctrine, is, however, not deceived by these professions of Christianit y, and boldly asserts that the Sovereign Pontiff Theoclet initiated Hugues de Payens \" into the mysteries and hopes of his pretended Church, he lured him by the ideas of sacerdotal sovereignty and supreme royalty, he indicated him finally as his successor. So the Order of the Knights of the Temple was stained from its origin with schism and conspiracy against Kings.\"(58) Further, Lévi relates that the real story told to initiates concerni ng Christ was no other than the infamous Toledot Yeshu described in the first chapte r of this book, and which the Johannites dared to attribute to St. John.(59) This would accord with the confession of the Catalonian Knight Templa r, Galcerandus de Teus, who stated that the form of absolution in the Order was : \" I pray God that He may pardon your sins as He pardoned St. Mary Magdalene and the thief on the cross \" ; but the witness went on to explain : By the thief of which the head of the Ch apter speaks, is meant, according to our statutes, that Jesus or Christ who was crucified by the Jews because he was not God, and yet he said he was God and the King of th e Jews, which was an outrage to the true God who is in Heaven. When Jesus, a few moments before his death, had his side pieced by the lance of Longinus, he repented of having called himself God and King of the Jews and he asked pardon of the true God ; then the true God pardoned him. It is thus that we apply to th e crucified Christ these words : \" as God pardoned the thief on the cross.\"(60) Raynouard, who quotes this deposition, stigmatiz es it as \" singular and extravagant\"; M. Matter agrees that it is doubtless extravagant, but that \" it merits attention. There was a whole system there, which was not the invention of Alternant.\"(61) Eliphas Lévi provides the clue to that system and to the reason why Christ was described as a thief, by indicating the Cabalistic legend wherein He was described as having stolen the sacred Name from the Holy of Holies. Elsewhere he explains that the Johannites \"made themselves out to be the only people in itiated into the true mysteries of the religion of the Saviour. They professed to know the real history of Jesus Christ, and by adopting part of Jewish traditions and the stories of the Talmud, they made out that the facts related in the Gosp els \"--that is to say, the Go spels accepted by the orthodox Church-- \"were only allegories of which St. John gives the key.\"(62) But it is time to pass from legend to facts. Fo r the whole story of th e initiation of the Templars by the \"Johannites \"rests principally on the documents produced by the Ordre du Temple in 1811. According to the Abbés Grégoire and Münter the authenticity and antiquity of these documen ts are beyond dispute. Grégoire, referring to the parchment manuscript of the Léviti kon and Gospel of St. John, says that \"Hellenists versed in palaeography believe th is manuscript to be of the thirteenth century, others declare it to be earlier and to go back to the eleventh century.\"(63) Matter, on the other hand, quoting Münter's opinion that the manuscripts in the archives of the modern Templars date from th e thirteenth century, observes that this is all a tissue of errors and that the critics, including the learned Professor Thilo of Halle, have recognized that the manuscript in question, far from belonging to the thirteenth century, da tes from the beginning of the ei ghteenth. From the arrangement of the chapters of the Gospel, M. Matter arri ves at the conclusion th at it was intended to accompany the ceremonies of some masoni c or secret society.(64) We shall return to this possibility in a later chapter. 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The antiquity of the manuscript containing th e history of the Templars thus remains an open question on which no one can pronounce an opinion without having seen the original. In order, then, to judge of the probabili ty of the story that this manuscript contained it is necessary to consult the facts of history and to discover what proof can be found that any such sect as the Johannites existed at the time of the Crusades or earlier. Certainly none is known to have been called by this name or by one resembling it before 1622, when some Portugue se monks reported the existence of a sect whom they described as \"Christians of St. John \"inhabiting the banks of the Euphrates. The appellation appears, however , to have been wrongly applied by the monks, for the sectarians in question, vari ously known as the Ma ndæans, Mandaites, Sabians, Nazoreans, etc. called themselves Mand aï Iyahi, that is to say, the disciples, or rather the wise men, of John, the word mandaï being derived from the Chaldean word manda, corresponding to the Greek word , or wisdom.(65) The multiplicity of names given to the Mandæans arises apparently from the fact that in their dealings with other communities they took the name of Sabians, whilst they called the wise and learned amongst themselves Nazoreans. (66) The sect formerly inhabited the banks of the Jordan, but was driven out by the Moslems, who forced them to retire to Mesopotamia and Babylonia, where they par ticularly affected the neighbourhood of rivers in order to be able to carry out their peculiar baptismal rites.(67) There can be no doubt that the doctrines of the Mandæans do resemble the description of the Johannite heresy as given by Elipha s Lévi, though not by th e Ordre du Temple, in that, the Mandæans professed to be the di sciples of St. John--the Baptist, however, not the Apostle--but were at th e same time, the enemies of Jesus Christ. According to the Mandæans' Book of John (Sidra d'Yahya), Yahya, that is to say, St. John, baptized myriads of men during forty years in the Jo rdan. By a mistake--or in response to a written mandate from heaven saying, \" Yahya , baptize the liar in the Jordan \"--he baptized the false prophet Yishu Meshiha (the Messiah Jesus), son of the devil Ruha Kadishta.(68) The same idea is found in anot her book of the sect called the \"Book of Adam,\" which represents Jesus as the pe rverter of St. John's doctrine and the disseminator of iniquity and perfidy th roughout the world.(69) The resemblance between all this and the legends of the Ta lmud, the Cabala, and the Toledot Yeshu is at once apparent ; moreover, the Mandæans claim for the \"Book of Adam \" the same origin as the Jews claimed for the Cabala , namely, that it was delivered to Adam by God through the hands of the angel Razael.(70) This book, known to scholars as the Codex Nasarous, is described by Münter as \" a sort of mosaic wit hout order, without method, where one finds mentioned Noah, Abra ham, Moses, Solomon, the Temple of Jerusalem, St. John the Baptist, Jesus Chri st, the Christians, and Mohammed.\" M. Matter, whilst denying any proof of the Templar succession from the Mandæans, nevertheless gives good reason for believing that the sect itself existed from the first centuries of the Christian er a and that its books dated from the eighth century(71) ; further that these Mandæans or Nazorean s--not to be confounded with the pre- Christian Nazarenes or Christian Nazarene s--were Jews who revered St. John the Baptist as the prophet of anci ent Mosaism, but regarded Jesus Christ as a false Messiah sent by the powers of darkness.(72) Modern Jewish opinion confirms this affirmation of Judaic inspiration and agrees with Matter in describing the Mandæans as Gnostics: \"Their sacred books are in an Aramaic dialect, which has close affinities with that of the Talmud of Babylon.\" The Jewish influence is distinctly visible in the Mandæan religion. It is essentia lly of the type of ancient Gnosticism, traces of which are found in the Talmud, the Midrash, and in a modified form the later Cabala.\"(73) 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"It may then be regarded as certain that a sect existed long before the time of the Crusades corresponding to the description of the Johannites given by Eliphas Lévi in that it was Cabalistic, anti-C hristian, yet profe ssedly founded on the doctrines of one of the St. Johns. Whether it was by this sect that the Templars were indoctrinated must remain an open question. M. Matter objec ts that the evidence lacking to such a conclusion lies in the fact that the Templars expressed no particular reverence for St. John ; but Loiseleur asserts that the Templars did prefer the Gospel of St. John to that of the other evangelists, and that modern masonic lodges claiming descent from the Templars possess a special version of this Gosp el said to have been copied from the original on Mount Athos.(74) It is also said that \"Baphomet s \" were preserved in the masonic lodges of Hungary, where a debase d form of Masonry, known as Johannite Masonry, survives to this day. If the Templar heresy was th at of the Johannites, the head in question might possibly represent that of John the Baptist, which would accord with the theory that the word Baphomet was derived from Greek words signifying baptism of wisdom. This would, moreover, not be incompatible with Loiseleur's theory of an affinity between the Templars and the Bogomils, for the Bogomils also possessed their own version of the Gospel of St. John, which they placed on the heads of their neophytes during the ceremony of initiation, giving as the reason for the peculiar veneration they professe d for its author that they regarded St. John as the servant of the Jewish God Satanael.(75) Eliphas Lévi even goes so far as to accuse the Templars of following the occult practices of the Luciferians, who carried the doctrines of the Bogomils to th e point of paying homag e to the powers of darkness: Let us declare for the edification of the vul gar . . . and for the greater glory of the Church which has persecuted the Templars, burned the magicians and excommunicated the Free-Masons, etc., let us say boldly and loudly, that all the initiates of the occult sciences . . . have a dored, do and will always adore that which is signified by this frightful symbol [the Sabbatic goat].( 76) Yes, in our profound conviction, the Grand Masters of the Order of the Templars adored Baphomet and caused him to be adored by their initiates.(77) It will be seen, then, that the accusation of heresy brought agains t the Templars does not emanate solely from the Catholic Church, but also from the secret societies. Even our Freemasons, who, for reasons I shall show later, have generally defended the Order, are now willing to admit that there was a very real case against them. Thus Dr. Ranking, who has devoted many years of study to the question, has arrived at the conclusion that Johannism is the real clue to the Templar heresy. In a very interesting paper published in the masonic Journal Ars Qautuor Coronatorum, he observes that \"the record of the Templars in Palestine is one long tale of intr igue and treachery on the part of the Order,\" and finally: That from the very commencement of Christia nity there has been transmitted through the centuries a body of doctrine incompatible with Christianity in the various official Churches. . . That the bodies teaching these doctrines prof essed to do so on the authority of St. John, to whom, as they claimed, the true secrets had been committed by the Founder of Christianity. That during the Middle Ages the main s upport of the Gnostic bodies and the main repository of this knowledge was th e Society of the Templars.(78) 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"What is the explanation of this choice of St. John for the propagation of anti-Christian doctrines which we shall find continuing up to the present day? What else than the method of perversion which in its extreme form becomes Satanism, and consists in always selecting the most sacr ed things for the purpose of desecration? Precisely then because the Gospel of St. John is the one of all the four which most insists on the divinity of Christ, the occult anti-Christian sects have habi tually made it the basis of their rites. 1.

Whilst the Manicheans, the early Ismailis, the Bogomils, and the Luciferians had concerned themselves mainly with religious or esoteric doctrines, the later Is mailis, the Fatimites, the Karmathites, and Templars had combined secrecy and occult ri tes with the political aim of domination. We shall find this double tradition running through all the secret society movement up to the present day. The Dualist doctrines attributed to the Templa rs were not, however, confined to this Order in Europe, but had been, as we have seen, those professed by the Bogomils and also by the Cathari, who spread westwards from Bulgaria and Bosnia to France. It was owing to their sojourn in Bulgaria that th e Cathari gained the popul ar nickname of \" Bulgars \" or \" Bougres,\" signi fying those addicted to unnatu ral vice. One section of the Cathari in the South of France became known after 1180 as the Albigenses, thus called from the town of Albi, although thei r headquarters were really in Toulouse. Christians only in name, they adhered in secret to the Gnostic and Manichean doctrines of the earlier Cathari, which they would appear to have combined with Johannism, since, like this Ea stern sect, they claimed to possess their own Gospel of St. John.(1) Although not strictly a secret society, the Albigenses were divided after the secret society system into initiates and semi-initia tes. The former, few in number, known as the Perfecti, led in appearance an austere life, refraining from meat and professing abhorrence of oaths or of lying. The mystery in which they enveloped themselves won for them the adoring reverence of the Credente s, who formed the great majority of the sect and gave themselves up to every vice, to usury, brigandage, and perjury, and whilst describing marriage as prostituti on, condoning incest and all forms of licence.(2) The Credentes, who were probabl y not fully initiated into the Dualist doctrines of their superiors, looked to them for salvation through the laying-on of hands according to the system of the Manicheans. It was amongst the nobles of Languedoc that the Albigenses found their principal support. This \" Juda of France,\" as it has been called, was peopled by a medley of mixed races, Iberian, Gallic, Roman, and Sem itic.(3) The nobles, very different from the \" ignorant and pious chivalry of the Nort h,\" had lost all respect for their traditions. \" There were few who in going back did not encounter some Saracen or Jewish grandmother in their genealogy.\"(4) Moreover, many had brought back to Europe the laxity of morals they had contracted dur ing the Crusades. The Comte de Comminges practised polygamy, and, according to ecclesiastical chronicles, Raymond VI, Comte de Toulouse, one of the most ardent of the Albigense Credentes, had his harem.(5) The Albigensian movement has been falsely represented as a protest merely against the tyranny of the Church of Rome ; in real ity it was a rising against the fundamental doctrines of Christianity--more than this , against all principles of religion and morality. For whilst some of the sect openl y declared that the Jewish law was preferable to that of the Chri stians,(6) to others the God of the Old Testament was as abhorrent as the \" false Christ \" who suffere d at Golgotha ; the old hatred of the 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Gnostics and Manicheans for the demiurgus liv ed again in these rebels against the social order. Forerunners of the seventeenth century Libertines and eighteenth-century Illuminati, the Albigense nobles, under the pret ext of fighting the priesthood, strove to throw off all the restraints the Church imposed. Inevitably the disorders that took place throughout the South of France led to reprisals, and the Albigenses were suppressed with all the cruelty of the age--a fact which has afforded historians the opportunity to exalt them as noble martyrs, victims of ecclesiastical despotism. But again, as in th e case of the Templars, the fact that they were persecuted does not prove them innocent of the crimes laid to their charge. SATANISM At the beginning of the fourteenth century another development of Dualism, far more horrible than the Manichean heresy of the Albigenses, began to make itself felt. This was the cult of Satanism, or black magic. Th e subject is one that must be approached with extreme caution, owing to the fact that on one hand much that has been written about it is the result of me dival superstition, which sees in every departure from the Roman Catholic Faith the direct intervention of the Evil One, whilst on the other hand the conspiracy of history, which denies in toto the existence of the Occult Power, discredits all revelations on th is question, from whatever source they emanate, as the outcome of hysterical imagination.(7) This is rendered all the easie r since the subject by its amazing extravagance lends itself to ridicule. It is, however, idle to deny that the cult of evil has alway existed ; the invocation of the powers of darkness was practised in the ea rliest days of the human race and, after the Christian era, found its expression, as we have seen, in the Cainites the Euchites, and the Luciferians. These are not surmises, but actual facts of history. Towards the end of the twelfth century Luciferianism sp read eastwards through Styria, the Tyrol, and Bohemia, even as far as Brandenburg ; by the beginning of the thirteenth century it had invaded western Germany, and in the fo urteenth century reached its zenith in that country as also in Ital y and France. The cult had now r eached a further stage in its development, and it was not the mere propitiat ion of Satanael as the prince of this world practised by the Luciferians, but actual Satanism--the love of evil for the sake of evil--which formed the doctrine of the sect known in Italy as la vecchia religione or the \" old religion.\" Sorcery was adopted as a profession, and witches, not, as is popularly supposed, sporadic growths, were tr ained in schools of magic to practise their art. These facts should be remembered when the Church is blamed for the violence it displayed against witchcraft--it was not individuals, but a system which it set out to destroy. The essence of Satanism is desecration. In the ceremonies for infernal evocation described by Eliphas Lévi we r ead : \" It is requisite to pr ofane the ceremonies of the religion one belongs to and to trample its ho liest symbols under foot.\"(8) This practice found a climax in desecrating the Holy Sacrament. The consecrated wafer was given as food to mice, toads, an pigs, or defiled in unspeakable ways. A revolting description of the Black Mass may be f ound in Huysmans's book Lá-bas. It is 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"unnecessary to transcribe the loathsome details here. Suffice it, then, to show that this cult had a very real existence and if any fu rther doubt remains on the matter, the life of Gilles de Rais supplies documentary eviden ce of the visible results of black magic in the Middle Ages. Gilles de Rais was born at Machecoul in Brittany about the year 1404. The first period of his life was glorious ; the companion and guide of Jeanne d'Arc, he became Maréchal of France and dis tinguished himself by many d eeds of valour. But after dissipating his immense fortune, largely on C hurch ceremonies carried out with the wildest extravagance, he was led to study alch emy, partly by curiosity and partly as a means for restoring his shattered fortunes. Hearing that Germany and Italy were the countries where alchemy flourished, he enli sted Italians in his service and was gradually drawn into the further region of magic. According to Huysmans, Gilles de Rais had remained until this moment a Chri stian mystic under the in fluence of Jeanne d'Arc, but after her death--possibly in desp air--he offered himself to the powers of darkness. Evokers of Satan now flocked to him from every side, amongst them Prelati, an Italian, by no means the old and wrinkled sorcerer of tradition, but a young and attractive man of charming manners. For it was from Italy that came the most skilful adepts in the art of alchemy, astr ology, magic, and infernal evocation, who spread themselves over Europe , particularly France. Under the influence of these initiators Gilles de Rais signed a letter to the devil in a meadow near Machecoul asking him for \" knowledge, power, and riches ,\" and offering in exchange anything that might be asked of him with the exception of his life or his soul. But in spite of this appeal and of a pact si gned with the blood of the writ er, no Satanic apparitions were forthcoming. It was then that, becoming still more desper ate, Gilles de Rais had recourse to the abominations for which his name has remained infamous--still more frightful invocations, loathsome debaucheries, perverte d vice in every form, Sadic cruelties, horrible sacrifices, and, finally, holocausts of little boys and girls collected by his agents in the surrounding country and put to death with the most inhuman tortures. During the years 1432-40 literally hundreds of children disappeared. Many of the names of the unhappy little victims were preser ved in the records of the period. Gilles de Rais met with a well deserved end : in 1440 he was hanged and burnt. So far he does not appear to have found a panegyrist to place him in the ranks of noble martyrs. It will, of course, be urged that the crimes here described were those of a criminal lunatic and not to be attributed to any occult cause ; the answ er to this is that Gilles was not a isolated unit, but one of a group of occultists who cannot all have been mad. Moreover, it was only after his invocation of the Evil One that he developed these monstrous proclivities. So also his eighteenth -century replica, the Marquis de Sade, combined with his abominations and impassioned hatred of the Christian religion. What is the explanation of this craze fo r magic in Western Europe ? Deschamps points to the Cabala, \" that science of dem oniacal arts, of which the Jews were the initiators,\" and undoubtedly in any compre hensive review of the question the influence of the Jewish Cabalists cannot be ignored. In Spain, Portugal, Provence, and Italy the Jews by the fifteenth century had b ecome a power ; as early as 1450 they had penetrated into the intellectual circles of Florence, and it was also in Italy that, a century later, the modern Cabalistic school was inaugurated by Isaac Luria (1533-72), whose doctrines were organized into a prac tical system by the Hasidim of Eastern Europe for the writing of amulets, the conj uration of devils, mystical jugglery with 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"numbers and letters, etc.(9) It aly in the fifteenth century was thus a centre from which Cabalistic influences radiated, and it may be that the Italians who indoctrinated Gilles de Rais had drawn their inspiration from this source. Indeed Eliphas Lévi, who certainly cannot be accused of \" Anti-Semitism, \" declares that \" the Jews, the most faithful trustees of the secrets of the Cabala, were almost always the great masters of magic in the Middle Ages,\"(10) and suggests that Gilles de Rais took his monstrous recipes for using the blood of murdered chil dren \" from some of those old Hebrew grimoires (books on magic)) which, if they had been known, would have sufficed to hold up the Jews to the execration of the whole earth.\"(11) Voltaire, in his Henriade, likewise attributes the magical blood-rites practised in the sixteenth century to Jewish inspiration : Dans l'ombre de la nuit, sous une vote obscure, Le silence conduit leur assemblée impure. A la pâle lueur d'un magique flambeau S'élève un vil autel dressé sur un tombeau. C'est la que des deux rois on plaça les images, Objets de leur terreur, ob jets de leurs outrages. Leur sacrilèges mains ont mêlé sur l'autel A des noms infernaux le non de l'Éternel. Sur ces murs ténébreux des lances sont rangées, Dans des vases de sang leur s pointes sont plongées ; Appareil menaçant de leur mystère affreux. Le prêtre de ce temple est un de ces Hébreux Qui, proscrits sur la terr e et citoyens du monde, Portent de mers en mers leur misère profonde, Et, d'un antique ramas de superstitions, Ont rempli dès longtemps toutes les nations, etc. Voltaire adds in a footnote : \" It was ordi narily Jews that were made use of for magical operations. This ancient superstition co mes from the secrets of the Cabala, of which the Jews called themselves the sole depositaries. Catherine de Medicis, the Maréchal d'Ancre, and many others employed Jews for these spells.\" This charge of black magic recurs all through the history of Europe from the earliest times. The Jews are accused of poisoning wells , of practising ritual murder, of using stolen church property for purpos es of desecration, etc. No doubt there enters into all this a great amount of exaggeration, insp ired by popular prejudice and medival superstition. Yet, whilst condemning the persecution to which the Jews were subjected on this account, it must be adm itted that they laid themselves open to suspicion by their real addiction to magi cal arts. If ignorant superstition is found on the side of the persecutors, still more amazi ng superstition is found on the side of the persecuted. Demonology in Europe was in fact essentially a Jewish science, for although a belief in the spirits existed fr om the earliest times and has always continued to exist amongst primitive races, and also amongst the ignorant classes in civilized countries, it was mainly through the Jews that these dark superstitions were imported to the West, where they persisted not merely amongst the lower strata of the Jewish population, but formed an essential pa rt of Jewish tradition. Thus the Talmud says : If the eye could perceive the demons that people the universe, existence would be impossible. The demons are more numerous than we are : they surround us on all 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"sides like trenches dug round vineyards. Ever y one of us has a thousand on his left hand and ten thousand on his right. The di scomfort endured by those who attend rabbinical conferences . . . comes from th e demons mingling with men in these circumstances. Besides, the fatigue one feel s in one's knees in walking comes from the demons that one knocks up against at ev ery step. If the clothing of the Rabbis wears out so quickly, it is again because the demons rub up against them. Whoever wants to convince himself of their presence ha s only to surround his bed with sifted cinders and the next morni ng he will see the imprints of cocks' feet.(12) The same treatise goes on to give directio ns for seeing demon by burning portions of a black cat and placing the ashes in one's eye : \" then at once one perceives the demons.\" The Talmud also explains that dev ils particularly inhabit the water spouts on houses and are fond of drinking out of water- jugs, therefore it is advisable to pour a little water out of a jug before drinking, so as to get rid of the unclean part.(13) These ideas received a fresh impetus from the publication of the Zohar, which, a Jewish writer tells us, \" from the fourteen th century held almost unbroken sway over the minds of the majority of the Jews. In it the Talmudic legends concerning the existence and activity of the shedhim (dem ons) are repeated and amplified, and a hierarchy of demons was established corres ponding to the heavenly hierarchy. . . . Manasseh [ben Israel]'s Nishmat Hayim is full of information concerning belief in demons. . . . Even the scholarly and learned Rabbis of the seventeenth century clung to the belief.\"(14) Here, then, it is not a case of ignorant peas ants evolving fantastic visions from their own scared imaginations, but of the Rabbis, the acknowledged leaders of a race claiming civilized traditions and a high order of intelligence, deliberately inculcating in their disciples the perpetual fear of dem oniacal influences. How much of this fear communicated itself to the Gentil e population ? It is at any rate a curious coincidence to notice the resemblances between so-called popular superstitions and the writings of the Rabbis. For example, the vile confe ssions made both by Scotch and French peasant women accused of witchcraft concerning the nocturnal visits paid hem by male devils(15) find an exact counterpart in passages of the Cabala, where it is said that \" the demons are both male and female, and they also endeavour to consort with human beings--a conception from which arises the belief in incubi and succubo.\"(16) Thus, on Jewish authority, we learn the J udaic origin of this strange delusion. It is clearly to the same source that we ma y trace the magical formul for the healing of diseases current at the same period. From th e earliest times the Jews had specialized in medicine, and many royal personages in sisted on employing Jewi sh doctors,(17) some of whom may have acquired medical knowledge of a high order. The Jewish writer Margoliouth dwells on this fact with some complacency, and goes on to contrast the scientific met hods of the Hebrew doctors with the quackeries of the monks : In spite of the reports circulated by the monks, that the Jews were sorcerers (in consequence of their superior medical sk ill), Christian patients would frequent the houses of the Jewish physicians in preference to the monasteries, where cures were pretended to have been effected by some extr aordinary relics, such as the nails of St. Augustine, the extremity of St. Peter's second toe, . . . etc. It need hardly be added that the cures effected by the Jewish physicians were more numerous than those by the monkish impostors.(18) 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Yet in reality the grotesque remedies whic h Margoliouth attributes to Christian superstition appear to have been part deri ved from Jewish sources. The author of a further article on Magic in Hastings' Ency clopodia goes on to say that the magical formul handed down in Latin in ancient medi cal writings and used by the monks were mainly of Eastern origin, derived from Ba bylonish, Egyptian, and Jewish magic. The monks therefore \" played merely an intermedia te rôle.\"(19) Indeed, if we turn to the Talmud we shall find cures recommended no less absurd than those which Margoliouth derides. For example : The eggs of a grasshopper as a remedy for toothache, the tooth of a fox remedy for sleep, viz. the tooth of a live fox to prevent sleep and of a dead one to cause sleep, the nail from the gallows where a man was hanged, as a remedy for swelling.(20) A strongly \" pro-Semite \" writer quotes a numbe r of Jewish medical writings of the eighteenth century, republished as late as the end of the nineteenth, which show the persistence of these magical formul am ongst the Jews. Most of these are too loathsome to transcribe ; but some of th e more innocuous are as follows : \" For epilepsy kill a cock and let it putrefy.\" \" In order to protect yourse lf from all evils, gird yourself with the rope with which a cr iminal has been hung.\" Blood of different kinds also plays an important part : \" Fox's blood and wolf's blood are good for stone in the bladder, ram's blood for colic, weasel blood for scrofula,\" etc.--these to be externally applied.(21) But to return to Satanism. Whoever were the secret inspirers of ma gical and diabolical practices during the fourteenth to the ei ghteenth centuries, the evidence of the existence of Satanism during this long peri od is overwhelming and rests on the actual facts of history. Details quite as extravagan t and revolting as those contained in the works of Eliphas Lévi(22) or in Huysmans's Là-bas are given in documentary form by Margaret Alice Murray in her singularly pass ionless work relating principally to the witches of Scotland.(23) The cult of evil is a reality--by whatever m eans we may seek to explain it. Eliphas Lévi, whilst denying the existence of Satan \" as a superior persona lity and power,\" admits this fundamental truth : \" Evil exists ; it is impossible to doubt it. We can do good or evil. There are beings who knowingly and voluntarily do evil.\"(24) There are also beings who love evil. Lévi has admirabl y described the spirit that animates such beings in his definition of black magic : Bl ack magic is really but a combination of sacrileges and murders graduated with a view to the permanent perversion of the human will and the realization in a living ma n of the monstrous phantom of the fiend. It is, therefore, properly sp eaking, the religion of the devi l, the worship of darkness, the hatred of goodness exaggerated to the point of paroxysm ; it is the incarnation of death and the permanent creation of hell.(25) The Middle Ages, which depicted the devil fl eeing from holy water, were not perhaps quite so benighted as our superior modern culture has led us to suppose. For that \" hatred of goodness exaggerated to the point of paroxysm,\" that impulse to desecrate and defile which forms the basis of black magic and has manifested itself in successive phases of the world revolution, spri ngs from fear. So by their very hatred the powers of darkness proclaim the existence of the powers of light and their own impotence. In the cry of the demoniac : \" What have we to do with Thee, Jesus of Nazareth ? art Thou come to destroy us ? I know Thee who Thou art, the Holy One of 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"God,\" do we not hear the unwilling tribute of the vanquished to the victor in the mighty conflict between good and evil ? THE ROSICRUCIANS In dealing with the question of Magic it is necessary to r ealize that although to the world in general the word is synonymous with necromancy, it does not bear this significance in the language of occultism, pa rticularly the occultism of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Magic at this date was a term employed to cover many branches of investigation which Robert Fludd, the Englis h Rosicrucian, classified under various headings, of which the first thr ee are as follows : (1) \" Natural Magic, . . . that most occult and secret department of physics by which the mystical properties of natural substances are extracted \"; (2) Mathematical Magic, which enables adepts in the art to \" construct marvellous m achines by means of their geometrical knowledge \" ; whilst (3) Venefic Magic \" is fa miliar with potions, philtres, and with various preparations of poisons.\"(26) It is obvious that all thes e have now passed into the realms of science and are no longer regarded as magical arts ; but the further categories enumerated by Fludd and comprised under the general heading of Necr omantic Magic retain the popular sense of the term. These are described as (1) Go etic, which consists in \" diabolical commerce with unclean spirits, in rites of criminal curiosity, in illicit songs and invocations, and in the evocation of the souls of the dead \" ; (2) Maleficent, which is the adjuration of the devils by the virtue of Divine Names ; and (3) Theurgic, purporting \" to be governed by good angels and the Divine Will, but its wonders are most frequently performed by evil spirits, who assume the names of God and of the angels.\" (4) \" The last species of magic is the Thaumaturgic, begetting illusory phenomena ; by this art the Magi produced th eir phantoms and other marvels.\" To this list might be added Celestial Magic, or know ledge dealing with the influence of the heavenly bodies, on which astrology is based. The forms of magic dealt with in the preceding part of this chapter belong therefore to the second half of these categories, that is to say, to Necromantic Magic. But at the same period another movement was gradua lly taking shape which concerned itself with the first category enumerated above, that is to say the secret properties of natural substances. A man whose methods appear to have appr oached to the modern conception of scientific research was Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, commonly known as Paracelsus, the son of a German doctor , born about 1493, who during his travels in the East is said to have acquired a knowle dge of some secret doctrine which he afterwards elaborated into a system for the healing of diseases. Although his ideas were thus doubtless drawn from some of th e same sources as those from which the Jewish Cabala descended, Paracelsus does not appear to have been a Cabalist, but a scientist of no mean or der, and, as an isolated thinker, apparently connected with no secret association, does not enter furt her into the scope of this work. 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Paracelsus must therefore not be identified with the school of so-called \" Christian Cabalists,\" who, from Raymond Lulli, the \" doctor illuminatus\" of the thirteenth century, onward, drew their inspiration from th e Cabala of the Jews. This is not to say that the influence under which they fell was w holly pernicious, for, just as certain Jews appear to have acquired some real medi cal skill, so also they appear to have possessed some real knowledge of natural scie nce, inherited perhaps from the ancient traditions of the East or derived from the wr itings of Hippocrates, Galen, and other of the great Greek physicians and as yet unknown to Europe. Thus Eliphas Lévi relates that the Rabbi Jechiel, a Cabalistic Jew protected by St Louis, posse ssed the secret of ever-burning lamps,(27) claimed later by the Rosicrucians, which suggests the possibility that some kind of luminous gas or electric light may have been know to the Jews. In alchemy they were the acknowledge d leaders ; the most noted alchemist of the fourteenth century, Nicholas Flamel, discovered the secret of the art from the book of \" Abraham the Jew, Prince, Priest, Levite, Astrologer, an Philosopher,\" and this actual book is said to have pa ssed later into the possession of Cardinal Richelieu.(28) It was likewise from a Florentine Jew, Alemanus or Datylus that Pico della Mirandola, the fifteenth-century mystic, receiv ed instructions in the Cabala(29) and imagined that he had discovered in it the doctrines of Christianity. This delighted Pope Sixtus IV, who thereupon ordered Cabalisti c writings to be translated into Latin for the use of divinity students. At the same time the Cabala was introduced into Germany by Reuchlin, who had learnt Hebrew from the Rabbi Jacob b. Jechiel Loans, court physician to Frederic II I, and in 1494 published a Cabali stic treatise De Verbo Mirifico, showing that all wisdom and true philosophy are derived from the Hebrews. Considerable alarm appears, however, to have been created by the spread of Rabbinical literature, and in 1509 a Jew converted to Christianity, named Pfefferkorn, persuaded the Emperor Maximilian I to burn all Jewish books except the Old Testament. Reuchlin, consulted on this matte r, advised only the destruction of the Toledot Yeshu and of the Sepher Nizzachon by the Rabbi Lipmann, because these works \" were full of blasphemies against Ch rist and against the Christian religion,\" but urged the preservation of the rest. In th is defence of Jewish literature he was supported by the Duke of Bavaria, who appoi nted him professor at Ingoldstadt, but was strongly condemned by the Dominicans of Cologne. In reply to their attacks Reuchlin launched his defence De Arte Cabalistica, glorifying th e Cabala, of which the \" central doctrine for him was the Messianology around which all its other doctrines grouped themselves.\"(30) His whol e philosophical system, as he himself admitted, was in fact entirely Cabalistic, and his views were shared by his contemporary Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim. As a result of these teachings a craze for Cabalism spread amongst Christian prel ates, statesmen, and warriors, and a number of Christian thinkers took up the doctrines of the Cabala and \" essayed to work them over in their own way.\" At hanasius Kircher and Knorr, Baron von Rosenroth, author of the Kabbala Denudata, in the course of the seventeenth century \" endeavoured to spread the Cabala among the Christians by translating Cabalistic works which they regarded as most ancient wisdom.\" \" Most of them,\" the Jewish Encyclopodia goes on to observe derisively, \" held the absurd idea that the Cabala contained proofs of the truth of Christianity. . . . Much that appears Christian [in the Cabala] is, in fact, nothing but the logical development of certain ancient esoteric doctrines.\"(31) The Rosicrucians appear to have been the outcome both of this Cabalistic movement and of the teachings of Paracelsus. The earlie st intimation of their existence was given 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"in a series of pamphlets which appeared at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The first of these, entitled the Fama Fraterni tatis ; or a Discovery of the Fraternity of the most Laudable Order of the Rosy Cross, was published at Cassel in 1614 and the Confessio Fraternitatis early in the follo wing year. These contain what may be described as the \" Grand Legend\" of Rosicr ucianism, which has been repeated with slight variation up to the present day. Brie fly, this story is as follows (32) : \" The most godly and highly-illuminated Father , our brother C.R.,\" that is to say, Christian Rosenkreutz, \" a German, the chief an d original of our Fr aternity,\" was born in 1378, and some sixteen years later travelled to the East with a Brother P.A.L., who had determined to go to the Holy Land. On reaching Cyprus, Brother P.A.L. died and \" so never came to Jerusalem.\" Brother C.R., however, having become acquainted with certain Wise Men of \" Damasco in Arab ia,\" and beheld what great wonders they wrought, went on alone to Damasco. Here the Wise Men received him, and he then set himself to study Physick and Mathematics and to translate the Book M into Latin. After three years he went to Egypt, whence he Journeyed on to Fez, where \" he did get acquaintance with those who are called th e Elementary inhabitants, who revealed to him many of their secrets. . . . Of those of Fez he often did confess that their Magia was not altogether pure and al so that their Cabala was def iled with their religion, but notwithstanding he knew how to make good use of the same.\" After two years Brother C.R. departed the city Fez and sailed away with many costly things into Spain, where he conferred with the learned men and being \" ready bountifully to impart all his arts and secrets\" showed them amongst other th ings how there might be a society in Europe which might have gold, silver, and precious stones sufficient for them to bestow on kings for their necessary uses and lawful purposes. . . .\" Christian Rosenkreutz then returned to Ge rmany, where \" there is nowadays no want of learned men, Magicians, Cabalists, Physicians, and Philosophers.\" Here he \" builded himself a fitting and neat habitation in the which he ruminated his voyage and philosophy and reduced them together in a true memorial.\" At the e nd of five years' meditation there \" came again into his mind the wished-for Reformation : accordingly, he chose \" some few adjoyned with him,\" the Br ethren G.V., I.A., and I.O.--the last of whom \" was very expert and well learned in Cabala as his book H witnesseth \"--to form a circle of initiates. \" After this manne r began the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross.\" Five other Brethren were af terwards added, all Germans except I.A., and these eight constituted his new building called Sancti Sp iritus. The following agreement was then drawn up : · First, that none of them should profess any other thi ng than to cure the sick, and that gratis. · Second, none of the posterity should be constrained to wear one certain kind of habit, but therein to follo w the custom of the country. · Third, that every year, upon the day C., th ey should meet together at the house Sancti Spiritus, or write th e cause of his absence. · Fourth, every Brother should look about for a worthy person who after his decease, might succeed him. · Fifth, the word C.R. should be th eir seal, mark, and character. · Sixth, the Fraternity should rema in secret one hundred years. Finally Brother C.R. died, but where and when, or in what country he was buried, remained a secret. The date, however, is generally given as 1484. In 1604 the 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Brethren who then constituted the inner ci rcle of the Order discovered a door on which was written in large letters Post 120 Annos Patebo. On opening the door a vault was disclosed to view, where beneath a brass tablet the body of Christian Rosenkreutz was found, \" whole and unconsumed,\" with all his \" ornaments and attires,\" and holding in his ha nd the parchment \" I \" which \" next unto the Bible is our greatest treasure,\" whilst beside him lay a number of books, amongst others the Vocabulario of Paracelsus, who, however, the Fama observes, earlier \" was one of our Fraternity.\"(33) The Brethren now knew that after a time th ere would be \" a general reformation both of divine and human things.\" While declari ng their belief in the Christian faith, the Fama goes on to explain that : Our Philosophy is not a new invention, but as Adam after his fall hath received it and as Moses and Solomon used it, . . . wherein Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras, and others did hit the mark and wherein Enoch, Abra ham, Moses, Solomon, did excel, but especially wherewith that wonde rful Book the Bible agreeth. It will be seen that, according to this Mani festo, Rosicrucianism was a combination of the ancient secret tradition handed down from the patriarchs through the philosophers of Greece and of the first Cabala of the Jews. The \" Grand Legend \" of Rosicrucianism re sts, however, on no historical evidence ; there is, in fact, not the least reason to suppose that any such person as Christian Rosenkreutz ever existed. The Illuminatu s von Knigge in the eighteenth century asserted that : It is now recognized amongst enlightened men that no real Rosicrucians have existed, but that the whole of what is contained in the Fama and th e Universal Reformation of the World [another Rosicrucian pamphlet wh ich appeared in the same year] was only subtle allegory of Valentine Andrea, of whic h afterwards partly deceivers (such as the Jesuits) and partly visionaries made us e in order to realize this dream.(34) What, then, was the origin of the name Ro se-Cross ? According to one Rosicrucian tradition, the word \" Rose \" does not deri ve from the flower depicted on the Rosicrucian cross, but from the Latin wo rd ros, signifying \" dew,\" which was supposed to be the most powerful solvent of gold, whilst crux, the cross, was the chemical hieroglyphic for \" light.\" (35) It is said that the Ro sicrucians interpreted the initials of the cross INRI by the sentence \" Igne Nitrum Roris Invenitur.\"(36) Supposing this derivation to be correct, it would be interesting to know whether any connexion could be traced between the first ap pearance of the word Rosie Cross in the Fama Fraternitatis at the date of 1614 and th e cabalistic treatise of the celebrated Rabbi of Prague, Shabbethai Sheftel Horowitz, entitled Shefa Tal, that is to say, \" The Effusion of Dew,\" which appeared in 1612.(37) Although this book has often been reprinted, no copy is to be found in the Brit ish Museum, so I am una ble to pursue this line of enquiry further. A simpler explanat ion may be that the Rosy Cross derived from the Red Cross of the Templars. Mirabeau, who as a Freemason and an Illuminatus was in a position to discover ma ny facts about the secret societies of Germany during his stay in the country, defi nitely asserts that \" the Rose Croix 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Masons of the seventeenth century were only the ancient Order of the Templars secretly perpetuated.\"(38) Lecouteulx de Canteleu is more explicit : In France the Knights (Templar) who left th e Order, henceforth hidden, and so to speak unknown, formed the Order of the Flam ing Star and of the Rose-Croix, which in the fifteenth century spread itself in Bohemia and Silesia. Every Grand officer of these Orders had all his life to wear the Re d Cross and to repeat every day the prayer of St. Bernard.(39) Eckert states that the ritual, symbols, a nd names of the Rose-Croix were borrowed from the Templars, and that the Order was divided into seven degrees, according to the seven days of creation, at the same time signifying that their \" principal aim was that of the mysterious, the i nvestigation of Being and of th e forces of nature.\"(40) The Rosicrucian Kenneth Mackenzie, in his Masonic Cyclopodia, a ppears to suggest the same possibility of Templar origin. Unde r the heading of Rosicrucians he refers enigmatically to an invisible fraternity that has existed from very ancient times, as early as the days of the Crusades, \" bound by solemn obligations of impenetrable secrecy,\" and joining together in work for humanity and to \" glor ify the good.\" \" At various periods of history this body has emerged into a sort of temporary light ; but its true name has never transpired and is only known to the innermost adepts and rulers of the society.\" \" The Rosicrucians of the sixteenth century finally disappeared and re- entered this invisible frater nity \"--from which they had presumably emerged. Whether any such body really existed or whether th e above account is simply an attempt at mystification devised to ex cite curiosity, the incredulous may question The writer here observes that it would be indiscreet to say more, but elsewhere he throws out a hint that may have some bearing on the matte r, for in his article on the Templars he says that after the suppression of the Order it was revived in a more secret form and subsists to the present day. This would exac tly accord with Mirabeau's statement that the Rosicrucian were only the Order of the Templars secretly perpetuated. Moreover, as we shall see later, according to a legend preserved by the Royal Order of Scotland, the degree of the Rosy Cross had been instit uted by that Order in conjunction with the Templars in 1314, and it would certainly be a remarkable coincidence that a man bearing the name of Rosenkreutz should happen to have inaugurated a society, founded, like the Templars, on Eastern secret doc trines during the course of the same century, without any connexion existing between the two. I would suggest, then, that Christian Rosenkreutz was a purely mythical personage, and that the whole legend concerning his tr avels was invented to disguise the real sources whence the Rosicrucians derived thei r system, which would appear to have been a compound of ancient esoteric doctrines of Arabian and Syrian magic, and of Jewish Cabalism, partly inherited from the Templars but reinforced by direct contact with Cabalistic Jews in Germany. The Rose-C roix, says Mirabeau \" were a mystical, Cabalistic, theological, and magical sect,\" and Rosicrucianism thus became in the seventeenth century the generic title by whic h everything of the nature of Cabalism, Theosophy, Alchemy, Astrology, and Mysticism was designated. For this reason it has been said that they cannot be regarded as the descendants of the Templars. Mr. Waite, in referring to \" the alleged connexion between the Templars and the Brethren of the Rosy Cross,\" observes : 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Templars were not alchemists, they had no scientific pretensions, and their secret, so far as it can be ascertained, was a religi ous secret of an anti-Christian kind. The Rosicrucians, on the other hand, were pre-emin ently a learned society and they were also a Christian sect.(41) The fact that the Templars do not appear to have practised alchemy is beside the point ; it is not pretended that the Rosicrucians followed the Templars in every particular, but that they were the inherito rs of a secret tradition passe d on to them by the earlier Order. Moreover, that they were a learned societ y, or even a society at all, is not at all certain fir they would appear to have posse ssed no organization like the Templars or the Freemasons, but to have consisted rather of isolated occul tists bound together by some tie of secret knowledge concerning natural phenomena. This secrecy was no doubt necessary at a period when scientific research was able to be regarded as sorcery, but whether the Rosicrucians real ly accomplished anything is extremely doubtful. They are said to have been alch emists ; but did they ever succeed in transmuting metals ? They are described as learned, yet do the pamphlets emanating from the Fraternity betray any proof of superior knowledge ? \" The Chymical Marriage of Christian Rosenkr eutz,\" which appeared in 1616, certainly appears to be the purest nonsense--magical imaginings th e most puerile kind ; and Mr. Waite himself observes that the publication of the Fama and the Confessio Fraternitatis will not add new lustre to the Rosicrucian reputations : We are accustomed to regard the adepts of the Rosy Cross as beings of sublime elevation and preternatural physical powers, masters of Nature, monarchs of the intellectual world. . . . But here in thei r own acknowledged manifestos they avow themselves a mere theosophical offshoot of the Lutheran heres y, acknowledging the spiritual supremacy of a temporal prince, and calling the Pope anti-C hrist. . . . We find them intemperate in their language, rabid in their religious prejudice s, and instead of towering giant-like above the intellectual av erage of their age, we see them buffeted by the same passions and identified with all opinions of the men by whom they were environed. The voice which addresses us behind the mystical mask of the Rose-Croix does not come from an in tellectual throne. . . . So much for the Rosicrucians as a \" learned society.\" What, then, of their claim to be a Christ ian body ? The Rosicrucian student of the Cabala, Julius Sperber, in his Echo of the Divinely Illuminated Fraternity of the Admirable Order of the R.C. (1615), has indicated the place assigned to Christ by the Rosicrucians. In De Quincey's words : Having maintained the probability of the Rosicrucian pretension on the ground that such magnalia Dei had from the creation downwar ds been confided to the keeping of a few individuals--agreeably to which he affi rms that Adam was the first Rosicrucian of the Old Testament and Simeon the last--he goes on to ask whethe r the Gospel put an end to the secret tradition ? By no mean s, he answers : Christ established a new \" college of magic \" among His disciples and th e greater mysteries were revealed to St. John and St. Paul. John Yarker, quoting this passage, adds : \" This, Brother Findel points out, was a claim of the Carpocratian Gnostics \" ; it was also, as we have se en, a part of the Johannite tradition which is said to have been imparted to the Templars. We shall find the same idea of Christ as an \" initiate \" running all through the secret societies up to the present day. 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"These doctrines not unnaturally brought on the Rosicrucians the suspicion of being an anti-Christian body. The writ of a contemporar y pamphlet published in 1624, declares that \" this fraternity is a stratagem of the Jews and Cabalistic Hebrews, in whose philosophy, says Pic de la Mirando le, all things are . . . as if hidden in the majesty of truth or as . . . in very sacred Mysteries.\"(42) Another work, Examination of the Unknown and Novel Cabala of the Brethren of the Rose-Cross, agrees with the assertion that the chief of this \" execrable college is Satan, that its first rule is denial of G od, blasphemy against the most simple and undivided Trinity, trampling on the mysteries of the redemption, spitting in the face of the mother of God and of all the saints.\" Th e sect is further accu sed of compact with the devil, sacrifices of children, of cherishing toads, making poisonous powders, dancing with fiends, etc. Now, although all this would appear to be quite incompatible with th e character of the Rosicrucians as far as it is known, we have already seen that the practices here described were by no means imaginary ; in th is same seventeenth century, when the fame of the Rosicrucians was first noised abro ad, black magic was still, as in the days of Gilles de Rais, a horrible reality not onl y in France but in England, Scotland, and Germany, where sorcerers of both sexes were continually put to death.(43) However much we may deplore the methods employe d against these people or question the supernatural origin of their cu lt, it would be idle to deny that the cult itself existed. Moreover, towards the end of the century it a ssumed in France a very tangible form in the series of mysterious dr amas known as the \" Affaire des Poisons,\" of which the first act took place in 1666, when the celebra ted Marquis de Brinvillier embarked on her amazing career of crime in collaborati on with her lover Sainte-Croix. This extraordinary women, who for ten years made a hobby of trying the effects of various slow poisons on her nearest relations, there by causing the death of her father and brothers, might appear to have been merely an isolated criminal of the abnormal type but for the sequel to her exploits in the epidemic of poisoning which followed and during twenty years kept Pari s in a state of terror. The investigation of the police finally led to the discovery of a whole ba nd of magicians and alchemists--\" a vast ramification of malefactors covering all France \"--who specialized in the art of poisoning without fear of detection. Concerning all these sorcerer s, alchemists, compounders of magical powders and philtres, frightful rumours circulated, \" pacts with the devil were talked of, sacrifices of new-born babies, incantations, sacril egious Masses and other practices as disquieting as they were lugubrious.\"(44) Even the Ki ng's mistress, Madame de Montespan, is said to have had recourse to black Masses in order to retain the royal favour through the agency of the celebrated sorceress La Voisin, with whom she was later implicated in an accusation of having attempted the life of the King. All the extraordinary details of these events have recently been described in the book of Madame Latour, where the intimate c onnexion between the poisoners and the magicians is shown. In the opinion of cont emporaries, these were not isolated individuals: Their methods were too certain, their executi on of crime too skilful and too easy for them not to have belonged, either directly or indirectly, to a w hole organization of criminals who prepared the way, and studi ed the method of giving to crime the appearance of illness, of forming, in a word, a school.(45) 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The author of the work here quoted draws an interesting parallel between this organization and the modern traffic in co caine, and goes on to describe the three degrees into which it was divi ded : firstly, the Heads, cultivated and intelligent men, who understood chemistry, physics, and nearly all useful sciences, \" invisible counsellors but supreme, without whom the sorcerers would have been powerless \" ; secondly, the visible magicians employing myst erious processes, complicated rites and terrifying ceremonies ; and thirdly, the crowd of nobles and plebeians who flocked to the doors of the sorcerers and f illed their pockets in return for magic potions, philtres, and, in certain cases, insi dious poisons. Thus La Voisin must be placed in the second category ; \" in spite of her luxury, her profits, and her fame,\" she \" is only a subaltern agent in this vast organization of crim inals. She depends entirely for her great enterprises on th e intellectual chiefs of th e corporation. . . .\"(46) Who were these intellectual chiefs ? The man who first initiated Madame de Brinvilliers' lover Sainte-Croix into the ar t of poisoning was an Italian named Exili or Eggidi ; but the real initiate from whom Eggidi and another Italian poisoner had learnt their secrets is said to have been Glaser, variously described as a German or a Swiss chemist, who followed the principles of Paracelsus and occupied the post of physician to the King and the Duc d'Orléans.(47) This man, about whose history little is known, might thus have been a kind of Rosicruc ian. For since, as has been said, the intellectual chiefs from whom the poisoners derived their inspiration were men versed in chemistry, in science, in physics, and the treatment of diseases, and since, further, they included alchemists and people pr ofessing to be in possession of the Philosopher's Stone, their resemblance with th e Rosicrucians is at once apparent. Indeed, in turning back to the branches of magic enumerated by the Rosicrucian Robert Fludd, we find not only Natural Ma gic, \" that most occult and secret department of physics by which the mystical properties of natural substances are extracted,\" but also Venefic Magic, which \" is familiar with potions , philtres, and with various preparations of poisons.\" The art of poisoning was therefore known to the Rosicrucians and, although there is no reason to suppose it was ever practised by the heads of the Fratern ity, it is possible that the inspirers of the poisoners may have been perverted Rosicrucians, that is to say, students of those portions of the Cabala relating to magic both of the necromantic and venefic varieties, who turn ed the scientific knowledge which the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross used for healing to a precisel y opposite and deadly purpose. This would explain the fact that contemporaries like the author of the Examination of the Unknown and Novel Cabala of the Brethren of the Rose-Cross s hould identify these brethren with the magicians and believe them to be guilty of practices deriving from the same sources as Rosicrucian knowledge-- the Cabala of the Jews. Their modern admirers would, of course, declare that th ey were the poles asunder, the difference being between white and black magic. Huysma ns, however, scoffs at this distinction and says the use of the term \" white magic \" was a ruse of the Rose-Croix. But of the real doctrines of the Rosicrucians no one can speak with certainty. The whole story of the Fratern ity is wrapped in mystery. Mystery was avowedly the essence of their system ; their identity, thei r aims, their doctrines, are said to have been kept a profound secret from the world. In deed it is said that no real Rosicrucian ever allowed himself to be known as such. As a result of this systematic method of concealment, sceptics on the one hand have declared the Rosicrucians to have been 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"charlatans and impostors or have denied thei r very existence, whils t on the other hand romancers have exalted them as depositaries of supernatural wisdom. The question is further obscured by the fact that most account s of the Fraternity--as, for example, those of Eliphas Lévi, Hargrave Jennings, Kenneth Mackenzie, Mr. A.E. Waite Dr. Wynn Westcott, and Mr. Cadbury Jones--are the work of men claiming or believing themselves to be initiated into Rosicruciani sm or other occult systems of a kindred nature and as such in posse ssion of peculiar and exclusiv e knowledge. This pretension may at once be dismissed as an absurdity ; nothing is easier than for anyone to make a compound out of Jewish Cabalism and Eastern theosophy and to label it Rosicrucianism, but no proof whatever exists of any affiliation between the self-styled Rosicrucians of to-day and the seventeenth-cen tury \" Brothers of the Rosy Cross.\"(48) In spite of Mr. Waite's claim, \" The Real Hist ory of the Rosicrucians \" still remains to be written, at any rate in the English language. The book he has published under this name is merely a superficial study of the que stion largely composed of reprints of Rosicrucian pamphlets accessible to any student. Mr. Wigston and Mrs. Pott merely echo Mr. Waite. Thus everything that has be en published hitherto consists in the repetition of Rosicrucian lege nds or in unsubstantiated theo rizings on their doctrines. What we need are facts. We want to know who were the early Rosicrucians, when the Fraternity originated, and what were its real aims. These researches must be made, not by an occultist weaving his ow n theories into the subject, but by a historian free from any prejudices for or against the Order, cap able of weighing evidence and of bringing a judicial mind to bear on the material to be found in the librari es of the Continent-- notably the Bibliothque de l'Arsenal in Pa ris. Such a work wold be a valuable contribution to the history of s ecret societies in our country. But if the Continental Brethr en of the Rose-Croix form but a shadowy group of \" Invisibles\" whose identity yet remains a my stery, the English adepts of the Order stand forth in the light of day as philos ophers well known to their age and country. That Francis Bacon was initiated into Rosicrucianism is now recognized by Freemasons, but a more definite link with the Rosicrucians of the Continent was Robert Fludd, who after travelling for six ye ars in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain-- where he formed connexions with Jewish Cabalists(49)--was visited by the German Jew Rosicrucian Michel Maier--doctor to the Emperor Rudolf--by whom he appears to have been initiated into further mysteries. In 1616 Fludd published his Tractatus Apol ogeticus, defending the Rosicrucians against the charges of \" detestable magic a nd diabolical superstiti on \" brought against them by Libavius. Twelve years later Fludd was attacked by Fath er Mersenne, to whom a reply was made \" by Fludd or a fr iend of Fludd's \" containing a further defence of the Order. \" The Book,\" says Mr. Waite, \" treats of the noble art of magic, the foundation and nature of the Cabala, the e ssence of veritable alchemy, and of the Causa Fratrum Rosae Crucis. It identifies the palace or home of the Rosicrucians with the Scriptural House of Wisdom.\" In further works by English writers the Eastern origin of the Fratern ity is insisted on. Thus Thomas Vaughan, known as Eugenius Philalethes, writing in praise of the Rosicrucians in 1652, says that \" their knowledge at first was not purchased by their own disquisitions, for they received it from the Arabians, amongst whom it remained as the monument and legacy of the Children of the East. Nor is this at all improbable, for the Eastern countries have been always famous for magical and secret societies.\" 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Another apologist of the Rosicrucians, J ohn Heydon, who travelled in Egypt, Persia, and Arabia, is described by a contemporary as having been in \" many strange places among the Rosie Crucians and at their castl es, holy hoses, temples, sepulchres, sacrifices.\" Heydon himself, whils t declaring that he is not a Rosicrucian, says that he knows members of the Fraternity and its secrets, that they are sons of Moses, and that \" this Rosie Crucian Physick or Medicine, I happily and unexpectedly alight upon in Arabia.\" These references to castles, temples, sacrifices, encountered in Egypt, Persia, and Arabia inevitably recall memories of both Templars and Ismailis. Is there no connexion between \" the Invisibl e Mountains of the Brethren \" referred to elsewhere by Heydon and the Mountains of the Assassi ns and the Freemasons ? between the Scriptural \" House of Wisdom\" and the Dar-u l-Hikmat or Grand Lodge of Cairo, the model for Western masonic lodges ? It is as the precursors of the crisis that ar ose in 1717 that the English Rosicrucians of the seventeenth century are of supreme im portance. No longer need we concern ourselves with shadowy Brethren laying dubi ous claim to supernatural wisdom, but with a concrete association of professed Initiates proclaiming their existence to the world under the name of Freemasonry. 1. \" Their meetings were held in the most convenient spot, often on mountains or in valleys ; the only essentials were a table, a white cloth, and a copy of the Gospel of St. John, that is, their own version of it.\"--Dr. Ranking, op. cit., p. 15 (A.Q.C., Vol. XXIV.).

Dr. Mackey admits that \" the origin and source whence first sprang the institution of Freemasonry has given rise to more difference of opinion and discussion among masonic schola rs than any other topic in the literature of the institution.\"(2) Nor is this ignorance maintained merely in books for the general public, since in those specially addressed to the Craft and at disc ussions in lodges the same diversity of opinion prevails, and no d ecisive conclusions appear to be reached. Thus Mr. Albert Churchward, a Freemason of the thirtieth degree, who deplores the small amount of interest taken in his matter by Masons in general, observes : Hitherto there have been so many contradict ory opinions and theories in the attempt to supply the origin and th e reason whence, where, and why the Brotherhood of Freemasonry came into existence, and all the \" different parts \" and various rituals of the \" different degrees.\" All that has been wr itten on this has hitherto been theories, without any facts for their foundation.(3) In the absence, therefore, of any origin unive rsally recognized by the Craft, it is surely open to the lay mind to speculate on the matte r and to draw conclusions from history as to which of the many explanations put forward seems to supply the key to the mystery. According to the Royal Masonic Cyclopodia, no less than twelve th eories have been advanced as to the origins of the Or der, namely, that Masonry derived : \" (1) From the patriarchs. (2) From the mysteries of the pagans. (3) From the construction of Solomon's Temple. (4) From the Crusades. (5) From the Knights Templar. (6) From the Roman Collegia of Ar tificers. (7) From the operative masons of the middle ages. (8) From the Rosicrucia ns of the sixteenth century. (9) From Oliver Cromwell. (10) From Prince Charles Stuart for political purposes. (11) From Sir Christopher Wren, at the building of St. Paul's. (12) From Dr. Desaguliers and his friends in 1717.\" This enumeration is, however, misleading, for it implies that in one of these various theories the true origin of Freemasonry may be found. In reality modern Freemasonry is a dual system, a blend of two distinct tradi tions--of operative masonry, that is to say the actual art of building, and of speculative theory on the great truths of life and death. As a well-known Freemason, the Count G oblet d'Alviella, has expressed it : \" Speculative Masonry\" (that is to say, th e dual system we now know as Freemasonry) \" is the legitimate offspring of a fruitful union between the professional guild of medival Masons and of a secret group of philosophical Adepts, the first having furnished the form and the second the spirit.\"( 4) In studying the orig ins of the present system we have therefore (1) to examine se parately the history of each of these two 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"traditions, and (2) to discover their point of junction. OPERATIVE MASONRY Beginning with the first of these two traditions , we find that guilds of working masons existed in very ancient times. Without going back as far as ancient Egypt or Greece, which would be beyond the scope of the present work, the course of these associations may be traced throughout the history of Western Europe from the beginning of the Christian era. According to certain masonic writers, the Druids originally came from Egypt a nd brought with them traditi ons relating to the art of building. The Culdees, who later on established schools and colleges in this country for the teaching of arts, sciences, and handicr afts, are said to have derived from the Druids. But a more probable source of inspiration in the art of building are the Romans, who established the famous Collegia of architects referred to in the list of alternative theories given in the Masonic Cyclopodia. A dvocates of the Roman Collegia origin of Freemasonry may be right as far as operative masonry is concerned, for it is to the period following on the Roman occupation of Br itain that our masonic guilds can with the greatest degree of certai nty be traced. Owing to the im portance the art of building now acquired it is said that many distinguish ed men, such as St. Alban, King Alfred, King Edwin, and King Athelstan were numbere d amongst its partons,(5) so that in time the guilds came to occupy the position of privileged bodies and were known as \" free corporations\"; further that York was th e first masonic centre in England, largely under the control of the Culd ees, who at the same period exercised much influence over the Masonic Collegia in Scotland, at Kilwinning, Melrose, and Aberdeen.(6) But it must be remembered that all this is speculation. No documentary evidence has ever been produced to prove the existence of masonic guilds before the famous York charter of A.D. 926, and even the date of th is document is doubtful. Only with the period of Gothic architecture do we reach firm ground. That guilds of working masons known in France as \" compagnonnage s\" and in Germany as \" Steinmetzen \" did then form close corporations and possi bly possess secrets connected with their profession is more than probable. That in consequence of their skill in building the magnificent cathedrals of this period they now came to occupy a privileged position seems fairly certain. The Abbé Grandidier, writing from Stras bourg in 1778, traces the whole system of Freemasonry from these German guilds : \" This much-vaunted Society of Freemasons is nothing but a servile imitation of an ancient and useful confréri e of real masons whose headquarters was formerly at Stra sbourg and of which the constitution was confirmed by the Emperor Maximilian in 1498.(7) As far as it is possible to discover from the scanty documentary evidence the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixtee nth centuries provide, the sa me privileges appear to have been accorded to the guilds of worki ng masons in England and Scotland, which, although presided over by powerful nobles an apparently on occasion admitting members from outside the Craft, remained essentially operative bodies. Nevertheless 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"we find the assemblies of Masons suppressed by Act of Parliament in the beginning of the reign of Henry VI, and later on an armed force sent by Queen Elizabeth to break up the Annual Grand Lodge at York. It is po ssible that the fraternity merely by the secrecy with which it was surrounded excited the suspicions of authority, for nothing could be more law-abiding than its published statutes. Masons were to be \" true men to God and the Holy Church,\" also to the ma sters that they served. They were to be honest in their manner of life and \" to do no villainy whereby the Craft or the Science may be slandered.\"(8) Yet the seventeenth-century writer Plot, in his Natural History of Staffordshire, expresses some suspicion with regard to th e secrets of Freemasonry. That these could not be merely trade secrets relating to the art of building, but that already some speculative element had been introduced to the lodges, seems the more probable from the fact that by the middle of the seventeenth century not only noble patrons headed the Craft, but ordinary gentlemen entirely unconnected with building were received into the fraternity. The well-known entry in the diary of Elias Ashmole under the date of October 16, 1646, clearly proves this f act : \" I was made a Freemason at Warrington in Lancashire with Col. Henry Ma inwaring of Karticham [?] in Cheshire. The names of those that were then of the Lodge, Mr. Rick. Penket, Warden, Mr. James Collier, Mr. Rich. Sankey, Henry Lit tler, John Ellam Rich. Ellam and Hugh Brewer.\" (9) \" It is now ascer tained,\" says Yarker, \" that the majority of the members present were not operative masons.\"(10) Again, in 1682 Ashmole relates that he at tended a meeting held at Mason Hall in London, where with a number of other gentlemen he was admitted into \" the Fellowship of the Freemasons,\" that is to sa y, into the second degree. We have then clear proof that already in the seventeenth century Freemasonry had ceased to be an association composed exclusively of men concerned with buildi ng, although eminent architects ranked high in the Or der ; Inigo Jones is said to have been Grand Master under James I, and Sir Christopher Wren to have occupied the same position from about 1685 to 1702. But it was not until 1703 that the Lodge of St. Paul in London officially announced \" that the privileges of Masonry should no longer be restricted to operative Masons, but extended to men of va rious professions, pr ovided they were regularly approved and initiat ed into the Order.\"(11) This was followed in 1717 by the great coup d'état when Grand Lodge was founded, and Speculative Masonry, which we now know as Freemasonry, was established on a settled basis with a ritual, rules, and constitu tion drawn up in due form. It is at this important date that the official history of Freemasonry begins. But before pursuing the course of the Order through what is known as the \" Grand Lodge Era,\" it is necessary to go back and enquire into the origins of the philosophy that was now combined with the system of operative masonry. This is the point on which opinions are divided and to which th e various theories summarized in the Masonic Cyclopodia relate. Let us examine each of these in turn. 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"SPECULATIVE MASONRY According to certain sceptics concerning th e mysteries of Freemasonry, the system inaugurated in 1717 had no existence befo re that date, but \" was devised, promulgated, and palmed upon the world by Dr. Desaguliers, Dr. Anderson, and others, who then founded the Grand Lodge of England.\" Mr. Paton, in an admirable little pamphlet(12) has shown the futility of this contention and also the injustice of representing the founders of Grand Lodge as perpetrating so gross a deception. This 1717 theory ascribes to men of the highest character the inventi on of a system of mere imposture. . . . It was brought forward with pretensions whic h its framers knew to be false pretensions of high antiquity ; whereas . . . it had newly been invented in their studies. Is this likely ? Or is it r easonable to ascribe such conduct to honourable men, without even assigning a probable motive for it ? We have indeed only to study masonic ritual--which open to everyone to read--in order to arrive at the same conclusion, that there could be no motive for this imposture and further that these two clergymen cannot be supposed have evolved the whole thing out of their heads. Obviously some move ment of a kindred natu re must have led up to this crisis. And since Elias Ashmole's diary clearly proves that a ceremony of masonic initiation had existed in the preceding century, it is surely only reasonable to conclude that Dr. Anderson and Desaguliers revised but did not originate the ritual and constitutions drawn up by them. Now, although the ritual of Freemasonry is couched in modern and by no means classical English, the ideas running through it certainly bear traces of extreme antiquity. The central idea of Freemasonry c oncerning a loss which has befallen man and the hope of its ultimate recovery is in fact no other than the ancient secret tradition described in the first chapter of this book. Certain masonic writers indeed ascribe to Freemasonry precisely the same genealogy as that of the early Cabala, declaring that it descended from Adam and th e first patriarchs of the human race, and thence through groups of Wise Men amongst th e Egyptians, Chaldeans, Persians, and Greeks.(13) Mr. Albert Church ward insists particularly on the Egyptian origin of the speculative element in Freemasonry : \" Brother Gould and other Freemasons will never understand the meaning and origin of our sacred tenets till they have studied and unlocked the mysteries of the past.\" This study will then reveal the fact that \" the Druids, the Gymnosophists of I ndia, the Magi of Persia, a nd the Chaldeans of Assyria had all the same religious rites and ceremonies as practised by their priests who were initiated to their Order, and that these were solemnly sworn to keep the doctrines a profound secret from the rest of mankind. All these flowed from one source-- Egypt.\"(14) Churchward further quotes the speech of the Rev. Dr. William Dodd at the opening of a masonic temple in 1794, who traced Freemas onry from \" the first astronomers on the plains of Chaldea, the wise and mystic kings and priests of Egypt, the sages of Greece and philosophers of Rome,\" etc.(15) But how did these traditions des cend to the masons of the West ? According to a large body of masonic opinion in this country which recognizes only a single source of inspiration to the system we now know as Freemasonry, the speculative as well as the 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"operative traditions of the Order desce nded from the building guilds and were imported to England by means of the Roma n Collegia. Mr. Churchward, however, strongly dissents from this view : In the new and revised edition of the Perfect Ceremonies according to our E. working, a theory is given that Freemasonry originat ed from certain guilds of workmen which are well known in history as the \" Roman College of Artificers.\" There is no foundation of fact for such a theory. Freemasonry is now, and always was, an Eschatology, as may be proved by the whole of our signs, symbols, and words, and our rituals.(16) But what Mr. Churchward fails to explai n is how this eschatology reached the working masons, moreover why, if, as he a sserts, it derived from Egypt, Assyria, India, and Persia, Freemasonry no longer bear s the stamp of these countries. For although vestiges of Sabeism may be found in the decoration of the lodges, and brief references to the mysteries of Egypt and Phoenicia, to the secret teaching of Pythagoras, to Euclid, and to Plato in the R itual and instructions of the Craft degrees-- nevertheless the form in which the ancient tradition is clothed, the phraseology and pass-words employed, are neither Egyptian, Chal dean, Greek, nor Persian, but Judaic. Thus although some portion of the ancient secret tradition may have penetrated to Great Britain through the Druids or the Romans--versed in the lore of Greece and Egypt--another channel for its introduction was clearly th e Cabala of the Jews. Certain masonic writers recognize this double tradition, the one descending from Egypt, Chaldea, and Greece, the other from the Is raelites, and assert that it is from the latter source their system is derived.(17) Fo r after tracing its origin from Adam, Noah, Enoch, and Abraham, they proceed to show its line of descent through Moses, David, and Solomon (18) --descent from Solomon is in fact officially r ecognized by the Craft and forms a part of the instructions to candi dates for initiation into the first degree. But, as we have already seen, this is the precise genealogy attributed to the Cabala by the Jews. Moreover, modern Freemasonry is entirely built up on the Solomonic, or rather the Hiramic legend. For the sake of readers unfamiliar with the ritual of Freemasonry a brief résumé of this \" Grand Legend\" must be given here. Solomon, when building the Temple, employed th e services of a certa in artificer in brass, named Hiram, the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphthali, who was sent to him by Hiram, King of Tyre. So much we know from the Book of Kings, but the masonic legend goes on to relate that Hiram the widow's son, referred to as Hiram Abiff, and described as the master-builder met with an untimely end. For the purpose of preserving order the masons working on the Temple were divided into three classes, Entered Apprentices, Fellow Crafts, and Master Masons, the first two distinguished by different pass-words and grips and paid at different rates of wages, the last consisting only of three persons --Solomon himself, Hiram King of Tyre, who had provided him with wood and precious stone s and Hiram Abiff. Now, before the completion of the Temple fifteen of the Fell ow Crafts conspired t ogether to find out the secrets of the Master Masons and resolved to waylay Hiram Ab iff at the door of the Temple. At the last moment twelve of the fifteen drew back, but the remaining three carried out the fell design, and after threatening Hiram in vain in order to obtain the secrets, killed him with three blows on the head, delivered by each in turn. They then conveyed the body away to some distance from Jerusalem and buried it on Mount 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Moriah. Solomon, informed of the disappear ance of the master-builder, sent out fifteen Fellow Crafts to seek for him ; five of these, having arri ved at the mountain, noticed a place where the earth had been disturbed and there discovered the body of Hiram. Leaving a branch of acacia to mark the spot, they returned with their story to Solomon, who ordered them to go and exhume the body--an order that was immediately carried out. The murder and exhumation, or \" raising,\" of Hiram, accompanied by extraordinary lamentations, form the climax of Craft Mas onry ; and when it is remembered that in all probability no such tragedy ever took place, that possibly no one known as Hiram Abiff ever existed,(19) the whole story can only be regarded as the survival of some ancient cult relating not to an actual event, but to an esoteric do ctrine. A legend and a ceremony of this kind is indeed to be found in many earlier mythologies ; the story of the murder of Hiram had been foreshadowed by the Egyptian legend of the murder of Osiris and the quest for his body by Isis, wh ilst the lamentations around the tomb of Hiram had a counterpart in the mourning cer emonies for Osiris and Adonis--both, like Hiram, subsequently \" raised \"--and late r on in that which took place around the catafalque of Manes, who, like Hiram, was ba rbarously put to death and is said to have been known to the Manicheans as \" the son of the widow.\" But in the form given to it by Freemasonry the legend is purely Juda ic, and would therefore appear to have derived from the Judaic version of the anci ent tradition. The pill ars of the Temple, Jachin and Boaz, which play so important a part in Craft Masonry, are symbols which occur in the Jewish Cabala, where they are de scribed as two of the ten Sephiroths.(20) A writer of the eighteenth century, referring to \" fyve curiosities \" he has discovered in Scotland, describes one as-- The Mason word , which tho' some make a Misterie of it, I will not conceal a little of what I know. It is lyke a Rabbinical Tradition in way of Comment on Jachin and Boaz, the Two Pillars erected in Solomon's Temple with ane Addition delyvered from Hand to Hand, by which they know and become familiar one with another. This is precisely the system by which the Cabala was handed down amongst the Jews. The Jewish Encyclopodia lends colour to th e theory of Cabalistic transmission by suggesting that the story of Hiram \" may po ssibly trace back to the Rabbinic legend concerning the Temple of Solomon,\" that \" wh ile all the workmen were killed so that they should not build another temple devoted to idolatry, Hiram hims elf was raised to Heaven like Enoch.\"(21) How did this Rabbinic legend find its way into Freemasonry ? Advocates of the Roman Collegia theory explain it in the following manner. After the building of the Temp le of Solomon the masons wh o had been engaged in the work were dispersed and a number made thei r way to Europe, some to Marseilles, some perhaps to Rome, where they may have introduced Judaic legends to the Collegia, which then passed on to the Com acini Masters of the seventh century and from these to the medival working guilds of England, France, and Germany. It is said that during the Middle Ages a story concer ning the Temple of Solomon was current amongst the compagnonnages of France. In one of these groups, known as \" the children of Solomon,\" the legend of Hiram appears to have existed much in its present form ; according to another group the victim of the murder was not Hiram Abiff, but one of his companions named Maître Jacque s, who, whilst engaged with Hiram on the construction of the Temple, met his death at the hands of five wicked Fellow Crafts, 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"instigated by a sixth, the Pre Soubise.(22) But the date at which this legend originat ed is unknown. Clavel thinks that the \" Hebraic mysteries existed as early as the Roman Collegia, which he describes as largely Judaised (23) ; Yarker expresses pr ecisely the opposite view : \" It is not so difficult to connect Freemasonry with the Colle gia ; the difficulty lies in attributing Jewish traditions to the Collegia, and we say on the evidence of the oldest charges that such traditions had no existen ce in Saxon times.\" (24) Again : \" So far as this country is concerned, we know nothing from documen ts of a Masonry dating from Solomon's Temple until after the Crusades, when the constitution believed to have been sanctioned by King Athelstan gradually underw ent a change.\" (25) In a discussion which took place recently at the Quatuor Co ronati Lodge the Hiramic legend could only be traced back--and then without absolu te certainty--to the fourteenth century, which would coincide with the date indicated by Yarker.(26) Up to this period the lore of the masonic guilds appears to have contained only the exoteric doctrines of Egypt and Greece--w hich may have reached them through the Roman Collegia, whilst the traditions of Ma sonry are traced from Adam, Jabal, Tubal Cain, from Nimrod and the Tower of Babel, with Hermes and Pythagoras as their more immediate progenitors.(27) These doc trines were evidently in the main geometrical or technical, and in no sens e Cabalistic. There is therefore some justification for Eckert's stat ement that \" the Judeo-Christ ian mysteries were not yet introduced into the masonic corporations ; nowhere can we find the least trace of them. Nowhere do we find any classification, not even that of masters, fellow crafts, and apprentices. We observe no symbol of the Temple of Solomon ; all their symbolism relates to masonic labours and to a few philosophical maxims of morality.\" (28) The date at which Eckert, like Yarker, places the introduction of these Judaic elements is the time of the Crusades. But whilst recognizing that modern Craft Ma sonry is largely founded on the Cabala, it is necessary to distinguish between the differe nt Cabalas. For by this date no less than three Cabalas appear to have existed : fi rstly, the ancient secr et tradition of the patriarchs handed down from the Egyptians through the Greeks and Romans, and possibly through the Roman Collegia to the Cr aft Masons of Britain ; secondly, the Jewish version of this trad ition, the first Cabal of the Je ws, in no way incompatible with Christianity, descending from Moses, David, and Solomon to the Essenes and the more enlightened Jews ; and thirdly, the perverted Cabala, mi ngled by the Rabbis with magic, barbaric superstitions, and--after the death of Christ-- with anti-Christian legends. Whatever Cabalistic elements were introduced into Craft Masonry at the time of the Crusades appear to have belonged to the second of these traditions, the unperverted Cabala of the Jews, known to the Essenes. Th ere are, in fact, st riking resemblances between Freemasonry and Essenism--degrees of initiation, oaths of secrecy, the wearing of the apron, and certain masonic sign ; whilst to the Sabeist traditions of the Essenes may perhaps be traced the solar and stellar symbolism of the lodges.(29) The Hiramic legend may have belonged to the same tradition. 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLAR TRADITION If then no documentary evidence can be br ought forward to show that either the Solomonic legend or any traces of Judaic sy mbolism and traditions existed either in the monuments of the period or in the ritual of the mas ons before the fourteenth century, it is surely reasonable to recogni ze the plausibility of the contention put forward by a great number of masonic writers-- particularly on the Continent--that the Judaic elements penetrated into Mas onry by means of the Templars.(30) The Templars, as we have already seen, had taken their name from the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. What then more likel y than that during the time they had lived there they had learnt the Rabbinical legends connected with the Temple ? According to George Sand, who was deeply versed in th e history of secret societies, the Hiramic legend was adopted by the Templars as symbolic of the destruction of their Order. \" They wept over their impotence in the person of Hiram. The word lost and recovered is their empire. . . .\"(31) The Freemason Ra gon likewise declares that the catastrophe they lamented was the catastrophe that dest royed their Order.(32) Further, the Grand Master whose fate they deplored was J acques du Molay. Here then we have two bodies in France at the same period, the Templar and the compagnonnages, both possessing a legend concerning the Temple of Solomon and both mourning a Maître Jacques who had been barbarously put to de ath. If we accept the possibility that the Hiramic legend existed amongst the masons before the Crusades, how are we to explain this extraordinary coinci dence ? It is certai nly easier to believe that the Judaic traditions were introduced to the masons by the Templars and grafted on to the ancient lore that the masonic guilds ha d inherited from the Roman Collegia. That some connexion existed between the Templars and the working masons is indicated by the new influence that entere d into building at this period. A modern Freemason comparing \" the beautifully desi gned and deep-cut marks of the true Gothic period, say circa 1150-1350,\" with \" th e careless and roughly executed marks, many of them mere scratches, of later periods,\" points out that \" the Knights Templars rose and fell with that wonderful developmen t of architecture.\" The same writer goes on to show that some of the most important masonic symbols, the equilateral triangle and the Mason's square surmounting two pillars, came through from Gothic times.(33) Yarker asserts that the level, the flaming star, and the Tau cross, which have since passed into the symbolism of Freemasonry may be traced to the Knights Templar, as also the five-pointed star in Salisbury Cathedral, the double triangle in Westminster Abbey, Jachin and Boaz, the circle and the pentagon in the masonry of the fourteen century. Yarker cites later, in 1556, the eye and crescent moon, the three stars and the ladder of five steps, as further evidences of Templar influence.(34) \" The Templars were large builders, and Jacques du Molay alle ged the zeal of his Order in decorating churches in the process against him in 1310 ; hence the alle ged connexion of Templary and Freemasonry is bund to have a substratum of truth.\"(35) Moreover, according to a mas onic tradition, an alliance definitely took place between the Templars and the masonic guilds at this period. During the proceedings taken against the Order of the Temple in France it is said that Pierre d'Aumont and seven other Knights escaped to Scotland in the guise of working masons and landed in the Island of Mull. On St. John's Day, 1307, they held their first chap ter. Robert Bruce 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"then took them under his protection, and seven years later they fought under his standard at Bannockburn against Edward II, who had suppressed their Order in England. After this battle, which took place on St. John the Baptist's Day in summer (June 24), Robert Bruce is said to have instituted the Royal Order of H.R.M. (Heredom) and Knights of R.S.Y.C.S. (R osy Cross).(36) These two degrees now constitute the Royal Order of Scotland, and it seems not improbable that in reality they were brought to Scotland by the Templa rs. Thus, according to one of the early writers on Freemasonry, the degree of the Rose-C roix originated with the Templars in Palestine as early as 1188 (37) ; whilst th e Eastern origin of the word Heredom, supposed to derive from a mythical mount on an island south of the Hebrides(38) where the Culdees practised their rites, is indicated by another eighteenth-century writer, who traces it to a Jewi sh source.(39) In this same year of 1314 Robert Bruce is said to have united the Templars and the Royal Order of H.R.M. with the guilds of working masons, who had also fought in his army, at the famous Lodge of Kilwinning, founded in 1286,(40) which now adde d to its name that of Heredom and became the chief seat of the Order.(41) Scotland was essentially a home of operative masonry and, in view of the Templar's prowess in the art of building, what more natural than that the two bodies should enter into an allian ce ? Already in England the Temple is said between 1155 and 1199 to have ad ministered the Craft.(4 2) It is thus at Heredom of Kilwinning, \" the Holy House of Masonry \"--\" Mother Kilwinning,\" as it is still known to Freemasons--that a specula tive element of a fresh kind may have found its way into the lodges. Is it not here, then, that we may see that \" fruitful union between the professional guild of medival masons and a secret group of philosophical Adepts \" alluded to by Count Goblet d'Aviella and described by Mr. Waite in the following words : The mystery of the building guilds--whatever it may be held to have been--was that of a simple, unpolished, pious, and utilitarian device ; and this daughter of Nature, in the absence of all intention on her own part, unde rwent, or was coerced into one of the strangest marriages which has been celebrated in occult history. It so happened that her particular form and figure lent itself to such a union, etc.(43) ? Mr. Waite with his usual vagueness does not explain when and where this marriage took place, but the account would certai nly apply to the alliance between the Templars and Scottish guilds of working masons, which, as we have seen, is admitted by masonic authorities, and presents exactly the conditions described, the Templars being peculiarly fitted by their initiation in to the legend concerning the building of the Temple of Solomon to co-operate with the masons, and the masons being prepared by their partial initiation into ancient mysterie s to receive the fresh influx of Eastern tradition from the Templars. A further indication of the Templar influen ce in Craft Masonry is the system of degrees and initiations. The names of Entere d Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason are said to have deri ved from Scotland,(44) and th e analogy between these and the degrees of the Assassins has alrea dy been shown. Indeed, the resemblance between the outer organization of Freemasonry and the system of the Ismailis is shown by many writers. Thus Dr. Bussell observ es : \" No doubt together with some knowledge of geometry regarded as an esot eric trade secret, ma ny symbols to-day current did pass down from very primitive times. But a more certain model was the Grand Lodge of the Ismailis in Cairo\"--that is to say the Dar-ul-Hikmat.(45) Syed Ameer Ali also expresses the opinion that \" Makrisi's account of the different degrees 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"of initiation adopted in this lodge forms an invaluable record of Freemasonry. In fact, the lodge at Cairo became the model of all the Lodges created afterwards in Christendom.\"(46) Mr. Bernard Springett, a Freemason, quoting this passage, adds : \" In this last assertion I am myse lf greatly in agreement.\"(47) It is surely therefore legitimate to surmise that this system penetrated to Craft Masonry through the Templars, whose connexion with the Assassins--offshoot of the Dar-ul-Hikmat--was a matter of common knowledge. The question of the Templar succession in Freemasonry form perhaps the most controversial point in the whol e history of the Order, British Freemasons in the main rejecting it in favour of the Roman Colle gia theory, Continental Masons more generally accepting it, and ev en glorying in it.(48) Mackey, in his Lexicon of Freemasonry, thus sums up the matter : The connexion between the Knights Templar a nd the Freemasons has been repeatedly asserted by the enemies of both institution and has often been admitted by their friends. Lawrie, on the subject, holds the fo llowing language : \" We know that the Knights Templar not only possessed the my steries but performed the ceremonies and inculcated the duties of Freemasons,\" and he attributes the dissoluti on of the Order to the discovery of their being Freemasons and th eir assembling in secr et to practise the rites of the Order.(49) This explains why Freemasons have alwa ys shown indulgence to the Templars. It was above all Freemasonry [says Findel], whic h--because it falsely held itself to be a daughter of Templarism--took the greatest pains to represent the Order of the Templars as innocent and therefore free from all mystery. For this purpose not only legends and unhistorical f acts were brought forward, but manouvres were also resorted to in order to suppr ess the truth. The masonic reverers of the Temple Order bought up the whole edition of the Actes du Pr ocès of Moldenhawer, because this showed the guilt of the Order ; only a few c opies reached the booksellers. . . . Already several decades before . . . the Freemasons in their unhistorical effo rts had been guilty of real forgery. Dupuy had published his History of the Trial of the Templars as early as 1654 in Paris, for which he had made use of the original of the Actes du Procès, according to which the guilt of the Order leaves no room for doubt. . . . But when in the middle of the eighteenth century several br anches of Freemasonry wished to recall the Templar Order into being, the work of Dupuy was naturally very displeasing. It had already been current amongst the public for a hundred years, so it could no longer be bought ; therefore they falsified it.(50) Accordingly in 1751 a reprint of Dupuy's wo rk appeared with the addition of a number of notes and remarks and mutilated in such a way as to prove not the guilt but the innocence of the Templars. Now, although British Masonry has played no part in these intrigues, the question of the Templar succession has been very inadequa tely dealt with by the masonic writers of our country. As a rule they have adopted one of two courses --either they have persistently denied connexion with the Templars or they have represented them as a blameless and cruelly maligned Order. But in reality neither of these expedients is necessary to save the honour of British Masonry, for not ev en the bitterest enemy of Masonry has ever suggested that British ma sons have adopted any portion of the Templar heresy. The Knights who fled to Scotland may have been perfectly innocent 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"of the charges brought against their Order ; in deed, there is good reason to believe this was the case. Thus the Manuel des Chevaliers de l'Ordre du Temple relates the incident in the following manner : After the death of Jacques du Molay, some Scottish Templars having become apostates, at the instigation of Robert Br uce ranged themselves under the banners of a new Order (51) instituted by this prince and in which the receptions were based on those of the Order of the Temple. It is here that we must seek the origin of Scottish Masonry and even that of the other mas onic rites. The Scottish Templars were excommunicated in 1324 by Larmenius, who de clared them to be Templi desertores and the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, Do mniorum Militio spoliatores, placed for ever outside the pale of the Temple : Extr a girum Templi, nunc et in futurum, volo, dico et jubeo. A similar anathema has sin ce been launched by seve ral Grand Masters against Templars who were rebellious to le gitimate authority. From the schism that was introduced into Scotland a num ber of sects t ook birth.(52) This account forms a complete exoneration of the Scottish Templars ; as apostates from the bogus Christian Church and the doctrines of Johannism they showed themselves loyal to the true Church and to the Christian faith as formulated in the published statutes of their Order. What th ey appear, then to have introduced to Masonry were their manner of reception, that is to say their outer forms and organization, and possibly certain Eastern esoteric doctrines and Judaic legends concerning the building of the Temple of So lomon in no way incompatible with the teaching of Christianity. It will be noticed, moreover, that in th e ban passed by the Ordre du Temple on the Scottish Templars the Knights of St John of Jerusalem are also included. This is a further tribute to the orthodoxy of the Scottish Knights. For to the Knight of St. John of Jerusalem--to whom the Templar property was given--no suspicion of heresy had ever attached. After the suppression of the Order of the Temple in 1312 a number of the Knights joined themselves to the Knight s of St. John of Jerusalem, by whom the Templar system appears to have been purged of its heretical elements . As we shall see later, the same process is said to have been carried out by the Royal Order of Scotland. All this suggests that the Templars had imported a secret doctrine from the East which was capable either of a Christian or an anti-Christian interpretation, that through their connexion with th e Royal Order of Scotland and the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem this Christian interpretation wa s preserved, and finally that it was this pure doctrine which passed into Freemasonry. According to early masonic authorities, the adoption of the two St. Johns as the pa tron saints of Masonry arose, not from Johannism, but from the alliance between the Templars and the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem.(53) It is important to remember that the theory of the Templar connexion with Freemasonry was held by the Continental Fr eemasons of the eighteenth century, who, living at the time the Order was reconstituted on its present basis, were clearly in a better position to know its orig ins than we who are separa ted from that date by a distance of two hundred years. But since thei r testimony first comes to light at the period of the upper degrees, in which the Te mplar influence is more clearly visible than in Craft Masonry, it must be reserved for a later chapter. Before passing on to this further stage in the history of the Craft, it is necessary to consider one more link in the chain of the masonic tr adition--the \" Holy Vehm.\" 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE VEHMGERICHTS (54) These dread tribunals, said to have been established by Charlemagne in 772(55) in Westphalia, their avowed object the estab lishment of law and order amidst the unsettled and even anarchic conditions that reigned in Germany. But by degrees the power arrogated to itself by the \" Holy Vehm \" became so formidable that succeeding emperors were unable to control its workings and found themselves forced to become initiates from motives of self -protection. During the twelft h century Vehmgerichts, by their continual executions, had created a verita ble \" Red Terror \" so that the East of Germany was known as the Red Land. In 1371, sa ys Lecouteulx de Canteleu, a fresh impetus was given to the \" Holy Vehm \" by a number of the Knights Templar who, on the dissolution of their Order had found their way to Germany and now sought admission to the Secret Tribunals.(56) How much of Templar lore passed into the hand of the Vehmgerichts it is impossibl e to know, but there is certainly a resemblance between the methods of in itiation and intimidation employed by the Vehms and those described by certain of the Templars, still more between the ceremony of the Vehms and the ritual of Freemasonry. Thus the members of the Vehms, known as the Wissende (or Enlightened), were divided into three degrees of initiation : the Free Judges, the veritable Free Judges, and the Holy Judges of the Secret Tribuna l. The candidate for initiation was led blindfold before the dread Tribunal, presided over by a Stuhlherr (or master of the chair) or his substitute, a Freigraf, with a sword and branch of willow at his side. The initiate was then bound by a terrible oath not to reveal the secr ets of the \" Holy Vehm,\" to warn no one of danger threat ening them by its decrees, to denounce anyone, whether father, mother brother, sist er, friend, or relation, if such a one had been condemned by the Tribunal. After this he was given the pa ssword and grip by which the confederates recognized each other. In the event of his turning traitor or revealing the secrets confided to him his eyes were bandaged, his hands tied behind his back and his tongue was torn out through th e back of his neck after which he was hanged by the feet till he was dead, with the solemn imprecation that his body should be given as a prey to the birds of the air. It is difficult to believe that the points of resemblance with modern masonic ritual (57) which may here be discerned can be mere matter of coincidence, yet it would be equally unreasonable to trace th e origins of Freemasonry to the Vehmgerichts. Clearly both derived from a common source either th e old pagan traditions on which the early Vehms were founded or the system of th e Templars. The latter seems the more probable for two reasons : firstly, on account of the resemblance between the methods of the Vehmgerichts and the Assassins, which would be e xplained if the Templars formed the connecting link ; and secondly, th e fact that in contemporary documents the members of the Secret Tribunals were frequently referred to under the name of Rose-Croix.(58) Now, since, as we have seen, the degree of the Rosy Cross is said to have been brought to Europe by the Templars, this would account for the persistence of the name in the Vehmgerichts as well as in the Rosicrucians of the seventeenth century, who are said to have continued the Templar tradition. Thus Templarism and Rosicrucianism appear to have been always closely connected, a fact which is not surprising since both derive from a common s ource--the traditions of the near East. This brings us to an altern ative theory concerning the channel through which Eastern doctrines, and particularly Cabalism, found their way into Freemasonry. For it must 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"be admitted that one obstacle to the complete acceptance of the theory of the Templar succession exists, namely, that although the J udaic element cannot be traced further back than the Crusades, neither can it with certainty be pronounced to have come into existence during the three centuries that follo wed after. Indeed, before the publication of Anderson's \" Constitutions \" in 1723 ther e is no definite evidence that the Solomonic legend had been incorporated in to the ritual of British Masonry. So although the possession of the legend by the conpagnonnages of the Middle Ages would tend to prove its antiquity, there is always the possibility that it was introduced by some later body of adepts than the Templars. According to the partisans of a further theory, these adepts were the Rosicrucians. ROSICRUCIAN ORIGIN One of the earliest and most eminent precursor s of Freemasonry is said to have been Francis Bacon. As we have already seen, Bacon is recognized to have been a Rosicrucian and that the secret philosophical doctrine he prof esses was closely akin to Freemasonry is clearly apparent in his New A tlantis. The reference, to the, \" Wise Men of the Society of Solomon's House \" ca nnot be a mere coincidence. The choice of Atlantis--the legendary island supposed to have been submerged by the Atlantic Ocean in the remote past--would suggest that Bacon had some knowledge of a secret tradition descending from the earliest patria rchs of the human race, whom, like the modern writer Le Plongeon, he imagined to have inhabited the Western hemisphere and to have been the predecessors of th e Egyptian initiates. Le Plongeon, however, places this early seat of the mysteries still fu rther West than the A tlantic Ocean, in the region of Mayax and Yucatan.(59) Bacon further relates that this tradition was preserved in its pure form by certain of the Jews, who whilst accepting the Cabala reject ed its anti-Christian tendencies. Thus in this island of Bensalem there are Jews \" of a far differing disposition from the Jews in other parts. For whereas they hate the name of Christ, and have a secret inbred rancour against the people amongst whom they live ; these contrariwise give unto our Savour many high attributes,\" but at the sa me time they believe \" that Moses by a secret Cabala ordained the laws of Bensalem which they now use, and that when the Messiah should come and sit on his throne at Jerusalem, the King of Bensalem should sit at His feet, whereas other kings should keep at a great distance.\" This passage is of particular interest as showing that Bac on recognized the divergence between the ancient secret tradition descending from Mose s and the perverted Jewish Cabala of the Rabbis, and that he was perfectly awar e of the tendency even among the best of Jews to turn the former to the a dvantage of their Messianic dreams. Mrs. Pott, who in her Francis Bacon and his Secret Society sets out to prove that Bacon was the founder of Rosicrucianism a nd Freemasonry, ignores all the previous history of the secret traditi on. Bacon was not the originator but the inheritor of the ideas on which both these societies were founded. And the further contention that Bacon was at the same time the author of th e greatest dramas in the English language and of The Chymical Marriage of Christia n Rosenkreutz is manifestly absurd. Nevertheless, Bacon's influence amongst th e Rosicrucians is apparent ; Heydon's 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Voyage to the Land of the Rosicrucians is in fact a mere plagiarism of Bacon's New Atlantis. Mrs. Pott seems to imagine that by proclaim ing Bacon to have been the founder or even a member of the Order of Freemasonry she is revealing a great masonic secret which Freemasons have conspired to keep dark. But why should the Craft desire to disown so illustrious a progenitor or seek to conceal his connexion with the Order if any such existed ? Findel, indeed, frankly admits that the New Atlantis contained unmistakable allusions to Freemasonry a nd that Bacon contribut ed to its final transformation.(60) This was doubtless br ought about largely by the English Rosicrucians who followed after. To suggest then that Freemasonry originated with the Rosicrucians is to ignore the previous history of the secret tradition. Rosicrucianism was not the beginning but a link in the long chain connecting Freemasonry with far earlier secret associ ations. The resemblance between the two Orders admits of no denial. Thus Yarker writes : \" The symbolic tracing of the Rosicrucians was a Square Temple approached by seven steps . . . here also we find the two pillars of Hermes, the five-pointed star, sun and moon, compasses, square and triangle.\" Yarker further observes that \" ev en Wren was more or less a student of Hermeticism, and if we had a full list of Freemasons and Rosicrucians we should probably be surprised at the number who belonged to both systems.\"(61) Professor Bühle emphatically states that \" Freemasonry is neither more nor less than Rosicrucianism as modified by those who transplanted it into England.\" Chambers, who publish his famous Cyclopodia in 1728, obs erves : \" Some who are friends to Freemasonry, make the present flourishing society of Freemasons a branch of Rosicrucians, or rather the Rosicrucians themselves under a new name or relation, viz. as retainers to building. And it is certain there are some Freemasons who have all the characters of Rosicrucians.\" The connexion between Freemasonry and Rosi crucianism is, however, a question hardly less controversial than that of the connexion between Freemasonry and Templarism. Dr. Mackey violently disputes the theory. \" The Rosicrucians ,\" he writes, \" as this brief history indicates, ha d no connexion whatever with the masonic fraternity. Notwithstanding this fact, Barruel, the most malignant of our revilers with a characteristic spirit of misrepresent ation, attempted to identify the two institutions.\"(62) But the aforesaid \" brief history \" indicates nothing of the kind, and the reference to Barruel as a malignant reviler for sugges ting a connexion, which, as we have seen, many Freemasons admit, shows on which side this \" spirit of misrepresentation \" exists. It is interesting, however, to note that in the eyes of certain masonic writers connexion with the Rosicrucians is regarded as highly discreditabl e ; the fraternity would thus appear to have been less blamel ess than we have been taught to believe. Mr. Waite is equally concerned with provi ng that there \" is no traceable connexion between Masonry and Rosicrucianism,\" and he goes on to explain that Freemasonry was never a learned society, that it never laid claim to \" any transcendental secrets of alchemy and magic, or to any sk ill in medicine,\" etc.(63) 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The truth may lie between the opposing cont entions of Prof. B ühle and his two masonic antagonists. The Freemasons were clearly, for the reasons given by Mr. Waite, not a mere continuation of the Rosi crucians, but more likely borrowed from the Rosicrucians a part of their system a nd symbols which they adapted to their own purpose. Moreover, the incontrovertible fact is that in the list of English Freemasons and Rosicrucians we find me n who belonged to both Orders and a amongst these two who contributed largely to the cons titutions of English Freemasonry. The first of these is Robert Fludd, whom Mr. Waite describes as \" th e central figure of Rosicrucian literature, . . . an intellectual giant, . . . a man of immense erudition, of exalted mind, and, to judge by his writings, of extreme personal sanctity. Ennemoser describes him as one of the most distingui shed disciples of Paracelsus. . . .\"(64) Yarker adds this clue : \" In 1630 we find Fludd, the chief of the Rosicrucians, using architectural language, and there is proof that his Society was divided into degrees, and from the fact that the Masons' Co mpany of London had a copy of the Masonic Charges ' presented by Mr. fflood ' we may suppose that he was a Freemason before 1620.\"(65) A still more important link is Elias Ashmole, the antiquary, astrologer, and alchemist, founder of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, who was born in 1617. An avowed Rosicrucian, and as we have seen, also a Freemason. Ashmole displayed great energy in reconstituting the Craf t ; he is said to have perfected its organization, to have added to it further mystic symbols, and according to Ragon, it was he who drew up the ritual of the existing three Craft decrees--Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason--which was adopted by Grand L odge in 1717. Whence did these fresh inspirations come but from the Rosicrucians ? For, as Ragon also informs us, in the year that Ashmole was received into Freemas onry the Rosicrucians held their meeting in the same room at Mason Hall !(66) How, then, can it be said that ther e was \" no traceable connexion between Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism \" ? and why should it be the part of a \" malignant reviler \" to connect th em ? It is not suggested that Rosicrucians, such as Fludd or Ashmole, imported any magical elements into Freemasonry, but simply the system and symbols of the Rose-Croix with a certain degree of esoteric learning. That Rosicrucianism form an important link in the chain of the secret tr adition is therefore undeniable. THE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY RABBIS There is, however, a third ch annel through which the Judaic legends of Freemasonry may have penetrated to the Craft, namely, the Rabbis of the seventeenth century. The Jewish writer Bernard Lazare has declared th at \" there were Jews around the cradle of Freemasonry,\"(67) and if this statement is applied to the pe riod preceding the institution of Grand Lodge in 1717 it certainly finds confirmation in fact. Thus it is said that in the preceding century the co at-of-arms now used by Grand Lodge had been designed by an Amsterdam Jew, Jacob Jehuda Leon Templo, colleague of Cromwell's friend the Cabalist, Manasseh be n Israel.(68) To quote Jewish authority on this question, Mr. Lucien Wolf writes th at Templo \"had a monomania for . . . 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"everything relating to the Temple of Solom on and the Tabernacle of the Wilderness. He constructed gigantic models of both thes e edifices.\"(69) These he exhibited in London which he visited in 1675, and earlier , and it seems not unreasonable to conclude that this may have provided a fres h source of inspiration to the Freemasons who framed the masonic ritual some forty ye ars later. At any rate, the masonic coat- of-arms still used by Grand Lodge of England is undoubtedly of Jewish design. \" This coat,\" says Mr. Lucien Wolf, \" is enti rely composed of Jewi sh symbols,\" and is \" an attempt to display heraldically the vari ous forms of the Cherubim pictured to us in the second vision of Ezek iel--an Ox, a Man, a Lion, and an Eagle--and thus belongs to the highest and most mystical domain of Hebrew symbolism.\"(70) In other words, this vision, known to the Je ws as the \" Mercaba,\"(71) belongs to the Cabala, where a particular interpretation is placed on each figure so as to provide an esoteric meaning not perceptib le to the uninitiated.(72) The masonic coat-of-arms is thus entirely Cabalistic as is also the s eal on the diplomas of Craft Masonry, where another Cabalistic figure, that of a man and woman combined, is reproduced.(73) Of the Jewish influence in Masonry after 1717 I shall speak later. To sum up, then, the origins of the system we now know as Freemasonry are not to be found in one source alone. The twelve altern ative sources enumerated in the Masonic Cyclopodia and quoted at the beginning of this chapter may all have contributed to its formation. Thus Operative Masonry may have descended from the Roman Collegia and through the operative masons of the Mi ddle Ages, whilst Speculative Masonry may have derived from the patriarchs and th e mysteries of the pagans. But the source of inspiration which admits of no denial is the Jewish Caba la. Whether this penetrated to our country through the Roman Collegia, the compagnonnages, the Templars, the Rosicrucians, or through the Jews of the se venteenth and eighteen th centuries, whose activities behind the scenes of Freemasonry we shall see later, is a matter of speculation. The fact remains th at when the ritual and cons titutions of Masonry were drawn up in 1717, although certain fragmen ts of the ancient Egyptian and Pythagorean doctrines were retained, the Juda ic version of the secret tradition was the one selected by the founders of Grand L odge on which to build up their system. 1.

Was this secret system employed, however, by any other body of men ? It is certainly easy to imagine how in this momentous seventeenth century, when men of all opinions were coalescing against opposing forces--Luthera ns combining against the Pa pacy, Catholics rallying their forces against invading Protestantism, Republicans plotting in favour of Cromwell, Royalists in their turn plotting to restore the Stuarts, finally Royalists plotting against each other on behalf of riva l dynasties--an organiza tion of this kind, enabling one to work secretly for a cause a nd to set invisibly vast numbers of human beings in motion, might prove invaluable to any party. Thus, according to certain masonic writers on the Continent, the system used by the Rosicrucians in their fight against \" Popery \" was also employed by the Jesuits for a directly opposite purpose. In the manuscripts of the Prince of Hesse published by Lecouteulx de Canteleu it is d eclared that in 1714 the Jesuits used the mysteries of the Rose-Croix. Mirabeau also relate s that \" the Jesuits profited by the internal troubles of the reign of Charles I to possess themselves of the symbols, the allegories, and the carpets (tapis) of the Rose-Croix masons, who were only the ancient order of the Templars secretly perpetuated. It may be seen by means of what imperceptible innovations they succeeded in substituting their catechism to the instruction of the Templars.\"(1) Other Continental writers again assert th at Cromwell, the arch-opponent of the Catholic Church, was \" a higher initiate of masonic mysteries,\" and used the system for his own elevation to power (2) ; further, that he found himsel f outdistanced by the Levellers ; that this sect, whose name certa inly suggest masonic inspiration, adopted for its symbols the square and compass,(3) and in its claim of real equality threatened the supremacy of the usurper. Finally, Elia s Ashmole, the Rosicrucian Royalist, is said to have turned the masonic system agai nst Cromwell, so that towards the end of the seventeenth century the Order ra llied to the Stuart cause.(4) But all this is pure speculati on resting on no basis of known facts. The accusation that the Jesuits used the system of the Rose-Cro ix as a cover to political intrigues is referred to by the Rosicrucian Eliphas Lévi as the outcome of ignorance which \" refutes itself. \" It is significant to noti ce that it emanates mainly from Germany and from the Illuminati ; the Prince of Hesse wa s a member of the Stricte Observance and Mirabeau an Illuminatus at the time he wr ote the passage quoted above. That in the seventeenth century certain Jesuits played th e part of political intriguers I suppose their warmest friends will hardly deny, but th at they employed any secret or masonic system seems to me perfectly incapable of pr oof. I shall return to this point later, however, in connexion w ith the Illuminati. 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"As to Cromwell, the only circumstance that le nds any colour to the possibility of his connexion with Freemasonry is his known fr iendship for Manasseh ben Israel, the colleague of the Rabbi Templo who designed the coat-of-arms later adopted by Grand Lodge. If, therefore, the Jews of Amsterdam were a source of inspiration to the Freemasons of the seventeenth century, it is not impossible that Cromwell may have been the channel through which th is influence first penetrated. In the matter of the Stuarts we are, ho wever, on firm ground with regard to Freemasonry. That the lodges at the end of th e seventeenth century were Royalist is certain, and there seems good reason to beli eve that, when the revolution of 1688 divided the Royalist cause, th e Jacobites who fled to France with James II took Freemasonry with them.(5) With the help of the French they established lodges in which, it is said, masonic rites and symbols were used to promote the cause of the Stuarts. Thus the land of promise signifi ed Great Britain, Jerusalem stood for London, and the murder of Hiram represente d the execution of Charles I.(6) Meanwhile Freemasonry in England did not conti nue to adhere to the Stuart cause as it had done under the egis of Elias Ashmole, and by 1717 is said to have become Hanoverian. From this important date the official history of the present system may be said to begin ; hitherto everything rests on stray documents, of which the authenticity is frequently doubtful, and which provide no continuous history of the Order. In 1717 for the first time Freemasonry was establis hed on a settled basis and in the process underwent a fundamental change. So far it would seem to have retained an operative element, but in the transformation that now took place this was entirely eliminated, and the whole Order was transformed into a middle- and upper-class speculative body. This coup d'état, already suggested in 1703, took place early in 1717, when four London lodges of Freemasons met together at the Apple Tree Tavern in Charles Street, Covent Garden, \" and ha ving put into the chair the ol dest Master Mason (being the Master of the lodge), they constituted themselves a Grand Lodge, pro tempore, in due form.\" On St. John the Baptist's Day, June 24 of the same year, the annual assembly and banquet were held at the Goos e and Gridiron in St. Paul's Churchyard, when Mr. Antony Sayer was elected Grand Mast er and invested with all the badges of office.(7) It is evident from the above account that already in 1717 the speculative elements must have predominated in the lodges, otherwise we might expect to find the operative masons taking some part in these proceedings and expressing their opinion as to whether their association should pass under the control of men entirely unconnected with the Craft. But no, the leader s of the new movement all appear to have belonged to the middle class, nor from this moment do either masons or architects seem to have played any prominent part in Freemasonry. But the point that official history does not at tempt to elucidate is the reason for this decision. Why should Freemasons of London--w hether they were at this date speculative or only a semi-speculative a ssociation--have sudde nly recognized the necessity of establishing a Grand Lodge and drawing up a ritual and \" Constitution \" ? It is evident, then, that some circumstances must have arisen which led them to take this important step. I would suggest that the following may be the solution to the problem. 99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Freemasonry, as we have seen, was a system that could be employed in any cause and had now come to be used by intriguers of every kind--and not only by intriguers, but by merely convivial bodies, \" jolly Brotherhoods of the Bottle \" who modelled themselves on masonic associations.(8) But the honest citi zens of London who met and feasted at the Goose and Gridiron were clearly not intriguers, they were neither Royalist nor Republican plotters, neither Ca tholic nor Luther fanatics, neither alchemists nor magicians, nor can it be suppos ed that they were simply revellers. If they were political, they were certainly not supporters of the Stua rts ; on the contrary, they were generally reported to have been Hanoverian in their symp athies, indeed Dr. Bussell goes so far as to say that Gra nd Lodge was institute d to support the Hanoverian dynasty.(9) It would be perhaps nearer the truth to conclude that if they were Hanoverian it was because they were c onstitutional, and the Hanoverian dynasty having now been established they wished to avoid further changes. In a word, then, they were simply men of peace, anxious to put an end to dissensions, who, seeing that system of Masonry utilized for the purpose of promoting discord, determined to wrest it from the hands of political intriguers a nd restore it to its orig inal character of brotherhood, though not of br otherhood between working masons only, but between men drawn from all classes and professi ons. By founding a Grand Lodge in London and drawing up a ritual and \" Constitutions,\" they hoped to preven t the perversion of their signs and symbols and to establish the Order on a settled basis. According to Nicolai this pacific purpose had already animated English Freemasons under the Grand Mastership of Sir Christopher Wren : \" Its principal object from this period was to moderate the religious hatreds so terrible in England during the reign of James II and to try and establish some kind of concord or fraterni ty, by weakening as far as possible the antagonisms arising from the differences of religions, ranks, and interests.\" An eighteenth-century manuscr ipt of the Prince of Hesse quoted by Lacouteulx de Canteleu expresses the view that in 1717 \" the mysteries of Freemasonry were reformed and purified in England of all politic al tendencies.\" In the matter of religion, Craft Masonry adapte d an equally non-sect arian attitude. The first \" Constitutions \" of the Order, dr awn up by Dr. Anderson in 1723, contain the following paragraph : CONCERNING GOD AND RELIGION A Mason is obliged, by his tenure, to obe y the moral Law ; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist, nor an irreligious Libertine. But though in ancient Times Masons were charged in every Country to be of the Religion of that Country or Nation, whatever it was, yet, 'tis now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which all men agree, leaving their particular Opinions to themselves ; that is to be good Men and true, or Men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Denominations or Pers uasions they may be distinguish'd ; whereby Masonry becomes the Centre of Union and the Means of Conciliating true Friendship among Persons that must have remained at a perpetual Distance. The phrase \" that Religion in which all me n agree \" has been censured by Catholic writers as advocating a universal religion in the place of Christianity. But this by no means follows. The idea is surely that Masons should be men adhering to that law of right and wrong common to all religious faiths. Craft Masonry may t hus be described 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"as Deist in character, but not in the accep ted sense of the word which implies the rejection of Christian doctrine s. If Freemasonry had been Deist in this sense might we not expect to find some connexion between the founders of Grand Lodge and the school of Deists--Toland, Bolingbroke, Woolston, Hume, and others--which flourished precisely at this period ? Might not some analogy be detected between the organization of the Order and the Sodalities described in Toland's Pantheisticon, published in 1720 ? But of this I can find no trace whatever. The principal founders of Grand Lodge were, as we have seen, clergym en, both engaged in preaching Christian doctrines at their respective churches.(10) It is surely therefore reasonable to conclude that Freemasonry at the time of its reorgani zation in 1717 was Deistic only in so far that it invited men to meet together on the common ground of a belief in God. Moreover, some of the early English rituals contain distin ctly Christian elements. Thus both in Jachin and Boaz (1762) and Hi ram or the Grand Master Key to the Door of both Antient and Modern Freemas onry by a Member of the Royal Arch (1766) we find prayers in the lodges concl uding with the name of Christ. These passages were replaced much later by purely Deistic formulas under the Grand Mastership of the free-thinking Duke of Sussex in 1813. But in spite of its innocuous character, Freemasonry, merely by reason of its secrecy, soon began to excite alarm in the public mi nd. As early as 1724 a work entitled The Grand Mystery of the Freemasons Discove red had provoked an angry remonstrance from the Craft (11) ; and when the French edict against the Order was passed, a letter signed \" Jachin \" appeared in The Gentleman's Magazine declaring the \" Freemasons who have lately been suppressed not onl y in France but in Holland to be \" a dangerous Race of Men \" : No Government ought to suffer such clande stine Assemblies where plots against the State may be carried on, under the Preten ce of Brotherly Love and good Fellowship. The writer evidently unaware of possible Temp lar traditions, goes on to observe that the sentinel placed at the door of the lodge w ith a drawn sword in his hand \" is not the only mark of their being a military Order \" ; and suggests that the title of Grand Master is taken in imitation of the Knights of Malta. \" Jachin,\" moreover, scents a Popish plot : They not only admit Turks, Jews, Infidels, bu t even Jacobites, non- jurors and Papists themselves . . . how can we be sure that those Persons who are known to be well affected, are let into all their Mysteries ? They make no scruple to acknowledge that there is a Distinction betw een Prentices and Master Masons and who knows whether they may not have an higher Order of Caba lists, who keep the Grand Secret of all entirely to themselves ?(12) Later on in France, the Abbé Pérau publishe d his satires on Freemasonry, Le Secret des Francs-Maçons (1742), L'Ordre des Francs -Maçons trahi et le Secret des Mopses révélé (1746), and Les Francs-Maçons écrasés (1746),(13) and in about 1761 another English writer said to be a Mason brought down a torrent of invective on his head by the publication of the ritual of the Craf t Degrees under the name of Jachin and Boaz.(14) It must be admitted that from all this controversy no party emerges in a very charitable light, Catholics and Protestants alike indulging in sarcasms and reckless accusations against Freemasonry, the Freemasons retorting with far from brotherly forbearance.(15) But, again, one must remember that all these men were of their age-- 101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"an age which seen through the eyes of Hoga rth would certainly not appear to have been distinguished for delicacy. It should be noted, however, when one reads in masonic works of the \" persecutions to which Freemasonry has been subjected, that aggression was not confined onl y to the one side in the conflict ; moreover, that the Freemasons at this period were divided amongst themselves and expressed with regard to opposing groups much the same su spicions that non-Mas ons expressed with regard to the Order as a whole. For th e years following after the suppression of Masonry in France were marked by the most important development in the history of the modern Order--the inaugurati on of the Additional Degrees. THE ADDITIONAL DEGREES The origin and inspiration of the additional degrees has provoked hardly less controversy in masonic circles than the or igin of Masonry itse lf. It should be explained that Craft Masonry, or Blue Masonry--that is to sa y, the first three degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Mast er Mason of which I have attempted to trace the history--were the onl y degrees recognized by Grand Lodge at the time of its foundation in 1717 and still form the basis of all forms of modern Masonry. On this foundation were erected, somewhere between 1740 and 1743, the degree of the Royal Arch and the first of the series of upper de grees now known as the Scottish Rite or as the Ancient and Accepted Rite. The acceptance or rejection of this superstructure has always formed a subject of violent cont roversy between Masons, one body affirming that Craft Masonry is the only true and genui ne Masonry, the other declaring that the real object of Masonry is only to be f ound in the higher degrees. It was this controversy, centring round the Royal Arch degree, that about the middle of the eighteenth century split Masonry into opposi ng camps of Ancients and Moderns, the Ancients declaring that the R.A. was \" the Root, Heart, and Marrow of Freemasonry,\"(16) the Moderns rejecting it. Although worked by the Ancients from 1756 onwards, this degree was definitely re pudiated by Grand Lodge in 1792,(17) and only in 1813 was officially rece ived into English Freemasonry. The R.A. degree, which is said neverthele ss to be contained in embryo in the 1723 Book of Constitutions,(18) is purely Juda ic--a glorification of Israel and commemorating the building of the second Temple. That it was derived from the Jewish Cabala seems probable, and Ya rker, commenting on the phrase in the Gentleman's Magazine quoted above--\" Who knows whether they (the Freemasons) have not a higher order of Cabalists, who k eep the Grand Secret of all entirely to themselves \" observes : \" It looks very like an intimation of the Royal Arch degree,\"(19) and elsewhere he states that \" the Royal Arch degree, when it had the Three Veils, must have been the work, even if by instru ction, of a Cabalistic Jew about 1740, and from this time we may expect to find a secret tradition grafted upon Anderson's system.\"(20) Precisely in this same year of 1740 Mr. Waite says that \" an itinerant pedlar of the Royal Arch degree is said to have propa gated it in Ireland, claiming that it was practised at York and London,\"(21) and in 1744 a certain Dr. Dassigny wrote that the minds of the Dublin brethren had been la tely disturbed about Royal Arch Masonry 102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"owing to the activities in Dublin of \" a num ber of traders or huck sters in pretended Masonry,\" whom the writer connects with \" Italians \" or the \" Italic Order.\" A Freemason quoting this passage in a recent discussion on the upper degrees expresses the opinion that thes e hucksters were \" Jacobite emissaries disguised under the form of a pretended Masonr y,\" and that \" by Italians and Italian Order he intends a reference to the Court of King James III, i.e. the Old Pretender at Rome, and to the Ecossais (Italic) Order of Mas onry.\"(22) It is much more likely that he had referred to another source of masonic instru ction in Italy which I shall in dicate in a late r chapter. But precisely at the moment when it is sugge sted that the Jacobite s were intriguing to introduce the Royal Arch degree into Masonr y they are also said to have been engaged in elaborating the \" Scottish Rite.\" Let us examine this contention. FREEMASONRY IN FRANCE The foundation of Grand Lodge in London had been followed by the inauguration of Masonic Lodges on the Continent--in 1721 at Mons, in 1725 in Paris, in 1728 at Madrid, in 1731 at The Hague, in 1733 at Ha mburg, etc. Several of these received their warrant from the Grand Lodge of Engl and. But this was not the case with the Grand Lodge of Paris, which did not receive a warrant till 1743. The men who founded this lodge, far from be ing non-political, were Jacobite leaders engaged in active schemes for the restoration of the Stuart dynasty. The leader of the group, Charles Radcliffe, had been imprisoned with his brother, the ill-fated Lord Derwentwater who was executed on Tower Hill in 1716. Charles had succeeded in escaping from Newgate and made his way to France, where he assumed the title of Lord Derwentwater, although the Earldom had ceased to exist under the bill of attainder against his brother. (23) It was this Lord Derwentwater--afterwards executed for taking part in the 1745 rebe llion--who with several other J acobites is said to have founded the Grand Lodge of Paris in 1725, and himself to have become Grand Master. The Jacobite character of the Paris lodge is not a matter of dispute. Mr. Gould relates that \" the colleagues of Lord Derwentwater are stated to have been a Chevalier Maskeline, a Squire Heguerty, and others, all partisans of the Stuarts.\"(24) But he goes on to contest the theory that they used Freemasonry in the Stuart cause, which he regards as amounting to a charge of bad faith. This is surely unreasonable. The founders of Grand Lodge in Paris did not derive from Grand Lodge in London, from which they held no warrant,(25) but, as we have seen, took their Freemasonry with them to France before Grand Lodge of London was instituted ; they were therefore in no way bound by its regulations. And until the Constitutions of Anderson were published in 1723 no rule had been laid down that the Lodges should be non-political. In the old days Freemasonry had always been Royalist, as we see from the ancient charges that members should be \" true liegemen of the King \" ; and if the adherents of James Edward saw in him their rightful sovere ign, they may have conceived that they were using Freemasonry for a lawful purpose in adapting it to his cause. So although we may applaud the decision of the London Freemasons to purge Freemasonry of political tendencies and transform it into a harmonious system of brotherhood, we 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"cannot accuse the Jacobites in France of bad faith in not conforming to a decision in which they had taken no part and in establishing lodges on their own lines. Unfortunately, however, as too frequen tly happens when men form secret confederacies for a wholly honourable purpose, their ranks were penetrated by confederates of another kind. It has been said in an earlier chapte r that, according to the documents produced by the Ordre du Temple in the early part of the nineteenth century, the Templars had never ceased to exis t in spite of their official suppression in 1312, and that a line of Grand Masters had succeeded each other in unbroken succession from Jacques du Molay to the Duc de Cossé-Brissac, who was killed in 1792. The Grand Master appointed in 1705 is stated to ha ve been Philippe, Duc d'Orléans, later the Regent. Mr. Waite has e xpressed the opinion that all this was an invention of the late eight eenth century, and that the Charter of Larmenius was fabricated at this date though not pub lished until 1811 by the revived Ordre du Temple under the Grand Master, Fabré Palaprat. But evidence points to a contrary conclusion. M. Matter, who, as we have seen, disbelieves the story of the Ordre du Temple and the authenticity of the Charter of Larmenius in so far as it professes to be a genuine fourteenth-century document, ne vertheless asserts that the savants who have examined it declare it to date from the early part of the eighteenth century, at which period Matter believes the Gospel of St. John used by the Order to have been arranged so as \" to accompany the ceremoni es of some masonic or secret society.\" Now, it was about 1740 that a revival of Templarism took place in France and Germany ; we cannot therefore doubt that if Matter is righ t in this hypothesis, the secret society in question was that of the Templars, whether they existed as lineal descendants of the twelfth-century Order or merely as a revival of that Order. The existence of the German Templars at this date under the name of the Stricte Observance (which we shall deal with in a fu rther chapter) is indeed a fact disputed by no one ; but that there was also an Or dre du Temple in France at the very beginning of the eighteenth century must be regarded as highly probable. Dr. Mackey, John Yarker, and Lecouteulx de Canteleu (who, owing to his possession of Templar documents, had exclusive sources of informati on) all declare this to have been the case and accept the Charter of Larmenius as authentic. \" It is quite certain,\" says Yarker \" that there was at this period in France an Ordre du Temle, with a charter from John Mark Larmenius, who claimed appointment from Jacques du Molay. Philippe of Orléans accepted the Gra nd Mastership in 1705 and signed the Statutes.\"(26) Without, however, necessarily ac cepting the Charter of Larmen ius as authentic let us examine the probability of this assertion with regard to the Duc d'Orléans. Amongst the Jacobites supporting Lord Derwen twater at the Grand Lodge of Paris was a certain Andrew Michael Ramsay, know n as Chevalier Ramsay, who was born at Ayr near the famous Lodge of Kilwinning, where the Templars are said to have formed their alliance with the masons in 1314. In 1710 Ramsay was converted to the Roman Catholic faith by Fénelon and in 1724 became tutor to the sons of the Pretender at Rome. Mr. Gould has related that during his st ay in France Ramsay had formed a friendship with the Regent, Philippe , Duc d'Orléans, who was Grand Master of the Ordre de Saint-Lazare, instituted dur ing the Crusades as a body of Hospitallers devoting themselves to the care of the lepe rs and which 1608 had been joined to the Ordre du Mont-Carmel. It seems probable from all accounts that Ramsay was a 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Chevalier of the Order, but he cannot have been admitted into it by the Duc d'Orléans, for the Grand Master of the Ordre de Sain t-Lazare was not the Duc d'Orléans but the Marquis de Dangeau, who on his death in 1720, was succeeded by the son of the Regent, the Duc de Chartres.(27) If, then, Ramsay was admitted to any Order by the Regent, it was surely the Ordre du Temple, of which the Regent is said to have been the Grand Master at this date. Now, the infamous character of the Duc d' Orléans is a matter of common knowledge ; moreover, during the Regency--that period of impiety and moral dissolution hitherto unparalleled in the history of France--the chief of council was the Duc de Bourbon, who later placed his mistress the Marquise de Prie and the financier Paris Duverney at the head of affairs, thus cr eating a scandal of such magnit ude that he was exiled in 1726 through the influence of Cardinal Fleu ry. This Duc de Bourbon in 1737 is said to have become Grand Master of the Temple. \" It was thus,\" observes de Canteleu, \" that these two Grand Masters of the Temple degraded the royal authority and ceaselessly increased hatred against the government.\" It would therefore seem stra nge that a man so upright as Ramsay appears to have been, who had moreover but recently been c onverted to the Catholic Church, should have formed a friendship with the dissolute Regent of France, unless there had been some bond between them. But here we have a possible explana tion--Templarism. Doubtless during Ramsay's youth at Kilwinning many Templar traditions had come to his knowledge, and if in France he found hi mself befriended by the Grand Master himself, what wonder that he should have entered into an alliance which resulted in his admission to an Order he had been accustomed to revere and which, moreover, was represented to him as the fons et ori go of the masonic brotherhood to which he also belonged ? It is thus th at we find Ramsay in the very year that the Duc de Bourbon is said to have been made Grand Ma ster of the Temple artlessly writing to Cardinal Fleury asking him to extend his prot ection to the society of Freemasons in Paris and enclosing a copy of the speech which he was to deliver on the following day, March 21, 1737. It is in this famous or ation that for the first time we find Freemasonry traced to the Crusades : At the time of the Crusades in Palestine ma ny princes, lords, and ci tizens associated themselves, and vowed to restore the Temple of the Christians in the Holy Land, and to employ themselves in bringing back their architecture to its first institution. They agreed upon several ancient si gns and symbolic words drawn from the well of religion in order to recognize themselves amongst the heathens and Saracens. These signs and words were only communicated to those who promised solemnly, and even sometimes at the foot of the altar, never to reveal them. This sacred promise was therefore not an execrable oat h, as it has bean called, but a respectable bond to unite Christians of all nationalities into one c onfraternity. Some time afterwards our Order formed an intimate union with the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. From that time our Lodges took the name of Lodges of St John.(28) This speech of Ramsay's has raised a st orm of controversy amongst Freemasons because it contains a very decided hint of a connexion between Templarism and Freemasonry. Mr. Tuckett, in the paper referr ed to above, points out that only the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem are here mentioned,(29) but Ramsay distinctly speaks of \" our Order \" forming a union with the Kn ights of St. John of Jerusalem, and we 105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"know that the Templars did eventually form such a union. The fact that Ramsay does not mention the Templars by name admits of a very plausible explanation. It must be remembered that, as Mr. Gould has shown, a copy of the oration was enclosed by Ramsay in his letter to Cardinal Fleury a ppealing for royal protection to be extended to Freemasonry ; it is therefore hardly lik ely that he would have proclaimed a connexion between the Order he was anxious to present in the most favourable light and one which had formerly been suppre ssed by King and Pope. Moreover, if the Charter of Larmenius to be believed, the ne wly elected Grand Master of the Temple was the Duc de Bourbon, who had already incurred the Cardinal's displeasure. Obviously, therefore, Templar influence was be st kept in the bac kground. This is not to imply bad faith on the part of Ramsay, who doubtless held the Order of Templars to be wholly praiseworthy ; but he could not expect the King or Cardinal to share his view, and therefore held more prudent to refer to the progenitors of Freemason under the vague description of a crusading body. Ramsay's well-meant effort met, however, with no success. Whether on account of this unlucky reference by which the Cardinal may have detected Templar influence or for some other reason, the appeal for royal protection was not only refused, but the new Or der, which hitherto Catholics had been allowed to enter, was now prohibited by Royal edict. In the following year, 1738, the Pope, Clement XII, issued a bull, In Eminenti, banning Freemasonry and excommunicating Catholics who took part in it. But this prohibition appears to have been without effect, for Freemasonry not only prospered but soon began to manufacture new degrees. And in the masonic literature of the following thirty years the Templar tradition becomes still more clearly apparent. Thus the Chevalier de Bérage in a well-known pamphlet, of which the first edition is said to have appeared in 1747,(30) gives the following account of the origins of Freemasonry : This Order was instituted by Godefroi de Bouillon in Palestine in 1330,(31) after the decadence of the Christian armies, and was only communicated to the French Masons some time after and to a very small number, as a reward for the ob liging services they rendered to several of our English and Scottis h Knights, from whom true Masonry is taken. Their Metropolitan Lodge is situated on the Mountain of Heredom where the first Lodge was held in Europe and which exists in all its sp lendour. The General Council is still held there and it is the seal of the Sovereign Grand Master in office. This mountain is situated between the West and North of Scotland at sixty miles from Edinburgh. Apart from the historical confusion of the firs t sentence, this passage is of interest as evidence that the theory of a connexion be tween certain crusading Knights and the Lodge of Heredom of Kilwinning was curre nt as early as 1747. The Baron Tschoudy in his Etoile Flamboyante, which appeared in 1766, says that the crusading origin of Freemasonry is the one officially taught in th e lodges, where candidates for initiation are told that several Knights who had set forth to rescue th e holy places of Palestine from the Saracens \" formed an associati on under the name of Free Masons, thus indicating that their princi pal desire was the reconstruction of the Temple of Solomon,\" that, further, they adopted certain signs, grips, and passwords as a defence against the Saracens, and finally that \" our So ciety . . . fraternized on the footing of an Order with the Knights of St. John of Jerusa lem, from which it is apparent that the Freemasons borrowed the custom of regardi ng St. John as the patron of the whole Order in general.\"(32) After the crusades \" the Masons kept their rites and methods 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"and in this way perpetuated the royal art by establishing lodges, first in England, then in Scotland,\" etc.(33) In this account, therefore, Freemasonry is re presented as having been instituted for the defence of Christian doctrines. De Bérage ex presses the same view and explains that the object of these Crusaders in thus binding themselves toge ther was to protect their lives against the Saracens by enveloping their sacred doctrines in a veil of mystery. For this purpose they made use of Jewish symbolism, which they invested with a Christian meaning. Thus the Temple of Solo mon was used to denote the Church of Christ, the bough of acacia signified the Cro ss, the square and the compass the union between the Old and New Testaments, etc. So \" the mysteries of Masonry were in their principle, and are still, nothing else th an those of the Christian religion.\"(34) Baron Tschoudy, however, declares that all this stops short of the truth, that Freemasonry originated long before the Crusad es in Palestine, and that the real \" ancestors, fathers, authors of the Masons, those illustrious men of whom I will not say the date nor betray the secr et,\" were a \" disciplined body \" whom Tschoudy describes by the name of \" the Knight of the Aurora and Palestine.\" After \" the almost total destruction of the Jewish people \" these \" Knights \" ha d always hoped to regain possession of the domains of their fathers and to rebuild the Temple, and they carefully preserved their \" re gulations and particular liturgy,\" together with a \" sublime treatise \" which was the object of their continual st udy and of their philosophical speculations. Tschoudy further relates that they were students of the \" occult sciences,\" of which alchemy formed a part, and that they had \" abjured the principles of the Jewish religion in order to follow the lights of the Christian faith.\" At the time of the Crusades the Knights of Pa lestine came out from the desert of the Thebad, where they had remained hidden, a nd joined to themselves some of the crusaders who had remained in Jerusalem. Declaring that they were the descendants of the masons who had worked on the Temple of Solomon, they professed to concern themselves with \" speculative architecture,\" wh ich served to disguise a more glorious point of view. From this time they to ok the name of Free Masons, presented themselves under this title to the crus ading armies and assembled under their banners.(35) It would of course be absurd to regard any of the foregoing accounts as historical facts ; the important point is that they tend to prove the fallacy of supposing that the Johannite-Templar theory originated with the revived Ordre du Temple, since one corresponding to it so closely was current in the middle of the preced ing century. It is true that in these earlier accounts the actual words \" Joha nnite \" and \" Templar \" do not occur, but the resemblance between the s ect of Jews professing the Christian faith but possessing a \" particular liturgy \" and a \" sublime treatise \"--apparently some early form of the Cabala--dealing with occult scie nce, and the Mandans or Johannites with their Cabalistic \" Book of Adam,\" their B ook of John, and their r itual, is at once apparent. Further, the allusi ons to the connexion between the Knights who had been indoctrinated in the Holy Land and the Scot tish lodges coincides exactly with the Templar tradition, published not only by the Ordre du Temple but handed down in the Royal Order of Scotland. From all this the following facts stand out : (1) that whilst British Craft Masonry traced its origin to the operative guilds of masons, the Freemasons of France from 1737 onwards placed the origin of the Order in crusading chivalry ; (2) that it was 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"amongst these Freemasons that the upper degr ees known as the Scottish Rite arose ; and (3) that, as we shall now see, these de grees clearly suggest Templar inspiration. The earliest form of the upper degrees appe ars to have been the one given by de Bérage, as follows : 1. Parfait Maçon Élu. 2. Élu de Perignan. 3. Élu des Quinze. 4. Petit Architecte. 5. Grand Architecte. 6. Chevalier de l'Épée et de Rose-Croix. 7. Noachite ou Chevalier Prussien. The first of these to make its appearance is believed to have been the one here assigned to the sixth place. This degree know n in modern Masonry as \" Prince of the Rose-Croix of Heredom or Knight of the Pelican and Eagle \" became the eighteenth and the most important degree in what was later called the Scottish Rite, or at the present time in England the Ancient and Accepted Rite. Why was this Rite called Scottis h ? \" It cannot be too strong ly insisted on,\" says Mr. Gould, \" that all Scottish Masonry has nothi ng whatever to do with the Grand Lodge of Scotland, nor, with one possible exception- -that of the Royal Order of Scotland-- did it ever originate in that country.\"(36) But in the cas e of the Rose-Croix degree there is surely so justificati on for the term in legend, if not in proven fact, for, as we have already seen, according to the tradi tion of the Royal Order of Scotland this degree had been contained in it since the four teenth century, when the degrees of H.R. (Heredom) and R.S.Y.C.S. (Rosy Cross) are said to have been instituted by Robert Bruce in collaboration with the Templars after the battle of Bannockburn. Dr. Mackey is one ofthe few Masons who admit this probable affiliation, and in referring to the tradition of the Royal Order of Scotland obser ves : \" From that Order it seems to us by no means improbable that the present degr ee of Rose-Croix de Heredom may have taken its origin.\"(37) But the Rose-Croix degree, like the Templar tradition from which it appears to have descended, is capable of a dual interpretation, or rather of a multiple interpretation, for no degree in Masonry has been subject to so many variation. That on the Continent it had descended through the Rosicrucians in an alchemical form seems more than probable. It would certainly be difficult to believe that a degree of R.S.Y.C.S. was imported from the East and incorporated in the Royal Order of Scotland in 1314 ; that by a mere coincidence a man named Christ ian Rosenkreutz was--according to the Rosicrucian legend--born in the same century and transmitted a secret doctrine he had discovered in the East to the seventeenth-centur y Brethren of the Rosy Cross ; and finally, that a degree of the Rose-Cro ix was founded circ. 1741 without any connexion existing between these succeeding movements. Even if we deny direct affiliation, we must surely admit a common source of inspiration producing, if not a continuation, at any rate a periodic revival of the same ideas. Dr. Oliver indeed admits affiliation between the seventeenth-century fraternity and the eighteenth-century degree, and after pointing out that the first indication of the Rose-Croix degree appears in the Fama Fraternita tis in 1613, goes on to say : It was known much sooner, although not pr obably as a degree in Masonry, for it 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"existed as a cabalistic science from the earlie st times in Egypt, Greece, and Rome, as well as amongst the Jews and Moors in times more recent, and in our own country the names of Roger Bacon, Fludd, Ashmole, and many others are found in its list of adepts.(38) Dr. Mackey, quoting this passage, observes that \" Oliver confounds the masonic Rose-Croix with the alchemical Rosicrucians,\" and proceeds to give an account of the Rose-Croix degree as worked in England and America, which he tr uly describes as \" in the strictest sense a Christian degree.\"(39 ) But the point Dr. Mackey overlooks is that this is only one version of the degree, which, as we shall see later, has been and still is worked in a very diffe rent manner on the Continent. It is, however, certain that the version of the Rose-Croix degree first adopted by the Freemasons of France in about 1741 was not onl y so Christian but so Catholic in character as to have given rise to the belief that it was de vised by the Jesuits in order to counteract the attacks of which Catholic ism was the object.(40) In a paper on the Additional Degrees Mr. J.S. Tackett writes : There is undeniable evidence that in their ear lier forms the Ecossais or Scots Degrees were Roman Catholic ; I have a MS. Ritual in French of what I believe to be the original Chev. de l'Aigle or S.P.D.R.C. (S ouverain Prince de Rose-Croix), and in it the New Law is declared to be \" la foy Catholique,\" and the Baron Tschoudy in his L'Etoile Flamboyante of 1766 describes the same Degree as \" le Catholicisme mis en grade \" (Vol. in. p. 114). I suggest that Ecossais or Scots Masonry was intended to be a Roman Catholic as well as a Stuart form of Freemasonr y, into which none but those devoted to both Restorations were to be admitted.(41) But is it necessary to read this political in tention into the degree ? If the tradition of the Royal Order of Scotland is to be believe d, the idea of the Rose-Croix degree was far older than the Stuart cause, and date d back to Bannockburn, when the degree of Heredom with which it was coupled was institut ed in order \" to corr ect the errors and reform the abuses which had crept in among the three degrees of St. John's Masonry,\" and to provide a \" Christianized form of th e Third Degree,\" \" purified of the dross of paganism and even of Judaism.\"(42) Whether the antiquity attributed to these degrees can be proved or not, it certainly appears pr obable that the legend of the Royal Order of Scotland had some foundation in fact and therefore that the ideas embodied in the eighteenth-century Rose-Croix degree may ha ve been drawn from the store of that Order and brought by the Jacobites to France. At the same time there is no evidence in support of the statement made by certain Cont inental writers that Ramsay actually instituted this or any of the upper degrees. On the contrary, in his Oration he expressly states that Freemasonry is composed of the Craft de grees only : We have amongst us three kinds of brothers : Novices or Apprentices, Fellows or Professed Brothers, Masters or Perfected Brethren. To th e first are explained the moral virtues ; to the second the heroic virtues ; to the last the Christian virtues. . . . It might be said then that the Rose-Croix degree was here foreshadowed in the Masters' degree, in that the latter definite ly inculcated Christianity. This would be perfectly in accord with Rams ay's point of view as set forth in his account of conversion by Fénelon. When he first met the Archbishop Cambrai in 1710, Ramsay relates that he had lost faith in Christian sects and had resolved to \" take refuge in a wise Deism limited to respect for the Divinity and for the immutable ideas of pure virtue,\" but that his conver sation with Fénelon led him to accept the Catholic faith. 109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"And he goes on to show that \" Monsieur de Cambrai turned Atheists into Deists, Deists into Christians, and Christians in to Catholics by sequence of ideas full of enlightenment and feeling.\"(43) Might not this be the proce ss which Ramsay aimed at in troducing into Freemasonry-- the process which in fact does form part of the masonic system in England to-day, where the Atheist must become, at least by profession, a Deist before he can be admitted to the Craft Degrees, whilst the Rose-Croix degree is reserved solely for those who profess the Christian faith ? Such was undoubtedly the idea of the men who introduced the Rose-Croix degree into Fr ance ; and Ragon, who gives an account of this \" Ancien Rose-Croix Francais \"--which is almost identical with the degree now worked in England, but long since abandoned in France--objects to it on the very score of its Christia n character.(44) In this respect the Rose-Croix amongst all the upper degrees intr oduced to France in the middle of the eighteenth century sta nds alone, and it alone can with any probability be attributed to Scottish Jacobite inspiration. It was not , in fact, until three or four years after Lord Derwentwater or his mysterious successor Lord Harnouester (45) had resigned the Grand Mastership in favour of the Duc d'Antin in 1738 that the additional degrees were first he ard of, and it was not until ei ght years after the Stuart cause had received its deathblow at Culloden, that is to sa y, in 1754, that the Rite of Perfection in which the so-called Scots Degr ees were incorporated was drawn up in the following form : RITE OF PERFECTION 1. Entered Apprentice. 2. Fellow Craft. 3. Master Mason. 4. Secret Master. 5. Perfect Master. 6. Intimate Secretary. 7. Intendant of the Buildings. 8. Provost and Judge. 9. Elect of Nine. 10. Elect of Fifteen. 11. Chief of the Twelve Tribes. 12. Grand Master Architect. 13. Knight of the Ninth Arch. 14. Ancient Grand Elect. 15. Knight of the Sword. 16. Prince of Jerusalem. 17. Knight of the East and West. 18. Rose-Croix Knight. 19. Grand Pontiff. 110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"20. Grand Patriarch. 21. Grand Master of the Key of Masonry. 22. Prince of Libanus or Knight of the Royal Axe. 23. Sovereign Prince Adept. 24. Commander of the Black and White Eagle. 25. Commander of the Royal Secret.(46) We have only to glance at the nomenclature of the last twenty-two of these degrees to see that on the basis of operative Masonry there has been built up a system composed of two elements : crusading chivalry and Judaic traditi on. What else is this but Templarism ? Even Mr. Gould, usually so re ticent on Templar influence, admits it at this period : In France . . . some of the Scots lodges woul d appear to have very early manufactured new degrees, connecting these very distingu ished Scots Masons with the Knights Templar, and thus given rise to the subse quent flood of Templarism. The earliest of all are supposed to have been the Masons of Lyons, who invented the Kadosch degree, representing the vengeance of the Temp lars, in 1741. From that time new rites multiplied in France and German but all those of French origin contain Knightly, and almost all Templar grades. In every case th e connecting link was composed of one or more Scots degrees.(47) The name Kadosch here mentioned is a Hebrew word signifying \"holy \" or \" consecrated,\" which in the Cabala is found in conjunction with the Tetragrammaton.(48) The degree is said to have developed fro m that of Grand Elect,(49) one of the three \" degrees of vengeance \" celebrating with sanguinary realism the avenging of the murder of Hiram. But in its final form of Knight Kadosch- -later to become the thirtieth degree of the \" Ancient and Acce pted Scottish Rite \"--the Hiramic legend was changed into the histor y of the Templars with Jacques du Molay as the victim.(50) So the re probation of attack on authority personified by the master- builder becomes approbation of attack on authority in the person of the King of France. The introduction of the upper de grees with their political and, later on, anti-Christian tendencies thus marked a complete depart ure from the fundamental principle of Freemasonry that \" nothing concerning the religion or government shall ever be spoken of in the lodge.\" For this reason th ey have been assailed not only by anti- masonic writers but by Freemasons themselves.\"(51) To represent Barruel and Robison as the enemies of Freemasonry is th erefore absolutely false ; neither of these men denounced Craft Masonry as practised in England, but only the superstructure erected on the Continent. Barruel indeed incurs the reproaches of Mounier for his championship of English Freemasons : He vaunts their respect for re ligious opinion and for author ity. When he speaks of Freemasons in general they are impious, re bellious successors of the Templars and Albigenses, but all those of England are i nnocent. More than this, all the Entered Apprentices, Fellow Crafts, and Master Masons in all parts of the world are innocent ; there are only guilty ones in the higher degrees, which are not essential to the institution, and are sought by a small number of people.(52) 111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"In this opinion of Barruel's a great number of Masonic writers concur--Clavel, Ragon, Rebold, Thory, Findel, and othe rs too numerous to menti on ; all indicate Craft Masonry as the only true kind and the upper de grees as constituting a danger to the order. Rebold, who gives a list of these writers, quotes a masonic publication, authorized by the Grand Orient and the Supreme Council of Fran ce, in which it is said that \" from all these rites there result the most foolish conceptions, . . . the most absurd legends, . . . the most extravagant systems, the most immoral principles, and those the most dangerous for the peace and pr eservation of States,\" and that therefore except the first three degrees of Masonry, wh ich are really ancien t and universal, everything is \" chimera, extravagance, futili ty, and lies.\"(53) Did Barruel and Robison ever use stronger language than this ? To attribute the perversion of Masonry to Jacobite influence would be absurd. How could it be supposed that either Ramsay or Lord Derwentwater (who died as a devout Catholic on the scaffold in 1746) could ha ve been concerned in an attempt to undermine the Catholic faith or the monarchy of France ? I would suggest, then, that the term \" Scots Masonry \" became simply a veil for Templarism--Templarism, moreover, of a very different kind to that from which the original degree of the Rose- Croix was derived. It was this so-called Scots Masons that , after the resignation of Lord Derwentwater, \" boldly came forward a nd claimed to be not merely a part of Masonry but to greater privileges and the ri ght to rule over the ordinary, i.e. Craft Masonry.\"(54) The Grand Lodge of France seems, however, to have realized the danger of submitting to the domination of the Templar element, and on the death of the Duc d'Antin and his replacement by the Comte de Clermont in 1743, signified its adherence to English Craft Masonry by procla iming itself Grande Loge Anglaise de France and reissued the \" Constitutions \" of Anderson, first published in 1723, with the injunction that the Scots Masters should be placed on the same level as the simple Apprentices and Fellow Crafts and allowe d to wear no badges of distinction.(55) Grand Lodge of England appears to have b een reassured by this proclamation as to the character of Freemasonry, for it was now , in 1743, that it at last delivered a warrant to Grand Lodge of Fran ce. Yet in reality it was from this moment that French Freemasonry degenerated the most rapi dly. The Order was soon invaded by intriguers. This was rendered all the easie r by the apathy of the Comte de Clermont, appointed Grand Master in 1743, who seems to ha ve taken little interest in the Order and employed a substitute in the person of a dancing master named Lacorne, a man of low character through whose influence the lodges fell into a state of anarchy. Freemasonry was thus divided into warring factions : Laco rne and the crowd of low- class supporters who had followed him into the lodges founded a Grand Lodge of their own (Grande Loge L acorne), and in 1756 the orig inal Freemasons again attempted to make Craft Masonry the na tional Masonry of France by deleting the word \" Anglaise \" from the appellation of Grand Lodge, and renaming it \" Grande Loge Nationale de France.\" But many lodge s still continue to work the additional degrees. The rivalry between the two groups became so violent that in 1767 the government intervened and closed down Grand Lodge. The Templar group had, however, formed two se parate associations, the \" Knights of the East \" (1756) and the \" Council of the Empe rors of the East and West \" (1758). In 1761 a Jew named Stephen Morin was sent to America by the a \" Emperors \" armed 112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"with a warrant from the Duc de Clermont and Grand Lodge of Paris and bearing the sonorous title of \" Grand Elect Perfect and Sub lime Master,\" with orders to establish a Lodge in that country. In 1766 he was accu sed in Grand Lodge of \" propagating strange and a monstrous doctrines \" and his patent of Grand Inspector was withdrawn.(56) Morin, however, had succeeded in establishing the Rite of Perfection. Sixteen Inspectors, nearly all Jews, were now appointed. These included Isaac Long, Isaac de Costa, Moses Hayes, B. Spitser, Moses Cohen, Abraham Jacobs, and Hyman Long. Meanwhile in France the clos ing of Grand Lodge had not prevented meetings of Lacorne's group, which, on the death of the Duc de Clermont in 1772, instituted the \" Grand Orient \" with the Duc de Chartres--the future \" Philippe Egalité \"--as Grand Master. The Grand Orient then invited the Grande Loge to revoke the decree of expulsion and unite with it, and this offer being accepted, the revolutionary party inevitably carried all before it, and the Duc de Chartres was declared Grand Master of all the councils, chapters, and Scotch lodge s of France.(57) In 1782 the \" Council of Emperors \" and the \" Knights of the East \" combined to form the \" Grand Chapitre Général de France,\" which in 1786 joined up with the Grand Orient. The victory of the revolutionary party was then complete. It is necessary to enter into all these tedious details in order to understand the nature of the factions grouped together under the banner of Ma sonry at this period. The Martinist Papus attributes the revolutionary influences that now prevailed in the lodges to their invasion by the Templars, and goes on to explain that this was owing to a change that had taken place in the Or dre du Temple. Under the Grand Mastership of the Regent and his successor the Duc de Bourbon, the revolutionary elements amongst the Templars had had full play, but from 1741 onwards the Grand Masters of the Order were supporters of the monarchy. When the Revolution came, the Duc de Cossé-Brissac, who had been Grand Ma ster since 1776, perished amongst the defenders of the throne. It was thus that by the middle of the century the Order of the Temple ceased to be a revolutionary force, and the discontented elements it had contained, no longer able to find in it a re fuge, threw themselves into Freemasonry, and entering the higher degrees turned them to their subversive purpose. According to Papus, Lacorne was a member of the Templar group, and the disse nsions that took place were principally a fight between the ex-Templars and the genuine Freemasons which ended in the triumph of the former : Victorious rebels thus founde d the Grand Orient of France. So a contemporary Mason is able to write : \" It is not excessive to say that the masonic revolution of 1773 was the prelude and the precursor of the Revolu tion of 1789.\" What must be well observed is the secret action of the Br others of the Templar Rite. It is they who are the real fomentors of revolution, the othe rs are only docile agents.(58) But all this attributes the baneful influence of Templarism to the French Templars alone, and the existence of such a body rests on no absolutely certain evidence. What is certain and admits of no denial on the part of any hist orian, is the inauguration of a Templar Order in Germany at the very mome nt when the so-called Scottish degrees were introduced into French Masonry. We sh all now return to 1738 and follow events that were taking place at this important moment beyond the Rhine. 113"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"1.
