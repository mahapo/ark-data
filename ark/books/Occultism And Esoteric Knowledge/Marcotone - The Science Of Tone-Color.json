Nevertheless, experience has taught us that copies of a former publication did frequently get into the hands of ripe scholars and others, who requested its author to explain the source of his discoveries and those deductions which have led to the birth of a new science. Accordingly, the state- ments which appear in the first four chapters are made for those interested in M ARCOTONE as a science; but they have nothing to do with the practical side of the present volume, and those who study its pages are in no way required to compre- hend some unavoidable technical terms. References to “Standard Edition” are to the com- plete treatise on this subject by the same author, under the title of M ARCOTONE ."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION The doctrine of automatism advocated as the essen- tial necessity of M ARCOTONE was clearly defined by Lamarck when he stated his law: “the function creates the organ,” for science verifies its assertion that life is the sum of habit. B IOLOGY brings us face to face with the Origin of Things only because of the parallelism between S OUND and L IGHT ; for life is obtained, maintained, and understood as a “parallel series of different scales of magnitude.” Therefore, the primary mode for studying life is through V IBRATION , which devel- ops into spirals, or octaves, through oscillatory, periodic motion. This genetic discovery of Biology was proved through the analytic acquaintance with that builder of cosmos, S OUND . Octaves of periodic movement differ from each other merely through their numerical coefficients. (See Table and Chart, page 38.) What the ear fails to register, the apperceptibility of the eye reaches when sound-waves are transferred to cylindrical movements. We know that what the far-seeing mind of Fresnel did with Descartes’ and Huyghens’ considerations, Clerk Maxwell illuminat- ingly projected into a more exact and applicable science, so that mental conception progressed from a theory of the “oscillatory motion of ether” to the demonstrable periodic oscillation of its electro- 1"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"2   MARCOTONE magnetic status. For Maxwell discovered that a scale distinct yet nevertheless parallel to the scale of sonorous vibrations existed, a scale whose prime nucleus is the spectrum of white light. Since Maxwell’s day our knowledge has been increased by the radial dis- coveries of Kelvin, Crookes, Roentgen, Hertz, Becquerel and others. Today still further intimacy into the mystery of motion has been gained by Thomson, Curie, Rutherford, Bragg and their con- temporaries in exact science. Le Dantec, in his book T HE N ATURE AND O RI - GIN OF L IFE , gives us the familiar example of a prismatic aura formed in a waterfall’s spray, show- ing that this rainbow of light is not displaced by the motion of the water drops, which proves that either phenomenon is independent of the other, disclosing the fact that the spectrum formed is of the same order of magnitude as the movement of sound. This deduction is: “light acts on the chemical reactions of life, sound on its colloidal manifesta- tions.” The upshot of such finding is: “vibratory motion, which occupies so considerable a place in science today, was first verified in phenomena by sound . . . scholars finding a first continuous series of phenomena equally comparable with each other through simple numerical coefficients.” This is now termed scaling, and this model of vibratory motion is hardly likely to be subject to any future change. Humans should be interested to know that pro- toplasms are declared by science to be colloid, for this is the keystone of biology."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  3 A remarkable biological phenomenon is, that al- though “chemistry deals with atomic or molecular dimensions, the colloid state on the contrary relates to activities of a dimension far superior to that of molecular reactions; ” yet they take place, simulta- neously, “along two different scales of magnitude.” Therefore, “living substances which are sensitive to sound are also sensitive to light.” Le Dantec, agreeably with the findings of Willard Gibbs, fur- thermore states : “a sound vibration may determine, secondarily, a chemical modification, having set the suspended particles in motion; reciprocally, a lumi- nous vibration may determine, secondarily, a modi- fication of the colloidal state, having produced certain chemical reactions.” Therefore, “not only L IFE . . . bestrides other series of phenomena so widely separated as sound vibrations and luminous vibrations on the one hand, and molecular and chemical reactions and particle and colloidal varia- tions on the other; but L IFE also sets up a connec- tion between two series of phenomena which appear as complete strangers to one another.” T HESE F ACTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO A LL T RUE S CIENCE AND A RT BECAUSE THEY ARE L IFE ITSELF . Let us make it very clear that the tools for locat- ing and analyzing L IFE are biologically proved to be S OUND and L IGHT (Tone-Color), expressing to their fullest possibilities the phenomena of equilibrium peculiar and particular to chemical and molecular action and reaction. If, therefore, sound-waves influence protoplasmic"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"4   MARCOTONE matter and light-waves do analogously the same with all chemical substances which are the constituents of protoplasm, it proves beyond contradiction that all life is in the colloid state, the seat of chemical reactions, and therefore is necessarily a harmonious correlation between chemical activity and colloidal equilibrium. If this is scientifically established, how can man expect the fulness of his powers to become conscious until these biological laws are not only indexed and tabulated in laboratory and library, but do auto- matically respond within the center of his own being? To this end is M ARCOTONE , S CIENCE OF T ONE - C OLOR ; for the human scale of temperament must logically coincide with the universal scale of tem- perature, so that Space correlates with Time. Under such conditions universal harmony is an actual human attainment, for motion then becomes emo-, tion, reciprocally, a transcendent example of natural equilibrium. Thermo-dynamics, or, better, the incoming science of Chemico-Physics, will add immeasurably to our understanding; in fact, the subconscious is being located. Humanity’s inner eye is being illumined in all physical sciences through the Law of Inter- ference, which we might term the “chromatism” of Nature’s Gamut of Vibration. It was through the resonator that the Approxi- mate Law at the dawn of the applied sciences was discovered and termed timbre, i.e., the specific dif- ference of sounds having the same pitch but varying"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  5 in quality of tone. This law is as indispensable to both chemistry and physics as it is to music. Is it not high time, if this new vision of man has been extended only through the correlation of S OUND and L IGHT , that our arts and sciences of music are verified and reorganized through this same naturally ordered manner? In the living animal, including Man, the phenomenon of equilibrium takes a par- ticular form that is characteristic of life, habit. Habit with living beings, and equilibrium pure and simple with non-living beings, are the two factors of what is termed universal harmony. In this elementary course of M ARCOTONE, it is not consistent with its purposes to set forth in detail the mathematical and other precise formulae which were necessary for its establishment as the Science of Tone-Color. (The Chart which is given will be sufficient evidence for this present work to show the correlation between sound-waves and light-waves as applied to music.) The following may be termed the premises of our Science of Tone- Color. N UMBER Number is the universal ideographic language, being the source of cosmic, religious and scientific symbolism. The Symbolism of Number, expressed, becomes the Law of Motion, generating space and producing life in all its forms."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"6   MARCOTONE Life governed by Number transforms motion into emotion, creating time, so that Life produces Love. These facts prove that physical law is created to evolve moral law. T ONE Silence decomposed through number is sound, the source of spheric and human M USIC . Fundamentally, all forms of vibration are gener- ated by and are transmutable into sound; therefore sound is the origin, even as it is the architect and builder of form. Sound is the creator, preserver and also the destroyer of all forms; because all things depend upon the multiple variety of sound for their infinite variety of form. Basically, geometry is the root of the universe and therefore of all natural forms, including human architectonical forms. Geometry is created by sound. Simple experiments, proving such to be a fact in Nature, are those geometrical forms obtained from Lycopodium spores under the influence of a series of isochronous harmonics. These spores placed on a drumhead and ‘set in motion form geometrical designs correlated to the harmonics from which they are generated. The vibrations of steel forks of fixed pitches, when shown in shadows cast into mirrors, form patterns which can be thrown through a lens upon a screen and the invisible tone thus becomes visible, as perfectly ordered geometrical figures. Therefore, it is evident that universes and"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  7 all appertaining to them are embodied M USI C , the effects of sound as musical proportions. The human voice and musical instruments are capable of elaborating the forms of ferns, flowers and trees, because the vegetable kingdom is gener- ated, geometrically, by sound which creates their forces and distributes their types through numbered motion. The vibrations of any given tone are exclusively in a given direction, and therefore the interferences of swinging pendulums, which result in such complexi- ties of form as shells in which both the angles and curves are geometrically perfect, simply modify each other, reproducing the reality of these vibrations which such interference has modified. The crystalloid serves the vegetable world as the crystal serves the mineral world, showing through the power of sound the completeness and harmony of nature. Motion, as numbered vibrations, governs all sys- tems of Life, its variety in velocity causing differ- ences in the physical aspect of its material composi- tion. In either case, crystal or crystalloid, the axes make their appearance when duly formed by the Law of Numbers, geometrically, through sound. In the mineral world every crystal takes its form from certain sound-built axes of direction and the more complexly elaborate the crystals are, the more numerous must of necessity be the axes whose center is the heart of the crystal. As with crystal- loids the results inevitably depend on tonally created"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"8 MARCOTONE geometry, for the differences in both solely depend on the basic arrangement of their axes. COLOR Experimentation has proved that light is gener- ated and involves as a dual manifestation under the causal protection of sound. From a statical concep- tion sometimes termed “cold flame,” fire is generated as radiant heat, or radiancy, because friction implies heat. Again, the action of such dualism is to create moisture, water. Thus, it follows, the elements are made. Sound paternally fostering light, Nature proceeds to energize the universe as zones, octaves, or spirals of motion; for spheres of magnetism, electricity, radio-activity spirally build cosmos from chaos, so that time shall fill space. The correlation of sound and light is demonstrated by throwing differing rays of light upon a multi- colored glass ball, and where correlation exists between the light-waves and the colors in the ball, tone is generated, because the transmutation between light-waves and sound-waves is thereby effected. Furthermore, Bell’s experiment with selenium disks shows how light-waves are transformed into sound-waves and then into galvanic waves, to re-become sound-waves. Recent invention has produced an instrument of precision which transposes vocal and instrumental music into color. Camille Flammarion states: “The notes (seven octaves) of the scale are nothing else"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  9 but ratios of numbers between sonorous vibrations . . . but a matter of figures.” A. A. Michaelson asserts: “All phenomena of the physical universe are only different manifestations of the various modes of motion. . . .” Professors Mills and Milliken lay down the prin- ciple that: “Sound and light are identical except in the length of their waves and the nature of the media which act as their carriers.” The great acoustical authority, John Tyndall, in his exhaus- tive work, S OUND (see pages 319-320), gives a decisive and what he terms “a beautiful” experiment, which, he asserts, proves “the perfect analogy between light and sound.” This momentous addition to science was described and illustrated before the Royal Institution, Eng- land. Elaborating upon this, Tyndall concludes the first part of his magnum opus, S OUND , with the following words : “Thus far, therefore, we have placed our subject in the firm grasp of experiment; nor shall we find this test failing us further on.” Science has never found this discovery to fail, and now applies its “perfect analogy” to art, with re- sults not alone portentous to music, but equally to the sister arts of painting, decorating, etc. Those aspiring students who would learn of cosmic H AR - MONY which created the universe, so that they may religiously create their works to accord with the fundamentals of natural law, will do well to study M ARCOTON E , S CIENCE OF T ON E -C OLOR ."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"10  MARCOTONE Further substantiated proofs of Tone-Color corre- lation must be sought for in the standard edition of M ARCOTONE ; for this present book, as we have already stated, is to teach its elementary practices. Although the method set forth herein relates to the conscious mastery of reading, memorizing and writ- ing chord-forms, the vital question today is to get the whole world a-singing, through mastery of melody, the automatic mental control of melodic lines. Melody controls comparatively all vocal and instru- mental music. For practical purposes, excepting the piano, organ, harmonium, harp and the study of musical theory and composition, the melodic line governs the world’s present-day music. It is the purpose of this volume first of all to implant this simple yet vital fact in the mind of the general public and, further, to show how to control the power of unconscious melodic mastery as a humanly automatic function.

Vibration is the Universal Law. II . The mental faculty to apperceive vibration in the world of phenomena as light-waves in the element ether is a law of atavism forced upon the mind of Man as color and form through the develop- ment of the organ of seeing, which has established this phenomenon upon the consciousness. III . The same mental faculty which is capable of dealing with the phenomenon of Light through the eye and the mind can be utilized in the world of phenomena in another element, the air, and through another sense organ, the ear, because in principle it is the same faculty which pertains to both phenomena. IV . Natural causes during vast periods of time have, from the foregoing principles, evolved the subconsciousness to the point of willing color and form before the human mind; but these same causes have not obtained the same phenomenal results in the realm of sound which they have in the domain of light. Therefore, the normal mind does not ap- perceive the precise movements of tonal-pitch, which, between air, ear and mind, are equivalent to the precise movements of light-waves between ether, eye 13"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"14  MARCOTONE and mind. Yet, applying the laws of correspondence and analogy to this same principle, which conforms to the law of vibration, that which has developed one natural phenomenon subject to vibration will develop the other. v. One prime cause can produce two kinds of phenomena if the natural law which governs the one governs the other. Therefore, since Color is a natural, spontaneous and involuntary act of the mind governed by one prime cause, so Tone, gov- erned by the same prime cause, can become one and indivisible with Color. This Tone-Color system is M ARCOTONE."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"ABSOLUTE PITCH  15 CHAPTER II ABSOLUTE PITCH; CONSCIOUSNESS OF TONE A BSOLUTE P ITCH A child learns to eat, walk and talk, and after months of continued effort is able to do so without apparent thought, i.e., automatically. In like manner all habits once formed become “second nature” to us and are, indeed, our life. If the Tone-Color system, M ARCOTONE, be conscien- tiously followed until the first awkward struggles have given way to the natural simplicity of the workings of this science within us, then we shall have acquired through its practices Absolute Pitch. For practical use in music there are about seven octaves, ranging from the contra-octave to the four- times-accented octave. We nominate the fundamental tone 256, the prime or root of the natural octave, because an open pipe 26 inches in length and filled with air executes 256 vibrations (termed the middle or once-accented C ' or do ) in a second of time and which naturally forms a 52-inch sound-wave. To compute the ve- locity of sound, it is then necessary to multiply the number of vibrations (256) by the length of its sound-wave, obtaining as a result the speed of 1,120 feet per second. (See Table and Chart, page 38.)"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"16 MARCOTONE If the middle or natural octave (the once-accented octave, the octave which ranges in pitch from 256 to 512 pulsations per second), the center of our isochronous-sounding keyboard, is a fixed crystalli- zation, an inbuilt, lasting structure of that part of our mental equipment which we term subconscious- ness, then by extending our mental vision in either direction from the middle octave, we find that we can easily, distinctly and immediately discern the graver bass or the acuter treble octaves below and above our subconsciously poised natural octave of twelve chromatic tones. Bass ward, ever more slowly produced, but always the same ratio; trebleward, ever more rapidly produced, but always the same ratio. Therefore, having once mastered the middle or natural octave, our command over these raised or lowered octaves (which are only graver or acuter facsimilies of our natural octave) is equally spon- taneous and involuntary as with the natural octave, which, instead of being a mere mechanical expression of our vocal or instrumental studies, is now a per- manent superstructure of our subconscious mind, an organized and perfectly developed attribute of the intellect. This subconscious superstructure is a definite and ordered crystallization of twelve tone- colors, each tone-color an independent, fixed, yet correlated, part of the whole of our new and de- liberately acquired mental faculty, viz: Absolute Pitch of the chromatic scale, which is the base and fundamental property of music. The scale of even temperament, marcotonely, signifies the decompo-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ABSOLUTE PITCH  17 sition of the spiral or octave of sound into twelve fundamental tones, six primes and six complemen- taries. Each tone is separated by the distance of an interval (not to be confounded with diatonic intervals), which has the value of >$ or 1.059. (See Chart, page 38.) Such a conclusion, borne out by scientific facts, offers no reasonable grounds for argument. Having obtained interiorly the twelve degrees of the tone- color scale, the mastery of all musical material is ours! As mankind has raised its conception of color to the subconscious plane where the intuitive apper- ception of color is independent of sense and free to automatically act at the urge of will alone, so, when M ARCOTONE is mastered, the student has forever ob- tained a command of those tone-vibrations which comprise the full capacity allotted to all vocal and instrumental music. The reason for this is that these units of tone-vibration are coequal with twelve specific color-vibrations which are natural to our subconscious- ness because of the same pitch-ratio pertaining to both the measured colors and tones used in M ARCO- TONE. The colors are measured from the tone waves of each chromatic step of the once-accented octave. Color is the one and only mentally stable aspect of motion possessed by man, atavistically, whereby to measure speeds of vibration, i.e., we visualize color by an automatic measurement of vibration- speeds having for its source our subconsciousness. The result is consciousness of color."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"18  MARCOTONE M ARCOTONE is a science based on the exact rela- tionship between color and tone through number, and since no available medium except color-vibra- tion is natural to us for the exact measurement of pitch, M ARCOTONE should become an integral part of the routine wherever music is taught. Consciousness of tone, i.e., absolute pitch of the chromatic scale, as units (tones), or in combination (chords), should no more be restricted to the mu- sician’s calling (and alas, generally the musician has it not), than the natural and involuntary knowl- edge of color is now restricted to the painter’s art. Color is a universal attribute of the subconscious mind; the eternal possession of our mental faculties. It is necessary to all the arts and sciences whose source is vibratory action, and practically indis- pensable to Music. Through mastery of M ARCOTONE the human race can obtain the same free-will control of tone which it has atavistically over color. Once this new and vital factor in evolution is realized by those responsible for the nation’s educa- tion, we shall become a race of natural musicians. Song will become a common, everyday gift, even as speech is today; a new joy will have come into the hearts and minds of the people and a new and more harmonious epoch of life will fill the earth."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"ABSOLUTE PITCH  19 Recapitulation I . When he has subconsciously established the chromatic cycle of tone-color, viz: the twelve tone- colors of the natural or middle octave of light and sound, then the student automatically controls and utilizes these tone-colors as a permanent mental possession. II . The habit once formed of thinking the nota- tion’s dual value in tone and color of each step of the scale, gives the student a mental conception of these twelve units of vibration in the perfect manifestation of their activity as distinct units of measurement. III . The habit so formed becomes, in time, a spontaneous, natural and involuntary act of the mind. When this has been accomplished: ( a ) The attention will not be drawn to these exact speeds of motion as color (etheric waves). ( b ) The attention will not be drawn to these exact movements of vibration as tone (aerial waves). ( c ) The mental action is now automatic. To induce this subconscious power the following rules should be carefully observed: I . Contemplate each color separately until they can be evoked singly (as simple units); then practise them in combination as chords (compound units). II . Always think and repeat the name of the color of a note-sign, because color is the only natural subconscious power we possess which reveals the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"20  MARCOTONE exact movements of vibration or motion and thus permits us to obtain absolute pitch of tone as well as of color. III . Never try to think the tone of a note-sign, because it is unnatural to do so. We have no natural mental function which enables us to measure mo- lecular action as sound. IV . Use the Charts, Figures, Marcotonograph and other M ARCOTONE appliances, as first aids only when forming the habit of thinking the color-pitch of the chromatic scale of light. v. The mind must gradually be drawn from these first aids and come to rely more and more upon itself, within itself, i.e., the inner sanctuary of the mind must acquire the power to hold the color- thought in its possession without external aid and to create the tone which, by natural law, is correlated to the color-thought. VI . Owing to the great potentiality of words, a repetition of the name of the color is of great as- sistance in thinking color-pitch."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"TONE DEAFNESS  21 CHAPTER III TONE DEAFNESS AND ITS REMEDY It is possible to be a practical performer, a justly famous singer, a distinguished composer, and, at the same time, to be tone-deaf, i.e., unable mentally to register tonal-pitch. Most of us are born tone- deaf, and the majority of musicians, despite their erudition and artistry, are musical parrots to the end, victims of tone-deafness. Neither virtuosity of voice or instrument, nor the mastery of harmony, counterpoint, canon and fugue or any other of the allied musical sciences can give us tone-consciousness. M ARCOTONE is an exact science and the only one through which absolute tone-pitch can be mentally acquired. It builds into the human unit the natural basic powers of musicianship. The absence of abso- lute pitch is the basic flaw in the very principles of our art, the cause not only of bad musicianship, but of much unnatural labor on the part of all artists, for more than three-fourths of their time is given to learning the compositions of the tone-poets by rote! This entirely false attitude toward music enforces an altogether disproportionate amount of work upon the sense of touch (the feelings), and in consequence the nerve centers are strained, and therefore it is a common matter to find the artist a victim of “nerves.”"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"22   MARCOTONE To have absolute tone-pitch through M ARCOTONE is to have the power to read and hear understand- ingly any musical composition precisely as literary works are read and heard. Without it our ears may readily hear and we may enjoy a composition that we or others are interpret- ing; yet, except through the medium of mechanical appliances or the vocal expression of the tone, the tragic silence of the deaf mute is mentally ours. How can this unnecessarily absurd condition be changed? By placing in our subconscious mind the absolute pitch (as tone-color) of the chromatic scale. By so doing we become attuned to the cosmic or universal laws governing vibration or motion. This condition is natural musicianship. When one has become a natural musician, then is the allotted time to acquire the aesthetic complement which makes the artistic musician. Remember that in every branch of music the sense of touch and the nervous organism play a capital part. It cannot be too often repeated: ( a ) That certain classified colors and certain tones possess a co-equal ratio. (Those in the M ARCOTONE plates were measured from their musical proportions.) ( b ) That color is registered through the eye . ( c ) That tone is registered through the ear. ( d ) That color is received by the brain according to its just measurements as light-waves. ( e ) That tone is not received by the brain accord- ing to its just measurements as sound-waves."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"TONE DEAFNESS  23 (f) Yet given ratios of color can be correlated to given ratios of tone, because the color-thought can recreate itself in co-equal tone through the medium of the voice, twenty-nine or thirty octaves below. It was upon the foregoing principles that the tone- color system, M ARCOTONE, was made the funda- mental science of music, a science-art heretofore devoid of a natural foundation; a growth; as Helm- holtz says, from local and traditional aesthetics. M ARCOTONE has made it possible for all to sur- round themselves with the wonders of the world of tone, as hitherto they have enjoyed the world of color. This is especially significant now that a variety of mechanical means are bringing the best of music to our firesides. Who would not rather understand the message of the composer or artist through these excellent mechanical contrivances, and to read understandingly from the printed nota- tion whatever is played or sung, or to read it alone as we do a novel, play or poem, than merely to listen sensuously and thus barely catch the mere outline of the composition? The author has undeniable evidence from those who have mastered M ARCOTONE, that this sub- conscious power will not alone affect the musical proclivities of humanity, but will add immeasurably to the clairvoyance of scientists, painters, writers and poets, and to the vision of all who are engaged in the liberal arts and crafts devised by Man in his efforts toward a higher and nobler civilization."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"24   MARCOTONE CHAPTER IV THE MARCOTONE TONE-COLOR SCALE The Marcotone Scale is not to be understood as the chromatic form of the diatonic scale, but as a tone-color scale of twelve pitches within the distance of an octave. Number is the source of M ARCOTONE, and these numbers are found in the scale of harmonics. Harmonics, or upper-partials, are those overtones caused by the natural function of a fundamental tone dividing itself automatically into its aliquot parts. Starting, for example, with C in the “great octave,” the harmonics are all gov- Pitch 64 z erned by the number 64, because sixty-four added movements in air is Nature’s formula for expressing her harmonica1 scale with the great octave C or Do for fundamental.

The dotted lines above show how this arbitrary scale of the Greeks was built up as a spiral of fifths placed within an octave. Greek music, as understood by us, was introduced into Hellas by Pythagoras from Egypt. It belongs to the Hermetic philosophers of Osiris, Horus and Isis.

Mathemati- cally the twelfth (fifth within the octave) could be inverted and thus become the lowest note (4) of the four-stringed “lute of Apollo” or lyre of his son Orpheus. Remember that the music of the East is still homo- phonic (melodic), and this purely melodic music pre- vailed in ancient Egypt and therefore in Greece. As the “greater contains the lesser” the ancients, having gauged the interval once removed from the prime tone’s octave (g \" removed from c ' ), built their scale systems, the seven-toned scale within the distance of the ex- treme strings of the four-stringed lyre of Orpheus, viz: c; g; d; a; e; b; f, betweenf and c \" , and com- prised in their systems of double-tetrachords is c; d; e; f; g; a; b; c, the Lydian system. Yet this finely constructed scale is foreign to na- ture and the recent discovery of this fact has led “modern” music into strange places of adventure. The classical composers and, in a large measure, too, the romanticists of the middle nineteenth century, believed with the ancients that their diatonic scale was Nature’s own scale.

Now, these steps, although placed side by side and incorporated in each of the seven musical octaves, nevertheless are not of the same basic or primary value. The sonometer or monochord, plucked to obtain the C ' or do', causes this instru- ment for the measurement of musical sounds to emit 256 pulsations per second, or some acuter or denser sound having the same numerical ratio. But this plucked string of the monochord divided itself into its aliquot parts with the natural consequence that simultaneously its harmonics were heard. The sound obtained by plucking the string was, therefore, ob- tained objectively; but the overtone G or sol used for building the diatonic scale was automatically caused to sound by this same impact and consequently was obtained subjectively. Therefore the objective sound, C or do, is complemented by the subjective sound, G or sol. Tyndall, Gage and a number of other physicists in their acoustical experiments have dem- onstrated how sounds may be reduced to silence when a primary and its complementary tone are sounded simultaneously. This law equally applies to primary and complementary colors.

A perfect conception of the correlation of both these scales can be gained through a sub-division of the circle (360 degrees). This gives us the Chromatic Circle of Tone-Color. (See Standard Edition.) Not only do we thus obtain by natural law every- thing which, as sound, is used by the musical com- poser, the sum total of that which in combination gives us the whole fabric of the musical arts and sciences, but we are thereby enabled to equalize our imperfect diatonic scale. Examining this scale, we find it a mixed gamut of tones and half-tones. In sub-dividing it, chromatically, the diatonic scale be- comes a chromatic scale of twelve equal half-steps tempered for technical purposes.

Because the will has power to imprint on the mind a given color or series of colors, in M ARCOTONE it is necessary to practise any exercises given by a qualified teacher without any assistance from the tone-color charts or the figures in the book, i.e., mentally. These charts and figures are only first aids towards memorizing those colors which are in the same exact ratio of the vibrations as the tones and which are incorporated in the same musical sign. When power has been gained to recall these colors at will, then all assistance from the Marcotone Pitch-Pipe (the Marcotonograph*) and the colored diagrams must be discarded.

( b ) As twelve distinct Signs, for twelve distinct Tones. Each Note-Sign is made distinct from every other Note-Sign by the position it occupies on the staff. R ULES 1. The color of these twelve signs must be thought, i.e., realized by the mind, and not the tone. 2. When a given color is firmly held in the mind, this color is to be turned into its correlated tone by the pupil, that is, the pupil will sing it to the name of its correlated color. 3. These rules, 1 and 2, must be strictly observed, for the whole tone-color system depends upon the absolute law of motion or vibration governing M ARCOTONE. You can naturally think color without the assistance of the eye; but you cannot think tone with the assistance of the ear. Therefore, the color must be thought quite independently of its correlated tone, the pupil using the color-thought to establish the required tone. The higher octave"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"34 MARCOTONE automatically establishes the lower octave. (See Table and Chart, page 38.) 4. The tone-colors are to be practised by means of the Marcotone Charts and the various other specially invented means for perfecting the tone-color system. 5. Until the whole Tone-Color Scale of twelve chromatic steps is mastered only one new tone-color should be studied at the same lesson. The new tone- color can then be added to those already mastered. 6. Never associate a color with any tone except that tone to which it is correlated by natural law. To do so is to falsify the laws of Nature. This corre- lation is the foundation of the science of tone-color. (See Table and Chart, page 38.) 7. Remember, that having mastered the Natural or Middle octave (once-accented), the pupil’s ear will easily perceive these same color-tones when repeated in the lower or upper octaves, below or above the middle octave. The universal process of sound vibrations conforms to a fixed law which in actuality makes an octave circular. Each circle spirally repeats both the color and the tone. The only difference between these circles is that the vi- brations intensify, that is, become acuter as they become higher, but the ratio of tone and color never changes. 8. Never attempt to measure the interval between two tone-colors. Although this has hitherto been a common practice, the uselessness of trying to do so is patent from the fact that the human brain has no"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"TONE-COLOR  35 natural means whereby to measure distances between objects. 9. Before exercises are given the teacher must be absolutely sure that the pupil can readily think the colors of the notes contained in the exercises, and as readily translate each Color into its co-equal Tone. In the course of practice the effort of translating color into tone will become automatic. Then the student may begin reading the compositions of the master musicians. Finally it will be unnecessary to use the voice to obtain the tone, for both the tone and its correlated color will have become a part of the subconscious mind, and just as we can naturally call to mind a color or colors without the aid of the eye, so we shall then be able to call to the mind and hear “in our heads” a tone or tones without the aid of the ear. Then, just as we eat, walk, talk, read and write, we shall be able to read any music which we desire to study or to enjoy. When reading instrumental music, in which many notes are written outside the range of the human voice, the reasonable mind will realize the tone of all such notes in the once-accented octave, and the eye will show and the brain will grasp instanta- neously in which octave such notes lie. When the rules and explanations in this chapter are learned, then the pupil will have become a natural musician.

This order applies equally to all two-worded tone-colors. M ARCOTONE charts, plates, pitch-pipes, instru- ments of precision, toys and games are first aids only for teacher and pupil, to help, interest, and amuse. When M ARCOTONE is so far mastered that the twelve tone-colors, through the habit-forming method employed, become “second-nature,” and have built into the subconscious mind a faculty which automatically realizes tone in the same way that color is naturally apperceived by the mind, these means to that end will be entirely unnecessary.

This correlation of motion by ratio is a fixed law of Nature, discovered and applied through the law of Numbers, and mathematically applies to each step of the Tone-Color Scale.

YELLOW 45 CHAPTER VIII LESSON II. YELLOW The color-vibrations, which measured to the tone- vibrations, fixed to the musical note-sign in the once- accented octave, are co-equal and form the third primary tone-color Y ELLOW , shown in P LATE II. Yellow-Color as a light-wave and Yellow-Tone as a sound-wave are of the same ratio of pitch. This movement in “ether” causes our eyes to see Yellow- Color, and in air causes our ears to hear Yellow-Tone. Objectively, in all spheres of matter, as we have already explained, phenomena or sense-perception must be reduced to a question of motion.

When the Tone-Color Y ELLOW has become a permanent part of the mind, the teacher will write out several simple, rhythmical exercises.

BLUE The double note-sign, shown in P LATE III, which symbolizes the fifth primary Tone-Color in both the scales of Light and Sound, differs from the note- signs of the two former lessons because there are two notes, both of which symbolize the same prime Color and Tone. The first of these notes is the sign used in music, ascending the scale, and in keys with so-called sharp- sign (#) signatures. The second note is the sign used in music, descend- ing the scale, and in keys with so-called flat-sign (b) signatures. Although in musical notation these note-signs differ, the Tone-Color never alters. This change in the note-sign, but not in the Tone or Color-value, is called an enharmonic change. Therefore in visualizing these double note-signs, the enharmonic change must be remembered, so that whenever either of these notes has to be tonally realized, no misunderstanding will arise to confuse the student.

Looking at P LATE III, or, if you can do so, visualizing B LUE in the mind’s eye without help from the color, sing B LUE -tone. 6. Do not continue giving exercises with this lesson until the Tone-Color B LUE is permanently placed in your mind. The habit must first of all be cultivated until it has become second nature, so that the tone you ob- tain marcotonely is just as natural for you to think or sing, as it is for you by nature to realize mentally its correlated color. A few days, even weeks, may be necessary to accomplish this aim with each of the Twelve Tone-Colors. The inventor of M ARCOTONE and his pupils who have mastered it consider, generally speaking, that this system of acquiring tonal apperception requires nine months before music can be read, written, lis- tened to, and memorized with the same automatic facility that the average person gains over his or her own language. In common schools this will of course be a longer period. Undue haste is fatal to the study of M ARCOTONE .

Absolute Pitch is the power to call before the mind any tone,, alone or in combination with others, without the aid of any sense organ or mechanically adjusted musical instrument. The sense of touch has naught to do with it, unlike the control of relative pitch. Therefore Absolute Tone-Pitch is a possession of the subconscious mind, and can be obtained only through the hereditary power, possession of Absolute Color-Pitch. We can visualize Color subconsciously. We must hear Tone subconsciously by strictly fol- lowing the M ARCOTONE Rules.

Mental healing, auto- suggestion, osteopathy, clinical research, etc., are germinating these principles in the treatment of mental and physical sickness. The science of applied rhythmics (equilibrium) in Tone-Color vibration will finally banish the all too ready knife from our hos- pitals. Tone therapy will be applied universally in future human physical needs. What did Carlyle mean when he said that Thebes was built by the Music of Orpheus, quoting as he did from ancient literature? Simply that this city of unique and glorious pal- aces, tombs and temples was erected, like that most perfect specimen of all architecture, the Parthenon at Athens, upon an absolute system of Geometry evolved from musical proportions. (See Plato’s “Timaeus.“) The great Italian sculptor and architect of the fifteenth century, Leone Battista Alberti (1404- 1472), quoting from his Latin texts, wrote the fol- lowing edifying words: “A common thing with the ignorant is to despise what they do not understand. . . .

We shall there- fore borrow all our Rules for the finishing our propor- tions from the Musicians, who are the greatest masters of this sort of Numbers, and from those particular things wherein Nature shows herself most excellent and complete. . . .

Not as an individual sees them, but according to the uni- versal principle of Life, which is motion or vibration adjusted to the symmetrical, rhythmic proportions of Nature herself. This is Music, music in all things. The Science of M ARCOTONE, which is the agree- ment of Number correlated to Tone and Color, is a system within reach of every student, young or mature. The author of M ARCOTONE has followed the law of life governing his system, through Italy, Greece, and Egypt, to its source, deeply implanted in the cradle of the Aryan race, India. Wherever its universal expression has been practised he has found, its"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"MUSICAL PROPORTIONS 79 eternal principles always the same, and in M ARCO - TONE a systematized and modern exposition is given which many students have already mastered and now practise; a statement of the means by which the wisest in all ages and races have attuned the little universe of their own minds in harmony with the Uni- versa1 Mind of God, as He translates it in Nature. When M ARCOTONE has become a natural posses- sion, acquired through the common educational sys- tem of the people, a new epoch will have come. The characteristic feature of this epoch will be that the Divine Cosmical Idea will then be expressed as the practical work of human endeavor. Voltaire has said: “There must be something which produces our thoughts . . . it is Harmony.” But the worth-while thought which is produced by harmony is unattainable until the processes gen- erating Infinity proceed from the subconscious mind. We know that Color and Number are ours subcon- sciously through atavism. We know that Tone and Number are not ours sub- consciously; yet the universal principles upon which M ARCOTONE is founded will forever afford us this natural key to another and higher realm of the In- finite. By its practice and complete mastery, the trinity Tone-Color-Number will become a permanent possession of the real man - that inner, secret, sacred sanctuary of the mind, the Subconsciousness."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"80  MARCOTONE CHAPTER XX VIBRATION OR MOTION 1. Vibration or Motion is the source of cosmic manifestation and the principle of such universal powers as extension, space, figure and time. Therefore, when that cosmic principle is limited, its universality, which otherwise makes it incom- prehensible to mortals, can be understood, reason- ably studied and utilized. 2. Light is comprehended when the minute vibra- tions of ether come in contact with the organ of seeing, the eye. Sound is comprehended through the impact of atmospheric molecules upon the organ of hearing, the ear. It is the eye and ear, respectively, which receive the speeds of motion or vibration which we call light and sound; yet it is the brain which comprehensively registers them. The organs of sense are but the mechanical aids to deliver these speed messages to the intellect, and except for the vibratory powers of the brain they would remain unregistered. 3. Chemistry and mathematics prove that in prin- ciple the natural scales of light and sound are one; therefore, the colors of the solar spectrum and the tones of the musical scale have the same ratios of vibration. Hence both tone and color can be scaled"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"VIBRATION OR MOTION 81 so that a given number of light-waves (colors) will equal a given number of sound-waves (tones). 4. Because it is possible thus to correlate Color and Tone, mankind, through the exercise of this power, can become a race of natural musicians. 5. Music has become a part of our national system of education; therefore a scientific method is necessary to equip the student with the same automatic control of tone that all except those who are defective in color-sense (color-blind) now possess over color. 6. For ages, indeed from Man’s infancy, Nature has forced the color-scale on the human percep- tions. The savage is as susceptible to its influence as the civilized man; the only difference is in the aesthetic ability to apply color as a cultural factor in life. So long a period, reaching back to the dawn of Humanity, has passed in which color has been a dominant factor in evolution that, except in cases of color-blindness, everyone, savage and civilized, has an hereditary subconscious power to summon be- fore the mind at will a given color without the aid of the organ of sight. This power to memorize color in its variously defined pitches or degrees of motion is natural, involuntary and spontaneous. 7. The whole human race is tone-deaf except in the rare cases where relative pitch appears as an abnor- mal gift. The mind which automatically identifies color is incapable of recognizing subconsciously set speeds of vibration as tone."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"82  MARCOTONE 8. Why is this phenomenon so universally ap- parent? Because sound, except as mathematically treated by science or when mechanically obtained from musical instruments, has not been naturally forced upon mankind. Phenomenally Nature has produced only noise (absence of continuous melody or harmony according to musical proportions), and it has remained for science and art to produce isochronous or musical tone. These conditions have prevented the pitch of the tones of the natural scale of sound from producing the same phenomenon in the subconsciousness that color has succeeded in doing. 9. Before the advent of M ARCOTONE no means had been discovered by which Tone could be made a natural, spontaneous and involuntary act of the will, freed from sensual assistance: Even the senses generally fail to register the relative pitch of a com- bination of tones within the brain. Most of us, even professional musicians, depend entirely upon the aid of some sonorous instrument for an exact impression of the sound of a musical composition until it has been learned by rote, as the parrot learns to say “Pretty Poll!” Today more than three-fourths of the labor and fatigue of music study is due to the wasted effort of “learning” new music - and by rote! Do we “learn” to see a new painting? No; our automatic color sense enables us to see what is before us. It remains for the student of music so to correlate Color with Tone that he has the same automatic"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"VIBRATION OR MOTION 83 control over the natural scale of sound that he has over the scale of color. This will endow him with Abso- lute Pitch, the power to will a given tone before the mind without external aid. The function of M AR - COTONE is to give the student that power."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"84  MARCOTONE CHAPTER XXI MELODY ; VISUALIZATION; HARMONY M ELODY The student has learned that in order to read or memorize a melodic line understandingly at sight, he must previously have gained automatic control of the simple units of tonal-pitch. Such mastery of Melody can be obtained only in the complete absence of conscious effort. The process of reading music must be so natural that neither the color nor the tone engages the mind any more than conscious thought of tenses, cases and other elements of syntax enters into the process of reading words. It is equally obvious that there must be no resort to intervalically or harmonically induced formulae. From reading words we derive the sense of what has been written by a process which is involuntary and automatic. Not so with the old method of reading music. Why? Because in languages we work from within; whereas in music, almost invari- ably we call into play the cerebra-spinal apparatus involving the sense of touch, and shock our conclu- sions into the brain from without by the objective activities of the nerve centers. Any physician or psychiatrist will acknowledge such procedure to be unnatural, false and injurious."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"MELODY AND HARMONY 85 However, when we have gained automatic control over the natural scale of Tone-Color by means of M ARCOTONE , the power so derived can then be ap- plied directly to our general music studies, thereby raising the whole structure of musical art from the existing plane of erroneous routine to the zenith of subconscious attainment. We may now turn our attention to the practical method of developing these desired powers. R ULES FOR R EADING AND M EMORIZING M ELODY ( 1 ) Never employ any musical instrument except to test results in the early stages of study, and then only to sound that single tone of which you are uncertain. In M ARCOTONE all outside help is forbidden. (2) When, through study of tone-color, the apperception of pitch has been realized sufficiently to warrant our exploration in the rich fields of melody, the first effort will be to visualize a simple song, which should be a melodic line within the com- pass of the student’s voice. Note that we do not use the words read, memorize, but, instead, the term visualize. V ISUALIZATION In M ARCOTONE the word “visualize” is a sig- nificant word requiring careful explanation in con- nection with this rule. In the development of photography, the eye and the brain, with their nerve centers, have been used as models; and dark-chamber, exposure-trap, lens, etc., were contrived to catch the external object and permanently record its likeness within. These inventions in turn become useful in affording the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"86  MARCOTONE student a clear conception of the operations of the human eye and the definite results that can be ex- pected from that organ. Therefore, we use the term visualization in the sense of photography. In reading at sight and memorizing, the first step to be taken is to photograph the musical phrase so that it becomes a picture for the mental vision. To readily accomplish this, the following directions must be observed: (a) Avoid any suggestion of intervallic measuring. Expose to the camera of the eye at least one complete measure in which all the notes are comprehended simultaneously. As soon as this can be done without effort, treat a complete phrase in the same manner. Never regard a measure or phrase as a series of single notes; that would lead to rote reading, a mere parrot-like repetition of intervallic progressions. (b) The same relaxation which gave you the tone-color must in- variably attend all M ARCOTONE studies. Do not allow your- self to make or feel any effort whatever. That is, emotions have no place in the process of visualizing. It is only in the interpretation of what you have dispassionately marcotoned that the dynamic qualities of the art are brought into play. Then, having no artificial and arbitrary barriers to over- come, the fullest freedom of expression, the goal of all artistry, is within your grasp. (c) The measure or phrase must be calmly looked at, that is to say, exposed to the camera, for a time sufficient to mechan- ically photograph it on the brain. Note the word “me- chanically. ” No reasoning, suggestion, in fact, no thought whatever may be employed by the student. The mechanism only is used; the eye for lens; the nerve for conductor; the brain for dark-chamber; the eyelids for shutter. Thus a picture is obtained of our measure or phrase. Precisely that - nothing more, nothing less."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"MELODY AND HARMONY 87 ( d ) Give no thought to values of the notes, etc., which constitute your measure or phrase. When you believe you have photographed the unit under observation, close your eyes and see if the picture has been recorded in your \"mind’s eye. ” You will find it without effort if sufficient progress has been made; otherwise, return to the same measure or phrase and repeat the process until it has become visualized. ( e ) When you have so visualized the measure or phrase, put the music aside. If you are not absolutely sure you have a faithful copy of the music in your mind, write it down and verify it. If it is inaccurate, do not correct it from the music, but by a repetition of the photographic process. When you are sure you have the passage perfectly registered, you should proceed to sing it by the M ARCOTONE method you have been studying, as follows: (1) Think the color-value of each separate note; sing its correlated tone-value. (2) Sing the passage again without the aid of the color; i.e., sing each note, using its tone-color name only. (3) Sing the passage directly from the note-signs, without thought of color or tone values. In other words, sing the passage freely, without conscious effort to associ- ate tone, color, or tone-name. If the passage has been visualized successfully, i.e., photographed on the mind, the melody will come automatically and that passage will have been marcotoned. Then proceed with the meIody as before, in precisely the same methodical manner, measure by measure, or, better still, phrase by phrase (if the latter can be achieved without ef- fort ), until a complete musical period has become a possession of the mind, freed from the printed symbols. (f) It is important that, as each succeeding unit (measure or phrase, as the case may be) is perfectly visualized, the student should return to the first unit and repeat the entire passage; but each unit must be studied as independent of the rest until it is mastered. This procedure should be continued"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"88  MARCOTONE throughout the song until the whole can be sung freely and automatically from memory. (g) Then follows the committing of the words and finally your own interpretation of the meaning of author and composer, where the emotions are enlisted; and the student will find that the melody has passed so completely into the possession of his mind, that no thought of it will appear to divert him from the fullest artistic expression. Visualization, systematically realized, eventually becomes habit and the student finds himself able to read and memorize music at will, whatever his sur- roundings, as he would read a book. In studying the foregoing rules, bear constantly in mind that they are the outgrowth of the author’s long teaching experience and are now in successful use by beginners, as well as professional teachers and distinguished artists, and approved by eminent psychologists. S IGH T -R EADING Both memorizing and sight-reading depend on the possession of automatic absolute pitch. As this is a mental faculty, sight-reading becomes a simple matter of systematic mental adjustment, i.e., making a habit of doing automatically something which formerly we had the habit of doing by conscious cerebration. We have placed the subject of memo- rizing before that of sight-reading for the reason that once the functional control of tone in relation to memorizing is adjusted, the mind by the same ad- justment is enabled to achieve sight-reading. In"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"MELODY AND HARMONY 89 visualization we form the habit of automatically as- sociating note-signs with corresponding tones. The power to see a phrase of music photographed on the brain and at the same time subconsciously to hear the tones that we have the habit of associating with the symbols seen, naturally and logically, re- leases the power to comprehend at sight the tonal significance of the musical phrase, as you would read a line of poetry. But this power is not attained without study, and the following suggestions will be found helpful : (1) Always read a whole musical phrase, unless the student finds it requires effort to do so, in which case he may begin with a measure and follow the procedure prescribed for memorizing. (2) Read each phrase: (a) Thinking the colors correlated by the tone-symbols. (b) Singing tone-color names for the notes. (c) Singing the tones of the note-signs. (3) After the phrase has been sung without hesitation, verify its correctness on a musical instrument. If correction is needed, repeat the process described in Rule 2 2 for memorizing. (4) Continue as in memorizing until you have read the entire melody. Test it as a whole and if any part is found to be incorrectly read, return to that part and master it by the same process and independently of the rest of the song. HARMONY When the art of memorizing and sight-reading is mastered, the melodic line is followed by compound units of tonal-pitch, i.e., chord formation."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"90  MARCOTONE Chord forming is a vertical building of two or more tones instead of the horizontal movement of tones representing melody. H A R M 0 N Y MELODY Therefore, the eye, seeking to command an in- terior audition of the composer’s musical message, must adjust itself to a new form of written note- signs; but the tones will not be new, for their pitch, through number, is absolute. However, the rules and study prescribed for melody apply equally to the process of visualizing chords for both reading and memorizing, with the additions now to be stated. R ULES FOR R EADING AND M EMORIZING H ARMONY (1) (a) The notes forming a chord are always to be taken as one compound unit of pitch and are never to be con- sidered separately. (b) To verify the correctness of tonal-pitch, it is advisable to hum the tones of single chords (beginning with the lowest note and singing upwards in arpeggio form) not from the printed page, but from the visualized picture of the chord as a unit, vertical in form and not as a horizontal melodic line. (c) Each chord must be heard as one unit of tone. When tested by humming (b), the full chord should be realized"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"MELODY AND HARMONY 91 as a complete harmonic formation and this realization must automatically emerge from the visualization of the chord as a unit. The eye has now taken into its possession photo- graphica ll y a compound instead of a single figure, and the mind is required to comprehend and use units made up of a number of tone-colors instead of one. Proceed as in Melody by easy steps, test- ing progress with voice or piano by sounding the chord or succession of chords, from the visualized picture - never from the printed page. If di ffi culty is encountered in realizing the compound tonal value of a chord, use the actual visualization of the Tone-colors and if necessary revert to the early prac- tice of tone-color names. Thus mental visualization and hearing will become an automatic function. Remember, whenever a particular measure, phrase or chord gives trouble to take it up independently of the rest of the composition and master it separately. In other words, take it away from the rest and do not return it until it is right. (2) For the study of three-toned formations after the mastery of two-toned chords, it will be wise to observe the following suggestions : (a) Realize each three-toned chord formation by humming as prescribed in Rule 1 (b), but not each tone singly as before, since you will have become able to visualize and hear the two lower tones automatically. Therefore, you hum only the highest note of the chord with the result that you realize the chord-formation as a whole."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"MELODY AND HARMONY 93 Without the perfect functioning of the controlling mind the ear would be and forever remain tone- deaf, merely a conveyer of sensations from without to be intelligibly interpreted by the mind. There- fore, we train the mind to use the ear. As a last word on visualization we urge the student to remember that whatever the eye can convey to the brain through its photographic lens, the brain can realize automatically. When M ARCOTONE is mastered no more friction will exist between the composer’s message and the student than between the sending and receiving apparatus of wireless te- legraphy. Indeed, there should be less, since in the Science of Tone-Color only natural laws are invoked and the human and therefore uncertain element, inseparable from all man-made mechanism, disap- pears as soon as the exercise of M ARCOTONE princi- ples becomes automatic. Music is simply the artistic or happy expression of those mathematical laws which are God’s Creative Word, so that the naked truth of science becomes clothed in the immortal raiment of the beautiful in Art. Science can never directly advance the emo- tional and spiritual splendor of the mind; that is the divine function of philosophy and art. Yet these, without the foundation and environment of science, are insecure and incomplete. Combine them in the broad sense, and we have an influence that contrib- utes immeasurably to the glory and ecstacy of Life."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"94  MARCOTONE CHAPTER XXII HOW TO HEAR MUSIC; MUSICAL DIC- TATION; COMPOSITION The majority of people believe that to listen to music is to hear it. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Anyone who is not deaf can listen; few can hear! Why? Because man has not been gifted with a direct and special means to apperceive tone intuitively as he apperceives color. Therefore we become conscious of music through the mechanism of the ear only, a mere sense-perception in which the mind is not involved. The intellect may be con- cerned in individuals who have cultivated the purely intellectual significance of given compositions; but the actual picture in tone-color is not produced until the listener automatically realizes the inevitable association of musical notation with the twelve units of Pitch forming the Chromatic Scale of Sound. We have said that man has not been gifted naturally with this power. By this we do not mean that the power is not a natural one. It is essentially natural, but has heretofore remained undeveloped because the primitive sense-perception has been blindly held to constitute all there is to music. The first steps in Hearing and Writing music have been taken already by mastery of the Rules for Tone- Color Study. The inter-correlation of Tone and Color having been thus achieved and with it the"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"HOW TO HEAR MUSIC  95 ability to visualize a tone from without, the student may proceed to utilize that interior audition by writing down dictated music or music listened to, thereby perfecting his full consciousness of tone- values in association with notation. R ULES FOR D ICTATION (1) The teacher will play a short phrase, not more than two measures, three times, as follows: slowly; somewhat faster; in the tempo indicated by the composer. Let the pupil listen - but without any mental activity whatever, thoroughly relaxed. If the tone-colors function automatically, accord- ing to previous successful practice, the phrase so re- peated will readily be carried in the pupil’s memory. Whereupon three effects should be obtained simul- taneously : (a) The pupil will see the colors; (b) He will hear the tones; (c) He will visualize the notes. The pupil is then required to - (a) Say the color-names; (b) Sing the tone-pitches; (c) Write the note-signs. (2) These results having been achieved the teacher repeats the same phrase several times in correct tempo, and the pupil writes - (a) The key signature; (b) The tempo; (c) The whole melodic phrase with the length values of each note and rest."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"96 MARCOTONE (3) Repeat the process with several independent phrases until the pupil can do the work without effort. (4) When single melodic phrases can be written down exactly as composed, always phrase by phrase, the complete melody can then be dictated. Ulti- mately the pupil must be able correctly to reduce the melody to writing automatically and without effort. (5) When the dictated melody has been mastered, proceed in the same manner with passages in two, three and four parts and so on through all forms of composition, instrumental and vocal. But it must be understood that to command such competence in musical art, a patient progressive course must be followed. Undue haste retards, while a calm, thor- ough mastery of examples in the various stages of musical complexity insures an ultimate position on the splendid heights of artistry. Finally, care must be taken not to think we hear or imagine we feel the tones. We must already have built the faculty which recognizes without thought or feeling the absolute pitch of the twelve tones in which all music finds expression. C OMPOSITION The only real difficulty which confronts us in the adjustment of our artistic requirements is the adapta- tion of this automatic tonal functioning to musical composition.

When M ARCOTONE is mastered you have a scientifically and systematically in-built men- tal power, a newly added function of the mental faculties, which permits free play of your Will, the same liberty of consciousness that you possess in- herently in the world of Color. This is won by perfect coordination Physically: Of eye; ear; brain, which gives us apperception; Mentally: Color; Tone; Number, which enables us to realize all tone-combinations as naturally as we realize word- and color-combina- tions. It is not our purpose here to go deeply into the art of composition. That subject is exhaustively treated in the Standard Edition of M ARCOTONE ; but we will suggest a few simple means by which excel- lent habits may be acquired that will greatly assist the creative art. (1) Listen to Nature in all her various forms. Try always to coordinate the humming of insects, the singing of the birds, the soughing of the wind, the movement of water, the green of spring, the yellow and red of autumn and all of Nature’s color schemes, with the twelve tone-colors. See and hear these sights and sounds of Nature with your newly acquired M ARCOTONE powers which enable you to realize the actual tone-colors of these manifestations."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"98   MARCOTONE (2) Listen to Artifice, to man’s endeavor to concentrate Force effectively. Find and hear those tones single and compound emanating from engine, forge, hammer, loom, harvester, boiler. (3) Listen to Human Voices and to all sounds on earth and in the heavens that cause aerial movement. Correlate that move- ment to what you see and thus advance in realization of “etheric” motion in infinite forms. (4) At times write down in your music note-book what you see and hear, and try to correlate this within your own being. Such “listening-in” on Life’s activities will give you wisdom and make you a worthy interpreter of abstractions and emotions through music more surely than can be realized in any other domain of endeavor. (5) Finally, listen to the inner promptings, the “still small voice” of your own heart and soul. A few minutes daily, calmly consecrated to this practice, will be an unfailing source of education to the higher observance of the Eternal Law. When Harmony is established, Wisdom will enter. Some day, entirely your own day to choose, when Life’s, eternal music flows into a free stream of melodic-harmony, listen - and write down the message of Truth in Beauty which you then find residing in the depths of your being; then inscribe to your fellows a song of the Infinite. If the well- spring be pure, unchoked by the subtle error of Ignorance, the stream will be endless, for it flows from Unity, through Number, into that perfect Harmony, which is not a part of you, but is your wholeness of being; in rhythm; harmonized, and therefore one with the Unity by devout men called God."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"HOW TO HEAR MUSIC  99 0 we live, 0 we live - And this life that we conceive Is a clear thing and a fair, Which we set in crystal air, That its beauty may be plain: With a breathing and a flooding Of the heaven-life on the whole, While we hear the forests budding To the music of the soul - Yet is it tuned in vain? - E LIZABETH B ARRETT B ROWNING ."}]
