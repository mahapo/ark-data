An \"amateur \" Egyptologist (as the scholars must have labeled Schwaller de Lub icz) had presented an entirely new and radical approach for the considera- tion of Egyptologists, archaeologists, and historia ns in general, an approach that might have been ignored completely ha d it not been developed with such a great amount of forceful, det ailed research, and had it not won over the complete acceptance and enthusiasm of several of the leading Egyptologists and archaeo logists of that time, including Alexandre Varille and C.H. Robichon . We shall not go into the intriguing way in which the academic es tablishment cir- cumvented a confrontation with the challenge posed by Le Temple dans l'Homme; nor shall we examine how they attempt ed to dismiss this work through the well-known academic tactic of intentional silence. Instead, let us use these few pages to int roduce this rela- tively little known author, then to see what might be some of the major themes contained in the \"New Egyptology\" that Schwaller de Lubicz's work opens before us. It is true that Schwaller de Lubicz was not a quali fied Egyp- tologist by academic standards. Instead of first sp ending years in the Egyptological libraries of Europe, he, upon his first visit to Egypt, took up residence together with his family 1 in a small hotel 1 His wife, Isha Schwaller de Lubicz, a specialist i n Egyptian hieroglyphic language, later wrote a two-volume novel depicting life in ancient Egypt th rough the eyes of a young man who attains the level of temple initiation.

Schwaller de Lubicz was already a mature man by the time he arrived in Egypt. Let us therefore review briefly h is earlier years. 2 At about eighteen years of age. Rene Schwaller left his home in Alsace, after having completed an apprenticeship wi th his father in pharmaceutical chemistry, and went to Paris with th e clearly formulated intention of \"learning the true nature o f substance.\" In addition to studying modern chemistry and physics, at this young age he began reading every alchemical text he could find, those of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries as well as sixteenth-century Rosicrucian texts and the more familiar works of Pa racelsus and Raymond Lull. For a period he became interested in painting and was a student of Matisse, but his main role among h is contem- poraries was that of a philosopher of nature; thus, he influenced many artists in Paris at that time, such as Arp, Le ger, and especially Prince O.V. de Lubicz Milosz, the Lithua nian mystic poet and statesman, who in 1919 conferred his famil y title on Schwaller as a means of expressing his admiration a nd gratitude. He served in the armed forces as a chemist during t he First World War, and at the close of the war he published a journal, L'Affranchi, followed by Le Veilleur, both dedicate d to social reform in the difficult task of implementing peace. During the course of his personal development, he r eceived the name of \"Aor,\" signifying \"Light of the Higher Mind .\" He is said to have continued his alchemical research during th is period, and later, while living among and guiding a contemplati ve community of students, scholars, artists, and craftsmen who h ad gathered around him at. St. Moritz in the Swiss Alps, he pro duced alchemical glass with reds and blues thought to com pare with the stained glass of Chartres Cathedral, a feat no othe r chemist has been able to accomplish in the six hundred years si nce the cathedrals were constructed. It was during the year s at St. Moritz that his philosophic and scientific vision coalesce d around an understanding of the universal laws of harmony. 2 For a more complete biographical account, see AOR, Sa vie, Son oeuvre by Isha Schwaller de Lubicz (Paris: La Colombe, 1963), and Serpent in the Sky: A Study of the Work of Schwaller de Lubicz by J.

West (New York: Harper & Row, 1978). 8"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Thus, it might be said that Schwaller de Lubicz's p reparation for Egypt was that of a philosopher, in the sense that his entire life constituted an intense philosophical inquiry. His u nique and intuitive way of seeing, in combination with a tech nical and scien- tific education, gave him his extraordinary insight into the values and objectives motivating ancient science and theol ogy. In Schwaller de Lubicz's scrupulous examination of the an and architecture of the Temple of Luxor, at least two c oncurrent levels are being developed at any given point. One is the study of Egypt as a civilization that existed in a factual geograp hic place and time (including its people, mythology, social forms, its chronological unfolding, its monuments and artifacts), but this l evel is only a backdrop, or support, for another Egypt which might be defined as a \"quality of intelligence.\" This is Egypt as an ev ocation of a par- ticular utilization and expression of a universal p ower of higher intellection. This Egypt is outside of chronologica l considerations; it is, rather, both an ever present and a recurring po ssibility of con- sciousness. In his approach to Egypt, Schwaller de Lubicz stresses the view that in order to comprehend the significan ce of a heightened phase among man's varied historical expr essions, we need to impose on ourselves the discipline of attem pting to enter into the mentality of the people and the spirit of the time. To do so would mean more than just learning the language and symbols of the period under study; we must also awaken in ours elves a living inner rapport with the material being researched an d identify with it in a potentially self-transforming manner. Of co urse, this ideal can never be fully attained, as our present conscio usness is inevitably with us, but, on the other hand, by cont inuing to sift all of history through our present rationalized, indivi dualized psy- chological mentality, we distort beyond recognition the content and meaning of the past. This distortion often occurs w hen we try to interpret the great mythological cultures of Egypt or Vedic India in particular; we tend to lose sight of the fact that these cultures were expressing a different mentality, and values, from ours and that they had a completely different understanding of th e goal and pur- pose of life. As a result, in all of their science, art, and knowledge these cultures used distinct modes and methods of s ymbolization. Schwaller de Lubicz found it necessary to inquire i nto the nature of 9"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"symbolization i t s e l f in order even to arrive at an understanding of what a heiroglyph is. This he carried out in two sm all books, Propos sur Esoterisme el Symbole (Esotericism and Symbol) and Symbole et Symbolique (The Symbol and the Symbolic), English t ranslations of which are forthcoming from Autumn Press. That these ancient peoples thought differently than we do—and that we must understand this difference if we are t o study them properly—seems obvious, but an example will show ho w difficult it is to put this idea into practice. Schwaller de Lub icz explains in Le Temple de l'Homme (Caracteres, 1957) that in the an cient temple civilization of Egypt, numbers, our most ancient fo rm of symbol, did not simply designate quantities but instead wer e considered to be concrete definitions of energetic formative prin ciples of nature. The Egyptians called these energetic principles Net ers, a word which is conventionally rendered as \"gods.\" \"In considering the esoteric meaning of Number, we must avoid the following mistake: Two is not One and One ; it is not a composite. It is the multiplying Work; it is the notion of the plus in relation to the minus; it i s a new Unity; it is sexuality; it is the origin of Nature. Physis, the Neter Two. It is the Culmination (the separating mo ment of the full moon, for example); it is the line, the stick, movement, the way, Wotan, Odin, the Meter Thoth, Me r- cury, Spirit.\" Also, when the ancients considered the process of m athematical multiplication, their mode of calculation had a dir ect relationship with natural life processes as well as metaphysical ones. Schwaller de Lubicz called this mode the \"principle of the cr ossing\" (interest- ingly, we today continue to symbolize multiplicatio n with the sign of a cross: X). This crossing was not a sterile, mental, numerical manip- ulation but a symbol for the process by which thi ngs enter into corporeal existence. All birth into nature requires a crossing of oppo- sites. It can be the crossing of vertical and horiz ontal lines, which give birth to the square, the first measurable surface; or male and female, giving birth to a new individual; or warp and weft, creating a fabric; or light, and darkness, giving birth to tangible fo rms; or matter and spirit, giving birth to life itself. Thus the vital linking up of the mental abstraction of calculation with it s counterpart in natural phenomena gave the ancient mathematician a living and philoso phic basis for his science. 10"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Similarly, these ancienl peoples did not use words as we do, that is, as symbols or sounds linked together, which hav e fixed, memorized associations and which we compose in sequ ential patterns within the mind. For them words were of a musical nature; or, more precisely, speaking was a process of generating sonar fields establishing an immediate vibratory id entity with the essential principle that underlies any object or fo rm. The pharaonic intelligence that Schwaller de Lubicz reveals to us was not the visualizing, analytical mentality we know but a son ar-intuitional mode. In the Egyptian temple, wrote Caspar Maspero, the human voice is the instrument par excellence of the priest and the enchanter. It is the voice which see ks afar the Invisibles summoned and makes the necessary obj ects into a reality. . . . But as every one (of the ton es) has its particular force, great care must be taken not to c hange their order or to substitute one for the other. 3 Clearly, this approach to Egyptology dema nds a qualitative change on our part if we are to enter into the phar aonic spirit. And this change in our thinking may offer us perspectiv e not only on the vastly different intelligence of the past but on th e limitations and excesses of our present intellect as well. This meticulous meditation on the stones and statua ry of Luxor also raises far-reaching questions on the function and nature of history itself. In particular we begin to see that Egypt may have left us some essential keys to help us find our way towa rd an integra- tion of things metaphysical (spirit), mathematical (mental, scien- tific), musical (vibrational, living) and physiolog ical (physical or material). As a civilization, Egypt certainly holds up to us a model of this reintegrated expression of the various plan es and parts of our individual natures and of the cosmic life of ou r universe, and thus may prove of greater value in the spiritual cr isis now con- fronting us than the religions of transcendence ada pted from various ancient Eastern cultures. Egypt was not of the lineage that advocates transcendence and denial of material exis tence; it taught, rather, transformation. The ancient name for Egypt was \"Kemi,\" meaning \"Black Earth,\" the field of vital transform ation; the Arabs, Schwaller de Lubicz points out, called E gypt \"Al-Kemi.\" 3 As quoted in Henry George Farmer, \"The Music of Anc ient Egypt,\" The New Oxford History of Music (London, Oxford University Press, 1957) p. 259. 1 1"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Thus we find in its very name that age-old, univers al doctrine so often disguised in symbols and parables. This doctr ine encompasses a vision of the principle of matter as a field of e xistence responsive to and capable of being transformed by spiritual in fluences brought about through the evolution of embodied and individ ualized con- sciousness. The West today could benefit from a phi losophy of spiritual depth that does not suppress, diminish, o r deny our intel- lectual and material nature but rather fulfills our commitment, to the meaningfulness of human life and this material expression of the universe. This lost alchemy, the pursuit, of which extends ba ck to its flow- ering in ancient Egypt, can be seen as the hidden e soteric roots of both civilization and individuals throughout record ed time. It is this same alchemy which is at the core of the vision of the anthropocosm—of Man as being and containing within himself the entire universe. This vision, which is introduced b y Schwaller de Lubicz in these pages and expanded and brought to l ife in his major work, The Temple of Man, leaves us with a sin gle, enduring message: the inevitable resurrection of the spiritu al essence which has involved i t s e l f in matter in the form of organi c creative energy. This resurrection depends upon the transformation o f the material universe—or to express the idea more as Egypt left it imprinted in the stones of Luxor: the birth of divine man (symbo lized by the pharaoh) depends upon the transformation of the uni versal mother (materia prima). This transformation was considered the sole cosmic goal. Every human birth participates in this alchem y, either in an awakened manner through the intentional perfecting and expres- sion of one's higher nature, or unawakened, through the tumult and suffering of karmic experience leading eventual ly to a spiritual self-awareness, the temple in man. The intensificat ion and height- ening of human consciousness was believed to cause biological and even cellular changes in the physical body of the i nitiate. This divinization of the individual body, on the microco smic level, com- prised the goal and purpose of the evolution of hum an conscious- ness in general. Within the Temple of Egypt, psycho-spiritual growth was wed- ded to precise intellectual and physiological disci plines which acted to accelerate the influence and transformativ e effects of spirit 12"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"over matter. With Egyptian alchemy we arc consideri ng, then, a science in the highest sense of the word, and one v ery different from our own. It was science directed toward the embodim ent of spiritual knowledge, toward the internalization and corporeal expression of intellectual and spiritual powers, ra ther than the mechanistic utilization of knowledge-power for the exploitation and manipulation of the earthly environment. The Temple was the pinnacle of the collective life, ever guiding the energy of the long-lived civilization of the Ni le Valley toward the gestation of a divine humanity out of the trans itory human form. ROBERT LAWLOR 13"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Preface T HE PURPOSE of this book is to present indisputable evidence that a symbolic directive was operative in the architect ure of the Temple of Luxor. I will examine esoteric symbolism and its significa nce in ancient Egypt in greater depth in a future book, the outlin e for which can already be established on the basis of a wealth of. documentation. This material now allows us to affirm that what is true for the Temple of Luxor is also true for other monuments fr om all the Egyptian dynasties, the symbolism evidently having been adapted to the particular consecration of an edifice and to the nature of the place where it was erected. The findings presented here are the fruit of eight years of unin- terrupted work carried out by Lucie Lamy, consistin g of very precise surveys of the present layout and the bas-r eliefs of the Tem- ple of Luxor, and the notation of the measurements. Clement Robichon, architect and head of field work operatio ns of the French Institute of Oriental Archaeology, was responsible for triangulation and for checking all the plans. Triangulation was carried out by means of a Saharan -type Morin Tacheometer with a 14-centimeter base plate. Understandably, I feel moved, at the beginning of t his work, to thank Egypt warmly for the hospitality it has shown me. In addi- tion, the Department of Antiquities has been very h elpful and understanding throughout. For a history of the excavations of the Temple of L uxor, the reader is referred to G. Daressy's \"Notice Explicat ive des Ruines du Temple de Luxor\" published in 1893. A study of detail is required almost uniformly. For this reason, 14"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"we have established a new method of surveying by me ans of mak- ing precise drawings, with an exact notation of the outlines of the tableaux (the various \"registers\" or strata of imag es found on the walls of Egyptian monuments) the figures, and their main acces- sories.

Each drawing of an entire section, once recorded on microfilm, can be projected, thus enabling the exact correlati on of separately drawn or carefully photographed texts or figure det ails with the whole. Applying this method, a trained team of five or six people, guided by the principles I shall set forth in this book, could survey the architecture and decoration of a temple such as that of Euxor in six months—a task that took us eight years. 15"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Introduction EXCAVATIONS and philological studies supply the Egyptologist with abundant material for a knowledge of (he life, beliefs, and theology of ancient Egypt. An encyclopaedic amount of work is available to the researcher. Nevertheless, Pharaoni c Egypt remains unknown in terms of its true science, i t s contingen t psycho-spiritual knowledge, and its philosophical mentality. The funerary texts develop t h e myth transcribed int o images, but it has not been possible to translate the deeper me aning of these images into comprehensible language. The philosophi cal connection of the accumulated data is lacking. One tends to se ek in ancient Egypt, as well as in Babylon and other traditions o f the past, what might be called a rational expression of esotericis m. This is an error that arises from the prejudice that there is no esotericism, or that there exists an intent to conceal a certain kn owledge. However, simple reasoning shows us that, for exampl e, if the Gospels were written to teach the way of Truth and to show us what this Truth consists of. then the form of parab les and enig- matic phrases chosen for this revelation would be n onsensical if its purpose were to conceal this Truth. The purpose of these parables and enigmatical phrases is not to hide anything fro m \"he who has eyes to see and ears to hear,\" according to the eva ngelical formula. The purpose is to select those who developed the ne cessary under- standing and who are for this reason worthy of thes e \"secrets\" (that is to say. they will not misuse them for self ish motives). There was never any intent to conceal, from those thus pr epared, any of the wisdom transmitted by texts, traditions, or mon uments. The enigma does not lie in the thing itself but is the result of our under- standing, our faculties, and our intelligence, whic h arc not attuned 16"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"to the mentality according to which the idea was ex pressed, and it is just this that our present education prevents us from admitting. However, there is a type of education that—using th e vital organs in which the nervous flux is transformed as well as the centers (or \"nodes\") of this flux—can awaken \"consc iousness\" of states that precede and transcend material forms. T he West has no terminology for this science, and thus we must have recourse to the oriental languages. But the words alone are useless without the concepts. Ancient Egypt is in fact one of the major sources of these sciences: however, a true vocabulary of the Pharaon ic language—or even a provisional one—will never be possible unles s attention is given to those questions which we define as psycho- spiritual. The Egyptian symbolism can guide us in t h i s regard and show us mean- ings other than the common meanings currently accep ted for a great many words. In this way. the meaning of many texts will become clear. Rationalism is based on the data provided by the se nses, and the senses perceive only a meager part of what is. Thus , through rationalism alone we can know only what is encounte red through the senses, what is ponderable, quantitative. Yet m athematics have demonstrated the existence of elements that fall ou tside the physical; we must take this into account, and if ra tionalism brings us up against an impenetrable wall, in so doing it in fact teaches us that it has its limits and that we should seek anot her means of knowledge. We express ourselves in a conventional language, an d the dic- tionary defines and limits the meaning of each word . Therefore, we can understand nothing beyond what the dictionary k nows. We write with conventional alphabetic signs that in th emselves express only sounds; thus our alphabet is merely a mechanic al means for composing the words in the dictionary and transmitt ing the thoughts they encompass. It may be said that the co mbinations of these letters are almost infinite: true, but the nu mber of words is limited by notions already acquired. Thought can al so examine observed phenomena and seek the causes. . . . Certa inly it can, but as soon as it approaches the metaphysical, it can n o longer find in our languages and forms of writing the means of exp ressing itself: abstract ideas, formulated in words for which we la ck the concepts, are objectified and lose their significance. 17"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"It follows from these observations that either ther e exists only a concrete world perceptible to the senses, or we lac k a faculty that would enable us to grasp the abstract, without havi ng to concretize through the imagination. The process is ingrained i n us, in accor- dance with a mode that always leads toward the quan titative definition. This is the inverse of the Egyptian men tality. If an unknown phenomenon appears, it is already the concreti- zation of a cause that was abstract for us. Instead of searching out the nature of this cause, we obey our reductionist tendency and restrict both cause and phenomenon to the realm of the mechanical mentality. We investigate nothing deeply; we pull e verything down to our own limits. However, a simple image proves t o us that there is a way we can express ourselves without limiting a notion to a defined form, and transcribe our thought without im posing our own mentality on those who will read this image. We hav e gotten into the habit of reducing everything in Time and Space: this is the rational habit. An image, on the other hand, gives access to a world of qualities and functions. For instance, if we say \"a man walks,'' we see a man walking, but we sec him in a limited w ay: we imagine only the fact of moving or walking. We can then pla ce that fact in the past, present, or future and all the gradations of these tenses: we situate this movement in Time and Space. If, on the other hand, we see an image that represents a man walking (or s imply lines depicting a man) we no longer imagine him, we no lo nger situate him; he is there, it is the function that interests us, and the quality of that function. We can then paint this man green: it will no longer be solely the function of walking with one's legs that is evoked—this movement could also signify vegetation or growth. But to our reason, walking and growing are two differen t functions, while in reality there is an abstract connection be tween them: it is movement outside consideration of Time, or pathway, or specific direction. If we wish to define this movement, we immediately reduce it in Time and Space, whereas there is no further need to define the feel- ing of motion (whether walking or growing); the ima ge—the symbol—acts as definition, and we can in fact exper ience this con- dition (unconsciously become one with it, without a ny reasoning) just as any child would looking at pictures. 18"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Thus, the representation—the symbol—is our only tru e means of transmitting an esoteric meaning, which, in alphabe tic writing, we have to seek in parable, or, possibly metaphor or a llegory. The Chinese mentality is characteristic of this transcr ibed symbolic mentality: the idea is circumscribed but not named. Something of this mentality, which we encounter in the Egypt of the pharaohs, has remained among the peoples of the Middle East: the indirect question and answer. Symbolic representation and imagistic writing are t he pure hieratic forms of esoteric expression. Through symb olism, and through it alone can we read the thought of the Anc ients. It is only through the symbolical that we will be able to coor dinate the known elements of this great civilization and that the writing may take on its true meaning. With regard to this mode of expression, I shall quo te Ampere, Essai sur la Philosophic des Sciences (vol. 2, pp. 103-104): \"These rites, these dogmas, often conceal ideas onc e reserved for a small number of initiates: and the s ecret of these ideas, though buried with them, can be redis- covered by those who study in depth all the types o f teachings remaining of the ancient beliefs and the ceremonies they prescribed. Hence, a science, given the name of 'the Symbolic' (the name I shall retain for it), proposes to uncover what was hidden behind such div erse emblems.\" I shall explain more precisely what I mean by the w ord symbol in the chapter on \"Definitions\" and in the \"Summary of Principles.\" We also see in the symbol the only means of making a connec- tion between the \"oriental\" mentality and the \"occi dental\" men- tality, according to the basic distinction currentl y accepted. But pharaonic Egypt—which is, in my opinion, the main s ource of Mediterranean civilization—is in some ways closer t o us than is the Orient. Its mentality is positive, and its expressi on is symbolic, to con- vey a form of esotericism that does not differ from the others, since Wisdom cannot vary if it is real. This symbolic aspect has been completely neglected in Egyp- tology. It is the proof of its existence, and of th e directive stemming from it in the pharaonic expression, that I find an d present with the Temple of Luxor. 19"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The strangely irregular plan of this temple prompte d me to investigate the causes of these irregularities. Sin ce this architec- tural conception was executed in several phases alo ng the temple's longitudinal axis, hitherto the simple explanation of attributing utilitarian purposes to successive builders has bee n adopted. In my opinion, only more profound reasons could have insp ired these extraordinary constructions, which certainly, on ac count of the very effort required, could not have been consecrated to inconsequential ideas. Many positive proofs and experiments now con firm the correctness of this way of thinking. Obviously, no one would build such monuments, and i n such great numbers, over thousands of years, for unculti vated peasants. This work is of necessity that of an e l i t e , and, ev en more remark- ably, an elite that never ceased to renew itself, a n elite that seems to have been uniquely endowed with a wealth of scie ntific knowl- edge, including an understanding of the laws of Lif e. What, then, was this inexhaustible source, and what means so powerful and so stable assured such continuity? We are dealing here, not with an evolution of scien ce, but rather, on the contrary, with an immutable basis: for the e xistence of a language and a form of writing that were already co mplete from the time of the earliest dynasties of the historica l period seems to confirm this. What we sec is not the beginnings of research, but the application of a Knowledge already possessed. * First of all, our team set out to survey the genera l plan of the temple, then all its details with the greatest prec ision possible without concerning ourselves with an explanation of the 1,001 irregularities observed. I shall explain the outcom e of this work in the following pages. The first important thing, affording the true expla nation of all the idiosyncrasies, was the discovery of axes drawn on the platform of the covered temple. Aside from the axes drawn on the ground in the sanctuary of the barque, it was of course indis pensable to have an original median axis, on which an initial genera l plan could be 20"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"based. This axis is marked under the platform, and at any rate it is obvious. The study of these axes shows that each correspond to a pur- pose: each axis is a theme that rules the direction of the construc- tions related to it. In fact, each wall was built i n relation to one or another of these three axes, with no regard for the obvious disorder that could ensue. Thus we have here a discovery tha t is extremely important for studying the architecture of the temp les and for deciphering the meaning of the pictures and texts t raced on their walls. We are dealing here with an orientation that is spatial as well as ideological. This concerns the architectural basis, which happen s to be indissolubly linked with the governing idea express ed in the dedica- tion of this temple. We then looked for what could be the charac- teristic symbol of this consecration, a symbol that should conform to the dedication. We began by finding it in the strange paving of the covered tem- ple. This paving in fact makes no sense if it does not have a pur- pose. The paving stones—none of which is cut in a c urve—are sometimes placed to give the effect of curves: thei r apparent dis- order curiously resembles a Byzantine mosaic from w hich the colors have been removed. They contain several shapes that attract the attention: for instance, the curve of an eye outlin ed by large blocks; the shape of an ear, as well as the channel of the trachea, outlined by a series of juxtaposed slabs. We find in room 20 a bas-relief representing the same face as that formed by the el ements of the paving. Obviously, this would not afford a definite conclusion; but the canon proportions of the profile and the head, and of the head in relation to the body, are present. Here the Gold en Number comes to our aid. It controls all vegetable and ani mal growth. The following pages arc based on these explanations. The outline of a human skeleton—traced according to anthropo- metrical methods and very carefully constructed, bo ne by bone— was superimposed on the general plan of the temple. The head (full face for the skeleton) is located exactly in the sa nctuaries of the covered temple; the sanctuary of the barque of Amun is in the oral cavity; the clavicles are marked by walls; the ches t is located in the first hypostyle of the covered temple and ends w ith the temple's 21"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Fig. 1.

The abdomen is represented by the peristy le court, and the pubis is located exactly at the door separating this peristyle from the colonnade of Amun. This marvelous colonnad e is, in fact, dedicated to the femurs, the thighs; t h e knees are at the site of the gate in front of which sit the two colossi, marking the entrance to this colonnade. The tibias are in the court of Rams es, framed by the colossi, whose legs (tibias) are particularly p ronounced. The lit- tle toe of our skeleton falls exactly at the northw est angle of the pylon. One might be tempted to think this skeleton had been con- structed to be superimposed on the temple. But any skeleton, as long as it is harmonious (like the one represented here) can be pro- jected thus on the plan of the temple and will coin cide with it. Moreover, all the proportions of the skeleton may b e checked against the actual measurements of the temple. For my report, it was necessary to have recourse to the Egyptian canon; I have in this regard devoted a chapter to a subject that has never been dealt with until now—the importance the Ancients accorded the crown of the skull (cava). This crown of the skull, marked off in Egyptian fig uration by a headband, a diadem, a headdress or crown—is a verit able revela- tion with regard to psycho-spiritual knowledge of t he Ancients. This is made clear by the placement of the principa l organs of the Intellect and of all the control mechanisms of life in the various sanctuaries, whose figurations, texts, and architec ture specify their purpose. The Temple of Luxor is indisputably devoted to the Human Microcosm. This consecration is not merely a simple attribution: the entire temple becomes a book explaining the sec ret functions of the organs and nerve centers. I have had to limit m yself here solely to demonstrating the symbolism that directs the tem ple's architec- ture, without entering into a study of this magnifi cent, book: my aim is to draw the attention of those who are inter ested and to place archaeologists on the alert. If it were to ad opt this point of view, Egyptology would no longer be a sterile scien ce. I have inserted a chapter giving the general ideas of a philosophy of Measures—not that they enter in as a proof of sy mbolism, but because it is Measure that enabled me to discover t he method of applying the symbolic. It is also the purpose of th is explanation to 24"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"indicate the mentality of the Master Builders and t he ancient Egyp- tians in general. This study of Measures has also s hown us evidence of their astronomical science (I have nume rous proofs of this and shall have occasion to discuss it at great er length else- where) as well as their undeniable knowledge of geo desy. If, in my report, each chapter is presented as an i sland connected to the others only by a governing line of thought, this too corres- ponds to the pharaonic mentality. The subject under discussion is so vast that I had the choice of writing a lengthy book—which would have greatly del ayed publication—or a very concise outline rendered inte lligible by com- plementary figures and diagrams. All the data relating to my thesis have been checke d rigorously and may be verified at the site. The mentality that directs me—that I attempt to con vey—will of course be opposed by the rationalism that dominates modern thought. I am concerned with discovering the though t of the ancients, and I feel that in the investigation of C auses there are three possible ways: rationalism, framed and limite d by matter; pure faith, which is a perfect way. as long as this faith is absolute and all philosophical speculation is eliminated; an d third, the philosophical way, but this leads nowhere unless th e means employed are adapted to the goal. These are the mea ns that ancient Egypt teaches us through i t s mentality and symbolism. To conclude, I shall again draw Egyptologists atten tion to the two methods of inscription that. I call transpositi on and transparency. These constitute a new and very important key for t he study of texts and figurations. It is necessary to note that there is, in trans- position and transparency, no intent to conceal a t eaching; on the contrary, their purpose is to explain vital functio ns symbolically. Thus a naos (a proportional and decorated shrine in tended to hold a sacred object), a barque (a god's ceremonial boat ), a linen chest are not simply cult items or objects for daily use; they also repre- sent organs and functions of life, man being taken as the summa- tion of all the possibilities immanent in the Unive rse, However, the Egyptians apparently considered the organs of the h uman body— images of the divine universal organism—too sacred to be used directly as symbols; for the types most specificall y representative of 25"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"the development of the organs were chosen from amon g the animal and vegetable kingdoms.

The terms \"cerebral consciousness\" and \"'cerebral i ntelligence\" plus the adjective \"vital\"—defining vital function, vital logic, etc.— are used in a special new sense. * CONSCIOUSNESS—If a Cause-Origin of the Universe is admitted, it is of necessity unique. However, if reason imposes on us the idea of an indivisible, i.e.. quantity-less, unity, the ide a of this unity eludes our point of view as creatures forming part of this Universe, a con- sequence of the unique Cause. This unity exists for us only if comparison is poss ible; but com- parison signifies consciousness and duality. Thus, creation is accomplished entirely between the numbers One and T wo; and duality is the basic characteristic of the created Universe. This duality is the principle of sexuality. Duality impl ies comparison with a series of phenomena which produce cerebral c onsciousness. Unity creates by \"looking at itself\"; it is the fal len angel of the Judeo-Christian tradition and also the Adamic error in the Genesis of Moses. We may call this Unity God or Unpolarized Energy, in that this Unity is indivisible, and God, the Creato r or Polarized Energy, insofar as it is Unity conscious of itself. Therefore, the Universe is only consciousness and p resents only an evolution of consciousness, from beginning to end, which is the return 27"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"to iis Cause. 1 The aim of every \"initiatory\" religion is to teach the way that leads to this the ultimate merging. Cerebral consciousness, which is peculiar to the an imal kingdom and the human animal, requires the faculty of regis tering notions that are only acts of comparison, and this faculty is located in the cerebral cortex and the double cerebral lobes. On the other hand, understanding—Intellect or Reaso n 2 —is the faculty of synthesis in the coordination of ideas a nd is functionally- centered in the pituitary and pineal bodies (hypoph ysis and epiphysis). This is what the ancients called the \"i ntelligence of the heart,\" because its impulse is manifested through t he solar plexus (the sympathetic nerve), the emotive center, and it s direct physical reactions upon the heart. LIFE—Various definitions have been given for the te rm \"life,\" the best of which seems to me to be \"the faculty of ass imilating a food and transmuting it in the nature of the living bein g.\" Any ger- minating seed—or any seed capable of germinating—is a cause or impulse of life; and gestation is life. But when th e living being, whether vegetable or animal, achieves its aim, whic h is a new seed, its organism deteriorates in that it is a complex g enerating the seed (male) or gestating the being (female); but death d oes not extinguish all life in the component parts of this individual. Putre- faction makes from them new lives, animal or vegeta ble. To be sure, it is always a matter of assimilation, but to another rhythm, with another character. This definition is philosophically true; but I prop ose another one, which—applied to everything, including minerals—is more correct because it is more general: \"Life is the faculty of reaction.\" Everything in the Universe tends toward inertia, or absence of reaction. The proof of this inertia, which thermodynamics seeks i n \"absolute zero,\" has never been given, nor will it ever be, b ecause absolute inertia can only be attained through the cessation of the formed 1 Evolution of an \"innate consciousness\" toward psych ological consciousness, which is \"consciousness of the innate consciousness ,\" the first stage toward a con- sciousness freed from physical contingencies. 2 Higher reason and Saint Thomas's Intellectus. 28"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"matter or \"thing.\" This would be the moment the thi ng ceased to exist. Everything \"existing\" is capable of reaction, insof ar as it has \"weight,\" that is, fixed or specific energy. The vital phenomenon is the faculty of reacting, an d to manifest i t s e l f this reaction requires a resistance of the s ame nature as the action. Thus, the l i v i n g stomach produces the juices necess ary for diges- tion, because of the signal (or resistance) of the thing to be digested, in exactly the same way the anvil (resist ance) produces reaction, or suppression of weight (elasticity), in the hammer (ac- tivity) that strikes it. Whether in the field of ch emistry, biology, or mechanics, the Law remains the same: there has to b e an action, a resistance of the same nature, and the reaction or effect. The whole is the vital phenomenon. I draw a parallel with \"vital logic\" and \"cerebral\" or \"equa- tional\"—that is to say, syllogistic—\"logic.\" The la tter is simple mechanical logic, quantitative logic; the compariso n of two ele- ments defines a third, which is a quantitative equa tion. On the other hand, vital logic is purely functional and quantita- tively unforeseeable, because of the multitude of e lements that can enter into the elaboration of the result, since her e it is a question of gestation. Vital logic applies to the reactive or v ital function. It has its exact law, which is the law of genesis, the sup reme natural expres- sion of which is given by the phases of the embryon ic and fetal genesis of man. 3 3 A few medical quotations—from La Medecine Morpholog ique by A. Thooris (Paris: G. Doin, 1937), p.72-73—will explain my point of vi ew. They relate also to the basis of the subject treated in the following pages . \"Geoffroy Saint Hilaire was the first to show that human skulls have, at a given moment in their development, a number of points of ossifica- tion equal to the number of pieces shown by the sku lls of fish. . . .

A figure or a sign represents, by analogy or convention, a given idea. To conform with the true meaning of the symbol in a ncient Egypt, we ought to use the Egyptian term Medu-Neter u, the Greek translation of which, \"heiroglyphs,\" distorts the E gyptian meaning. Medu-Neteru are the Neters, or the principles conve yed by a sign. To me, the word symbol signifies the thing itself o r the materi- alized idea that it evokes; it does not represent t he idea by analogy alone. There is a reality (that is to say, a cause with an ineluctable effect) in the Medu-Neters or symbols—as in the Chr istian image of the Cross, the statue of the Holy Virgin, the gestu res and words of the Sacrament of the Mass, in the life or legend of the Saint from whom the religion takes its name. Every image, however primitive it may be, leaves it s mark. It evokes a memory, and only that which one has known or lived can be remembered. One puts i n t o the image this \"someth ing\" of oneself. The image then no longer represents this m emory; it is the memory that is transplanted in the image. In this sense, even the conventional symbol becomes \"real\"—like an officer's badge of rank, a \"symbolic\" sword, the robes of high office. It is certainly not the habit that makes the monk; but oblige the monk to wear secular clothing and something in his attitude will change, and thereby something in his inner disposit ion. In every instance the symbol—even if it be chosen t otally arbitrarily—makes its mark, because of necessity it evokes a complex of thoughts that are projected into it; and it is t his projection that then confronts us. This manner of conceiving the symbol opens the door to a theme that would require lengthy development. When I use the word symbol, for lack of another, mo re precise word.

Thus every natural thing is th e incarnation of a principle; it is the principle's symbol. Summary of Principles LIFE is the faculty of reacting. This formula extends the definition of Life to incl ude minerals. We do not distinguish inorganic bodies from organic bodies so as to accord life only to the latter. We admit that there are organized beings and others which are not yet organized; but the latter bear, in their characteristics, (for example, chemical af finity), the ele- ments that give an impetus for future organization. This, however, will not take place in a continuous fashion, but th rough the necessary destruction of forms for the purpose of \" rebirth\"—so to speak —in higher states. It is not the form that is transmitted, but the \"permanent\" moment of the Substance. This perma nent moment (the Egyptian ka) registers the experience o f the transitory form. Thus Life is, in all things, a ternary comple x formed by an active Cause against a passive resistance that is n onetheless reactive in turn. This reaction is the apparent effect, and the whole is the vital phenomenon. INTELLIGENCE has a double nature: Intellect, or Rea son, is direct Intelligence, beyond all comparison.

This is why I should like to replace the word symbol with the word Medu-Neter, which conveys the \"signs that bear the Neters\" (\"Neter\" signifying the Principle or the Id ea in the Platonic sense). For me, a plant or an animal, for example, is a sym bol of a whole collection of vital elements crystallized in that p lant or animal, which can be what it is only through the conditions and circum- stances causing its birth. Each is the manifestatio n of an Idea and constitutes a link in the evolution of Consciousnes s, from the original Verb up to the conscious return into the C ause.

A Hypothesis and Its Evolution THE ARCHITECTURE of the Temple of Luxor, is, at fir st glance, disconcerting, From the southern sanctuary to the n orth pylons, the axis never ceases to deviate. There is scarcely a r egular shape in the plan; what seems square is rhomboidal; the inter-co lumnal spacing increases occasionally in the direction of the sanc tuary, thus com- pensating for the effect of perspective. Moreover, the entire con- struction was carried out in several phases. The Te mple of Luxor could be called a Parthenon, based on its fundament al kinship with the Parthenon of Athens. Its preferred designation has been that of a \"theogamic\" temple; but it is in fact, because of the deeper meaning of its consecration, the true Parthenon—tha t is to say. the temple devoted to the spiritual conception of Man.' Although they never sacrified anything for aestheti cs but con- formed solely to the reality of the Symbol, the pha raonic builders always achieved masterpieces of harmony—even in int entional deformities and ugliness—through symbolic and geome trical exac- titude. Nothing is sensual for them; and t h i s shocks our We stern sense of aesthetics. Everything is solely didactic, of an esoteric nature; it is a teaching for the Understanding, for pure Intel lect, a teaching that cannot be described in explicit terms. We have too many proofs showing that nothing in the ir work is the result of negligence, chance, or personal whim, for us not to look for the meaning hidden behind apparent disorde r. To avoid this research would be to miss the purpose of archa eology, which is 1 Parthenogenesis is taken here in the sense of \"crea tion,\" and not in the \"zoological\" sense of being at one point male, then female, as is the case with the androgynous mollusks. 33"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"to learn what the Past has to teach us and not to i mpose our own conceptions on the Ancients. Starting from this premise. I have tried—with neith er prejudice nor obstinacy in my hypotheses—to understand little by little what the observed fact might show us. Allowing myself to be guided by the Gothic traditio n (which bases the cathedral on the symbol of the Cross, and even occasion- ally bends the apse in memory of the bowed head of the crucified Lord), I first pictured, as the plan of the base, t he outline of a human figure to explain the strange deformation of the architec- tural plan of the temple of Luxor. Does the plan of the Basilica of Saint Peter in Rome, completed by Bernini's colonna des, not repre- sent the shape of a key? Similarly, a recumbent figure such as the reborn Os iris (placing one foot in front of the other) could very well hav e been placed over the plan of the Temple of Luxor. The feet would hav e been the pylons, the knees the two colossi seated at the ent rance of the colonnade of Amun (the colonnade representing the t highs), the peristyle court being the abdomen and the hypostyle entrance the chest (hati), the head being located in the covered sanctuary. The proportions of a body thus placed over the plan cor responded temptingly. However, only the proportions indicated by the cons truction jus- tify such a proposition. I found in my supposition an eminent pre- decessor in Etienne Drioton. 2 If his particular hypothesis, which consists of see ing the image of an Oudja eye in the plan of the sanctuaries of Meda mud, has not been borne out subsequently (the Egyptian temple is often called the \"eye\" of God), his intuition was nonetheless re markable, as we shall see in the case of the Temple of Luxor. A recumbent, reborn Osiris was. however, only a pre tty image, in keeping with our simplistic western understandin g of the symbol. Pharaonic thought, more profound, allows for no fan tasy in the expression of the living symbol. The parallel between an Egyptian temple and our cat hedrals was not suggested solely by the search for the same con ception in the 2 Etienne Drioton, \"La Protection Magique de Thebes a l'Epoque des Ptolemees,\" in Bulletin d'Ethnographie, No. 23 (19 31 ). 34"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"symbolism of the ground plan. H. Schafer believed h e had found in the Temple of Luxor the origin of the canon of the plan of the Greek basilica and its derivatives. 3 But in Christian architecture the basilica must not be confused with the cathedral viewed in the sense of \"center o f higher teaching.\" Karnak is the synthelic royal temple: Lu xor is the cathedral of \"The Great Teaching.\" Moreover, the layout of th is temple is indeed that which we encounter again in the canon o f the Gothic cathedral, except that the two pylons replace the t wo towers. The general plan of a cathedral corresponds to an e xact canon: two towers; a narthex; a nave—triple and with seven windows, as a rule—on the walls of which the stations of the Cros s are later drawn. Then comes the transept, and then the entran ce proper to the Sanctuary, the remainder being reserved for the faithful. The choir, separated from the transept by the rood screen, is itself divided according to the importance of the f orm of worship, the altar being the table for the daily sacrifice, and the repository bearing the Sacred Host in the barque of its silver crescent. In those churches that are privileged to celebrate the papal mass, the bishop's throne is behind t h e altar, hidden from th e public; it is there that he celebrates the Sacrament, as in the H oly of Holies (as is the case in the Orthodox c u l t ) . In the Temple of Luxor we find an identical layout (see fig. 1): two pylons, the court of Ramses as the narthex, the double row of seven high columns with open corollas forming the n aves with two subsidiary naves whose lateral walls are decorated with bas-reliefs representing the procession of the barque. After th e nave, with its two rows of seven columns, the peristyle extends ea st and west, forming a cross (the transept); 4 then comes the covered temple, whose parallelism with the cathedral's choir is str iking.

Thus, i t is these latter rooms, as well as rooms 8, 18, and 22, that might c onstitute the \"rood screen\" of the cathedral. This rood screen includes stairways to the right an d left. In the Temple of Luxor there exists a stairway to the west , and certain signs show that there seems to have been a second s tairway to the east originally. All these elements enable us to connect the Temple of Luxor with the Gothic cathedral. Having completed the survey, not only of scenes and of each figure but ultimately of every stone in the walls ( taking into account rectifications to be made in the case of ac cidental disjunc- tion of the blocks), I was struck by the strange po sition shown by certain paving stones, because of the way in which they were cut (figs. 4 and 5).

For we cannot trace out this head in profile any which way to complete the design shown by the pavement. The head is constructed acco rding to very precise proportions, determined here by the walls ( see fig. 9). In addition, I had to follow the openings or doors corresponding to the different passages found in the human head. For all these processes, I was guided by the \"keys\" that the Mas- ter Builders carefully set into the walls and the f loor. Here a digression is in order. I should like to poi nt out that al- ways, in the walls and on the floor of Egyptian tem ples, there are certain \"keys\" that are guides for measures. These \"little bits of stone,\" set into certain blocks, are too easily att ributed to sculptors' errors. The error lies in interpreting them thus. E ach stone has a value and a significance, I found a great number of these \"keys\" that must have been set in place at the time the construction was assembled; in fact certain keys are cut in such a way that the y could not have been set in place at any other time. I point out these facts to Egyptologists and archae ologists, that they may make some unusual observations. It is an a ct of vandal- ism to touch any stone without having first situate d it precisely on the plan, photographed it, and in any event measure d it carefully. 8 The sex organ divides the height of a man, includin g the crown of the skull into two equal parts.

The accord between the two themes develops through a common element and cr eates a sequence that explains the true (esoteric) meaning as a logical con- clusion. It often happens that the reading of texts and symbols on one wall has meaning only through this indirect sup erimposition through the wall. 9 This superimposition, which should be studied precisely in its minutest details, is repeated for hieroglyphs as well as figures (persons, attributes, and accessories). Transposition must not be confused with what I call \"trans- parency.\" I shall have occasion later to note two t ypical cases, one of transposition, the other of transparency. In the case of transparency, if the wall were made of glass one could see, for example, drawn on the verso, a sign or a figure that fills a gap on the recto. A naos or barque may rema in empty and be only a container whose contents are on the other side of the wall, in a room where its theme is specially treate d.

Thus, up to the end of the Mi ddle Ages, the Christian tradition assigned specific attributes to a given Saint, sculpted or painted, and these attributes are a ver itable scripture revealing what cannot be said in plain words. Templ es—whether Hindu. Egyptian, Jewish, Christian, or Moslem—are a lways con- ceived according to a canon that respects certain e lements which explain the teaching. In Egypt, in India, as well as later, in the Gothic period of Chris- tian cathedrals, the temple was a book revealing an \"esoteric\" teaching. Esotericism should not be understood as a rebus or a secret writing, but rather as the \"spirit of the letter\"—t hat is to say. that which cannot be transcribed clearly, not because th ere is any desire to conceal it, but because of the \"cerebral\" intellect 's inaptitude for comprehending it.

Significance of the Crown of the Skull I T IS NECESSARY to note that Egyptian figurations care fully mark—with a headband, crown, diadem, or joint—a div iding line for the top of the skull thus separating the crown of the skull.

This affected the comparative study of the \" 'Golden Section\" of the body among the ancient Egyptians as opposed to the Greek proportions.

(These two are the pneumogastric nerve s, which inner- vate and connect the head with all the vegetative f unctions of the body, and the spinal nerves, which connect the head and the neck.) The two hemispheres of the cerebrum are made up of the outer layer (cortex or mantle), composed of grey matter, and a white mass underlying the nerve fibers. From the cortex, with the two lobes of the cerebrum , stem all the orders for every action of the body; it is from the frontal ascending convolution, along the Rolandic fissure (as well as from its exten- sion on the inner surface of the cerebrum, the para central lobule) that all the motor impulses stem.

The Ancients put more value on the vital function t han on the organ of perception (currently we would say \"to lend an ear\" ). 2.

Goltz's 'dog without a brain' had lost all spontane ity and was insensitive to all psychic stimuli, calls, petting, the sight of a cat, etc. . . . Nevertheless, it wou ld walk. albeit clumsily, when it was pushed; when pinched, it would start to growl or bark or try to bite; it cou ld hear loud noises; its pupils contracted in the light, bu t its gaze always remained fixed, as though lost; placed on an inclined plane, it managed to hold itself so as not to slide; it ate with difficulty, and moreover it did not go after its food; and left on its own, it would have died. Rothmann's dog was deaf and blind, and it also lack ed the sense of smell (whence the abolition of all sex ual life); it could maintain its equilibrium and walk; it paid no attention cither to other dogs or to people; it exp erienced hunger and satiety. In summary, decerebrized animals retain, besides th e organic functions, the functions of the coordinatio n of movements and equilibration; they also retain emoti onal expression.

Thus, this part of the organs of the encephalon pla ys a very important role in the evolution of consciousness. The two hemispherical lobes of the brain are the in strument of memory and decision, hence choice. Thus, \"'Divine\" man (without t h i s part of the brain ) represents the Principle or Neter, capable of living and actin g, but only as the executant of an impulse that he receives; hence, he plays the role of an intermediary between the abstract impulse, outsi de of Nature, and its execution in Nature, without actual choice. In this regard, this entity has a primitive, and \"prenatural\" chara cter. On the other hand, natural man uses his cerebral in strument as a means of \"sufferance of nature\" (sufferance is to be interpreted as a deep experience through the conflict of consci ousness, and not as pain). He will use it as a tool of his knowledge and his freely determined actions; these actions will thus be in a greement or at variance with natural harmony. When, through his ex perience, he has developed his consciousness to the utmost perfe ction, he will no longer need his cerebral instrument to attain it: h e will need his cerebral instrument solely in order to act, in this incarnation. The life of this \"superman\" (in pure contemplation and ecstasy) will again be that of \"Divine\" man, but in consciou sness—that is to say, no longer as a blind Neter, but as a being car rying within itself all knowledge, the sum of all possible experiences. 4 Thus, Man without this crown of the skull represent s the pre- natural Adamic Man as well as Man having su rpassed Nature. 4 The crown of the skull, containing the physical org an of the brain, should not be confused with the coronal circle that surrounds thi s braincase.

Summary of Principles The motivation behind the emphasis on the crown of the skull can be summarized thus: Man's corporeal life is not an end in itself, but a state of transi- tion and a means. This is what distinguishes a spir itualistic from a materialistic concept of existence. In spiritual philosophy there exists a permanent el ement that takes on a corporeal form, momentarily.

This is the laboratory of the entire psychospiritual lif e; and only the Knowledge of this life can teach the human being th e means of surpassing his condition as a mortal creature.

Reflections on a Philosophy of Measure I SHALL NOT enter here upon an overly long developm ent of what my observations taught me about the ancient Egyptia n system of measures; I shall only note a few basic elements of their thought. transcribing these elements into a form accessible to our modern mentality. MEASURE CAN BE CONSIDERED THE QUANTITATIVE DEFINITION OF IRREDUCIBLE MAGNITUDES In order to explain irreducible magnitudes more eas ily. I shall first provide the elements of a philosophic specula tion based on a classification of these magnitudes, such as they gi ve rise to each other. Septuple order of irreducible magnitudes: Opposing the abstraction of the indivisible Unity—t hat is, of the Origin O—is the lowest term, which is the Mass M. B etween the two is located the middle term that results from th is comparison of extremes: the Space S, which is also separating Spa ce or \"extent.\" It has a double nature. Each of these magnitudes is comprehensible only thr ough the definition of the other two. Toward the Origin, the Space-Path SP plays the reactive role, while being a resultant o f the Movement 57"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"MT, which defines the Time T and the Path that is t wo-dimen- sional Space. 1 Opposing the Space (Volume) SV (three-dimensional P ath) is the reactive pole of the Mass M. This SV activity t hus summarizes, through Movement, Time and Path. Thus, the Movement of the Volume defines the Force F which—arrested by the Ma ss, which reabsorbs it—gives the Energy EN (resultant energy, the final degradation of which will be heat). The Energy of O rigin is always O. I say Volume is perceptible Space. Everything in th e Universe has Volume, and there exists no perceptible Space o ther than that of Volume. The Universe, in which there appear to b e things or volumes, is not Space; it is Spirit or Formless Sub stance. One thing is not separated from another by a Space, but, on t he one hand by a path—two-dimensional space—and, on the other, by Time. However, Time is perceptible only through the Movem ent, and the Path; thus, the Time that separates two objects is the measure of the Movement, which makes it necessary for the enti re perceptible Universe to be nothing but Movement. On the other hand, Time, defined by Movement and a Path, therefore has a beginning and an end. The impulse t hat gives in the beginning the Origin O has, as its ultimate and nec essary end, the return into itself. This is the principial cycle. I t will manifest itself in the concrete sequence in which this concrete end is the Mass or seed, summarizing the initial Energy, which took on the aspects of Time, Movement, and Space-Mass, this Mass or seed h aving con- centrated Force and resultant Energy. The Universe conceived as a living Being—Cosmic Man —is Life: that is to say, it is a gestation. Time is thus ges tation, the distance between the seed and its fruit; the Movement is the growth that produces the volume, which is only substance formed into body or 1 Two-dimensional space should be conceived as a \"pl ane\" without thickness. It is therefore a question of a \"function\" and not of a \" thing.\" However, we cannot conceive ot action without the body in motion, sinc e we only understand action through the body in motion. Thus, it is by means of Consciousness, generated by our existence, that we elaborate our \"understanding\" of the principles causing this existence. This is not the \"knowledge\" that is dire ct consciousness, hence knowledge of functions without a moving object. Exact science (which is nothing but hypotheses) appeals to this direct (a priori) consc iousness because \"Reason\" imposes on us these notions for which we have no co ncepts. 58"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"volume, by a seed, Energy O—the fermenl fixator tha t appears as Mass. In these conditions, Mass is nothing but the Energy O, the original Energy, but fixed: a ferment, a seed, the total obstacle to activity. The original activity being Absolute, the obstacle cannot be absolute; it is solely the sum of the resistance s. If the mass were absolute, it would be the legendary \"philosopher's stone\" for the seed is nothing but resistance to the activity of t he abstract sub- stance that thus takes form. A defined seed gives d efined form. An absolute obstacle would give the universal form, wh ich, ultimately, would blend anew with its Cause. Granting this, let us return to our subject, taking up again cer- tain points noted in this explanation. Just as the Movement defines Time and Space, the me asure of length (movement) defines duration and path. But wh en Space—as path—must become Volume, Mass, the extreme pole of irreducible magnitudes, must be made to intervene. Between thes e two extremes, Space-Mass, lie Force and Energy. In fact . Movement, with Time, produces the Path that produces Force; a nd Force, arrested, will produce Energy (resultant energy). It is Volume that summarizes Weight, Force, and Ene rgy; and it is Movement that summarizes Time and Path. Volume belongs to everything that exists; that, is to say, every- thing in the Universe has Volume. It is thus the su mmary of what we may call the \"concrete series\" of irreducible ma gnitudes. The \"abstract series\" (considered \"causally\" and in dependently of \"things\") comprises Time and Space, represented by the Move- ment (causal Verb) 2 which will be, of necessity, in physics as well as metaphysics, the quantitative definition indispe nsable at the beginning. Thus, no measurement is possible without the establ ishment of a Unit that will be a measure of length. But, inversely, if we want to remain within a \"phil osophical truth\" this Unit of length will be dependent on all the irreducible principles that are at the root of Knowledge. 2 The French Le Verbe is conventionally rendered as t he Word (or Logos). We have retained \"Verb\" in this translation because of the author's intention of conveying the sense of an eternally acting power at the origi n of creation.—Trans. 59"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"A conventional metrical system that has only a prac tical mean- ing, can thus be established, or a philosophic metr ical system that will be integrated with Knowledge. In both cases logic would lead us to choose as a ba sis a geodetic datum, the most general and always verifiable. The rationalist, materialistic mentality, using thi s principle, has combined the decimal system with the geometric prin ciple that, obligatorily, divides the circle of a day (the equa torial cycle) into four parts; then, subdividing each part into ten (o r 10 6 ), it pro- claimed this size to be the unit of measure—our met er. There is an error in this way of thinking. The anci ent Egyptians were perfectly well acquainted with this meter, as is frequently shown, but they did not use it to measure a circuit . Indeed, only imaginary lines, such as the axis of a body revolving around itself or the diameter of a curve, can be co nceived as being straight. Every other line, in the Universe, that i s nothing but Movement, will be curved. The Egyptians remain faithful to philosophic reason and make of measure an expression of Knowledge; that is to say that measure has for them a universal meaning linking the things of here below with things Above (vital equivalences), and not solely a n immediate, practical meaning as in the COS system of modern sc ience, a sim- ple system of quantitative equivalence. It is certainly impossible to specify a basis, immu table and applicable to everything, according to the simple measurement of objects—even if the object were the earth. Everything is moving, everything is variable; this is the property of the created being and hence of the universe. Quantity is unstable; only function has a value dur able enough to serve as a basis. Now, our rational discipline no l onger permits us to glimpse a solution from that angle; however, it was character- istic of the mentality of the Ancients, which peopl e today would prefer to classify pejoratively as \"Oriental Mystic al thought.\" This classification is, in my opinion, somewhat over-sim plified. The measurements of numerous skeletons by Hambidge 3 have shown that there is a principle of proportion i n the size of the 3 Cited by Mattila C.

Cuvier could boast of having reconstituted an antediluvian anima l from a few fossilized bones, because there is a harmony proper to each \"ensemble\" (or individual) formed by Nature. But if a man constitutes an ensemble, a Unit that h as its har- mony, he is himself part of a whole. He cannot be b orn without being in relationship with his environment, and thi s environment extends as far as the solar system. This is a bold concept, and its philosophic nature is not in keeping with the mode of thought of our analyst scholars. At most it might be conceded that here we are deali ng with proportion, and not measurements. Indeed, it is in this fact that the whole problem lies; it is a question of recognizing what is the real value, proportion or measurement? Proportion belong s to geometry and harmony, measurement to the object and to arith metic; and one necessitates the other. Proportion is the compa rison of sizes; harmony is the relationship of measures; geometry i s the function of numbers. In an \"extreme formula\" it could be said that, if a man has a true module, it is because the entire universe is, for him, harmonized according to his personal module; he will understan d and see it inasmuch as he is himself. And since the Universe e xists for us only through our consciousness and our particular intell ectual faculties, nothing, in truth, opposes the admission of the \"ex treme formula.\" With this way of seeing, all rational science colla pses, all scien- tific thought is precluded. A Universal harmony, through a set of proportions, could even- tually be conceded; but the Ancients, on the contra ry, accorded all value to the measure and founded the universal Harm ony on a basic measure particular to the man and to the place, thu s variable and corresponding to life rather than to quantity. Opposing a conventional, rational CGS system, is a natural, vitally true philosophic system. What I've just said suffices to explain why the anc ient Egyptians' Unit of measurement was always variable. We find the importance of the measurement called th e \"cubit\" supported, however, by the exceptional nature of th e \"gift of the cubit\" to very high dignitaries. 61"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"We know, on the other hand, that a stable and uncha nging basis exists, and that it results precisely from this nat ural philosophy, a knowledge to which the ceremony of the Royal Gift a lludes. Thus, if the Ancients so carefully hid the secret of this knowledge from the uninitiated, it would be wise to look for the r eason. Indeed, the fact of having in Nature, which is always moving, a fixed support (like that which Archimedes called for, \"to take th e world off its hinges\"), would show that everything is connected b y an unfailing logic; and this small fact would entail enormous co nsequences. But for the measurement of the human body, one must be con- tent with proportions based on a particular coeffic ient. One cannot fit a l i v i n g thing—whether it be human society or t he individual— into a theoretical scheme. All the modern attempts to formulate an \"average\" for measurements, including Viola's \"Norm otype,\" are misleading. The famous \"golden section\" of the Gree ks is a systematization that, has carried us away from a li ving science, and pharaonic antiquity was very careful not to commit such an error. For architecture, the downfall was completed with t he systematization of Vitruvias. In ancient Egypt, measure and proportions can be ad apted to the purpose and the symbolic meaning of the idea to be expressed. The cubit will not. necessarily be the same from one te mple to another, since these temples are in different places and the ir purposes are different. The cubit will not be the same for measu ring one Neter or another, according to whether the Neter is Horia n or Osirian. primordial created, or natural (transitory principl e). But each cubit corresponds in itself to a definite value, which me ans it can be used under specific conditions. 4 In the Temple of Luxor columns arc made in varying propor- tions—soaring or massive, depending on whether it i s a question of a growth or a foundation. The capitals represent bu ds opened up to breathe or closed to bear fruit. Measures and propo rtions provide a valuable guide for reading the meaning of these sym bols. 4 In this connection. I can fill a gap that, Kamel O shman Chalet Pasha was obliged to leave in his very interesting work on \"T he Nilometric Cubit\" in the Bulletin de la Societe Royale de Geographic, vol. 2 1, (1943). Here, the author reports the existence of a cubit, called the \"Black Cubit,\" of unknown origin.

To illustrate the \"vital\" nature of measure and to make my explanation more comprehensible, let us imagine the following example: It is a question of measuring a tree X and a tree Y . Today a yardstick of some kind would be used. The measureme nt would be a relative determination, calculated by units and f ractions, and we should obtain only a comparison of sizes between th e circumfer- ences of the trunks, the heights, etc., of these tw o trees. With the system of measurement based on the philoso phic, \"vitalist\" principle, two different cubits would be employed, one for tree X and the other for tree Y, but these cubits w ould not be chosen arbitrarily. In fact, each of these individual members of the ve getable kingdom belongs to a genus, and this genus to a fam ily; and these families belong to an original \"lineage.\" At the he ad of this lineage is a Neter, a \"Principle\" synthesizing all the char acteristics of this lineage: its number, its rhythm, its classific ation in the general harmony. from the court of Ramses to the great colonnade.

Thus the \"cubit,\" whose strange divisions are geome tric, astro- nomical, and geodetic coordinales, has a vital mean ing. On the contrary, the comparison of relative sizes i s a quantitative conclusion, which in this case has no meaning. The principle of the Neter is associated with the c ubit. The proof is found in the hieroglyphic system: the sign of the cubit is represented by a section of the forearm as suming the out- line of the recumbent sign of the Neter, 5 which confirms the brief explanation just given. Let us note again the importance of the color of th e sign. Often the \"stalk\" of the hieroglyph Neter is colored gree n, symbol for \"vegetable,\" the Neter being considered as the seed that sum- marizes all the possibilities of a particular rhyth m (figs. 17-18).

But when it is a matter of speaking a bout this tree as a symbol in a text of a sacred nature, the use of the particular cubit—or, inversely, the attribution of this tree t o a definite Neter— takes on an extremely important significance.

This tradition has been preserved in modern Astrolo gy, which attributes a given plant to a particular planetary lineage. However, this is but the ABC of a real science that was prac ticed in ancient Egypt in the full knowledge of cause and effect. Let us further elucidate, by means of a geometrical image, the role of the Neter as head or Principle of a lineage . From the sides of any angle (less than 90 degrees) one can, at any point, drop a perpendicular line to form simila r right triangles. The angle can be likened to the Neter. The proporti on or rhythm that it imposes is invariable, whereas the sizes or quantities of the triangles that it defines are innumerable. As for the measurement of man, there is one proport ion that can be considered as only slightly variable: ratio of t he height to the arm span, or fathom (fathom implies circuit). And the tradition of the fathom has come down to us . It is the fathom that plays the greatest role in th e measures of the Temple of Luxor, dedicated to the Incarnation o f the Spirit, or the Creation of Man. Just as there is little difference between the cubi ts (the small cubit of 24 digits) of men normally large or small, so the fathom varies little among men who work a lot with their a rms. In prac- tice, a sailor can, with little error, measure his ropes and cables according to the size of his armspan, which will al ways be close to the meridian fathom at 45° latitude. That is to say that the fathom is at once an average human measure and a measure of t he earth's circumference. A thousand fathoms (the nautical mile) equal one mi nute of an arc, 65"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"the meridian arc now being established conventional ly at 45° latitude. We see the fathom (or rather fathoms) used constant ly in the architecture of the Temple of Luxor. Let us note th at there also exists a sacred fathom. 6 Here is an example in regard to the fathom: the str ange rhom- boidal distortion of the plans of the west pylon pr ompted us to measure them carefully several times, rectifying th e gaps between the stones (which are sound in this location)—gaps caused by set- tling or other accidental causes. The length of the pylon under the cornice, between tori gives, from the north side (along 12 fathoms), the meridia n fathom at 90° (North Pole), and from the south side the meridian fathom at 0° (Equator); that is, respectively 1.86166 m and 1.84 29 m (difference along 12 fathoms = 22.5 m). This could be a coincidence, but these measurements recur at several important points; let us therefore concede a repeating coin- cidence . . . I shall also add that the function or proportion of the golden sec- tion is constantly operative in Egyptian architectu re. It is employed with great subtlety and no mystery. With a little p recision in taking measurements, it is easily found. The Golden Number does not act solely as a function of an ideal proportion, but serves as the basis for a philosoph y that makes the connection between the metaphysical state and the p hysical state. It is in this connection that the Golden Number's \" sacred\" char- acter consists. Furthermore, the human body develop s in terms of this number. 6 I use the epithet \"sacred\" to designate what, in th e teaching of the temple, had a key value. 66"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Summary of Principles The aim of analysis is to split up a thing or an id ea until it is reduced to an irreducible element. One thus reaches magnitudes such that each of them can only be defined by two o ther magnitudes. This is the original \"trinity,\" indispe nsable for all cerebral consciousness, which can only apply to qua ntities. This \"trinity\" is the Measure of an irreducible magnitud e. While, in the deistic conception, the origin of the world req uires a Trinity in one \"Person,\" in pharaonic Egypt we see this princi ple applied to the origin of each natural \"lineage\" of the divine manifestation. These ternary groups are thus spiritual \"Measures\" that are then translated by Numbers. The development of these Num bers con- stitutes characteristic rhythms. This development, as a Number, is inevitable and therefore is a Law. The Number should not be considered as arithmetical \"enumera- tion,\" but as an Entity. The Number is thus the ext reme reduction of the philosophic thought. The Number is the fathe r of a lineage, like the Trinity; but it is a \"father\"—or entity—wi thout a specify- ing name. In ancient China the Number One was consi dered to have the value Three. This seems to be true in anci ent Egypt as well. The first five numbers, as well as all the prime nu mbers, are Entities, each having a value in itself, independen t of enumeration. Thus it is that the numbers two, three, four, and f ive are Units and not compounds of Units. For example: the number four is the value that dete rmines forms; it has the characteristic of determining the equali ty of the surface and circumference of a circle or square. A square w hose side is four measures sixteen in circumference and sixteen in surface. A cir- cle whose diameter is four measure 4*pi in circumfe rence and 4*pi in surface. This is only one example of \"calculation.\" In fact, it is the philosophic consideration of functions that gives N umbers their real value and constitutes the \"Science of Numbers.\" The latter bears no relation to our current mathematics. The Science of Numbers operates constantly in ancie nt Egypt's application of Measures. 67"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV.

The temple set on virgin soil, with no real foun dation.

If a certain cell ought to be hexagonal, it will be so—since it is l i v i n g , and growing—it adapt s i t s e l f according to the needs of the moment and of the place. Similarly, certain chambers, apparently square or r ectangular in plan, will be slightly rhomboidal or trapezoidal. O ne need only examine, in their angles, the cut of t h e stones to establish that for this distortion, an exceptional effort was required to give these angles a few degrees more or less than a right angl e. The same kind of rhomboids or trapezoids can be fou nd on the surfaces of the walls or tableaux. We might be incl ined to attribute this to an oversight, but these distortions are ins istently compen- sated for or occasionally repeated. The purpose of this is always to specify measure in the spirit that I have described . For example: The north wall of room 12, with its tw elve columns, shows a slight concave curve, verifiable a long two-thirds of its length. Obviously one is tempted to attribut e this curve to a modification of the entire construction. However, e ach of the blocks making up this wall is cut with a slight curve havi ng the same versed sine.

A longitudinal axis for construction—\"the general axis of measures.\" 3. An axis dividing the width of the naos of Amun into equal parts—\"the horary axis of Amun.\" The geometric axis is marked in sanctuary I under the platform (see fig. 25), but its influence works in an occult mann er.

This \"displacement\" action is cons tant, not only for the plan of an entire building, but for the fig ure as well; and this corresponds to a purpose. 5 In the ceiling of the Amunian naos of Alexander th ere is a reused sandstone trave whose ornamentation is similar to that of the pink granite architrave at the entrance to the chapel of Amun, of the repository o f Ramses II, in the first court of the temple. 73"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"We must, once and for all, conceive of the pharaoni c temple as a seed in the process of bearing its fruit. It is truly the most grandiose conception of architecture. However, a building is by nature rigi d. One could, if need be, imagine figurations that would recall this gestation. That would be rational, but not vital, as in the spirit of the ancient Egyptians. For them, the entire building had to liv e. This charac- teristic of gestation may have prompted Herbert Ric ke 6 to consider pharaonic architecture \"vegetal.\" This is correct, since all gestation comprises both growth and vegetation, but this stri ct enclosure in a formula, corresponding to the weslern mentality, is devoid of life. Growth unfolds in three dimensions; and gestation i s a constant transformation until the perfection of the new seed . Comparison with other known examples, such as the a fore- mentioned Kamutef, will reveal the method used to m ake this architecture \"live.\" The reasoning might be the following: Since every generation involves a growth in volume, since all growth can only take place in a harmonious rhythm ( that is to say, proportional to a particular coefficient), and sinc e this rhythm is indisputably ordained by phi (the Golden Number), i t is sufficient to know the module (coefficient) particular to the species or to the individual member of the species or of the Neter Pr inciple to make a \"living,\" harmoniously (magically) correct form, developing an architecture or image from this module with phi. In response to this reasoning one might raise the o bjection that phi is the golden section of a line, but it does no t apply to surfaces. And as for volumes, the problem seems to have no so lution. In mathematical—indeed, scientific and aesthetic—te rms, what the very erudite Mattila C. Ghyka 7 has written about the Golden Number could scarcely be surpassed. However, here o ne finds only the quantitative aspect of the question, for the An cients did not approach the problem in the same way. There is a philosophic aspect not under- stood by the West. Like a Renaissance man, Ghyka allows himself to be tempted by the ''Fibonacci series,\" which affords a pulsation of the value phi. 6 See Herbert Ricke, Bemerkungen zur Aegyptische n Baukunst des allen Reichs, vol. 1 (1944). 7 Manila C.

I maintain that my reasoning is applicable and that the preced- ing objection has no value, because there does not exist a value phi for sur- faces, and there does exist a Golden Number for vol umes. In constructing figures, one must not depart from t he figure in order to deduce its movements; this is merely study ing it. It is necessary to find the geometric construction that makes it move. There are two axes of construction: The axis of stability, which passes through the ear (inner ear, equilibrium) and ends in the sole of the foot. The axis of movement, which theoretically passes th rough the eye (it is sight that directs) and the big toe (it is on th e ball of the foot that one places one's weight in order to move forwa rd). There are four forms of application: the immobile f igure, the figure about to move (the case of the Kamutef cited ), the figure in motion (the normal stride) and running (the long st ride). The principle of motion through pivoting is applied to the famous figure of the Kamutef located at N on the ge neral plan. Figures 27 and 28 show the application of the outli nes, taking into account all the stone joints, and prove that these stone joints are not located haphazardly. One might raise the objection that this figure was drawn, and placed in relationship, on an older wall. It is none- theless true that the figure corresponds point by p oint with the set of joints; the accessory figures of the symbol are, on the other hand, always traced according to one of the functions of phi. There is, indisputably, a geometric basis acting as a grid for the construction of this figure. This geometric basis is found everywhere, but the m odule varies, which means that the symbolic meaning must be sough t within this module. The entire construction of the temple can be broken down, as Ludwig Borchardt has pointed out, into three phases .

Then there is added the court of the colossi (calle d the court of Ramses), with the pylons. It is obvious that the overall plan pre-existed and that it was known to those who executed it. This is shown by: 1. the strict observance of proportions that cannot al ways be the result of coincidences; 2. the axis of Amun, which was traced by the first bui lders under the paving of the sanctuary of the barque of Amun and ends, in the north, quite precisely on the axis of the Amunian chapel set up in the colonnade of the court of Rams es, along the south face of the first pylon; 3. the astronomical character of the movement of the g eome- trical axis (see chapter V, \"Orientation\").

Summary of Principles A plan requires systematization to apply an idea. A ll systemati- zation requires a logic, imposing a constant in the manner of exe- cution.

For the subject occupying these pages, I have merel y indicated this play in the plans, but it applies equally to v olumes. The pharaonic Masters did not make the mistake of s tarting from a \"Euclidian point.\" The \"point\" is divine and incomprehen- sible, whereas in Nature everything has volume. Thu s it is from volume that they start, because their thinking is p ositive. They do not base their geometry on an indefinable moral or sentimental abstraction. Their goal is to awaken the Consciousn ess of what we call God. Their means, on the contrary, are positiv e (i.e., within the laws of matter), as the terrestrial environment of our existence is positive. The Upanishads also teach that it is i mpossible for us to learn elsewhere what we are incapable of learnin g within our bodies. The whole point is to activate the higher faculties , and not be content with the deceptive means of cerebral intell igence. The volume, once cut, gives the plane. The latter i s comprehen- sible. Three edges, at least, determine a point; th is point has a meaning, because it is ternary. This mode of thought opens the doorway onto a \"Math ematical Philosophy\"; it is this philosophy that is expresse d in the plan of the Temple of Luxor. 79"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"CHAPTER V. Orientation IT IS THE axes of the Temple of Luxor that throw th e most light on the architectural principle of the pharaonic tem ple. They are marked on the ground, and this fact may be verified . It is this construction on three axes that gives \"m ovement\" to the entire architecture, thus creating that \"living sta te\" of which I spoke in the chapter on \"The Plan.\" Each of these a xes has, in addition to its mystical meaning, a practical meani ng connected with it. We must first establish the north-south orientation . In this con- nection, we encounter a problem which must be point ed out. It will always be difficult, if not impossible, to establis h, amid construc- tions such as that of Luxor, a true magnetic north with an ordinary compass. The more sensitive the compass, the more i t will undergo deviations due to the masses of blocks made of gene rally ferrugi- neous sandstone. In the Temple of Luxor is added th e effect of iron bars set in the cement, recently inserted to consol idate certain parts of the masonry that were threatening to fall into r uins. Thus, unless one were to use an adjusted marine compass, one cou ld never establish, with any certainty, a magnetic north ena bling one to calculate true north. For this reason I used the Su n, which does not deceive. The general axis is at an angle of 33° 34' from nor th-south. This is the axis of measures. It divides the south facad e of the temple into two parts that are unequal, like most of the \" votive\" cubits that have come down to us.

There are variations of durat ion, from sunrise to noon and from noon to sunset; but that is not wh at matters here. It must be noted that the morning sun is not the same, vitally, as the afternoon sun, as every experienced gardener well knows. It is not a question of an accumulation of heat in the course of the day but of a different radiation that affects a ll life, as an emis- sion of ultra-violet or infra-red rays could do (an d probably does).

The Christ cult is a solar cult; that is why cathedral choirs are oriented toward the ris ing sun. They are never found orientated exactly east-west, for t he reason that only the North Pole is relatively fixed; the east-w est bar of the Cross of orientation is mobile through the seasons. A fixed east- west direction is purely theoretical. In the case o f the pharaonic temple, observation of the orientation is a valuabl e indication of the temple's meaning. This would require an explanation that I must reduc e here to a few indications. We are so accustomed to the terms \"left\" and \"right\" that we no longer accord any interest to th eir considera- tion. However, they express something other than co nventional designations. In Nature, left and right have a \"vit al\" value. Hence, bodies suspended in the Universe turn around their axes. The North Pole will be defined as the movement that , seen from this North Pole, turns from right to left. Seen fro m the South Pole, this same body turns from left to right. This is no t simply a ques- tion of relative appearance: the physical effect is completely- different. Let us note something not generally know n: that is, that the North Pole attracts and the South Pole repels, with respect to the masses of these rotating bodies. Our North Pole hollows out the earth and it can be said to absorb the continents, whereas the South Pole extrudes earth and it can be said to create th e continents. The entire mass of our continents is projected in a spiral motion toward the North Pole. This observed fact modifies the current con- ception of the poles of a rotating mass. There are nol two effects, hut three: south versus south repels, north versus sout h attracts, north versus north is neutral. For the ancient Egyptians the south is that which r ealizes, that which gives body. The north is that which inspires. This is a brief, schematic account.

For instance, the arms, characterized as lef t or right, are sometimes represented, depending on the intention, with two left hands or two right hands. The left hand receives, t he right gives.

The figure of man that serves as the basis of the T emple of Luxor is prenatural Neter man, for the nasopharynge al opening remains closed and will not be opened until the end of the pharaonic epoch. This will be the epoch of his natu ral animation or earthly incarnation, corresponding to the moment wh en the child inhales air as it is born into this world. Until th is time, this Neter man does not breathe the outer a i r and lives only t hrough his inner ear, symbol of his direct inspiration. 2 The respiratory canal is indicated, along the axis of the temple from the hypostyle room (lungs) into room 12 (rear nasal fossae), by an uninterrupted series of long paving stones wh ich cross the thresholds of all the doorways and pass under the w all (still closed under Amenophis III) that separates rooms 6 and 12.

In support of this thesis I give here the physiolog ical application of the act of swallowing which will give me the opp ortunity to pre- sent a brief example of interpreting the correspond ences among a physiological function, the architecture, and the f igurations. During swallowing we do not breathe into the lungs; but if. at this moment, one closes one's nostrils, the auditor y perception of external sounds is altered. Thus Understanding 3 is opened up. This is not mere supposition, but the secret of the occu lt effect of pronouncing certain words (Mantram). The reason is (hat the Eustachian tube, which provides a i r to the eardrum (middle ear) is usually closed and opens only at each swallowing mo vement by the following mechanism: the rear nasal fossae are norm ally in commu- nication with the oral part of the pharyn x, through the naso- 2 The styles of catalepsy of certain Hindu \"fakirs'' are achieved through closing this passage by swallowing the tongue. 3 In French the word for understanding (entendement) shares the same root as entendre, \"to hear\" or \"to understand.\"—Trans. 96"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"pharyngeal passage (the part of the wall between ro oms 6 and 12 opened in the late dynastic period). This passage i s occluded by the action of the muscles of the staphylopharyngeal pil lars, which con- tract and join at the moment of swallowing. At this moment the orifice of the Eustachian tube opens, under the pre ssure of the soft palate (south partition of room 2, representing the coronation). However, for swallowing to take place there must be a liquid medium; the production of saliva is thus of great i mportance. The salivary secretion of the sublingual and submaxilla ry glands (north partition of room 2, representing the swamp 4 ) is instigated by the \"cord of the eardrum,\" a nerve so named because it traverses the eardrum. The nerve that innervates these glands is called the tympanicolingual nerve, but experiments have shown that only the cord of the eardrum gives these glands t h e i r se cretory fibers. This phenomenon of \"the calling to the inner ear'' may be com- pared with the gesture of \"swallowing one's saliva\" in moments of extreme concentration, when one finds oneself hard pressed for an answer. * On the east side of room 12 is located the eye, mar ked on the ground. In this room is developed the theme of the twelve hours of the day. The young King enters from the east and re aches puberty.

And, therefore, where there are swampy parts of the body, there are found the glands; and proof of this is that where there are g lands there also are hairs. Nature produces glands and hairs. Glands and hairs are equally useful: glands for the affaent humor, as has been said; hairs, having precisely what the glands fur- nish them, spring up and grow, gathering the superf luity which seethes toward the extremities. But there, where the body is dry, ther e are neither glands nor hairs.\" 97"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"should principally seek in Horus the symbolization of the eye, and its relation to the center of visual consciousness. The medulla oblongata, from which stem the twelve p airs of cranial nerves, ends in the west side of room 12. F rom the medulla the marrow continues into the spinal column, and fr om the marrow stem all the sensory and motor spinal nerves. Howev er, if there is a central severance of the motory nervous channel, ex citation of the sole of the foot will show there is a break in the motory a rc. Normally- plantar excitation of the feet causes a flexion of the toes toward the soles, and when the big toe disassociates from the other toes (that is to say, remaining extended while the others are bent), it is a sign of a central interruption of the motory nervous cha nnel. However, on the one hand, the theme of the \"Nine Bo ws,\" 5 generally placed under the feet of the King, is ind icated at Luxor by the group of archers on the north face of the east pylo n, where the soles of the feet are located (see fig. 39).

Room 6 deserves particular attention, since it show s us, among other things, the state of this sanctuary under Ame nophis III. at the place where the present naos was erected, under Alexander the Great. There still exist the sockets for the socle of the barque, for the wooden naos, for the entry step, and for the twelve posts to support a veil surrounding the naos and the four columns of Amenophis III. The same is true for the two low ramps for the asce nt toward the sacred barque (see figs. 37 and 38). It is on the site of these columns of Amenophis III that the naos of Alexander is built. Let us take note of a tenden cy to reveal, from this time on, what had hitherto been kept secret. T his naos is a masterpiece for the study of Numbers. The Ptolemaic epoch, mark- ing the end of the Egyptian mission, had as its goa l ''opening the doorways\" to the teachings of the past, which motiv ated the actual construction of the symbolic doorways that characte rize this time. The organs of the direct intellect—principally, the pituitary gland (hypophesis) and the pineal \"eye\" (epiphysis) —are located in the southern secret sanctuaries. The pituitary gland, being located at the entrance of room 1 (the central secret sanctuary) is thus considered a door way—that is to say, as a passage (see fig. 35). Room 1 contains what physiology defines textually a s \"the trig- onum or four-pillared vault that joins the two horn s of Amun.\" There could be no better description of the archite ctural aspect and the function of this sanctuary. The starting points of the cornices of the base of the naos are an integral part of the southern columns. Everything h ere bears the stamp of a duality. In this same room are located the \"choroid plexuses \" in which a mysterious transformation takes place between the b lood and the cerebrospinal liquid.

The three southern sanctuaries are separated by wal ls. This separation does not exist in the human head; but in ner exchanges, as yet unexplained, occur in the organs located in this place, and here the walls present one of those typical instanc es of \"trans- position\" that I mentioned in chapter I. The readin g of a partition (image and text) remains absolutely incomplete with out its complement given on the other surface of the same wall. A similar instance, but of transparency, is found i n the wall separating room 12 from room 5. If one superimposes the sagittal section of a skull on the plan, one observes, in fa ct, that this wall represents the \"lamina cribrosa of the ethmoid bone \" and that the olfactory bulb is found in room 5, and the zone of olfactory sensa- tion in room 12. The olfactory ramifications pass t hrough the lamina cribrosa (see fig. 35). However, on the side of the wall in room 12 we find on the sur- face the symbols for fabrics, and, in transparency in room 5, the \"boxes for cloths\" (fig. 41). The explanations that I provide here are intended t o point out one of the secrets for the true reading of the text s. This inscription of the \"cloths\" and of the \"box fo r cloths\" placed in transparency, deserves special attention, in order to confirm—with proof of the Egyptian knowledge of the most secret functions of the human organism—the method of teach ing employed by the Ancients, and the way we should end eavor to decipher it. Among the cerebral organs, the olfactory organ is t he oldest; that is to say, it is the earliest (like the sun at the eastern horizon). It is in room 5, at the point where the hieroglyph for th e \"box for cloths\" is found, that the olfactory bulb for the h ead marked in the pavement is located.

Thus, we frequently find the symbol for cloths in t hese three secret sanctuaries. Figure 42 shows clearly what I am suggesting here.

It bears the fig ures of thirteen harnessed horses, of which the thirteenth (according to the m easurements) falls at exactly the height of the first lumbar vertebra.

It is thus certain that these, lunar crescents are intentional. 9 They are clearly marked at Luxor in the north row o f the columns of the hypostyle, and they continue, dimini shing pro- gressively, toward the southern rows.

Egyptology must be practiced on the site and not solely in the study. It has been said that the Master Builders of the ca thedrals ex- pressed themselves in stone, and this is true. But who has thought to give his full attention both to the meas- ures (in order to find in them the meaning of numbe rs) and to the figurations based on pharaonic myth? Who, in this v ein, has attempted the true reading of the hieroglyphic sign s? This implies the study of the intentional meaning o f each document—or, more exactly, the meaning it should ha ve. Thus, having noted the separation of the crown of the sku ll, one should try to find out what it means, since t h i s point was emphasized. One should not conclude, on the basis of an apparently primary text, that the Ancients wished to say what we understand: one must try to find out why they expressed themselves thus. The Ancients never \"popularized\" anything; to the u ninitiated they provided only the minimal useful teaching. The explanation, the philosophy, the secret connection between the m yth and the sciences were the prerogative of a handful of speci ally instructed men. Did not Pythagoras wait twenty years before be ing admitted into the Temple? Did he not, in his own teaching, i mpose silence on pain of death? Therefore, this teaching was not written down. Herodotus often mentions the obligation he was unde r to remain silent concerning \"sacred\" subjects. Therefore, the se instructions had not been changed. Furthermore, the druidical teaching was the privile ge of a priest- ly class, guardians of the most secret oral traditi ons of a people. People cling obstinately to the \"classical\" prejudi ce and, in order to defend this thesis, prefer to link the ancient E gyptians with the anthropoids! They would even diminish the value tha t the Greeks had in demonstrating the great Knowledge of ancient Egypt. Did not the ancient Greeks go to study in the sanct uaries of Lower Egypt, as close to the source as possible? Th ey had fewer prejudices than their modern champions! When Grapow denies the Ancients a knowledge of the nerves, of the circulat ion of blood, etc., we can remind him that Hippocrates, as Iversen rece ntly confirmed (Carlsberg Papyrus No. 8, 1939), bor rowed extensively from 106"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"pharaonic documents, and did so in B.C. 450.

It is certain that the Greek documents that have co me down to us intact are rare, whereas the Egyptian monuments and texts provide inviolate evidence of their concepts and mo des of expres- sion.

In conclusion to the foregoing, the pharaonic teach ing shows us Man composed of three beings: the sexual being, the corporeal being, and the spiritual being. Each has its own bo dy and organs. These three beings are interdependent, in the flux of juices and the nervous influx; the spinal marrow is the column of \"fire\" that con- nects the whole. The being properly called \"corporeal\" is the body—t he chest and abdomen, where the organs for the assimilation of solids, liquids, and air are located. The head is the container of the spiritual being, w here the blood, built up in the body, comes to be spiritualized in order to nourish the nervous flux and prepare the \"ferments\" of the blood and the \"seed.\"\" This is a greatly condensed aspect of Man in the im age of the Universe. 11 I.e., the epiphysis.

No vital link coordinates this purely encyclopedic knowledge. One would seek in vain knowledge of this kind and a special vocabulary in ancient Egypt. The myth is a whole, the synthesis of all science, since it transcribes the the parietal part involves the maximum development and shows a crystalline lens, a vitreous body, a true retina complete with rods, and cellular elements that can be homologated with choroid elements. In man, one can picture three structures that combi ne to form the pineal apparatus, in which only the epiphysis shows much d evelopment. Only since 1900 has the study of this organ become more exact, picturing its effect on the genital glands. Today, the supposed v isual vestige of the parietal apparatus is still assumed, as well as a developmen t among the higher vertebrates of the pineal apparatus, which has a genital influe nce. Thus there are two forma- tions, the first of which is atrophying. It is thought that epiphysectomy entails a distinct increase in the development of the genital gland, and moreover, that the epiphysis has a restraining effect on sex- ual development. The absence of the effect of an epiphysectomy at an adult age seems to prove the predominant role of the pineal gland at the per iod of puberty. It is thought that the pineal gland does not affect the sexual glands directly but probably through the intermediary of the hypophysis. Anatomically, it is located below the lower lamina of the tela chorioidea and is attached by two of its six peduncles to the anterio r pillars of the trigonum. The wall separating rooms 1 and 7 probably represents t he \"tela chorioidea.\" Moreover, in room 7, the King is a young boy betwee n seven and twelve years of age, and this is the only place where he is repr esented at this age and accom- panied by his mother.

The Crossing: Egyptian Mentality THE FEW basic philosophical elements that I have br iefly reviewed in an effort to explain the method of the Ancients for applying architectural symbolism, are not sufficient to expl ain the basis of the mentality of pharaonic Egypt. I have said that this mentality presented itself as vitalist, but this epithet does not simply mean that a spiritual or me taphysical principle presides over Life. That would be a defin ition in the occidental spirit, consistent with a direct mentali ty, which I call \"mechanical\" because each element of the thought is given directly and meshes with another thought to formulate a conc lusion within set limits. I also call this mentality \"mechanical\" because it seeks to make every notion objective and attributes all t he value to the \"thing,\" to the arrested idea—that is to say, the i dea framed in time and space. The pharaonic mentality is typically indirect. A de fined form is used to evoke the Idea of this form—that is to say, the abstract complex that presides over this defined form. The best way to make myself understood would be the following image: If, in a fairly dark room we stare at a spot of bri ght light for a while, when we close our eyes, we shall see, in l ieu of this bright spot, the same spot, only dark. Similarly, i f we stare at a bright color, for example, green, when we close o ur eyes, we shall see the exactly complementary shade of red. The Occidental would say that light and the color g reen are the reality. The ancient Egyptian would say that the re ality is the inner vision, outside of the object. 111"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"This example can also be used to explain what I mea n by vital reaction. The concept \"vitalist\" implies, for the A ncients, the evi- dence of the vital phenomenon as based on the princ iple of reaction. We find a very similar mental disposition in China, at least in the ancient China still imbued with the Wisdom of o ld. There is a valid psychological reason behind this m anner of thought. The fact of expressing a desire very easil y provokes a sub- conscious resistance or doubt. Now, there is more p ower in subcon- scious doubt than in conscious belief: hence the in stinctive and unconscious race to deny—or prevent—the production or realiza- tion of what was desired. But the reason for this \"indirect mentality\" among the ancient Egyptians is based on the certain fact that everyth ing in Nature (which is alive) is provoked by the action of the c omplement. This creates the crossing 1 and the play of resistance. Before one can inhale deeply, one must first exhale all the air in the lungs. This would be the vital reaction, the re action of the organism, which is its real action and not the volu ntary action imposed on it. Similarly, the decomposing action of death brings a bout new life in organic matter: hence the paradox, that we die t he moment the cells of our bodies cease dying, for it is their co nstant death that supports life—that is to say, regeneration. However, this is still only the physical aspect of reaction. For the mental aspect and consciousness, the reality of man is aroused by provoking the reaction through the brutal, concrete fact. This reality, which is in us, is measured by the state o f consciousness or of intellectual culture. We react to the extent tha t is fitting for us, and this will be a factual reality, whereas the tho ught imposed on us remains outside of us; that is to say, it penetr ates no further than into our memory. And only what we have experie nced (one might say \"suffered\") impregnates our being and can modify our innate consciousness. The reasoning could be formulated generally as foll ows: 1 Crossing is indispensable for any nervous \"sensati on,'' thus for all consciousness. That we see this crossing applied in their mentalit y again suggests that the ancient Egyptians had a profound knowledge of the human bod y and the nervous system. 112"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"We become aware—that is to say, we can qualify a th ing or an idea—only by means of comparison.

This reasoning of absurdity however, underlies any philosophy of Unity—that is to say, \"God.\" Within this Non-being of Nature, which comprises all \"things,\" is summarized like a seed—every- thing that can be. Ancient Egypt accords the entire value to this Caus e and not the object that has emanated from it. When the Ancients draw a figure, it is not the figure they look at, but what they ar e projecting of themselves onto this figure; physically, they view this figure as a shadow, a silhouette against the light of its absen ce. They detect its contours. When they draw a geometrical figure, it is not this figure which interests them, but the inexorable Law that prescri bes it and the inevitable consequence that this law provokes. Thus , geometry takes on the same living characteristic of life as the images they carve or draw.

I will say: to create is to make something from not hing; thus, this nothing is virtually this thing. The created t hing will be the negation of nothing, the affirmation of the corpore al form. To negate this nothing is to pass from the virtual to the actual. But the negation of nothing is absurd; hence negation can o nly apply to the thing which is transitory, which is able not to be. Thus, the nega- tion of the present bodily form is the affirmation of its virtual, indcstructable reality. That which is, is able \"not to be\" in its present f orm; but its Idea, or virtual reality, does not cease to be, as a possibility, imma- nent in the general Cause whence the whole emanates .

Mackay 1 notes that in Egyptian Quadrature a line passes in front of the ear and back knee, and ends, on the ba se line, at a point located one square behind the big toe of the back foot. Another important line, immediately in front of the preceding one, passes through the middle of the iris of the eye an d ends at the big toe of the back foot. The line that passes in front of the car is thus fo und on the static axis of the standing and walking man. On this line are the semicir- cular canals of the inner ear in which are located the sense of orien- tation and stability. The axis of movement passes through the eye: the ey es are luminaries, the eyes guide. One goes toward what on e is looking at, and it is on the big toe of the back foot that one places one's weight in order to advance. 1 E.

The second divides the height of the entire man in 22 units, or sometimes 22 and a fraction. The multiplicity of other divisions are not to be t rusted. They have nothing to do with the canon; their aim is to locate measures, or they serve as symbols. In certain instances—as i n the division by 7 units—it is a matter of simplification for the pl acement of the outline (when, for example, one wishes to make the total height equal to seven heads). The method of 19 squares, which is quite inconvenie nt for the division of a number of digits that is a multiple o f 24 or 28, is nonetheless the method that corresponds best to geo metrical con- struction with phi and provides the explanation of the pharaonic canon. A square is constructed whose side equals the heigh t of the man including the crown of the skull; this height count s as 19 (see fig. 45). The crown of the skull which counts as 1, is then r emoved; there remain 18 for the height, excluding the crown. To the width of the square is added the height of t he crown, giv- ing the fathom—that is, 20 units. Then, to determine the personage's navel, the heigh t is considered as if it were that of the man including the crown; this height of 18 is divided by phi to locate the navel slightly above 1 1 units, starting from the soles of the feet. This is the general scheme, revealed by the use of the number 19; but in reality it is necessary to observe that the coefficient C— that is to say, the value of the crown—is variable and constitutes the personal module. According to the measurements recorded at Luxor, an d based on a great number of other monuments, the quadrature w ould permit only the following measurements to be located almos t uniformly: Length of the foot = 3 units (unit of the widths of the com- position), Height of the knees = 5 1/4 to 6 units (between whi ch is located the kneecap), 2 R.

The measure of the eorporeal man, which gives for t he length of the temple, 140 fathoms, is the man exclu ding the crown of the skull (FP), and would give 142 fathoms for the man including the crown (TP; see fig. 48). 6 2.

Hence, the symphisis pubis should be located halfwa y along the total length TP (measurement verified); this point lies in the thickness of the south wall separating the court of Amenophis III from the colonnade of Amun. This being so, the eye in the pavement is too high for a figure whose geometric outline divides the face into two e qual parts, pass- ing through the upper eyelid. The half-head of 10 f athoms would be located at the midpoint of the eye. However, the entire '\"skeleton\" of the personage co rresponds strictly to the proportions of a man whose height c omprises 7.1 heads, as is shown in plates based on medical data (see fig. 1-2). It is indeed this measurement, FM, that governs the general plan. 2. In considering only the head in relation to the rest of the temple, we are dealing, then, with a man whose head , slightly too large, gives precisely the proportion of a boy befo re puberty, who has reached the age of 12 at the maximum. This is confirmed by the fact that the King is repr esented as a child (between 7 and 12 years) with his mother only in sanctuary 7, where the pineal gland is located. It is this gl and which changes at this age, with the awakening of the intelligence in harmony with the sexual apparatus, in order to pass from the \"pi neal eye\" phase into the epiphysis state. 7 Moreover, this temple is said to be the one in whic h the King spent his childhood.

The third stage of the construction adds the nave, and the child is then 7 or 8 years old—the \"age of respiration,\" says Thooris; thus, the capitals of the columns of the nave are o pen corollas. Amenophis III ceased construction at this point. Ra mses added on the court and the pylons; and there we find the final phases of construction. Toward 12 years, the child attains about five-sixth s of his future height, which brings us to the west door of the cou rt of Ramses. The dimension of the head of this 12-year-old child is indicated on the plan by the length FM, and the ratio between the head and the height of the child (FJ) is 6.481. 10 It should be noted that it is by the west door of t he court of Ramses that both the barque and the princes enter t he temple, as the bas-reliefs indicate.

This measurement is so close to the geodetic datum that one might be led astray. However, the point here is not a geodetic c alculation; we are in fact con- fronted with a coincidence—probably intentional.

The second king (B) has two very clearly determined measure- ments of height: from the ground to the vertex, and from the ground to the head of the uraeus. In addition, the outlines of two superimposed faces can be seen: the original profil e of the head was rectified in such a way that the old profile subsis ts as evidence and as a point of comparison with the new profile (figs . 51 and 52). The original face gave the profile a size correspon ding to 6.5 heads within the total height, hence the proportion s of a 12-year- old child; the rectified profile reduces the size o f the face, which is then contained 7.1 times in the height defined by t he uraeus, and 128"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"the proportion becomes that of an adult man of 18, according to the Egyptian canon.

This unit multiplied by 19 gives the height of the 18-year-ol d man, and consequently the length of the temple (TP).
