May 1979 #74-1120 Security It is patently impossible to discuss social engineering or the au tomation of a society, i.e., the engineering of social automati on systems (silent weapons) on a national or worldwide scale without implying extens ive objectives of social control and destruction of human life, i.e., slavery and genocide. This manual is in itself an analog declarati on of intent. Such a writing must be secured from public scrutiny. Otherwise, it might be recognized as a technically formal declaration of domestic war. Furthermore, whenever any person or group of persons in a position of great power and without full knowledge and consent of the public, uses such knowledge and methodologies for economic conquest - it must be understood that a state of domestic warfare exists between said person or group of persons and the public. The solution of today's problems requires an approach which is ruthlessly candid, with no agonizing over religious, moral or cultural values. You have qualified for this project because of your ability to look at human society with cold objectivity, and yet analyze a nd discuss your observati ons and conclusions with others of similar intellectual capacity without the loss of discretion or humility. Such virtues are exercised in your own best interest. Do not deviate from them. Historical Introduction Silent weapon technology has evolved from Operations Research (O.R.), a strategic and tactical methodology developed under the Military Management in England during World War II. The original purpose of Opera tions Research was to study the strategic and tactical problems of air and land defense with the obj ective of effective use of limited military resources against foreign enemies (i.e., logistics). It was soon recognized by those in positions of power that the same methods might be"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"useful for totally controlling a soci ety. But better tools were necessary. Social engineering (the analysis and automa tion of a society) requi res the correlation of great amounts of constantly changing ec onomic information (data), so a high-speed computerized data-processing system was n ecessary which could race ahead of the society and predict when society would arrive for capitulation. Relay computers were to slow, but the el ectronic computer, invented in 1946 by J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly, filled the bill. The next breakthrough was the development of the simplex method of linear programming in 1947 by the mathematician George B. Dantzig. Then in 1948, the transistor, invented by J. Bardeen, W.H. Brattain, and W. Shockley, promised great expansion of the computer field by reducing space and power requirements. With these three inventions under their direction, those in positions of power strongly suspected that it was possible for them to control the whole world with the push of a button. Immediately, the Rockefeller Foundation got in on the ground floor by making a four- year grant to Harvard College, funding the Harvard Economic Research Project for the study of the structure of the American Economy. One year later, in 1949, The United States Air Force joined in. In 1952 the grant period terminated, and a high- level meeting of the Elite was held to determine the next phase of social operations research. The Harvard project had been very fruitful, as is borne out by the publica tion of some of its results in 1953 suggesting the feasibility of economi c (social) engineering. ( Studies in the Structure of the American Economy - copyright 1953 by Wassily Leontie f, International Science Press Inc., White Plains, New York). Engineered in the last half of the decade of the 1940's, the new Quiet War machine stood, so to speak, in sparkling gold-plated hardware on the showroom floor by 1954. With the creation of the maser in 1954, the promise of unlocking unlimited sources of fusion atomic energy from the heavy hydr ogen in sea water and the consequent availability of unlimited social power was a possibility only decades away. The combination was irresistible. The Quiet War was quietly declared by the International Elite at a meeting held in 1954. Although the silent weapons system was nearly exposed 13 years later, the evolution of the new weapon-system has never suffered any major setbacks. This volume marks the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the Quiet War. Already"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"this domestic war has had many victor ies on many fronts throughout the world. Political Introduction In 1954 it was well recognized by those in pos itions of authority that it was only a matter of time, only a few decades, before the general public would be able to grasp and upset the cradle of pow er, for the very elements of the new silent-weapon technology were as accessible for a public ut opia as they were for providing a private utopia. The issue of primary concern, that of domi nance, revolved around the subject of the energy sciences. Energy Energy is recognized as the key to all activ ity on earth. Natural sc ience is the study of the sources and control of natu ral energy, and social science, theoretically expressed as economics, is the study of the sources a nd control of social energy. Both are bookkeeping systems: mathematics. Therefore, mathematics is the primary energy science. And the bookkeeper can be king if th e public can be kept ignorant of the methodology of the bookkeeping. All science is merely a means to an end. The means is knowledge. The end is control. Beyond this remains only one issue: Who will be the beneficiary? In 1954 this was the issue of primary con cern. Although the so-called \"moral issues\" were raised, in view of the law of natural selection it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no better than animals who do not have intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the table by choice and consent. Consequently, in the interest of future world order, peace, and tranquillity, it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against the American public with an ultimate objective of permanently shif ting the natural and social energy (wealth) of the undisciplined and irresponsible many into the hands of the self-dis ciplined, responsible, and worthy few. In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure, and apply new weapons which, as it turned out, were a class of weapons so subtle and sophisticated in their principle of operation and public appearan ce as to earn for themselves the name \"silent weapons.\" In conclusion, the objective of economic research, as conducted by the magnates of capital (banking) a nd the industries of commodities (goods) and services, is the establishment of an economy which is totally predictable and manipulatable. In order to achieve a totally predictable economy, the low-class elements of society must be brought under total control, i.e., must be housebroken, trained, and assigned a yoke and long-term social duties from a ve ry early age, before they have an"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"opportunity to question the propriety of the matter. In order to achieve such conformity, the lower-class family unit must be disintegrated by a process of increasing preoccupation of the parents and the estab lishment of government-operated day-care centers for the occupationally orphaned children. The quality of education given to the lower cl ass must be of the poorest sort, so that the moat of ignorance isolating the inferior clas s from the superior class is and remains incomprehensible to the inferior class. With such an initial handi cap, even bright lower class individuals have little if any hope of extricating th emselves from their assigned lot in life. This form of slavery is essentia l to maintain some measure of social order, peace, and tranquillity for the ruling upper class. Descriptive Introduction of the Silent Weapon Everything that is expected from an ordina ry weapon is expected from a silent weapon by its creators, but only in its own manner of functioning. It shoots situations, instead of bullets; propelled by data pr ocessing, instead of chemical reaction (explosion); originating from bits of data, instead of grains of gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a gun; operate d by a computer programmer, instead of a marksman; under the orders of a banking magn ate, instead of a military general. It makes no obvious explosive noises, cause s no obvious physical or mental injuries, and does not obviously interfere with anyone's daily social life. Yet it makes an unmistakable \"noise,\" causes unmistakable physical and mental damage, and unmistakably interferes with th e daily social life, i. e., unmistakable to a trained observer, one who knows what to look for. The public cannot comprehend this weapon, and therefore cannot believe that they are being attacked and subdued by a weapon. The public might instinctively feel that some thing is wrong, but that is because of the technical nature of the silent weapon, they cannot express their feeling in a rational way, or handle the problem with intelligence. Therefore, they do not know how to cry for help, and do not know how to associate with others to defend themselves against it. When a silent weapon is applie d gradually, the public adjusts/ adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment on thei r lives until the pressure (psychological via economic) becomes too great and they crack up. Therefore, the silent weapon is a type of biological warfare. It attacks the vitality, options, and mobility of the individu als of a society by knowing, understanding, manipulating, and attacking their sources of natural and social energy, and their physical, mental, and emotional strengths and weaknesses.

Mr. Rothschild discovered the mi ssing passive component of economic theory known as economic inductance. He, of course, did not think of his discovery in these 20th-century terms, and, to be sure, mathematical analysis had to wait for the Second Industrial Revolution, th e rise of the theory of m echanics and electronics, and finally, the invention of the el ectronic computer before it could be effectively applied in the control of the world economy. General Energy Concepts In the study of energy systems, there always appears three elementary concepts. These are potential energy, kinetic energy, a nd energy dissipation. And corresponding to these concepts, there are three idealized, es sentially pure physic al counterparts called passive components. 1. In the science of physical mechanics, the phenomenon of potential energy is associated with a physical property calle d elasticity or stiffness, and can be represented by a stretched spring. In electronic science, potential energy is stored in a capacitor instead of a spring. This property is called capacitance in stead of elasticity or stiffness. 2. In the science of physical mechanics, the phenomenon of kinetic energy is associated with a physical property called inertia or mass, and can be represented by a mass or a flywheel in motion. In electronic science, ki netic energy is stored in an inductor (in a magnetic field) instead of a mass. This property is called inductance instead of inertia. 3. In the science of physical mechanics, the phenomenon of energy dissipation is associated with a physical property calle d friction or resistance, and can be represented by a dashpot or other devi ce which converts energy into heat. In electronic science, dissipation of energy is performed by an element called either a resistor or a cond uctor, the term \"resistor\" being the one generally used to describe a more ideal device (e.g., wire) employed to convey electronic energy efficiently from one location to a nother. The property of a resistance or conductor is measured as either resi stance or conductance reciprocals. In economics these three energy c oncepts are asso ciated with: 1. Economic Capacitance - Capital (money, stock /inventory, investments in buildings and durables, etc.) 2. Economic Conductance - Goods (production flow coefficients)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"3. Economic Inductance - Services (the influence of the population of industry on output) All of the mathematical theory develope d in the study of one energy system (e.g., mechanics, electronics, etc.) can be immedi ately applied in the study of any other energy system (e.g., economics). Mr. Rothchild's Energy Discovery What Mr. Rothschild had discovered was the basic principle of power, influence, and control over people as applie d to economics. That princi ple is \"when you assume the appearance of power, peopl e soon give it to you.\" Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currenc y or deposit loan accounts had the required appearance of power that could be used to induce people (inductance, with people corresponding to a magnetic field) into surre ndering their real wealth in exchange for a promise of greater wealth (instead of r eal compensation). They would put up real collateral in exchange for a loan of prom issory notes. Mr. Rothschild found that he could issue more notes than he had backing for, so long as he had someone's stock of gold as a persuader to show his customers. Mr. Rothschild loaned his promissory notes to individual and to governments. These would create overconfidence. Then he would make money scarce, tighten control of the system, and collect the colla teral through the obligation of contracts. The cycle was then repeated. These pressures could be used to ignite a war. Then he would control the availability of currency to determine who would win the war. That government which agreed to give him control of its economic system got his support. Collection of debts was guaranteed by economic aid to the enemy of the debtor. The profit derived from this economic methodology mad Mr. Rothschild all the more able to expand his wealth. He found that the public greed would allow currency to be printed by government order beyond the limits (inflation) of backing in precious metal or the production of goods and services. Apparent Capital as \"Paper\" Inductor In this structure, credit, presented as a pure element called \"currency,\" has the appearance of capital, but is in effect negati ve capital. Hence, it has the appearance of service, but is in fact, in debtedness or debt. It is th erefore an economic inductance instead of an economic capacitance, and if ba lanced in no other way, will be balanced by the negation of population (war, genocide) . The total goods and services represent real capital called the gross national product, and currency may be printed up to this level and still represent econom ic capacitance; but currency printed beyond this level is subtractive, represents the introduction of economic inducta nce, and constitutes notes of indebtedness. War is therefore the balancing of the syst em by killing the true creditors (the public which we have taught to exchange true valu e for inflated currency) and falling back on"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"whatever is left of the resources of natu re and regeneration of those resources. Mr. Rothschild had discovered that curre ncy gave him the power to rearrange the economic structure to his own advantage, to shift economic inductance to those economic positions which would encourage the greatest economic instability and oscillation. The final key to economic control had to wa it until there was suffi cient data and high- speed computing equipment to keep close watch on the economic oscillations created by price shocking and excess paper energy credits - paper inductance/inflation. Breakthrough The aviation field provided the greatest e volution in economic engineering by way of the mathematical theory of s hock testing. In this process, a projectile is fired from an airframe on the ground and the impulse of the recoil is monitored by vibration transducers connected to the airframe and wired to chart recorders. By studying the echoes or reflections of the r ecoil impulse in the airframe, it is possible to discover critical vibrations in the structure of the airfra me which either vibrations of the engine or aeolian vibrations of the wings, or a combination of the two, might reinforce resulting in a resonant self-destruction of th e airframe in flight as an aircraft. From the standpoint of engineering, this m eans that the strengths and weaknesses of the structure of the airframe in terms of vibrational energy can be discovered and manipulated. Application in Economics To use this method of airframe shock test ing in economic engin eering, the prices of commodities are shocked, and the public consumer reaction is monitored. The resulting echoes of the economic shock are interpre ted theoretically by computers and the psycho-economic structure of the economy is t hus discovered. It is by this process that partial differential and difference matrices are discovered that define the family household and make possible its evaluati on as an economic industry (dissipative consumer structure). Then the response of the household to future shocks can be predicted and manipulated, and society becomes a well-regulated animal with its reins unde r the control of a sophisticated computer-regulated social energy bookkeeping system. Eventually every individual element of the structure comes under computer control through a knowledge of personal preferences , such knowledge guaranteed by computer association of consumer pr eferences (universal product code, UPC; zebra-striped pricing codes on packages) with identified consumers (ident ified via association with the use of a credit card a nd later a permanent \"tattooed\" body number invisible under normal ambient illumination)."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Summary Economics is only a social extension of a na tural energy system. It, also, has its three passive components. Because of the dist ribution of wealth and the lack of communication and lack of data, this field has been the last energy field for which a knowledge of these three passive components has been developed. Since energy is the key to all activity on the face of the earth, it follo ws that in order to attain a monopoly of energy, raw materials, goods, and services and to establixh a world system of slave labor, it is necessary to have a first strike ca pability in the field of economics. In order to maintain our positi on, it is necessary that we have absolute first knowledge of the science of control over all economic factors and the first experience at engineering the world economy. In order to achieve such sovereignty, we mu st at least achieve this one end: that the public will not make either the logical or mathematical connec tion between economics and the other energy sciences or learn to apply such knowledge. This is becoming increasingly difficult to control because more and more businesses are making demands upon their computer programmers to create and apply mathematical models for the management of those businesses. It is only a matter of time before the ne w breed of private programmer/economists will catch on to the far reaching implications of the work begun at Harvard in 1948. The speed with which they can communicate thei r warning to the public will largely depend upon how effective we have been at contro lling the media, subverting education, and keeping the public distra cted with matters of no real importance. The Economic Model Economics, as a social energy science has as a first objective the description of the complex way in which any given unit of resources is used to satisfy some economic want. (Leontief Matrix). This first objectiv e, when it is extended to get the most product from the least or limited resources, co mprises that objectiv e of general military and industrial logistics known as Operati ons Research. (See simplex method of linear programming.) The Harvard Economic Research Project (1948-) was an extension of World War II Operations Research . Its purpose was to discover the science of controlling an economy: at first the Americ an economy, and then the world economy. It was felt that with sufficient mathematical foundation and data , it would be nearly as easy to predict and control the trend of an economy as to predict and control th e trajectory of a projectile. Such has proven to be th e case. Moreover, the economy has been transformed into a guided missile on target. The immediate aim of the Harvard project was to discover the economic structure, what forces change that structure, how the behavior of the structure can be predicted, and how it can be manipulated. What was n eeded was a well-organized knowledge of the mathematical structures and inte rrelationships of investment, production,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"distribution, and consumption. To make a short story of it all, it was discovered that an economy obeyed the same laws as electricity and that all of the mathematical theory and practical and computer know-how developed for the electronic field co uld be directly applied in the study of economics. This discovery was not openly de clared, and its more subtle implications were and are kept a closely guarded secret , for example that in an economic model, human life is measured in dollars, and that the electric spark generated when opening a switch connected to an active inductor is ma thematically analogous to the initiation of war. The greatest hurdle which theoretical economis ts faced was the accurate description of the household as an industry. This is a ch allenge because consumer purchases are a matter of choice which in turn is influe nced by income, price, and other economic factors. This hurdle was cleared in an indirect and statistically approximate way by an application of shock testing to determine the current characteristics, called current technical coefficients, of a household industry Finally, because problems in theoretical electro nics can be translated very easily into problems of theoretical electr onics, and the solution translated back again, it follows that only a book of language translation and concept definition needed to be written for economics. The remainder could be gotten from standard works on mathematics and electronics. This makes the publication of books on advanced economics unnecessary, and greatly simplifies project security. Industrial Diagrams An ideal industry is defined as a device wh ich receives value from other industries in several forms and converts them into one sp ecific product for sales and distribution to other industries. It has seve ral inputs and one output. What the public normally thinks of as one industry is really an industria l complex, where several industries under one roof produce one or more products. A pure (single output) industry can be repr esented oversimply by a circuit block as follows: The flow of product from industry #1 (suppl y) to industry #2 (demand) is denoted by 1 12 . The total flow out of i ndustry \"K\" is denoted by I k (sales, etc.). A three industry network can be diagrammed as follows:"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" A node is a symbol of collection and dist ribution of flow. Node #3 receives from industry #3 and distributes to industries #1 and #3. If i ndustry #3 manufactures chairs, then a flow from industry #3 back to industr y #3 simply indicates that industry #3 is using part of its own output product, for ex ample, as office furniture. Therefore the flow may be summarized by the equations: Three Industrial Classes Industries fall into thr ee categories or classes by type of output: 1. Class #1 - Capital (resources) 2. Class #2 - Goods (commodities or use - dissipative) 3. Class #3 - Services (action of population) • Class #1 industries exist at three levels: 1. Nature - sources of energy and raw materials. 2. Government - printing of currency equal to the gross national product (GNP), and extension of currency in excess of GNP. 3. Banking - loaning of money fo r interest, and extension (inflation/counterfeiting) of econo mic value through the deposit loan accounts. • Class #2 industries exist as producers of tangible or consumer (dissipated) products. This sort of activity is usuall y recognized and labeled by the public as"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"\"industry.\" • Class #3 industries are those which have service rather than a tangible product as their output. These industries are cal led (1) households, and (2) governments. Their output is human activity of a m echanical sort, and their basis is population. Aggregation The whole economic system can be represented by a three-industry model if one allows the names of the outputs to be (1) capital, (2) goods, and (3) services. The problem with this representation is th at it would not show the influe nce, say, the te xtile industry on the ferrous metal industry. This is because both the textile i ndustry and the ferrous metal industry would be contained within a single classification called the \"goods industry\" and by this process of combining or aggregating these two industries under one system block they would lose their economic individuality. The E-Model A national economy consists of simulta neous flows of production, distribution, consumption, and investment. If all of these elements including labor and human functions are assigned a numerical value in like units of measur e, say, 1939 dollars, then this flow can be further represented by a current flow in an el ectronic circuit, and its behavior can be predicted and ma nipulated with useful precision. The three ideal passive energy components of electronics, the capacitor, the resistor, and the inductor correspond to the three id eal passive energy components of economics called the pure industries of c apital, goods, and serv ices, respectively. • Economic capacitance represents the storage of capital in one form or another. • Economic conductance represents the leve l of conductance of materials for the production of goods. • Economic inductance represents the iner tia of economic value in motion. This is a population phenomenon known as services. Economic Inductance An electrical inductor (e.g., a coil or wire) has an electr ic current as its primary phenomenon and a magnetic field as its secondary phenomenon (inertia). Corresponding to this, an economic inductor has a flow of economic value as its primary phenomenon and a population field as its secondary field phenomenon of inertia. When the flow of economic va lue (e.g., money) diminishes, the human population field collapses in order to k eep the economic value (money) flowing (extreme case - war). This public inertia is a result of consumer buying habits, expected standard of living, etc., and is generally a phe nomenon of self-preservation."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Inductive Factors to Consider 1. Population 2. Magnitude of the economic activities of the government 3. The method of financing these government activities (See Peter-Paul Principle - inflation of the currency.) Translation (a few examples will be given.) • Charge : coulombs; dollars (1939). • Flow/Current : amperes (coulombs per second); dollars of flow per year. • Motivating Force : volts; dollars (output) demand. • Conductance : amperes per volt; dollars of flow per year per dollar demand. • Capacitance : coulombs per volt; dollars of production inventory/stock per dollar demand. Time Flow Relationships and Self-Destructive Oscillations An ideal industry may be symbolized electr onically in various ways. The simplest way is to represent a demand by a voltage and a supply by a current. When this is done, the relationship between the two becomes what is called an admittance, which can result from three economic factors: (1) foresight flow, (2) present flow, and (3) hindsight flow. 1. Foresight flow is the result of that property of living entities to cause energy (food) to be stored for a period of low en ergy (e.g., a winter season). It consists of demands made upon an economic system for that period of low energy (winter season). In a production industry it takes severa l forms, one of which is known as production stock or inventor y. In electronic symbology this specific industry demand (a pure capital industry) is repres ented by capacitance and the stock or resource is represented by a stored charge. Satisfac tion of an industry demand suffers a lag because of the loading effect of inventory priorities. 2. Present flow ideally involves no delays. It is, so to speak, input today for output today, a \"hand to mouth\" flow. In el ectronic symbology, this specific industry demand (a pure us industry) is repres ented by a conductance which is then a simple economic valve (a dissipative element). 3. Hindsight flow is known as habit or inertia. In electronics this phenomenon is the characteristic of an inductor (economi c analog = a pure service industry) in which a current flow (economic analog = flow of money) creates a magnetic field (economic analog = active huma n population) which, if the current (money flow) begins to diminish, collaps e (war) to maintain the current (flow"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"of money - energy). Other large alternatives to war as ec onomic inductors or economic flywheels are an open-ended social welfare program, or an enormous (but fruitful) open- ended space program. The problem with stabilizing the economi c system is that there is too much demand on account of (1) too much gr eed and (2) too much population. This creates excessive economic induct ance which can only be balanced with economic capacitance (true resources or value - e.g., in goods or services). The social welfare program is nothing mo re than an open-ended credit balance system which creates a false capital industry to give nonproductive people a roof over their heads and f ood in their stomachs. This can be useful, however, because the recipients become state prope rty in return for the \"gift,\" a standing army for the elite. For he who pays the piper picks the tune. Those who get hooked on the economic drug, must go to the elite for a fix. In this, the method of introducing large am ounts of stabilizing capacitance is by borrowing on the future \"credit\" of the world. This is a fourth law of motion - onset, and consists of performing an ac tion and leaving the system before the reflected reaction returns to the po int of action - a delayed reaction. The means of surviving the reaction is by changing the system before the reaction can return. By this means, po liticians become more popular in their own time and the public pays later. In f act, the measure of such a politician is the delay time. The same thing is achieved by a government by printing money beyond the limit of the gross national produc t, and economic process called inflation . This puts a large quantity of money into th e hands of the public and maintains a balance against their greed, creates a fa lse self-confidence in them and, for awhile, stays the wolf from the door. They must eventually resort to wa r to balance the account, because war ultimately is merely the act of destroying the creditor, and the politicians are the publicly hired hit men that justify the act to keep the res ponsibility and blood off the public conscience. (See section on consent factors and social-economic structuring.) If the people really cared about thei r fellow man, they would control their appetites (greed, procreati on, etc.) so that they woul d not have to operate on a credit or welfare social system which stea ls from the worker to satisfy the bum.

The general public refuses to improve its own mentality and its faith in its fellow man. It has beco me a herd of proliferating barbarians, and, so to speak, a blight upon the face of the earth. They do not care enough about economic sc ience to learn why they have not been able to avoid war despite religious morality, and their religious or self- gratifying refusal to deal with earthly problems renders the solution of the earthly problem unreachable to them. It is left to those few who are truly willing to think and survive as the fittest to survive, to solve the problem for them selves as the few who really care.

The problem which a theoretical econo mist faces is that the consumer preferences of any household is not ea sily predictable and the technical coefficients of any one household tend to be a nonlinear, very complex, and variable function of income, prices, etc. Computer information derived from the use of the universal product code in conjuction with credit-car d purchase as an individua l household identifier could change this state of affa irs, but the U.P.C. method is not yet available on a national or even a significant regional scale. To compensate for this data deficiency, an alternate indirect appro ach of analysis has been adopted known as economic shock testing. This method, widely used in the aircraft manufacturing industry, develops an a ggregate statistical sort of data. Applied to economics, this means that all of the households in one region or in the whole nation are studied as a group or class rather than individually, and the mass behavior rather than the individual behavior is used to discover useful estimates of the technical coefficients governing the economic structure of the hypothetical single-household industry.

Economic Shock Testing In recent times, the application of Operations Research to the study of the public economy has been obvious for anyone who understands the principles of shock testing. In the shock testing of an aircraft ai rframe, the recoil impulse of firing a gun mounted on that airframe causes shock waves in that structure which tell aviation engineers the conditions under whic h some parts of the airplane or the whole airplane or its wings will start to vibrate or flutter like a guitar string, a flute reed, or a tuning fo rk, and disintegrate or fall apart in flight. Economic engineers achieve the same re sult in studying the behavior of the economy and the consumer public by caref ully selecting a staple commodity such as beef, coffee, gasoline, or suga r, and then causing a sudden change or shock in its price or availability, thus kicking everybody's budget and buying habits out of shape. They then observe the shock waves which result by monitoring the changes in advertising, prices, and sales of that and other commodities. The objective of such studies is to ac quire the know-how to set the public economy into a predictable state of moti on or change, even a controlled self- destructive state of motion which will c onvince the public that certain \"expert\" people should take control of the money system and reestablish security (rather than liberty and justice) for all. When the subject citizens are rendered unable to control their financial affairs, they, of course, become totally enslaved, a source of cheap labor. Not only the prices of commodities, but al so the availability of labor can be used as the means of shock testing. Labor strikes deliver excellent tests shocks to an economy, especially in the critical service areas of trucking (transportation), communication, public utilities (ener gy, water, garbage collection), etc. By shock testing, it is found that ther e is a direct relationship between the availability of money flowing in an economy and the real psychological outlook and response of masses of people de pendent upon that availability. For example, there is a measurable qua ntitative relationship between the price of gasoline and the probabili ty that a person would expe rience a headache, feel a need to watch a violent movie, smoke a cigarette, or go to a tavern for a mug of beer. It is most interesting that, by observi ng and measuring the economic models by"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"which the public tries to run from their problems and escape from reality, and by applying the mathem atical theory of Operations Research , it is possible to program computers to predict the most probable combination of created events (shocks) which will bring about a comp lete control and subjugation of the public through a subversion of the public economy (by shaking the plum tree). Introduction to the Theory of Economic Shock Testing Let the prices and total sales of commodities be given and symbolized as follows: Commodities Price Function Total Sales alcoholic beverages A A beef B B coffee C C gasoline G G sugar S S tobacco T T unknown balance U U Let us assume a simple economic model in which the total number of important (staple) commodities are represented as b eef, gasoline, and an aggregate of all other staple commodities which we w ill call the hypothetical miscellaneous staple commodity 'M' (e.g., M is an aggregate of C, S, T, U, etc.). Example of Shock Testing Assume that the total sales, P, of pe troleum products can be described by the linear function of the quantities B, G, a nd M, which are functions of the prices of those respective commodities. P = a PG B + a PG G + a PM M Then where B, G, and M are functions of the prices of beef, gasoline, and miscellaneous, respectively, and a PB , a PG , and a PM are constant coefficients defining the amount by which each of the functions B, G, and M affect the sales, P, of petroleum products. We are assuming that B, G, and M are variables independent of each other. If the availability or pr ice of gasoline is suddenly changed, then G must be replaced by G + G. This causes a change in the petroleum sales from P to P + P. Also we will assume that B and M re main constant when G changes to G + G."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"(P + P) = a PB B + a PG (G + G) + a PM M. Expanding upon this expression, we get P + P = a PB B + a PG G + a PG G + a PM M and subtracting the original value of P we get for the change in P Change in P = P = a PG G Dividing by G we get a PG = P / G . This is a rate of change in P due only to an isolated change in G, G. In general, a jk is the partial rate of change in th e sales effect j due to a change in the causal price function of commodity k.

There are other factors which may be represented the same way. For example, the tendency of a docile sub-nation to withdraw under economic pressure may be given by where G is the price of gasoline, W P is the dollars spent per unit time"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"(referenced to say 1939) for war production during 'peace' time, etc. These quantities are presented to a computer in matrix format as follows: and X 1 = G Y 1 = P - K P X 2 = B Y 2 = F - K F X 3 = etc. Y 3 = etc. Finally, inverting this matr ix, i.e., solving for the X k terms of the Y j , we get, say, [ b kj ] [ Y j ] = [ X k ] .

Introduction to Economic Amplifiers Economic amplifiers are the active com ponents of economic engineering. The b asic characteristic of any amplifier (mechanical, electrical, or economic) is that it receives an input control signal and delivers energy from an independent"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"energy source to a specified output terminal in a predictable relationship to that input control signal. The simplest form of an economic amp lifier is a device ca lled advertising. If a person is spoken to by a T.V. advert iser as if he were a twelve-year-old, then, due to suggestibility, he will, w ith a certain probability, respond or react to that suggestion with th e uncritical response of a twelve-year-old and will reach into his economic reservoir and de liver its energy to but that product on impulse when he passes it in the store. An economic amplifier may have severa l inputs and output. It s response might be instantaneous or delayed. Its circuit sy mbol might be a rotary switch if its options are exclusive, qualitative, \"go\" or \"no-go\", or it might have its parametric input/output rela tionships specified by a matrix with internal energy sources represented. Whatever its form might be, its purpose is to govern the flow of energy from a source to an output sink in direct relationship to an input control signal. For this reason, it is called an active circuit element or component. Economic Amplifiers fall into classes cal led strategies, and, in comparison with electronic amplifiers, the sp ecific internal functions of an economic amplifier are called logistical in stead of electrical. Therefore, economic amplifiers not only deliver power gain but also, in effect, are used to cause changes in the economic circuitry. In the design of an economic amplifier we must have some idea of at least five functions, which are: 8. the available input signals 9. the desired output-control objectives, 10. the strategic objective, 11. the available economic power sources, 12. the logistical options. The process of defining and evaluating these factors and incorporating the economic amplifier into an economic system has been popularly called game theory . The design of an economic amplifier begi ns with a specification of the power level of the output, which can range fr om personal to national. The second condition is accuracy of response, i.e ., how accurately the output action is a function of the input commands. High gain combined with strong feedback helps to deliver the required precision. Most of the error will be in the input data signal.

This is achieved by: o disengaging their minds; sabotaging th eir mental activities; providing a low-quality program of public educati on in mathematics, logic, systems design and economics; and discour aging technical creativity. o engaging their emotions, increasing their self-indulgence and their indulgence in emotional and physical activities, by:  unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional rape) by way of constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media - especially the T.V. and the newspapers."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" giving them what they desire - in excess - \"junk food for thought\" - and depriving them of what they really need. o rewriting history and law and subj ecting the public to the deviant creation, thus being able to shift th eir thinking from personal needs to highly fabricated outside priorities. These preclude their interest in and discovery of the silent weapons of social automation technology. The general rule is that there is a prof it in confusion; the more confusion, the more profit. Therefore, the best appro ach is to create problems and then offer solutions. Diversion Summary Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real social issues, and captivated by matte rs of no real importance. Schools: Keep the young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics, real law, and real history. Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment below a sixth-grade level. Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, w ith no time to think; back on the farm with the other animals. Consent, the Primary Victory A silent weapon system operates upon data obtained from a docile public by legal (but not always lawf ul) force. Much information is made available to silent weapon systems programmers thr ough the Internal Revenue Service. (See Studies in the Structur e of the American Economy for an I.R.S. source list.) This information consists of the enfo rced delivery of well-organized data contained in federal and state tax form s, collected, assembled, and submitted by slave labor provided by ta xpayers and employers. Furthermore, the number of such forms submitted to the I.R.S. is a useful indicator of public consent, an importa nt factor in strategic decision making. Other data sources are given in the Short List of Inputs. Consent Coefficients - numerical fe edback indicating victory status.

A good and easily quantified indicator of harvest time is the number of public"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"citizens who pay income tax despite an obvious lack of reciprocal or honest service from the government. Amplification Energy Sources The next step in the process of design ing an economic amplifier is discovering the energy sources. The energy sources which support any primitive economic system are, of course, a supply of raw materials, and the consent of the people to labor and consequently assume a certa in rank, position, level, or class in the social structure, i.e., to provide labor at va rious levels in the pecking order. Each class, in guaranteeing its own le vel of income, controls the class immediately below it, hence preserves the class structure. This provides stability and security, but al so government from the top. As time goes on and communication and education improve, the lower-class elements of the social labor structure become knowledgeable and envious of the good things that the upper-class members have. They also begin to attain a knowledge of energy systems and the abil ity to enforce their rise through the class structure. This threatens the sovereignty of the elite. If this rise of the lower classes can be postponed long enough, the elite can achieve energy dominance, and labor by consent no longer will hold a position of an essential energy source. Until such energy dominance is absolutely established, the consent of people to labor and let others handle their affairs must be taken into consideration, since failure to do so could cause the people to interfere in the final transfer of energy sources to the cont rol of the elite. It is essential to recognize that at this time, public consent is still an essential key to the release of energy in the process of economic amplification. Therefore, consent as an energy release mechanism will now be considered. Logistics The successful application of a strate gy requires a careful study of inputs, outputs, the strategy connecting the input s and the outputs, and the available energy sources to fuel the strategy. This study is called logistics. A logistical problem is studi ed at the elementary level first, and then levels of greater complexity are studied as a synthesis of elementary factors. This means that a given system is analyzed, i.e., broken down into its subsystems, and these in turn are analyze d, until by this process, one arrives at"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the logistical \"atom,\" the individual. This is where the process of synthesis prope ry begins, at the time of birth of the individual. The Artificial Womb From the time a person leaves its mother's womb, its every effort is directed towards building, maintaining, and withdr awing into artificial wombs, various sorts of substitute protective devices or shells. The objective of these artificial wombs is to provide a stable environment for both stable and unstable ac tivity; to provide a shelter for the evolutionary processes of growth and maturity - i. e., survival; to provide security for freedom and to provide defensive protection for offensive activity. This is equally true of both the general public and the elite. However, there is a definite difference in the way each of these classes go about the solution of problems. The Political Structure of a Nation - Dependency The primary reason why the individual ci tizens of a country create a political structure is a subconscious wish or desi re to perpetuate their own dependency relationship of childhood. Simply put, th ey want a human god to eliminate all risk from their life, pat them on the h ead, kiss their bruises, put a chicken on every dinner table, clothe their bodies, tu ck them into bed at night, and tell them that everything will be alright when they wake up in the morning. This public demand is incredible, so the human god, the politician, meets incredibility with incredibility by promising the world and delivering nothing. So who is the bigger liar? th e public? or the \"godfather\"? This public behavior is surre nder born of fear, laziness, and expediency. It is the basis of the welfare state as a strate gic weapon, useful against a disgusting public. Action/Offense Most people want to be able to subdue and/or kill other human beings which disturb their daily lives, but they do not want to have to cope with the moral and religious issues which such an overt act on their part might raise. Therefore, they assign the dirty work to others (inc luding their own children) so as to keep the blood off their hands. They rave about the humane treatment of animals and then sit down to a delicious hamburge r from a whitewashed slaughterhouse down the street and out of sight. But ev en more hypocritical, they pay taxes to finance a professional association of hit men collectively call ed politicians, and"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"then complain about corruption in government. Responsibility Again, most people want to be free to do the things (to explore, etc.) but they are afraid to fail. The fear of failure is manifested in ir responsibility, and espe cially in delegating those personal responsibilit ies to others where succe ss is uncertain or carries possible or created liabilities (law) whic h the person is not prepared to accept. They want authority (root word - \"author\"), but they will not accept responsibility or liability. So they hire politicians to face reality for them. Summary The people hire the politicians so that the people can: o obtain security wit hout managing it. o obtain action without thinking about it. o inflict theft, injury, a nd death upon others without having to contemplate either life or death. o avoid responsibility for their own intentions. o obtain the benefits of reality and sc ience without exerting themselves in the discipline of facing or lear ning either of these things. They give the politicians the power to create and manage a war machine to: o provide for the survival of the nation/womb. o prevent encroachment of anything upon the nation/womb. o destroy the enemy who threatens the nation/womb. o destroy those citizens of their own country who do not conform for the sake of stability of the nation/womb. Politicians hold many quasi-military jobs , the lowest being the police which are soldiers, the attorneys and C.P.A.s next who are spies and saboteurs (licensed), and the judges who shout orders and run the closed union military shop for whatever the market will bear. The generals are industrialists. The \"presidential\" level of commander-in-ch ief is shared by the international bankers. The people know that they have cr eated this farce and financed it with their own taxes (consent), but they w ould rather knuckle under than be the hypocrite. Thus, a nation becomes divided into two ve ry distinct parts, a docile sub-nation [great silent majority] and a politic al sub-nation. The po litical sub-nation remains attached to the docile sub-nation, tolerates it, and leaches its substance until it grows strong enough to detach itself and then devour its parent."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"System Analysis In order to make meaningful computer ized economic decisions about war, the primary economic flywheel, it is necessary to assign concrete logistical values to each element of the war structur e - personnel and material alike. This process begins with a clear and ca ndid description of the subsystems of such a structure. The Draft (As military service) Few efforts of human behavior modifi cation are more remarkable or more effective than that of the socio-milit ary institution known as the draft. A primary purpose of a draft or other such institution is to ins till, by intimidation, in the young males of a society the uncri tical conviction that the government is omnipotent. He is soon taught that a prayer is slow to reverse what a bullet can do in an instant. Thus, a man trained in a religious environment for eighteen years of his life can, by this instrument of the government, be broken down, be purged of his fantasies and delusions in a matter of mere months. Once that conviction is instilled, all else becomes easy to instill. Even more interesting is the proc ess by which a young man's parents, who purportedly love him, can be induced to send him off to war to his death. Although the scope of this work will not allow this matter to be expanded in full detail, nevertheless, a coarse overv iew will be possible and can serve to reveal those factors which must be in cluded in some numerical form in a computer analysis of social and war systems. We begin with a tentative definition of the draft. 4. The draft (selective service, etc.) is an institution of compulsory collective sacrifice and slavery, devised by the middl e-aged and elderly for the purpose of pressing the young into doing the public dirt y work. It further serves to make the youth as guilty as the elders, thus making criticism of the elders by the youth less likely (Generationa l Stabilizer). It is mark eted and and sold to the public under the label of \"patriotic = national\" service. Once a candid economic definition of the draft is achieved, that definition is used to outline the boundaries of a structure called a Hu man Value System, which in turn is translated into the terms of game theory. The value of such a slave laborer is given in a Table of Human Values, a table broken down into categories by intellect, experience, post-service job demand, etc. Some of these categories are ordinary a nd can be tentatively evaluated in terms of the value of certain jobs for which a known fee exists. Some jobs are harder to value because they are unique to th e demands of social subversion, for an extreme example: the value of a mother 's instruction to her daughter, causing that daughter to put certain behavior al demands upon a future husband ten or fifteen years hence; thus , by suppressing his resistance to a perversion of a"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"government, making it easier for a banking cartel to buy the State of New York in, say, twenty years. Such a problem leans heavily upon the observations and data of wartime espionage and many types of psychologi cal testing. But crude mathematical models (algorithms, etc.) can be devise d, if not to predict, at least to predeterminate these events with ma ximum certainty. What does not exist by natural cooperation is th us enhanced by calculated compulsion. Human beings are machines, levers which may be graspe d and turned, and there is little real difference between automating a societ y and automating a shoe factory. These derived values are variable. (It is necessary to use a current Table of Human Values for computer analysis.) Th ese values are given in true measure rather than U.S. dollars, since the latter is unstable, being presently inflated beyond the production of national goods and se rvices so as to give the economy a false kinetic energy (\" paper\" inductance). The silver value is stable, it being possi ble to buy the same amount with a gram of silver today as it could be bought in 1920. Human value measured in silver units changes slightly due to changes in production technology. Enforcement Factor I As in every social system approach, st ability is achieved only by understanding and accounting for human nature (action/r eaction patterns). A failure to do so can be, and usually is, disastrous. As in other human social schemes, one form or another of intimidation (or incentive) is essential to the success of the draft. Physical principles of action and reaction must be applied to both internal and external subsystems. To secure the draft, individual brainw ashing/programming and both the family unit and the peer group must be en gaged and brought under control. Factor II - Father The man of the household must be housebroke n to ensure that junior will grow up with the right social tr aining and attitudes. The a dvertising media, etc., are engaged to see to it that father-to-be is pussy-whipped before or by the time he is married. He is taught that he either conforms to the social notch cut out for him or his sex life will be hobbled and his tender companionship will be zero. He is made to see that women demand secu rity more than logical, principled, or honorable behavior. By the time his son must go to war, fath er (with jelly for a backbone) will slam a gun into junior's hand before father will risk the censure of his peers, or make a hypocrite of himself by crossing the inve stment he has in his own personal opinion or self-esteem.

Factor III - Mother The female element of human society is ruled by emotion first and logic second. In the battle between logic and imagination, imagination always wins, fantasy prevails, maternal instinct domi nates so that the child comes first and the future comes second. A woman with a newborn baby is too starry-eyed to see a wealthy man's cannon fodder or a cheap source of slave labor. A woman must, however, be conditioned to accept the transition to \"reality\" when it comes, or sooner.
