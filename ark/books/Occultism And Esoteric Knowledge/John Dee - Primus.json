Beside these, the Booke intituled, The 48 Claves Angelicæ , also, Liber Scientia Terrestris Auxilii & Victoria (These two being those very individuall Bookes which the Angells commanded to be + burnt , & were after ++ restored by them as appeares by the printed Relation of Dr: Dee’s Actions with Spirits pag: 418 & 419) The Booke intituled De Heptarchia Mystica Collectaneorum Lib: Primus , and a Booke of Invocations or Calls , begining with the Squares filld with letters, about the Black Cross. These 4 Bookes I have bound up in another volume. All which, were a few daies before delivered to my said Servant, for my perusall (I being then at Dr: William Lillies house at Hersham in Surrey) by my good freind Mr: Thomas Wale, one of his Majesties Warders in the Tower of London. 1586 +10.

On the 10th: of the said Sept: Mr: Wale came thither to me againe, & brought his wife with him, from her I received the following account of the preservation of these Bookes, even till they came to my hands, vizt: That her former Husband was one Mr: Jones a Confectioner, who formerly dwelt at the Plow in Lumbardstreet London, & who, shortly after they were married, tooke her with him into Alde streete among the Joyners, to buy some Houshold stuff, where (at the Corner house) they saw a Chest of Cedarwood, about a yard & halfe long, whose Lock & Hinges, being of extraordinary neate worke, invited them to buy it. The Master of the shop told them it had ben parcell of the Goods of Mr: John Woodall Chirurgeon (father to Mr: Tho: Woodall Late Serjant Chirurgeon to his now Majestie King Charles the 2d: (my intimate friend) and tis very probable he bought it after Dr: Dee’s death, when his goods were exposed to Sale.

They made no great matter of these Bookes &c: because they understood them not, which occasioned their servant Maide to wast about one halfe of them under Pyes & other like uses, which when discovered, they kept the rest more safe. About two yeares after the discovery of these Bookes, Mr: Jones died, & when the fire of London hapned, though the Chest perished in the Flames, because not easily to be removed, yet the Bookes were taken out & carried with the rest of Mrs: Jones her goods into Moorefields, & being brought safely back, she tooke care to preserve them; and after marrying with the foresaid Mr: Wale, he came to the knowledge of them, & thereupon, with her consent, sent them to me, as I have before set downe. — E.

And, Seeing, I have red in thy bokes, & records, how Enoch enjoyed thy favor and conversation, with Moyses thow wast familier: And allso that to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Josua, Gedeon, Esdras, Daniel, Tobias, and sundry other, thy good Angels were sent, by thy disposition, to instruct them, informe them, help them, yea in worldly and domesticall affaires, yea and sometimes to satisfy theyr desyres, dowtes & questions of thy Secrets. And furdermore Considering, the Shew stone, which the high preists did use, by thy owne ordering: wherein they had lights and Judgments in theyr great dowtes: and considering allso that thow (O God) didst not refuse to instruct thy prophets, (then, called Seers) to give true answers to common people of things æconomicall, as Samuel, for Saul seeking for his fathers asses being gon astray: and of other things vulgar true predictions, whereby to wyn credyt unto thy waightier affayres: And thinking with my self, the lack of thy wisdome; to me, to be of more importance, then the value of an Asse or two, could be to Cis, (Saul his father): And remembring what good cownsayle thy Apostle James giveth, saying, Si quis autem vestrûm indiget sapientia, postulet a Deo, &c .

Then Uriel toke a little rownd Tablet, as it were, of the bignes of a sixpence, having two letters in it, thus: and gave it to Michaël. Uriel lifted up the Table cloth: and, from thence, seamed to take apparaile, and put on the man. It semed to be sylk: and very full of wrynkles, or plights.
