The details and particulars will have fuller meaning if the underlying principles are first appre- ciated. The present section deals with the period extending from the collapse of the pagan Mysteries to the end of the Age of Chivalry. For practical purposes, the Esoteric Schools, which championed the human cause through the Dark Ages and the medieval world, may be considered to- gether as the Orders of the Quest. The symbolism and rituals of these Fraternities of the Middle Ages involved a search for something remote or hidden. To succeed in the Quest, the knight or companion (disciple) must dedicate himself to the service of his afflict- ed and exploited fellow man. He must rescue his own soul-the \"fair maiden in distress\"-by over-coming the giants, dragons, demons, and wicked nobles who pillaged the countryside. As a reward for these noble pursuits, the Christian and godly knight could aspire to a heavenly vision of spiritual mysteries. The legends of chivalry are veiled accounts of man's eternal search for truth. These beautiful stories are not, however, merely folklore. They are parts of an orderly tradition, unfolding through the centuries and bearing wit- ness to a well-organized plan and program. Like the myths of classical antiquity, the hero tales are sacred rituals belonging to secret Fraternities perpetuating the esoteric doctrines of antiquity. 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 THE ADEPTS An attempt to trace the descent of the adept tradition through these centuries of almost complete secrecy is ex- ceedingly difficult. The initiates could not reveal their true identities, their places of habitation, or the programs they were seeking to advance. Most names which have descended to us are pseudonyms, the locations imaginary or deliberately falsified, and the projects themselves con- cealed under extravagant fables. Unless the student has some sympathetic grasp of the situation and has trained himself to observe landmarks, he can discover little of gen- uine significance. It has seemed advisable, however, to approach the sub- ject in a sober and factual manner. We have purposely avoided such reports and accounts as depend entirely upon extrasensory perception for their validity. We are fully aware of the so-called \"clairvoyant investigations\" and \"secret histories\" which are preserved and taught by mod- em mystical sects. I t does not seem necessary to our pur- pose to either accept or reject these traditions, although their inclusion certainly would add glamour to the narra- tion. The adept tradition in early Europe is traceable by natu- ral means and normal faculties, if we are prepared to un- dertake the task and have access to the necessary reference material. It is quite possible to overlook or undervalue obscure details, but these do not impair, certainly they do not discredit, the major premise. There is an incontrovertible mass of evidence indicating the existence of initiated phi- losophers possessing a superior knowledge of divine and natural laws. There is also sufficient proof that these initiates were the agents of a World Fraternity or Brother- hood of Adepts that has existed from the most remote time. This overfraternity has been called the Philosophic Empire, the Great School, the College of the Holy Spirit, and the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ORDERS OF THE QUEST 7 Invisible Government of the World. References to this sovereign body of \"the ancient ones of the earth\" occur in the sacred writings, the philosophical literature, and the mystical traditions of all the races and nations of mankind. We have selected from the most reputable sources ves- tiges relating to the Academy of the Adepts. The reader is invited to consider these fragments, to examine their con- tents, and to discover for himself the veritable accounts which they conceal. We believe that the thoughtful and discriminating student will have little difficulty in recogniz- ing the essential landmarks. We further believe that he will come to understand why we have referred to the stream of the secret doctrine as Humanism. The term is not used in its popular sense, but to describe the grand program of the Mystery Schools for the emancipation of man from bondage to ignorance, superstiton, and fear. Civilization is unfolding according to a predetermined plan, and not by accident and fortuitous circumstance. This plan does not limit the individual to any creed or doctrine, but invites him to recognize those essential disciplines by which he can attain internal security for himself and can contribute to the final emancipation of all men. The adepts are the philosophic-elect-the priest-kings and the shepherds of the herds of human souls. During enlightened ages, they have appeared as venerated teachers, social re- formers, seers, and prophets. In benighted times, their leadership has taken on various appearances) but its sub- stance is unchanging and unchangeable. We have dis- tinguished three important divisions in the European descent of the Mysteries: first, the Orders of the Quest; second, the Orders of the Great fVork, and third, the Orders of Universal Reformation. The first group was dedicated to the restoration of the secret sciences through search and discovery. The second group was devoted to the proof and"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 THE ADEPTS personal accomplishment of that which was known to be true. And the third group was resolved to apply the proven principles of the esoteric tradition to the enlargement, res- toration, and reformation of collective society. If the reader may wonder why we do not attempt to re- veal the names, lives, and particular accomplishments of the Masters of the Quest, in this way supplying glamorous biographies of real or suspected adepts of the period, let him pause for a moment and consider. These initiates neither required nor desired the aggrandizement of their persons. Like all worthy men and women, they preferred to be honored through their work, and submerged their identities in their programs so completely that their personalities have become one with their principles. Such biographical mate- rial as is available is nearly always mythical and symbolical. What we take to be an account of the men themselves is merely the record of their advancement in the sacred Orders. In later centuries we have some details about the initiates; but during the period of the Quest, we do well, indeed, if we can identify certain outstanding Humanists with the Secret Societies, which were the proper- custodians of the great descent. Our purpose is accomplished if we can convey some general realization of the motions of the Phil- osophic Empire, from the complete secrecy of its origin to its final emergence as the natural government of the world.

Manes, or Mani, proclaimed himself the Paraclete, the Comforter promised by Christ to his disciples. The true name of this Persian sage was Shuraik (in Latin, Cubricus), but after his initiation he took the name Manes, which, according to Plutarch, means The Anointed. Manes, the founder of the Manichaean sect, was born in Babylon, A. D. 215-16. He received his early education from his father, a devoutly religious man, whose spiritual convictions were influenced by Mandaean, Gnostic, and Christian associations. There are also indications that both father and son had a familiarity with the teachings of Sabianism. Later, Manes traveled extensively, was a volu- minous writer, and a profound student of the religions of Transoxiana, India, and Western China. * Manes was an initiate of the Mysteries of Mithras, and among his teachers was Terebinthus, an Egyptian philoso- pher and magician.

It is certain, however, that he contacted early heretical sects, and was also cognizant of the cabalistical speculations of the Jewish mystics. He regarded the philo- sophical systems of the pagan sages as superior to both Judaism and primitive Christianity. He proclaimed his own ministry at the court of the Persian King, Shapur I, (A. D. 240-42), possibly on the coronation day of that monarch. The career of the prophet Manes made many demands upon his courage and devotion, but he faced the disasters of his life sustained by internal visions and mystical experi- ences. He was unable to maintain a favorable position in the Persian court due to the pressure exerted against him by the priests of Zoroaster. He acquired some distinction as a physician, but his skill was not sufficient to preserve the life of one of the sons of the ruling prince. His prestige undermined, Manes was exiled through the contrivances of the Mazdians, and he undertook his memorable journeys. During this same period, he lived for a year in a cave, with only wild herbs for food. Later, Manes was recalled to Persia by a more generous prince, was received with great honors, and a palace was erected for his use. For a brief time his fortunes flourished, and he was consulted on important matters of state. But when Bahram I ascended the throne, the prophet fell upon evil times. Bahram, for political reasons, supported the Zoroastrian clergy, and these were resolved to destroy the heretical sect and its founder. Manes was crucified and flayed alive (A. D. 276-77), and his body was exposed to various indignities. The doctrine of Manes was rooted in Persian dualism, but he drew essential dogmas from the various schools of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ORDERS OF THE QUEST 11 Southern Europe, Mesopotamia, North Africa, and Central Asia. The Manichaeans practiced the sacraments of bap- tism and communion. They accepted the ministry of Christ, but not the divinity of Jesus. Manes condemned the Christians as worshipers of idols, declaring that they had substituted men for gods, and then images for men. The sect, however, admired St. Paul, and acknowledged Jesus I mpaiibolis, the Christ within that was the hope of glory. After the death of Manes, the progress of the sect was entrusted to a circle of initiates, and these defined the degrees of the Order, its initiatory rites, signs, symbols, and passwords. The broad esoteric foundation of Manichaeism appealed to scholars of all beliefs, including the better- informed Christians. Salomon Reinach gives the following valuable summary of the history of the sect: \"The Mani- chaeans were gentle and peaceable persons; this was the opinion of the Greek philosopher Libanius. But as they rejected the rites of existing Churches, and claimed to con- fine themselves to the ministrations of their own priests, those of other religions persecuted them furiously, and excited the mob against them by calumnies. When it was first attacked in Persia, Manicheeism spread toward Turki- stan. India and China, and at the same time towards Africa by way of Syria and Egypt. Diocletian prohibited it in A. D.290, and the Christian Emperors from A. D. 377 on- ward legislated against it; the Vandals burnt or exiled the Manichaeans. African Manicheeism is known to us chiefly through the works of St. Augustine, who wrote long treatises against its doctors, after having been their pupil. In the east, the sect was almost exterminated by the severity of Justinian, but it formed again in Asia Minor. We read of the Paulitians in Armenia (seventh to twelfth centuries), the Bogomiles in Thrace (tenth to eleventh century). The"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 THE ADEPTS Byzantine Emperors, Alexis Comnenus in particular, pur- sued these inoffensive sectaries with fire and sword. In the eleventh century Manicheeism, brought by the commerce of the Levant, penetrated into Southern France, and gave rise to the powerful sect of the Cathari, who were ex- terminated by the Inquisition.\"* Heckethorn extends this history with many interesting details. He notes: \"By changing its name, seat, and figura- tive language, Manichaeism spread in Bulgaria, Lombardy (Patarini ), France (Cathari, Albigenses), etc., united with . the Saracens, and openly made war upon the Emperor, and its followers perished by thousands in battle and at the stake; and from its secular trunk sprang the so-called heresies of the Hussites and Wyckiffites, which opened the way for Protestantism.\"]' . The same author then establishes the Templars and Free- masons in the Manichacan descent, and concludes by show- ing how their doctrines were echoed in the songs of the Troubadours and the covenants of the guilds. From the Societies, Fraternities, and Orders which perpetuated the esoteric doctrine of the Manichaeans, we gain considerable insight into the essential teachings of the sect. They be- lieved in a primitive religion ever-existing in the world, of which formal theologies were corrupted forms. They held that enlightened and purified love was the highest of human emotions, and manifested as a simple and natural love for God in heaven above and for man on the earth below. The practical religion of love was expressed through kindliness, friendliness, tolerance, and patience. The wise man became the protector or father of those less informed than himself. Only those who truly loved their fellow men ·See Orpheus, a History of Religions, tSee Secret Societies of All Ages."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ORDERS OF THE QUEST 13 and proved that affection through the defense of the rights of man were entitled to regard themselves as religious. The secret assemblage of the Manichaeans was dedicated to the liberation of the human being from all despotism and tyranny. The end to be attained was an enduring brother- hood of mankind. Men should be ruled by love alone and should love their rulers. Leaders should deserve this affec- tion, and all kingdoms and nations should dwell together in peace, governed by just laws and noble examples. All tyranny must end; all false doctrines must: fall when the light of truth-the Christ within-is acknowledged as the Universal Redeemer. St. Augustine was drawn to Manichaeism because it interpreted the Christian religion in terms acceptable to his inquiring mind. He had already decided that the Church was ridden with superstition and lacked philosophic depth. He remained absorbed in this so-called heresy for nine years, but was never able to penetrate deeply enough into the mysticism of the sect to overlook the shortcomings of the members. Certainly his subsequent opinions were influenced by his associations with the followers of Manes. He departed from them through a disinterest in mysticism, for which his intellect was not suited. The Church, in the treatment of the Manichaeans, fol- lowed its usual procedure of accusing all heretical groups of practicing immoral and infernal rites. St. Augustine, who had an intimate knowledge of the sect, made no such accusations. His temperament would have inclined him to do so had there been any reasonable grounds. After departing from the heresy of Manes, St. Augustine came under the influence of Bishop Ambrose, a fine and noble man addicted to the teachings of Origen. Origen now stands precariously on the borderline of heresy, for he him-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 THE ADEPTS self was influenced by Gnosticism, N eoplatonism, and, in- credible as it may seem, by the doctrine of Manes. Some of the writings of Manes have survived, and from them we learn their concept of the Divine Nature: \"The spirit of God is Light, radiant with the virtue of love, faith, fidelity, high-mindedness, wisdom, meekness, knowledge, understanding, mystery, and insight.\" Leo the Great de- cided that such a belief should be stamped out lest the creed of the Church be extinguished. This pontiff also found it embarrassing to contemplate the idea that in the spiritual succession Jesus was succeeded by Manes, who was the last and greatest of the prophets emanated from the Divine, and who was the ambassador of the Light of the World. . One of the annual rituals of the Manichaeans was cele- brated to commemorate the crucifixion of the prophet. This consisted of placing a chair on a platform with five steps. Those members of the Order who had purified them- selves for the occasion were permitted to kneel before this empty chair which symbolized the \"unseen Master\" of their sect. This empty chair is reminiscent of the vacant throne of Osiris, in the Egyptian initatory ritual. The fol- lowers of Manes were called \"the Sons of the Widow\" and the founder himself was referred to as \"the Widow's Son.\" The popular story that Manes gained this title by being redeemed from slavery by a rich widow is about as plausible as the legend that the Order of the Garter was created in honor of the Countess of Salisbury's garter. Horus, the savior-god of the Osirian mysteries of Egypt, was a \"Widow's Son.\" He was posthumously conceived by the holy spirit of Osiris, his murdered father. The ghost of Osiris overshadowed his sister-wife, Isis, who had dressed herself in widow's weeds to lament her dead hus- band. Horus, thus strangely and immaculately conceived,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ORDERS OF THE QUEST 15 was destined to become the \"hero of the world\" and the avenger of his father. In fact, it was believed by some that Horus was possessed by the spirit of his own father. The hieroglyphic of Osiris is the All-seeing-Eye combined with the Empty Throne. Isis is the Virgin of the World, who bears the divine child without the loss of her virginity. She is the esoteric tradition which gives birth to the adepts by a mystery \"in the spirit.\" She is the Sophia of the Gnosis, the \"blessed demoiselle\" of the Troubadours and the later mystics. In Christian and neo-Christian symbol- ism, Sophia appears again as the \"Bride of the Lamb.\" Manes, therefore, was not literally a widow's son, for his father survived to assist in his education. He had attained the second birth; that is, he had been born out of the womb of the Mysteries, and those of his followers who had re- ceived the initiation were identified in the same way. By his martyrdom Manes became another Osiris, Lord of the Empty Throne. He overshadowed his Order as a spirit, and from the sanctuary of Manes were born new sons to extend, his doctrines, thus becoming in a mystical sense the re-embodiment of himself. Deprived of their Master, the body of the Manichaeans was appropriately symbolized by the legend of Isis mourning for her martyred Lord. The Albigenses. In order to appreciate the degree of organized resistance that developed in Europe against the remnants of the pagan philosophical schools, it is only necessary to consider the fate of the Albigensian heretics. The sect originated in Manichaeism, a school of esoteric philosophy which exer- cised a considerable influence over the early life of St. Augustine. Later this pious man devoted much time and many words to a bitter denunciation of the heresiarch Manes. It is probable that the Albigenses originated in"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 THE ADEPTS Bulgaria, but their principal stronghold was in Southern France\" where they created a considerable stir during the 12th and 13th centuries. So thoroughly were the Albigensian doctrines stamped out by the Roman Church that it is almost impossible to restore the structure of their beliefs. We know that they were Catharists believing in the ultimate salvation of all men. They were devout Christians but rejected the machinery of the Church, and taught that any who died without being reconciled to God through the mystery of Christ would be born again in the physical world as a human being or an animal. The Catharists baptized by the laying on of hands, and taught that the kingdom of Christ was a mystery of the spirit and not of this world. The Albigenses also derived inspiration from the Bogo- miles, a religious community of considerable antiquity which inspired many of the unorthodox sects of Russia. The Bogomiles denied the miraculous birth of Christ, rejected most of the sacraments of the Church, baptized only adults, had no formal places of worship, and interpreted the miracles of Jesus mystically rather than literally. They had the quaint notion that Satan was responsible for setting up all the churches of Christendom as a means of destroying human souls. It is quite understandable that in 1209 Pope Innocent III obliged the Cistercians to preach a crusade against the Albigensian heretics. In the civil war that followed, the Provencal civilization was destroyed, but the Albigenses survived. About thirty years later the Inquisition stepped in with better success. Maurice Magre writes of the Albigenses thus: \"I feel indignant at a great injustice which has never been remedied and seems unlikely to be remedied.

Calumny has been so active and so skillful that the descendants of these wonderful men are unaware of the noble history of their ancestors, and when they wish to learn it, it is presented in such a fashion that they blush at their extraordinary past.\"* It seems that some of the Catharist communities prac- ticed a mode of life strongly reminiscent of the Syrian Essenes, C. W. Heckethorn gives us an excellent summary of their doctrine and conduct: \"In spite of the Church many Italian cities including Milan, Florence, Naples, and even Rome itself were centers of Cathari activity. A Cathari concealed its doctrine from all but its higher initiates. It taught metempsychosis assuming that to attain the light seven such transmigrations were required. This however may possibly refer to the degrees of their initiation. They rejected the Old Testament account of the creation, and had communistic tendencies; were adverse to marriage; were philanthropists; they lived industrious lives, combin- ing saving habits with charity; founded schools and hOSpI- tals .... They performed their ceremonies in forests, caverns and remote valleys. At his initiation the novice received a garment made of fine linen and wool which he wore under his shirt. The women received a girdle which they wore next to the skin above the waist.\"t The same author describes the fate of Dolcino, one ot the leaders of the Italian Catharists. He and his wife Margaret were pursued by the Inquisition in 1307.

Fifteen years later, thirty of Dolcino's disciples were burned alive in the market place at Padua. The remnants of these so-called heretical movements found some refuge in Eastern Europe in areas which came under the political domination of the Turks. Under the general name Albigenses, these several schools of primitive and mystical Christianity bestowed their life and vitality upon the Knights Templars, the Rosicrucians, and later, by descent, upon the Bavarian Illuminists. The Crusaders brought back to Europe the Eastern Manichae- ism with its rationalizing and moderating influences. Re- forms long overdue began to stir beneath the surface of the medieval world. As one writer has expressed it: \"Philosophy, republicanism, and industry assailed the Holy See.\" It is known that the inner council of the Albigenses con- sisted of initiates whose method of development was not dissimilar to that of the Gnostics or the N eoplatonists. These initiates were internally enlightened men, dedicated to the perpetuation of Plato's concepts of the Philosophic Empire and the philosopher-king. Only those who lived the Christian life could know the Christian doctrine. By the end of the 14th century the sect disappeared entirely, and such physical power as it may have been said to enjoy was entirely destroyed. This so-called power was simply an appeal to virtue, and at no time did the sect exhibit any physical ambitions other than those of justice, charity, and humility. It is certain that the adepts of the Albigenses, Catharists, and Bogomiles did not perish with the fall of their schools. Such a sacrifice would have accomplished nothing of prac- tical benefit to mankind. They chose to remain hidden and to create new channels for the dissemination of their"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ORDERS OF THE QUEST 19 doctrines. These channels changed their appearances to meet the requirements of time and place. Thus, there is no break in the esoteric descent of essential truths even though the physical institutions were destroyed by the fanaticism and cruelty of an unbelieving world. The Glory of the Guilds It is now fairly well-established that the art of paper- making was brought to Europe from the Near East by the Crusaders returning from the Holy Land, or by the Moors who established their culture in Spain. Indications seem to point to China as the country responsible for the inven- tion of paper. Harold Bayley opens a large subject when he writes: \"It is a fact, the significance of which has hitherto been unnoticed, that the early papermaking dis- tricts were precisely those that were strongholds of the heretical sects known as the Albigenses. The word 'Albi- genses' is a term applied loosely to the various pre-Reforma- tion reformers whose stronghold stretched from Northern Spain across the southern provinces of France from Lom- bardy to Tuscany.':\" Papermaking opened the way for printing in Europe. Printing from movable type also was invented in China or Korea at least two hundred years before its appearance in Europe. The histories of European papermaking and printing are exceedingly vague. Almost nothing is known of the circumstances leading to the production of books in the West. Bayley made an extensive study of the water- marks, head pieces, and colophons appearing in early books. He is convinced that these indicate the existence of a secret religious tradition or spiritual communion by which these artisans constituted an esoteric Fraternity or Brotherhood. \"See A New Light on the Renaissance."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 THE ADEPTS The persecution of the Albigenses scattered the Masters of the sect over the entire Continent. The higher initiates of the Albigenses were called the Perfect Ones; and, accord- ing to one writer, in the year A.D. 1240 at least four thou- sand of these Perfect Ones were wandering about Europe in various disguises as troubadours, peddlers, merchants, and journeymen. These artisans and craftsmen established themselves in their chosen crafts and trades, and from them descended many distinguished printing establish- ments. That these printers were members of a Secret Order explains a situation otherwise completely incredible. In the great period of the publication of books and tracts dealing with alchemy, cabalism, magic, Rosicrucianism, and the projected reformation of the arts and sciences, an un- usual situation arose. Most of the books were published anonymously or under pseudonyms. In many cases elab- orate ciphers were incorporated into the text, and curious emblems and symbolical figures were introduced. Such an elaborate program, involving printers in several countries operating with extreme secrecy, would not have been pos- sible without the complete co-operation of the printers themselves. In spite of bribery, threat, and persecution, the printers revealed neither the sources of the manuscripts which they published nor the true names of the authors. If it can be proved, as present indications suggest, that the printers, typesetters, and engravers were themselves citizens of the same Invisible Commonwealth as the authors, philoso- phers, mystics, and scholars, the dimensions of the project become clearly defined. Take, for example, the famous \"jug\" watermark found in the paper on which most of the first editions of the writ- ings of Lord Bacon were printed. This jug recurs also in many of the publications involved in the early Rosicrucian controversy.

He supports his conviction with many ingenious examples of this vase which can be traced directly to the Albigensian papermakers. In my library is a copy of Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy with the vase watermark. On one leaf only-the dedication page-appears an entirely different watermark, consisting of a heart that contains within it a crucified rose. This is a complete Rosicrucian emblem, and the book itself con- tains references to the Rosicrucians. WATERMARK DEVICE From dedication page of the 1628 edition of The Anatomv of Melancholy. Those who doubt the existence of hidden texts within certain books of the late 16th and early 17th centuries have always objected on the grounds that printers would have to be a party to the secret texts, and could not have been prevented from exposing the facts in the course of time. Also, a vast amount of labor which would have been ex- tremely costly would necessarily be involved. If, however, the printers were performing a labor of love and were them- selves initiates of a Secret Order, these objections are no longer valid.

The medie- val mind was not addicted to fictional literature such as is popular in the present century.

Most of these slighter productions were tinged with heresy, and perpetuated the Humanism of the trouveres.

The spirit of the book reflects an intellectual transition from mental surfdom to that state of intellectual revolution which made possible the right of free thought.

Harold Bayley writes of this cycle of animal stories thus: \"The stories of how Reynard the Fox outwitted his traditional enemy, Isengrim the Wolf, were popular in Europe for many centuries. If we substitute Heresy for Reynard, and Rome for Isengrim, we can under- stand why these seemingly childish stories enjoyed such an immense vogue. 'These Heretic foxes,' percipiently said Gregory IX, 'have differnt faces, but they all hang together by the tails.''' Unfortunately, the French originals of the stories are lost, but it is safe to assume that they originated in the 13th century among those same Troubadours who found so many adroit means of discomfiting the monkish Orders. The \"Dance of Death\" is the name generally given to a series of pictures and moral compositions intended to re- mind the thoughtful of the impermanence of material digni- ties and honors. The symbolism originated in pagan antiquity, but the development of the theme is now asso- ciated with Swiss artists working in Basel in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. This version of La danse macabre is referred to as the Basel recension. It seems to me that this cycle of morality emblems is part 'of the Humanist motion.

Often these embellishments were con- cealed in obscure places, but scarcely a medieval structure has survived which does not include the symbols and signa- tures of the Secret Societies. The conspiracy extended through the entire world of the arts. This broad dissemina- tion was only possible because the separate guilds and unions were aware of the high purpose for which the guild system had been established. The guilds formed a link between the Troubadours and the trade unions. The trade unions were societies of artisans nourished by the apprentice system. The secrets of various arts and crafts were jealously guarded by the guild Masters, whose arms and crests dangled from hooks around the great Guild Cup in the midst of their Lodge. This Guild Cup was again the Chalice of Bacchus, the Holy Grail, and the symbolical Cup of the Mysteries. The guild Masters used the language of their crafts to conceal the mysticism of the great Humanist Reformation. Each guild taught the Universal Mystery in the language of its own art. Thus, within architectural terms, the stone- masons concealed the building of the universal temple of the brotherhood of man. The guild system took deep roots in Germany, but was also well-established in other countries on the Continent, and in England. So far as the world knew, the guilds were simply trade unions, but there was scarcely one of them which was not influenced to some degree by the old heresy of Manes. It is difficult to distinguish the details of the transition which resulted in the emergence of the German Minne- singers from the older body of the Bards and the Trouba- dours. The term Minnesang (minne J meaning love) was originally applied to the song or poem written by a knight to express his passionate devotion to the mistress of his"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"ORDERS OF THE QUEST 27 heart. It was not long, however, before the term took on a wider meaning to include all music and poetry: religious, political, and amorous. The principles of the Minnesang reached Germany from Provence, which was one of the last strongholds of the Albi- gensian Troubadours. The kings of Provence were patrons of the arts, and under their protection there was a brief flowering of song and poetry. Most of the Minnesingers were drawn from the ranks of the gentry, and it was only natural that the less-privileged classes should develop their version of the same convictions. Out of the Minnesingers, with their combination of mournful tunes, and also from the music of the peasantry evolved the Meistersingers, the burgher musicians of Germany. For the most part, the Order was composed of artisans, good solid citizens, with long coats, square-toed shoes, and orthodox religious con- victions. They were good, practical men, hard-working, shrewd, and skillful in their crafts. Few, if any, had re- ceived formal education in music, and their talents were natural rather than acquired. The long shadow of the Manichaean doctrine reached into the guildhalls and even into the somber cloisters of the cathedrals. The guilds were champions of the human cause, institutions of fair play and honest practice. They were co-operatives, protecting their members from society in general, and protecting society from shoddy goods and unreasonable exploitation. In a quiet way, the guild masters legislated the life of the times, and these solid, good-hearted citizens endeavored in all things to judge righteous judgment. What better place could be found in which to plant the seeds of the democratic dream? From these small centers of self-government might flow the con- cept of the World Guild, the World Commonwealth, indeed the Philosophic Empire."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 THE ADEPTS The Meistersingers declared their Order to have orig- inated with twelve guild poets, who had derived their inspiration from the Troubadours and the Minnesingers. The very selection of this number and its use in their sym- bolism suggests that the Order originated in the old Mys- tery systems, which always celebrated twelve gods, twelve prophets, twelve patriarchs, or twelve disciples. When we attempt to trace the twelve guild poets of the Middle High German, we come immediately upon the most celebrated name associated with the Minnesang, Wolfram von Eschen- bach. He competed in the tourney of the poets known as the Wartsburgskrieg. This episode is preserved for music lovers in Wagner's opera, Tannhauser. The place occupied by von Eschenbach in the descent of the Orders of the Quest will be given greater consideration in the sections devoted to the Grail legends. The Knights Templars In Isis Unveiled, H. P. Blavatsky refers to the Knights Templars as \"the last European secret organization which, as a body, had in its possession some of the mysteries of the East.\" A few paragraphs later she adds: \"They reverenced the doctrines of alchemy, astrology, magic, kabalistic talismans, and adhered to the secret teachings of their chiefs in the East.\" The Order of Knights Templars was founded in 1118 by Hugh de Payen and Geoffrey of St. Orner, together with seven other French knights then stationed in Palestine. These gentlemen were motivated by a determination to guard the roads of Christian pilgrimage to the shrine of the Holy Land. During the first nine years of the Order, the Templars lived in extreme poverty. Hugh de Payen and Geoffrey of St. Orner had but one war horse between them.

Pope Honorius confirmed the Order of the Temple, and appointed a white mantle as the distinguishing habit.

Candidates for initiation gave all their property and personal goods to the Order. Thus, while each was indi- vidually poor, the body as a whole became enormously rich. The principal officer of the Templars was the Grand Master, and, as the worldly estates of the body increased, he ranked as a prince at all the courts of Europe. Each new member took vows of chastity and obedience. \"1 swear,\" said the novice, \"to consecrate my thoughts, my energy, and my life, to the defense of the unity of God and the mysteries of the faith. . . . I promise to be submissive and obedient to the Grand Master of the Order.\"* Eliphas Levi and several other authors and historians advance the belief that Hugh de Payens had been initiated into a strange sect of Christian Johannites then flourishing in the East. The members of this group claimed that they alone were in possession of the inner mysteries of Christ. The supreme pontiffs of the Johannites assumed the title of \"Christ\" and claimed an uninterrupted transmission of power from the days of St. John. Dr. Oliver points out that many Secret Associations of the ancients either flourished or originated in Syria. It was here the Dionysian Artificers, the Essenes, and the Kasideans arose. In a work published in 1855, Dr. Oliver says: \"We are assured, that, not withstanding the unfavorable con- ditions of that province, there exists, at this day, on Mount Libanus, one of these Syriac Fraternities.

They seemed to have derived inspiration from the Nazarenes and certain Gnostic sects that denied the divinity of Christ, but acknowl- edged Jesus to be a great and holy prophet. They rejected utterly the Immaculate Conception and other cardinal tenets of the Western Church. The Johannites claimed to possess ancient records to the effect that when Jesus was a small child he was adopted by a Rabbi named Joseph, who carried him into Egypt where he was initiated into the occult sciences. The priests of Osiris, regarding him as the long-promised incarnation of Horus expected by the adepts, finally consecrated him Sovereign-Pontiff of the universal religion. At the time of Hugh de Payen, Theocletes was the living \"Christ\" of the J ohannites. He communicated to the founders of the Temple the ideas of a sovereign priesthood of dedicated and initiated men united for the purpose of .overthrowing the bishops of Rome and the establishment of universal civil liberty. The secret object of the johan- nites was the restoration of the esoteric tradition and the gathering of mankind under the one eternal religion of the world. \"Adler in Drusis Mentis Libani (Rome, 1786). tSee The History and Illustrations of Freemasonry Compiled From an Ancient Publication (New York, 1855)."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 THE ADEPTS Thus, from the beginning, the knights of the Temple served two doctrines.

Nothing is said, however, of the corruption that flourished among the institutions which the Templars opposed. At worst, they could be guilty only of counter- conspiracy, for Christendom at that time was devoted to a grand conspiracy against the parts of itself. Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Temple, was elected in 1297. Historians agree that this French knight was a man of noble character, and conducted him- self in an estimable manner throughout the difficult and tragic years of his rulership. Writers with various personal attitudes have advanced several explanations for the circum- stances which led to the persecution and destruction of the Order of the Temple. When all the elements of the story have been examined, it appears that their greater crimes were those of being wealthy and powerful. The French king, Philip the Fair, and the Roman Pope, Clement V, were resolved to destroy the Knights Templars and divide the treasures of the Order between themselves. The persecution of the Templars, thinly veiled under ecclesiastical and secular trials and convictions, extended over a period of approximately six years, and Jacques de Molay was imprisoned five and a half years before his execution. During this time the Grand Master, together with most of his officers and more prominent knights, was subjected to indescribable tortures. Many died of pain and exhaustion, and some, unable to endure further suffering, confessed to the crimes with which they had been charged. A number of these, however, later retracted their con- fessions and died gallantly, rather than to perjure their immortal souls to preserve their bodies. Typical of the means employed to destroy the Temple is the manner in which the first charges were made.

These men, to obtain their own liberation, resolved to accuse the Templars of monstrous offenses against the Church and State.

The two miserable men were released from prison as a reward for their lies, but they gained little from their liberty. One was afterward hanged, and the other, beheaded. It was upon such perjured testimony that the most magnificent Order of Chivalry was reduced to ashes. De Molay must have realized from the beginning of the elaborate series of trials that justice had no place in the procedures. The Order was doomed from the beginning, and on the 18th of March 1314, he stood before the cardinal of Alba and heard the sentence of perpetual im- prisonment. When the cardinal began a detailed account of the guilt of the Templars based upon confessions obtained by torture, the Grand Master interrupted him with a sweep- ing denial: \"I know the punishments which have been inflicted on all the knights who had the courage to revoke a similar confession; but the dreadful spectacle which is presented to me is not able to make me confirm one lie by another. The life offered to me on such infamous terms I abandon without regret.\" The commissioners were confounded, for they believed that torture and imprisonment had broken the spirit of the Templars.

The fuel had been arranged to burn slowly, so that the condemned men would suffer the maximum pain and distress. After the fires had been lighted, de Mola y addressed the huge assemblage with these prophetic words: \"France will remember our last moments. We die innocent. The decree that condemns us is an unjust decree, but in heaven there is an august tribunal, to which the weak never appeal in vain. To that tribunal, within forty days, I summon the Roman Pontiff. Oh! Philip, my king, I pardon thee in vain, for thy life is condemned at the tribunal of God. Within a year I await thee.\" The pontiff was stricken by an obscure ailment and actually died on the 19th day of the following month. The Church in which his body was placed took fire, and the corpse was half consumed. King Philip, before the year had elapsed, also departed from this world in misery and great pain. Most of the active persecutors of the Order perished by premature or violent deaths-events which caused widespread consternation. There is a legend held bv some authorities and rejected by others that in 1314 Jacques de Molay, realizing that his end was near, appointed Johannes Marcus Lormenius to be his successor. It is pointed out that the election of Lormenius can be questioned, because the Order was un- able to install him by the usual procedure. But extreme circumstances justified extreme measures, and the charter, bearing the signatures of the proper persons, is said to be still preserved in Paris. Levi gives a slightly different account.

Deodat J afet, one of the knights, speaking \"of his own free will\" after many hours of being broken on the rack, confessed anything that the inquisitors required. Under the gentle inspiration of thumbscrews and an iron boot crushing his heel bones, he described an image supposedly venerated by the Tem- plars: \"I was alone in a chamber with the person who received me: he drew out of a box a head, or idol, which appeared to me to have three faces, and said thou shouldest adore it as thy Saviour and that of the order of the Temple.\" Later, J afet retracted his entire confession, and stood to the last as one of the defenders of the Order. It is possible that this three-faced image was a Brahman Trimurti, which had come into the possession of the Tem- plars during their years in the Near East, or it may have existed only in the prepared confessions which the knights were so pleasantly induced to sign. In either event, this idol came to be identified with the secret activities of the Societies which perpetuated the Mysteries of the Temple. It should be mentioned that the knights were also accused of adoring a curious deity in the form of a monstrous head or a demon in the form of a goat.

We know, for example, that the German theologian, Johann Valentin Andreae, was a moving spirit in the universal reformation of mankind attempted in the opening years of the 17th century.

Like Akbar, the great Mogul who attained the distinction of being the world's most highly educated illiterate, Charlemagne found it more economical to hire readers than to burden his mind and time with too much schooling. Although Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope Leo III, and was presented with the keys to the grave of St. Peter, he never was actual- ly the sovereign of the Romans. His real position was that of protector and defender of the Popes. He encouraged a revision of the text of the Latin Vulgate, and left a con- siderable library of old manuscripts and records. He lived beyond his seventieth year and is said to have died of pleurisy. The historical Charlemagne became the central figure in an important cycle of myths and legends of pro- found interest to students of the esoteric tradition. The Orders of Chivalry were dedicated to the restoration of the primitive Christian Church as it existed in the time of the apostles. In order to accomplish this restoration, it was necessary to rediscover the high secrets of the Christian Mysteries. The esoteric Association of the San Grael, the Knighthood of the Round Table, the Knights Templars, the Knights Hospitalers of St. John of Jerusalem, and the Teutonic Knights have been called \"the military apostles of the religion of love.\" Heckethorn describes them as \"military troubadours, who, under the standards of justice and right, fought against the monstrous abuses of the Theo- cratic regime, consoled the 'widow'-perhaps the Gnostic Church-protected the 'sons of the widow'-the followers of Manes-and overthrew giants and dragons, inquisitors and churchmen.

D. 778 Charlemagne invaded Spain, captured Pamplona, and laid siege to Saragossa. In the midst of his campaign, news reached the king of a revolt among his Saxon subjects, and he was forced to abandon the Spanish war and hasten back to the Rhine. Incidentally, perhaps the change in plans was not entirely unwelcome, for the siege of Saragossa was going badly. While withdrawing the main body of his army through the wild gorges and hazardous defiles of the Pyrenees, his rear guard was cut off and completely annihilated by the Basques. These mountaineers attained this signal victory by starting ava- lanches in narrow places along the road and hurling boul- ders down upon the Franks. Among the generals of Charle- magne's army who perished in this action was Hruodland, praefect of the Breton march. On this slight historical foundation was built the hero legend of Roland (Hruod- land), one of the great epics of the Age of Chivalry. In its final form the Chanson de Roland bears little resem- blance to sober fact, but it is an excellent example of the allegories ingeniously devised by the Troubadours for the perpetuation of their Mystery cult. According to the legend of Roland, this culture hero is represented as the nephew of Charlemagne. He is one of the \"twelve peers\" forming the supreme council of the Frankish king. These peers, like the Knights of the Round Table, were nobles of exceptional valor and high integrity, all save one, the perfidious Lord Ganelon, whose treachery destroyed the sacred assembly.

Roland is a Christian Siegfried, a form of the \"hero of the world.\" In the legend of Roland, the Basques vanish entirely, and in their place is the vast army of the Saracens, the hosts of the unbelievers. The scene of the great hattIe is still the Pyrenees, and here the twelve peers, including Roland, Oliver, and the valiant Archbishop Turpin, the warrior-priest, die together to protect the withdrawal of Charlemagne and the main body of his army. At the time of the actual battle, Charlemagne was only thirty-six years old, but in the legend he is represented as a venerable man with long white hair and beard. The treason of Ganelon is revealed to the king in a dream, and when from a distance he hears the last blasts of Roland's war trumpets he returns to save his beloved nephew, but arrives too late. In the story he \"wreaks a terrible ven- geance\" upon the Saracens, but this has no foundation in fact. Lord Ganelon is tried for treason, found guilty, and torn to pieces by wild horses. An interesting reference to the court of Prester John occurs in the legends of Roland. In this account, Roland, afflicted with madness, wandered in the wilderness. At the court of Charlemagne, the peers resolved to seek the stricken hero, and Astolpho, the poet-knight, declared that he would devote himself to the quest.

When Prester John attempted to reach this spring, horrible disasters came upon the ex- pedition, and a voice from heaven spoke: \"Think not, vain man, to pry into the secret things of the Most High !\" From that time on, the court of Prester John was afflicted by the presence of seven Harpies that screamed and howled in the air and snatched the food from the banquet tables. Astolpho, by the blast of his magic horn, dispersed the Harpies; and in gratitude, Prester John supplied a band of warriors to assist Astolpho in his search for Roland. Although Charlemagne outwardly sustained the papacy, he was the Grand Master of a mystical and philosophical Fraternity which had descended from the Bards, the Druids, and the Drotts. As an initiate-king he is revealed as a patron of learning and the arts, and the virtual founder of the university system in Europe. He enriched the cloister schools, broadened their scope, and introduced many useful branches of secular instruction. His wars against the Sara- cens merely signified his victory over the subversive, anti- social forces of ignorance. Wagner, in his mystical music- drama, Parsifal, places the magical garden of Klingsor, the sorcerer, in a valley of Moorish Spain. In the original presentation of the opera, Klingsor was costumed as a Near Eastern potentate, and the flower maidens, whom he con- trolled by his enchantments, were dressed like the houris of The Arabian Nights' Entertainment. In recent years the Metropolitan Opera in New York has revived the correct costuming.

Candidates first became pages, then squires, and finally knights. After the mingling of the old military Fraternities with such mystical sects as the Albi- genses and the Ghibellines, the number of degrees was in- creased. In some groups there were as many as thirty-three grades somewhat similar to the structure of modern Free- masonry. The romances of the Round Table, the Holy Grail, and the Circle of Charlemagne certainly originated in the esoteric teachings of the Nordic, Gothic, and Celtic rites. Such legends as those of Parsifal, King of the Grail, and the Swan-knight Lohengrin, his son, are veiled reports of the Secret Schools of the adepts. Wagner's interpretation of the Grail Cycle, though based upon early traditions, was largely colored by his own mystical convictions. As he glorified the Orders of Chivalry in his Grail operas, so he dignified the guilds, which had the same origin, in his AI eistersinger of Nuremberg. The knight-initiates of the Brotherhoods of the Quest performed vigils, cultivated visions, and lived by rules and regulations as rigid as any monastic Order. They had signs and pass- words and were bound together by secret vows and obliga- tions. They were dedicated to the protection of the weak, the preservation of righteous peace, and the perpetuation of certain spiritual and philosophical secrets.

There was an old Druidic footing under the culture of the Gauls. One of the three branches of the Druid Order was known as the Bards. They were the wandering poets and minstrels, the singers of the Mysteries, concealing profound spiritual truths under gay songs, stories, fables, and myths. The Bards were a closely organized group.

Wig- ston, \"takes up the lighted torch of Homer and hands it on to Dante, who passes it to the genius behind the Shakespeare mask.\" The Troubadours were armed with one of the most important of all psychological formulas: If one would change the world, teach the young. They appointed them- selves the tutors of chivalry, and were regarded as peculiarly equipped to endow youth with an appropriate cultural viewpoint. On the surface, their advice was simple, honest, and effective, and obviously above reproach. They taught, for example, that a genteel man always mended an open seam in his garment; this is more important than to patch a hole. A hole may indicate long wear, but an open seam represents carelessness. Incidentally, these reformers were careful to prevent any open \"seams\" in their own associa- tion. Another precious bit of advice was, in effect: It is not important that the rich dress well, but most important that the poor dress neatly; small means plus neatness equal character. It may be inferred by the political consequences of their activities that the Troubadours did not limit themselves to a consideration of what the well-dressed young man should wear. Beneath the surface was the doctrine of the rights of man. The Order taught chivalry toward the weak, and emphasized that service for the common good was Nature's highest calling.

The Troubadours flourished in Southern France, Italy, and Northern Spain between the 11 th and 14th centuries. I t is now established with certainty that these men, who numbered about four hundred, were members of a secret mystical or philosophical Fraternity, dedicated to the dis- covery of those powers of the mind and heart which must be cultivated and disseminated before it is possible to bring about a universal reformation of mankind. In his most stimulating article, Alchemy and the Holy Grail, Harold Bayley writes: \"Everyone has heard of the Troubadours, but it is not generally realized that they were hereties under the ban of the Church and driven hither and thither by that relentless antagonist. Their mission, Aroux tells us, was to redress the wrongs of Rome, to take up the defense of the weak and oppressed. They were also represented and celebrated as the true soldiers of the Christ, the exponents of celestial chivalry, and the champions of the poor, attacking under all their forms the monstrous abuses of the Priesthood. It is said that great numbers of the higher classes became Troubadours, wandering from Court to Court and castle to castle, spreading the doc- trine of the organization for which they were acting as emissaries. ,,* In France the Troubadours were protected by the Albi- genses, for the obvious reason that both groups held the same convictions and descended from the same source.

Here under the guise of a most elementary and material passion they preached the gospel of the divine love of God for man, and the human love which alone could bring the Brotherhood of humanity. The Trouba- dours dedicated impassioned ballads to the fair lady of their hearts. Only the initiates, however, knew that this lady was the Isis of Sais, the Sophia of the Gnosis, and the Diana of the Ephesians. The body of the learned, which formed the secret council of the Order, was the custodian of an esoteric tradition that had descended from the Druidic, Egyptian, and Chaldean sages. These minstrels concealed their knowledge from the profane, not because they desired a superiority for themselves, but for the sake of self-preservation. The name troubadour means a \"seeker after something that is hidden,\" and a minstrel is a minister or religious teacher. But if the Troubadours worked quietly and industriously to further their doctrines, the adversaries were no less cunning. The Ohurch and State, aware that open rebellion threatened if the Troubadours were successful in setting up their great Court of Love (world democracy), quietly but relent- lessly tore down each structure raised by the singing sages. To preserve the social status in quo the Inquisition was set up, and one by one the initiates of Manes were trapped on some pretext. The real reason for their destruction was their political plotting against ecclesiastical and temporal autocracy. Once again the \"sons of the widow\" perished at the stake or gibbet, or were broken on the rack. It is said that Dante was a Troubadour, and when we examine the structure of the Divine Comedy the conviction grows. St. Francis of Assisi is believed to have received his first inspiration to mystical devotion from the Courts of Love. Among other important names associated with the Order are Richard the Lionhearted and the poet Petrarch.

We may suspect that Giordano Bruno, a martyr in the name of progr~ss, knew something of these Mysteries when he wrote in a letter: \"I am displeased with the bulk of mankind ... and am enamoured with one particular lady. 'Tis for her that I am free in servitude, content in pain, rich in necessity, and alive in death .... 'Tis for the love of true Wisdom and by the studious admiration of this Mistress that I fatigue, that I disquiet, that I torment myself.\" Even the uninitiated can scarcely miss the implication. The names of the principal Troubadours, from Guilhem IX, Count of Poi tiers, to Guiraut Riquier, can be traced in any standard text on the subject. From the membership we gain a reasonable comprehension of the stations and abilities of these initiate-poets and singers. We can also trace the survival of the Order in the Minnesingers, later Meistersingers, of the Rhine. The principles of the Minne- sang reached Germany from Provence, one of the last strongholds of the Troubadours. The Minnesingers also addressed their songs to a lady whose name must not be spoken, but in whose service the gallant knight must pine away in desperate poetic devotion. One of the greatest of the Minnesingers, Rinemar of Alsace, was called \"the scholastic philosopher of unhappy love.\" Names change, but the substance of the tradition is ever the same. The name Pleiad, from Pleiades, was first bestowed in Alexandria, that Egyptian city of initiates, scholars, and libraries, upon seven tragic poets who flourished in the 3rd century B. C. Later in French literature there is reference to the Pleiad of Charlemagne, King of the Franks, also an initiate. In the last quarter of the 16th century, the French Pleiade, a group of seven poets, of whom Pierre de Ronsard"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"was the most celebrated, attempted the renovation and enlargement of language as a means of literature and art. Lord Bacon is believed to have been in contact with the French Pleiade, and has been referred to as the eighth star in the \"constellation of the poets.\" Let us not deceive ourselves with the delusion that these servants of the Muses gathered by accident or appeared upon the intellectual horizon merely to glisten for a night. The Pleiade inherited the unfinished labors of the Trouba- dours, as these in tum were rooted in the confederation of the Orphic poets. Taliesin, the Initiate In the days of the good King Arthur, Elphin, the son of Gwyddno, had been granted a weir, which is a fence of stakes set in a waterway to take fish. Elphin was slow of mind, and it seemed that his wit was so dull that his father could think of no other way in which the young man could make a living except by profiting from the salmon catch. When Elphin went the next day to inspect his new weir, he found a leathern bag hanging from one of the posts. Upon opening the bag, Elphin discovered within it a living infant of wondrous beauty who had been cast up by the waters. He named the baby Taliesin, in reference to his radiant brow. Elphin did not know that the mother of Taliesin was Ceridwen, the goddess of the magic caldron, nor did he realize that the beautiful child had no other father but itself, for it was born through sorcery and enchantment. Ceridwen was resolved to slay her own son, but when he was born, she repented of her evil intent and placed him in a stream where some stranger would find him. Much of this story is reminiscent of the legend of Moses and his ark of bulrushes.

As the entertainers prepared to perform, however, he cast a spell upon them so that they could only bow before the king and make meaningless sounds. When the Bards accused the child of causing the sorcery, the great king bade him come forward and explain himself and his actions. The song of Taliesin on this occasion is one of the most remarkable poems in the philosophical literature of the world. Thus sang the Bard: \"Primary chief bard am I to Elphin, And my original country is the region of the summer stars; Idno and Heinin called me Merddin, At length every being will call me Taliesin. \"I was with my Lord in the highest sphere, On the fall of Lucifer into the depths of hell; I have borne a banner before Alexander; I know the name of the stars from north to sou tho \"I was in Canaan when Absalon was slain, I was in the court of Don before the birth of Gwydion.

Taliesin exists only as a name in the old history and literature of the Welsh. Many early songs and poems are attributed to him, but of the man himself nothing is known. It was not until the 16th century of the present era that even a mythical account of his life was compiled or in- vented. Of course it is possible that early and little-known legends were drawn upon, but it is equally possible that a story was manufactured to explain the writings attributed to this elusive Bard. In any case, Taliesin personifies the perfect initate of the later Druidic Mysteries. \\Ve use the word later because in most of his poems a strong Christian influence is present. He was the Christian Druid, accept- ing the new faith, but rejecting nothing of the old. The pagan philosophers of Britain and Gaul found many parallels between their own doctrine and those imported by the Catholic priests. It was quite evident to the wise men of the oak trees that Jesus was a Druid. His life and teachings agreed exactly with the reports about their own initiates, and the first Christian missionaries were not entire- ly loath to capitalize upon these real or apparent similarities. As a result, it is hard to say whether the Druidic Order became a pagan school of Christian Mysteries or a Christian school of pagan Mysteries. 53 ORDERS OF THE QUEST ·From the abridgment by T. W.

The Bards were so certain that they would be born again in the physical world that they lent money to be paid back in a future incarna- tion. Several such agreements are preserved in the British Museum. Pagan gods and Christian saints were honored together without the slightest hint of conflict, and such legends as those of the Holy Grail and Arthur's Round Table reveal the two systems in an indissoluble compound. Perhaps the Druid initiates knew more about esoteric Christianity than regular churchgoers of today would like to admit. These ancient philosophers were not overly im- pressed by appearances, and they accepted it as a matter of course that a great religion was by necessity a science of human regeneration concealed under mystical symbols. They applied their own Golden Key to the keyhole of the Christian fables, and were not at all surprised to find that it fitted perfectly. It is doubtful if the missionaries of the Church were as generous, and it is equally doubtful if they ever even knew what was happening. They were too busy making converts to investigate the minds and hearts of those they were converting. I t is impossible to bind those who have unfolded their own internal spiritual faculties to arbitrary limitations im- posed by any formal religious system. In all faiths, those truly wise perceive universal truths, and the more philo- sophical a system of belief, the more useful it is in inter- preting other systems that are founded upon similar prin- ciples. In his introduction to Barddas, Rev. J. Williams Ab Ithel quotes the following: \"And when we consider that the Gorsedd of the Bards was but a continuation, in the White Island, of the circular temples of patriarchal times, we may feel assured that it is among the ruins of"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Bardism, or the religious system connected with the prim- itive temples, we may hope to discover, if at all, that Golden Key concealed and secured, which can open the mysteries, or esoteric doctrine, of ancient nations.\" Taliesin was the Welsh Orpheus, for, like the Bard of Thrace, he charmed the whole world with his songs. He even descended into the underworld, and the dark land was filled with his music. Like Tuan mac Carell, the old Irish initiate of County Donegal, Taliesin remembered the many transformations (incarnations) through which he had passed, and he sang of the beginnings of life and the growths of men and the histories of his people, because he had the memory of the long-living in his own heart. According to the legends he did not die, but was again transformed. He grew old, and then \"he became young again;\" and when feebleness came upon him, he journeyed to the secret place to await the renewal of his body.

While still a small boy, Merlin was brought to the court of Vortigern, where he confounded the priestly astrol- ogers and made several extraordinary predictions that later proved to be entirely accurate. During the reign of Aurelius Ambrose, who succeeded Vortigern, Merlin is said to have brought the mighty stones of Stonehenge from Ireland to the plains of Salisbury in a single night. This monument had originally been set up"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"in Africa, and had been conveyed to Ireland by unknown means at a remote time. Merlin delivered the stones in Wilt- shire by a whirlwind, and placed them as they now stand over the graves of British lords slain: through treachery. Certainly this report cannot be taken literally, but if we understand by the circle of ancient stones the symbol of a Lodge of Druid initiates, the legend immediately has meaning. The Romans did not invade Ireland, and the pagan Mysteries were practiced there long after they had been destroyed in Britain. Merlin also served the next king, Uther Pend ragon, whose name means the head of the dragon. He served U ther as counselor and magician through the seven years of his reign, and by his enchantment made possible the birth of the hero-king, Arthur, the Boar of Cornwall. Arthur was the son of Uther Pendragon and Igema, Duchess of Cornwall. Much is made of the fact that the earliest historical records of King Arthur contain none of the mystical elements with which we are now familiar. There is no mention of the Holy Grail, the Round Table, or the magic sword Caliburn (Excalibur), which was fashioned in the land of the fairies. But the early legends do say that Merlin the Magician was with Arthur at his court at Caerleon-on-Usk, guiding the young king with wise counsel. Some writers have attempted to solve the historical problems by assuming that both Merlin and Arthur were gods of an old Mystery cult. In this vein Lewis Spence writes: \"It is plain that he [Arthur], like Osiris, is the god of a mystical cult who must periodically take a Journey through the underworld, not only for the purpose of sub- duing its evil inhabitants, but of learning their secrets and passwords in order that the souls of the just, the perfected initiates, will be enabled to journey through that plane unharmed ....

Druidism is only the cult of Osiris in another form, and Arthur seems to have a common origin with Ausar or Osiris.\"* Unfortunately the facts are somewhat more complicated. The Osiris myth itself is but a fragment out of context, and can never be understood by those who assume that legends wander up and down the world willy-nilly, imposing them- selves upon themselves in endless confusion. Certainly the Arthurian Cycle is part of the initiate tradition, but the key to it lies not in distant lands but in some deep hidden place within the structure of human consciousness. Merlin, like all these mysterious mythological sages, is the secret doctrine itself, born of heaven and earth and locked within a house of glass-the sphere of illusion. He is not some old Cy-mric demigod under a new name, but a personification of an order of learning. In all probability there was a historical Merlin; perhaps several old Welsh Bards and soothsayers have been combined to form the legend. But the true life story of Merlin the man will never be known for it was never recorded. The Merlin of the myth is the adept, whose identity has been absorbed into the Universal Mystery of human regeneration. The Great School is personified in each of its initiates. This is why the heroes of all nations pass through the same experiences. There is only one experience that can lead to truth, and there is only one description appropriate to those who have accomplished the divine adventure. Of course, all esoteric biographies are perpetuated in symbolic form, for it is im- possible to put into simple words those mysteries of the spirit that are not of this world.

The archdruids of Britain and Gaul were the winged serpents, and their most sacred symbol was the serpent's egg, a symbol of both the universe and the Mystery School. The Immaculate Conception was the second birth from this philosophic egg or the womb of the Mysteries. The magician is the Master of illusion and the oracle of Nature. This priestly adept is the ruler over all the rulers of the world by divine right. In the case of Merlin, the adept brought the circle of the living stones to Salisbury, not the monolithic rocks that now strew its plain, but the Gorsedd, the throne of the revelation of the ancient ones of the earth. The Gorsedd of the Druids became the Round Table of King Arthur. There is no break in the mystical descent, for the young king takes the place of the old king- long live the king! At first it seems that the magical caldron of Ceridwen gave place to the Grail, and that the old pagan Mysteries faded away before the light of Christendom. But exactly the reverse was true. The ancient wisdom ensouled the new faith, and the Holy Grail became the caldron of Ceridwen. Merlin sleeps in his glass tomb like the mysterious Father C. R. C. of the Rosy Cross, who is said to lie quickening in a womb of crystal. The dying King Arthur floats away to Avalon in a ship of glass.

The Arthurian Cycle Walter Map (Mapes), who died about 1209 at an advanced age, was the outstanding English literator and humorist at the court of King Henry II. From the meager records of his life, he seems to have been, at least indirectly, associated with the Troubadours. He is often referred to as an ecclesiastic and certainly held several benefices, but there is no direct record of his ordination. At one time, Map was clerk of the royal household and justice-itinerant. He studied in Paris, attended the Lateran council at Rome, and traveled extensively. Although it is believed that Map was responsible for link- ing the legend of King Arthur with the Grail Cycle, cautious researchers are inclined to question the popular account. The justice-itinerant was a busy man, and it is quite possible that such lengthy and involved legends as Lancelot, Mort Artus, and the Queste were the productions of a group rather than an individual. It appears likely, however, that Walter Map was responsible for the transplanting of certain romances of chivalry from the Continent to the British Isles, and mingling them with the streams of English folklore.

It is to the necromantic skill and wise counsels of Merlin that the King owes his birth, his crown, his order of Round Table knights, and his victories. It is Merlin who as Court prophet and councellor, predicts the grandest events in the life of his sovereign, and without whose advice no affair of moment is undertaken. \"* When Arthur was born he was wrapped in cloth of gold, and in fulfillment of an oath made by his father, Uther, was taken to the gate of the castle, and given into the keep- ing of Merlin. Arthur did not appear again in the legend until Uther, on his death-bed, acknowledged his son and recommended him to the barons as their rightful king. When the proper time came, Merlin, by his magic, caused to appear in the Cathedral Church of London, before the high altar, a large stone with an anvil of steel upon it and a sword thrust into the anvil. Beneath in letters of gold was the inscription: «(TV ho so pulleth out this sword of this stone and anuile, is rightwise king borne of England.\" Only Arthur could draw forth the sword, in this way proving his right to the succession. Weare reminded of Notung, the sword of the Volsungs, which Odin thrust into the oak, and which only Sigmund could draw from the tree. The sword trial represents the release of the will from bondage to the material elements, signified by the anvil and the stone.

Gurteen includes in his work a diagram of the Arthurian Epic Cyclus, according to the narrative of the Anglo- Norman trouveres. The figure is so important that we reproduce it herewith. The identification of Merlin with the intellect of the world is a simple and direct key to the Neoplatonism and Gnosticism underlying this entire cycle of legend symbolism. It will be seen from the diagram that an order of spiritual descent begins with Merlin, passes to Arthur, and is consummated in the maiden knight, Galahad. A parallel is found in the cycle of Grail kings, Titurel, Amfortis, and Parsifal, and in the Gothic descent of Odin, Sigmund, and Siegfried. Lancelot du Lac was the foster son of Vivienne, a nymph. She may be the same as the mysterious Lady of the Lake, who gave Arthur the sword Excalibur, which had been fashioned for him by Merlin in his subterranean forge. Lancelot, like Sigmund, was unable to accomplish the Quest of the Grail, because of his sin against the sanctity of marriage. Like Sigmund also, he became the father of a spiritual hero, in this case, Galahad. We cannot examine in detail the entire cycle, but if we understand Merlin to be the world-mind, and Arthur the world-form, then Galahad becomes the world-soul, and the legend unfolds its cosmic content.

In the Revolution, Cromwell's soldiery, after the capture of Win- chester, and in the fury at the imputed idea of idolatry (the Round Table is the English 'Palladium'), made a target of it. The marks of many balls are still conspicuous.\" The center of the Winchester table top is ornamented with a large heraldic rose of the conventional form asso- ciated with the house of Tudor. There are places for twenty-four knights arranged in pairs, and a double throne for the Grand Master and the mysterious unknown knight, or adept, who is worthy to sit in the Siege Perilous. Like the tomb of Father C. R. C., Arthur's Round Table is a microcosm or mirror of the universe. The knights met annually at Windsor, Winchester, Cam- elot, or Caerleon to celebrate the Pentecost. So exalted were these sanctified champions of the code of chivalry that not one could be given a seat above another. For this reason a circular table was constructed and dedicated to the Grail Quest. The table itself had magical powers and could enlarge its own size as the number of the virtuous increased. The number of persons who could be seated at the table differs in the several accounts. One writer says fifteen hundred, another, one hundred fifty.

Thirty-two chairs plus the Grail throne in the middle would give the highly significant num- ber thirty-three. Here is a possible Masonic intimation of thirty-two degrees earned and one bestowed by the \"grace of God.\" In one version of the legend, Merlin refers to the Round Table as the original board at which Jesus ate and drank with his disciples on the occasion of the Last Supper. Its mysteries were revived at the court of Uther Pendragon, from which it passed to Leodegrance, King of Came liard. In the tradition preserved by Geoffrey of Monmouth, Arthur's queen, Guinevere, is described as a Roman lady, but she is usually referred to as a lady of Cornwall and daughter of King Leodegrance. Arthur received the symbolic table on the occasion of his marriage, possibly as part of Guinevere's dowry. All the elements of the story have been intentionally or acci- dentally confused, but the implication is that the rites of the Round Table had descended directly from the celebra- tion of the Pentecost by Joseph of Arimathea at Glaston- bury. Sir Modred, the Judas of the Round Table, was born of an illicit union of Arthur and his own half-sister, Mor- gause, Queen of Orknay. Arthur did not know that Morgause was of his own blood, but he atoned for his sin by dying at the hand of his wretched and evil offspring. Lancelot, who failed to stand beside his king-emperor at the battle of CarnIan, finally died of a broken heart on Arthur's grave.

From the birth of Sir Modred the same note of inevitable tragedy dominated the theme that hung over the Odinic Rites. As the body of the dying Arthur was borne away after the battle of Camlan, it was left for Sir Bedivere to perform the last rituals of the Round Table. He carried the sword Ex- calibur to the shores of the lake and threw it far out over the water. A hand rose from the deep and, grasping the blade, carried it beneath the waves. The sword is the power of the will, human and divine, which returns to space from whence it came in the day that is called \"the twilight of the gods.\" Lord Tennyson then makes Sir Bedivere cry out: \"But now the whole Round Table is dissolved Which was an image of the mighty world.\" There are several accounts of the discovery of the grave of King Arthur. The most authentic of these records are those of Giraldus Cambrensis, who was present on the occasion, and William of Malmesbury, who lived at the time. When Henry II visited Wales, he learned from an ancient British Bard that King Arthur had been buried at Glastonbury, and that strange pyramid-monuments marked the grave. The king approached the monks of the abbey and further told them of a report that the remains of Arthur had been deeply interred, not in a stone tomb, but in a hollowed oak tree. An excavation was made between two pyramids or columns standing in the cemetery of the abbey. Under a stone was found a leaden cross, which Giraldus says he actually held in his hands. The cross was inscribed with ORDERS OF THE QUEST 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70 THE ADEPTS the words: \"Hie jaeet sepultus inclytus Rex Arthurus in insula Auallonia\" (Here lies buried the renowned King Arthur in the .island of Avallon). Beneath, at the depth of about sixteen feet, a coffin made of a hollowed oak was found and it contained bones of unusual size. Giraldus notes that the leg bone was three fingers longer than that of the tallest man present. The skull also was large and revealed the marks of ten wounds; nine of these had con- creted, but the tenth, a large and clean cleft, apparently was the mortal blow. The remains of Guinevere were found on the same occasion, and also those of Modred, Arthur's son and slayer. The bones were removed to the church at Glastonbury at the order of King Edward I, and were placed before the high altar. This king visited the abbey in 1276 and had the shrine of Arthur opened. After viewing the re- mains, Edward caused the bones to be folded into a magnifi- cent shroud and had them replaced with deep reverence. According to one historian, the three bodies were buried in the same tomb, one above the other, with King Arthur beneath the other two. According to Thomas Gale,\" Glastonbury was anciently surrounded by marshes and was called the Island of Avalon; that is, the island of apples, from the old British word aval. When Arthur was stricken by Modred on the field of Camlan, it is reported that he was carried to the Isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds by Argante the Fair. Gale, quoting Matthew of Paris, says: \"We do not know how he died; but as he is said to have been buried in the Abbey church of Glastonbury with an epitaph in this manner, so we believe him to remain there still, whence the line, 'Hie jacet Arthurus, Rex quon- dam, Rexque Fuiurus' [Here lies Arthur. a King that was, ~See Historiae Anglicanae Scriptores,"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"ORDERS OF THE QUEST 71 and a King to be], for some of the race of the Britons believe that he will live again and restore them from a state of servitude to liberty.\"* The epitaph supplies the last and most vital element in the compound of the culture hero. The \"hero of the world\" cannot die. He may retire to his tomb to sleep and to wait, but, like Charlemagne and Barbarossa, he will return to lead his people and re-establish the golden age. He is always identified with a glorious time long-past and a glorious time to come. The culture hero is the personifi- cation of the secret hopes and aspirations of the nation which invents him or bestows his qualities upon some histor- ical personage. He is the immortal-mortal. He dies many times for his people, and yet, by enchantment, he forever lives. It will not require a great deal of reflection to dis- cover in the legend of Arthur the conventional form of the adept tradition. The story is finished. Long before, Merlin the Wise had been captured in the spell of Vivienne and no longer guarded the destiny of the Round Table. 01,1t of the threads and remnants of this splendid mystery was fashioned the Order of the Garter (Guarder). In the Chapel of St. George, the knights of Christendom extended and over- lapped their swords to form a brilliant star of gleaming steel, Once they had the Black Book, which told the secrets of the divine right of kings, but one day the book vanished from among them. This Black Book was the sacred writing of Hermes on the conduct of princes, the constitution of a united world. All that remains is the chain of the Garter, with its pendant of St. George the Dragon Slayer, the white and the red roses, and the motto, Honi soit qui mal :I' pense (Evil be to him who evil thinks), on a narrow band of ribbon. \"S« The Arthurian Epic, by S.

Both father and son were enthusiastic Dantophilists, but it is the elder Rossetti whose contributions have the most direct bearing upon the descent of the esoteric tradition.

The researches of the elder Rossetti are of special interest when we realize that they were in print long before the concept of the descent of a secret doctrine through Euro- pean schools of adepts had any prominent exponents or apologists. He therefore anticipated, by some fifty years, the convictions of the Theosophical Society and the schools of philosophical mysticism which emerged in the last quarter of the 19th century. 72 THE ADEPTS 'See Lon.

A Secret Society, accord- ing to Rossetti, whose original is lost in the mysterious twi- light of Oriental religion, has continued from the earliest historical point at which its workings can be traced to exercise an almost universal influence on the condition of the civilized world. These Mysteries, which in Egypt, in Persia, and even in Greece and Italy, preserved the specula- tions of the wise from the ears and tongues of an illiterate multitude, passed, with slight but necessary modifications, into the possession of the early Christian heretics. The Gnostic schools of Syria and Egypt transmitted to their successors, the Manichaeans, a scheme of discipline, which they perpetuated with extreme caution and in the most veiled language, as secrecy became more and more necessary because of the increased centralization of power in the orthodox prelates in Rome. The Paulicians, whose opinions were for the most part Manichaean, preceded the more illustrious and more un- fortunate Albigenses in a secret warfare against spiritual as well as temporal tyranny. The celebrated Order of Templars, so widely diffused throughout Europe, so con- siderable by the rank and influence of its members, did not differ from the Albigenses in the secret object of their endeavors or the more important part of their mysterious rites.

The love poems and Love Courts of Provence and Toulouse were vehicles of political discussions, of active conspiracy, and of heretical opinion. The poet Dante was an initiate of this secret, political, social, philosophical, and religious Society; a champion of its means and ends. The proof is concealed in his Vita Nuoua, the Divina Commedia and its commentaries, in the Conoito, the De Vulgari Eloquentia, and others of his minor works. Petrarch and Boccaccio were agents of the same mysterious institution, and its rites and secrets can also be discovered by those having the proper key to the confused writings of Baron Emanuel Swedenborg. Needless to say, the Sullo Spirito, etc. created a minor tempest in the intellectual world. Arthur Hallam, speaking for all the skeptics, pronounces the ideas which it contains \"interesting, ingenious, and impossible.\" Let us bear in mind, however, that Professor Rossetti, himself a political exile, was nourished from childhood upon the pabulum of Italian socialistic idealism and secret assemblages. Both Petrarch and Dante admired Arnaldo Daniello, one of the most obscure of the Provencal poets. They called him the \"great Master of Love,\" but no one understood his songs, although it is known that he was a Troubadour. It is impossible to examine Le Roman de la Rose without realizing that it refers to an esoteric Fraternity.

Little is known of his early life except that he met the little girl whom he called Beatrice when he was about ten years old, and she was in her ninth year. It has seemed reasonable to assume from Dante's poetic works and his letters that his infatuation for Beatrice (Bice Portimari) was the dominant personal emotion in his life. She selected Simone de Bardi for a husband, however, and died before reaching middle age. In 1292 Dante married, and the union was blessed with two sons and one or two daughters. Although Dante involved many of his acquaintances and enemies, at least indirectly, in his poems, no line or passage has been found which seems to allude to his wife. Beatrice remains to the end the mistress of his heart and soul. For his involvements in the political conspiracies of the day, Dante was exiled from his beloved Florence, and spent the closing years of his life at Ravenna. He died of a fever, consoled by the mystical philosophy which had come to dominate his entire mind. Although Dante's fame is de- rived principally from his Divina Commedia, for our pur- poses the Vita Nuova links him most closely to the mystical speculations of the Troubadours. The Vita Nuova explains how the poet, meeting Beatrice while still a child, concealed his true love [mystical adora- tion] by inventing a false love [human affection].

Unimaginative commentators cannot appreciate the entirely reasonable process of using an actual person to personify a spiritual truth. Yet Dante's personal acquaint- ance with the lady was slight, and his use of her in his mystical writings occurs only after her death. Certainly Dante did not intend to imply that he actually wandered about heaven and hell with Virgil as an all-sufficient guide. If the poet could involve himself in an allegory, why could he not also involve Beatrice? Nor is it more difficult to include Petrarch's passion for his mysterious Laura or Boccaccio's erotic devotions in the same category. We con- cede that the transcendental import of Boccaccio's Decam- eron is not immediately apparent, but neither are the true meanings of Don Quixote de la Mancha and Gulliver's Travels.

There can be no reasonable doubt that the mystical rose of Apuleius, the alchemical rose of Flamel, the Troubadour rose of Jean de Meung, and the cosmic rose of Dante grew on a single stem.

Although the accounts reveal certain common elements, the details indicate that a central theme was enlarged and embellished over an extended period of time. The Grail Cycle, as it has descended to us, originated among the Troubadours, the jongleurs, and the jesters. In England the Grail Quest became the central object of the Knights of the Round Table. The Arthurian Cycle in tum inspired the rituals of the Garter. This noble Order cer- tainly belongs among esoteric Fraternities and Leagues of Chivalry, which perpetuated the secret doctrine of antiquity. Elias Ashmole wrote an extensive history of the Garter, and was himself an officer of the Order. Referring to St. George, the patron of the Garter knights, Ashmole wrote: \"It is recorded that King Arthur paid St. George, whose red cross is the badge of the Garter, the most particular honors; for he advanced his effigy in one of his banners, which was about two hundred years after his martyrdom, and very early for a country so remote from Cappadocia to have him in reverence and esteem.\" The reference to Cappadocia links the legend of St. George with the gene- alogy of the Grail Kings, for the Senaboriden originated in this region. The St. George of the Garter is certainly the Perseus of Greek mythology who rescued the virgin, Andromeda, from a sea monster. Although the dragon episode is emphasized by Jacobus de Voragine in the Golden Legend, the actual life of the Saint is so obscure and uncertain that he is listed among those reverenced persons whose acts are known only to God.

Several ancient communities claimed, for example, to possess the Holy Grail. It was supposed to have been in the keeping of the patriarch of Jerusalem in the 13th century, and the Christians of Con- stantinople, at about the same time, claimed that it was in their keeping. In the cathedral at Genoa, a green dish or vessel is preserved, which, according to the medieval Genoese, was the sacred cup. The vase or basin, which once contained the royal blood (Sangre Real), was sup- posed to have been carved from a gigantic emerald, which had once been the crest jewel of Lucifer. This glorious stone was struck from the helmet of the Prince of the Arch- angels by the sword of St. Michael, the champion of heaven, during the conflict which followed the revolt of the angels. The shining green stone fell into the abyss of outer space, where it remained until it was recovered by the angels and fashioned into the Holy Grail. The Emperor Napoleon I, a realist in matters religious, took the green vessel from Genoa to Paris, where he had it chemically tested. The highly-prized chalice proved to be green glass. The legend of the heavenly emerald is reminiscent of the account of the Smaragdine Tablet, traditionally believed to have been discovered in the tomb of Hermes by Alexander the Great. Unfortunately, this Hermetic Emerald has proved as elusive as Lucifer's crest jewel, and sober reflec- tion increases our admiration for the splendid inventions of the Troubadours. They were indeed universally learned, according to the measure of their times, for they drew upon a wealth of curious lore in the production of their wonder- ful and beautiful hero tales.

Here, according to the songs of the gentle singers, Joseph of Arimathea nearly two thousand years ago brought the holy chalice, which is now said to lie buried beneath Glastonbury Tor. The Abbey ruins represent the earliest Christian foundation in England. The first church was a little wattled building believed to have been erected by Joseph of Arimathea about A. D. 61. The great church, later built upon the site, and all the monastery buildings were destroyed by fire in A. D. 1184, but rebuilding started immediately. In the year 1191 the bodies of King Arthur arid Queen Guinevere were found on the south side of the Lady Chapel at Glastonbury. These royal remains were later placed in a black marble tomb close to the Abbey. This tomb survived until the 16th century. Around the legends of the Holy Grail in England were developed the rituals, symbols, and emblems of the Order of the Round Table. The circle of knights gathered about the Table, which was the mirror of chivalry, representing Jesus and his apostles at the Last Supper. There is nothing to indicate in the epic of the Round Table that the questing knights sought the Grail in the ruins of Glastonbury. Such inconsistencies, however, only reveal the unhistorical dimen- sions of the legend. From the Arthurian assembly, the Mysteries of the Grail kingdom passed to the Knights of the Garter, whose Order represented the secret kingdom of the heroes. In a familiar form of the story, Joseph of Arimathea, accompanied by a small retinue, reached England in the 1st century A. D.

Thus it would appear that two cups are involved in the legend: one, the chalice of the sacrament, and the other, the vase of the sacred blood. The Quest of the Holy Grail was the most important and most mysterious of the legends of the Orders of Chivalry. The knights of the Quest were supposed to be seeking a cup guarded by angels, which usually appeared to the pure of heart in a circle of splendid light and song, and veiled with a silken cloth. The blood of Christ, ever-flowing in the Grail, signified his true doctrine, and the cup which contained it was his Esoteric School, the chalice of his adepts. The search for the Grail was the spiritual adven- ture of regeneration, and the trials and tribulations of the knights concealed under veiled terms the story of initiation into the spiritual Mysteries of Christ. As von Eschenbach reports the legends, the Grail was also a miraculous cup of replenishment. It yielded all manner of food and drink., and all who hungered after righteousness were sustained by its bounty. This account is all the more remarkable when the same mystic-poet states that the Grail was not a cup or vessel, but a stone.

Arthur Edward Waite wrote extensively on the Orders of the Quest. In one book* he attempted a survey of the entire field. Harold Bayley, after pointing out numerous inconsisten- cies in Mr. Waite's approach, advances his own conclusions with considerable solid scholarship. The Hidden Church of the Grail was more than a mere pre-Reformation, Protestant motion; it was an esoteric Fraternity, a secular mystical communion, a conviction that the quest for truth was possible without benefit of clergy. This lodge of initiates, dedicated to the perpetuation of the universal religion and driven into obscurity by the dominant religious and political factions, existed secretly for many centuries subsequent to its disappearance from the sight of history. Alfred Nutt, in his Legends of the Holy Grail, quotes Helinandus, whose opinions reflect the esoteric cult of the Grail, thus: \"Christ Himself wrote the Book of the Holy Grail and save it naught else but the Lord's Prayer and the judgment on the woman taken in adultery.\" From this we may assume that the legends were held to be the most sacred tradition in Christendom and the true doctrine of Christ. It is not hard to understand that a dominant Church would oppose vigorously a sect claiming a spiritual authority superior to the apostolic succession. Persecution, however, could not destroy completely the Secret Schools; rather it scattered the initiates, and in this way spread the very doctrines which it sought to eliminate. The bishops of the Grail Church had no distinguishing clerical habit, and between the 13th and 17th centuries, they were wanderers upon the face of the earth.

The confusion of modem living obscures the descent of traditions, but thoughtfulness will discover the facts. \"The Glory of God,\" wrote Francis Bacon, \"is to conceal a thing, but the glory of the king is to find it out.\" 86 THE ADEPTS The Grail Kings It is difficult to formulate a brief statement of the origin of the Grail legend. Perhaps for practical purposes we may say that a philosopher and astrologer by the name of Flegetanis, while studying with the Arabs in their colleges at Toledo, compiled an account of the mysterious Grail. His records were discovered by Meister Guiot de Provins. This Guiot is the K yot of the German version. Guiot was a jongleur, which was one of the grades or divisions of the Troubadours. It was from this jongleur, who was in Maniz in A. D. 1184, that the celebrated Troubadour and Knight Templar, Wolfram von Eschenbach, who died about A. D. 1220, derived the inspiration for his Titurel. He was fol- lowed by Albrecht von Scharfenberg, who wrote Der [ungere Titurel about A. D. 1270. In the Titurel legends of Wolfram von Eschenbach, we have the source of the material used by Richard Wagner in the development of his Grail Cycle of music dramas.

His themes center around the mystery of the St. Grail and kindred myths. In his Mastersingers (The next inher- itors of the Minnesingers or Troubadours) he gives us Hans Sachs, the historic cobbler-poet. In Sachs we see a representative of the unnumbered paper-poets, printer- poets and other artisans who combined work with aspira- tion. Sachs was a typical Son of the Dawn, one of those whom Bacon terms Filtii Aurorae, men 'full of towardness and hope.' ,,* Although Hans Sachs served his apprenticeship as a shoemaker and practiced the trade throughout life, he had received a good education in Nuremberg, and traveled ex- tensively among the German cities.

It is customary to assume, as pointed out by Dr. Karl Rosenkranz, that there are three distinct Grail traditions: the Titurel tradition which originated in Asia, the Parsifal tradition which is French, originating probably in Provence or Anjou, and the Lohengrin tradition which originated in Belgium.

It is all most mysterious and confusing, but the inevitable conclusion is that the Grail legends are intimately associated with the descent of Asiatic and North African mystical Societies through that period now referred to as the Dark Ages. Several writers of the German school, with the thorough- ness for which the intellectuals of that nation are justly famous, have studied the Titurel and Der [ungere Titurel in an effort to discover what may be described as the descent of the Grail kings. Their conclusions are most stimulating if we penetrate the outward pseudohistorical reports. It is immediately evident that the history of the Grail is the symbolical story of the descent of the Gnosis in Europe. At the time the Roman Emperor Vespasian was laying siege to the city of Jerusalem, there was in his retinue Sennabor, Prince of Cappadocia, and his three sons: Parille, Azubar, and Sabbilar. Although Cappadocia was a Roman province, the root of the Senaboriden was in Asia. It should be noted that the names of these important Cappadocians had a distinctly Arabic flavor. Sennabor may be from the Arabic senber, meaning a sage. After the fall of Jerusalem, the sons of Sennabor were entertained at Rome, and Parille was given the daughter of Vespasian in marriage. Her name was Argusilla, or Orgusille. Perille also received properties in France, and his brothers were given Anjou and Cornwall. To Parille and Argusilla a son named Titurisone was born, and he is referred to as the \"stem of the Grail-race.\" Parille was ORDERS OF THE QUEST 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"poisoned when attempting to reform his people, and Tituri- sone became king. He married Elizabel of Arragonia, and their son was Titure1, the first of the Grail kings. Titure1, with the aid of the peoples of Provencal, ArIes, and Lo- tharingia, conquered the heathen nations of Auvergene and Navarre, and had many wonderful adventures in the ser- vice of the true faith. It was Titurel who was instructed by visions to build the temple for the preservation of the Holy Grail. The site was revealed to him by an angel, and so carefully hidden was this spot on the far side of the Pyrenees that none could discover it except by the aid of God. Like Odin's great Temple at Uppsala, the sacred shrine of Mont Salvat was built by miraculous means. By the grace of God, Titurcl lived to great age and was four hundred years old when the Grail Temple was completed. The Divine Power then instructed him to marry and establish a royal line. The wife chosen for him was a holy maiden, by name Richonde, whose father was the king of a Spanish province. There were two children. The son, Frimutel, became the second Grail king, and he in turn had five children, the eldest being Amfortis, who succeeded his father in the royal line. Among the children also was a daughter, Herzeloide (the sorrowing heart), who was the mother of Parsifal. There was another daughter, Urepanse, who is referred to in the legend as the mother of Prester John. Finally Titurel, having reached the age of nearly five hundred years, died in India, having warned both his son and his grandson that their lives would be filled with suffer- ing because they had not conquered their human frailties. Parsifal was King of the Grail for ten years, and after the death of his son Lohengrin, who was murdered, he also returned to Asia. It is important to note that although the Wagnerian Mystery-dramas imply that the Grail legend 90 THE ADEPTS"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"ORDERS OF THE QUEST 91 belonged in the Age of Chivalry, the only available date in the earlier forms of the tradition is that of the death of Lohengrin, which took place approximately five hundred years after the birth of Christ. An excellent summary of this story is to be found in Traces of a Hidden Tradition in Masonry and Medieval M ysticism J by Isobel Cooper-Oak- ley. In order to develop the Asiatic phase of the story, it would be necessary to examine the records of the N estorian Christians. This requires a complete program to estimate -·From Peking, by Abbe Favier JOHN OF MOUNT CORVIN Founder of the Catholic mission in China. the degree that Nestorianism and Manichaeanism mingled their streams with those of Indian Buddhism.

Christian missionaries of the Syrian Church are believed to have reached China as early as the 3rd century A. D. John Kesson of the British Museum, in defining what he calls the second epoch in the history of Christianity in China, writes: \"We approach the period when the Nestorian, or rather the Chaldean or Syrian Christians, as they call themselves, spread so rapidly, planting Christianity in the heart of Asia, carrying it to the remotest East, and giving rise to the belief that they entered the provinces of China early in the seventh century.\"* Pope Nicholas IV in 1289 sent a Catholic mission, under John of Mount Corvin, to the court of the great Mongol Emperor, Kublai Khan. The Ka Khan was a sincere and studious Buddhist, a patron of learning, and most tolerant and considerate of the Mohammedan and Christian sub- jects within his domains. In a letter, Father John of Mount Corvin, writing from the court of Kublai Khan, makes the following rather significant statement: \"A certain king of these regions, George, of the sect of the Nestorians, who belonged to the family of the great king who was called Prestor John, attached himself to me the first year that I was here, and, after he had been convinced by me of the truth of the Catholic faith, was received into the Ordines lll! inores and stood by me in royal vestments while I said mass.\" 92 THE ADEPTS In 1338 a delegation of sixteen persons sent by the Emperor of China arrived at the court of the Pope, who was then throned at Avignon. The emperor asked for the papal benediction, and further requested that the com- mission be allowed to bring back horses and other rarities of the West. Thus, although the Christian nations were comparatively uninformed about the beliefs of Asia, many ~See The Cross and the Dragon (London, 1854),"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Eastern sovereigns and princes possessed considerable in- formation, even at an early time, about the life of Jesus and the rituals of Catholicism. It would seem most unlikely that the Franciscan Father, John of Mount Corvin, manufactured the story of the Eastern king who was descended from the family of Prestor John. All the available records bearing upon the life of this good Father indicate that he was a man of the highest integrity. He further makes the simple statement that this king, whom he converted, was a N estorian. If a Christian Empire existed in Asia at an early time, it must have been under the influence of the Nestorians, if not actually founded by them. We may ask why Titurel, the Grail king, jour- neyed to Asia when his time came to die? Also, why did Parsifal take the Grail to the Far East at the end of his own reign? Nestorius, who flourished in the 5th century, was a victim of that same Cyril of Alexandria responsible for the martyr- dom of Hypatia, the mathematician. Cyril accused Nes- torius of heresy, and he was anathematized by a synod pre- sided over by Cyril and one hundred fifty-nine bishops. The synod was declared invalid by the emperor, because the accused bishop and his friends were never permitted a hear- ing. Thus Nestorius was one of the early victims of the political machinery of the Western Church. It is believed that he was influenced by Gnosticism and the sect of Manes. It would be quite reasonable, therefore, that if the Grail kingdom, itself under the ban of the Church, sought refuge in a distant land, it would choose a location dominated by conyictions similar to its own. The Nestorians, like the Albigensians, practiced a mystical communion and covenant outside the self-proclaimed Church of Christendom.

Eugene Aroux, the Cath- olic writer, favors this belief; and some have gone so far as to suggest that this book was the esoteric doctrine of the Templars and contributed to the Masonic tradition. It is evident that the story of Titurel and the symbolical gene- alogy of the Grail kings relate to the descent of Schools or Orders of initiates. Titurel represents the ancient wis- dom and, like the mysterious Father C. R. C., is the per- sonification of the Mystery Schools which serve the shrine of Eternal Truth. In the descent, the scene is gradually shifted from Jerusalem to Rome, and then from Rome to those areas in France which were the seats of the Albigenses. Although these heretics were scattered by the Crusade against them, led by the Dominicans, their power was never completely broken. At a later date, another interesting and mysterious person appeared in Provence. He, too, left a strange legacy of poetic quatrains, and was the greatest prophet of the modern world. In the opening of his pro- phetic centuries, Michael Nostradamus describes himself as seated upon a tripod, like the priestess of ancient Delphi. His verses, which have never been completely interpreted, were written in the Provencal dialect. To show that a body of lore continues through the centuries, extremely difficult to trace but linked definitely with the area under consideration, let us quote a few lines from a letter dated February 12, 1787, and addressed to a Theosophical-Masonic Society which met in Middle Temple, London. The letter was signed by Count Gra- bianka, one of the names assumed by Count Cagliostro. The letter is from \"the Society at Avignon,\" and one section reads: \"Yes, dear brethren, there exists a Society which the LORD JESUS CHRIST has formed. It was in the year 1779, and in the north of Europe, that he was pleased to lay the foundations thereof.

We know already, that one of them, who has nearly finished his first course, will very soon join us. The ensuing spring will bring back fifteen, and we expect many more brethren and sisters that we know will be called in the course of this year.\" Is it not curious that Cagliostro, the Grand Cophte of the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry, should be associated with the Brotherhoods of Avignon? Is it not equally interesting that it should be generally acknowledged that the flamboy- ant Count was an agent of the surviving but elusive Knights Templars? To top this unusual sequence of events, it should be mentioned that the Lodge which Cagliostro visited in London was dedicated to the Swedenborgian Rite of Freemasonry, and that Cagliostro appeared among them claiming that the Secret Society in Avignon was practicing the esoteric Masonry of Emanuel Swedenborg. This in- dustrious Masonic enterprise reminds us that in 1781 a Lodge of Masons was established in Paris for the purpose of uniting the Illuminism of Adam Weishaupt, the Bavarian esotericist, with the new mystical revelations of Sweden- borg. The roster of this industrious Lodge included the names of Count Cagliostro, Anton Mesmer, and the Comte de St.-Germain. By this circumstance, St.-Germain is shown to be profoundly involved in the Bavarian Illuminati, the Asiatic brethren, and the Secret Societies of Avignon. While the tradition may be confused and obscure, it is evident that we are confronted with the descent of a Secret School which existed from the beginning of the Christian era and formed an Esoteric Empire. This empire was known at one time as the Kingdom of the Grail, and was function- ORDERS OF THE QUEST 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 THE ADEPTS ing as a political force in Europe as late as the rise of Napoleon I. Nearly every important transcendentalist of the last thousand years can be traced as being affiliated with this hidden empire. Research will fill in the few and inconsequential breaks in this golden chain of initiates, but the Temple on the three peaks of Salvaterra remains hidden unless it is revealed by the will of God. Prestor John} the Phantom Emperor of the World In the year A. D. 1144, Hugo, Bishop of Gabala, reported that a certain John, who governed as priest-king in an in- accessible region of the Far East, had, together with his people, been converted to N estorianism. This John be- longed to the race of the three Magi (adepts), and so extra- ordinary was his wealth that he carried a scepter of pure emeralds. In this way the rumor spread about Europe that a mysterious Christian monk was the supreme ruler over the nations of Asia. From some remote fastness of the trans-Himalaya, the power of this man extended through- out the three Indies. In 1165, kings and princes of Europe, including Barbarossa, received letters and long documents from the Emperor of the East. In these epistles, the writer described himself as John the Presbyter, Priest of the Almighty Power of God and of Our Lord Jesus Christ. One of these letters to his friend, Manuel, Prince of Con- stantinople, opened with the words, \"I, Prester John. the Lord of Lords, surpass all under heaven in virtue, in riches, and in power. . . .\" In this document, Prestor John devoted considerable space to the description of his empire.

He was constantly waited upon by seven kings, sixty dukes, and three hundred sixty- five counts. Twelve archbishops sat at .his right hand and twenty bishops at his left. Yet, with all this grandeur, he was a modest and humble man who did not rejoice in worldly splendor, and chose only to be called Presbyter, even though his butler was an archbishop, his chamberlain was a bishop, and his chief cook was a king. Early travelers to the Far East brought back lurid accounts of this strange monarch, who maintained a stand- ing army of a million and a half warriors, and was complete master of the birthplace of the sun. Even Marco Polo returned with an extravagant story of a Christian Emperor of Tibet, whose colonies included Persia, Ceylon, and Siam, and whose powers were limitless. It is impossible to dismiss the story of Prester John as a mere fable, for legendary men do not write letters or send embassies. On the other hand, no account of this strange man is to be found in Oriental histories, which were amazingly comprehensive. Wolfram von Eschenbach was the most important of the medieval German poets, and was a Minnesinger. In his epic poem, Parzi[al, he connected for the first time the legend of the Holy Grail with the history of Prester John.

After the era of exploration, by which the boundaries and proportions of countries came to be known with greater accuracy, the location of Prester John's empire shifted from one inaccessible area to another, and finally was identified with Abyssinia. At the beginning of the 15th century, the Abyssinian-Christian priests described their kingdom as the land of Prester John. This story gained immediate popu- larity, and the princes of Europe sent ambassadors in search of him. Unfortunately, these men were never heard of again. The Negus of Abyssinia combined in his person certain temporal and spiritual powers, and the name of John occurs frequently in the list of the Abyssinian kings. This entire theory, however, was finally abandoned. The oldest map on which America is mentioned, dated 1507, placed the country of John the Presbyter in the area of Tibet. The following description appeared: \"This is the land of the good King and lord, known as Prester John, lord of all Eastern and Southern India, lord of all the kings of India, in whose mountains are found all kinds of precious stones.\"* In the first hundred years after the invention of printing, several books were published showing pictures of Prester John in his royal robes. Because of the lack of geographical data, many believed the boundaries of Abyssinia to extend to China. In fact, the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope was due principally to the efforts of the King of Portugal to communicate with Prester John.

Heeke- thorn was working in the right direction when he pointed out that the legend originated in the resemblance between Buddhism and Christianity. He explains that there was in China in the 12th century a great Mongol tribe professing Buddhism, which, by travelers, was mistaken for an Orien- tal-Christian religion. The Nestorian-Christians dwelling among the Mongols called the head of this Buddhist sect \"John the Priest,\" and hence arose the tradition that in the heart of Asia there was a Christian Church, whose Pope bore the title of Prester John. The original location given for the empire of Prester John was the area of the Gobi Desert, where he lived in an enchanted palace in the mountains. If you ask Eastern initiates to describe the Northern Paradise, called Dejung or Shambhala, the mysterious city of the adepts, they will tell you that it is in the heart of the Gobi Desert.
