[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Sword of Moses An ancient Hebrew/Aramaic book of magic Translated by M. Gaster, 1896 Note: Dr. Gaster omitted transcription of holy names, marking them X in the text. Text marked by [] added by J.H.Peterson. I. The Sword of Moses. In the name of the mighty and holy God! Four angels are appointed to the “Sword” given by the Lord, the Master of mysteries, and they are appointed to the Law, and they see with penetration the mysteries from above and below; and these are their names — SKD HUZI, MRGIOIAL, VHDRZIOLO, TOTRISI. [CQD HUZI MRGIZIAL, UHDRZIULU, TUTRISI] And over these are five others, holy and mighty, who medi- tate on the mysteries of God in the world for seven hours every day, and they are appointed to thou- sands of thousands, and to myriads of thousands of Chariots, ready to do the will of their Creator, X [AHI HI HIH], the Lord of Lords and the honoured God; these are their names — X [MHIHUGTzI PJDUThThGM, ASQRIHU, CIThINIJUM, QThGNIPRI]. And the Master of each Chariot upon which they are appointed wonders and says: “Is there any number of his armies?” And the least of these Chariots is lord and master over those (above) four. And over these are three chiefs of the hosts of the Lord, who make every day tremble and shake His eight halls, and they have the power over every creature. Under them stand a double number of Chariots, and the least of them is lord and master over all the above Chiefs (rulers); and these are their names — X [ASHHI CTRISHUIH SHUThGIAIH]. And the name of the Lord and king is X [PSQThIH], who sits, and all the heavenly hosts kneel, and prostrate themselves before Him daily before leaving X [GQTZ’’CLAH], who is the Lord over all. And when thou conjure him he will attach himself to thee, and cause the other five Chiefs and their Chariots, and the lords that stand under them, to attach themselves to thee just as they were ordered to attach themselves to Moses, son of Amram, and to attach to him all the lords that stand under them; and they will not tarry in their obeisance, and will not withhold from giving authority to the man who utters the conjuration over this “Sword,” its mysteries and hidden powers, its glory and might, and they will not refuse to do it, as it is the command of God X [ABDUHU] saying: “Ye shall not refuse to obey a mortal who conjures you, nor should you be different to him from what you were to Moses, son of Amram, when you were commanded to do so, for he is conjuring you with My Ineffable names, and you render honour to My name and not to him. If you should refuse I will burn you, for you have not honoured Me.” Each of these angels had communicated to him (Moses) a propitious thing for the proper time. These things (words) are all words of the living God and King of the Universe, and they said to him:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"— “If thou wishest to use this ‘Sword’ and to transmit it to the following generations, (then know) that the man who decides to use it must first free himself three days previously from accidental pollution and from everything unclean, eat and dring once every evening, and must eat the bread from a pure man or wash his hands first in salt (?), and drink only water; and no one is to know that he intends using this ‘Sword,’ as therein are the mysteries of the Universe, and they are practised only in secret, and are not communicated but to the chaste and pure. On the first day when you retire from (the world) bathe once and no more, and pray three times daily, and after each prayer recite the following Blessing: — “Blessed art thou [QUSIM], O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who openest the gates of the East and cleavest the windows of the firmament of the Orient, and givest light to the whole world and its inhabitants, with the multitude of His mercies, with His mysteries and secrets, and teachest Thy people Israel Thy secrets and mysteries, and hast revealed unto them the “Sword” used by the world; and Thou sayest unto them: “If anyone is desirous of using this ‘Sword,’ by which every wish is fulfilled and every secret revealed, and every miracle, marvel, and prodigy are performed, then speak to Me in the following manner, read before Me this and that, and conjure in such and such a wise, and I will instantly be prevailed upon and be well disposed towards you, and I will give you authority over this Sword, by which to fulfil all that you desire, and the Chiefs will be prevailed upon by you, and my holy ones will be well disposed towards you and they will fulfil instantly your wishes, and will deliver to you my secrets and reveal to you my mysteries, and my words they will teach you and my wonders they will manifest to you, and they will listen and serve you as a pupil his master, and your eyes will be illuminated and your heart will see and behold all that is hidden, and your size will be increased.” Unto Thee I call, X [SUQIM], Lord of the Universe.

Blessed art Thou, who understandest the secrets and revealest the mysteries, and art king of the Universe.’” A voice warn heard in the heavens, the voice of the Lord of heavens, saying: “I want a light (swift) messenger (to go) to man, and if he fulfils my message my sons will become proud of the ‘Sword’ which I hand over to them, which is the head of all the mysteries of which also my seers have spoken, that thus will my word be, as it is said: ‘Is not my word like as fire? saith the Lord’” (Jer. xxiii, 29). Thus spoke X [PGNININU GSIH], the lord of heaven and earth; and I, Assi Asisih and Apragsih [APRGSIH], the light (swift) messenger, who am pleased with my messages and delighted with my sending, ascended before Him, and the Lord over all commanded me: “Go and make this known to men who are pious and good and pure and righteous and faithful, whose heart is not divided and in whose mouth is no duplicity, who do not lie with their tongues and do not deceive with their lips, who do not grasp with their hands and are not lustful with their eyes, who do net run after evil, keep aloof from every uncleanness, depart from every defilement, keep themselves holy from contamination, and do not approach woman.” When the Lord ever all commanded me thus, I, X [ASSI ASS UAS IS- IH UAPRGSIH], the swift messenger, went down to earth, and I said on my way: “Where is the man who possesses all these that I should go to him and place this with him?” And I asked myself, and thought in my heart that there is no man who would do all this that I wished; and I found none, and it was heavy unto me. And the Lord over all conjured me by His mighty right arm, and by the lustre of His glory and His glorious crown, with an oath of His mighty right arm, and He conjured me, and the lord over all strengthened me and I did not fall. I thus stood up, I, X [ASSI ASS U ASIS IH UAPRGSIH], to put NN in the possession of the desired covenant, in the name of X [QMBGL- OQMH-UH ZRUMTzIH-IH IKRUQ-ZNUThIH IRPHU-JThIH QTzI UTzIHTz-IHTz- IHTz].” “This is the great and glorious Name which has been given as a tradition to man — X [IH BIH ATz AH BAH HUI HU HU UH IA HU ZH UH UH AH IH IHU HH IHU IHU AQP HI HH IIAH HH HAH HUAH HHUH HII HU HU HI], holy, glorious, glorious, Selah.

And the King of the Universe utters (this name) also in a different manner, thus — X. You swift messenger, do not tarry and do not frighten me, but come and do all my wants in the name of X, the great One, who sees and is not seen, AHVH, whose Ineffable Name is revealed to the heavenly hosts; and I conjure you by this Ineffable Name, such as it was revealed to Moses by the mouth of the Lord over all, X, the Lord Sabaoth is His name. Blessed art thou, O God, lord of mighty acts, who knowest all the mysteries.” And which are the letters which X communicated to Moses? He said to him: “If thou wishest to get wise and to use the ‘Sword,’ call me, and conjure me, and strengthen me, and fortify me, and say: ‘X, with the great, holy, wonderful, pure, precious, glorious, and awe-inspiring secret Name X, with these letters I conjure thee to surrender to me and make me wise and attach to me the angels which minister to the “Sword,” in the name of the Revealer of mysteries. Amen.’” Write with ink on leather and carry about with you during those three days of purification, and invoke before and after prayer the following Names communicated to Moses by Mrgiiel, X, by Trotrosi, X, etc. (the 13 Chiefs mentioned at the beginning, and a long string of other mysterious names which are said to have been communicuted to Moses). “And they have not hidden from him any of these sacred Ineffable names or letters, and have not given him instead the Substitutes of any of these sacred letters, for thus were they ordered by the Lord of all mysteries to communicate to him this ‘Sword,’ with these Names which constitute the mysteries of this ‘Sword’; and they said to him ‘Command the generations which will come after thee to say the following blessing prior to their prayer, lest they be swept away by the fire’: ‘Blessed art Thou, X, who wast with Moses; he also with me, Thou, whose name is X. Send me X, who is the cover of the Cherubim, to help me. Blessed art Thou, Lord of the Sword.’” Whoever is desirous of using this ‘Sword’ must recite his usual prayers, and at the passage “Thou hearkenest to prayer” say: “I conjure you four princes X, servants of Hadirion, X, that you receive my invocation before I pray, and my supplication before I entreat, and fulfil all my wishes through this ‘Sword,’ as you have done to Moses, in the glorious and wonderful name of the Lord of wonders, which is interpreted thus — X.” He must then call the five superior Chiefs and say: “I conjure you, X, that you accept my conjuration as soon as I conjure you, and you attach to me those four princes and all the hosts of Chariots over which you preside, to fulfil all my wishes through this ‘Sword’ by this beloved name X.” He must then call the three angels that are superior to these, and say: “I conjure you, X, the beloved of X, who is Hadiririon, that you attach yourselves to me and attach to me X, who are standing under your rule, to fulfil all my wishes through this ‘Sword’ by this unique name X.” And then he must lay hold of the highest Chief over all and say: “I conjure thee, X, strong and powerful Chief over all the heavenly hosts, that thou attachest thyself to me, thou and not thy messenger, and attach to me all the Chiefs that are with thee, to fulfil my wishes through this ‘Sword,’ by the name X, which has no substitute, for thou art beloved and he is beloved, and I am from the seed of Abraham called the beloved. Blessed art thou, King of the mysteries, Lord of the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"secrets, who hearkenest unto prayer.” And he is not to touch this “Sword” ere he has done all these things; afterwards he will be able to do whatever he likes, everything being written here following in its proper order. II. This is the “Sword.” [It consists of a series of mysterious names of God or angels, to which the recipes in Part III refer. The first list commences with Tobat, Tsbr, etc. (1-5). These numbers are added by me to make the formulas run parallel with their magical applications in Part III, as already explained in the Intro- duction. I refer to them as they break up this part in convenient smaller portions, and are easily discernible. After these follow the words]: “With these your Names, and with the powers you possess, to which there is nowhere anything like (I conjure you) to show me and to search for me, and to bring me X to do all my bidding in the name of X,” and, again, a list of names, that have no special charac- teristic in common. Nos. 20-24 are all names commencing with JJ; some of these finish with JH. 24- 36 all these names have the word Sabaoth attached to them. To 41-47 HVH is added. From Nos. 51- 93 all the names are composite; they appear as names of sons, the name of the father being added to each of these, close upon 160 names, e.g.: Sagnis, son of Srngia; Ssgn, son of ‘Arggis; Atumi, son of Batumi; Ahsuti, son of Kkthus; Agupi, son of Abkmi, etc. Every name from 102 on to the end of this part finishes with -el, after which follow varying syllables and words: some are only JH or JV (Nos. 102-105), or a word commencing with ‘A- and finishing with -JH (Nos. l06-lll). Nos. 112-121 are followed by ARVH, whilst 122-l27=JHVHH, and Nos. 128-134=HVJH. They conclude with the following words: “Ye sacred angels, princes of the hosts of X, who stand upon the thrones prepared for them before Him to watch over and to minister to the ‘Sword,’ to fulfil by it all the wants by the name of the Master over all; you Chiefs of all the angels in the world, X, in the name of X the seal of heaven and earth, ministers of X the most high God; through you I see X in the world; you are lording over me in all the place of the Master over all: I pray of you to do everything that I am asking of you, as you have the power to do everything in heaven and upon earth in the\\ name of X, as it is written in the Law, ‘I am the Lord, this is My name!’” III. 1.

III. R. Akiba asked R. Eliezer the great: “How can one make the Angel of the Presence de- scend upon earth to reveal to man the mysteries from above and beneath, and the speculations of the foundations of heavenly and earthly things, and the treasures of wisdom, cunning, and help?” He said thereupon to me: “My son! I once made him come down, and he nearly destroyed the whole world, for he is a mighty prince and greater than any in the heavenly cohort, and he ministers oontinually before the King of the Universe, with purity and separation, and with fear and dread of the glory of his Master, because the Shekinah is always with him.” And he said to him: “My master, by the glory which thou hast bestowed upon me, I conjure thee to instruct me how to attach him to me.” (And he replied) : “In that hour when I wish to attach him to me and to employ him, I sit and fast on that very day ; but prior to it one must keep oneself free for seven days from any nocturnal impurity, and must bathe in the fountain of water, and not speak at all during those seven days, and at the end of this purification, on the day of the fast, he must sit in the water up to his throat, and before he utters the conjuration he must first say: ‘I conjure you, angels of dread, fear, and shaking, who are appointed to hurt those who are not pure and clean and desire the services of my heavenly servants — I conjure you in the name of X, who is mighty over all, and rules over all, and everything is in His hands, that you do not hurt me, nor terrify me, nor frighten me; verily, in the name of the powerful, the head of ...’ After this he may commence his conjuration, for now he has fortified himself and has sealed himself with the name of God of 42 letters, before which all who hear it tremble and are frightened, and the heavenly hosts are terror-struck. He must then again conjure, and say: ‘X, chief, who of all the de- stroying angels is the most hurtful and burning, with this Name and in this way I call thee AVZHIA, angel of the Presence, youthful minister before the King of the Universe, who art a prince and chief of the heavenly hosts; I conjure thee and decree upon thee that thou attachest thyself to me to fulfil my wish and to accept the decree of my conjuration and to accomplish my desires and fulfil my wishes, and do not frighten me, nor terrify me, nor overawe me, and do not make my frame shake and my feet vacillate, nor cause my speech to be perverted; but may I be fortified and strengthened, and may the conjuration be effective and the (sacred) Name uttered properly by my throat, and may no"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"vacillation take hold of me and no trembling of the feet by thy ministering angels confuse me and overawe me, and weaken my hands, and may I not be overcome by the fire and flame of the storm and whirlwind which precedes thee, O wonderful and exalted one, whose Ineffable name is X, of whose wrath the earth trembles, and nothing can withstand his anger, twice blessed. Again I conjure thee by thy 14 (!) names by which thou didst reveal thyself to thy prophets and seers, to place in their mouths sweet words of prophecy and to utter pleasant words; and these are the Ineffable names and their surnames (Kunya): Spirit Piskonnit, kunya, X; Atimon, kunya, X; Piskon (?), Hugron, kunya, X; Sanigron, kunya, X; Msi, kunya, X; Mokon, kunya, X; Astm, kunya, X; Sktm, kunya, X; Ihoaiel, kunya, X; lofiel, kunya, X; Ssnialiah, kunya, X; Kngieliah, kunya, X; Zabdiel, kunya, X.

And two are engraved upon the crown of the most exalted and high King, and these they are — X, before whom every knee bends and every mouth utters praises; X, besides him there is no God and helper.

Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever. And all praise and extol thy Name, for they love thee. I conjure thee, and decree upon thee firmly, not to disobey my words, and not to alter my decree and my decision with which I conjured thee, and decreed upon thee, and established in peace. In the Name X, blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever, depart in peace, and do not frighten me in the hour of thy departure; in the name X, Lord, most high and holy, in the name of the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel’s battalions; in the name of the holy living Creatures, and in the name of the Wheels of the Chariot, and in the name of the river of fire, Ih, Zii, Ziin, and all His ministers, and in the name of IH, Ziin, Sabaoth, Z, El Z, Shaddai Z, X revealed Himself on Mount Sinai in the glory of His majesty. “‘With these Names, terrible and mighy, which darken the sun, and obscure the moon, and turn the sea, and break the rocks, and extinguish the light, I conjure you, spirits, and . . and Shiddim, and Satanim, that yen depart and disappear from N, son of N.’” APPENDIX II.
