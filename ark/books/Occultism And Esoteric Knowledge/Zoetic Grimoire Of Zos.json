[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE ZOË TIC GRIMOIRE OF ZOS The Formulae of Zos vel Thanatos By Austin Osman Spare First Formula: Of the White Sabbat h — as first told me by a Witch ARGUMEN T: Actually there is neither a Black nor a White Sabbath: the e thical criterion of all acts is whethe r they are anti - social or so motivated. Where two o r m ore of a kind of equal maturity and inclination enact for consumm ation, then, if harm they do it is only to themselves — which I doubt — and far less harm ful than the practices of those who mutilate or deny their bodies in the name of a culture or a religion. The latter are invariably prophets or propagators of sterility, whereas the one outward tenet of Witchcraft is s ilence to \"unlike others\". The Sabbath is an inverse - reversion for self - seduction, an undo ing for a divertive conation. Sex is used as the techn ique and medium of a magical act. There is not only erotic s atisfaction; the sensualist is made detached and controlled until final sublimation; his whole training is s ubmissive and obedient until, by c old amoral passion, he can transmute control and d ivert him - or herself where desired. The Witch so engaged is old, grotesque, worldly and libidinously learned and is sexually attractive as a corpse; yet she becomes the e ntire vehicle of consumm ation. This is necessary to transmute the personal aesthetic c ulture. Perversion is used only to o vercome moral prejudices or conform ity; the mind and d esire must become amoral, focused and made e ntirely acceptive so that the life - force is free of inh ibitions prior t o the control. Thus, the Sabbath becomes a deliberate sex - orgy for the purpose of materialization: the Great Reality of 'as if' (wishful thinking). Sex is fully exploited: he who injures none, himself does not injure. Finally: a culturally accepted criteri on h as destroyed more affective affinity than any other belief; but he who transmutes the ugly into a new aesthetic has something beyond fear. For the e thical pragmatist I can assert that this form ula has never harm ed me; on the contrary, by improved healt h and self - control it has made me tolerant, understanding and compassionate. It inspires and promises more than probability as possible, and is the only thing that has made reality magical and the magical, reality. Pleasure is in us and around us... now I be ckon and it cometh unto me. FORMULA : This is always s ecret, comm unal and p eriodic; an enforced consumm ation for almost unlimited wish - fulfillment by lengthy voluntary abstinence, repression"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and sacrifice until release by mass s exual saturation, for one pur pose: the exteriorization of a wish by a great saving and a total spending. The hypereroticism induced b y this grand - scale hysteria or saturnalia has an essentially sado - masochistic basis. Previous to the ceremony each celebrant has his or her allotted p ar t, although it usually ends promiscuously and chaotically. The initiates are trained singly in their own parts and in the response e xpected of them. They play a passive role, for the promise of untold ecstasy. The Witches take the active part throughout : t hus the symbolic levitation by besom - handle. There is a meeting - place and an elaborate ritual which is an extensive hypnotic to o ver - ride all i nh ibitions. Thus, smell, hearing and vision are seduced b y incense and mantra (incantation and the ritual - ceremon y), while taste and touch are e nh anced b y the stimuli of wine and oral acts. After complete sexual satiation by oral, anal, or urethral means, there appears an exteriorized hallucination of the predeterm ined wish which is magical in its reality. No o ne can say precisely whether certain things happen or not, although each person may have very different and equally vivid experiences. Some form of levitation seems c omm on to all. My own experience of many Sabbaths is that there is consumm ate e xteriorization and that subsequent memories are of reality. All excessively sadistic acts are usually symbolized b y g enuine Witches, but what simulation there is is c omm on to most erotic rights. The whole ceremony is based mainly on inverted orthodox religious s ervices. DOC TRINE AND CREDO \u0000 Fornicatus benedictus!

The autotelic wish into heterotelic c onception is by concumm ation through using an urn of correct shape and d imension which must correlate nearly to that of the lingam used — so that there is s ufficient vacuu m.

This is the most form idable form ula known, never fails and is dangerous — hence what is not written must be guessed. From this form ula was derived the le gend of the Genii of the Brazen Vesse l as related b y Solomon. Third Formula: The Comm union of Auto - Ego of Zos This form ula is based on that of Apollonius the Pythagorean philosopher and theurgist, and is the only magical means of inseparation and p sychic h elp that has no disastrous aftereffects whether it fails or succeeds."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"There is nothing simpler than speaking to your inmost self, and nothing more difficult. The first conditions are Secrecy, Silence and Solitude. Next, a means of comm unication: I created my own Alphabet and Language based on the primal onomatopoeia of language which is now — for m e — a subconscious quality which expresses only by high emotionalism. Indeed, the active link b etween all images of thought are intro - audile and of this c haracter on which one \u0000 s psychic language must be based. The Soul responds to the basic language only. Finally, ease of body and mind must obtain, the mind b eing free from all concepts — except the Desire, which should b e altruistic (others or yourself).

Fourth Formula: H ow to return Evil to i ts S ource Sorcery may be good or evil, as predeterm ined b y its purpose, and is your re sponsibility. Corrective punishment, being amoral, is the only legitimate motivation. Ability is the determ ining factor of success. Sufficient hate is the potency, which must be stored up, form ulated and focused so as to become incarnate through the e lemen tal employed to pierce the protective aura of the offenders. Requisites: something personal belonging to the victim or victims. A symbolic replica of them (drawing, statuette, etc.). Also, the deployment of an animal familiar, and a simulation of the deed and d esired consequences form ulated as a ritual convincing to yourself. There is also a direct method b y suggestion, when knowing the offenders \u0000 \u0000 Achilles Heel \u0000 . Evil in others may be made potent against them. Fifth Formula: Of Fortune Telling by Ca rds (Fo retelling by Fami liars) Foretelling the future by cards or other m eans: What is of consequence, and portentous, is the \u0000 state of mind \u0000 that is induced in the consultant by the method and d ownright explanations given to him: there is an indirect or transpos ed auto - suggestion. Anything so entering the near - subconscious must reform ulate and re - suggest itself with comm itment to a later, similar, event. Likewise, the sorcerer \u0000 s s haft pierces through the protective aura by assertion becoming indirect suggestion a s the consultant \u0000 s own. Paradoxically, the quickest way of susceptibility is by denial as disbelief. Cards may be used for form ulating the will, casting spells, mathematical numerology, and fortune telling. I was taught quite e arly in life by the greatest Witch of recent years. Here is a rough synopsis of my form ula based on what I remember of hers. First I need certain conditions: Silence, and light just sufficient to work b y. I even close my eyes when shuffling and always do so before handing the cards to the querent for re - shuffling."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"To begin with I used ordinary playing cards but soon found it expedient and of greater service to make my own packs, using sixty cards. Divided as usual into four suits, the Court cards representing people. The different suit s represent the comm on factors of life, i.e., business, social relations, objects, events, and emotional qualities, etc., no individual card having itself much significance. I am giving only g eneral principles; I shall not repeat what may be gleaned from a summ ary of books on the subject. Events and all else are given importance, in degree, by simple or m ore complex combinations of similar or r elating cards. Illustration: The two o f Spades means s imply \u0000 slight indisposition \u0000 ; the nine of Spades means \u0000 ann oy ance \u0000 or \u0000 pain \u0000 ; the ten of Spades means \u0000 sorrow \u0000 . Thus, these cards in that order m ean \u0000 serious illness \u0000 . If the card representing the enquirer is there, it means their own illness, and with the card representing \u0000 fatality \u0000 for good or evil (reverse or ot herwise), it could mean death. A different arrangement or sequence of the same cards would give a different equivalent, extended meaning, or definition. Thus, the two o f Spades isolated from similar cards could mean \u0000 slight illness \u0000 , \u0000 faintheartedness \u0000 , or \u0000 reluctance \u0000 etc., depending on which other cards it \u0000 falls \u0000 against. The cards s hould not be too ambiguous and should b ecome definite and d ifferent by combination. This is sufficient inform ation for beginn ing to create the \u0000 meanings \u0000 of cards, the only d ifficulty being to give appropriate meanings to individual cards s o as to have a complete vocabulary capable of covering all exigencies. Start with what you can manage and b uild up b y constant addition and rectification. Combinations are endless — always mak e them r ational. The more rare the e vent, the greater the number of cards necessary to the combination. It takes months of work to create a really rational pack. Start with playing cards, writing y our m eaning on them. Later, make your own pack and d raw you r own symbols — geometrical shapes will serve. Be original — it gives the best results. My own four cards mentioned above: Methods of laying out cards are numerous. The best, for general prediction, is serpentine: reading from left to right in rows of nine car ds. Synopsis: I do a short horoscope by laying eleven rows of five cards, each row relating to: House, Love, Self, etc., — every four rows being relative to each other... [one or two words illegible here] and answer to wish. The five cards left over indicate the imm ediate e vent. Make your own rules and k eep them, consistency in this c ase being a great virtue. It is possible to predict anything, but special packs with their special meanings have to be made, a difficult and laborious task. Alternative Fifth For mula: Techn ique of Fortune Telling First obtain a good b ook on \u0000 fortune telling \u0000 by playing cards. This will give you a general idea for the making a suitable pack for your own purposes. Procure a pack of ordinary playing cards and mark them, top and b otto m (cards have a reverse). Rely on the \u0000 book \u0000 only for general direction and method — the remnants of a traditional and lost art. You should evolve your own meanings, symbols and methods. This is v ital. Here are the salient points to note:"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Individual cards ar e indicators, not events — at least, not the important ones, and so we make separate cards mean the small comm onplaces — emotions and abstracts (love, hate, fear, etc.); \u0000 people \u0000 are indicated b y the Kings and Queens, and \u0000 children \u0000 by the two Knaves. The diff erent suits s ymbolize the different kinds of events or emotions, etc. Thus, Spades relate to sickness, mourning, death, disappointment, fear, hatred. Hearts indicate love, marriage, friendship, happiness, generosity. Diamonds indicate money, success, fame, honour. Clubs indicate business, officialism, power, knowledge. You will find fifty - two cards more than adequate to cover the small meanings. There are a number of meanings that do not fall under any one suit in particular, such as \u0000 speedy \u0000 , \u0000 accidental \u0000 , \u0000 legal \u0000 , etc.; these should b e placed in any suit where there is room. Put similar m eanings on one card, such as \u0000 conclusion \u0000 and \u0000 death \u0000 . The reverse of a card means the same thing but more intensely or extensively. Thus: \u0000 slight sickness \u0000 , reversed, wou ld mean \u0000 real sickness \u0000 . Also, a special card is made to intensify any card it falls against; reversed it means \u0000 continuous \u0000 or \u0000 regular \u0000 . It is the combination of certain cards that indicates the meanings of the more important events and episodes of life. For example: a combination of Spades — \u0000 Nine \u0000 , \u0000 Ten \u0000 , and \u0000 Ace \u0000 — when so closely juxtaposed would mean death very soon and, in combination with cards meaning \u0000 accident \u0000 , \u0000 sickness \u0000 , \u0000 hate \u0000 , would mean death by accident, sickness, murder or suicide, and so o n , covering every possible e vent. The mathematical computations of fifty - two cards are almost limitless. Write your m eanings and p rincipal combinations on the cards, and when you have fully memorized them change them into symbols — even if your imagination ca nn ot suggest more than geometrical signs. This change to s ymbols is ve ry important. To save overloading the cards with writing or symbols, write down a list of the rarer combinations and their m eanings. Study (from books on fortune - telling) the different m ethods of laying out the cards for reading; ultimately y ou will evolve the method that suits you best. My method is s imply to lay them out in a line (or four lines of thirteen cards) and read from left to right, but it is difficult and only adepts s ucceed. This is my process: First t he operator m ust shuffle the cards whilst looking into the e yes of the querent. The pack is then passed to the querent with a request to shuffle whilst thinking about whatever he desires to know. Then lay out the cards and read, special note being made of the juxtapositions of combinations. When close together it means the e vent will occur soon. However m any combinations there are you will always find some of unique and baffling meaning, and this is where the actual skill of the operator comes in. The solving of the problem(s) will be found far m ore interesting than any crossword puzzle. Imaginative methods help. A simple illustration: One card means \u0000 fear \u0000 and the other \u0000 honour \u0000 . This c ould b e read as meaning that the person in q uestion is \u0000 fainthearted \u0000 but has the necessary ability, as"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"against \u0000 he fears for his honour \u0000 — if it does not seem to be implied b y other factors. Remember, there is a rational and true interpretation if you can find it. Whether you believe in the subject o r not it should b e apprehended as you would approach any other Art or Science — with an open mind. As to the attitude of the querent, his belief is imm aterial but he should b e willing to be unprejudiced; any facetiousness is fatal. I can assert — judging by th e results of others who have used this method — that any person of norm al intelligence who follows c arefully these suggestions and who uses his imagination, with sufficient practice, will be able accurately to predict future e vents. Don \u0000 t expect too much too soon. I have not only had the characters of persons accurately described, but even their hidden physical marks. Education h as little to do with this faculty. In conclusion: it should take about six months to create a satisfactory pack of cards, and anothe r six months to gain the necessary facility by practice. There is no limit to what may be predicted, using special packs. Finally, scientists will never prove or disprove anything relating to \u0000 foretelling the future \u0000 ; it is a work for great artists. But sc ience may subsequently confirm m ore fully what t he artists have already discovered. Note well: all the indications essential for the Psychic Knowledge necessary for developing this s pecialized ability are given in The Logomachy. Sixth Formula: Metamo rph ose s by \u0001 Death Posture \u0001\u0003\u0002 by \u0001 Zeno of Elea \u0001\u0005\u0004 Powers of visualization, self - discipline and concentration are the qualities necessary. All magical practice, to be e ffective, needs great courage. By means of the Death Posture, total transportation of consciousnes s into the sex - centre occurs. This brings about pure aesthesis and the creation of a new sexuality by autotelic c oncept: the subsequent ecstasy is a sublimation. Because e very other sense is brought to nullity by sex - intoxication, it is c alled the \u0000 Death P osture \u0000 . Everything is 'a priori' to the act. The 'a posteriori' illumination reveals the inter - sexual correspondences of all things, and great emotiveness becomes... My desires have made a sentient soul, an obsession, a vampire, an insatiable negress of p endulous breasts and fatted thighs riding me into the abysses of the quadriga sex ualis... Seventh Formula \u0006 \u0001 Transcend ental P erspective \u0001 as a me ans of me diumship and anoëtic analgesia — as related to me by t he Stoic , Socrates Many Stoics lived b efore Zeno and they form ulated this s entiment as a practical and ideal behaviourism: There is in their genesis an h ierarchy of form and ideas.

This total effluxion makes everything reciprocal and becomes a re - orientated sequence of focused nexity. Th rough this harm onic relation with Ego o ne becomes the qualitative mediator of the hypothetical or real propensity: any position giving vastness or panorama, and, by abstractive gazing beyond d istance, allowing and following the flow of thought until there is an intrusive and more cognate idea. This idea is held and p rojected into the \u0000 vista \u0000 . Nothing inn ate is perm itted to be subtracted from the visualization. Eighth Formula: Formula of Arrivism AFF IRMATION C REE D OF THE ARRI VIST: I am God, and all other god s are my imagery. I gave birth to myself. I am m illions of form s excreating; eternal; and nothing exists except through me; yet I am not them — they serve me. I am inconceivable because I make the conceivable as I so will. I am beyond Law, for m y casualness rationalizes all things to my pleasure. I am the stranger, ever. We, the new Arrivists have a lusty heritage from the hierocracy of ancient Egypt, and such great familiars as Lao - Tzû, Pythagoras, Sappho, Socrates, Zeno and others who have substantiated the ir beliefs (and like them we have been spat on by the ugliest denominators): our great copula is the giving. \u0000 Arrivism \u0000 form ulates from our integrals: our \u0000 thisness \u0000 into \u0000 as if \u0000 becoming \u0000 as now \u0000 — the intentional becoming extentional; action by spontaneity conform ing everything critical and subvertive to itself, which is the mechanism of evoking our \u0000 thisness \u0000 . \u0000 As now \u0000 has no pendency: things are, because we are always the potential of what we last were. The gospel of the Arrivist is always his own. HOW T O TRAP A N ARRI VIST FA MILIAR TO E ARTH THE ELEMEN TAL : The best person to choose would b e of the \u0000 arrivist type \u0000 — those cocky bastards who seem to o btain all they need whenever they want it. Being intense egocentrics they are mediumistic or susceptible only to silent suggestion... So, look into their eyes and convey to them silently that they are the media for the transit of the obsessing elemental desired. They act simply as s omething en rapp ort between you and the e lemental. To make yourself acceptive and fit for obsession — acts of sacrifice and p urgation are e ssential beforehand. Also, the elemental must be named and given an appropriate Sigil."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Query to great arrivism: behold everything in the self. Thou art this and all that exists — but here \u0000 s the catch — neve r a t one time. Mind is universal and includes; Ego separates. \u0000 That art Thou \u0000 never is... always. I was or may become this, and only \u0000 I am \u0000 in Ego, often losing self - consciousness. I behold multiplicity in all things, and myself as the interrelating oneness, for whatsoever else I conceive will l ead me astray or into \u0000 as if \u0000 . The more I get into things, the more I am beyond them, so, the more within the more without. I am everywhere present yet unknown to myself except in Ego. I am a configuration of all the mu ltitudinous compositions and d esigns of this universe, and, knowing not myself fully, how can I know much of other selves and the Gods? But the man we know is mainly made from his beliefs as he e nacts them, for \u0000 being \u0000 is a function of the all - remembering Soul. So, believe from your necess ities, which alone obtain response and recompense — whether good or evil. Ninth and Last Formula: The Theurgy of Zos Believing, like breathing, is inveterate whereas \u0000 faith \u0000 is a compulsory acceptance for escape... a comm itm ent to an established thesis — often in conflict with our Ids, beliefs and habits. I, the resurgence of the Apostate Julian, am now the Iconoclast of Theocrasia, for I would have you create a new Pantheism — different Gods and the Great Inn ocence. Theses: On S orcery Our entire means of expression (of agreed meanings) i s s emantical, an ambiguous method, whether conveying ideas, values, facts or fictions, which h as ever - variant meanings to the recipient; there are few \u0000 one to o ne \u0000 meanings of words. Therefore, al though I may transfer by a short sentence a meaning similar to both of us, I do not so convey it t o my subconsciousness — there is conjunctional confusion. Example: The short sentence \u0000 God is love \u0000 , would b e to the subconsciousness either \u0000 god love \u0000 , or \u0000 lov e god \u0000 . Therefore, to be understood b y the subconsciousness it would have to read as \u0000 God=love \u0000 , and of course this would have to be believed (on your part) to have meaning: lip avowal here has no value for m agical transferences. Moreover, the conveyance o f such statements is unn ecessary and should b e in the form of a q uestion, not an answer. Symbolized: meaning: \u0000 Is God love? \u0000 Any fact or fiction h as no difficulty in finding relatables as s upporting evidence because e verything has a \u0000 point of conn ection \u0000 and a period of reality when"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"instantly and simultaneous to time and p lace. Our difficulty is to re - evoke \u0000 as now \u0000 : so we accept semblance of (i.e. make - belief, religion or faith) as s ubstitute of real belief (which n eeds no o ther r eality than its own: wha t you cann ot conceive as yourself is yourself (as another reality). Abstract or concrete: if you suggest a wish to the thing y ou desire of, in their own mann er, there will be a response: So, if I ask my mind in an appropriate mann er for a definition of \u0000 co nsciousness \u0000 I shall receive a true answer, although I may not be able to translate it: semantics are e ither r emiss or insufficient to render the sequence of phonographs, but (without understanding) I would receive an emotional impact, like from a signific ant passage of music (of Bach or Mozart) thus inspire a kind of semantic rendering. (As true as possible.) Magic: Belief conjures the Will, becomes the courage, taking its own moral or physical colour. Desire seeks all essential affixes — the only necessity is s incerity. Importance lies in things \u0000 as now \u0000 . Flesh exists to be e xploited. It is in all things and all things will be through it. All emanations are through the flesh and nothing has reality for us without it. The Soul is ever unknowable because we ca n only realize by finite form in Time - Space. So, whatever you attribute to the inconceivable is your Ego, as c onceived. The mind and its great thought - stream determ ines everything and p erm its all things c onceivable as possible. This thought - stream r efracts illations both from the Soul and from ourselves into o ur time - sense — images and symbols which inspire us from the inter - relatabilities, and our r eactions form our future destiny of good and evil with thought the nexus to all things past and b ecoming. Wheth er the gods c reated us or we created them is of no import except as an expedient. Magic is now a q uasi - charlatanism seeking victims: magicians have become coprophagists having the most corrupt collection of gleanings and remnants ever given that name. Too long ago its principles were lost, scattered or vulgarized, the symbols losing parallelism and truth. The doctrine lost pageantry, and the rituals became haphazard — the thing itself without inn er m eaning. As now, Magic adopts an erotic egocentricism as s ecr et meaning, hence there are no Magicians with any simple thesis of the great inn er Truth — only a rag - bag remains of this \u0000 wonder \u0000 cult. But, one cann ot dismiss modern magicians s o easily. Yes and no, there is s omething in most things and little e nough in mu ch, if any. Ability to enact is the denominator of our Truth. All parasitical longing seeks flesh to feed on... whether by magic or otherwise. The deliberate transference of a desire by symbols and sigils with their m eanings to the subconsciousness, thus s ublating them from the conscious, is a magical act. It works on the thesis that the subconscious is \u0000 all knowing, all memory \u0000 , and, being universal can \u0000 tap \u0000 any source of knowledge. The veriest moron, even, may have dreams as wonderful as those of a geniu s, whatever their difference of level. Dreams are a \u0000 mental conation \u0000 , unrecognized as perfect artistry.

A desire for a particular thing appears as c onscious requirement and, whatever the difficulties, with sufficient determ inati on you will obtain it: there is no apparent need for m agic. The premise is usually weak b ecause of false values. Thus, acquiring a book on sorcery does not make one a magician. The esse ntial abstract requirement is aptitude. Hence all the occult books in t he world may give you little knowledge, except as a parrot, and, as more often h appens, the ability to do less.

All thoughts, beliefs, actions are as mine, and this does not i mply any equality, superiority or inferiority in my relationships. These levels are rendered d ifferent by other differences, for I have discovered the by - passing of generalities — the way of differentiation, not by revolt, submission, resignation, or any suc h chicanery or bargaining, but by the e fferent acceptance o f all things. I have opened the pores of my being to breathe freely, and my stomach h as no greed to possess of others. Reality, truth, life, are all around us and in us. One cann ot escape life.

Sleep has many depths and d eath is but a \u0000 reparative becoming \u0000 , for we are of eternity in time. Therefore, be willing to pay in the giving and taking without argument, and for him who cheats there is ultimate repayment, for where the morality of exchange e nds, business would b egin.

Thus emana tes our great inferiority, the down - stepping to the point at which the predator m ust repay and incarnate as...? — as he deserves. Why is the subconsciousness always c ryptically symbolic and mainly manifests in sleep? As usual, there is more than one answer: 1) Why do the stars only show at night? And, \u0000 hold your hand in front of your face and you cann ot see the Sun \u0000 , i.e., our foreconsciousness is mainly from outside and therefore precludes inn er vision. 2) The subconsciousness discloses s lowly and latently, because by our limitations we can realize only so much at any \u0000 one time \u0000 . 3) Any full disclosure and the whole need and p urpose of existence would b e unn ecessary. And there are other reasons. What we observe from \u0000 outside \u0000 becomes memory, enters the subcon sciousness and merges with other and older impressions. So, one function of the subconsciousness is to unify these superimposed impressions using the language of parallel symbology and to represent them as simile, not as arbitrary configuration [words ille gible in original text].

Nothing in the subconscious is any more indecent than anything else. Whether our contacts are psy chic or physical they are real, and fear or hope of them determ ines our way.

Although we cann ot know instantly or entirely the c ontents and p rocesses of the subconsciousness, we can evo ke it, and b y that act in a measure control it as required, for it will again respond d irectly to o ur will. How so? Here is the workable supposition: Truth is not essential to belief, as it always c o ntains sufficient for us to make our truth, for if you believe a thing or idea is true, then it will become as truth for you. Therefore, if we deliberately attach belief to the meaning we give to a sign or symbol, then when we question that sign in our own way, via the subconsciousness, it will answer truthfully.

The qualities necessary a re mainly unknown, and any form ula for such is guess - work. We all have some degree of aptitude in some direction, and this is the best guide.

For m any y ears I made e very test I could apply to my experiments: \"What is unlivable is unbelievable; truth shall be within this limit\", was my springboard. Telepathy I left alone as having been sufficiently proved b y involuntary/spontaneous evidence and b y deliberate tests. My experiences at séances were abortive.

Contact would be as difficult as [with a person a]s leep. My first tests were with prediction; these at least dealt with the future, which precluded faking. My ventures into Astrology, Palmistry, etc., proved their capabilities — and their drawbacks.

I have gone to great lengths and could p rove much more than mediums, clairvoyants or clairaudients. In a long predeterm ined test with a friend (Desmond Coke) I described unknown people in psychical and other detail of such n ature as c oul d only be known to the persons concerned, in addition to future e vents relating to them. The e nquirer had no contact with me or the cards, an essential part of this test. Another test by a famous s urgeon who asked me to foretell by the cards what he was th inking at a given time: I was warned it would b e something unusual and d ifficult. In a few minutes I gave him the correct answer. Afterwards I showed him how the \u0000 oracle \u0000 worked, and he himself was able to perform a similar feat. He was s o impressed that h e bought my pack of cards at my own price. This has happened more than once. On another occasion, I carried out a successful series of tests with cards at R. H.

That any desire, sufficiently dynamic, compressed into a single wish or belief (as \u0000 question - request \u0000 ), if arabesquely form ulated, will fulfil its evolution exp ediently and return its c onative possibility.

Th e terrain between pure Ego (mediator) and ego empirical (conative) is the form ative, amalgamative and rationalizing domain which reveals by symbols and metaphor only, and which answers only by such presentation, i.e., a problem, a cryptograph and p icturesq ue arabesques.
