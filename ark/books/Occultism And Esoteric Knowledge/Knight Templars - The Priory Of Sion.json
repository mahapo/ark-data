[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Priory of Sion members Pierre Plantard Leonardo da Vinci Philippe, Marquis de Chérisey Isaac Newton According to the Dossiers secrets, the primary aim of the Priory of Sion is the protection and advancement of the descendants of the Merovingian dynasty, their ultimate objective being placing them on the throne of – or at least in positions of power and influence in - France. The President of the 1956 Priory of Sion was Andre Bonhomme. Andre Bonhomme was one of the four founding members of the Priory of Sion in Annemasse in 1956, along with Pierre Plantard. He is tired of being harassed by inquiries about the nature of the association and doesn't want any publicity - he refuses to be interviewed on tv or radio. He doesn't understand where people get the idea that the Priory was anything other than what it was - just a small club of friends. This was the statement he made to the BBC in 1996: \"The Priory of Sion doesn't exist anymore. We were never involved in any activities of a political nature. It was four friends who came together to have fun. We called ourselves the Priory of Sion because there was a mountain by the same name close-by. I haven't seen Pierre Plantard in over 20 years and I don't know what he's up to but he always had a great imagination. I don't know why people try to make such a big thing out of nothing.\" And to quote French Researcher Jean-Luc Chaumeil from his 1994 book ‘The Table Of Isis, Part 2, The Templars Of The Apocalypse: The Message Of A Sacred Enigma - Tales, Legends And Myths Of Rennes-le-Chateau’: \"Finally, the Priory of Sion was created in 1956. We were able to contact former members of this office, who all burst out laughing when we mentioned Rennes-le-Château. According to its former President, the association was at the time a \"club for boy scouts\" and NOTHING MORE....!\" And from the BBC 2 ‘Timewatch’ documentary The History of a Mystery (1996): \"There's no evidence for a Priory of Sion until the 1950s; to find it, you go to the little town of St-Julien. Under French Law every new club or association must register itself with the Authorities, and that's why there's a dossier here showing that a Priory of Sion filed the proper forms in 1956. According to a founding member, this eccentric association took its name not from Jerusalem, but from a nearby mountain (Col du Mont Sion Alt. 786 m). The dossier also notes that the Priory's self-styled Grand Master Pierre Plantard, who is central to this story, has done time in jail.\" There was a secret order behind the Knight's Templar, which created the Templars as its military and administrative arm. This order, which has functioned under a variety of names, is most frequently known as the Prieure de Sion ('Priory of Zion').\" Baigent, Leigh & Lincoln, The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail \"Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln uncovered evidence of a conspiracy surrounding the Order of Sion (sometimes referred to as the Order of Our Lady of Sion), which involved a number of families from Champagne. This, they claim, was behind the founding of the Templars. The prime mover in these events was Hugues, Count of Champagne, who was instrumental in founding the Order and who eventually joined the Templars himself in 1125. Some historians believe that Hugues was related to Hughes de Payens - the records are sketchy - but he certainly was his feudal lord.\" Lynn Pick nett & Clive Prince, Turin Shroud - In Whose Image? The Shock ing Truth Unveiled \"Certain writers have suggested that the Templars were 'infected' with the Johannite or Mandaean heresy - which denounced Jesus as a 'false prophet' and acknowledged John [the Baptist] as the true Messiah. In the course of their activities in the Middle East the Templars undoubtedly established contact with Johannite sects...\" Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln, The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail \"The Grand-Pontiffs of this sect [the Johannites] took the title of Christ, and laid claim to an unbroken chain of succession in their office. At the time of the foundation of the Order of the Temple (AD 1118), the Grand-Pontiff was named Theocletes; he was acquainted with Hugo de Payens and initiated him into the mysteries and privileges of his Church, promising him the sovereign priesthood and supreme government, finally designating him as his successor.\" Kenneth Mack enzie, The Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia At least two alleged Grand Masters of the Prieure de Sion showed an involvement in Johannite-related activities. The allegation that Hughes de Payens was secretly a Johannite was repeated in the nineteenth century, first by the Vatican and later by the Theosophists. \"The Johannites ascribed to Saint John [the Baptist] the foundation of their Secret Church, and the Grand Pontiffs of the Sect assumed the title of Christos, Anointed, or Consecrated, and claimed to have succeeded one another from Saint John by an uninterrupted succession of pontifical powers.

Freedom of intellectual thought and the restoration of one and universal religion was their secret object. Sworn to the vow of obedience, poverty, and chastity, they were at first the true Knights of John the Baptist, crying in the wilderness and living on wild honey and locusts. Such is the tradition and the true kabalistic version.\" M. P. Blavatsk y, Isis Unveiled henry.htmhenry.htmrc.htmrc.htm Mysteries of Rennes-le-Chateau and the Prieure du Sion by Steve Mizrach Here are the basic outlines of the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau. It was clear that Berenger Sauniere, the parish priest of the small village during the late 19th and early 20th century, had been receiving vast sums of money to refurbish the local church and also to build many structures in the area, such as his Tower of the Magdalene (Tour Magdala). Sauniere died in 1917, leaving the secret of where he got his fabulous wealth to his housekeeper, Marie Dernaud, who promised to reveal it on her deathbed -- but sadly she had a stroke which left her paralyzed and unable to speak before her death in 1953. Speculation was rife on the source of the parish priest's money. Was it the lost treasure of the Templars or the Cathars in the area? Might it have been buried Visigothic gold? Or was he blackmailing the Church with some terrible secret? The evidence that points to the last possibility is that Sauniere's confession before his death was so shocking that the priest who heard it denied him absolution and last rites. The mystery is rendered greater by a series of parchments found by the cleric in 1891, which contained an easily discovered (but extraordinarily difficult to translate) cipher. They were apparently written by his predecessor, Abbe Antoine Bigou, confessor to Marie d'Hautpoul, in 1781. (The same cipher appears on her tombstone.) The parchments were, on the face of it, Latin transcriptions of passages from the Gospels; but they contained deeper mysteries. Sauniere also appears to have left certain other \"clues\" in the highly unusual redesign of his church and of the other structures in the area. Hidden within those Latin parchments was a message in French: \"THIS TREASURE BELONGS TO DAGOBERT II KING AND TO SION AND HE IS THERE DEAD.\" Within the second parchment was an even stranger message: \"SHEPHERDESS NO TEMPTATION THAT POUSSIN TENIERS HOLD THE KEY PEACE 681 BY THE CROSS AND THIS HORSE OF GOD I COMPLETE (could also trans. as DESTROY) THIS DAEMON GUARDIAN AT MIDDAY BLUE APPLES.\" A third cipher that appears, not in the documents, but at Shugborough Hall's Shepherd Monument, is the curious \"D.O.U.O.S.V.A.V.V.M\" which has never been translated. There is a famous painting by Poussin entitled Les Bergers D'Arcadie (the Arcadian shepherds) which shows them around a tomb containing the mysterious inscription \"Et in Arcadia Ego...\" This tomb appears to be a virtual replica of one not too dissimilar to it right outside of Rennes-le-Chateau. Three intrepid historians searched far and away for others to help decipher the puzzle. Suffice to say, Lincoln, Baigent, and Leigh did a masterful job of \"unearthing\" the Merovingian monarch Dagobert and tied together many mysteries of history with a fantastic thesis that can be stated as thus: Jesus and Mary Magdalene, legitimate nobility from the Judaic Houses of Benjamin and David, married and sired heirs. Jesus did not die on the cross but went either to England or India. The Magdalene's heirs married into the Visigoth families of the time and gave birth to the sacred Merovingian ruling family. The Visigoths of the area might have themselves been descended from the House of Benjamin, which had fled to the Arcadia region of Greece, and thence north into France, a thousand years earlier. The Merovingians were not wiped out by the Carolingian usurpers, and their lineage survives in some of the other royal families of Europe; apparently the goal of the secret society entitled the Prieure du Sion is a Merovingian restoration in France. Apparently. For nothing is as it seems with the Rennes mystery. But in the hands of Leigh, Lincoln, and Baigent, it seems to encompass myriads of others -- the dissolution of the Templars, the downfall of the Cathars, the bizarre Rosicrucian manifestoes, and other political intrigues of French history. For it seems that Sion has a grievance against the Church, who betrayed the Merovingian"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"dynasty and crowned its destroyers. If Sauniere was an agent of Sion, it might explain why he was denied absolution. Village of Mystery Henri Boudet, the Abbe' of Rennes-les-Bains (which neighbors Rennes-le-Chateau) who wrote The True Celtic Language and the Cromlech at Rennes-les-bains, may have been the \"brains\" behind Sauniere. Lincoln thinks his book may offer the key to the mystery. Boudet appears to argue in the book the silly thesis that the Celts spoke Anglo-Saxon, and that it -- English, in effect -- was the language which was spoken by Noah's sons before the Tower of Babel. But David Wood and Henry Lincoln conclude that the book may be averring something else -- that perhaps there was a universal language before the Deluge: Number (or Measure). And that the \"key\" to the \"Cromlech\" of Rennes-les-Bains might be the old English mile. Lincoln believes that metrology may play an important part in the Rennes-le-Chateau mystery. In any case, other authors have noted that Boudet died under strange circumstances, and that his book may have been sought out and destroyed by the Bishop de Beausejour. Boudet, a linguistic scholar, would have been a logical choice for Sauniere to approach with his curious Latin parchments. There are a few grisly murders that have taken place in the area to add to the air of mystery. One was that of the old priest Jean-Antoine-Maurice Gelis. Toward the end of his life he became a paranoid hermit and recluse; the only person he would admit to his presbytery was his niece, to bring him food. Despite his absurd precautions, someone surprised him on All Saints' Eve in 1897, bashed him with some fire tongs, delivered four blows from an ax, and then reverently laid the corpse on the ground with the hands crossed over the chest. Whoever it was ransacked the room, but took no money. A team of researchers found three corpses in Sauniere's garden in 1956, all of them shot. Were they World War II victims? Or something else..? Noel Corbu, who took care of Marie Denarnaud after her paralyzing stroke, and who may have learned of something from her incoherent dying whispers, was killed in a horrendous car crash in 1953 that some suspect was not an accident. Sauniere's \"heart attack\" in 1917 came on the suspicious date of January 17th (St. Anthony's day) and there are hints that the coffin had been ordered in advance. A courier who carried the secret dossiers found by Sauniere, Fakhur el Islam, was found dead on train tracks just outside of Melun, East Germany, in 1967. There are many more tantalizing things about Rennes-le-Chateau. According to one researcher, it may be laid out in the shape of a \"Ship of the Dead\" with a helmeted warrior borne to sea. Yet another thinks that the Paris Meridian may have been drawn so that it quite deliberately passes, ley-fashion, straight through Rennes-le-Chateau, Arques, and Conques. Still others see links between the site and Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland or Shugborough Hall in Staffordshire, England. It is known that Sauniere took his parchments to the Abbe Bieil, of the seminary of St. Sulpice, which was where the Abbe's nephew Emile Hoffet launched the Catholic Modernist rebellion which would eventually land Modernist works on the Vatican's banned list. Saint Sulpice's feast day, January 17th, is the date of Sauniere's sudden stroke. He was the bishop of Bourges, on the Paris Meridian, and in his seminary is an obelisk with a copper line marking the exact point of the alignment. Codes, Ciphers, and Scripts Perhaps the most enigmatic elements mentioned in the text as decoded by Lionel Fanthorpe is the phrase \"Blue Apples at Noon.\" The code in the parchments is only decipherable through the use of the knight's tour -- a logic puzzle wherein one \"jumps\" a knight to every square on a chess board, once and only once. It is a puzzle which has only one solution -- as does the code, clearly. But the use of chessboard imagery at Rennes-le-Chateau is striking. Clearly, to some degree, the puzzle lies in the layout of the redesign of Sauniere's church, and his other building projects. The village parish church had been dedicated to the Magdalene in 1059; during the restoration, he found the mysterious parchment (supposedly) in a hollow Visigothic pillar underneath the altar stone. A statue of the demon Asmodeus guards near the door. The plaques depicting the Stations of the Cross contain bizarre inconsistencies. One shows a child swathed in Scottish plaid. Another has Pontius Pilate wearing a veil. St. Joseph and Mary are each depicted holding a Christ child, as if to allude to the old legend that Christ had a twin. Other statues are of rather esoteric saints in unusual postures: St. Roch displays his wounded thigh (like the Grail King Anfortas), St. Anthony the Hermit holds a closed book, St. Germaine releases a bevy of roses from her apron, and the Magdalene is shown holding a vase. Sauniere's library and study, the Tour Magdala, is placed precariously over a precipitous chasm at a place where one would be foolish to build such a permanent structure, unless... There are many writers connected with the Rennes mystery. It might be productive to reexamine their works with a new eye for such hidden codes. One, the novelist Victor Hugo, and another, the playwright, Jean Cocteau, are said to have presided over the Prieure. But other writers appear to be strongly connected to the mystery. Three in particular are the so-called \"Inklings\": fantasy writer J.R.R. Tolkien, \"Screwtape\" writer C.S. Lewis, and Charles Williams. Lionel Fanthorpe also suspects that Isaac Asimov, Jules Verne, George McDonald, and Umberto Eco may somehow have provided clues to the mystery in their books. Sir Walter Raleigh, who is now thought to have been involved in an esoteric body known as the \"School of Night\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"(whose motto was that \"inspiration comes to the philosopher at night, when nature and the rest of humanity sleeps\"), may have also been part of the Order of Sion. The theme of \"Arcadia\" was prominent in Elizabethan literature, and it appears in the works of writers such as Edmund Spenser, Sir Phillip Sidney, and even Shakespeare, for whom the word was synonymous with the Golden Age. Through the historical detective work of Frances Yates, we now know that this era was a time when many \"Rosicrucian\" ideas were moving to the Continent, and esoteric thinkers were confluencing around Frederick, Elector of the Palatinate of Bohemia, as the figure who would usher in the reforms of Church and State many expected. The Once and Future King Perhaps the Merovingians' most unusual chronicler is Gerard de Sede, who claims the \"Fabulous Race\" descends from extraterrestrials from Sirius (!), and who points out that at their stronghold in Stenay (also known as Satanicum), frogs frequently fall from the sky. Up until recently, little was known about these long-haired kings, as they inhabited that historical epoch derided as the \"Dark Ages.\" The founder of the royal line, Merovech, was said to be of two fathers -- his mother, already pregnant by King Chlodio, was seduced while swimming in the ocean by a Quinotaur, whatever that was, and Merovech was formed somehow by the commingling of Frankish blood and that of the mysterious aquatic creature. Like the Nazoreans of old, the Merovingian monarchs never cut their hair and bore a distinctive birthmark -- said to be a red cross over the shoulder blades. Their robes were fringed with tassels which were said to carry magical curative powers. They were known as occult adepts, and in one Merovingian tomb was found such items as a golden bull's head, a crystal ball, and several golden miniature bees. Strangely, many skulls of these monarchs appear to have been ritually incised; i.e., trepanned. The Sicambrians, ancestors of the Franks, were known as the \"people of the Bear\" for their worship of the bear-goddess Arduina. The word Arcadia comes from Arkas, patron god of that area of Greece, the son of the nymph Callisto, sister of the huntress Artemis. Callisto's constellation is also known to many as Ursa Major, the Great Bear. The name \"Arthur\" comes from the Celtic arth, related to \"Ursus\" -- namely, \"bear.\" In legend, the Merovingians were said to be descended from the Trojans, and Homer reports that Troy was founded by a colony of Arcadians. The Prieure documents claim that the Arcadians were descended from Benjamites driven out of Palestine by their fellow Israelites for idolatry. \"Arcadia\" was also known as the source of the River Alphaeus, the \"underground stream\" which figures so prominently in Coleridge's poetry and in esoteric literature. The Merovingians were \"sacred kings\" who reigned but did not rule, leaving the secular governing function to chancellors known as the Mayors of the Palace. It was one of these Mayors, Pepin the Fat, who founded the dynasty that came to supplant them -- the Carolingians. One of the great Merovingian kings, Clovis, struck a deal with the newly nascent Roman church. He would subdue their enemies, the Arian Visigoths and the pagan Lombards, in return for baptism into the faith and recognition of his right to rule a new Roman empire as \"Novus Constantinus.\" Yet one of his descendants, Dagobert II, was murdered by a lance pierced through his eye (or poison poured in the ear -- accounts vary) at the orders of Pepin. The church endorsed the assassination, flatly betrayed its pact with Clovis, and in turn recognized the family of usurpers as legitimate, culminating with the crowning of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor. It was thought that the Merovingian lineage was extinguished; in any case it was excised from the history books. But there is some evidence that Dagobert's son, Siegebert IV, survived and that a Merovingian principality continued to be ruled in Septimania by Guillem de Gellone, a descendant -- and ancestor -- of Godfroi de Bouillon. If the Prieure documents are to be believed, the Merovingian lineage persists to this day, largely due to efforts to preserve it through intermarriage. The significance of such alliances is the key. Dagobert married the daughter of the Visigothic Count of Razes, giving his descendants hereditary title to the lands surrounding Rennes-le-Chateau. The Arch-Cabal The Prieure du Notre Dame du Sion, or Priory of Zion, is said to be the cabal behind many of the events that occurred at Rennes-le-Chateau. According to the Prieure's own documents, its history is long and convoluted. Its earliest roots are in some sort of Hermetic or Gnostic society led by a man named Ormus. This individual is said to have reconciled paganism and Christianity. The story of Sion only comes into focus in the Middle Ages. In 1070, a group of monks from Calabria, Italy, led by one Prince Ursus, founded the Abbey of Orval in France near Stenay, in the Ardennes. These monks are said to have formed the basis for the Order de Sion, into which they were \"folded\" in 1099 by Godfroi de Bouillion. For about one hundred years, the Order of the Temple (Knights Templar) and Sion were apparently unified under one leadership, though they are said to have separated at the \"cutting of the elm\" at Gisors in 1188. (The Templar order was then destroyed by King Phillipe Le Bel of France, in 1307.) Sion appears to have been at the nexus of two French antimonarchical movements, the Compagnie du St.-Sacrament of the 17th century (acting on behalf on the Guise-Lorraine families) and the Fronde of the 18th, as well as behind an attempt to make the Hapsburgs emperors of all Europe in the 19th -- the Hieron du Val d'Or. It appears that there are vast connections between Sion and numerous sociocultural strata in European thought -- Roscicrucianism, Freemasonry, Arthurian and Grail legends, \"Arcadianism,\" Catharism, chivalry, etc. Yet this mysterious secret society brought itself to light in 1956 and is listed with the French directory of organizations under the subtitle \"Chivalry of Catholic Rules and Institutions of the Independent and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Traditionalist Union,\" which in French abbreviates to CIRCUIT -- the name of the magazine distributed internally among members. Depending on what statutes one considers, Sion either has 9,841 members in nine grades, or 1,093 members in seven, with the supreme member, the \"Nautonnier\" or Grand Master of the Order being, till 1963, Jean Cocteau. While it is believed the head has been Pierre Plantard de St.-Clair up until recent times, he claims to have left that post in 1984, so it is not clear who runs the organization at this time. But whoever he is, he has had illustrious predecessors: Jacques DeMolay, Leonardo de Vinci, Isaac Newton, and Claude Debussy, among others! Plantard, in any case, seems to have enjoyed the ear of many influential persons in contemporary French politics -- deGaulle, Marcel Lefebvre, Francois Ducaud-Bourget, Andre Malraux, and Alain Poher, and others, many of whom appear to know him from his efforts with the Resistance during the Vichy occupation. Despite its registry, however, the organization remains untraceable, its given address and number leading to dead ends -- which might lead one to wonder why the government never bothered to verify the information. Some interesting things have come to light about the Prieure recently. One is that the Swiss Grand Lodge Alpina (GLA), the highest body of Swiss Freemasonry (akin to the Grand Lodge of England), may have been the recruiting body for the Prieure. But the GLA is also said by some to be the meeting place of the \"Gnomes of Zurich\" (The name comes from former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson.) who are said to be the Power Elite of Swiss bankers and international financiers. The \"Gnomes\" are supposed to be like the exclusive members of \"Bohemian Grove\" in California -- a group of richer-than-rich paparazzi who gather each year to burn \"effigies of care,\" presumably representing concern for the poor. The GLA is also said by David Yallop to be the body which controlled the P2 Masonic Lodge in Italy. (P2 controlled the Italian secret police in the 1970s, took money from the CIA and KGB, may have had a hand in the kidnapping of Aldo Moro by the Red Brigades, had 900 agents in other branches of the Italian government and the highest positions of the Vatican, bombed a train station and tried to blame it on the Communists, used the Vatican Bank to launder Mafia drug money, fomented fascist coups in South America, and is most likely linked to the arch-conservative Knights of Malta and Opus Dei in the Vatican.) P2's Licio Gelli may have had a role in the death of John Paul I, and perhaps even the assassination attempt on John Paul II. One of the most interesting people to write about the Prieure may be Michael Lamy. He claims that Jules Verne was a member of both the Prieure and the Illuminati. Further, he maintains that the Prieure's politics must be understood as \"Orleanist,\" which he describes as \"aristocratic, anarchistic, and Nietzchean.\" Perhaps it all becomes most clear when Lamy reveals to the reader that the true secret of the village of Rennes-le-Chateau is that the extinct volcano Mount Bugarach leads down into the hollow earth to a realm of supermen. Ean Begg feels it is connected with many of the Black Virgin sites all over Europe. Certainly, if the organization's full name is the Prieure de Notre Dame du Sion, and if it is site of Orval is connected to the worship of the bear-goddess Arduina, venerated by the Sicambrian Franks of the area and their Merovingian kings, then this may be the case. There are hints, of course, that \"Notre Dame\" is not the mother of Jesus, but Mary of Bethany AKA Magdalene, a princess of the tribe of Benjamin, which is itself notorious for an outbreak of goddess-idolatry in the period of the Judges. That Mary may also be the one also known to the Gypsies of the south of France as one of the three \"Maries-de-la-Mer,\" whom they call \"Sarah the Egyptian,\" the sun-burnt one. Sailing and Grailing Across the Atlantic The most bizarre chapter in the story of Rennes-le-Chateau may have to do with the Money Pit mystery on Oak Island just off Nova Scotia. According to Michael Bradley, some of the keepers of the Grail may have come to the New World long before Columbus. (Key proof: acorns do not float, he notes.) He believes that some of the Templars may have fled to Canada after the dissolution of their order, carrying the Grail. (The Money Pit has more often been associated with pirates' buried treasure, but as many know, the \"Jolly Roger\" flag's skull-and-crossbones icon has long been associated with Masonic and Templar legend.) The so-called Venetian Zeno Map of the 15th century shows a knight with a sword standing where Nova Scotia is. (The Sinclairs of Scotland are \"hereditary lords of Rosslyn Chapel\" and are said to be descended from the Scots Guards, a clique loyal to the Stuart dynasty, which in turn are thought to have contained converted members of the Templar Order who fought with Robert the Bruce at Bannockburn, and to have provided the basis of Freemasonry.) In the Money Pit on Oak Island, a mysterious stone inscription was found: \"FORTY FEET BELOW TWO MILLION POUNDS ARE BURIED.\" Every company that has tried to locate this treasure has failed. One author has even recently speculated that the site was the burial place of an Arif, or Coptic Christian holy man from the 5th century. Along with the supposed visits of Prince Madoc of Wales and St. Brendan of Ireland, Prince Henry the Navigator's trip to the New World with the Zeno brothers makes it one of numerous European pre-Columbian voyages. The Zeno map, along with those culled by Viking travelers, may have even helped Columbus make his way across the Atlantic. (More than one writer has pointed to Columbus' possible Judaic heritage, and the ways in which \"messianism\" pervades his thoughts on the discovery.) Recently, a UFO \"contactee\" in Canada who calls himself only \"Guardian\" speculated wildly about some \"Brotherhood of the Grail\" being operative there for centuries. Geographically speaking, there are in fact two Oak Islands, surrounding a central river, at the confluence of which is a mysterious ruin, which appears to be a fortress or old castle. It does appear that there may be strands connecting Rennes-le-Chateau and the New World. Ultimately, the Rosicrucian ideas behind the American experiment (as documented by Manly Palmer Hall)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"may have deeper \"Arcadian\" roots. Bradley hints, but does not come out and say, that what is beneath the Money Pit may be the Grail. It is not the only weird trail in the Rennes mystery. One researcher insists that the inventor Barnes Wallis was one of the most recent Grand Masters of Sion. Yet another feels it is worth pursuing the origins of the Cajun people of Louisiana. Another current theory is that Johann Salvator, the young Hapsburg prince, finding his political ambitions rebuffed, may have sailed west and discovered the mysterious underground tunnels and lost cities of South America which so fascinated Col. Perry Fawcett. Others have even found connections to the so-called \"Baconian\" theory, which suggests that Sir Francis Bacon authored Shakespeare's plays. Bacon's works suggest a Rosicrucian experiment taking place in the New World. Fanthorpe seems to believe that ultimately Rennes-le-Chateau may be a \"doorway unto the invisible\" -- a gateway to other dimensions, through the Emerald Tablet, which he speculates may have been a tesseract (3-dimensional representation of a 4-dimensional figure.) -- or a place to contact Gaia itself. The Visigothic kingdom of Rhedae was in the area, and the Visigoths are known to have seized at least some portion of the treasure of the Temple (taken by the Romans during the Jewish Revolt of 70 CE) when they sacked Rome in the 5th century CE. Could that treasure have been the Ark of the Covenant, concealed at Rennes? Alternatively, the Copper Scroll of the Dead Sea sect (the Qumran Essenes) suggested some of the Temple treasure was hidden before the Roman invasion. Could the \"Nestorian\" Christians of the area have concealed the Ark, and given it to the Templars for safekeeping? Or could it have been hidden in Solomon's Stables underneath the Mosque of Omar, where the Templars are known to have excavated? Might the Ark have been the item \"smuggled\" out by two Cathars under highly dangerous circumstances right before their brethren fell at Montsegur? The Ark may not have been an extraterrestrial \"power source,\" as some authors have claimed, but if it is the possession of Sion, it is an explosive secret, to say the least. Sion has claimed that they have items \"which will be returned to the government of Israel, when the time is right.\" Is the Grail in fact the Ark under a new guise? THE ROSICRUCIAN CONNECTION The Merovingians ~ Bloodline of Jesus or Synagogue of Satan? During the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church was a political power allied with the monarchies of Europe. In 1099 A.D., Pope Urben II called Western Christendom to take up arms to liberate the Holy Land from the Moslems. Later, in 1215, the Inquisition formally began during the reign of Pope Innocent III, who issued the following statement: \"That they shall be seized for trial and penalties, who engage in the translation of the sacred volumes, or who hold secret conventicles, or who assume the office of preaching without the authority of their superiors; against whom process shall be commenced, without any permission of appeal.\" Thomas M'Crie records, \"In the eleventh century, capital punishment, even in its most dreadful form, that of burning alive, was extended to all who obstinately adhered to opinions differing from the received faith.\" Henry Charles Lea wrote: \"The papal Inquisition . . . constituted a chain of tribunals throughout Continental Europe perpetually manned by those who had no other work to attend to...by constant interchange of documents and mutual co-operation they covered Christendom with a network rendering escape almost hopeless.\" (1) Today, the Vatican maintains its own State Department and an influential albeit non-voting presence in the United Nations. Reports such as the following confirm current Vatican negotiations to regain control of the Holy Land. Although it must now work through diplomatic channels, the second Vatican conquest of the Holy Land will be heralded as another spiritual mandate to reestablish the Holy Roman Empire. \"The Vatican's Jerusalem Agenda\" by Israeli journalist, Barry Chamish, inquired: \"Did Shimon Peres make a deal with the Vatican?\" Consider the evidence: "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"* On Sept. 10, '93, just three days before the signing of the Declaration of Principles in Washington, the Italian news magazine La Stampa reported that part of the peace deal was an unwritten understanding that the Vatican would receive political auth ority over the Old City of Jerusalem by the end of the millenium. The newspaper reported that Shimon Peres had promised the pope to hand over the holy sites of Jerusalem the previous May and that Arafat had accepted the agreement. * In March '94, the Israeli newsmagazine Shishi published an interview with Mark Halter, a French intellectual and close friend of Shimon Peres. He said he delivered a letter from Peres to the Pope the previous May, within which Peres offered the Vatic an hegemony over the Old City of Jerusalem. The article detailed Peres's offer which essentially turned Jerusalem into an international city overseen by the Holy See. * In March '95, the radio station Arutz Sheva announced that it had seen a cable sent by the Israeli Embassy in Rome to the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem outlining the handover of the Old City of Jerusalem to the Vatican. Two days later Haaretz publish ed the cable on its front page. The Foreign Ministry explained that the cable was genuine but someone had whited out the word \"not.\" ie We will not transfer authority to the Vatican. Incredibly, numerous Bnei Brak rabbis who had cancelled Passover meetings with Peres over the issue o f the cable accepted the explanation and reinvited him to their homes. The Foreign Ministry's Legal Affairs Spokesperson, Esther Samilag, publicly complained about \"various capitulations\" to the Vatican. She was immediately transferred to a post at the Israeli Embassy in Katmandu, Nepal. MK Avraham Shapira announced in the Knesset that he had information that all Vatican property in Jerusalem was to become tax exempt and that large tracts of real estate on Mount Zion were given to the pope in perpetuity. Jerusalem's late Deputy Mayor Shmuel Meir announced that he had received \"information that properties promised to the Vatican would be granted extra-territorial status.\" Beilin was forced to answer the accusations. He admitted, 'Included in the Vatican Agreement is the issue of papal properties in Israel that will be resolved by a committee of experts that has already been formed.' If so, this committee has not since r eleased any proof of its existence. With all this in mind, how do we interpret the Vatican's current position on Jerusalem? The following report, circulated by MSANews may shed some light on that: Vatican City, Jun 14, 1997 (VIS) - Archbishop Renato Martino, apostolic nuncio and Holy See permanent observer to the United Nations, spoke June 9 on the status of Jerusalem at the New York headquarters of the Path to Peace Foundation. The archbishop a ddressed members of this foundation as well as U.S. members of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem. He began by briefly summarizing the \"well-known and long-standing position of the Holy See with regard to Jerusalem. He stated that Jerusalem \"for us, of course, along with the rest of the Holy Land, is that special link between heaven and earth, that place where God walked and ultimately died among men. And of course we recognize that others revere Jerusalem as the city of David a nd the prophets and the city known to Mohammed .... It is a spiritual treasure for all of humanity, and it is a city of two peoples, Arabs and Jews, and of the three monotheistic religions, Christianity, Judaism and Islam.\" Archbishop Martino added that \"in recent years it has been increasingly difficult to break through the political and media-imposed stranglehold on the question of Jerusalem.\" he recounted Jerusalem's recent history, recalling in particular the UN's Gen eral Assembly Resolution 181 of 1947 calling for Jerusalem to be considered a 'corpus separatum' under the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations,\" a resolution which Israel accepted. He pointed out that, in addressing the gridlock which has resulte d from the 1967 Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem, \"the Holy See has therefore advocated the granting to Jerusalem of an 'internationally guaranteed special statute. That is the phrase used by Pope John Paul II in his 1984 Apostolic Letter 'Redempti on is Anno'.\" This statute \"asks that regardless of how the problem of sovereignty is resolved and who is called to exercise it, there should be a supra-national and international entity endowed with means adequate to insure the preservation of the special character istics of the City, its Holy Places, the freedom to visit them, its religious and ethnic communities, a guarantee of their essential liberties, and its city plan'.\" The apostolic nuncio recalled the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Israel in 1993, when both signed the 'Fundamental Agreement.\" He noted Article 4 of this agreement where \"both the Holy See and Israel affirm their continu ing commitment to the 'Status quo' in the Christian Holy Places.\" He also spoke of the problems sparked by Israel's recent authorization of \"a project for the construction of settlements in occupied territory in East Jerusalem\" for which \"there was wide-spread international condemnation.\" This issue, he reminded thos e present, was brought before the UN Security Council on March 7 and March 21 of this year, but without resolution \"because the sole country on the Security Council which opposed the Resolution was the United States.\" An Emergency Session of the General Assembly, \"organized only nine other times in the history of the United Nations\" was held on April 24-25. The Holy See delegation was contacted and asked for suggestions for a Resolution, Archbishop Martino said. And he recounted the meetings, rough drafts of proposals and negotiations which followed. The approved texts of the eventual Resolution, he underlined, contained \"those points championed by the Holy See .... The General Assembly has here called for 'internationally guaranteed provisions' - the equivalent of the 'internationally guaranteed s pecial status' called for by Pope John Paul II. This is particularly noteworthy because in this case, the Arab delegations all voted for this Resolution and therefore for this provision.\" \"The Holy Places within Jerusalem,\" concluded Archbishop Martino, \"are not merely museum relics to be opened and closed by the dominant political authority, no matter who that might be at any given moment. They are living shrines precious to the hearts and faith of believers.\" DELSS/STATUS JERUSALEM/UN:MARTINO VIS 970616 (640) Could that supra-national entity which will oversee the international city of Jerusalem be the Vatican just as Peres promised? And how do we react to Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert's recent announcement that he will begin negotiations with the Vatican, bu t \"only over holy sites?\" (2)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE VATICAN vs. THE PRIEUR É DE SION Concurrent with the Vatican's negotiations for authority over the Old City of Jerusalem, others who would also establish a claim to the throne of David have a covetous eye on the Holy Land. The Prieuré de Sion appears to be the hierarchy of a vast network of organizations which make up a Secret Brotherhood that covers the globe. \"There are a great many secret societies in operation, [Charles] Nodier declares. But there is one, he adds, that takes precedence over all others, that in fact presides over all others. According to Nodier this 'supreme' secret society is called the Philadelphes. At the same time, however, he speaks of 'the oath which forbids me to make them known under their social name. Nevertheless there is a hint of [the Prieuré de] Sion...\" - 31:152 According to Rosicrucian book Holy Blood, Holy Grail , this august body has maintained a low profile from its inception and remains behind the scenes orchestrating critical events in Western history. \"The Prieuré de Sion exists today and is still operative. It is influential and plays a role in high-level international affairs as well as in the domestic affairs of certain European countries...\" (3) The Prieuré also claims to be the Guardians of the Holy Grail--the sacred icon of the Merovingian bloodline which blasphemously purports to be the blood descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. According to another popular Grail book, Bloodline of the Holy Grail by Laurence Gardner, the Merovingian dynasty derives its name from the 5th century King Merovee of France, a descendant of the mystical Fisher-Kings, who was reportedly sired by: \"...the mysterious sea beast -- the Bistea Neptunis -- as symbolically defined in the Merovingian ancestry. The relevant sea-lord was King Pallas, a god of old Arcadia...The immortal sea-lord was said to be 'ever-incarnate in a dynasty of ancient kings' whose symbol was a fish - as was the traditional symbol of Jesus. (4) And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. Rev. 13:1 The dynasty of Merovingian kings reigned over Europe from the 5th to the 8th centuries, but was removed from power in 751 A.D. by a document called the Donation of Constantine, created for the express purpose of overthrowing this heretical dynasty of pagan kings. According to Sir Laurence Gardner's Realm of the Ring Lords , however, the document was a fraud: \". . . [I]t is important to consider the original document which made church kingship possible in the first place . . . because the implementation of this particular document some 1,248 years ago led to just about every social injustice that has been experienced in the Christian world. The document to which I refer is called 'The Donation of Constantine.' All monarchical and governmental practice has, for centuries, been based on the initial precept of this charter, but...the precept is invalid. There are those in our midst today who, under the dynasty rule of Grail entitlement, are rightful kings and queens. When the Donation made its first appearance in the middle 8th century, it was alleged to have been written by Emperor Constantine 400 years earlier (although, strangely, never produced in the interim). It was even dated and carried his supposed signature. What the document proclaimed was that the Pope was Christ's elected representative on Earth, with the power to 'create' kings as his subordinates. The provisions were put into operation by the Vatican in 751 whereupon the longstanding Merovingians were deposed and a whole new dynasty was supplemented by way of a family who had hitherto been mayors of the Royal Palace (the equivalent of prime ministers). They were dubbed 'Carolingians', and their only king of any consequence...was the legendary Charlemagne.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"During the Middle Ages, the Prieuré de Sion determined to reestablish the Merovingian bloodline as the royalty of Europe. \"The avowed and declared objective of the Prieuré de Sion is the restoration of the Merovingian dynasty and bloodline - not only to the throne of France, but to the thrones of other European nations as well.\" (3) In 1095, the Prieuré de Sion, having infiltrated and secured the patronage of the Roman Catholic Church, created the Order of the Knights of the Temple. Pope Urben II commissioned the Knights Templar to conduct the First Crusade, ostensibly to protect pilgrims to the Holy Land. \"During this crusading era, various knightly Orders merged, including the Ordre de Sion (Order of Sion) founded by Godefroi de Bouillon in 1099... \"From 1188, the Order of Sion had been restructured, and evolved to pursue a more specific course of loyalty to the Merovingian lineage of France... In practice, the two operated in close association because they were essentially concerned with the same root bloodline\" - 29:256,323 In actuality, the Merovingians intended to occupy the Holy Land and the Temple of Jerusalem in order to reestablish their dynasty as royal heirs of the Messianic lineage. It seems that the Roman authorities did not recognize the Messianic claim of the Merovingian lords but viewed the cult with a morbid suspicion of ulterior motives: \"During the latter years of the declining Empire, the greatest of all threats to the Roman Church arose from a Desposynic royal strain in Gaul. They were the Merovingian dynasty...\" (5) There is a pronounced anti-Catholic bias in all Merovingian literature which presages the outcome of this campaign for the seat of authority in Jerusalem. Revelation 17 does indicate that, for a brief period, there will be a global merger of Church and State to establish a world government. During this unholy alliance, the Great Harlot, the Roman Catholic Church, will ride the Beast \"drunken with the blood of the saints and with the martyrs of Jesus.\" However, after she \"hath glorified herself, and lived wantonly,\" then suddenly -- \"...the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.\" The authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail give a further clue as to why the Prieuré de Sion would ally with the Vatican and later break faith. In 1314, Pope Clement V and King Philippe IV of France martyred the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar -- Jacques de Molay. \"As the smoke from the slow fire choked the life from his body, Jacques de Molay is said to have issued an imprecation from the flames. According to tradition he called his persecutors -- Pope Clement and King Philippe -- to join him and account for themselves before the court of God within the year. Within a month Pope Clement was dead... \"By the end of the year Philippe was dead as well. There is, of course, no need to look for supernatural explanations. The Templars possessed great expertise in the use of poisons and there were certainly enough people about...to exact the appropriate vengeance. Nevertheless, the apparent fulfillment of the grand master's curse lent credence to belief in the orders occult powers. Nor did the curse end there...\" (6) Authors Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln propose that the French Revolution was perpetrated by the successors of the Knights Templar -- the French Freemasons -- to exact vengeance for the death of their Grand Master. The insinuation is plain that the final and \"appropriate vengeance\" toward the Vatican will be forthcoming when the Merovingian dynasty asserts its authority over its world kingdom. They propose that, in place of the Vatican papacy, a royal heir of Merovingian descent, \"The King of the Jews will be the real Pope\" and \"patriarch of an international church.\" The Prieuré de Sion's objectives include: "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"...a theocratic United States of Europe - a trans- or pan-European confederation assembled into a modern empire and ruled by a dynasty descended from Jesus. This dynasty would not only occupy a throne of political or secular power, but quite conceivably the throne of Saint Peter as well. Under that supreme authority there might then be an interlocking network of kingdoms or principalities, connected by dynastic alliances and intermarriage -- a kind of twentieth century feudal system, but without the abuses usually associated with that term. And the actual process of governing would presumably reside with the Prieuré de Sion -- which might take the form of, say, a European Parliament endowed with executive and/or legislative privileges... \"In a very real sense the time is right for the Prieuré to show its hand. The political systems and ideologies that in the early years of our century seemed to promise so much have virtually all displayed a degree of bankruptcy. Communism, socialism, fascism, capitalism, Western-style democracy have all, in one way or another, betrayed their promise, jaundiced their adherents, and failed to fulfill the dreams they engendered... There is a longing for a renewed sense of the sacred that amounts, in effect, to a full-scale religious revival -- exemplified by the proliferation of sects and cults, for example, and the swelling tide of fundamentalism in the United States. There is also a desire for a true 'leader' -- not a führer, but a species of wise and benign spiritual figure, a 'priest-king' in whom mankind can safely repose its trust... There are many devout Christians who do not hesitate to interpret the Apocalypse as nuclear holocaust. How might the advent of Jesus' lineal descendant be interpreted? To a receptive audience, it might be a kind of Second Coming.\" (7) According to the authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail , \". . .the text of the Protocols [of the Elders of Sion] ends with a single statement, 'Signed by the representatives of Sion of the 33rd Degree'.\" 31:193 These infamous Protocols, they claim, have been slanderously misrepresented and are, instead of an evil conspiracy, a humanitarian proposal authored by the elite Prieuré de Sion. In other words, the proposed new world order of the Prieuré will be a benevolent \"Masonic kingdom\" led by a new king of \"the holy seed of David.\" The Grand Master of the Prieuré de Sion at any given point in history, is considered to be the Grail King and the Messiah. A REVIVED MEROVINGIAN EMPIRE Who will be the heir-apparent of the purported royal bloodline of Jesus deemed worthy to sit on the throne of the kingdoms of this world? Holy Blood, Holy Grail provides the names of several noble families of Merovingian heritage, which include the following: \"We cannot point to one man and assert that he is Jesus' lineal descendant. There are at least a dozen families in Britain and Europe today -- with numerous collateral branches - who are of Merovingian lineage. These include the houses of Hapsburg-Lorraine (present titular dukes of Lorraine and kings of Jerusalem), Plantard, Luxembourg, Montpezat, Montesquiou, and various others. According to the 'Prieuré documents,' the Sinclair family in Britain is also allied to the bloodline, as are various branches of the Stuarts...\" (8) It is noteworthy that the late Princess Diana was a member of the Stuart bloodline, fifth removed from Charles II (9) and the Stuarts claim a greater nobility than the reigning House of Windsor, a bloodline that is not mentioned in the Merovingian list of worthies. Moreover, the contribution of the Stuart family is duly acclaimed, along with the glories of Freemasonry: \"During their stay in France the Stuarts had been deeply involved in the dissemination of Freemasonry. Indeed, they are generally regarded as the source of the particular form of Freemasonry known as Scottish Rite. Scottish Rite Freemasonry introduced higher degrees than those offered by other Masonic systems at the time. It promised initiation into greater and more profound mysteries -- mysteries supposedly preserved and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"handed down in Scotland. It established more direct connections between Freemasonry and the various activities -- alchemy, Cabalism, and Hermetic thought, for instance -- that were regarded as Rosicrucian...\" (10) In Bloodline of the Holy Grail , Sir Laurence Gardner attempts to prove that the House of Stuart still retains the legitimate right to the throne of England, possessing a living descendant of Bonnie Prince Charlie, whom the Jacobites sought to restore to the British Throne in 1727. The Jacobite Heritage , however, maintained that Gardner's genealogies are undocumented and cannot be supported by historical evidence. {This article has been removed.} It happens that the foreword to Bloodline of the Holy Grail is written by a Prince Michael Stewart of Albany, who is the Head of the Royal House of Stewart, which surname Sir Laurence maintains is \"Stuart,\" albeit with a different spelling. The Official Home Page of the Royal House of Stewart provides extensive information about the aspiring Prince, who also holds the position of Head of the European Council of Princes. The Jacobite Heritage refutes Prince Michael's claim to fame: \"Prince Michael\" claims to be \"President of the European Council of Princes (Le Conseil Europeen des Princes) - Un Organe Consultatif Constitutionel\". He says that this organisation was founded in 1946 (as the International Council of Government) with Archduke Otto of Austria as its President until 1992 (when \"Prince Michael\" succeeded). He also says that the heads of all the major European royal houses belong with the exception of the House of Windsor. [ The existence of this body before 1990 cannot be verified. Archduke Otto of Austria has never been president of any such body, nor has the head of any major European royal house ever been a member. The only people who might be members are people who claim legitimate descent from long extinct houses such as Hohenstaufen (ie. charlatans). \"Prince Michael\" claims to have connections with many European royal houses; he is, however, never seen at any of their celebrations marking baptisms, marriages, birthdays, or funerals. ] Prince Michael is thoroughly debunked as merely another pretender to the British throne on the Fantasy Royalty web site: \"The Royal House of Stuart became extinct in the male line with the death of Henry (IX) Stuart, Duke of York, Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church and Bishop of Frascati, in 1807. He had succeeded his elder brother, Charles (III) Stuart, sometimes known as 'Bonnie Prince Charlie,' in 1788, on the latter's death without legitimate issue (he left one illegitimate daughter, Clementina, who also died without issue). Both were the sons of James (III), Prince of Wales, only son of James II, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, (illegally) deposed as King of England and Scotland on 10 Dec 1688, and as King of Ireland six months later, who died in exile in 1701.\" Compounding the royal intrigue was the \"coincidental\" release (one week after Princess Diana's death) of an expose of the Royal Family which holds present title to the British throne, the House of Windsor. The Royals by Kitty Kelley brazenly asserts that Queen Elizabeth II was conceived by artificial insemination and that the Queen Mum is illegitimate. A Washington Post review of this popular book stated: \"Among the more startling claims is that both Queen Elizabeth and her sister, Princess Margaret, were conceived via 'manual fertilization' after their sickly father, George VI, failed to impregnate their mother, now the Queen Mum, in the more usual fashion. ... Though the sisters were born in 1926 and 1930, respectively, decades before artificial insemination became a widely used medical procedure, several prominent U.S. medical specialists contacted by The Post say the story's not implausible. 'It might have been quite possible,' says J. Benjamin Younger MD, executive director of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 'But is it true?'\" (11) Although this sensational revelation is most likely not true, such may be the requisite"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"propaganda which will dethrone the already disgraced House of Windsor. Dare we call it conspiracy? We know that Diana was required to give up her crown when she divorced Charles. In his recent release, The Forgotten Monarchy of Scotland , Prince Michael claims to be the \"legal Pretender to the throne of England\" (12), by which we infer is meant that he would receive it by default of Prince Charles. Should Prince Charles not accede to the throne (and there have been rumors that he would decline because of so many scandals), then Princes William and Henry may lose the right of succession, Diana having also relinquished her crown. Prince Michael makes the point that England does not have a constitution and therefore its monarchy is little more than a despotic feudal system. (13) He emphasizes, however, that Scotland has a constitution, in fact, it is the very Freemasonic model used by the Founding Fathers of the United States! However, George Washington knew the importance of a monarchy with a hereditary bloodline and even offered the American crown to Charles III Stuart. Although The Forgotten Monarchy of Scotland does not document these claims concerning the founding of the American system of government, the implication is clear that the ideal form of world government would be a constitutional monarchy under a restored Stuart monarchy. Led by whom? Probably not the dispossessed sons of Charles should he abdicate the British throne. And given the sudden promotion in Christian media of Prince Charles as the Antichrist, this eventuality seems a formidable prospect. Another development in the unfolding drama is a recent report that Israel is pursuing membership in the British Commonwealth. \"Israel is actively considering joining the British Commonwealth, following an 'unofficial approach' to its ambassador in London from the secretary-general of the 53-member organization. \"The approach was made earlier this month in a meeting between Ambassador Moshe Raviv and the Commonwealth’s secretary-general, Chief Emeka Anyaoku. The move is being seen as especially significant at a time when Israeli ties with the European Union and other international bodies have been strained over the stalled Middle East peace process. A spokesman for the Commonwealth confirmed that a meeting had taken place between Chief Anyaoku and Mr Raviv, but declined to provide further details. \"The approach came in the wake of a visit to London earlier this month by Yasser Arafat, during which the Palestinian Authority chief asked Commonwealth officials whether a future Palestinian state could have associate membership of the organization. (14) What human agency may be orchestrating the rise and fall of the kingdoms of this world and leading them to fulfill Zechariah's prophesy that Israel will become a burdensome stone for all people? (12:3) Holy Blood, Holy Grail and Bloodline of the Holy Grail are obviously publications of the Prieuré of Sion, the founders of the Knights Templar who preceded the Rosicrucians and Freemasons. Volumes of Rosicrucian/Freemasonic books are now glutting the market to the end of bringing forth the Merovingian vision of the 'new world order' governed by a \"wise and benign spiritual figure, a priest-king\" of the pedigree of Jesus Christ. The authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail are, however, prudent to assure the future serfs of their modern feudal system that the lineal descendant of Jesus - \"...would not be any more divine, any more intrinsically miraculous, than the rest of us. This attitude would undoubtedly be shared by a great many people today. We suspect it is shared by the Prieuré de Sion as well.\" By inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the Apostle Paul foretold that a usurper of the \"Temple throne\" would precede the \"coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,\" at which time many would believe a lie, even the divinity of man: \"Let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"exhalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God... \"And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. \"And for this cause God shall send them a strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\" II Th 2:2-12 THE HOUSE OF STEWART On 14 January 1998 the World Council of Churches reported the formation of the European \"Church and Society Commission.\" The stated purpose of this commission was to help European churches \"monitor and react to developments in institutions such as the European Union and the Council of Europe, and to deal with ethical questions facing European society.\" Ethical questions will encompass: \". . . peace, justice and the integrity of creation, reconciliation and relations between churches and governments . . . democratisation, human rights and minorities, European security, and the environment . . . (and) the specific responsibility of the churches in member states of the European Union for EU policies.\" (15) The January meeting took place in Strasbourg, the French city which houses the headquarters of the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights, and the European Parliament. It is significant that opening this session was Jacques Stewart, who described the meeting as \"historic\" and \"long awaited.\" The Stewart family are ubiquitous in the movement toward a global government and religion and, as we have seen, appear to be the Illuminati bloodline spearheading the Merovingian conquest of the Throne of Jerusalem. According to authors Baigent, et al, the Prieuré will soon to make its long awaited debut as the legitimate head of a one world theocracy, placing on the Throne of Jerusalem the physical heir of Jesus Christ. Notably, in 1992, Prince Michael Stewart of Albany was elected head of the European Council of Princes. Prince Michael is also acclaimed to be the 7th legitimate descendant from the exiled Charles Edward Stuart. On the web site of Bloodline Of The Holy Grail is found Sir Laurence Gardner's defense of the Stewart claim to the Thrones of Scotland and England, Sir Laurence himself being no less than \"Prior of the Celtic Church's Sacred Kindred of St Columba, Chevalier Labhran de Saint Germain and Presidential Attache to the European Council of Princes.\" Author of The Top 13 Illuminati Bloodlines , Fritz Springmeier believes the Stewarts to be the 13th Illuminati family from which the Antichrist will come. (16) The following is a partial listing of Stewarts who hold influential and powerful positions in the global network moving the world toward political and religious unity. Prince Michael Stewart of Albany Head of the European Council of Princes \"In June 1992, HRH Prince Michael James Alexander Stewart, 7th Count of Albany (Scotland) was elected President of the European Council of Princes -- a constitutional advisory body within the European Union. In this regard, he succeeded the Imperial and Royal House of Habsburg Austria, who had retained the office from 1946. The new appointment held significant political implications for Scotland because, in unanimously electing Michael of Albany, some 32 sovereign houses openly proclaimed the continuing de jure Scots monarchy to an international audience – a royal dynasty which, according to British academic historians, had long been extinct.\" (17) "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Jacques Stewart President, European Ecumenical Commission on Church and Society The EECCS has offices in Strasbourg and in Brussels, where the main EU headquarters are located.

Within hours after the Watch Unto Prayer expose was posted on November 6, 1997, the Scottish Stewart Clan Internet Home blocked access to their discussion groups for all except those having a secret password.

The Scottish Stewart Clan Internet Home is very esoteric for a Christian web site, with emphasis on the genealogies of various Scottish clans. New Age books such as Bloodline of the Holy Grail also emphasize genealogies, especially the Merovingian families, which include the Stewarts.

Jacob's Pillar (The Stone of Destiny) was believed to have been subsequently carried by Jeremiah - along with Zedekiah's two daughters - to Ireland. Later, it went to Scotland, then England. Most scholars, along with this writer, see these three moves associated with Ezekiel 21:27: 'I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.' \"...It will not be used ever again in the crowning of an earthly king because it has been announced that it will go on permanent display in Edinburg, Scotland. Therefore, this move obviously ended the Stone's role in the crowning of kings, ending with King George VI in 1936 ... the last king crowned over the Stone. That being the case, Messiah, according to Ezekiel, will be the next King over the House of David . . . so, the third 'overturn' is yet in effect. In light of these facts, as stated last month, this move (after some 700 years) would seem to be significant as to just how close the Lord's return could be. In other words, from Zedekiah forward, Israel, as a nation, would have no king until Messiah comes (Gen. 49:10) ...and true to prophecy, that has been the case. This means that the scattered and divided kingdom of Israel must be restored and Christ installed as her King...'the most holy' Dan. 9:24\" (30) Although there is disagreement as to which stone is the true Stone of Destiny, and whether it was Jacob's pillar or pillow, the preceding fable is nearly identical to the account presented in Bloodline of the Holy Grail by Laurence Gardner: \"Not only were the Grail Knights and Templars appointed Guardians of the Stewart Sangreal [Holy Grail] in Scotland, they also became protectors of the Stone of Destiny (the Stone of Scone). This most sacred of Scots treasures had been brought to Scotland from Ireland by Fergus Mor mac Erc, the first King of Dalriada, in the 5th century, having originally been carried to Ireland from Judah in about 586 BC. The venerated holy relic was said to be the Stone of the Covenant, known as 'Jacob's Pillow' (Gen. 28:18-22), on which Jacob laid his head and saw the ladder reaching up to Heaven at Beth-el. In a dream God promised Jacob that his seed would generate the line of kingship to follow - the line which in due course became the Davidic succession. \"When the Jews were persecuted by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, Mattaniah, the son of King Josiah (and a direct descendant of David), was installed in Judah. Known as King Zedekiah, he acceded to the throne of Jerusalem in 598 BC. Twelve years later Jerusalem fell to Nebuchadnezzar, whereupon Zedekiah was taken to Babylon and blinded (Jer. 39:6-7, 52:10-11). His sons were murdered, but his daughter Tamar was removed to Ireland (via Egypt and Spain) by the prophet Jeremiah. He also brought the anointed Stone of the Covenant, which became known as Lia Fail (Stone of Destiny). In Latin it was the Saxum Fatale. \"Princess Tamar (Teamhair) gave her name to Tara, the seat of the High Kings of Ireland, and she married Ard Ri (High King) Eochaid, ancestor of Ugaine Mar (Ugaine the Great). Subsequently, over a millenium, Eochaid's successors were crowned in the presence of the sacred Stone. The Irish heritage then progressed to Scotland, where the relic of Judah became synonymous with the Kings of Dalriada. King Kenneth (MacAlpin (844-859) later moved the Stone to Scone Abbey when he united the Scots and the Picts. By the time of William the Lion (d. 1214), the Stone of Destiny bore witness to nearly a hundred coronations in sovereign descent from King Zedekiah. \"On declaring himself Overlord of Scotland in 1296, Edward I of England stole what he thought was the Stone of Destiny. What he actually got was a piece of sandstone from a monastery doorway, which has since rested beneath the Coronation Throne at Westminster Abbey. This piece of rubble is 26 inches long by 11 inches deep (c. 66x 28 cm) and weighs about 335 lbs (c. 152 kg). Royal seals of the early Scots kings depict a much larger installation rock, but this rock was not the sacred Stone of Destiny -- no more"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"than is the medieval masonry prize of King Edward. The real Stone of Destiny is said to be smaller, more naturally rounded, and is of inscribed black basalt, not of hand-cut sandstone. It was hidden by the Cistercian Abbot of Scone in 1296, and it has remained hidden ever since. The Columbian tradition tells us that, on secreting the Stone, the Abbot prophesied that one day 'The Michael' would return to his inheritance.\" (31) The preceding fabrications of the origin of the Stone of Destiny present the false doctrine of British-Israelism, which propagates a variety of fictitious narratives intended to prove that the promises given to Israel in Scripture will be fulfilled in Britain, America, and other Anglo-Saxon countries. One version identifies the Anglo-Saxon race with the ten lost tribes of Israel which supposedly migrated to the British Isles following the Assyrian Captivity. According to other accounts which are presented in Holy Blood, Holy Grail and Bloodline of the Holy Grail , Jesus married Mary Magdalene and fathered children. After the crucifixion, Joseph of Arimethea took Mary and the children of Jesus to Europe. Needless to say, Scripture supports neither of these nor any other versions of the British-Israel doctrine. Among the Grail romances, the most famous is Parzival , composed by Wolfram von Eschenbach. In this mystical poem, the Grail is identified as a Philosopher's Stone upon which appear inscribed the names of the heirs of the throne of Jesus, typified by the phoenix, which will rise again and restore the inheritance of the Merovingian bloodline: \"You say you yearn for the Grail. You foolish man, I am grieved to hear that. For no man can ever win the Grail unless he is known in heaven and called by name to the Grail. This I must tell you about the Grail, for I know it to be so and have seen it for myself...By the power of that Stone the phoenix burns to ashes, but the ashes give him life again. Thus does the phoenix moult and change its plumage, which afterward is bright and shining and as lovely as before... \"Such power does the Stone give a man that flesh and bones are at once made young again. The Stone is also called the Grail. This very day there comes to it a message wherein lies its greatest power. Today is Good Friday, and they await there a Dove, winging down from heaven. It brings a small white wafer, and leaves it upon the Stone... \"Hear now how those who are called to the Grail are made known. On the Stone, round the edge, appear letters inscribed, giving the name and the lineage of each one, maid or boy, who is to make the blessed journey. No one needs to rub out the inscription, for once he has read the name, it fades before his eyes.\" (32) To the end of establishing the Scottish Stewart claim, the Stone of Scone page presents another aberrant interpretation of Scripture with which the credentials of the false messiah will seek validation. Ezekiel 37:19-22 is wrested from its proper Hebrew context and given a subtle British-Israel rendering. Note in the following excerpt that the Houses of Judah and Israel are identified as \"people\" rather than \"Jews\" exclusively. Thus, the Merovingian Messiah will unite the world, rather than the Jews, having first vanquished another false Christ, perchance the Pontiff of the Harlot Church. \"Verse 19: \"Say unto them (Israel), Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph (House of Joseph), which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah (House of Judah), and make them one stick (one nation), and they shall be one in *mine hand*.\" These sticks are literal wooden sticks which were used to represent the divided Kingdom of Israel which had become the House of Judah and the House of Israel. (See 1 Kings 11) The two sticks mentioned in Ezekiel are not books or scrolls -- they are people -- as the Scriptures will document. The sticks simply represent people. Note verses 16 & 17: 'Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions: And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.'"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"\"The word 'stick' is literal; that is, it means a stick of wood -- not a book or scroll. (See Strong's No. H6086) Therefore, in writing the name of Judah on one stick and the name of Joseph on the other, is simply showing the separation or division of God's People, Israel, and that by a miracle, He will rejoin them into one people. Our Father says that when asked about the meaning of this joining, tell them as follows: Verse 20: 'Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick (the House or people) of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim (whose leader was Ephraim -- at that time), and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah (join them with the House or people of Judah -- the remnant), and make them one stick (one people), and they shall be one (a single nation, as in the beginning) in mine hand.' Verse 22 con-firms that these two sticks represent people who have been scattered to the four winds -- but will be reunited when Christ returns; read carefully: \"'And I will make them *one nation* (one stick, one people) in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king (Christ) shall be king to them *all* (Shiloh; Whose right the Stone of Destiny represents): and they shall be no more two nations (two sticks), neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:' Can Christ be a King over anything except people? These two sticks being joined are specifically used to remind the descendants of Israel, even today, that they will yet be reunited into one nation -- a single people -- in the original land given to Abraham!.\" (33) Part II: T he Roman Dragon The Prieure du Notre Dame du Sion, or Priory of Zion, is said to be the cabal behind many of the events that occurred at Rennes-le-Chateau . According to the Prieure's own documents, its history is long and convoluted. Its earliest roots are in some sort of Hermetic or Gnostic society led by a man named Ormus. This individual is said to have reconciled paganism and Christianity. The story of Sion only comes into focus in the Middle Ages. In 1070, a group of monks from Calabria, Italy, led by one Prince Ursus, founded the Abbey of Orval in France near Stenay, in the Ardennes. These monks are said to have formed the basis for the Order de Sion, into which they were \"folded\" in 1099 by Godfroi de Bouillion. For about one hundred years, the Order of the Temple - Knights Templar - and Sion were apparently unified under one leadership, though they are said to have separated at the \"cutting of the elm\" at Gisors in 1188. (The Templar order was then destroyed by King Phillipe Le Bel of France, in 1307.) Sion appears to have been at the nexus of two French antimonarchical movements, the Compagnie du St.-Sacrament of the 17th century - acting on behalf on the Guise-Lorraine families - and the Fronde of the 18th, as well as behind an attempt to make the Hapsburgs emperors of all Europe in the 19th -- the Hieron du Val d'Or. It appears that there are vast connections between Sion and numerous sociocultural strata in European thought -- Roscicrucianism, Freemasonry, Arthurian and Grail legends, \"Arcadianism,\" Catharism, chivalry, etc. Yet this mysterious secret society brought itself to light in 1956 and is listed with the French directory of organizations under the subtitle \"Chivalry of Catholic Rules and Institutions of the Independent and Traditionalist Union,\" which in French abbreviates to 'circuit' -- the name of the magazine distributed internally among members. Depending on what statutes one considers, Sion either has 9,841 members in nine grades, or 1,093 members in seven, with the supreme member, the \"Nautonnier\" or Grand Master of the Order being, till 1963, Jean Cocteau. While it is believed the head has been Pierre Plantard de St.-Clair up until recent times, he claims to have left that post in 1984, so it is not clear who runs the organization at this time. But whoever he is, he has had illustrious predecessors: Jacques DeMolay, Leonardo de Vinci, Isaac Newton, and Claude Debussy, among others! Plantard, in any case, seems to have enjoyed the ear of many influential persons in contemporary French politics -- deGaulle, Marcel Lefebvre, Francois Ducaud-Bourget, Andre Malraux, and Alain Poher, and others, many of whom appear to know him from his efforts with the Resistance during the Vichy occupation. Despite its registry, however, the organization remains untraceable, its given address and number leading to dead ends -- which might lead one to wonder why the government never bothered to verify the information. Some interesting things have come to light about the Prieure recently. One is that the Swiss Grand Lodge Alpina (GLA), the highest body of Swiss Freemasonry (akin to the Grand Lodge of England), may have been the recruiting body for the Prieure. But the GLA is also said by some to be the meeting place of the \"Gnomes of Zurich\" who are said to be the Power Elite of Swiss bankers and international financiers. The GLA is said by David Yallop to be the body which controlled the P2 Masonic Lodge in Italy. (P2 controlled the Italian secret police in the 1970s, took money from the CIA and KGB, may have had a hand in the kidnapping of Aldo Moro by the Red Brigades, had 900 agents in other branches of the Italian government and the highest positions of the Vatican, bombed a train station and tried to blame it on the Communists, used the Vatican Bank to launder Mafia drug money, fomented fascist coups in South America, and is most likely linked to the arch-conservative Knights of Malta and Opus Dei in the Vatican.) P2's Lucio Gelli may have had a role in the death of John Paul I, and perhaps even the assassination attempt on John Paul II. One of the most interesting people to write about the Prieure may be Michael Lamy. He claims that Jules Verne was a member of both the Prieure and the Illuminati. Further, he maintains that the Prieure's politics must be understood as \"Orleanist,\" which he describes as \"aristocratic, anarchistic, and Nietzchean.\" Perhaps it all becomes most clear when Lamy reveals to the reader that the true secret of the village of Rennes-le-Chateau is that the extinct volcano Mount Bugarach leads down into the hollow earth to a realm of supermen. Ean Begg feels it is connected with many of the Black Virgin sites all over Europe. Certainly, if the organization's full name is the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Prieure de Notre Dame du Sion, and if it is site of Orval is connected to the worship of the bear-goddess Arduina, venerated by the Sicambrian Franks of the area and their Merovingian kings, then this may be the case. There are hints, of course, that \"Notre Dame\" is not the mother of Jesus, but Mary of Bethany AKA \"Magdalene\" a princess of the tribe of Benjamin, which is itself notorious for an outbreak of goddess-idolatry in the period of the Judges. That Mary may also be the one also known to the Gypsies of the south of France as one of the three \"Maries-de-la-Mer,\" whom they call \"Sarah the Egyptian,\" the sun-burnt one. Sailing and Grailing Across the Atlantic The most bizarre chapter in the story of Rennes-le-Chateau may have to do with the Money Pit mystery on Oak Island just off Nova Scotia. According to Michael Bradley, some of the keepers of the Grail may have come to the New World long before Columbus. He believes that some of the Templars may have fled to Canada after the dissolution of their order, carrying the Grail. The Money Pit has more often been associated with pirates' buried treasure, but as many know, the \"Jolly Roger\" flag's skull-and-crossbones icon has long been associated with Masonic and Templar legend. The so-called Venetian \"Zeno Map\" of the 15th century shows a knight with a sword standing where Nova Scotia is. (The Sinclairs of Scotland are \"hereditary lords of Rosslyn Chapel\" and are said to be descended from the Scots Guards, a clique loyal to the Stuart dynasty, which in turn are thought to have contained converted members of the Templar Order who fought with Robert the Bruce at Bannockburn, and to have provided the basis of Freemasonry.) In the Money Pit on Oak Island, a mysterious stone inscription was found: \"Forty feet below - two million punds are buried.\" Every company that has tried to locate this treasure has failed. Along with the supposed visits of Prince Madoc of Wales and St. Brendan of Ireland, Prince Henry the Navigator's trip to the New World with the Zeno brothers makes it one of numerous European pre-Columbian voyages. The Zeno map, along with those culled by Viking travelers, may have even helped Columbus make his way across the Atlantic. Recently, a UFO \"contactee\" in Canada who calls himself only \"Guardian\" speculated wildly about some \"Brotherhood of the Grail\" being operative there for centuries. Geographically speaking, there are in fact two Oak Islands, surrounding a central river, at the confluence of which is a mysterious ruin, which appears to be a fortress or old castle. It does appear that there may be strands connecting Rennes-le-Chateau and the New World. Ultimately, the Rosicrucian ideas behind the American experiment (as documented by Manly Palmer Hall) may have deeper \"Arcadian\" roots. Bradley hints, but does not come out and say, that what is beneath the Money Pit may be the Grail. It is not the only weird trail in the Rennes mystery. One researcher insists that the inventor Barnes Wallis was one of the most recent Grand Masters of Sion. Yet another feels it is worth pursuing the origins of the Cajun people of Louisiana. Others have even found connections to the so-called \"Baconian\" theory, which suggests that Sir Francis Bacon authored Shakespeare's plays. Bacon's works suggest a Rosicrucian experiment taking place in the New World. Fanthorpe seems to believe that ultimately Rennes-le-Chateau may be a \"doorway unto the invisible\" - a gateway to other dimensions, through the Emerald Tablet which he speculates may have been a tesseract (3-dimensional representation of a 4-dimensional figure). Other theories - Lincoln and his co-authors fashioned a theory that Christ had descendents who \"legged it to the south of France where they intermarried with the royal Franks to found what eventually became the mystical Merovingian Dynasty. Ergo, the real mission of the Templars and Priory of Zion: to safeguard not just the treasure of the Crusades, but to preserve the Grail, which appeared in medieval texts as 'Sangraal' or 'Sangreal', and which Lincoln et al. translated to mean sang real, or 'royal blood'. In other words: the dynastic legacy of Christ, literally. The Merovingians were considered in their day to be quasi-mystical warrior-kings vested with supernatural powers.\" The Merovingians traced their ancestry back to the Benjamites who, according to legend, has fled from Israel to Arcadia in Greece. \"Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair [was] apparently the source behind much of the recent literature devoted to the hilltown and its enigmatic priest. Shepherded to Paris's Bibliotheque Nationale, our trio of historical investigators discovered there a genealogy purporting to link Pierre Plantard to King Dagobert II and the Merovingian dynasty. \"Throughout these dossiers secrets at Paris's national library were tantalizing historical references to a mysterious and ancient secret society called Prieure de Sion, or Priory of Zion.\" \"Lincoln and company checked with the French authorities and discovered that there was indeed a contemporary organization calling itself Priory of Zion. And who do you think was registered as the group's secretary-general but none other than Pierre Plantard.\" \"The earliest roots of the Prieure de Sion are in some sort of Hermetic or Gnostic society led by a man named Ormus. This individual is said to have reconciled paganism and Christianity. The story of Sion only comes into focus in the Middle Ages. In 1070, a group of monks from Calabria, Italy, led by one Prince Ursus, founded the Abbey of Orval in France near Stenay, in the Ardennes. These monks are said to have formed the basis for the the Order de Sion, into which they were 'folded' in 1099 by Godfroi de Bouillion.\" \"The Order of Sion was founded in the 1090's by Godfroide Bouillon, one of the leaders of the First Crusade who had recaptured Jerusalem. They claim that it was this Order that lay behind Hugues of Champagne and the founding of the Templars.\" From - Baigent, Leigh & Lincoln, The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail \"The avowed and declared objective of the Prieure de Sion is the restoration of the Merovingian dynasty and bloodline - to the throne not only of France, but to the thrones of other European nations as well. By dint of dynastic alliances and intermarriages, this line came to include Godfroi de Bouillion, who captured Jerusalem in 1099, and various other noble and royal families, past and present.\" Godfroi was, by legend, a member of the Grail Family, and by lineage a Merovingian and apparently, rightful King of Jerusalem by his descent from David. It is clear that he was aware of this. When he left for the first crusade, he sold all of his property. He intended to stay in Jerusalem. Godfroi was close to de Payen and the count of Champagne, and Baudoin [his brother] was integral to the founding of the Templars.\" \"One might therefore term Godfroi de Bouillon as a sort of 'king of kings', or at least a maker of kings, since he founded the Order of Sion that could crown Kings of Jerusalem.\" \"To the south of Jerusalem looms the 'high hill' of Mount Sion.\" By 1099 an abbey had been built on the ruins of an old Byzantine basilica at the express command of Godfroi de Buoillon. \"According to one chronicler, writing in 1172, it was extremely well fortified, with its own walls, towers and battlements. And this structure was called the Abbey of Notre Dame du Mont de Sion.\""},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"\"In 1979, M.

The treasure, M. Plantard stated, would be returned to Israel 'when the time is right.'\" \"At some point, according to Lincoln et al., the treasure had passed from the Merovingians to the Priory of Zion----> Templars took the treasure from the Holy Land to the French Cathars, who, on the eve of their destruction by the church, squirreled the lucre away in the Pyrenees.\""}]
