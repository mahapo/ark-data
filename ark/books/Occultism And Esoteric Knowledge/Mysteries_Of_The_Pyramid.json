(The author's f ather was a priest. R.Ø.re mark.) Just week s prio r to this expedition' s discov ery of the hidden entrance on the oute r shell of the Pyramid, a caravan o f scienti sts from a Cali fornia Unive rsity had just completed their external exa mination of this structure, using a cosmic and ga mma x-ray device to deter mine whether o r not Gizeh was hiding any secret pas sages or rooms that were undetected from the internal viewing. when these rays were focused on the P yram id, any solid por tion would i mmediatel y bounce these rays back, or be delayed should any i nner opening absorb the rays longer than necessary. This exa mination did reveal the obvious delays for its nor mal inner passagew ays and its well-known cha mbers. What the y did not know was the absorption o f split se conds (millionth of a second) that actuall y indicated a secret stairway r unning directl y behind the King's and Queen' s Cha mber, for here we are speaking of a large opening with only a 29 inch (74c m)pa ssageway d irectly in line with these x-rays. Such a nar row pa ssage could obviousl y be missed and below these Cha mbers, the structural casing wa s entirel y too thick to e mit such rays as f ar in as this stairca se wa s located. Thus this University experi mental exa mination revealed nothing m ore than the usual inner openings and no inner pass ages. However , a select few people of this expedition (including t his author ) were well aware o f a se cret ent rance and so me sort of an inner pas sageway that up to that date in Jun e 1976 had es caped detection from those who scanned its surfac es with the fin est of instru ments. As I indicated in this book's introduction, the ent rance was only discovered after forty years of intensi fied research, m ishaps, trials and errors and the interference by t he Egyptian govern ment official s. In entering the P yramid through this secret passag e, one m ust accept the f act that if anyone were discovered during this process, either b y the E gyptian o fficials or the guards of the grounds, i mprison ment or execution would be the i mmediate order of the day with no a mnesty for those who participated in such an atrocit y against that govern ment. To re-b rief you of the secret entrance s to the subterranean cha mbers, there are two unknown routes (now known to all who read this docu mentation). One such entrance is located near the top of the P yramid where m agnetic forces play a major role in the actual door opening, (exact location to be withheld) and the other being an under the base of the hidden to mb, or Cha mber o f records. The exact entrance location, near the top, was not really pinpointed until a thorough exa mination was made of every stone within a range of ten ter raced layers and ever y block between - to the apex. Even after the ancient scrolls were"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"translated, much difficulty arose in finding the exact stone that show ed only a hairline crack between the actual ce ment fill and the stone itself. Simply walking past each stone at a ver y slow pace would not reveal such a tiny hairline crack and for this reason, m any frustrating m onths passed without a trace o f such a block that would slide inward b y a m ere verbal co mmand (using the p roper key words and vibrational pitch ). (the y seemed to use a taperecorde r for this and had understood that it had so mething to do with sound after long interpreted the or iginal s criptu re found in Greece .R.Ø.re mark.) The exact entrance to the Temple of the Sphinx has also remained a wellguarded secret, although after 10,978 yea rs, it is now known to a sel ect few . This Temple is a shrine of extre me beauty wi th its breathtaking splendor of gold inlays with spra ys of precious jewel s at the se cret altar , arches o f unusual architecture, highly polished marble walls of a pinkish tint and pure silver floor inlays of unusu al hierogl yphics. Somewhere on the maze of marble walls and abut ments, lay a secret door and a downward pas sage to the tomb beneath the P yramid o f Gizeh. Today, both the Py ramid and the Sphinx are heavil y guarded b y a 24-hou r vigil of armed Egyptians - and tourists tread a thin line around and within a structure. To enter fro m the top of the P yram id's secret entrance, one m ust be directl y in front of a speci fic stone ye t having a mple room to m aneuver if and when succ ess was reached this one and this particular stone began to m ove. When two of the m en were ready with the key wo rds and a belief they had the proper vib rational tones, no one wa s sure how such a stone would m ove - if at all. For the few skeptics that are inherited in ever y group, the m ovement of one o f these stones was not on ly impossible and i mpractical but also totally unhea rd of in any scientific theory. Thus they were certain that the 40 yea rs devoted to this rese arch was in reality a hoax of some ancient who devis ed a sch eme to thr ill those who sought out the m eaning of those scrolls, originall y discovered just outside Athens, Greece in 1936. Although all m embers of this expedition supported so me feelings of truth to those informative scrolls, still to a degree leaned toward t races of skepticis m in thei r deep beliefs. Before an actual attempt could be m ade in tr ying out va rious verbal vib rations, much preparation had to be taken under consideration. R esearch had to be done to clock the rounds of the parading guards, when the y were relieved and when, if at all, did they discontinue their v igil (våkning)of the Py ramid's exterior. It was recorded that each group of eight gua rds changed hand s every four hours and were clocked for dut y from 6 A.M. to thei r final dis missal at 6 P.M. This was a twelve- hour shift and since all tou rists had to vacate the P yram id by 4:30 P .M., their last shift clos ed at the end o f the twelve-hour i nterval. Due to delays of various"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"guards men, no m ove could be anticipated be fore 8 P .M. The one re maining guard at the Py ramid's entrance presented no proble m, since his position wa s at the opposite facing to the secret entrance o f the south wall. The first date for this unusu al venture was scheduled for March 5,1976 when the moon shed no light and would rem ain for four hours. The fir st atte mpt was futile (fågjeve s)and to the discourage ment of the eleven who were on this private expedition, m any mo re futile nights followed in rap id succession until exhaustion set in after their atte mpt of the 20th t ry. Many t rips to the height of 450 f eet were made regardles s of the m oon reflections, for inas much as they we re neve r spotted; their atte mpts beca me bolder ( dristigere)wi th each intended cli mb, and toward their last visits. There was little or no fear of being caught. A total of 37 atte mpts were m ade in this serie s of trial and error . On each trip, generally involving six m embers of the eleven, the ke y words were uttered in m any verbal tone vibrations, ye t they failed to get any r espon se to an opening of the stone. After the third dozen atte mpts, frustration and m ore sincere sk epticis m began to seep in with all other m ixed emotion s. This repeated cli mbing finally took its toll among the members of the crew and in the last f ew atte mpts the nu mber in the party dwindled to just three scout s who were o f a diehard m akeup that would not quit. This clim bing exhibition lasted from March 5th to June 6th before there was any inward fe eling of succe ss. It was the early hou rs of m orning of Jun e 7,1976 that, in the silent o f the night, something was heard in the direction of this one particular stone. Searchlight involving onl y a piercing bea m (and not a flood of light for obvious reasons) show ed onl y tiny speck s of loose cement at both its vertical edges - but nothing more. Since we knew every inch and degree of inches around that one stone, it was immediatel y apparent that this tiny deb ris was not there when the arrival was made. Some movement must have taken place and so mething created a strange sound. Other t han these two unusu al happenings, that evening of the seventh wa s totally unevent ful. It was not until the wee morning hours of June 9th (June 7th b y the L unar calculation) that suc cess was achieved, and b y mere accident. Our voice recorde r (of tone vibrations) was turned on accidentall y when Amend Abouu stooped over to step down and begin to m ake an exit. R esults occur red immediately . This 15 ton block began to slide inward at a slow pace, creating with its m ovement a sound of stone rolling over pebbles, yet not reall y this type sound. The precise time was seven minutes past the fourteenth hour of midday (fourteen and sev en is 21) or seven minutes after 2 A.M. of the 9th of June. Apparentl y, as we reasoned later , the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"time divisible by seven o f the exact day plus the correct tone vibration of the key words led to the secret of the opening. The stone block r olled (o r slid) inward for a distance o f not m ore than seven feet, leaving only a clearing of a m ere three fe et (90c m)due to the block protrusion of the under lay ers. Instead of jumping at the chanc e to dash into t he opening, hesitation was the theme of the next few seconds - due mainly to shock and total surprise. The decision wa s finally reached (and none too soon) and the three scout s hurriedly clim bed down its pitch-black m outh and just as the r ight hand of the third member was pulled free into the opening, the giant block slid s moothly over the underla y stone. The total ti me of opening and closing totaled just 35 second s with 49 se conds to its final resting place on the exterio r facing. On entering, the lead scout, Amend Abouu had m ade a m isstep in the dark pas sage and plunged (stupe)forward down a flight of a dozen stairs. By the tone of his voice one would imagine he had been seriously hu rt but as it turned out, it was only his pride that suffered the agon y - and the dust that was suddenly sti rred created a choking experience, delaying the descent for m any minutes. This opening o f the stone simply did not occur after just 37 atte mpts from the fir st initial tr y but was tried m any dozens of times prior to being at that location.

Eight m onths prior to June 9th, a m ockup of this area was reproduced - Holl ywood style - in a secluded (bortg jemt)area south of the Py ramid to the exactnes s of duplication. Knowing, a fter all research was completed, the m en that would enter would have limited ti me - thus this mockup, on a ti mer, served as a prope r evaluation to learn of the fa stest way in, ju mping, sliding or squeezing in the allotted ti me and to deter mine, after practice, how m any it would ad mit before the last few inches clo sed around the m.

For those who did not actually see this disappearance still had a pre monition it had to be so and they had succeeded. The vigil ( våkningen)of the wait see med endles s for no one knew if or when the scouts would r eturn to the exterio r of that south f acing of the P yramid. The great stone block had now co mplet ed its 49-second cycle and the chosen three were entrapped within the Py ramid's secret pas sage, not actually knowing what they had done, wh y they had done this, and where such a nar row stairca se would lead. They also had the sudden realization they had no food, water , extra batteries or the s mallest of first aid kits for arising e mergencie s. To prevent a creeping illnes s of their con scious mind, all of these thoughts had to be immediately dismissed and since they were now entrapped on this inner staircase, there was only one choice and one direction. These three entertained verbally what they were think ing which led the m to expound on the idea that perhaps this stone would not open again by t he same verbal tone and e speciall y from the reverse position. They did envision the possibilit y of being sealed up forever and a day and the fruits of their labor being in vain. Here, on this darkened and dust filled staircase, they wondered if these 40 years of rese arch would pa y off and would the y be the bene factors of this unknown discov ery. The pas sage chamber was narrow , steep and the walls were of jagged cut stone. One wrong m ove again st the side s could cut a m an as quickly as that of coral rock - and be even more infe ctious with the exce ssive dust, m ildew ( mugg)and a ger m count ranging into the t rillions. Once inside they knew what was so de speratel y needed to continue such a jou rney. For one thing, a fla sk of bourbon would help wash the dust from their mouths; addit ional batte ries; cand y bars f or ext ra energy, water , a camera and search lights that could pierce the constant dust clouds.

Looking at this situation on a scienti fic basi s, many secrets o f our ancient past remain a well guarded se cret and these people, who once inhabited a continent of great technologies, did know the int ricate details of unusual elect ronic s, teleportation, ther monuclear energy, liquid ligh t power (without the use o f electricity ), the unseen power of m ercury and the art of levitation through sound vibrations. With this f irmly p lanted within y our mind, such a sliding stone remains a deep and darkened secret but if explained, it would beco me simple facts of scientific logic. Once you have entered through the opening created b y this sliding stone block, yo u stand in pitch -blackne ss and observe a silence that is unmatch ed by a nor mal or abnor mal circu mstance. Once yo u have beco me adjusted to such a strange experience and know y ou are ento mbed, perhaps f orever , your first reaction is a desperate and panic-stricken ur ge to get out, breathe fre sh air and leave this imprisoning seclu sion to another generation. Dur ing that f irst hour of exa mining the inner side of the block, the verbal key wo rds and the Identical tonepitch were used over and over but t o no avail. Such an experience to any one would create an inward fe ar that once there, the re was no return to t he outside world. I n such a darknes s, even with the aid of three fla sh lights, you are immediately struck b y an intense claustrophobia which is only matched by the pungent odors of mildew(bittte r lukt av m ugg), sli me and a near-choking dust formation, that when disturbed, flo ats around yo u in billowing clouds that tend to close o ff whatever air there m ight be left to breathe. This point of entry was not too far from the built i n air sha fts of the Pyramid and an airway had to inwardly extend to this stairwa y, for if this were not the ca se, life could not have been sust ained longer than the a mount of air admitted when the opening wa s created. Even though no t race of air movement could be detected, there was air, but not of the freshe st of scents(lukt). I t was breathable only when the dust clouds were kept at an absolute m inimum, which was totall y impossible.

Each co mplete set of stairs contained 57 steps and at the end of the 57th, a s mall plat form was provided and again st the outer wall, one scant slab (plate-) bench, barely large enough to seat one thin m an.

The only scientific value it could have had wa s some sort of an inner support or it had so mething to do with the original construction of such a passagew ay. (M issing ph oto) The journe y down was more treacherous than anticipated with each step creating a bellowing of settled dust that had to m easure several inches thick on each tread(t rinn). Between each m inor dust stor m, the pungent odors of mildew , slime cover treads beneath the dust, and stale air , the journe y was a hazardous one. The main fear was the possibility of choking by the dust and slipping on the stair edge s. The prot ruded (fre mstikkende)sl abs did provide so me aid at inte rval steps but was only adaptable for one m an at a time while the other stood on the inadequatel y ledged (avsat s)platfor m. Water to wash down the dust in their throats would have been worth all of the gold at Fo rt Knox and it was a m atter of concern if such a descent was to be co mpleted, with its depth and destination totally unknown. The thought that originall y crossed two of the m inds in the beginning was the pos sible fact that this descent wa s not of any great distance and perhaps in the translation, it could have been a to mb roo m just opposite the King' s Cha mber. Thirst could not be satis fied by the sipping of bourbon, f or if so, and one sipped more than he should, the ef fects of the liquor could have created disa strous results with a si mple fall on the staircase. If a fall and inju ry occurred, it m ay take days or even weeks to get out of this devil' s den and a serious injur y could be fat al without any m edical aid, water o r food. Therefore, this descent was one of extre me caution and a s a m atter of record, each step with the wait for the dust to resettle took m ore than three m inutes.

This descent took m ore than ten hours and an even greater apprehension was that these steps had to be retraced back to the secret opening. The clim b down put these three scout s in such a complete stat e of exhaustion, by the time they r eached the botto m, they had neithe r the intent nor desire to ever atte mpt the cli mb back up -ever .

How this was to be opened re mained another my stery and none of the three m en had the strength to even think o r hazard a num ber of gues ses. Fortunately , the thought did arise that su ch a closure might operate in the sa me manner as the sliding block at the ent rance. A verbal key and tone vib ration had to be the onl y possible answer , for if these key words opened the sliding rock at the top, it should, by the s ame token(likeledes), open the bottom.

They rever ted to the process of even reversing the tape and in doing so, one ver y slight m ovement wa s noticed but if the doo r actually moved, it could not have been m ore than a tiny fraction of the inch. Suddenl y it occurred to Abouu that since we were now at the opposite end of this pas sage, the reversal o f the words should have been us ed - in t he same tone vibration. Using the words 'Uri m,' meaning light or revelation for the m ain stone, the reve rsal of this should be injected at this time. Anothe r dozen tries revealed nothing until one member simply mumbled the word Genesi s and appa rently he struck it co rrectly . The giant m etal door slowl y started on its upward m ovement - to the co mplete astoni shment of all concerned. The sound was that of a motor hum , although there were no visible motors or electricity . Thus if a motorized operation was its only means of m ovement, it had to be hidden above the doo r or the coiling of that r oom or foyer .

To have f ound such a sealed chamber, buried hundreds of feet below the Py ramid, and for m ore than 5,000 ye ars (modest figure) - with no t race of foul air , moss covered walls or dirt, was not only a mysterious factor but also a m odem miracle.

The word 'teleportation', in an y laym an's language, refers to an instant transf erence o f a body or object fro m any given place - to another point of time or space without the use of a physical f orce of a visible trace ment. It is the proces s in which a body see ms to de materialize and reappear at so me distant point, si milar to the science f iction stories of the ' Time Machine\" o f the m otion pictu re, \"Star Trek\" where people are teleported to earth fro m a space craft. The records indicate that regardless of any dematerialization p rocess, whether i t is acco mplished by instru mentation by higher technologies or involving a spiritual transfor mation, it is only a matter than can be acco mplished by a rea rrange ment of atom structures, whether it be in a hu man form or of a solid m aterial. Teleportation is therefore a process that takes place within a bill ionth o f a se cond. The details of it working unde r forms of instru mentation are beyond the comprehension of present man. With all transferals of a body or an object, there is error and uncalculated dangers by both earthlings and hu manoid. Teleportation is"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"only acco mplished in split-second timing and beyond that billion th of the se cond, the trans feral is lost forever . As an exa mple worth re membering, the telepo rtation proces s, if delayed once it begin s, could transf er one into a dif ferent ti me dimension or if the separation o f atoms are used for entering a solid wall, such a hesitation of a split second could i mprison one within that wall th rough all eternit y. The records of this to mb reveal two for ms of teleportation. One is through varied instru mentation where ra ys of light are pla yed on the body or object, using 'liquid light' fi ssion, the co mplexity of an ato m separator and a m agnetic f orce field for mere second s. Then the instant proces s begins on the bod y or object in which it begins to rap idly fade fro m sight - t o be reconstructed at a dif ferent destination at the very same moment, regardless of distance. If yo u are f amiliar with the television series \"Star Trek,\" this form of telepo rtation is somewhat accurate but the delay shown in this filming is not accurate. The entire proces s of teleportation only lasts, fro m its beginning to the co mplet e transf er a total of three se conds, and of these three, only one bil lionth of a second is required to c reate the te mporary rearrange ment of the structural ato ms. As you are well aware, every thing that exists in this universe, including solid forms, a living hu man or a spiritual soul - consist s of an ato m composite or an atom structure. Your bod y and y our soul are ato ms but vary in their densit y and since atoms are matter, they can never be destroyed. They can accept change fro m one f orm to anothe r and they can be rear ranged on a te mporary basis - but the y cannot be destro yed. Atoms that are also the breath of all life can be changed from the invisible to solids. They can be a hu man one da y and a spiritual soul the next; they can be split for the use of explosive powe r (ato m bomb) or the y can be separated for the use of perpetual energy. Thus, from this m icroscopic, invisible particle co mes life and all that we witnes s here on earth and in the universe. The Alien, and or those great ancients, us ed the fulle st power of the m ind. They used these atoms as knowledge for ener gy, teleportation, c ranial intervision ( mind reading), spacecra ft, powers to heal, telekinesis, levitation and the elongation of their own life span to m ore than 1,000 y ears (earth count). Teleportation, othe r than with the help o f instru mentation, has been applied just through the powers o f the universal mind.

None of the Mayan transcripts bore out precise locations of their residency , their under ground cities or date s of their achieve ments. From the m icrofil med metal disc s, we were fortunate in lea rning the whereabout s of at least seven major openings.

According to all that has been recorded in the archives of this to mb, we have here, on this earth, twin worlds that are either m atching or the y are of two separate entities and the later I prefer to believe. For those of you who r emain doubtful of the pos sibilit y of a twin wo rld, let one stress the point that beneath our ve ry surface there are thousand s of miles of tunnels, dozen s of submerged lakes, hundreds or more miles in under ground rive rs, enor mous caverns that a re within our ten m ile crust. There are the volcanoe s that extend their-massive sha fts to depths o f eight to twelve miles into the earth's abyss, with canal roots (passag eways) piercing to depths of four hund red miles. Burned out volcanoes are a natural network of passages and cavern s that eventually lead to the deeper po rtions of our inner ea rth and in so me areas of the interior , vast cities could have been built. Three thousand yea rs ago, in Ind ia, transcripts were uncovered that strongl y indicated our earth was inhabited b y space vehicles, whose occupant s exist ed below our surfa ces.

There are, at present, an abundance of existing tunnels in South America, Yucatan, the des erts of Egypt, and in the li mestone vaults below northern Russi a, India, I ndo China, many regions of the United States and throughout the whole of the African continent. Such tunnels, as are de scribed b y the Mayans and the Agarthians, are in e ffect breathing tubes for the inner caverns, with acce ss to and fro m the varied surfa ces throughout the wo rld. The number of openings are guided by the size o f the cavern and the area covered b y an inner civil ization, thus proving t hat South America features m ore openings (other than direct pass ages) due to the main stem of caverns.

A remarkable thing occurs when y ou draw lines to and fro m these de stinations, f or after a little juggling, all lines eventuall y form giant tr iangle s - or global py ramids. Each of these seven py ramids have one co mmon bond, in that the y are (o r were) interconnected below the earth's sur face - in the for m of what was referred to as \"trans-tubes\" or \"ligh t vehicle s\" (light m eaning their powe r source.) This vast and complex network of undersurface tunnels is unlike an y engineering feat we are capable of designing or even co mprehending. We are talking of the or iginal network having had an exce ss of 300,000 mi les, where as now its vastne ss has been reduced to a m ere 32,000 mi les, due to under ground and surf ace quake s, flooding and varied land shift s, that would virtuall y destroy many areas of these inner earth tunnels.

They are perfectly straight with onl y a few slowl y angled curves to help change the course of direction.

Local 19th- centur y Arab lore maintained that existing under the Sphinx are secret cham bers hold ing treasures or m agical objects. That belief was bolstered by the writings of the first- centur y Roman historian Pliny, who wrote tha t deep below the Sphinx is conceal ed the \"tomb of a ruler named Harm akhis tha t conta ins great treasure\", and, strange ly enough, the Sphinx itself was once cal led \"The Great Sphinx Har makh is who moun ted guard since the time of the Followers of H orus \" . The fourth-centur y Rom an histor ian Ammianus Marce llinus m ade addi tional disclosures about the exist ence of subterr anean vaults that appeared to lead to the inter ior of the Great pyramid (3): Inscriptions which the ancients asserted wer e engraved on the walls of certain under ground galleri es and pas sageswer e constructed deep in th e dark interior to preserve ancien t wisdom f rom being lost in the flood.

During the examination, it was filled with water and weighed, then emptied and re-weighed. The historian wrote that it was \"found to be of the sa me weight when e mpty as when full of water\" . If the chroni cle is accura te, tha t lack of addi tional weight provided indire ct evid ence of the exist ence of an extraord inary scien ce at Giza. According to Masoudi in the 10th cen tury, mechanic al statues with amazing capab ilities guarded subterranean galleries under the Great Pyramid.

Masoudi contended that \"writt en accoun ts of Wisdom and acquire ments in the dif fer- ent arts and scien ces were hidden deep, tha t they might remain as records for th e benefi t of those who could afterwards co mpreh end them \". That is phenom enal infor mation, as it is possible that, since the times of Masoudi, \"worth y\" persons have seen th e mys- terious under ground cha mbers.

They constantl y claimed that i t was not a to mb nor a buria l chamber of an y kind, excep t that it did have one cha mber for s ymbolic buria l as part of an ini tiation ritual. According to m ystical tradit ions, the in terior was entered gradu- ally and in various stages via under ground pas sagewa ys . Different chambers were said to have existed at the end of each phase of progress, with the highest and ulti mate initiatory stage represen ted by the now-called King' s Cha mber . Little by little, the tradit ions of the mystery schools were veri- fied by archaeo logical discover ies, for it was ascer tained in 1935 that ther e was a subterranean connect ion betwe en the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid and tha t a tunne l conne cted the Sphinx to the ancient temple located on its southern side (tod ay called th e Temple of the Sphinx).

Around the same time, the intern ationa l news me dia rele ased further details of th e find.

That passagewa y had been unearth ed a few y ears before the release and publica tion of that part icular newspaper arti cle. The discoveries led Dr Seli m Hassan and others to bel ieve and public ly state that, while the age of the Sphinx was alwa ys enigmatic in the past, it may have been part of the grea t arch itectural plan th at was delib erately arrang ed and carr ied out in association with the erect ion of the Great Pyramid. Archaeo logists m ade another major discover y at that time. Around halfwa y between the Sphinx and Khephren's P yramid were discover ed four enor mous vertica l shafts, each around eigh t feet square, lead ing straigh t down through solid limeston e.

Dr Seli m Hassan reve aled that not onl y are there inner and outer courts, but the y also found a room they named the \"Chape l of Offering\" tha t had been cut into a huge, rock outcrop between Campbell's Tomb and the Great P yramid. In the centre of the chapel are three ornate vertica l pillars standing in a tr iangular shaped l ayout. Those pi llars are highl y signif icant points in this study, for th eir exist ence is recorded in the Bib le. The conclusion drawn is tha t Ezra, the initiated Torah writer (c. 397 BC), knew the subterranean layout of pas sages and cha mbers at Giza before he wrote the Torah. That under ground design was probabl y the origin of the triangul ar shaped la yout around the centr al altar in a Masonic lodg e. In Antiqu ities of the Jews, J osephus, in the first century, wrote that Eno ch of Old Testament fame construct ed an under ground te mple consisting of nin e cha mbers.

EVER- BURNIN G LAMP S In spite of am azing discover ies, the stark truth is that th e earl y histor y of Eg ypt remains lar gely unknown and therefor e unmapp ed terr itory. It is not possible, th en, to sa y precisely how m iles of under ground passagewa ys and cha mbers benea th the Giza Plat eau were lit, but one thing is for sure: unl ess the ancients could see in the dark, the vast subterran ean are as were som ehow illu minated. The same question is addressed of the inter ior of the Great Pyramid, and Eg yptologists have agreed tha t flaming torch es were not used, for ce ilings had not been bl ack-ened with residual smok e. From what is currentl y known abou t subsurfac e passagewa ys under the P yramid Plateau, it is po ssible to det ermine that there are at least three miles of passagewa ys 10 to 12 store ys below ground lev el. Both the Book of the Dead and the P yramid Texts ma ke striking referen ces to \"The Light- makers\", and that extr aor- dinar y descript ion m ay have referred to a bod y of peop le respon- sible for light ing the subterranean areas of the ir complexes. Iamblichus record ed a fascin ating account that was found on a very ancient Egyptian pap yrus held in a m osque in Cairo. It was part of a 100 BC stor y by an unknown author about a group of peopl e who gained entry to under ground cham bers around Giza for explor atory purposes. They describ ed the ir experi ence: We came to a chambe r. W hen we enter ed, it became auto- matica lly illumina ted by light from a tube be ing the height of one man's hand [ app rox. 6 inch es o r 15.24 cm ] and thin, standing vertica lly in the co rner .

It was common pract ice among ear ly Egyptians to seal light ed lamps in the sepulchr es of their dead as of ferings to their god or for the deceased to find the ir way to the \"other side\". Among the tombs near Me mphis (and in the Brahm in temples of Indi a), ligh ts were found oper - ating in sealed cha mbers and vessels, but sudden exposure to air ext inguished th em or caused their fuel to evaporate.(6) Greeks and Ro mans later followed the custo m, and the trad ition beca me gener ally estab lished-not only that of actu al burning lamps, but minia- ture reproduct ions ma de in terraco tta were buried with the dead. Some lamps were enc losed in c ircular vessels for protect ion, and instan ces are recorded where th e origina l oil was found perfectl y preserved in the m after more than 2,000 y ears. There is am ple proof fro m eyewitnesses that lamps were burning when the sepul- chres were sealed, and it was declar ed by later bystanders that they were stil l burning when the vaults were opened hundreds of years later. The possibility of preparing a fuel th at would renew itself as rapid ly as it was consu med was a source of considerabl e contro- versy among mediaeval authors, and nu merous docum ents exist outlining their arguments. After due considera tion of evidence at hand, it see med well within the range of possibili ty that ancient Egyptian priest-che mists manufa ctured lamps tha t burned if not indef initely then at least for consider able periods of ti me. Numerous author ities have writt en on the subject of ever - burning lamps, with W.

Some believ e the fabled perpe tual lamps of temples to be cunning mechanical con- trivances, and some quite hum orous explana- tions have been extended. In Eg ypt, rich under ground deposits of asphal t and petro leum exist, and some would have it that priests connected asbestos wicks by a secret duct to an oi l deposit, which in turn conne cted to one or m ore lamps.

I wa s to ld very credibl y that unde rground chambe rs and pas sages conne cted this pyramid with the pyramids at Memphis. undergr ound passages connecting p yramids The pyramids at Mem phis were the pyramids at Giza, for Giza was original ly called Memph is (see referen ce, \"Giza form erly Mem phis\" on Nordan' s map from Travels in Eg ypt and Nubia, 1757, on page 152 of previous chapt er). Many ancient writers supported Herodotus' record of under ground passages conne cting major pyramids, and their ev idence casts doubt on the reliability of traditionally presented Egyptian histor y . Crantor(300 BC) stated that th ere were certain under ground pill ars in Eg ypt that contain ed a writt en stone record of pre- histor y , and the y lined ac cessways con- necting the p yramids. In his celebr ated study, On the Mysteries, parti cularl y those of the Egyptians, Chaldeans and the Assyrians, Iamblichus, a fourth-cen tury Syrian represen ta-tive of the Alexandr ian School of m ystical and phi losophical studies, recorded this infor -mation about an entrancewa y through the bod y of th e Sphinx into the Great Pyramid (2): This entrance, ob struc ted in ou r day by s ands and rubbish, m ay still be traced betw een the for elegs of the crouched colossus, It was for merly closed by a br onze gate whose sec ret spring cou ld be operated only by the Magi. It was gua rded by publi c r espec t, and a sort of r eligious fear mainta ined its invio labil ity better than armed p rotec tion would have done. In the bel ly of the Sphinx we re cut out gall eries lead ing to the subterranean pa rt of the Great Pyramid. These gal leries wer e so a rt- fully crissc rossed along their cou rse to the Pyramid that, in setting forth into the pas sage wi thout a guid e thr oughout this network, one ceasingl y and ine vitab ly r eturned to th e starting poin t. It was recorded in anc ient Sumerian cylinder seals that the secre t abode of the Anunnaki was \"an under ground place. . . ent ered through a tunnel, its entr ance hidden b y sand and by what they call Huwana. . .his tee th as the teeth of a dragon, his face the face of a lion\". That remark able old text, unfortunat ely fragmented, added tha t \"He [Hu wana] is unable to mo ve forward, nor is he able to move back\", but the y crept up on him from behind and the way to \"the secret abode of the Anunnak i\" was no longer blocked. The Sum erian record provid ed a probabl e descrip tion of th e lion- headed Sphinx at Giza, and if tha t great creature was buil t to guard or oblit erate ancien t stairwa ys and lower passages le ading to subterranean areas below and around it, then its symbolism was most appropriat e. Local 19th- centur y Arab lore maintained that existing under the Sphinx are secret cham bers hold ing treasures or m agical objects."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"That belief was bolstered by the writings of the first- centur y Roman historian Pliny, who wrote tha t deep below the Sphinx is conceal ed the \"tomb of a ruler named Harm akhis tha t conta ins great treasure\", and, strange ly enough, the Sphinx itself was once cal led \"The Great Sphinx Har makh is who moun ted guard since the time of the Followers of H orus \" . The fourth-centur y Rom an histor ian Ammianus Marce llinus m ade addi tional disclosures about the exist ence of subterr anean vaults that appeared to lead to the inter ior of the Great pyramid (3): Inscriptions which the ancients asserted wer e engraved on the walls of certain under ground galleri es and pas sageswer e constructed deep in th e dark interior to preserve ancien t wisdom f rom being lost in the flood. A manuscr ipt compiled by an Arab writer named Altelemsan i is preserved in the British Mu seum, and it records the existence of a long, square, unde r-ground passage betwe en the Great Pyramid and the River Nile with a \"strange thing\" block ing the Nile entr ance. He relat ed the following episode : In the days of Ahmed Ben T ouloun, a pa rty entered the G reat pyra mid through the tunnel and fo und in a side-cha mber a goble t of glass of ra re co lour and tex ture. As they were leav- ing, they missed one of the party and, u pon retur ning to seek him, he ca me o ut to the m n aked and laughing said, \"Do n ot follow or seek fo r me \" , a nd then rus hed back into the pyra mid. His friends perceiv ed that he wa s enchanted. Upon learn ing about strange happen ings under the Pyramid, Ahmed Ben Touloun expressed a desire to see the goblet of glass. During the examination, it was filled with water and weighed, then emptied and re-weighed. The historian wrote that it was \"found to be of the sa me weight when e mpty as when full of water\" . If the chroni cle is accura te, tha t lack of addi tional weight provided indire ct evid ence of the exist ence of an extraord inary scien ce at Giza. According to Masoudi in the 10th cen tury, mechanic al statues with amazing capab ilities guarded subterranean galleries under the Great Pyramid.

Old records con firmed Herodotus said Eg yptian priests reci ted to him their long- held trad ition of \"the forma-tion of under ground apart ments\" b y the original developers of Memph is.

An anteroo m much like a burial chamber, but \"undoubted ly a room of initi ation and recep tion \"(5) w as found higher up the plateau closer to the Great Pyramid and at the upper end of a slop- ing passage, cut deep into rock on the northwest side of the Chamber of Of fering (between the Cham ber of Of fering and the Great Pyramid). In th e centr e of the chamber is a 12-foot long sarcophagus of white Turah li mestone and a coll ection of fine alabaster vessels. The walls are beautifu lly sculpt ed with scenes, inscrip tions and e mblems of particu larly the lotus flower . The descrip tions of alab aster vessels and the e mblematic lotus flower have remarkab le para llels with what was found in the temple- workshop on the sum mit of Mt Sinai /Horeb b y Sir William Petri e in 1904. Addition al under ground rooms, cham bers, te mples and hallways were discovered, some with vert ical circu lar stone support colu mns, and others with wall carv ings of delic ate figures of goddesses clothed in beau tiful apparel. Dr Seli m Hassan' s report described other m agnificen tly carved figures and ma ny beautifully coloured friez es. Photograph s were taken and one author and researcher who saw them, Rosicrucian H.

The intriguing question that arise s out of the discov ery is: where is that city toda y? Its secre t loca tion was recen tly revealed to a sele ct group of peopl e who were given perm ission to exp lore and film the ci ty. It exists in a huge natur al cavern s ystem below the Giza Plate au that extends out in an easterl y direct ion under Cairo. Its m ain entr y is from inside the Sphinx, with stairs cu t into rock that lead down to the cavern below the bedrock of the River Nile. The expedit ion carr ied down genera tors and infla table rafts and travelled along an under ground river that l ed to a lake one kilometre wide. O n the shores of the lake nestles the city, and per manent lighting is provided b y large crystalline balls set into the cavern walls and cei ling. A second entr y to the city is found in stairs le ading up to the base ment of the Coptic Church in old Cairo (Bab ylon). Drawing from narra- tives of people \"living in the Earth\" given in th e books of Genesis, J asher and Enoch, it is possible that th e city was original ly called Gigal.

OFFICIAL DENI ALS Because of Dr Seli m Hassan's exc avations and m odern space surveil lance techn iques, the records and tradi tions of the ancien t Egyptian mystery schools tha t claim to preserve secre t knowlege of the Giza Plateau all rose to the highest degre e of acc eptabi lity.

So persistent are their refutations th at the claims of m ystery schools were doubted b y the public and su spected of being fabrica ted in order to m ystify visitors to Egypt. The scholastic attitude is typified by a Harvard Universi ty publi c stat ement in 1972: No one should pay any atten tion to the preposter ous cla ims in regar d to the int erior of the Great Pyramid or the pre- sumed pas sageways and unex cavated temples and hal ls benea th the sand in the Pyramid district made by those who a re as locia ted wi th the so-called ,secr et cults or mystery socie ties of Egypt and the Orient.

EVER- BURNIN G LAMP S In spite of am azing discover ies, the stark truth is that th e earl y histor y of Eg ypt remains lar gely unknown and therefor e unmapp ed terr itory. It is not possible, th en, to sa y precisely how m iles of under ground passagewa ys and cha mbers benea th the Giza Plat eau were lit, but one thing is for s ure: unless the anc ients could see in th e dark, the vast subterran ean are as were som ehow illu minated. The same question is addressed of the inter ior of the Great Pyramid, and Eg yptologists have agreed that flaming torch es were not used, for cei lings had not been bla ck- ened with residual smok e. From what is currentl y known abou t subsurfac e passagewa ys under the P yramid Plateau, it is po ssible to det ermine that there are at least three m iles of passagewa ys 10 to 12 store ys below ground l evel. Both the Book of the Dead and the Pyramid Texts ma ke striking refer ences to \"The Ligh t-makers\", and that extraor - dinar y descript ion m ay have referred to a bod y of peop le respon- sible for light ing the subterranean areas of the ir complexes. Iamblichus record ed a fascin ating account that was found on a very ancient Egyptian pap yrus held in a m osque in Cairo. It was part of a 100 BC stor y by an unknown author about a group of peopl e who gained entry to under ground cham bers around Giza for explor atory purposes. They describ ed the ir experi ence: We came to a chambe r. W hen we enter ed, it became auto- matica lly illumina ted by light from a tube be ing the height of one man's hand [ app rox. 6 inch es o r 15.24 cm ] and thin, standing vertica lly in the co rner .

In some chamber s the light tubes worked and in others they did not. W e br oke open one of the tubes and i t bled beads of silver - colour ed l iquid tha t ran fastly around the floor until they disappear ed betw een the cracks (mer cury?) As time went on, th e ligh t tubes gradu- all y began to fail and the priests r emoved them and sto red them in an unde rground vaul t the y special ly bui lt southeast of the plat eau. It wa s the ir belie f that the light tubes we re cr eated by their be loved Imhotep, who would some day r eturn to make th em wo rk once again. It was common pract ice among ear ly Egyptians to seal light ed lamps in the sepulchr es of their dead as of ferings to their god or for the deceased to find the ir way to the \"other side\". Among the tombs near Me mphis (and in the Brahm in temples of Indi a), ligh ts were found oper - ating in sealed cha mbers and vessels, but sudden exposure to air ext inguished th em or caused their fuel to evaporate.(6) Greeks and Ro mans later followed the custo m, and the trad ition beca me gener ally estab lished-not only that of actu al burning lamps, but minia- ture reproduct ions ma de in terraco tta were buried with the dead. Some lamps were enc losed in c ircular vessels for protect ion, and instan ces are recorded where th e origina l oil was found perfectl y preserved in the m after more than 2,000 y ears. There is am ple proof fro m eyewitnesses that lamps were burning when the sepul- chres were sealed, and it was declar ed by later bystanders that they were stil l burning when the vaults were opened hundreds of years later. The possibility of preparing a fuel th at would renew itself as rapid ly as it was consu med was a source of considerabl e contro- versy among mediaeval authors, and nu merous docum ents exist outlining their arguments. After due considera tion of evidence at hand, it see med well within the range of possibili ty that ancient Egyptian priest-che mists manufa ctured lamps tha t burned if not indef initely then at least for consider able periods of ti me.

While conclusions reached by differen t authors are at a varianc e, a m ajority admitted the existence of the pheno menal lamps. Onl y a few m aintained th at the lamps would burn foreve r, but m any were will ing to concede that they might remain aligh t for several centur ies without replenishm ent of fuel. It was genera lly believ ed that the wick s of those perpetua l lamps were m ade of braided or w oven asbe stos, ca lled by early alchemists \"salamand er's wool\". The fuel appe ared to have been one of the products of al chemical research, possibly produced in the temple on Mt Sina i. Several form ulae for m aking fuel for the lamps were preserved, and in H. P . Blava tsky's profound work, Isis Unveil ed, the author repr inted two com plicated form ulae from earlier authors of a fuel that \"when made and lighted, will burn with a perpetua l flame and you may set this la mp in an y place where y ou please \". Some believ e the fabled perpe tual lamps of temples to be cunning mechanical con- trivances, and some quite hum orous explana- tions have been extended. In Eg ypt, rich under ground deposits of asphal t and petro leum exist, and some would have it that priests connected asbestos wicks by a secret duct to an oi l deposit, which in turn conne cted to one or m ore lamps. Others thought that the be lief that lamps burned indef initely in tombs was the result of the fac t that in some cases fum es rese mbling smoke poured forth from the entranc es of newl y opened vaults.

A 17th- centur y account recorded anoth er stor y about a robot. In cen tral England, a curious to mb was found cont aining an automaton that moved when an in truder stepped upon certa in stones in the floor of th e vault. At tha t time, the Rosicruci an con- trovers y was at its height, so it was decided that the to mb was that of a Rosicrucian initiate. A countr yman discover ed the tomb, entered and found the int erior bri lliantly lit by a lamp hanging from the ce iling. As he walked toward th e ligh t, his weight depressed the floor stones and, a t once, a seated figure in heav y armour began to move. Mechan ically it rose to its fee t and struck the lamp with an iron baton, destro ying it and thus ef fectively pre- venting the discover y of the secret substanc e that maintained the flame. How long the lamp had burned was unkno wn, but the report said tha t it had been for a considerabl e number of years."}]
