I.N.R.I. AT first sight it may appear to the casual reader of this essay, that the superscription on its cover is both frowar d and perverse, and contrary to the sum of human experience. This however I trust he will find is not the case, and, as Ianthe, will discover that after the mystic union has been consummated, the beautiful daughter of Ligdus and Telethusa was as acceptable a young husband as ever w ooed nymph on the shaded slopes of Ida. Much has been written concerning stars, both terrestrial and celestial, and not a little regarding that capricious star which gleamed over the humble manger-bed of the Son of Man. Dark seas of blood have long since lappe d that star of the morning into the crimson oblivion of day, whose empurpled strife has also rumbled into the distance as the droning of some drowsy fire-finger on the sleeping parchment of life, murmuring and mo aning as the wind-kissed mouth of a dreamy drum. Yet why should we still lis ten for those subtle sounds which have wearily danced out their slow saraband of sorrow. Once Orphic they arose emparadising the cavernous depths of Hell, to sink into a dirge-like Niobe death-chaunt, bewailing the thirt een children of their begetting, rising once more in the song of Ligeia, entic ing men to her mire, and at length to die still-voiced as the daughter of Di s, whose ghostly fingers sinking clutch the frozen reeds of that slough in which she had so long wallowed. Long have we peered, crouching on the watch-tower of our minds, through the darkness of ignorance lit alone by the northern lights of folly, till our"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"scorched eyes falling as slags upon our hearts, a light celestial hath arisen from out the eyeless sockets of Eternity . A day-star, to flash forth into the west, winged and wonderful. A Pharos of gleaming hope lighting our way across the boisterous ocean of life to our haven of eternal rest. The fools and the faulty, the wise a nd the wizened read and tremble before the might of its majesty, for into its flaming horrent hath it woven and braided the ashen locks of wisdom, the dyed curls of folly, and all the glittering circlets of golden youth. All is transcended, all is unified and transcendental; neither is there joy nor laughter, sorrow nor weeping, for all is as a divine mastery of Truth a nd Knowledge to those who worship the new-born God, like the Magi of the Ea st, with gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. Above whose heptagonal cradle flashes the magic star Lusanaher, that great star Cor Leonis, which herald s and directs our reverent pilgrimage. The Star has arisen; let us like men drop the silly pretence of an ostrich-like self-delusion that the cindery asteroid still lights our way; let us rather apply our mental spectroscope to the analysis of its rays. There shall we perchance discover the blending of all opposites in one harmonious light; thence shall we travel to the holy and humble hous e of the heart, wherein our God is born, whose name is ineffable, a Crow n of Glory, exalte d forever above the Balance of Righteousness and Truth. T.A.R.O. As author of the following essay to you my readers, I can but say with the four beasts of the Apocalypse: “Come and See.” “Behold the Lion... hath prevailed to open the Book and to loose the seven seals thereof.” For until now “No man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the Book, neither to look thereon.” Yet through the astrolabe of his mind and in the al embic of his heart Aleister Crowley has opened the book, breaking not only the first six seals, but the seventh also. For those who read and understand, the heavens shall depart as a scroll, and the stars shall fall, and the mountai ns be moved out of their places; and they shall become as kings in a new kingdom, and be crowned with that Crown which passes Understanding."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I have attempted in the following seven chapters to interpret the Book of the Seven Seals, and to pain t its splendour, as an artist would incarnadine his canvas with the red blood of his mistre ss, love-kissed from the bloom of her crimson lips. I have not, as Samuel, hacked and hewn Agag into pieces before the Lord in Gilgal; but ra ther Elijah-like have called upon Wisdom and Understanding so that my sacrifice, and even the wood and stone of the altar, and the water whic h floweth about it, may be licked up by the fire of the great Coronation. As another Ariadne I here offer this wo rk to my readers as a twisted clue of silk and hemp to guide them safely through the labyrinthine mysteries of poetry and magic, whose taurine crag s hug the blue sky, amorous as the kisses of Pasiphae; across the Elysian fields of myrtle and asphodel, up the eagle-crested slopes of Olympus, and ove r the shining sun-scorched sands of Ammon, tawny and silken as the crouc hing form of some colossal lion, to the cool groves of Eleusis child-like dreaming in the bosom of silvery Attica by the blue Ægean sea. Yet those who would drink deeper of the wine of this magical Eucharist, spilt with due reverence on the pages of th is volume, they must seek it in the Sibylline verses of those books from wh ich this one has drawn its life-blood. And they are: Aceldama. The Tale of Archais. Songs of the Spirit. Jezebel. An Appeal to the American People. Jephthah. The Mother’s Tragedy. The Soul of Osiris. Carmen Saeculare. Tannhäuser.

My faults are more numerous than I care to think of; yet it is without fear or trepidation that I offer this essay to the public. It has been a difficult task. In simple words and complex symbols Crowley has written with St. Leo— “Know, O man, thy dignity;” and this I have in this essay attempted to explain, though many I am afraid w ill misunderstand me, and more still misinterpret my modest efforts. Fo r these latter ones I can but exclaim: “Caeterum scis quid ego cogitem, scor tum scorteum; Di tibi dent, nudosque lares inopemque senectam et l ongas hyemes perpetuam que sitim.” And for those former, bid them contemplate well the words of St. Augustine: “Such as the love of man is, such is he himself. Dost thou love the earth? Thou art earth. Dost thou love God? What shall I say? Thou art God.” J.F.C.F."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"FOREWORD IN “Frazer’s Magazine” of Novemb er, 1866, may be found the following: “Wherever there is any kind of true genius, we have no right to drive it mad by ridicule or invective; we must deal with it wisely, justly, fairly. Some of these passages which have been selected as evidence of (the poet’s) plain speaking, have been wantonly misunde rstood. The volume, as a whole, is neither profane nor indecen t. A little more clothing in our uncertain climate might perhaps have been attended with advantage... To us this volume, for the first time, conclusively settles that Mr.— is not a mere brilliant rhetorician or melodious twanger of another man’s lyre, but authentically a poet.” So writes the critic. The name I have om itted is that of the last of the great Victorian poets, Algernon Charles Swinbur ne. In the dying glory of this last great singer of the nineteenth century, the deepening twilight shows but few rising stars; alone perhaps amid th e younger generation of poets – alas, how many and yet how few – Aleister Crowle y stands forth with no little of the glory of the great Victorian cast o’er him; enhancing our pleasures, and enchanting our senses. The Sun ki sses the Moon, and through the diaphanous veil of the vestal is seen the subtle contour of her form. But no vestal is Crowley, no mere milk-and- bun-walk, where we may rest and take our fill; for he has unstrung the mystic lyre of life from the tree of the Knowledge of Good and of Evil, singing old songs and new, flinging shrill notes of satire to this tumultuous world, as some stormy petrel shrilly crying to the storm; or sweet notes of love , soft as the whispering wings of a butterfly. Here are the jewels of Heaven, of Ha vilah, and of Eden, with not a little of the fire of Hell, the flames of Gehe nna, and the darkness of Dûat. If we look for pyramids and colossi disappointmen t will be our lot; we cannot hold, as Hanuman of Ind, a mountain in one ha nd and a forest in the other, neither can we gaze on a celestia l Meru or Olympus; but as we look, and here it is only the searcher who is rewarded, we find a little jewel, then another, and still another, till, as we grasp them, their very light is caught by their"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"unfound fellows, and our path is lit as a fairy dell by a thousand wonders of light and of beauty. “A little more clothing,” the critic write s, as he perused the “Poems and Ballads,” perhaps, yet we do not feel its need in the glowing works before us. Forty long years have passed, and the world move s. Crowley fairly puts his characters to bed, tucks them up, and does not blow the candle out with cryptic Morse-like dot and dash, leavi ng the imagination to wallow in the dark, intelligible to the baby-mind of sucklings, and we admire him all the more for not doing so; his undraped vi rginity is delightful, and if his maidens lack vestments and his matrons mantles, it is a hearty sight, a robust sight, it flushes the drains of our mind, and discloses a heart lying beneath all the conventional tweeds and silks of our sleek resp ectability. The stale odour of Mrs. Grundy’s petticoats vanish es, neither is it replaced by the patchouli of Thais, nor the musk of Aspasia; and if the aroma of a little human sweat does salute our nostrils, it is at least a healthy human smell – an odour of sanctity – infinitely prefer able to all the ancient pot-pourri of Philistia, that young and old ladies ar e alike so fond of distributing among their pretty speeches, as well as their pretty garments. “Is life, then, to resolve itself for us into a chain of exhilarating pangs?” asked Pallas, in Mr. Gosse’s “Hypolym pia,” in answer to the query of Æsculapius, “What is pleasure?” We se e the mortal form of the immortal healer climbing along the jutting cornice of some cliff, in search for the simples of life; and as the zephyrs waft his long ashen locks around his furrowed brow, his trembling hand clut ches some rugged crag, more perhaps from joy than fear. And so, as we now open the works of Aleister Crowley, we are filled with an exhilarating chai n of pangs; mortal-like we are never sated, and as our lips taste the nectar of true poetry we tremblingly clutch the crags of Parnassus in search for th e Asphodel of Love, Wisdom, and Beauty. Here, as we turn some beetling height , the dying rays of the Swinburnian sun sink, those rays that ruffled the vestal purity of the clouds to the rosy blush of a lover’s kiss, and in the departi ng light we again find the mystic Trinity midst the hellebore and thistles of exis tence, enthroned, eternal. The sun sinks, and the last notes of the nighti ngale die into the stillness of falling night. The emerald sky like the robe of some car-borne Astarté, slashed with an infinite orange and red, fades into the sombre garment of night; and above silently breaks a primal sea ge mmed with all the colours of the opal, deepening into a limitless amethyst, darkens, and the sun goes out.

Pregnant it certainly is, a nd more, being already the mother of a large family, a family as diverse as th e offspring of Uranus, father of the Gods, born to him by Earth, earthy and celestial. Sweet lyrics are crushed cheek by jowl with the most corrosive satire, sonorous heroics and blank verse at times merge into the most ra ucous of Hudibrasia n doggerel, rimes of the sweetest and the most perverse character ring in our astonished ear, tragedy and farce, ever extremes: Paul and Virginie sitting on the knees of Pantagruel, blowing kisses through the Se phirotic circle of eternity. At times we listen to the yearning hopes of a Paracelsus, or the noble words of a Tannhäuser; at times warm arms are flung around us, and the hot kisses of some Messaline suffocate our very breath, leading us into the mansions of a de Sade and through the gardens of an Aretino, horrid with the frenzy of Eros. Or, again, we are treading with th e sages of philosophy, or ‘midst the stars in search of the Psyche of ev ents; dreams almost monstrous in their intensity seize our troubled brain, d eep problems of psychology, of sex, of the carnal, of the pathic, and of evil, all inter-webbed a nd woven with the eternal filament of good. And so if we read this strange poet aright, we shall see as we progress onwards, that he ha s struck a sonorous note from the rim of Time, fulfilled of the knowledge of good and evil, sweet to the ears of those who are born children by the daught ers of men to the sons of God, sweet as that mystic fruit was to the lips of Eve, daughter of God, child of the mystic Man. But we must speed on, taking in this chapter swift glances at the magnificent scenery that these volumes offer up to us, plucking the lilies of spring and the roses of summ er, and weave them into a laureate wreath with the fiery leaves of the dying year. *The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 166."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Poe, in that little masterpiece of his, “The Poetic Princip le,” lays down that the value of a poem lies in the ratio of its elevating excitement, the excitement being the power it has in el evating the soul. And here we think, were Poe still living, he would have found no small part of his ideal realized. By soul we naturally do not mean a haloed fowl strumming dithyrambs on a harp, or the mere döppelganger of the living; but that inner power of good and evil which lies latent in self, c ontrolled by that intuitive consciousness within us, and manifested in our appe tites and desires; this intangible soul aspiring upwards is called Virtue, sinking downwards Vice; finding infinity in the conceptions of nether and uppe r, heaven and hell, paradise and gehenna; and finality on earth – its spor ting ground. Further Poe states: that an epic was of itself a nullity, and th at a poem of great length, commencing as it might in exaltation, ended in ni ne cases out of ten in somnolence. Poetry must stimulate, it must irritate the soul in some definite manner, or else it ceases to be poetry. For when once poetry exerts a soporific power its whole object is lost, and, as a flash of lightning, it must he vivid, bright, flaming for a moment, awful, eloquent, rushing from the darkness of night through the flashing elements of day into the silence of eternity. And this is exactly the poetry we he re find. No poems are of any great length, no poems here contain a labour on th e part of the reader to attain the end,* though in some places the labour s of Hercules seem insignificant compared with the labours of mental unknotting, but even in such places (where the sense becomes tangled in th e reader’s mind)’ he loses none of the beauty of rime and rhythm , he never becomes bored, never weary. Set in the pure gold of verse and line, lie lyrics of surpassing beauty: Tannhäuser (the longest of the poems) would be a magni ficent contemplation even if we cut from it its sparkling songs, but with them it becomes superb, neither are there too many; the queen of our poe t’s ideals is no gilded prostitute, no Theodora hung with a myriad flashing jewels, but rather some chaste priestess carrying on her breast the mys tic symbol of Isis, whose belt is a jewelled Zodiac, and in whos e hand is the eternal Ankh. *Except perhaps in Orpheus. This interspersing of lyrics has b een carried to a charming intensity of expression and their effect on the mi nd is one full of joy, no cloying, no surfeit, no repletion; the variety of the dishes is extraordinary in delicacy and piquancy as well as in number."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The morals of a nation can with fair accuracy be gauged from the condition of its arts and literature, and in what a state are our s? Our music the jangling ditties of the streets, our paintings, posters and bedizened Jewesses; and our literature, heroically vulgar, vulga rly obscene, and obscenely insipid. Morals, the nation has none, me rely a better art in di sguising than in former times, that is all. We no longer can produce a Swift, a Congreve, or a Dryden, a Smollett, a Lever, or a Sterne, and yet our writers are legion – and as feculent as the flabby prostitutes of the street. The facetiae of the fifteenth century, “Les Cent Nouvelles Nouve lles,” “The Decameron,” “The Heptameron,” “The Nights of Straparo la,” “Brantôme,” etc., etc., are not only masterpieces for all time, but are pure, even chaste, compared with the virginal lusts that are becoming so fashionable in our modern literature, whose maidens are Lesbians, and whos e heroes are satyrs. Europa is no longer satisfied with her bull, but s eeks an ichor-madde ned elephant; Leda disdains her swan, and burns for a stra ddling ostrich; the goat of lechery sits enthroned o’er us, and is fast coup ling with the mind of the nation, and spawning offspring effeminate, lustful, and degenerate. Tribades with their evil-smelling kisses swarm over our page s, heroines are no longer satisfied with mere men, but must strain to their breasts legless monsters; whilst a hero will listen to his loved one snor ting in the arms of some lusty P ă th ā n. Such literature is revolting, not in its mere descriptions, for these are nothing to the student, being generally but poor ly described realities, but they are horrible when strewn broadcast among the children of the nation. We still have our Bible and need no more eroti ca. Filth has been defined as matter out of place, and so is this pathic litera ture, relegated to the realms of sexual psychology in the works of an Ellis or an Ebing is one thing, yet the government of this nation cannot stomac h them thus, and seizes, expels, and burns; but if these horrid sores of the human soul are cut out and plastered on the pages of the fickle fiction of th e day, then are they passed in seductive covers as proper nourishment for the nation; and devoured with relish and avidity. One minute, impatient reader, for I hear you mutter: “Are not these very aberrations set forth with no mean lustre on the pages of the works of Aleister Crowley?” Listen. Have a ny of Crowley’s works been printed pueris virginibusque ? Are they intended for the gaping public? Are they devoured by mental babes and sucklings , or worse, forcibly crammed down their throats in simple or other forms? I think not. To some it may seem curious that these poems are published by a society called “The Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth.” By whom is the Bible published? Is it not also a religious society, and is the Bible immaculate? Was it not Sir"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Richard Burton, the greatest of Orienta lists, who resolved in case the rabid pornophobic suggestions of certain orna ments of the home press were acted upon, to appear in court with the Bi ble and Shakespeare under one arm, and Petronius Arbiter and Rabelais under th e other? And I remember a certain sentence – characteristic of the man – he was describing those people who are unable to read crude texts, arid needs must have them bowdlerized and expurgated, lest they fall into a pria pic frenzy: “The ma n must be prurient and lecherous as a dog-faced baboon in ru t to have aught of passion excited by either.” This is all true enough; but I must call a halt. I had not in tended here to write a series of apologetics, for I leave that to the poet and his pen, who can well look after themselves; but what I wish ed to point out was the deplorable state into which our literature has fa llen. Its ever increasing demand for sensation has been its destruction; everyone now is a mental Trimalchio whose appetite has to be awakened by the most piquant and fantastic of dishes. Scott, Dickens, and Thackera y are still (I believe) read by an ever decreasing number of school-girls; Fl aubert, Gautier and Balzac – who would have shocked the youthful years of our parents – have become dull and tedious; a few cranks praise Tour genief, Tolstoi and Gorky, whilst one out of every hundred thousand may know that there wa s such a man as Dostoieffsky. And poetry, O greatest of the Muses, thy fate is truly a sad one! Much verse is produced which might be placed with last year’s store lists – you know where; some is distin ctly good, but it is soon lost in the raging sea of poetic di alect, and hackneyed naïveté . Here and there we come across a charming lyric, which the ca rping whisky-and-water critic will at once demolish as weak, troubled, vague, etc., etc. Not l ong ago my eyes lit on the following which I considered a charming verse from a poetic point of view, if not from that of a morbid anatomist: Look down into the river. Can you see The mingled images the water shows? So lies my soul in you rs. As close as lie The folded petals in an unblown rose. Yet the little thing who “stinks and s tings” was not satisfied, the second metaphor actually weakened the effect of the first, etc., etc. With such have poets to contend, but I do not think such homunculi worry Aleister Crowley much. His poetry is his own, and he gives it us as it is written without"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"respect of persons or opinions, for hi s masters have been the greatest of our race. In these poems we find a certain preponderance of Swinburne, Blake, Browning, Keats, Shelley, and Rossetti. In the dedication to “Jephthah,” which is addressed to Algernon Charle s Swinburne, we read the following: As streams get water of the sun-smit sea, Seeking my ocean and my sun in thee.* *Jephthah, vol. i, p. 66. And this discipleship to the greatest a nd last of the Victorian poets has given us many a subtle and enthralling line. The scene when Charicles wakes and catches Archais to his breast is wort hy of the bard who sang of “Tristram and Iseult.” It is as follows: He sprang, he caught her to his breast; the maid Smiled and lay back to look at him. He laid Her tender body on the sloping field, And felt her sighs in his embraces yield A sweeter music than all birds. But she, Lost in the love she might not know, may see No further than his face, and yet, aware Of her own fate, resisted like a snare. Her own soft wishes. As she looked and saw His eager face, the iron rod of law Grew like a misty pillar in the sky. In all her veins the blood’s desires die, And then – O sudden ardour! – all her mind And memory faded, and looked outward, blind, Beyond their bitterness. Her arms she flung Around him, and with amorous lips and tongue Tortured his palate with extreme desire, And like a Mænad madde ned; equal fire Leapt in his veins; locked close for love they lie, The heart’s dumb word exprest without a sigh In the strong magic of a lover’s kiss.* *The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 11."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"These superb lines, like those of Swinbur ne, are in reality a series of brilliant lyrical illustrations depicting the story in measures of divine song. More we find in this same poem, and in others also; the following fine sonnet entitled “The Summit of the Amorous Mountain,” is distinctly Swinburnian; I give it in its entirety: To love you, Love, is all my happiness; To kill you with my kisses; to devour Your whole ripe beauty in the perfect hour That mingles us in one supreme caress; To drink the purple of your thighs; to press Your beating bosom like a living flower; To die in your embraces, in the shower That dews like death your swooning loveliness. To know you love me; that your body leaps With the quick passion of your soul; to know Your fragrant kisses sting my spirit so; To be one soul where Satan smiles and sleeps— Ah! in the very triumph-hour of Hell Satan himself remembers whence he fell!* *The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 181. Again, such lines as these from the “Triumph of Man”: And all the earth is blasted; the green sward Burns where it touches, and the barren sod Rejects the poison of the blood of God. . . . . . . . . . . . . . To tread base thoughts as our high thoughts have trod, Deep in the dust, the carrion that was God;* *Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, pp. 106, 107. remind us strongly of such pieces as “Before a Crucifix,” whilst others take us into the mystic and simple land of Blake, such as the duet of Charicles and Archais:"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Hush! the music swells apace, Rolls its silver billows up Through the void demesne of space To the heavens’ azure cup! Hush, my love, and sleep shall sigh This is immortality!* *The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 27. Other lines again hold us enthralled with the extraordinary power they contain, expressed in a single word. Thus in the poem “The Lesbian Hell,” we find ourselves in the unutterable voi d of Orcus, where kisses are flung in vain, and where around us pale women fleet: Whose empty fruitlessness assails the night With hollow repercussion, like dim tombs Wherein some vampire glooms.* *The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 185. This last line is one of the most e xpressive ever written by Crowley, and in the last word “glooms” is concentrat ed more than terror or fear, a brooding unnameable horror, comparable to the word “crowd” that Blake makes use of in his “Mad Song”: Like a fiend in a cloud. With howling woe After night I do crowd And with night will go. Both poets have chosen here not the onl y word that could be chosen, but the only word that would in the above poems express the maximum amount, of horror in the one case; and of desire in the other. Very different from Blake do we find such a poem as “Vespers,” which, though differing in rime, in cadence a nd spirit; is reminiscent of Rossetti’s “Blessed Damozel”: Still in those avenues of light, No maid, with golden zone,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"And lily garment that from sight Half hides the ivory throne, Lay in my arms the livelong night To call my soul her own.* * Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 53. Whilst parts of the poem “Messaline” with which “Alice” opens remind us of poor “Jenny.” Tennyson, if we are to judge from th e introduction to “Alice,” does not seem to hold a very high position in the opini on of Aleister Crowley. “He is a neurasthenic counter-jumper” certainly would not have pleased Poe, who regarded him as the noblest poet that ever lived. Nevertheless we find traces of the great laureate’s work in these poe ms, such as the idea contained in the following verse of “De Profundis”: I have dreamed life a circle or a line, Called God, and Fa te, and Chance, and Man, divine. I know not all I say, but through it all Mark the dim hint of ultimate sunshine!* *Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 113. which is almost identical with that in Canto LIV of “In Memoriam.” A poem written in the metre of Tennyson’s mo st famous work, yet differing in cadence, is “The Blood Lotus.” Quaint carven vampire bats, unseen in curious hollows of the trees, Or deadlier serpents coiled at ease round carcases of birds unclean; All wandering changeful spectre shapes that dance in slow sweet measure round And merge themselves in th e profound, nude women and distorted apes Grotesque and hairy, in their rage more rampant than the stallion steed;"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"There is no help: their horrid need on these pale women they assuage.* *Oracles, vol. ii, p. 13. Another poem that in parts reminds us of the “In Memoriam” is “The Nameless Quest,” such lines as: I was wed Unto the part, and could not grasp the whole.* *The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 191. breathe a great and similar doubt. As in many respects the agnosticism of Tennyson’s “In Memoriam” resemble s the atheistic free thought of FitzGerald’s “Omar Khayyám,” so do both the above-mentioned poems, and the first is of similar metre, its quatr ains containing, as those of the poet of Khorassán, flights of great power of thought; the following five quatrains are well worth quoting: We weep them as they slip away; we gaze Back on the likeness of the former days— The hair we fondle and the lips we kiss— Roses grow yellow and no purple stays. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Before we leave the glowing east, one mo re curious similarity still strikes us, it is that though in so many ways the ideas of Aleister Crowley are akin to those of Omar Khayyám, yet his fertile imagination also engenders flights as spiritual as those contained in the me lodious ghazals of Jeláladdín. In more than one place we come across lines similar to these in Tannhäuser: I say, then, “I;” and yet it is not “I” Distinct, but “I” incorporate in All. I am the Resurrection and the Life! The work is finished, a nd the Night rolled back! I am the rising Sun of Life and Light, The Glory of the Shining of the Dawn! I am Osiris! I the Lord of Life Triumphant over death— O Sorrow, Sorrow, Sorrow of the World!* *Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 261. That such similarities as we have poi nted out above show Aleister Crowley to be a copyist, must be far from the minds of all his readers. Youth most certainly tends towards certain ideals, and frequently results in a definite hero-worship; but genius cannot be bound for long; it will eventually find its"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"own level. The mere fact that cer tain forms of thought and modes of expression occur here as they have occurred elsewhere, should he as a literary barometer, enabling us to judge the mental standard of the writer. All great writers will have many points in co mmon. It is more than probable that Aleister Crowley had already read mo st of Shakespeare before he wrote “The Mother’s Tragedy,” and yet, becau se of this we should not necessarily say that the following magnificent lines were due to the influence of the great master, notwithstanding the fact th at they are in many respects equal to much of his best: Your breath, that burns upon me, wraps me round With whirling passion, pierces through my veins With its unhallowed fire, constrains, compels, Drags out the corpse of twenty years ago From the untrusty coffin of my mind, To poison, to corrupt, to strike you there Blind with its horror.* *The Mother’s Tragedy, vol. i, p. 160.

In “The Violet’s Love Story,”*1. or in “Dora,”*2. we have as simple a poem as could be written, and in one of th e verses of a chorus in “Jephthah,” beginning “There flashes the heart of a rose,”*3. one of the most mystical. Here is a furious inspiration in bl ank verse (the prophet in “Jephthah” speaks): *1. Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 38. *2. Rosa Mundi and other Love Songs, vol. iii, p. 59. *3. Jephthah, vol. i, p. 77."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Ha! The rose has washed its petals, and the blood Pours through its burning centre from my heart.

Little, if any, poetry of a truly epic na ture can we find; the nearest is the song of Tannhäuser, somewhat of a prophecy, somewhat of an anthem: I rose within the elemental ball, And lo! the Ancient One of Days did sit! His head and hair were white as wool. His eyes A flaming fire: and from the splendid mouth Flashed the Eternal Sword! Lo!

Worthy of the author of “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell!” “Let there be Life and Death,” and th e link between these two is Love. Here we will give but one or two curious examples, dealing with the great songs of love in the next chapter. As a singer of love-songs Aleister Crowley excels. The following is from “The Star and the Garter”: Your lips are gathered up to mine; Your bosom heaves with fearful breath; Your scent is keen as floral wine, Inviting me, and love, to death.* *The Star and the Garter, vol. iii, p. 11. Also the following is charming in its simplicity: She has a lithe white body, slim And limber, fairy-like, a snake Hissing some Babylonian hymn Tangled in the Assyrian brake.* *The Star and the Garter, vol. iii, p. 10. A curious Swinburnian strain of passion is found wedged in the satiric lines of “Why Jesus Wept.” Percy, the youth flatulent with love, chants to his Angela – society – thus: To me she is The rosy incarnation of a kiss, The royal rapture of a young delight, The mazy music of virginity, Sun of the day, moon of the night,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"All, all to me!* *Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 39. And again: Love, love, these raptures are like springtide rain Nestling among green leaves.* *Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 40. One more example of the diversity of Crowley’s pen, before we deal with his place in the history of poetry. In the “God-Eater” we come across a most weird form of poetic imagination in the chants of Rupha – the hag of Eternity: Crafty! Crafty! That is the omen. Fear not the foemen! [She rises up. Mine is the spoil Of the grimly toil. Gloomy, gloomy! Ah! but I laugh. He is but a fool. He has lost! He is lost! Take the staff! Trace the rule Of the circle crossed!* *The God-Eater, vol. ii, p. 135. We have now seen, more or less, some of the chief influences which have exerted their sway over our poet’s mind; and I think we have shown him to be a worthy pupil of the great masters we have had occasion to name. Now that I have pointed out these certain influences, illustrating them by means of a few quotations, I intend to enter more into the history of his poetry and also the place it fills in the history of English poetry generally. This is not altogether an easy matter. Firstly, in selecting distinctive specimens it is difficult not to help being guided by i ndividual taste; secondly, the labour of"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"sorting the finest out of the fine is a work which needs no small powers of application; and thirdly, how often ma y not the individual selector be wrong in his choice? But this latter difficulty is easily overcome by the reader, who has only to pick and choose for himself; the work of an appreciative essayist being merely that of producing a characte ristic display of what he considers the most attractive wares. It is not intended here in any way to assume immaculacy for our author, far from it, for faults are to be found here as in every other work, great or small, false rime and metre, half a step left out here and there, sometimes a whole one : but taking these poems as a whole, these lapses are remarkably few, and it must also be borne in mind that in nearly every case they are intenti onal lapses from the orthodox rules of poetic cadence and metre. One command Crowley alone obeys, and that is: that all verse – rime, rhythm, and metr e – to be considered as poetry, must be musical.* Without music there can be no poetry, at best but a kind of poetic prose as found in the Prophetic B ooks of Blake, and in the works of Walt Whitman. Yet in Blake, I th ink, we do find many consistent irregularities, which have been en tirely misunderstood by many of his editors and critics. However, it was not till Swinburne loomed athwart the conscious regularity of the Tennysonian era, a poetic pre-Raphaelite, that, strictly speaking, a conscious and mu sical irregularity became admissible, wedging its way in, and splitting up th e metrical structure of perfect scansion. *As a good example I will quote the following opening lines of a sonnet addressed to “the Secretary of State,” by Wilson B onchord in Poems composed in Prison: When Crime’s sad victim has been tried and brought Within the circle of the difficult sphere Which England’s penal statutes appoint him here: To expiate by patient toil and thought. Neither the second nor the third line scan s; nevertheless the second is good, as it is musical: the extra half-step in the word “di fficult” carrying with it a difficulty, and thus emphasizing the meaning; whilst in the th ird, there is neither scansion nor music. In “Atalanta in Calydon” we find a fu rther breaking away from the dramatic formalities inaugurated during the post-re storation era: Swinburne seeking a more perfect model in the old Traged ies of Greece. This had already been partially carried out by Keats, who de finitely broke away from the Miltonic style of Wordsworth and Coleridge, a nd was more than half completed by his contemporary, Shelley. But it was not till Swinburne himself seized the finely-strung lyre of the unconsciousl y irregular author of “Prometheus,” and attuned it to the rustle of Blake’ s angel-winged voice, that it can be said"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"that a certain system of irregularitie s in metre became admissible in the formal court of poetry. As the Rossetti brotherhood of painters returned to the stiff and simple elegance as displayed in the “Primave ra” of Botticelli, so did Swinburne go back to the simple beauty of Greek tragedy as depicted in Euripides.* Crowley does the same, as we see in “The Tale of Archais,” also in “The Mother’s Tragedy” and “The Fatal Fo rce”; but in these two latter dramas with this important difference, that in stead of applying Greek style to Greek scenery, he applies it to a totally diffe rent end, namely to the expression of modern surroundings, or to his own intrinsic ideas, as in the last-named play, which, even more so than in “The Moth er’s Tragedy” is, as we shall see later on, a subtle discount on present-day morality. *Rather than Sophocles or Aeschylus. What Beardsley and Whistler did for art, Crowley is now doing for poetry. Beardsley, especially, succeede d Rossetti just as Crowley is now superseding Swinburne. A poetic iconoclast to the very backbone, we find Crowley, especially in his later works, breaking away from every poetic convention and restraint. At first it ma kes itself apparent in “The Star and the Garter,” which was unwound from th at same tangled skein from out of which Browning had ravelled “Fifine, ” and then, in the full power of manhood, in “Why Jesus Wept”; which one day will find its historic niche in the temple of Poetry, somewhere betw een the “Hudibras” of Butler and the “Endymion” of Keats. Though Crowley, as can be clearly seen throughout his works, is not only a great admirer but also a disciple of Browning’s, he nevertheless vigorously attacks that great master’s cacophony a nd wilful obscurity of meaning, in that eccentric curiosity of diction “T he Sword of Song,” in which our ears are assailed by the most monstrous dive rsity of noises, following in a rapid and dazzling succession till the ideas enge ndered in our brains are sporting in an outburst of mental l eap-frog. The following are a few: “Fleas kill us” with “Aeschylus” “Trough hock lees” “ “Sophocles” “Globule us” “ “Aristobulus”* *The Sword of Song, vol. ii, p. 145."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"And here is a good example: Let me help Babu Chander Grish up!

Such nonsense for sound truth you dish up, Were I magician, no mere cadi, Not Samuel’s ghost you’d make me wish up, Nor Saul’s (the mighty son of Kish) up, But Ingersoll’s or Bradlaugh’s, pardie! By spells and cauldron stews that squish up, Or purifying of the Nadi, Till Stradivarius or Amati Shriek in my stomach! Sarasate, Such strains! Such music as once Sadi Made Persia ring with! I who fish up No such from soul may yet cry: Vade Retro Satanas! Tom Bond Bishop!* *The Sword of Song, vol. ii, p. 148. Browni ng’s cacophony in “The Flight of the Duchess” is truly extraordinary: “Soul a stir up” with “streaky syrup” “Went trickle” “ “ventricle” “Sperm oil” “ “turmoil” “Wreathy hop” “ “Æthiop” “Matters equine” “ “French weak wine.” We have mentioned “Why Jesus Wept” as one of the most irregular of Crowley’s poems, yet its irregularities are regularly irregular throughout, bearing a similar relationship to a tr ue poem like “Rosa Mundi” that a comic song would to a great oratorio. “Why Je sus Wept” is a satir ic farce, “Rosa Mundi” a great love anthem, almost we might say a Wagnerian opera in rime, and comparable in many respects in its continuous though irregular symphony to the “Lycidas” of Milton. Yet, nevertheless, “Why Jesus Wept” is the more characteristic of the two, and certainly the most iconoclastic of any. In “Orpheus,” Books I a nd II, we find a poetic regularity almost strictly adhered to, not so, however, in Book III, and in “The Argonauts.” But it is"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"not till we get to “Rodin in Rime” that we find practically every sonnet and quatorzain possessing some infringement of the orthodox rules of poetry; yet it cannot be said that these poems, ch iefly in iambic verse broken by the occasional introduction of another foot, usually an anapaest, read unmusically on account of its presence. Take for instance: Cloistral seclusion of the galleried pines Is mine to-day: these groves are fit for Pan— O rich with Bacchic frenzy, and his wine’s Atonement for the infinite woe of man!* *W.E. Henley, Rodin in Rime, vol. iii, p. 119. Here “cloistral” is a spondee; “eried pines,” an (imperfect) anapaest; and so on. Again in “La Fortune”: “Hail, Tyche! From the Amalthean horn Pour forth the store of love! I lowly bend Before thee: I invoke thee at the end When other gods are fallen and put to scorn. Thy foot is to my lips; my sighs unborn Rise, touch and curl about thy heart; they spend Pitiful love. Lovelier pity, descend And bring me luck who am lonely and forlorn.”* *W.E. Henley, Rodin in Rime, vol. iii, p. 120. Compare the following verse in Swinburne’s poem, The Centenary of the Battle of the Nile: The strong and sunbright lie whose name was France Arose against the sun of truth, whose glance Laughed large from the eyes of England fierce as fire Whence eyes wax blind that gaze in truth askance. Here “piti” is a trochee; “lovelier,” a spondee; “pity,” a trochee. The whole metre breaks up, as if the singer’s heart burst in despair. Whilst in “Bouches d’Enfer” we find such lines as: From the long-held leash! The headlong, hot-mouthed girl,*"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"*Rodin in Rime, vol. iii, p. 119. in which, as we read, we feel a verita ble stretching of the mental leather, as it were; our minds being held back a space by the introduction of the word “long.” This quatorzain ends: Of smouldering infamy. Bow down in awe! It is enough. The Gods are at feast. Withdraw!* *Rodin in Rime, vol. iii, p. 119. Again the same mental stress. All the above are contrary to the rules of scansion, yet nevertheless they are musical. And though in “Rodin in Rime ” perhaps Crowley slightly overdoes this introduction of irregular lines, yet they add a great charm, as they do in many of his other poems, producing in their lingering pause or quick jump an ecstatic spasm, if we may so ca ll it, which renders so many of these poems unique. Such as in “Styx” we find: The fourth, to draw her kisses and to keep; The fifth, for love; the sixth, in sweet despair; The seventh, to destroy us unaware; The eighth, to dive with in the infernal deep.* *The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 183. “In” would scan better; but by replaci ng it by “within” we can feel the dark waters close over us as we are bor ne down their unfathomable depths. Similarly in the following: Aching with all the pangs of night My shuddering body swoons; my eyes Absorb her eyelids’ lazy light, And read her bosom...* *Jezebel, vol. i, p. 131."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The extra half-step in “shuddering” in place of discordantly jarring on the metre produces a keener sense of a gony in the reader’s mind than a word which scanned correctly would do. In the next passage, take n from “Tannhäuser,” we find the introduction of a spondee carrying with it a curious sensation of slowness: Chaos, a speck; and space, a span; Ruinous cycles fallen in, And Darkness on the Deep of Time. Murmurous voices call and climb; Faces, half -formed, arise; and He Looked from the shadow of His throne, The curtain of Eternity;* *Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 251. (The italics are mine.) whilst in the last verse of “The Pala ce of the World” the sudden dropping of a whole foot produces with it a sudden sense of finality: Thine be the kingdom! Thine the power! The glory triply thine! Thine, through Eternity’s swift hour, Eternity, thy shrine— Yea, by the holy lotus-flower, Even mine!* *The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 205. Further on in the same series of poems a sudden whirring sense of madness is produced by introducing the word “l unatic” into an otherwise regular line: Silence, deep silenc e. Not a shudder stirs The vast demesne of unforgetful space, No comet’s lunatic rush: no meteor whirs, No star dares breathe. . .* *The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 209.

I will not say that they are the only imperfections to be found throughout these works, but I will say that there are very few others. And considering that Aleister Crowley has written about one hundred thousand lines in the space of ten years, or half the quantity produced by Robert Browning in fifty- six, the fewness of imperfections in his work is truly remarkable. Let us now pass from what I may call the Poetic Iconomachy to the Poetic Iconolatry of these poems; from Aleister Crowley’s war against poetic form, to his adoration of poetic imagery; a nd then to the keynote of the whole of his poetry, and, as we sh all presently see, his philosophy as well, namely— Ecstasy. In “Gargoyles” we find several truly wonderful picture poems. Thus in “The White Cat”: Hail, sweet my sister! ha il, adulterous spouse, Gilded with passionate pomp, and gay with guilt: Rioting, rioting in the dreary house With blood and wine and roses splashed and spilt About thy dabbling feet, and aching jaws Whose tongue licks mine, twin asps like moons that curl, Red moons of blood! Whose catlike body claws, Like a white swan raping a jet-black girl, Mine, with hysteric laughter...* *Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 86."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"And the following four verses in “Saida” are superb: The spears of the night at her onset Are lords of the day for a while, The magical green of the sunset, The magical blue of the Nile.

We have swooned through the midday exhausted By the lips – they are whips – of the sun, The horizon befogged and befrosted By the haze and the grays and the dun Of the whirlings of sand Let loose on the land By the wind that is born of the sun. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

This one astonishing verse upsets the equilibrium of the whole poem, as it would of any poem; for if the remain ing thirteen had been penned in an equivalent vividness of colouring, the effect would have been one of complete overpowerment rather th an of a sudden and dizzy joy. As the aristocratic virtues of one centu ry become the democratic vices of the next, so do the noble renderings of one age of literature become the hackneyed phraseology of the following, this being true whether we are speaking of poetry or prose. Vet one a ttribute alone remains ever youthful as the ages roll by into the aeons, and th at is— Ecstasy; whether we find it in the rapture of Love, the melody of Song, or the fire of Deity, it is what Poe meant by “elevating excitement,” and as we have seen, it was because of its absence that he attacked the Epic school of verse. Ecstasy lies beyond our gnosis; as we sha ll hereafter see, it carries us out of ourselves, beyond the mere shell of existe nce, into the very depths of the profound. For the fraction of a sec ond the whole ocean of our being is whirled through a narrow gorge, then on ce again we are hurled forth into the eddying cataracts of life, an essentia l spirit light gilding once again the sepulchral abode of a corpse. For a mome nt we behold God, face to face, but for a moment only, then all again is ni ght. Keats attained, and so did Shelley and Browning. Read the last verses of the “Prometheus Unbound” and “A Grammarian’s Funeral,” and all will be plain; and it is this same ecstasy that burns white in these two superb poems, which flames a bright star of beauty guiding us on our long journey across the hundred thousand leagues of the empire of Crowley’s pen. We find it shining brightly over almost every page, a fact which renders the task of quoting nigh endless. Already we have cited a dozen or more examples. Volu me I flames like a subtly gemmed ring with the ecstasy of many moments, and many of the following citations in this essay will be both brilliant and fl ashing; and as are the sides of the Heptagonal Vault, so also will be the contents of these seven chapters.

Such is the living poetry that abides and ever lives on, knowing no youth or age, alone an eternal manhood. Lavishly scattered, we find it throughout the works before us; in “Aceldama,” “Mys teries: Lyrical a nd Dramatic,” “The Temple of the Holy Ghost,” “Tannhä user,” “Rosa Mundi,” and “Alice.” Ecstasy is the keynote here, as it is of all poetry, all literatu re – aye! of all Life.

His thoughts are as subtle, his imagin ation as gorgeous, his melodies as charming as those of Shelley himself; soft as a summer breeze, fresh as the dawn in May, sunny as a June day, and then furious with burning passion and vitriolic lust. So closely interwoven in spirit are the true lyrics with the remainder of his amatory poetry, that it would be danger ous to attempt to separate them, and such an attempt would almost certainly lead to repetition or a breaking of the chain of psychos exual sensations, dimming that lustre which thrills through these magnificen t verses, from the chaste kiss of a mother to the Phaedrian embrace of a Sadistic sow. In “Why Jesus Wept,” we have the ephemeral and headstrong passion of youth; whilst in “The Tale of Archais” we find it burning only as a pure and lambent flame, overcoming all adversity, sacrificing self-love and even self- honour to attain the ideal of its purpose. Love is the predominant power in the universe; over and ove r again we shall find this enforced, greater than fame, than wealth, than glory, greater than knowledge, greater than wisdom, great er than the power of the Gods themselves; for they too must worship at the shrine of Love, the shrine of the great World Mother, the mystic Isis , goddess of beauty, mother of love, queen of laughter, mistress of pleasure. “ I am all that has been, that shall be, and none among mortals has hitherto taken off my veil .”* *Inscribed on the statue of the Goddess. Innocent friendship or platonic love can never be a success where the rapture of a kiss is burning on the lips of two lovers; the first spells ignorance and the second failure, for love will out, a nd if not as a limpid and sparkling stream, then as a turbid and roari ng torrent, reckless and horrible. This extraordinary phase of diverted* love is very strongly illustrated in “The"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Fatal Force,” “The Mother’s Tragedy, ” and also in “Jezebel”; not so in “Tannhäuser” and “The Nameless Quest, ” where love is not restrained, but rather cramped by the gnostic idea of ev il in the objective. This curious idea we will go into more fully later on, at present we shall content ourselves in dealing with the first phase of Love – love in youth. *”Perverted” I object to here, as it is bu t a synonym of ‘converted’ from a different point of view. In “Why Jesus Wept,” which is a sa tirical serio-comedy, mingled with heterodox ribaldry, and a shrewd a nd sweeping cynicism on the utter rottenness of social life, we find love in youth depicted in the person of Sir Percy Percival, aged sixteen. The firs t effusion of puberty is described in the-following three lines: ...what shall slake This terrible thirst, This torment accurst?* *Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 28. This, as is usually the case, finds an outlet in the first pretty maid who happens to cross youth’s burning path, and in this case the fair damozel is Molly Tyson, and the first scene of their meeting is most typical: Sir Percy . Ah, love, love, how I love you. This is the world! Love! Love! I love you so, my darling. Oh my white golden heart of glory!* *Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 30. Eternity is moulded in form of her ki ss, and even if “Hell belch its monsters one by: one to stop the way! I would be there” cries Sir Percy as he and Molly rush backwards and forwards kissing and kissing before they can finally part. And no sooner has he part ed with her, havi ng sworn eternal love and to meet her at moonrise, than he stumbles across a bedizened hag of sixty-three (society), and in ten mi nutes, because she calls herself “the wretchedest girl on the wide earth,” di scovers “she is most beautiful”; “How she speaks! It is indeed an angel singing,” and asks if he may call her Angela, and forgets his po or village girl, and u tterly overcome when she says, (“I am a poor and simple girl, a nd my eyes are aching with the sight of"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"you, and my lips are mad to kiss you!”) fa lls into her arms learning his first great lesson; for as Angela says, “it is dangerous, as well as cruel to leave a lover standing.” To wake again to all the effe rvesence of efflorescent youth: Awake! awake! There is a secret in our subtle union That masters the grey snake. Awake, O Love! and let me drink my fill Of thee – and thou of me!* *Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 40. His subtle union, however, is soon about to vanish, for Angela in a day or so will have just about had her fill: Angela . Die, then, and kiss me dead! Sir Percy . I die! I die! Angela . Thy flower-life is shed Into eternity, A waveless lake.* *Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 41. He sleeps, and she awake becomes somewhat weary of these “jejune platitudes,” these “ululations of preposterous puberty,” these very “eructations of gingerbread” and “fla tulence of calf-sickness.”* Soon he is kicked flying out of her ladyship’s bed, and here we must leave him for a time to meet him again and his first l ove Molly further on, though not under the sunshine of youthful amorosis. *Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 41. A different phase and a much more pleasing one of the impulsiveness of youthful love is given us in that glow ing story “The Tale of Archais.” There are many mysteries in this poem.

The picture of thei r meeting is beautiful indeed. Thus we find Archais: She lay within the water, and the sun Made golden with his pleasure every one Of small cool ripples that surround her throat, Mix with her curls, and catch the hands that float Like water-lilies on the wave.*1. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Chance bowed herself across the sunny bars, And watched where through the silence of the lawn Came Charicles, the darling of the dawn, Slowly, and to his steps took little heed; He came towards the pool, his god-wrought reed Shrilling dim visions of things glorious, And saw the maiden, that disported thus, And worshipped...*2. *1.

These last two lines contain the whole secr et of this story. The beauty of the clinging love of childhood is tinged with a glowing desire, the pink desire of the bud bursts into the passionate crims on of the rose, and as in “Alice,” “The dove gave place a moment to the swine;” – and yet hardly so! the pure desire of man and woman in whatever state of life, the weaving of the golden web of twain into one entity, is not lust, never was lust, never will be lust. According to the conventional meani ng of that word, lust expresses something unhealthy, unclean; and th e love Charicles bore Archais was certainly not that. This love, to us e a good old English word, was a “lusty” love, that is a healthy love, and not a lustful or perverted desire. The beauty of nature, the beauty of living, and a bove all the bright beauty of Archais; intoxicated him; before him whirled vi sions of loveliness, and as her eyes reflected the passion of his own, as th ey smiled back on him all the love he bore her, yielding, he caught her up as a flame would another, and the “iron rod of law” grew misty, for they were one, one in body, mind and soul; alone for that moment, sole inhabitant s of this World – Infinite. The moment is over, the girl rises up a woman, the wreath of lilies is now a crown of roses, she has plucked the golden fruit of Eden, henceforth she is a priestess of Sorrow; the crushed and bruised flow ers cry to her “such as we were we are not, such as thou wert thou canst never be again.” The horrid spell falls upon her, and she writhes from his arms a snake."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Charicles trembling, fearful, at last becomes aware that fate has overtaken them; then all the fury of manhood rises in him: Erect, sublime, he swore so fierce an oath That the sea flashed with blasphemy, and loath Black thunders broke from out the shuddering deep.

But that Heaven’s Lord Curbed their black wrath, th e stars of Heaven’s vault. Had rushed to whelm the s un with vehement assault.* *The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 12. Cf. th e Qabalistic Dogma of Pistorius: “Schema misericordiam dicit, sed et judicium.” The Infinite Being when exercising his power upon the finite must necessarily chastise to corr ect and not to avenge himself. The strength of the sin does not exceed that of the sinner, and if the pun ishment be greater than the offence, he who inflicts it becomes executi oner and is the real cr iminal, who is wholly inexcusable, and himself alone deserving of eternal punishment. Any being who is tortured above measure, enlarged by an in finitude of suffering, would become God, and this is what the ancients represented in the myth of Prometheus, immortalized by the devouring vulture, and destined to dethrone Jupiter. — The Mysteries of Magic , p. 120. Such is the power of Love, undaunted, infuriated in the cause of Freedom, Justice, and Truth. Charicles plunges into the waves of destiny, “And with his strenuous hands the emerald water gripped.” Onward he swims striving against Poseidon, god of the ocean, w ho heaps the sea foam against him, as he makes for the Paphian isle to se ek aid from the goddess of Love; and in his blinding anger he sees her not, though she is by his side journeying homeward from Rome. She raises the sw immer to her pearly car and carries him to her fair home, wh ere in the following beautiful symbolic action she promises to restore him his lost love – Archais. Then Aphrodite loosed a snake of gold From her arm’s whiteness, and upon his wrist Clasped it. Its glittering eyes of amethyst Fascinate him. “Even so,” the goddess cried, “I will bind on thy arm the serpent bride Freed from her fate, and promise by this kiss The warmer kisses of thy Archais.”* *The Tale of Archais, vol. i, pp. 13, 14."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The handmaidens of Aphrodite gather round them, and their silver voices rise in one of those sweet clear songs, al ready so familiar to our ears, set like a gem in the gold of the narrative.

Aphrodite bids Charicles flee, but his passion is too great, he defies the powers. (They are only gods; would he have succeeded had they been Grundy?)

So beautiful was she, that “the sun fo rgot his chariot, nor would set”; and in this mystic hour, the marriage of Da y and Night, she prayed fervently to Aphrodite, fond goddess of lovers, a nd there amidst the thunder-smitten stone, beautiful and piteous, she waite d, longing for that strong desire of love that had been so rudely snatched from her. Again, Love in the form of Aphrodite listens to her prayer, but is helpless to help her till she has sought aid from the lewd city of Aphaca, wher e Lust in the grim shape of Priapus dwelt. The large-lipped drawn-out grinning of that court That mouthed and gibbered in their swinish sport.* *The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 19. This curious duality of Love and Lust, or better, of Virtue and Vice, we shall attempt to explain more fully when we deal with the philosophy of Aleister Crowley. From Priapus, Phallommeda gains her necessary information, and then seeking Charicles, appears first as an old hag, soon to change again into her own brilliant form, thus symbolizing the joy she brought him from out the hideousness of his fate; fo r during the day he should assume the form of the divinest of divine maidens, and onl y at the passionate hour of noon, crawl away before the full glory of the sun a wriggling serpent. She bids him seek Zeus, and leaves the rest to him. “T o the lascivious shade of Ida’s deep recesses” he wends his way: So fair, her image in the brook might make A passionless old god his hunger slake By plunging in the waters, though he knew"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"His drowning body drow ned her image too.* *The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 21. There he, or now she, meets the gr eat god wandering through the green trees and the cool groves, as Jahveh was wont once to do. Amidst those shades of Ida, where Paris adjudged the pri ze of beauty, overlooking the blue Hellespont, the greatest sacrifice, and th ereby the purest that love can make, was to be demanded, and freely given – the sacrifice of a woman’s honour to save her lover; in fact to become a pr ostitute in body, and a virgin in spirit. He, Zeus, is “weary of women’s old la scivious breed,” and of “the large luxurious lips of Ganymede.” No freshne ss, no restraint, no virgin breast, no lips “without a taint of lewd imagin ing,” all the nymphs of those green wooded slopes, all are as brazen and co ld as the meretrices of a suburrian lupanar, the fire of love having burnt itself out to the ashen lassitude of satiety. At length the god finds her asl eep under some sha dy tree, and creeps towards her – little loath To waken her cares ses, and let noon Fade into midnight in the amorous swoon.* *The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 21.

The hour of noon approaches, it falls, a nd the curse resumes its sway; a fiery snake winds its coils round the sleepi ng god, and hisses in his ear, “awake!” The god has fallen, the god is caught, caught and bound in the lusts of the manhood he assumed. No Galilean is he to be crucified for his own or others’ sins, and he wins his freedom at the price of Charicles’ liberty. Nature breaks into a welcome chant of j oy, the lovers are reunited, the men’s praise is for Archais, and the eyes of the maidens are fixed on Charicles. The tale is nearly ended, the lovers wend their way through the joyous throng midst song and chorus, then from the lips of Archais rises: Light and dark are wed together Into golden weather: Sun and moon have kissed, and built"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Palaces star-gilt Whence a crystal stream of joy, love’s eternal wine, is spilt.* *The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 24. Such is one of the most pleasing of Aleister Crowley’s poems; touched by the genuine breath of adoration for the beautiful, a jewel set in fiery gold, a crimson sash embroidered with the pear ls of the glowing orient; Archais is one of the tenderest and most touching of women, wholly pure, not like Molly Tyson, who afterwards fell to th e lot of a worldly old lecher. The rosy couch of her first fiery experience soon withered to a thorny briar bed, as it has for most of us. Her curse was a god’s, Molly’s Society’s – poor Molly! Charicles’ love was the love of the hurricane, which carries all before it, typhoonic; he knew no fears, no bonds, he cursed the god who had defrauded him of his l oved one; and plunged undaunted into the ocean of adversity; to win back their former stat e he sacrificed himself. He was no Sir Percy, flatulent with wind, who could not tell a harlot from a virgin; falling at once a prey to a bedizened old prostitute of sixty-three. Those who should think the passion displa yed in this tale as unbecoming and lustful, must indeed have minds composed of dung and cantharides, disappointed sterile old maids, or sated old matrons, pornophobics of the worst description. We know well the cl ass, half Exeter Hall, half Empire Music-hall; “douée” (as a charming little French brochure describes one of this type), “du plus voluptueux tempérament courut longtemps les aventures... mais ses ans et le grand usag e altérèrent ses charmes, et elle prit le parti ordinaire, de donner à Dieu ce qu’elle ne pouvait plus offrir aux hommes, et pleura dans l’hypocrisie tr ente ans d’amour et de plaisir.” We know the type well, and so does Aleist er Crowley; his Angela, before she fell into the boiling sulphuric acid, whic h was being prepared to remove her enamel, was president of a Zenana Mission. Love is, as must now be apparent, an all engrossing theme in the poetry of Aleister Crowley, every phase almost meeting with an illustration. We have seen the flatulent love of youth, a nd its counterpart in the divine poetic sincerity of Charicles and Archais; we will now view it in its maturer form, and firstly, in the form of true a nd sincere love, unconventional and pure, whether under the bond of marriage, or under the boundless bond of free love, between two souls of similar affinity. True love is a pure, unalloyed attraction, urging two souls from their inherited duality into their inherent"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"oneness, that all are capable of attaini ng, and yet so few attain; and it is on account of the fewness of its adepts, that the magic of their worship has become to the clouded eyes of the many a heinous offence, reflecting a light that they cannot find in their gloomy atmosphere. Laws are the concrete opi nions of the many, morals the abstract sensations of the few. Outside ourselves ethics do not exist, for they are the great faculty of sentient existence. The law of the survival of the fittest is not moral, it is essential; but, manifest ed through reason it becomes ethical. As regards the aspirations of the sexes, nature cares little whether John loves Ann or Mary. Man, however, cares much. John is not married, Ann is; Nature implants a similar affinity in both, and they verge towards their own magnetic centre. Nature sa ys “unite!” Man, however, thinks otherwise and so builds up a stout abatis out of the dead bones of unreasoning ages, fencing Ann in; and even if John does surmount this formidable obstacle, a moral fougasse awaits for his impetuous footstep, which will morally blow him to smithereens. Again, John is unma rried, and Mary is in a similar state of bliss, their affinities repel and do not attract: Nature says “keep apart!”; man says “I would rather see you unite with Mary than I would with Ann, affinities be damned!” They unite, and axiomatize the postulate of Hell. Nature now says “part!” man says “Oh! no you don’t.” Around them are then speedily constructed such labyr inthine entanglements, that few find their way out, and still fewer attempt so difficult a task – hence Churches and Brothels. If John, however, does not marry Mary, Ann squalls, but as the jailer can always let himself out of th e prison, so can man, if he does not drop his keys through some matrimonial grating. Ann then locks up Mary in that Bastille of despair which is called Piccadilly (this is no paradox) – hence prudes and nymphs. Thus Nature is scouted and thumped on the nose because she is essential, and man is enthroned in her stead and smacked on the back because he happens to be moral – hence Universities and Lunatic asylums. In Love, mankind eternally verges be tween folly and knavery, because man is a non-essential being, a nd Nature an un-moral power. But before we enter on the above idea as demonstrated in the poems of Aleister Crowley, it will be necessary to elucidate matters, and first to enter on a brief description of the Essentia l and the Moral; showing that man as usual has got hold of “the muddy end of the stick”; that the majority of the human species live in a state of pur ulent hypocrisy and mental indolence,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"and that the minority should consider themselves exceptionally fortunate if they save their souls from incarceration in the bolgia of conventional respectability. Aleister Crowley’s gospel of Love is the gospel of Freedom. As love is one of those particular qualities that cannot possibly thrive under the perception of restraint, so can it only bloom in perfect freedom, whether legalized or not; all other forms are Lust. Nature is the All-perfect, she is exis tence taken as a totality, and everything being a part of her, consequently is subject to her government. The inorganic, and what we choose to ca ll the organic, are her two greatest manifestations. Some consider these tw o as definitely se parate; ethers that the organic is but a higher form of the inorganic; and others again that both are illusions, and that Reality, as we suppose it materially to be, does not exist outside our own minds. We do not intend to enter here the illusive paths of Idealism; but we might add, from a strictly logical point of view, that the latter system has much to suppor t it. In all and every one of us lies a certain individual desire, which is stri ctly subjective, in the individual it is called character, in the nation governme nt. The laws of a country are the compilation of a series of individual characterizations, a series of inner reflections of the outer object. In each one of us there is a slight difference of effect, and this variation results in th e survival of the fittest intellect. Now the essential difference between the sp irit of an individual and that of a nation is this: the first acts intuitivel y, the second mechanically; the former propels the latter, whilst the latter re acts as a drag on the former. If the former is in a healthy state so will th e latter be; if the latter becomes corrupt it will then react and contam inate the former. This is the law of all Form – i.e. , Government – and Reform. The outlaw of to-day was the citizen of yesterday, so the law of to-day will become the crime of tomorrow. Man being inherently lazy , and hence conservative, this power is forever reacting on him, and binding him down to a government unsuited to his times, and it is this power that he has chosen to call – the Moral code; notwithstanding the fact that it is not based in any way on the perceptions he has obtained from Nature’s code as it now is reflected, but on that reflection which was obtained by his ancestors, a far less worthy appreciation. And in this inherent conservativeness and horror of change lie most of the tragedies"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"of love; for man trying to quench the na tural flame of his desires in a torrent of chilly and criminal atavism, merely floods the virtuous path, leaving the by-ways of vice high and dry, invi ting, crying to the sated wanderer. Man lives by paradoxes a nd contraries; martyrs and tortures himself, building around him lofty restri ctions bristling with moral frises , and broken ethical beer-bottles, digging deep tren ches around his joys, and then filling them with the tears of exasperation at his lot. All is either monopoly, or slavery, or taboo. Free in his actions he conceived law and solicitors; free in his aspirations, religion and priests; free in his affections, marriage and wives. Inwardly he agrees that marri age is a success only when it comprises a total unison of mind, body and s oul, of sympathies and passions; outwardly that it is a perpetual seal, sealed by God. Dr. Maudsley once said, “No one can escape the tyranny of his organization,” but woe to the man who cannot dissemble that he can! Ma rriage, the hackne yed sexual union, is a lie to love, a legalizing of prostit ution, an abortive horror, over which broods the grinning form of the Jew- God – God of lechers and harlots, of David and Rahab. What si ght more truly pitiable than to behold the tender heart of some young girl, or the ardent spirit of another, cramped by this unnatural bond, and denied the joys of a beneficent Nature, that yearning to love and be loved. But not with impunity do we thus triumph over our natures; love cannot be so rudely supp ressed; the primary want of our being must inevitably conquer. Looking back on history we find few parallels to the general lust of the present day. Tw o thousand years of the Cross have to- day left as token of its morality 80,000 prostitutes on the London streets alone.* “Can that have been human?” I see you point through the drizzling night to a cramped and shivering form . Can that have been a woman? That living death, degraded by crime, bruta lized by vice, vitiated, unsouled; lower than a slave, worse than a dog; spurned by man, shunned by woman, a human wreck, a growing horror? Even so, once a smiling girl, sweet as a rose, pure as a lily; now the bedraggl ed gin-sodden harridan. O! marriage, thy name is Failure: O! priest, wh at hast thou done? Cramped the human mind, betrayed thy trust, sacrificed l ove on the altar of Mammon, leaving the heart as a blighted flower, the soul as a hollow shell, void, execrable. *In 1861 Henry Mayhew stated that the assu med number of prostitutes in London was about 80,000. And further adds— “large as this total may appear, it is not improbable that it is below the reality than above it. One th ing is certain – if it be an exaggerated statement – that the real number is swolle n every succeeding year, for prostitution is an inevitable attendant upon extended ci vilization and increased population.” — London Labour and London Poor , p. 213."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Even love is sold, the solace of all woe Is turned to deadliest agony, old age Shivers in selfish beauty’s loathing arms And youth’s corrupted impulses prepare A life of horror from the blighting bane Of commerce; whilst the pestilence that springs From unenjoying sensualism, has filled All human life with hydra-headed woes. So sang Shelley. Now let us turn to Al eister Crowley, and we shall find his ideal no less great, noble and true than that of Shelley’s, the divinest of the poets and pioneers of Truth, Freedom, and Beauty. Love is the finding in others what othe rs cannot find in them, and it is of two degrees. The love of a mother toward s her child; and the love of man and woman towards woman and man. The first is gene rally considered to be purer and more ideal, but this idea has only grown out of man’s entire ignorance regarding the physical relati onships. The mother is in no way purer than the wife, neither is the vi rgin purer than th e mother. The truest definition of chastity is that as gi ven by Benjamin Franklin, which defines chastity as “the regulated and strictly temperate satisfaction without injury to others, of those desires which are natu ral to all healthy adult beings.”* The reason for this idea of uncleanliness though certainly obscure is traceable more particularly to the utter mystery man saw in this supreme function, and also, that all hygienic laws being unknown to him, any disease resulting from the act was attributed indirectly to the woman – instead of to his own want of knowledge – and di rectly to the supernatural manifesting its wrath through her as a medium; for the supernatural to primitive man’s understanding invariably took the shap e of malevolent and not benevolent powers. This and the periodic functio ns of the woman, as well as, as Westermarck says, “the instinctive feeling against intercourse between members of the same family or hous ehold,” developed the conception of uncleanliness in. an act which has been rightly stated by Geoffrey Mortimer as being “the eternal symbol of love and life, and the purest of human joys,” and which act being attributed to supernatural powers came under the authority of religion, and fell into th e hands of an interested priesthood, giving them an immense power ove r women, and through women over men; an influence that has been exercised in every land, and every age, by these spiritual leaders: an influence by which they have in so many cases ruled the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"minds of men, and by which for so ma ny centuries they have blighted the happiest prospects of many a human he art. But surely now that we have reached the twentieth century, thousands and thousands of years since these primitive times, should we not shake o ff these trammels of infant thought, and, assuming our manhood, decry an ideal that is not only brutal but absurd; instead of reverenc ing it because of its great antiquity, or because of our conservative sympathies with the pa st days of our fathers. Woman is as clean as man, and a wife married or unmarried as pure as any virgin. Generation is no more filthy than alim entation; both are necessary, both are accompanied by natural appe tites; the one maintains the individual, the other the race; both may be carried to extremes, both may become lusts. *A disciple of Pythagoras once asked him, when was it permitted him to cohabit with his wife? To which that philos opher replied: “When you are ti red of resting.” Théano, wife of Pythagoras, was also once asked: “How long does it take for a woman to be purified who has known a man?” To which she answer ed: “If it is with her husband, she is purified by the act, if with another she is fo r ever defiled.” For it is not marriage which sanctifies love, but love which justifies marriage. —EDOUARD SCHURÉ The world is ever progressing onward, and we must progress with it, or else stagnation and retrogressi on will set in; and in these competitive times the latter two spell social and moral death. What was good yesterday may be bad to-day, and what is good to-day may be evil to-morrow. What the ultimate end will be, none can tell, for it lies “behind the veil”; but what we must do is very certain, very definite, very sure. We must ameliorate our lot, not by the ephemeral laws of the dead , but through the needs and wants of the living, on the solid foundation of the truest possible morality, based on Nature, and manifested to us throu gh our divine powers of reason. And much of this new morality do we fi nd in the love-gospel of Aleister Crowley. First turning to the love incarnate in motherhood, we find a touching case in the picture of Cora in “The Mother’s Tragedy.” Cora Vavasour, late of the halls, yet as true and noble a woman as ever lived, a type of woman that, thank Heaven, is not so uncommon am ong those whom the prudes call fallen classes. Cora was scarcely, however, one of these; living in luxury she tried to bury the recurring past, “Old hours of horror,” and she trusted that “God hath made smooth the road beneath the hearse” of her “forgetful age.” Let me not shrink! Truth always purifies. . . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"One night I stepped up tremulous on the stage, Sang something, found my senses afterward Only to that intolerable sound Of terrible applause.

Another picture of maternal affection, this time more musical, we find in “The Spring after,” of “Myste ries: Lyrical and Dramatic”: No smallest cloud betw een me and my bride Came like a little mist; one tender fear, Too sweet to speak of, closed the dying year With love more perfect, for its purple root Might blossom outward to the snowy fruit Whose bloom to-night lay sleeping on her breast.* *Mysteries; Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 94. True love, the love of self in the soul of another, the poet paints very beautifully in the following charming lines: Do you recall? Could I forget? How once the full moon shone above, Over the houses, and we let Loose rein upon the steeds of love?

This melting of the I in you, is the onl y true possible form of marriage, and the only form that can exalt it over th e prostitution of the monde and demi- monde; for it matters little if a woman sell her body for a fi ve pound note, or for a five million pound dot . The man who in his tu rn marries a woman for her wealth is as foul a male prostitute as ever shrieked his lewd obscenities in the street of Sodom, and down the by-ways of Gi beah. Tannhäuser expresses the whole celebration of th is union in two pregnant lines: That is true marriage, in my estimate. Aspire together to one Deity? Yes!* *Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 259.

What a melody lives in those words, “Twas thy spotless life alone.” Rama through all his misfortunes, through a ll the snares of life, finds ultimately that all his woes are but a teardrop to be swallowed up in that boundless ocean of love – the heart of a chaste and loving wife. And so did Ahinoam in Jephthah when he said: And my wife’s eyes were welcome more desired Than chains of roses, and the song of children, And swinging palm branches , and milk-white-elders.* *Jephthah, vol. i, p. 82. No thunderous note (so common in the poems of Crowley) lies in the above three lines, to roll on into the stillness of Immensity; it is but the song of the nightingale by the rill of life. Here as a vision we see a fair form embroidering the web of existence with the flowers that grow on the banks of life’s flowing stream, collecting as she works the stray threads of philosophy, of science, of industry, of war, and of peace; the sweat, the laughter, the tears of existence, to weave them into the great garment of Love. This again is the true, the Higher Love: A thousand years have passed, And yet a thousand thousand; years they are As men count years, and yet we stand and gaze With touching hands and lips immutable As mortals stand a moment;...

Listen: Yes. A good woman’s love will forge a chain To break the spirit of the bravest Greek; While with an harlot one may leap again Free as the waters of the western main, And turn with no heart-pang the vessel’s beak Out to the oceans that all seamen seek.”* *Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 121. Another, this time a weird, charming little picture of a lewd little mistress with “a generous baby soul ,” we include here; for su ch a one at any rate is not a true prostitute, rather a poor deluded girl, yearning to love and be loved, romantic and foolish, yet kindh earted and charitable to a fault: often the plaything of man, and oftener the means of livelihood of some bad woman. As Jenny wrapped in “the homage of the dim boudoir,” was Nina; one of that large flotsam of fragile girlhood which forms the better drift of vice, the first to be swallowed in the social Maelstrom. Yes: Nina was a thing of nought, A little laughing lewd gamine, Idle and vicious, void of thought, Easy, impertinent, unclean— Utterly charming! Yes, my queen! She had a generous baby soul, Prattled of love. Should I control, Repress, perhaps, the best instinct The child had ever had? I winked At foolish neighbours, did not shirk.

Nina is our guide, pointing us ou t the hill-top road which will lead us above the social plain, and awed by the mystic love of woman, Racing and maddening from the crown of flame, The monolithic core of mystical Red fury that is called a woman’s heart.* *Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 232.

The first poem in the book is called “M essaline.”*1. It is in a way a foreword to the ensuing sonnet-sequence, and yet in a way it is not, its spirit being more essentially of Lust; for whatever the “unco gude” may say, that of Alice and her lover is not. To adu lterate is to debase; but there is no debasement here. Love bur ns pure as a flame, and if it is, as it is here, between a married woman a nd a lover who is not he r legal husband, so much deeper the lesson, so much vaster the love; defying all fo r its own sake: and here, as we shall see in the end, sacrif ices itself, so as not to tarnish the names of innocent children, which the old harridan Society would otherwise have besmirched with her foul saliva. In “Messaline” we however have, as the poet says “leprous entanglements of sense”; here is a magnificent passage heated with pa ssion and not a little lust: Breast to great breast and thigh to thigh, We look, and strain, and laugh, and die. I see the head hovering above To swoop for cruelty or love; I feel the swollen veins below The knotted throat, the ebb and flow Of blood, not milk, in breasts of fire; Of deaths, not fluctuants, of desire; Of molten lava that abides Deep in the vast volcanic sides; Deep scars where kisses once bit in Below young mountains that be twin, Stigmata cruciform of sin, The diary of Messaline.* *1. In the second edition, the firs t edition began with White Poppy. *2. Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 63.

In these two short poems we have th e spirit of Alice offered us, passionate and sublime; a harmonious blending of Messaline and Margaret in the form of one sweet woman. In none of the sonnets can it be said th at there is a single scene of lechery. True we shall have our Buchanans a nd their ilk, and we still have Rossetti’s poems with one of his finest sonne ts excised to please Mrs. Grundy; but matters it what the sewer-rat thinks of the linnet’s songs? leave him in his dank drain, for we need him not, neither his opinions. There is a great lesson embodied in this poem. The lesson that Love is only worthy its hallowed name, when free; that it is only worth having when freely given, and worth keeping when freely held, without bond or writ. This freedom we find in the very first sonnet: Against the fiat of that God discrowned, Unseated by Man’s Justice, and replaced By Law most bountiful and maiden-faced And Mother-minded: passing the low bound Of Man’s poor law we leapt at last and found Passion; and passing the dim halls disgraced Found higher love and la rger and more chaste, A calm sphinx waiting in secluded ground.* *Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 64. The first day of meeting he gazes on her, and wonders whether Fate had found at last a woman’s love for him; hopelessly he turns away and sinks the dream of his soul in despair and “K indled a corpse-light and proclaimed ‘The day!’” Thither I fled, busied myself with these; When – lo! I saw her shadow following!"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"In every cosmic season-tide of spring She rose, being the spring: in utter peace She was with me and in me: thus I saw Ours was not love, but destiny, and law.* *Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 65. Such is True Love, whether it be the l ove of a virgin, a harlot, or a wife. No man-made law, no convention, no ceremony can create it; for it is spontaneous, anarchic; few are its child ren, and still fewer its warriors. All that this lover sees breathes “Alice”; a ll that he hears reverberates with her name; all that he smells holds the cli nging scent of her hair, Alice, Alice, Alice! He feels she is beyond him; yet in his ear whispers the Master; whose power is rapture. I drew a hideous talisman of lust In many colours where strong sigils shone; Crook’d mystic language of oblivion, Fitted to crack and scorch the terrene crust And bring the sulphur steaming from the thrust Of Satan’s winepre ss, was ill written on The accurséd margin, and the orison Scrawled backwards, as a bad magician must. By these vile tricks, abominable spells, I drew foul horrors from a many hells— Though I had fathomed Fate; though I had seen Chastity charm-proof ar m and sea gray eyes And sweet clean body of my spirit’s queen, Where nothing dwells that God did not devise.* *Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 66. The sonnets relating the events of the seventh to the tenth day are dismal, attempting to drown Love in Lust. On the twelfth a little flame burns up, then comes the poem, which Alice re ceives and reads.

The still horror creeps silently on, envelopi ng them in the shroud that man has woven as the garment of love: Since our pure shame unworthily destroys The love of all she had, her girls and boys, Her home, their lives: and yet my whisper stirs Into live flame her passion, and deters Her fear from spurning all the day’s due joys.* *Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 73. The pudibonderie of the English would call this lust. Indeed, drunken on their own crapulous imagination, choked by their venomous vomit, they cannot see the divine form of Love through the mist of their steaming sensuality. For what reason did man tie woman to him? For what reason did he devise the horrors of indissoluble marriage? And the answer is: that he might ever have at least one poor victim to sate his vile carnalities on. Lust and Indolence are the parents of Marriag e and Law, but not even the menials of Freedom and Free Love. We clung still closer, till the soul ran through Body to body, twined like sunny snakes, Sinlessly knowing we were man and wife.* *Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 73. Alice, still fearful, foresees the end; such love as theirs is too supernal to be platonic; she flies in vain; for she has to console her sad lover with the truth. The storm-clouds gather on the twenty-fifth day: Mouth unto mouth! O fairest! mutely lying, Fire lambent laid on water – O! the pain!

A curious conflict this ‘twixt love a nd fear, “honour and lust, and truth and trust beguiled”; they wandered in the sc ented garden of man’s heart, and all their restraint was as ephemeral as the fleeting hour. “And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband w ith her; and he did eat.” (N.B. — Husband : neither church nor registry office is mentioned!) Linked in the tiny shelf upon the ship, My blind eyes burned into her mild ones: limbs Twined to each other while fine dew bedims Their quivering skins: lip fastened unto lip: Whole soul and body fre nzied meet and clip; And the breath staggers, and the life-blood swims! Terrible gods chant black demoniac hymns As the frail cords of honour strain and slip. For in the midst of that tremendous tide The mighty vigour of a god was mine! Drunk with desire, her lamentations died. The dove gave place a moment to the swine! Rapturous draughts of madness! Out she sighed Uttermost life’s love, and became a bride* *Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 77. “Many sins are forgiven this woman because she hath loved much.” Not like Adam and Eve, however, did they then discover that they were naked, such epilogues being more especia lly suited to the author of “Lot and his Daughters” and “The Concubine of Gibeah,” than the author of “Tannhäuser” or “Alice.” Ne vertheless reproach follo wed, if shame did not, the celebration of love’s mystic eu charist.

Still the future rises up before them, as a serpent, “prescience of next year”; the Minotaur, “prodigious offspring of the fatal graft?” But the present is a sublime kiss, and the future as hollo w as the emblem of two parted lips, “while love was hovering and our lips were fain?” Soon the parting draws nigh, he attempts to detain her; but he knows he must in evitably fail, as he knew his first kiss must inevitably lead to their great love and surrender.

And at last: THE FIFTIETH DAY At noon she sailed for home, a weeping bride Widowed before the honeymoon was done. Always before the rising of the sun I swore to come in spirit to her side And lie like love; and she at eventide Swore to seek me and gather one by one The threads of labyrinthine love new spun, Cretan for monstrous shadows serpent-eyed.

Fascinated we read its verses again and again, dazzled with their mystic beauty, their harmony, and, above all, their intense human love. As the Editor says, thos e who fail to find religion in such poems must indeed be idiots, idio ts who would bowdlerize Shakespeare, Shelley, and Browning. Neith er was their love a mere selfish gratification of the senses. Anxiously they waited to see “whether the mother stood behind the bride,” falteringly he w ould not part with her till she held the key of the hereafter”; and ultimately they resi gned all for the sake of others: Even while I begged her, I well knew she must. We could not, loving to see children laugh, Let cowards twit them with their mother’s lust. Even our own purity confirmed the trust. How long, O Lord, how long? Too long by half Till men read, wondering, wedlock’s epitaph.* *Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 82.

Before this statue he is brought; her bronze and chilly loins are girded with the sacred gold of lust, her lips are lecherous and large, inviting to kiss: But somehow blood was black upon them; blood In stains and clots and splashes; and the mud Trampled around her by the souls that knelt, Worshipping where her false lewd body dwelt, Was dark and hateful; and a sleepy flood Trickled therefrom as magic gums that melt.*1. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

So ends the first part of this mysti cal and symbolic poem, In the second part the Queen speaks, her love is similar to that of “Alice,” if not sublimer: “I was so glad he loved enough to go” – “my arms could ne ver have released his neck.” The King dies and soon the Queen also. Love is symbolized in this poem in its higher form as above de ath. She seeks and finds “There is no sin.” And I? I knew not anything, but know We are still silent, and united so, And all our being spells one vast To Be, A passion like the passion of the sea.* *Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic. vol. i, p. 101. Besides the freedom of lovers, Aleist er Crowley advocates the freedom of the children of love; he does not visit the sins of the fathers on the children, as conventionality cruelly does.

If the carnal act is f oul, it is then as foul in th e palace as in the brothel: mere prostitution of the body need not necessarily mean a similar prostitution of the mind, as we saw in the “Tale of Archais.” Every woman’s body is as free a possession of her own as that of every man is of his own, and what is disgraceful to woman is equally disgraceful to man, and vice versâ . Law to be true must be just, a nd as long as man wages war against woman for sins that he condones in himself, so long will vice reign supreme, so long will women prove themselves deceivers, harpyiæ and sirenes, let alone Eumenides. Most will recognize the following as the opening scene in Terence’s “The Mother-in-Law,” whic h play sums up the matter tersely enough: *The Poem, vol., i, p. 58."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Philotis . I’ faith, Syra, you can find but very few lovers who prove constant to their mistresses. For instance, how often did this Pamphilus swear to Bacchis – how solemnly, so that anyone might have believed him – that he never would take home a wife so long as she lived. Well now, he is married. Syra . Therefore for that very reas on, I earnestly both advise and entreat you to take pity upon no on e, but plunder, fleece, and rend every man you lay hold of. Philotis . What! Hold no one exempt? Syra . No one; for not a single one of them, rest assured, comes to you without making up his mind, by means of his flatteries, to gratify his passion with you at th e least possible expense. Will you not, pray, plot against them in return? Philotis . And yet, upon my faith, it is unfair to be the same to all. Syra . What! unfair to take reve nge on your enemies? or for them to be caught in the very way they try to catch you? Alas! wretched me! why do not your age a nd beauty belong to me, or else these sentiments of mine to you? So long as we mentally castrate ourse lves, so long will this world remain a stew-pot of vice; for it is only when we have realized the ideal of Free Love, and have taken the matrix of pros titution and cut from it the gem which underlies all its gross vulgarity and sens uality, that we shall become initiates in the code of the Essen tial and ameliorate our lot. To this poem indeed we trust, that God will write a fitting end. If at one end of a sequence we find a buse, then at the other extremity we shall inevitably discover disuse; polarit y is universal; hot, cold; good, bad, etc. This duality is in reality only a pparent, there being no definite line of division. So in Love, if one system of Ethics tends towards abuse, then we may be certain that the reverse will be uselessly sterile, and that the only possible system to follow will as usual lie directly between these extremes, and in this case, in the region of Use. If now, supposing at one end of our pole we find Lust seated crimson as a rose, then at the other we shall find Chastity white as a lily. This system of extremes has dur ing the world’s history exerted an overwhelming force on the will of man. Beholding a satyr he worshipped a virgin; feeling the ills of the flesh, he conceived the bliss of the soul. This"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"diametric opposition, verging ever to wards the extreme circumference of utility, has given and is giving birth to numerous world-wide systems and philosophies. The taboos of the South Seas, the re strictions laid on widow-remarriage in India, the purdah of the Mussulman, the veil of the Vestal, the numerous accounts of Virgin-mothers, all find their origin in this idea. The laws of the Vedas, of Manu, of B uddha, the codes of Confuc ius and Lao-Tze, the Talmudic books of the Jews, and the Ko ran of the Mohamedans, all maintain its direct influence and restrictions; and in the West in the old mythologies of Teuton and Celt, in the old Norse sagas, more so in the Roman and Grecian law, and still more so on th e Christian edicts of Constantine, Theodoric, Athalaric, and Justinian, and the innumerable codes of the Middle Ages: all of which growing one into the other have produced that truly revolting state of affairs belting th e world with Lust. As every one of us has been bred on dead flesh, so every one of us passes along our way spiritually encumbered w ith the dead bones of our ancestors’ opinions; and living with them we die, only to add more mental tibias and spiritual metatarsals to the groaning back of the future. In the Kingdom of Love these extremes gave birth to two forces, “Neronic Lust” and “Platonic Affection.” From a heterogeneous mass of ics, ists, and ians, sprang the idea that there was an i nherent evil in the culmination of the nuptial state; and out of it grew the preying vampirism of Paul. ‘This inherent evil supposed to lie latent in matter, as opposed to the bliss of spirit, Crowley sets forth very forcibly in se veral of his poems. In “The Growth of God” we have most of the argument in the following lines: The Shapeless, racked with agony, that grew Into these phantom forms that change and shatter; The falling of the first toad-spotted dew; The first lewd heaving ecstasy of matter.* *The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 178. The idea grows still more powerfully in the next verse: I see all Nature claw and tear and bite, All hateful love and hideous: and the brood Misshapen, misbegotten out of spite;"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Lust after death; love in decrepitude.

In Tannhäuser, which is an intensely psychologic drama, we find the Knight speaking thus to Venus: Ah, if pure love could grow material! There are pure women! and this is her answer: There you make me laugh! Remember – I have known such. But besides You ask hot snow and leaden feather-flights!* *Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 237. Which contains a great truth, namely, th at platonic love is no love at all. An affection it may be, but love it cannot be if it dare not see its form mirrored in the eyes of a loving woman. Its failu re in the end is a certainty; certain ascetics may compel their wills to conque r their natures, but men as a whole cannot. Certain maniacs such as Origen may emasculate themselves for the Kingdom of God, but the great huma n masses will let the Kingdom of God go to the Devil, if a pretty pair of lip s is in question. Not for long in any case can we change our natures, as the an chorites of the Libyan deserts only too fearfully proved; boiling with carnalitie s they feared to see their own mothers, and were even forbidden to keep in their possession animals of the female sex – O Stylites! they are now in heaven! How we clave together! Ho w we strained caresses! How the swooning limbs sank fainting on the sward!

In “The Nameless Quest” and “Tannhäuser,” we find represented this striving after a more spiritual and pl atonic ideal of love. In the former, questing for the ideal of his hopes, man falls tangled into the arms of the real; in the latter, entangled, he stri ves to tear away the meshes of his passion, and at length succeeds in rele asing himself from the magic threads. In “The Nameless Quest,” Gereth is in love with the Queen, and the King calls on a knight to go on the Nameless Qu est to a certain pillar which lies at the end of the road which leads from Human desire to Divine contentment; around it lie the bones of the “quest ing slain” unburied, unremembered, unconfessed; Gereth’s name is crie d aloud, and the King bids him God- speed, girding on him his own true sw ord, whilst the Queen draws from her finger a ring and places it on his. Then when he has left their presence he notices for the first time: There was no jewel in the ring she gave! for it was the emblem of her total surrender: Oh my pure heart! Adulterous love began So subtly to identify the man With its own perfumed thoughts. So steals the grape Into the furtive brain – a spirit shape Kisses my spirit as no woman can.

A man who truly loves a woman loves her so inte nsely that all else is as naught; she grows before him gigantic through the mist of his desire, swallowing him up in the affinity of her being. The Ki ng’s sword was of little use; the pillar of the Higher Self lay in the salt-encruste d plains, saline with the tears and sobs of failure; the ring emblematic of surre nder, without beginning or end, was emblematic also of the eternality of l ove, that circling girdle of the world. In “Tannhäuser” we have a simila r idea, though reversed; for Tannhäuser enmeshed in the web of the Venusberg, strives against the sensual to gain a spiritual victory; whilst in “The Nameless Quest” the knight, fearful of falling in the sensual slough, seeks, and loses his straight way in the spiritual desert. Thus, as in the la tter case, the striving against the desire of a pure love leads to an almost certain failure , so in the former, when sunk deep in the mud of an impure affection, even if released from its circling arms, worldly mercy is as cold to him w ho has plunged through the Cytherean sea as a winter in Gaul. Thus Ignoran ce has bound, fettered, and manacled love to the dingy fornices of the lupanar.

The path of Vice we must tread before we can find the high road of Virtue, and Vice we must wed befo re we can open the gates of a more perfect understanding. The great Comma ndment is: “Live in the midst of Vice; but heed that Vice doth not live in thy midst.”* * Vide Hosea. “God is the Complex and the Protoplas t.” And so are we; entwined within us, as in the poem of Tannhäuser, li e the countless threads of inherited tendencies.

In him, as in the hero of “The Nameless Quest,” they wage an et ernal contest, it not being till he has passed through the Venusberg of mental and physical lust, that he attains the graal of his hopes and aspirations: O God, Thy blinding beauty, and the light Shed from Thy shoulders, and the golden night Of mingling fire, and stars and roses swart In the long flame of hair that leaps athwart, Live in each tingling gossamer!

In the above we still find the now almo st dead echo of his higher self, yet Venus entices him on, comparing their fi erce lust to the lukewarm affection of those little lovers who strip their maidens bare, “And find them – naked! Poor and pitiful!” directly the gl amour of their foolish honeymoon has tarnished. His uneasiness is soon dispelled: “Come, in this sweet abandonment of self” – whispers the singing voice of Venus, and so following he sings: Come, love, and kiss my shoulders!

Society is but a gaping and t oothed gin, as he well shows in “The Honourable Adulterers” where women, the frailer sex, are the unfortunate victims. Man made God, and God made woman out of one of man’s wretched little ribs. Regardless of manners, man sucks the wretched little bone as he would the leg of a chicken, tears off the flesh and casts it into the bin. The masses are but sheep, following the bell-wether convention; deprive them of their initial, and they beco me neither lambs nor tigers but merely asses.

So it is to-day. Conventionalism is passing along its way chaotic and disordered. Mutinus is worshipped at every street corner, and the goat of Mendes slavers over the revellers as th ey wend their way home with their Gitons and Messalinas. “The decay of a people, as well as a family, begins with the preponderance of selfishness,”*1. so says Max Nord au; and similarly Paul Carus writes, “We know of no decline of any nation on earth, unless it was preceded by an intellectual and moral rottenness, whic h took the shape of some negative creed or scepticism, teaching the maxi m that man lives for the pleasure of living, and that the purpose of our li fe is merely to enjoy ourselves.”*2. Even as early as the middle of the se venteenth century, Adrian Beverland in his Justinianœi de stolatae Virginitatis [ sic ] noticed this social collapse: “dum puellas nostrates adeo verecundi am suam perfricta fronte excutiant, ut a lupis, tremula clune extentoque collo saltantibus, vix discerni possint.”*3. When the rich approach the poor, “alte ra manu fert panem, penem ostentat altera.” Such is another Pantagruelism of Beverland, crude yet to the point. “The girl who of her own accord presen ts herself to student, soldier or artist, is considered, by Jove! to give a head long consent to debauchery.”*4.

Again, in others so subtle is the psychology of sense that this hysterical clinging to the Chaste often reacts, hurling its unfortunate aspirant into th e arms of Lubentina. The lust after God and the lust after man are near akin. A woman crossed in love and debarred from enjoying the sweet embraces of her lover, will embrace in his stead the sour feet of her God. Si milarly, Magdalene, having passionately sought love, and having lost the skei n of her desires in the labyrinthine byways of lust, threw her weeping form at the feet of Him in whom she found the ideal of her affection, washi ng those dusty feet with her tears, and drying them with the long tresses of her hair, still perfumed with the kisses of a thousand lovers. Jesus Christ a nd John Smith are very nearly related, and a woman who is capable of loving one is also capable of loving the other. Flaubert finely pictures this when he represents Madame Bovary, kneeling at her prie-dieu and addressi ng to her Lord the same sweet words she had formerly murmured to her love r in the effusions of adultery. So it often happens that the most spiritual are at heart the most passionate. Passion and Religion are the divine Dioscuri, children of Nemesis. Man, when God became too intangi ble, too magnificent to approach, conceived a mediator. Jahveh, surr ounded by howling beasts and moulting angels, fenced in by thunder and lightni ng, was quite cut off from the simple minds of the Suburra, so Christ in those purlieus was manufactured; but He in His turn grew exaltedly dim, magni fied as the mist of ages crept around Him, and when romantic love wa s born, man being no longer able to worship man, enthroned the spotless Virg in in his stead; for in his heart still lingered the sea-born form of Aphrod ite, and on his lips the warm kisses of the Cytheræn goddess, Philommedis, Basile a, Isis, or Astarte, call her what you will, of passionate Love. So Chri st was enthroned amongst the gods, and His tender mother, the ever chaste Virg in, set on the humbler throne over the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"destiny of men’s hearts; yet awake, the actual man loses the ideals of his dreaming hours, straining to his heart th e form of her whom he loves best on earth, deserting his heavenly bride for his earthly spouse. Such is the duality of love – the mundane and the celestial. Which nations now are the most passi onate, the man-worshippers or the woman-worshippers? the latter, and it is for this reason that I included Tannhäuser in the first part of this essa y, rather than in the second, dealing with the philosophy of Aleister Crowle y. It is this spiritual exaltation, curious as it may seem, which so often links the pure true love to the foul false love. Love of man and woman is normal, love of man and woman for God is abnormal, and the abnormal in its turn breeds the lustful, whether the abnormality lies in the twists of the mind or the aberrations of the soul. Amnon lusted after Tamar, he was a mental monster; Ezekiel devoured dung, he was a spiritual abortion. That a passionate nature is necessarily a lustful one, is often no more the case than that a lustful one need necessa rily be passionate; that lust as well as passion often inhabit the same mind is true enough, and that its forms are monstrous must be apparent to all students of sexual psychology; as the cold-blooded lust of the lecher, who can only find stimulation for his gross lecheries in the horrors of a de Sade , devouring in security and ease maidens and youths, as the minotaur did of old – “semibovemque virum, semivirumque bovem.” This is the lust which is the most horrid, and the most damnable; it takes much to produce a passionate man, but little to engender a lustful one. The presen t generation possesses a minimum of passion and a maximum of lust. There is no lust of Rome, of Greece, or Arabia, no vice of Sodom, of Paphos, or Lampsacus, that is not practised to- day in any of our larger modern towns. Lust of wealth, lust of ease, lust or renown, lie as cankering wo rms in our hearts; and the cold bought lust of our marriage-beds and our streets fill our da ys with woe. Chivalry is dead, and the gilded Ass reigns in the place of the champing Stallion, and brays its goatish desires over the naked form of the sterile Mule.

For this is passion, if not quite so pur e as some we have already seen, yet still passion of an unlustful nature.

The horror of this mental struggle is well depicted in “Jephthah” when Jared says: Those eyes upon me, torturing my soul And threatening revenge?

In such cases utter satiety of the ordinary forms of pleasur e gives birth to the desire for the pain which was once dreaded, and the pl easure that the individual once experienced in himself, and also the pleasure he felt wa s being experienced by the participator of his actions, changes, growing little by little from a spark into a flaming volcano of scor ching pain, which he alone seeks, finding new pleasures in the pain he himself endures, and fresh pleasures in"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"the pain he himself inflicts.

Paeder asts and Tribades flock round us, yet we break away from them only to en ter the foul jaws of the sexual hell of shrieking flagellants, who rush upon us, as obscene Masochists grovel at our feet; far into its depths we sink, and there at the altar of Phallommeda sits a foul vulture gloating over a corp se; and its name is Necrophilia. Into the realms of sexual-neurasthenia Aleister Crowley takes us, and it is necessary that he should. His religi on, his philosophy, and his psychology, all point to an ultimate blending of our extreme perfections and imperfections – vice and virtue – in one great monistic unity. He that would be wise must know all things, all things that his transient life can enable him to grasp. In the age which produced Rabelais and Boccaccio, vice was flagrantly open, and the lust which the early Christians had first opposed and secondly absorbed, slowly burnt within the society of their days, till it burst out in the lecherous flames of a libidinous papacy. Many witty and lascivious books, which in those tim es were openly enjoyed, have been handed down to us. In the north the pur itanic upheaval, still so felt, set in; and in its first stages it probably was strictly anti-vicious, but in its second merely a screen to hide vice from the pub lic gaze. This, in its turn, led to the good feeling a disgust for the bad, whic h in our age has developed into an inborn shame which condemns open vice , but tolerates, even endows it, when hidden. Open vice, unscreened and esotericised by religion, would have in the sequence of events led to an open feeling of disgust, for Nature never permits man to borrow without paying back, the general settlement day will always sooner or later arrive, and then a new epoch of time will be heralded in. Secret vice is the very worst form of vice; like a hidden gin we fall betwixt its jaws unawares. The cr ass and studied silence that mothers and fathers maintain over their childre n as regards all subjects of sex is probably responsible for fifty percent: a nd more of all the sexual crimes and sexual ills of the present day. When mankind has grasped the fact that its organs of reproduction are no more disgus ting than its organs of respiration, it will then have grasped a greater tr uth than all philosophies have ever promulgated, than all religions have ever revealed. “And they were both naked, the man and his wife , and were not ashamed”: THIS IS VIRTUE . “And the eyes of them both were ope ned, and they knew that they were naked”: THIS IS VICE ."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Know Thyself, Be Thyself, Honour Thyself, are the three greatest commandments we can follow.

We have already seen them rising upward from youth through the passion of maturity, concrete and abstract, earthly and spiritual; now let us turn about and descend the slippery road of lust, so essential to the basic knowledge of the good. Among the extraordinary antipathies and sympathies of the human mind, few are so startling as the frequent a ttraction of contraries.

Thus does this fearful tragedy end. Grue some with lust and cruelty, Ulric, a horrible perversion, overcome by the violence of his desires, a second Amnon, a second de Sade. Hi s ideal once at least partially pure, broke, as the truth burst on his ear, into a wild a nd fearful nightmare; and in his brutal fury we find that perhaps the Sadism of to-day is but an Avatar of those past days, when our progenitors, like some still existing savages, carried on their courtship with club and spear, and sole mnized their marriag e with rape and ravishment. Still one more phase of pe rverse love remains for us to study; the curious lust of man for woman as depicted in “Jezebel,” a curious manifestation of what is known as Masochism, which after the death of the object of its fascination, grows almost into the vampire desire of necrophilia. In “A Saint’s Damnation,” which is include d under the same c over, we see the power of love caught in the arms of restraint slowly smoulder into a burning desire: Passion to feed upon your shoulders bare, And pass the dewy twilight of our sin In the intolerable flames of hair. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

He, the prophet, goes to curse her – but loves her instead: For lo! she saw me, and beheld My trembling lips curled back to curse, Laughed with strong scorn, whose music knelled The empire of God’s universe. And on my haggard face upturned She spat! Ah God! how my cheek burned! Then as a man betrayed, and doomed Already, I arose and went, And wrestled with myself, consumed With passion for that sacrament Of shame. From that day unto this My cheek desires that hideous kiss.

Sleep shuns him, and his parched throat thirsts for the blood of her veins, “Aching with all the pangs of night”; his vision grows more monstrous, a horrible psychopathic mist dims his mind, and all the love he lavished on the body of the living woman turns to a lust for her cadaver: The spirit filled me.

We have passed through many fields, many groves, many wildernesses; we have crossed the pure snowy mountains of Chastity, and the boiling seas of Passion, losing ourselves in not a few of those intricate and unknown by- paths which lead to trackless wastes and gloomy abysms.

This mingling of the passionate and the chaste we find is the new ideal that Crowley flashes before our dazzled sight. Away with Mary, immaculate Mother of Christ: away with Messa lina, incestuous prophetess of Lust. Away! Away! To the West, to the Ea st, till they meet in some flaming region of equatorial fury, and flashing interfuse and interblend. Once again must a prophet of the Lord arise and wed a wife of whoredoms, who hath committed great whoredom, de parting from the Lord. Once again must Hosea expire on the crimson lips of Gomer, and from the womb of a harlot must the Christ be reborn a woman, wise, beau tiful, and young; who is both Circe and Diana, Isis and Aphr odite, in whose veins course all the fury of Medea, all the abominations of Canidia, who revels in the infernal rites of Sagana and Locust a, and yet is vestal and virgin; white as the driven snow, pure as a mountain rill.

So another league will be accomplishe d toward that city which is God. We have already seen in “The Mothe r’s Tragedy” and “The Fatal Force,” that the love of the mother, though it could not cause the shadow to travel backwards one degree on the face of th e dial, it at least clothed in a white garment of chastity, not only the amor ous music-hall artiste, but even the incestuous queen of Egypt. And though “J ezebel” did not love as they loved, her power of loving many e xonerated her want of love for one or a few. She like the Circe of old who turned the follo wers of Ulysses into swine, herself fell a victim entangled in those same meshes she had spun wherein to entrap her unwary fellows. “A woman who is without love,” writes Lévi, “absorbs and degrades all who come near he r; she who loves, on the other hand, diffuses enthusiasm, nobility, and life.”*"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"*The Doctrine of Transcendent Magic, p. 125. In her we see a contorted symbol of wifehood, whilst in the latter cases, and especially in “The Fatal Force,” we find that of Motherhood. The true wife must sacrifice her children before the sh rine of her lover, and the true mother must sacrifice her lover on the altar of her children. This is no paradox, no riddle, no twisting of words; for Crowle y offers us in the glittering chalice of Eternity the sacred blood of the Bull, th e Second Christ; and as the first, the Lamb of God, sprang from the immacula te womb of the Virgin-Mother, so shall this second incarnation spring blood-red from the snowy lips of the great Supernal Mother, androgynous , the Circe-Isis of the ages. In “Alice, an Adultery,” we see a wo man passionate in her love, strenuous in her affection, yet in the end failing by abandoning her lover for her children. Not so, however, in “Rosa Inferni,” wher ein we feel, as we read, a ferocity of passion which burns into us like a hail of molten glass; Aha! the veil is riven!

Such is religion! Why, then, has man ever sought this Mo loch of his nights, shedding o’er it his own blood, and drenching it with that of others, if it prove but an incubus of sorrow and despair? Firstly, b ecause most men are fools; secondly, because those who are not are knaves.

If we could be optimistic enough to believe in a (semi-)omnipotent power (pure omnipotency is anachronistic), we should believe this malady were inflicted on man as are the measles, th e croup, and the chicken-pox, so as to stimulate romance, and retard that ultimate uninteresting state perfection. This not being so, we can only suggest that being descended from the flat- nosed simiæ , besides being generally flat a ll round, man must have lost his wits with his tail, both being now exce edingly rudimentary.

Not being able to walk on his head, with his feet in the air, he, however, did and continues to do his best to carry what remains of his fungoid organ of thought as low as he possibly can, his desires in his stomach, and his thoughts in the vicinity of his prostate gland. There was a time when man did not know how to cook his dinner; we sincerely hope there will be a time when he ceases to cook his thoughts, but that time, in spite of science and art, is in the far here-after. Some people labour under the idea that a generation or two hence the world will be sprawling at the feet of Reason instead of those of God. Possibly, yet God is still far from being a centenarian , and our heavenly Father bids well to rival our earthly Parr; but as long as we sprawl, what matters it what we sprawl before, if it be the shin-bone of an ass, or the pineal gland of our wretched imagination? Whatever man has touched he has spoilt: one day he was struck with the mystic poetry of the waves, and he promptly hocussed slimy monsters from out the deep; gazing on his lithe and winsome daughter, he held her head under the green flood to satiate the rapacity of the offspring of his deluded imagination, who (he j udged) appreciated his dinner, as well as he did himself. Having devised re ligion, he by degrees fell into such excesses of worship, that religion bid well to exterminate his whole wretched race; thereupon he disclosed sc ience, which, when it has destroyed his former hobby, will in its turn run ri ot over all, till it also becomes such a pest, that it too, will have to give wa y to something bette r. Never contented, man ultimately finds that his double collection of manna rots. What the end will be no one knows, and few care; that we shall ever reach a state verging on perfection is most improbable; man could not stand it for long unless his worldly span were one of unambitious affluence, and his heavenly one of spasmodic sensuality and forgetfulness. To have plenty of money and no ambitions, to eat like a hog, sleep like a hog, and to breed like a hog; to be in a perpetual state of priapism, and to fall into slumbersome forgetfulness just when the pleasant is beginning to pall, and then to wake again to all the fury of desire. These two states, if we care fully dissect the corpse of religion, we shall find to lie at its basic foundation."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"On turning now to the works before us , we find traced therein an elaborate system rising from the fear of primitive man to the veneration of his present- day offspring. Fear, the basal foundatio n of all gods, found a subtle soil in Ignorance; Ignorance reacted on God, producing Supers tition; Superstition, Cruelty; Cruelty, all the tigerish longings of the day and the hoggish gratifications of the night. Pessimism is necessarily the foundati on of all religion; for if man were normally optimistic he would not have c onceived such a hierarchy of tyrants as that of his gods. The man who former ly cut himself with flints before a lump of stone or clay, is in no way more foolish than he who prays to an omnipotent conception; the former was jealous and exacting, and so is the latter, the former a thing, the latter an idea, and both an ideal. This evolution is very vividly de-scribed in th e poem entitled “The Growth of God”: Fear grows, and torment; and distracted pain Must from sheer agony some respite find; When some half-madde ned miserable brain Projects a god in his detesting mind. A god who made him – to the core all evil, In his own image – and a God of Terror; A vast foul nightmare, an impending devil; Compact of darkness, infamy, and error. Some bestial woman, beaten by her mates, In utter fear broke down the bar of reason; Shrieked, crawled to die; delirium abates By some good chance her terror in its season, Her ravings picture the cessation of Such life as she had known: her mind conceives A God of Mercy, Happiness and Love; Reverses life and fact: and so believes.* *The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 179.

Another juggle to elude fate is sacrifi ce. Sacrifice and pray er have ever run in harness together under the whistling of the priestly lash, “I will brain you if you refuse to render tri bute to me,” said the primitive chief to his primitive neighbour; “I will put you in jail if you won’t pay me your taxes,” says the modern government to the modern citizen. And as religion could not possibly restrain her octopus tentacles of cupidity from the game of grab, she also hisses, “Pray to G od and he will tie a knot in his bandana and perhaps remember it some day; but above all, sacrifice to me, or by Jove! I will sacrifice you:” and the fool, even in hi s folly, thought it we re better to lose his wits than his brains, and his turnip s than his turnip; so he dug and he dug, and he slew and he slew, religion growing fatter and fatter, spawning churches and breeding sects, till unfor tunate man found himself so hedged in by the spiritual, that in order to main tain his life in this world he had to acknowledge the Church’s supreme author ity, and grovel be fore her in the dust of degradation. Crowle y gives a curious example of this growth, and the ultimate sameness of all religions in that gruesome and weird drama, “The God-Eater.” Maurya the sister of Criosda says: Criosda, ever the same!

A fitting cry indeed to herald us into the pustulous domains of Jahveh and his murdered Son. In dealing with the Christian faith , Aleister Crowley by no means goes simply baldheaded for it like the unread secularist of the sixpenny platform; for, we find a distinct growth from a reverential regard towards its founder, to a satirical disregard for him, and his final dismissal in a jest. Such a mental progression is only natural; fr om the sublime irrationality of a de Kempis the student will almost inev itably, even unwittingly, pass through the adulations of a Renan, before he assumes the biting satire of a Saladin, or the poetic iconoclasm of a Swinburne. Christ, firstly, as the Son of God, is divine, omnipotent, in fact he is God; secondly, as the Son of Man, is noble, generous, lovable, in fact, man; but, thirdly, as the offspring of the carna lities of a Byzantine mob, which is the true Christ of history, he assumes a vampire form, a horror fed on the blood of children, the virility of youths, th e chastity of maidens. Hardly a single evil of the present day, if traced back a few hundred years, and frequently not half so long as that, but finds its birth in some corruption practised by the Harlot of the seven hills, or the Monste r of the six wives. It is only necessary to study such works as those of Buckle or Draper, of Wh ite or Stewart Ross, or better still, if time permits, those of ecclesiastical historians, written by the pens of divines, to become awar e of the appalling gloom that was cast over the splendour that was Greece, and the grandeur that was Rome, in that dismal night of a thousand years whic h lapped the Western world in a sea of blood and tears. Ignorance crushed the mind of Europe, as a hammer of lead, from the time that Constantine – tyrant , murderer, and debauchee – threw in his lot with the yelping mob of Consta ntinople.

In the earlier poems of Crowley, we find not only a reverential handling of the Christ idea, but an almost orthodo x adoration for the Christ Himself. In the last two verses of “Aceldama” th is is strongly brought out. “Thy love will stand while ocean winds endure”; and again, “Here I abandon all myself to thee.”*1. In “Songs of the Spir it” we find this veneration acutely portrayed, and the Christ as depicted in “The Goad” closely resembles the one as described in “The Farewell of Paracelsus to Aprile.” Here is a passage from each: I contemplate the wound Stabbed in the flanks of my dear silver Christ. He hangs in anguish there; the crown of thorns Pierces that palest brow; the nails drip blood; There is the wound; no Mary by Him mourns, There is no John beside the cruel wood; I am alone to kiss the silver lips; I rend my clothing for the temple veil; My heart’s black night mu st act the sun’s eclipse; My groans must play the earthquake...*2.

The glamour of enthusiastic and unsuspecting youth soon disappears to be swallowed up in the reality of a maturer understanding: He took the universe on trust; He reconciled the world below With that above; rolled eloquence Steel-tired o’er reason’s “why?” and “whence?” Discarded all proportion just, And thundered in our ears “I know,” And bellowed in our brains “ye must.”* *The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 181. In “Why Jesus Wept” our eyes are startled with the following horrid blasphemy, “The badger Jesu s skulketh in his holt,” *1. which, after all, is not a quarter so blasphemous as to s uppose that Jesus, the Son of God, the Very God, resides in a lo af and a bottle, as the Plymouth brethren did in the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"same satire – vide scene xiii.

Christ was to a great extent devoid of pity, and a little further on in the same poem, “A scension Day,” that he was but a cantankerous divider and obstreperous upstart: Give me omnipotence? . . . . . . . . . . . . To call me God – I would exert That power to heal creation’s hurt; Not to divide my devotees From those who scorned me to the close: A worm, a fire, a thirst for these; A harp-resounding heaven for those!* *The Sword of Song, Ascension Day, vol. ii, p. 158. Concerning the mother of the eternal God, Crowley has little to tell us, and the Blessed Virgin’s affaire du cœur with the amiable Gabriel is but touched on for a moment: “Fear nothing, Mary! All is well! I am the angel Gabriel.” She bared her right breast; (query why?)* *The Sword of Song, Pentecost, p. 60; vol. ii, p. 182. According to Al Beidâwi, Gabriel blew in to the bosom of Mary’s shift, which he opened with his fingers, and his breath reaching her womb, caused the conception. It may also be remembered that the Span ish mare, of Silius Italicus was similarly impregnated by a certain gas or spirit in the atmosphere. etc., etc., vide Koran.

How God being Almi ghty as well as Beneficent can tolerate such a world of suffering as ours for one minute passes all understanding. The God idea in its infancy, as we have already seen, was the child of ignorance and revenge, and Ja hveh, in his turn, is but an emanation of this world idea, no better than the rest: Baal and Jehovah, Ashtoreth And Chemosh and these Elohim, Life’s panders in the brothel. Death! Cloudy imaginings, a dream Built lip of fear and words and woe. All, all my soul must overthrow.”* *Ahab, vol. ii, p. 123. Crowley further writes: Nor can I see what sort of gain God finds in this creating pain.* *The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 172. But man the father of God did, for he was naturally bloodthirsty, avaricious, and cruel, and man to-day is but a ven eered representative of his forefathers, still suppliant at the feet of the phallic Jahveh: That man to-day should not be weaned Of worshipping so foul a fiend In presence of the living Sun.* *The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 177.

Leaving now these satirical poems for other works of Crowley’s, we shall find a deep, yet in no way less, intens e hatred for the sham ideal of all religions. In “Jephthah” we listen to Jephthah praying to Jehovah, god of hosts, for victory over the Ammonites, not-withstanding the fact that should victory be his lot a general violati on of all the virgins of Ammon was to follow: And turn their own devouring blade On city fired and violate maid,* *Jephthah, vol. i, p. 74. Chemosh was probably no whit better th an Jahveh, and Jephthah has almost as firm a belief in the former as in th e latter.* In fact, all were as the ground from which they had sprung and on which they grew. *Jephthah, vol. i, p. 76. In “The Triumph of Man,” a magnifi cent poem in heroic verse, Crowley unfurls the oriflamme of Reason agains t the bunting of God, leading us on from the realms of gloating anthropopha gi to the “magical brotherhood of kings.” The absolute crown and kingdom of desire, the one God sealed in the seas and betokened in the wi nds. “The Spirit of Mankind!” Before the darkness, earlier than being, When yet thought was not, shapeless and unseeing, Made misbegotten of deity on death, There brooded on the waters the strange breath Of an incarnate hatred.

The sacred pledge of the Rosicrucians was: “Man is God and Son of God, and there is no other God but Man.” Such is Aleister Crowley’s magnificen t contempt for the God ideals of man, and the Christ ideals of a demented mob. That Christianity has been for the greater part of fifteen hundred years an immense power, few can deny; that it has been a power of good, few will deny, though not a few would like to; that it has been a dragonading power of harm few will asse rt, and still fewer are aware of; for it has ever been the cr aft of the Christian Church to pass off on her paramours her worn-out old body as that of untasted virginity. The Catholic Church, the harlot of the seven hills, comes in for sparse mercy. In Tannhäuser we find the head of this infallible and august body of swindlers mocked as a mountebank, and his power as a “barren staff.”*1. In “Ascension Day” the whole Christia n Church as a lie, “abortion and iniquity,”*2. whose soldiers are no ardent warriors in triple steel, but loathly and disgusting worms,*3. who only show fight when cornered and not always then – “speared wild cats bravely spit.”*4. Neither does Crowley spare that anachronism, Present-day Ch ristianity, which fondly imagines it has succeeded in solving the problem of how to sit on two sides of the fence at one and the same time, to offer Ch rist to the simple-minded with the one hand and drain their pockets with the other. Amenna tep’s description of the pathic Ratoum in “The Fatal Force” may fitly be quoted here as an apt description of modern-day Christianity: Her power is gone, a nd we behold her go, Haggard and weary, thr ough the palace courts And through the temple, lusting for strange loves And horrible things, and thirsting for new steam"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Of thickening blood upon her altar steps.

It reads as follows: But – had it not been for the Garter, I might never have seen the Star. In it we find the sublime maxim, almost universal, which has been postulated by all the greatest ethical c odes of the world. It is the moral prototype, the Favashi of the Zoroas trian, the Tree of Knowledge of Babylonia and Genesis, the Light and Darkness of Isaiah, the Yakheen and Boaz of Solomon, the Unique Athanor of the Qabalist, the Balance of Hegel; the polarity of the worlds, the great cen tripetal and centrifugal forces, the harmony of the spheres, the path of the stars, the life of the universe. Without Vice there can be no Virtue, w ithout Virtue there can be no Vice. Without the one, the other becomes absolutely incomprehensible, and beyond our judgement. Hege l held: “that a thing can only arise through its opposite,” and this idea was also he ld by the Qabalists. Deity created good and evil; and both are absolutely necessa ry to the existence of each other. Further, the Qabalist does not even recognize their independence as two opposing powers, but as one under th e one Supreme Deity; the external visible matter world of evil and darkne ss, and the internal spiritual higher world of Goodness and Light, beneficen t and malevolent as the ancient gods of Babylonia. The unique Athanor of philosophic and moral alchemy was the transmutation of darkness into light. “ Quand l’homme grandit Dieu s’éleve ” – it was but a reconstruction of th e same idea as held in Exodus, xxxiii, Moses was unable to look at G od face to face; it was also the same idea as held by Charles Darw in – the theory of Evolution.

It was Satan, the Lucifer of Milton, the Devil of Blake, and the Serpent of Genesis, who was the author of Wisdom.* * cwdn same as hycm And the serpent said unto the wo man, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye sha ll be as gods, knowing go od and evil. —Gen. iii, 4, 5. It was only by casting off God, and breaking away from the essentially bestial quality of unreason, that man paradoxically assumed Godhood. Eliphas Lévi in one of his unpublished letters wrote, “The riddle of the sphinx has two answers which are true onl y in a third. ‘The first is God, the second is man, and the third Man-God.’’’ This is but the overman of the Egoistical philosophy of Nietzsche. Hermes struck a higher chord when he said: “To create God, is to accomplish our own creation, to make ourselves independent, impassible, and immortal.” Blake demonstrated the at-oneness of Good and Evil very clearly in “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.” “I tell you no virtue can exist without breaking these ten commandments,” he says, referring to the Decalogue. Further back in his “Proverbs of Hell,” he writes: You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough. The pride of the peacock is the glory of God. The lust of the goat is the bounty of God. The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God. The nakedness of woman is the work of God. For everything that lives is Holy. In Samuel Butler’s “Erewhon” we find much the same idea in the following couplet."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"He who sins aught sins more than he ought, But he who sins naught, has much to be taught. Blake further writes in “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell”: A man carried a monkey about fo r a show, and because he was a little wiser than the monkey, grew vain, and conceived himself as much wiser than seven men. It is so with Swedenborg: he shows the folly of churches and exposes hypocr ites, till he imagines that all are religious and himself the single one on earth that ever broke a net. Now hear a plain fact: Swed enborg has not written one new truth. Now hear another: he has written all the old falsehoods. And now hear the reason: He c onversed with Angels who are all religious, and conversed not with the Devils who all hate religion... Goethe, in Faust, also depicted this same moral idea, and most religions have experienced this unity of Virtue and Vice; the early Christians applauded it, and even now in Christian Churches is still sung the beautiful hymn: Nearer, my God, to thee, Nearer to thee, E’en though it be a cross That raiseth me! Still all my song shall be Nearer, my God, to thee, Nearer to thee. To raise oneself through the vicious a nd the virtuous, to reside, as Adonis did, six months with Proserpine, and si x with Venus, to be as day and night, winter and summer, is no ea sy path to tread; and if it be necessary for the initiate to gaze on the back parts of Jahveh, it is, however, most certainly not necessary for him to kiss the hind quarter s of the goat of Mendes, or to revel in the secret orgies of the Agapae; for the tempting of man is but the tempering of the metal.* *Yet the virtue of one man may be the vice of another."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The flower which springs from the dunghi ll assimilates into itself particles of matter, transforming them into th e ruby of the poppy and the sapphire of the cornflower; so with us, it is synthetically that we rise, and not analytically.

The Arcanum of Solomon is represented by the two pillars of the temple, Yakheen and Boaz, the two forces, th e white and the black; separate and contrary, yet in their polarity they ar e uniform, equilibrating their unity. The philosopher’s stone, as Hermes declar ed, consisted in separating the ethereal from that which was gross. Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire, the ethereal from the gross, gently, but with great industry. It ascends from earth to heav en, and again it comes down from heaven to earth, and it is invested with the potency of superior and inferior things. Thou wilt possess by this means the glory of the whole world, and all darkness will depart from thee. It is the strong power of every power, for it will overcome all things subtle and penetrate all things solid. It is thus that the world was created.* *Hermes. Tannhäuser also separate d the higher from the lower self, the good from the evil. Christ also attempted the same course, not living alone for either good or bad, but for the whole, as Jelálá deen sang, “I am the song and singer,” etc., the surest centre of immortality ly ing in the whole, and not in the part. The Qabalist compared the wicked with the excrement of the great human body, a necessary vivific secretion, a nd not a poison to the living organism. Waite tells us: “These excr etions also serve as a manure to the earth, which brings forth fruits to nourish the body; t hus death reverts always to life, and evil itself serves for the renewal and nourishment of good.”*1. The most important of all the arcana of the Magnum opus was the transformation of darkness into light. Again, we have the white and black triangles, the unique Athanor of moral alchemy, the transm utation of darkness into light. “The stone becomes a plant, the plant an animal, the animal a man, and man greatens into Deity.”*2. *1.

Many are the tracks and by-paths of life which lead over the mountains, the swamps, the forests of existence to that great road, the road of the Soul. From the supernal flights of Idealis m, we now find Crowley in the most infernal depths of realism strivi ng through a sea of blood towards that flaming pentacle which flares on the di m horizon of Hope. All is night, yet all is expectation; herculean is the task, yet the heart is that of a Titan. Blake saw that “Prisons are built with stone s of Law; brothels with bricks of Religion,” and so does Crowle y. Both in their sagac ity perceive that the one great crime is that of exclusivene ss. The Christian failing to see this, worshipped the masculine power of wisdom and neglected the feminine power of Intelligence, his God was as th e God of most religions a veritable He-God, therein lay his fault; the onl y philosophy perhaps that grasped the truth was that of the Qabala. The mi croprosopus was neither masculine nor feminine, but androgynous; and it was left for William Postel to utter one of the greatest world truths when he said , “The Word has i ndeed become man, but not until the Word has become woman will the world be saved.” It is this that Crowley sets vividly out before us in his following ethical philosophy. “To behold sin in its naked Deformity, is the most certain method to oblige us to love Virtue,” such is to be re ad in the prefatory note of a curious little volume to be found in the British Museum library under the attractive title of “The prostitution of Quality or Adultery à-la-mode .” It was through the Garter that in the end the Star was seen, in other words it was through the intimate knowledge of the lewd, bad a nd vicious, that the tender weeping heart was discovered; the rough matr ix contained a gem of surpassing beauty, the horny shell a pearl of perfect loveliness. Charicles had to tread the thorny path before he won his Arch ais, and so must we, before we can win knowledge, weep many bitter tears.

The mediaeval spiritualism of “Paracelsus” is curiously modernized, if we may use so crude a word, in the mystic al poem ”Aceldama.” The strife in the former from the kingdom to the crown, in the latter seems to be that of Vice towards Virtue, and though quite one of Crowley’s earlier poems, it is, however, one of his most interesting and attractive, and this is how I interpret it. A soul standing in the lupanar of life, aspiring to grasp the mystic riddle from the chilly lips of the eternal sphinx, salutes us, as we open this frail little volume. Our bodies are not burst as under as was that of Judas, but our souls are reft and rent, and in the e nd know not God from Satan, or which of these twain have won. “All the dream is wrought a spider-tapestry” yet the soul stands on the blood-red field of Aceldama: II. ...whose red banners beat Their radiant fire Into my shrivelled head, to wither Love’s desire?* *Aceldama, vol. i, p. 2.

In death is found release, freedom fro m desire, which fools alone reject. In the spiritual contemplation of life the slags of existence fall to the bottom of the burning furnace of the human soul; the power of empire and glory is shattered, “The gol den image with the feet of clay,” and the marred vessels of the (All)-mighty potter are cast out side, from the wheel of Fate – why contemplate what is so unprofitable and useless? Yet in this mysticism which is more intrinsically of the East, we find an intricate web of Egotism tangled with the utilitarianism of the West; for it seems on reading further that it is not in mere abstraction of the real, but rather in the total absorp tion of the real, that the Nirvana of bliss is to be arrived at.

It is only when we lose the cherishe d present, that it looms up through the mist of time as a glorious past; and it is only when we have lost the body of corruption, that its soul rises sublim e purifying all; our personality purified by death the great Time Soul lies cradle d in our own as the four lips of two lovers are in their bridal kiss. Alone by trampling life’s grapes do we gain the vintage of the Soul, the Med ean draught of rejuvenescence.

Thus in this cup which Aleister Crowle y offers us, we find that to sip the honey of Virtue is to quaff the wormw ood of Vice; they are one, and there must be no comparison. Outside our mi nds exists neither one nor the other, alone there is Power, Eastwards it verges towards Virtue, Westwards towards Vice – Heaven and Hell – ye t in neither is there vitality, for absolutes are without change. Our lives are vital because of the mingling of many dregs; and as in the death of these we can alone check vitality or change, so also in that greater Death can we alone solve the mystery of pure being. Virtue and Vice they are one, being formless and eternal without time or number; for whilst we live death is not, and the purities of state cannot be. We live in a land of mingled cloud and flame, on the marge of the kingdoms of the Positive and the Transcende nt, all is as a seething cauldron of finalities; ever boiling up to vanish in the inane.

ALL philosophies when ultimately reduced to their simplest terms fall either under the subjective or objective syst ems of thought.*2. The former is ontologic, the latter empiric: the firs t descends from fiction, whilst the second rises from fact; both, paradoxical as it may seem, are at one and the same time contradictory and identical , merging into a perfect unity, not in the realms of a spiritual or material monism, but in those of a Hylo-Idealistic philosophy, which is A gnostic, and from thence into a Self-Illuminism which baffles definition. *1. Argument: This chapter attempts to s how how all philosophies may be equated in corresponding terms of each other; and how th e philosophic principles of Berkeley and Hume, combined, form what may be known as the philosophical theme of Crowleyanity, in which it is demonstrated how all syst ems are inwardly mystically identical, and outwardly sceptically diverse. Further, how by the study of Berkeley, Hume, and Kant, taken unitedly or separately, the conclusion whic h is arrived at is, th at the Reason alone is inadequate to solve the Great Problem; fo r ultimately all systems based on a Rational foundation arrive at an inscrutable myster y – ”God,” “A Something,” “An à priori,” beyond which they cannot penetrate. Where Agnosticism and Scientific Buddhism end, Crowleyanity begins. By Qabalistically tack ling the question, it proposes a Future to all Rational Philosophies, thereby becoming a mystical theurgy, whereby the difficulties set in motion by the conceptions of “Infinite” an d ”Eternal” are overcome by the annihilation of Time and Space, and the reduction of all rati onal terms to an absolu te inertia in zero. From here Crowleyanity becoming purely mys tical becomes symbolic, leading those who follow into the Kingdom of the Adepts; a nd finally showing how the keynote of all mystical systems of either East or West, is to be found in Ecstasy; and how the former, arriving at this sublime stat e by purely mechanical methods, are not so suitable to those Western nations as their own poetic mysticis m, as found in the divine works of the Christian Fathers, the Alchymistic Philosophe rs, and the Mystical Poets of Ancient and Modern times. *2. There is an old saying, “All men are bor n either Platonists or Aristotelians.” For many centuries now, European t hought has been labouring under the damnosa hereditas of foregone conclusions. And as religion in the attempt to anthropomorphise power, through the medium of dialectic symbols, lost all footing and plunged headlong into the pandemoniac majesty of Deity, so philosophy, losing all grip of reality by clutching the illusive realism of its own creative faculties, was itself whir led into that furnace of hereditary"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"prejudice, and educational bias, from out of which it has flowed a mass of molten and subservient acquiescence. Lo st in the axiomatic whirlpools of egotistical conceit, it has been cast up once again on the shores of unknowable despair, a veritable mass of philosophic pig-iron, of no further use than that of acting as ballast to the good ship which is to carry us across the turbid ocean of raging Eclectics. Crowley is more than a new-born Dionys us, he is more than a Blake, a Rabelais or a Heine; for he stands be fore us as some priest of Apollo, hovering ‘twixt the misty blue of the heavens, and the more certain purple of the vast waters of the deep. Before the name of That which is beyond life and death, beyond matter and energy, beyond the human and the mortal; he stands, holding before us as a standard, the homologue of the Labarum of old, “ In hoc signo vinces... Non timendum est Veritate duce .” In order to cut a long story short, it may be assumed that so-called modern philosophy finds its founder in the Fre nch philosopher Desc artes; for it was he who started to unravel the Penel ope web of tangled philosophic thought, which had lain sleeping for a thousand years or more upon the sterile shelf of Christian impotence. His theories of “Innate ideas” raised the anger of Locke, the disciple of Aristotle and Bacon. Revolting from the cognito ergo sum of Descartes, he compared the mind to a tabula rasa , on which he in his turn wrote an equal absurdity in the words: nihil est in intellectu quod non antea fuerit in sensu . Leibnitz in his day, perceiving the weakness in this axiom, extended its phraseology, but in no way its meaning, by adding Excipi nisi ipse intellectus . This weakness in Locke’s syst em became only too apparent to his followers; and Berkele y, as well as Hume, and later still Kant himself, travelling by slightly different road s, ultimately arrived at the same destination: “we cannot go beyond experience.” In the first half of the last century Kant’s immediate successors, such as Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, swinging round this central point of attraction, though viewing it from different posit ions, ultimately, like moths round a candle, fell spluttering into the socket , burnt by that same flame they were attempting to explain away. Neverthele ss, though at first their Narcissus-like self-worship may seem to have be en productive of little good, at least, however, it has brought to blossom one i rrefragable and irrefutable fact, and that is: that in some appare ntly unknown plane, sensation can be other than"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"subjective, i.e. , in the subject, in other words, that subjective creation can outstep its own creator and vice versa .

To the uninitiated this matter must fo r the present remain dark, and though at first the neophyte may think that the fo llowing solution, which I trust I shall be able in some little way to explain, is but one on a similar footing to that as set forward by those supernatur alists who dogmatize concerning credo quia absurdum , I must bid him now at the very outset remember, that ”except he become as a little child, he can in no way enter into the kingdom of heaven”; and further, becoming as a little child it must be remembered that it is as child-like to grasp at that which alone can be solved ”in the alembic of the heart, and through the athanor of afflic tion,” as it is for a child to grasp a loaded gun, wotting not of its subtle machinery. For a man becoming as a child, may, like that child which he has become, play with that loaded weapon, nurse that loaded weapon, go to bed with that loaded weapon, expecting nothing of so innocent a toy; and then one day as he presses his fetish fondly to his heart, there is a deaf ening crash; and that child who was once a man, flashes up through the golde n gates of Paradise, or is hurled headlong down to Hell.

The state of illumination above menti oned is by no means an easy one to attain to, and the study of philosophy alone helps us, if we follow it under the shaded light of a critical sceptic ism; for as a chemist reduces his compounds to their component parts, and then to their elementary conditions; so must we dissect all philosophic arguments which rise up antagonistic to our true selves – that is in harmony with our false selves –"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"seducing our sense to pluck the fruit whic h is pleasant to the eye, or inducing our understanding in despair, to cas t itself down from the pinnacle of the temple into that abyss below, which is the world.

And as there ar e many by-ways, corridors, and blind alleys in this great labyrinth of Parnassus, so in this clue, which has been given us, we shall find many twisted thread s, yet all of one fibre, which will lead us, the weary wanderers in the mysteries, to th at certain and blissful kingdom which shall be our beginning. Kant has said, the business of all philo sophy is to answer the question ”What can I know?” Huxley, perhaps the astute st philosopher since the days of the"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"magus of Königsberg, observes that it is impossible to answer the question “What can I know?” unless in the first place there is a clear understanding of what is meant by knowledge, and in orde r to answer this question, “we must have recourse to that investigati on of mental phenomena, the results of which are embodied in the science of psychology.”* But the true crux of all philosophic arguments lies, as we hope shortly to show, in a still deeper problem than this, namely: “What is the ’I‘ which causes us to know?” For surely it is but common-sense to first inquire of the engineer how the engine is worked, instead of blundering in a ttempts to do so for ourselves, without knowledge, or even the necessary instruc tion as to the subtle adjustment of the different parts. And it is on account of the want of this ”I“ that all science resting on the inquiry “What do I know?” without the “I” being analytically disclosed, must, and does, rest upon knowledge purely accidental or hypothetical. *Huxley’s Essay on Hume, p. 59. It is quite as possible for hypotheti cal arguments to be rightly and wrongly applied, as it is for mechanical tools. A pick-axe is a most useful implement in levelling a road, and equally a most useless one in mending a watch; so also with hypothetical arguments, a subtle and illumina ted mystic will discard such mean scaffolding, or at l east attain such a perfection in the art of constructing his temple of the Holy Ghost as in time to be able to do without such mental timb er. Such scaffold poles are those which support and buttress up the frail edifice of scienc e on the mud of ignorance, in which it and its superstructure w ill eventually be engulfed; for its whole foundation reposes upon the unequilibrated illusions of the mind, which so long as their influences remain unbalanced, stand as impediments in the way of the inward development of the human race.* And as the gigantic edifice of the Christian Church was the child of th e neuropathic mystagogues of the dark ages of religion, so now the colossa l fabric of Scien tific Utilitarianism, offspring of a distorted and epileptic steam-mania, has bemerded us with its panting slime, and wound us tight in the arachnoid meshes of its kakodemoniacal web, until we st and before ourselves, no longer homo sapiens , but alone, naked and unadorne d, a cinder-sprinkled, soot- besmeared, sp ider-legged, homo ridiculissimus ! *Science here as a method is not attacked.

Crowley is never tired of ur ging a scientific study or the conditions of illumination as the one hope of mastering the subject. Periodically as the adepts soar above vulgar appreciation, and when vulgar understanding has, swine-like, trodden thei r pearls of wisdom back into the mud of its own sty, a great wave of ma terialism sweeps over the face of the globe. This system of thought, built on the illusive phantasmagoria of the mind, found in the West a master-mind to mould it into shape, in the personality of Democritus of Abdera ; and from the day when that sage materialized the creations of his brain to that of Büchner and the present-day mud-larks, it has formed the stumbling- block to nearly every great thinker, and the veritable pus puriens of the common mind. However, out of the slough grew, as must always happen, a subtle plant; and in the form of Newton, whose scientific demonstra tion of auto-kineticism, many ages previously adumbrated by Empedocles and Democritus, gave the death-blow to that Empiricism, which may be typifi ed in Locke’s assertion that ”motion and figure are really in the manna,” to which Berkeley attributed a purely mental existence; for he asserts agai n and again that the only substantial existence is the hypothetical substratum of mind, i.e. , spirit.* And this, as Huxley himself states, if pushed to its logical extreme, passes into pantheism pure and simple; and thus through obj ecting to Locke’s primary qualities as things in themselves, Berkeley return s, through the objection, back to the causa sui , or better, ratio sui of Spinoza, the spir itual twin of Locke. *All these philosophers end in the same quandary as the old gentleman who with only one tooth in his mouth trie d to spike a pickled onion. I have taken some little troubl e to arrive at this one isolated conclusion, that the Realism of the scholastic philosopher s, the materialism of the classical and modern sages, and also, if we choose to extend our scheme, Nominalism, Conceptualism, Theism, Positivism, Spiritualism (Malebranche), Agnosticism (Spencer), all and one, w ith all the other isms, may, with the slightest trouble in th e world, be equated into corresponding terms of Berkeleyan Idea lism. And why? Because each individual master, each separate school, like the astronomer in the fable, whilst gazing at his own particular star, fell into the open ditch which yawned unperceived at his feet. And Berkeley: is he the Ultima Thule , the stone of the wise?

Let us now take an infinite series A,B,A,B,A,B. The question asked is: which is first, A or B? And the answ er depends entirely upon the direction of thought. Science will say that intelligen ce is last, and that matter slowly evolves into animal life; in fact, that matter (A) is first, and intelligence (B) is second. The idealists and sankhyâs w ill put intelligence (B) first, and the series will run B,A,B,A,B,A. Both, how ever, are indicating the same chain; but Crowley,* like the philosophers of the Vedanta, strides beyond both intellect and matter to find an “I“ ( purusha) or self, which is beyond all intellect, and of which intellect is but the borrowed light, as Patanjali says in one of his yoga aphorisms: “The seer is intelligence only, and though pure, sees through the colouring of the intellect.“ *This is the earlier Fichtean Crowley, t hough he has already passed through Schelling to Hegel, and grouped this triad in one, as it were Fichte in excelsis ; not the middle, who has called the triad “Schelling”; still less the la tter, who, perceiving th e antinomies of reason, dismisses alike the data and conclusions of all the sciences with an all-embracing scepticism, while he devotes life to the perf ecting of an instrument by whose aid we may eventually be able to make a fresh start. In “Pentecost,” Crowley writes: You know for me the soul is nought Save a new phantom in the thought, That thought itself impermanent, Save as a casual element With such another may combine To form now water and now wine; The element itself may be Changeless to all eternity, But compounds ever fluctuate With time or space or various state.

IDEALISM In the philosophy of Plato idealism took the shape of a strictly formal characteristic, there was nothing in itself, as Kant might have explained it, an idea however dating back long before eith er Plato or Kant, and to be first found in any degree of maturity in th e Upanishads of post-vedic India. Form was reality, and nothing else, it was th e sole and only essence. From such metaphysics rose numerous modified forms which may he roughly classed under the name of Spiritualism (Malebra nche). They asserted that matter objectively was illusion or maya, and th at the world problem could only be considered as a reality subjectively in the thoughts as “thinks,” in fact the world real was simply an elaboration of these ”thinks.” These spiritualistic philosophies stagnating for a time we re soon mystified by man’s inherent longing for the wonderful,* and developed into vari ous systems of Spiritism and Mysticism, both high and low. Of th e latter the most renowned, and in many ways the most profound, wa s the Philosophy of the Qabalah. *“The imagination of man is naturally sublime, deli ghted with whatever is remote and extraordinary, and running without control into the most distant parts of space and time in order to avoid the objects, which custom has rendered too familiar to it.” — An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding , Hume (Religion of Science Library), p. 172. The Qabalah, if it may be called a philosophy; for it was never synthetical, or concrete, being a conglomerated ma ss of ecstatic ideals and exalted desires, evolved in the mind of man as an attempt to grasp all possible quantities emanating from the Ain Soph, which in itself remained Zero. Turning now for a short time from the Mystic to the Idealistic philosophy, we find that though both are closely un ited, the former founds its system on man’s wondering ignorance in trying to link subject and object esoterically, whilst the latter builds up reality in mind perceptions, treating nothing as illusion but the reality of the materialists . Berkeley, when he declared in his"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"transcendental philosophy that esse=percipi was only in reality reiterating the idea held ages previously in “The Veil of Maya.” Kant threw more fuel on the Berkeleyan argument when he stated in his ”Critique of Pure Reason,” that we can have no positive knowledge whatsoever of “the thing in itself.” Since then this idea of th e subjectivity of reality has gained more ground under Hegel, and later in numerous works dealing directly or indirectly with Spiritual Monisms. Even in the middle of the eighteenth century, forty years after Berkeley had stimulated the dry bones of this problem into a vigorous existence, mate rialism waged but a losing, or at best an unprogressive war against it. Holb ach himself had to admit that, though he considered Berkeley’s arguments as sheer sophisms, they nevertheless remained unanswerable... Idealism ma y not be correct, neither may its intenser form Spiritualism; but so far as this argument is of value, neither may Realism nor Materialism; for both these philosophies have, as we have just seen, resolved themselves into an infinite chain of events, which may be expressed under the symbolization of A, B,A,B,A,B, the ulti mate issue being the triumph of Agnosticism. All the wisest from all ages with all th eir wisdom finally have had to utter ”We Know Not,” and write “ignoramus” across their life’s work. Yet is not this infallibly as it must be, if we se arch for an absolute truth by relative means; we cannot prove that it does not exist, any more than we can prove that it does; for if we dare to attemp t to tread so thorny a path with the utmost success the land we reach is but the land of Weissnichtwo. The world does not exist outside me. I am the world; but what am I? Herein lies the greatest of riddles. This question, this gigantic ”What? ” Crowley sets forth lucidly enough in “Pentecost” and ”Ascension Day.” He writes: To calculate one hour’s result I find surpassing difficult; One year’s effect, one moment’s cause; What mind could estimate such laws?

In the end our finite understandings burst like bubbles. The rampant positivism of to-day is so drunk on the spume of the oceanic knowledge of the deep, that it sees no further than the tip of its own glowing nose, upon which roseate point it hypno tises itself into a hypermnemonic state of “Knowallableness”; this, if not mo re so is certainly quite as fatuous a standpoint to hold as that of Spencer, in his philosophy of the “Unknowable.” Both are dogmatisms, a nd as such condemn the very object of their existence.

To clearly illuminate the Orphic progress through the Plutonic regions of Philosophy, it will be necessary, first of all to satisfy the three heads of the terrible offspring of Echidna’s womb, whose names ar e Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. BERKELEY Berkeley, that “God-illumined Adept,” *1. almost at the commencement of his introduction to “The Principles of Human Knowledge,” states: “Upon the whole, I am inclined to think that the far greater part, if not all, of those difficulties which have hitherto am used philosophers, and blocked up the way to knowledge, are entirely owing to our selves – that we have first raised a dust, and then complained we cannot see.”*2. And naturally to expect, Berkeley himself, though an Adept of a very high order, starting upwards through the clear atmosphere of the sky, clutched the very fire from the altar of God, and then in his descent to th e dusty plains of Earth, caused such a whirlwind to arise, that his immediat e successors, and even we who live two hundred years after that storm arose, s carce dare open our eyes for fear of being blinded. *1. Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 225. *2. P. 6. A mystic by nature and a priest by pr ofession, we must, in reviewing his bequests to knowledge, always rememb er how much of the one side to deduct from the other, should we wish to prove him either an Adept or a Bishop. But with such inborn predilec tion, and such outward assumption, it is easy to understand why it was that he threw the whole energy of his life into an attempt to refute the advanc ing scepticism latent in the works of Hobbes and Locke. He sa w, and seeing fought the many children which had sprung from the fertile womb of the Cart esian doctrine, of abstract general ideas and secondary qualities; which alone found birth in the powers of language, and in the delusion of word s. But behind the didactic Berkeley stands the mystic, that other Berk eley, whose knowledge has alone been attained by a very few; for he spoke with God face to face."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"“Could men but forbear to amuse them selves with words, we should, I believe, soon come to an agreement in this point... that the absolute existence of unthinking things are words without a meaning, or which include a contradiction.”* *The Principles of Human Knowledge, p. 43. Berkeley, as has only too often been repeated and too frequently misunderstood, did not deny the meaning of substance as taken in the vulgar sense – a combination of sensible qualities, and though it may be possible, he stated, “that solid, figured, movabl e substances may exist without the mind, corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies, yet how is it possible for us to know this? Either we mu st know it by sense or by reason... But what reason can induce us to believe the existence of bodies without the mind, from what we perceive.”*1. Th is point Crowley fully emphasizes in “Time” when he writes: “a thing is only real to us so far as it is known by us; even its Unknowability is a species of knowledge of it: and, by Savitri! when I say real to us , I say real absolutely, since all things lie to me in the radius of my sensorium. ‘To others’ is a vain phrase.”*2. And as it has already been shown in the chain A,B,A,B,A,B, it matte rs not if the Materialist chooses to place his finger on A, or the Idealist on B; so in the above, Berkeley annihilating the idea of a material subs tratum, at one and the same moment, unwittingly immolates his own cherishe d child on that same blade with which he has just sacrificed his foe. And, seeking to supplant the miserable huts of the materialist, Berkeley si milarly builds his gorgeous palaces on reason, perceiving not that the foundatio ns of both are the same, and that one like the other will crumble into dust be fore the blinding storm of dialectic dispute. *1. The Principles of Human Knowledge, p. 39. *2. Time, vol. ii, p. 269. Berkeley, in positing Esse=percipi , considered that he once and for all had overthrown scepticism, whic h he defined as – the di sbelief of the senses.*1. In “The Principles of Human Knowle dge,” he states: “Our knowledge of these (ideas) hath been very much obscured and confoun ded, and we have been led into very dangerous errors, by supposing a twofold existence of the objects of sense – the one intelligible or in the mind, the other real and without the mind; whereby unthinking*2. things are thought to have a"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"natural subsistence of their own dis tinct from being perceived by spirits. This... is the very root of Scepticis m... For how can it be known that the things which are perceived are c onformable to those which are not perceived, or exist without the mind.” *3. Shortly before arriving at this conclusion, he had already stated that as “the infinite divisibility of matter” was now universally allowed by th e most approved and considerable philosophers, hence it follows that ther e are an infinite number of parts in each particle of matter which are not perceived by sense. “...In proportion, therefore, as the sense is rendered mo re acute, it perceives a greater number of parts in the object, that is, the object appears greater, and its figure varies.”*4. In other words the Self of the Idealist as the Not-self of the Materialist, is purely maya, i.e. , motion. But a still more important contradiction creeps in here, and curious to say, the very monster Berkeley set out with lance in re st to overthrow, proves but a Quixotic windmill which sends our gallant knight rolling in the ve ry dust in which he had hoped to lay low the sceptical and monstrous gian t. Thus in the place of disproving scepticism he unconsciously cleared the way for the greatest of all sceptics – David Hume. *1. Time, vol. ii, p. 51. *2. Berkeley, throughout “The Principles,” as well as the “Dialogues,” overlooks the Newtonian law of gravity alt ogether, though he supposes that he himself is not the only thinking entity in the world, his arguments lead one to infer that he is. As an Idealist he proves that nothing can exist except in mind; then finding he has overlooked the question of God, as an Animist adds: th at all things, he himself incl uded, cannot exist except in the mind of some Divine Being, failing (perhaps pur posely) to see that such a Being was also but a figment of his mind. *3. Ibid . p. 79. *4. Ibid . p. 55. HUME Hume, at heart a thoroughgoing agnosti c and man of the world, saw the practical falsity of abstruse philoso phy, the conclusions of which were at once dissipated by the “feelings of our heart,” which reduced “the profound philosopher to a mere plebeian.” He fo rcibly asserts, that ideas of primary qualities are attained by abstraction – “an opinion which if we examine it accurately, we shall find to be unintelli gible, and even absurd.” He further agrees with Berkeley in stating that: “An extension that is neither tangible nor visible, cannot possibly be concei ved,” and that, “The mind has never"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"anything present to it but the perceptions, and cannot possibly reach any experience of their connexion with objects.”*1. And again that the “...universal and primary opinion of all men is soon destroyed by the slightest philosophy, whic h teaches us, that nothing can ever be present to the mind but an image or perception, a nd that the senses are only the inlets through which these images are conve yed, without being able to produce any immediate intercourse between the mind and the object.”*2. However, the great unknown waste of this “immed iate intercourse” Hume bravely sets out to explore. *1. An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, p.163. *2. Ibid . p. 161. As Berkeley had previously got hopele ssly bogged in the swamps of God, so Hume, avoiding the shore line, set out on the same quest by way of the desert of Scepticism, without the ch art of so divine a knowledge, but with the compass of a more certain directi on; nevertheless, s oon losing his way in the arid wilderness of doubt, he also le ft the great riddle unanswered, to leap voiceless midst the desert wind, and to dance songless ‘mongst his bleached and rattling bones. Furthe r on we shall see how Cr owley, setting out with both chart and compass, like a second Œdipus wrested th e secret from the age-worn lips of the Sphinx; for as he himself says: Eternal mockery is the real; Eternal falsehood, the ideal.* *Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 93. However, Hume arrives at a negative result of extraordinary worth. He took Newton’s second law of motion,* i.e. , of Cause and Effect, and wrote against it a colossal “WHY?” *Every change of motion is proportional to the force impressed, and is made in the direction of that force. Berkeley, as we saw above , arrived at the conclusion, that it was impossible to solve the question of relationship be tween the things which are perceived, and the things which are not perceived; and in the “Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous” he further ela borates this proposition. Hume by a slightly different road arrives at an exactly similar c onclusion, namely: how"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"is it possible to judge the relationship between cause and effect, or in other words the perceived and not perceived? “The first time a man saw the co mmunication of motion by impulse... (billiard balls)... what alte ration has happened to give rise to this new idea of connexion ? Nothing but that he now feels these events to be connected in his imagination...”* *An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, p. 78. Hume thus arrives at the conclusi on that cause and effect can only be inferred from each other, and never known. “Beyond the constant conjunction of similar objects, and the consequent inference from one to the other, we have no notion of any necessity or connexion.”* *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, p. 85. “Their (bodies) secret nature, and consequently all their effects and influence, may change, without any ch ange in their sensible qualities.

My practice, you say, refutes my doubts. But you mistake the purport of my question.

No reading, no inquiry has as yet been able to remove my difficulty, or give me satisfaction in a matter of such impor tance. Can I do better than propose the difficulty to the public, even though, perhaps, I have small hopes of obtaining a solution? We shall, at leas t, by these means, be sensible of our ignorance, if we do not augment our knowledge. “I must confess that a man is gu ilty of unpardonable arrogance who concludes, because an ar gument has escaped his own investigation, that therefore it does not really exist.”*1. And he continues further on: “And though he should be convinced that his understanding has no part in the operation, he would nevert heless continue in the sa me course of thinking. There is some other principle which determines him to form such a conclusion.”*2. *1. An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, pp. 37-38."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"*2.

We are now fairly on our road to Crow leyanity. Having left Berkeley in the dark, feeling on the dusty shelves of hi s reason for a flint and steel in the spirituality of God, whereby he ma y burn in twain the gordian knot into which he has tangled hi s understanding; we now find Hume, in a similar manner, groping for the handle of so me bricked-up door, which will lead him forth from the depths of that same night in which Berkeley has already lost his way. When Hume states: “he feel s events to be connected in his imagination”; he is only reiterating the words of Philonous, when he says: “I have a notion of Spirit, though I have not, strictly speaki ng, an idea of it. I do not perceive it as an idea, or by means of an idea, but know it by reflexion.” To which Hylas very properly replied: “Words ar e not to be used without a meaning. And, as there is no more meaning in spiritual Substance than in material Substance , the one is to be exploded as well as the other.” Philonous, in answering Hylas then asserts acquainta nce with that nature of the human soul which Hume declared to be inc onceivable. “How often must I repeat, that I know or am conscious of my own being; and that I myself am not my ideas, but somewhat else, a thinking ac tive principle, that perceives, knows, wills, and operates about ideas.”* *Three Dialogues, p. 95. This “human soul” of Hume, the “I myself” of Berkeley are synonymous terms; in fact, they are one with the “purusha” of the Yogins, and the “magical stone” of the philosophic alchymists. Hume arrives at the conclusion: “that there is a species of scepticism, antecedent to all study and philosophy, which is much inculcat ed by Des Cartes and others, as a sovereign preservative against e rror and precipitate judgement. It recommends an universal doubt, not only of all our former opinions and"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"principles, but also of our very facu lties, of whose veracity, say they, we must assure ourselves, by a chain of reasoning, deducted from some original principle which cannot possibly be fa llacious or deceitful.

For here is the chief and most confounding objection to excessive scepticism, that no durable good can ever result from it; while it remains in its full force and vigour. We need only ask such a sceptic, ‘ What his meaning is? And what he proposes by all these curious researches? ’ He is immediately at a loss, and knows not what to answer.” —P. 169. “When he awakes from his dream, he will be the first... to confess, that... mankind... must act and reason and believe; though they are not able, by their most diligent enquiry, to satisfy themselves concerning the foundation of these operations, or to remove the objections, which may be raised against them.” —P. 170."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"“As to your first question: (how can you conceive it possible that things should exist in God’s mind) I own I have properly no idea , either of God or any other Spirit; for these being active cannot be represented by things perfectly inert, as our own ideas are.” —P. 92. “For all the notion I have of God is obtained by reflecting on my own soul, heightening its powers, and removing its imperfections.

Such is the foundation of moral reasoning.” — P. 174."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"KANT On Hume’s despairing “something,” Kant builds his à priori , and though the detail of his criticism differs from that of Hume’s, in the main result it coincides, arriving at the same unl eapable ditch, the limitation of all knowledge regarding the reality of phenomena as revealed to us by our senses. Hume starting with the prop osition that ideas are copied from impressions ends in the unknown; Ber keley through a similar process declares bankruptcy in God: Kant does lik ewise, stating in his “Critic of pure Reason”; “All knowledge (touching an object of mere reason) can be communicated not logically but morally... I am morally certain... etc.” But what he means by the word “ morally ” he does not explain, postulating in place of an explanation an “ à priori certainty.” To Hu me’s scepticism he answers: the object is unknowable per se , the subject is also unknowable per se , because they both vary, consequen tly ontology is impossible. But the laws and forms of thoughts are univers al and irrefragable, and form an unalterable standard of certainty wh ereby knowledge may be increased. À priori laws are not derived from experi ence, but belong to the inherent structure of the mind. Kant then sets himself to answer the question: How are synthetic judgements à priori possible? And his answer is: Unless cognitions are synthetical they can a dd nothing to our previous knowledge, unless à priori they cannot be universal. Un less universal they cannot be apodictically true. Kant’s reasoning ru ns as follows: Firstly, there is a sensibility, a power of being affected by objects, a passive faculty; secondly, an understanding, a faculty recognizing th e affectations of the sensibility, this is active, and responds to stim ulation. The sensibility, however, has its laws, and to discover them, we must separate those which are multiple from those which are one. The objects are vari able, the passive functions of the mind remain invariable, the multiple he calls the material, the invariable he christens form – Space and Time. Space and Time are therefore the indisp ensable conditions of all sensation, and according to Kant are not deducib le from experience, consequently they are à priori . The understanding, similarly as the sensibility, possesses certain forms called judgements, of which ther e are four classes: “quantity, quality, relation, and modality.” These are the à priori categories of the understanding, and they are synthetic."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"This à priori (Crowleyanity affirms) is no i nnate intuition at all, in fact merely an abstraction from experience, and an equivalence of statement. It may be a postulation of our egoity, but it therefore need not necessarily be so for all other personalities, as it cannot be in any way demonstrated as final. Kant did not have the necessary knowle dge of taking into consideration the fact of inherited experiences, as Herb ert Spencer was able to do, so worked at a disadvantage, postulating an à priori in place of organised intuitions . CROWLEYANITY AND THE PROLEGOMENA To illustrate the infolding of Crowleya nity, it will be necessary here to run through Kant’s Prolegomena, reducing his arguments to the terms of this all embracing philosophy. (To aid the read er, I will place all criticisms of a purely Crowleyan savour in square brackets.*) *These are the words of Crowley, the student. Immanuel Kant finding his master Davi d Hume enmeshed in the negative net of an excessive Pyrrhonism, se t out to free him from the tangled conception of cause. To accomplish this end, and to avoid falling into the same entanglement of empirical uncer tainties (physical), groping about in the dark for some weapon which might enable him to free his unfortunate master, himself fell into the same meta physical pitfall, and contented himself by declaring his strangling senior as “fr ee.” In other words: “It (the source of metaphysical knowledge) cons ists, then, in knowledge à priori , that is, knowledge derived from pure understanding, pure reason” (p. 11).* [Then it is impossible and its extension zero; for the intension of reason and its forms are alike built up by experience, th at of the race (H. Spencer).] *Bohn’s edition of the Prolegomena. Having postulated metaphysical knowledge, Kant then proceeds to subdivide it into two headings: 1, Analytic; 2, Synthetic judgements; the first Crowley would identify with [verbal propositions ], the second with [real]. First Kant states: “All analytic judgements are based entirely on the principles of contradiction... and are... à priori ” (p. 13), e.g. , “Every body is extended,” ... “Nobody is unextended,” e.g., “Gold is a yellow metal.”"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"“Now, to know this, I require no fu rther experience beyond my conception of gold, which contains the proposition that this body is yellow and a metal” (p. 13). [But, answers Crow ley, what of the proposition “Gold is a trivalent base? None of these things are analytic . Thus gold must be reducible to the noumenon, and so disappear.] In the second proposition Kant sa ys: That though there are synthetic judgements à posteriori , “there are also others of an à priori certainty,” which “can never have their s ource solely... in the principle of contradiction” (p. 13). “ Judgements of experience are always synthetic. It would be absurd to found an analy tic judgement on experience” (p. 14). [Crowley at once answers, “All judge ments are founded on experience. This primary fallacy of à priori validity is clearly the root of the great follies which follow. 1+1=2 cannot be doubted, but it is a definition, and means nothing, being arbitrary. But 2+2=4 is a synthetic conception.] Similarly under this synthetic head ing, Kant tackles “Mathematical judgements, illustrating his conception of straight which has no reference to size, but only to quality, by defining “a straight line is the shortest between two points” [which is certainly untrue* : “Two straight lines cannot enclose a space,” is better; for in the definition which he gives, Kant does not seem to have grasped the true conception of “s traight.”] Hume, Kant states, severed pure mathematics from synthetic judgements à priori , and herein made a great mistake, as all mathematical j udgements he asserts are synthetic. [But is his dogmatism correct? Crowley would disagree.] *What relation is there between our concep tions of rectitude a nd length? None, till geometry informs us. [( a .) Mathematics is analytic, because a parabola is but a name, and all its qualities are directly deducible from its definitions, etc., etc., and therefore contained therein, though not seen. ( b .) Mathematics is based on racial experience, and even on individual l earning; only a few highly developed brains can apprehend its propositions . It may be doubted whether any synthetic judgement exists at all; fo r the moment it is made it becomes analytic. This is obvious of “A” and “E” propositions, and only not so of “I” and “O,” because the subject is impure.] Kant then rejecting metaphysics as a true science (p. 21), asserts, however with confidence, “that certain pure s ynthetic cognitions are really given à"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"priori , namely; pure mathema tics and pure natural sc ience... both... partly apodictically certain through mere Reas on.” [However he fails to quote any such proposition! And his “apodictic certainty” only means that the human mind is unable to transcend that li mitation. Thus me taphysics is a mere branch of psychology, for one thing; for another, every result obtained is merely a statement of limitation, a nd therefore every accession of knowledge is a vision of a new vista of ignorance. Summa scientia nihil scire , has yet another meaning.] Having then as he thought discovered an à priori basis to metaphysics, he places before his reader the crucial problem. “ How are synthetic propositions à priori possible ”? And at the very outset, assuming pure synthetic knowledge from the Reason as real (p. 22), attacks the problem. “How is it possible when a conception is given me, I can pass out of it, and connect it with another which is not c ontained in the former,” and explains the difficulty by assumed knowledge à priori , [Rendering Hume’s position now impregnable, thanks to ethnology, etc., etc.]; and then Kant asks, “ How is pure mathematics possible ”? [Again falling into the fallacy of supposing his own brain to be without a history, It is curious to note that Kant’s à priori is but a recasting of the old my th of Pallas, Wisdom, springing full- armed from the brain of Zeus, and lik e the legend is a strangely false assertion.] Thus, into the trap Kant sets out to rescue Hume from, he himself falls, by asserting that: “it is only by means of the form of sensuous intuition that we can intuite things à priori , but in this way we intuite the objects only as they appear to our senses, not as they may be in themselves (p. 29). [Thus Kant himself proves the noumenon, the so le refuge from scepticism, itself to be sceptical.] Kant mu st have in some way felt the weakness of his argument, since in the following page, he, in true Berke leyan fashion, in order to upset the sceptic, argues in a circle; and to prove the possibility of à priori judgements, insists on the sceptic proving an à priori proposition. Having thoroughly entangled the sceptic , as he thinks, he launches out an “apodictic certainty,” very similar to Berkeley’s “God-idea,” and defines “Idealism” to “consist in the asser tion that there exist none but thinking entities.” [Crowley at once denies the “certa inty,” and demands an explanation of “thinking.”] Then work ing through the Berkeleyan arguments backwards, he arrives at defini ng. [Thing as a (unknowable) power to produce sense impressions, which is purely Berkeley or his antithesis according as the power is conceived as God or Matter.] He re we have struck again the fundamental chain A,B,A,B,A,B."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Having now settled with “Pure Mathema tics,” he turns to “Pure Natural Science,” again assuming at the outse t apodictic laws of nature, which Berkeley also assumed, and which Hu me proved to be sceptical; such as “substance continues permanent” – a th eory on the same footing as papal infallibility, and about a hundred years ol der – and that all that happens is “determined by a cause according to fixed laws” (p. 42). Concerning which Huxley states: “not one of these events is ‘more than probable’; though the probability may reach such a very hi gh degree that, in ordinary language, we are justified in saying that the opposite events are impossible.”* *Essay on Hume, p. 155. This is even going a step in advance of Hume, who stated: “a miracle is a violation of the laws of nature.”* As to the conservation of energy and matter, Crowley would say: [“they were arguments in a circle (A); for the use of scientific instruments by which they were discovere d, implies these laws.”] Kant would not say (A) but “ à priori truth”; and as to the laws of cause and effect, [if we accept causality , etc., then we mu st regard all as truly parts of one thing, perhaps even as aspects of one thing.] And Kant, after a series of analytical argumen ts, comes to the conclusion that the legitimacy of natural laws “rests on the necessary connection of phenomena in an experience, in other words, on the original laws of the understanding,” (p. 67). The understanding drawing its laws à priori not from nature, but prescribing them to it. [But thes e original laws of the (Kantian) understanding are themselves the result of the empirical laws of nature, and of an inherited wealth of experien ce; “Omnia exeunt in O.” And it is certainly not far from this to the Ego positing the non-Ego.] *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, p. 120. At length, thoroughly entrapped in hi s own metaphysics, caught by that very same net wherewithal he set out to drag the infinite depths of eternity; he defines the noumenon as the fi nal term of an infinite series, and asserts that the permanence of the soul can only be proved in the life of man, “the proof of which will not be required by us .” Then standing aghast as the phantasmagoria of his mind crowd past him; states in the plainest words, that the Reason itself is at fault, and casti ng it into the balance of Pyrrho, weighs it out in due terms of Crowleyanity."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The following are the four transcendent ideas, or four dialectical assertions of the pure Reason. To each accordingly is opposed a contradictory assumption (p. 87). Thesis Antithesis 1 The world has a beginning (boundary) in time and space.

There is no freedom, but all is Nature . 4 In the series of the world causes there exists a necessary being. There is nothing necessary but in this series all is contingent . “The above is the most remarkable phenomenon of the human Reason, of which no instance can be shown in any other sphere. If, as generally happens, we regard the phenomena of the world of sense as things in themselves; if we assume the principl es of their connection as universal of things in themselves, and not merely as principles valid of experience, as is usual and indeed unavoidable without our Critique; then an unexpected conflict arises, never to be quelled in the ordinary dogmatic way, because both theses and antitheses can be demons trated by equally evident, clear and irresistible proofs... and the Reason thus sees itself at issue with itself, a state over which the sceptic rejoices , but which must plunge the critical philosopher into reflection and disquiet .” [Thus another turning in the road of Crowleyanity has been passed, anot her milestone has been lost in the distance, a new vista is opening to us, and once again we gaze on the delusive mirage of the Reason, the me re Zill U’llah – The Shadow of God.] “...Seeing it is quite impossible to get free of this conflict of the Reason with itself, so long as the objects of the sense-world are taken for things in themselves, and not for what they ar e in reality, namely, mere phenomena, the reader is necessitated thereby ag ain to undertake the deduction of all our knowledge à priori “ (p. 96).

At length we have arrived at the end of our first series of arguments, which may be generalized as the infoldment of all rational philosophies into one uncertain philosophic problem. Berkel ey, as we have seen, opened the gateway of scepticism, and was the firs t to vanish in the Absolute ether of Pyrrhonism, which he outwardly symbolized under the form of a Bishop of the Church of England. Hume followi ng, clutched vaguely in the night of doubt at a “something” he could not grasp, and whose watery substance trickled through his clenched and search ing fingers. Kant similarly losing his way in the night of Hume’s ignorance, struck a spark on the tail of his shirt, proclaiming the day; but as the flam es rose and scorched his fundamental basis, he, also, leapt from his empiri c hose into the cool comfort of that watery ocean Hume had attempted to sh adow in the palm of his hand. Then behind these three gallant knights clattered along their no less gallant esquires: Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, a nd in the distance, lost in the dust of Reason, stand the present-day yokels of thought, thinking at appointed hours according to appointed books. FICHTE, SCHELLIN G, AND HEGEL Close on the heels of Kant came Fichte with his unknowable appulse as the only potency of the not-self, which assu aged the raging thirst of inquiry as would a bottle of wine long since dr y. Behind him Schelling, who leaping into the clouds, grasped at object and subject as existing actualities, calling the bastard children of his brain manife stations of the Absolute. Then Hegel who, instead of sitting out on the unive rsal stairs with Berkeley’s “Bishop,” waltzed wildly with some ethereal Absolute, which, whether object or subject, was in no case existence, me rely the skeleton of some phantom appearance, having no life in itself, but solely in the absolute mirror of its reflection. Each of these Titans, in his own manner, threw fresh fuel on to the Berkeleyan conflagration, so ho ping that, by piling up the blazing mass, they might illumine the entire universe. And how they failed the last five decades have only too directly shown, by their stagnation in the realms of a certain and unknowable Absolute; and in the parasitic growths of Scientific Agnosticism, Scientific Positivism, Scientific Monism , and the general"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"overwhelming materiali zation of present-day thought. Yet the self per se remains just as unknowable in a positive degree, as it would have, had all the ages forever held their peace. Neve rtheless the arguments which they set forth, ideal or material, have in their frantic efforts to support it, forced the whole gigantic structure to the gr ound. From these ruins of experience Crowley now rises up a fiery phoenix, di recting us to the only possible way which will lead us to our much-desired haven of rest. Motion must cease, irritation must be prevented, Time and Space annihilated, and the divine “I” set free from the sordid rags of the world, to be clothed in the brilliancy of God.* This added “impulse,” which in the homogeneous protoplasm causes fission, is as mystical to-day as that added “something” which will cause the mind of one man to admire a Wagnerian opera, and another a drawi ng by Beardsley. No sound is in the air, vibrations only pass. No sound is in the brain, molecular changes only result. Where then is sound? It is a creation in the mind by the divine “I”; that unextended absolute Passivity, whose dwelling is in that equilibrating activity which balances action and reaction. *It should never for a moment be forgo tten that any attempt to construct a positive philosophic system from these data woul d be strenuously repudi ated by Crowley. The danger constantly recurs, because in the nor mal (educated) man the reason is master. Like the hydra of Hercules, its heads grow agai n; they must be branded by the torch of illuminism, as well as smitten off by the sword of scepticism. Hegel (outside the realms of the di vine philosophers) was one of the very few who partially grasped the suprem e truth of Crowleyanity, when he postulated: “Being and Non-Being are the same.” He saw that pure being is, in its last analysis, beyond fertilizati on, development, or motion, and is practical nothingness. “The fertilization of Being, according to Hegel, arose by the passing over, as it were, of Being into its antitheses, othe rness, or complement – that is, into Non-Being. But this antithesis, otherne ss, complement, was in a real sense Being itself, for Being and Non-Being, be ing equally nothingness, are in the same category. Herein, however, were motion, interaction, stimulus, and no response to stimulus rendered, not onl y a possibility, but a reality; and Pure Being, thus enriched or fertilized by the double interaction, became manifested as existence – that is, conditioned Being. Pure Being, the Unconditioned, the Absolute of Potentiality rolled round into pure Non-"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Being, the Unconditioned; the Absolute of Impotentiality , emerged, energized, and conditioned, and became the Limited, the Relative. This is the groundwork of the Hegelian philosophy.”* *Absolute Relativism, p. 114. Yet once again that added impulse aris es in the passing over. What is it? Crowleyanity does not, in words, explai n; for being beyond reason, it is both inexplicable and undefinable in rational terms; yet it directs, and the weary traveller, searching for the stone of th e wise, has but to follow, guided by the sure and certain hope that if he so will, it will guide him to that great and glorious transfiguration he so ardently desires. TIME Kant, as we have seen, places both Time and Space in the realm of the à priori ; a realm utterly devastated by Crowley’s scepticism. Spencer in answering the questions, What is Space ? What is Time? replied, “Space is the abstract of all relations of co-exi stence. Time is the abstract of all relations of sequence.” These definiti ons have been found wanting, chiefly on account of the doubtful connotation of the word abstract, but with McTaggart’s emendation read: Space is the synthesis of all experiences of co-existence. Time is the synthesis of a ll experiences of sequence.* *Absolute Relativism, p. 14. So we find that taking the above as ge neral definitions, they may with equal accuracy be applied to either the Ego or the race; in the former case, Space and Time vanishing with the extinction of the individual; in the latter with that of the race. So also if space be defined as “the potentiality of all co- existences,” then in the destruction of all existences Spac e will also cease to be. But if Space be define d “as that eternal actuality wherein all other things or no things may co-exist, then, even on the destruction of all things, Space would still remain.”* Yet this definiti on is extremely faulty, as Time re- mains to be considered; whic h we shall now deal with. *Absolute Relativism, p. 15."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"In Crowley’s essay bearing the name of “Time” the matter is set forth in a dialogue between a British sceptic and an Indian mystic. In it, by a rather different route, he comes to a somewh at similar conclusion to that taught by Eckhart in Germany at the beginning of the fourteenth century. “That the creature apart from the Ab solute, that is, God, was nothing, that ‘Time, Space, and the plurality which depe nds on them,’ are also nothing in themselves, and that the duty of man as a moral being is to rise beyond this nothingness of the creature, and by di rect intuition to place himself in immediate union with the Absolute.”*1. The two disputants, Scepticus and Mysticus, set out by agreeing that the unknowable is unreal, and as the latter says with Berkeley, “a thing is only real to us so far as it is known by us.”*2. *1. The Real History of the Rosicrucians, A. E. Waite. *2. Time, vol. ii, p. 269. When Scepticus asks Mysticus, “H ow old are you?” and receives the answer, “I am but an ultimate trut h, six world-truths, fourteen grand generalizations, eighty generalizations , sixty-two dilemmas, and the usual odd million impressions,”*1. he is receiving a much more correct and scientific answer to his question th an if Mysticus, like Mahatma Agamya, answered, “sixty-two.” Mysticus then turning to Scepticus asks him the seemingly simple question, “What is a ‘year’?”*2. Scepticus answers something about the earth moving rou nd the sun, and is at once shown by Mysticus that a man stating a fact in reference to “Since the Derby was run,” would be more intelligible than he who would say, “Since May, such and such a day”; “...for his memory is of th e race, and not of a particular item in the ever changing space-relation of th e heavens, a relation which he can never know, and of which he can never perceive the significance; nay, which he can never recognize, even by land marks of catastrophic importance.”*3. Scepticus at once grasps the absurdity of such a situation by picturing the cross-examination of a farm-hand by a lawyer: *1. Time, vol. ii, p. 269. *2. Ibid . vol. ii, p. 270. *3. Ibid . vol. ii, p. 272. “Now, Mr. Noakes, I must warn you to be very careful.

Scepticus goes on to state that H. G. Wells has put his finger on th e very spot whence all research must begin: and that is, “the illusionary na ture of the time-idea.”*2. “You would say that of two men born on a day, dying on a day, one may be young, the other old... he lives the longest who remembers most .”*3. Mysticus considers the definition insuffici ent unless the “vividness of each impression” is added to the “number of impressions.” Scepticus then shows that it would be possible in thought to construct a scale of vividness from a to n , by which we could erect a formula to express all that a man is. “For example, he might be: 10 a +33125 b +890 c +800112 658 e +992 f +...+...+... n , and, if we can find the ratio of a : b : c : d : e : f ...: n , we can resolve the equation into a single term , and compare man and man.”*4. *1.

It therefore follows that “all states of consciousness are single units, or time marks, by which we measure intervals.” So that Time is wholly and solely founded on experience, or response to stimulus; and in no way on any à priori judgement as postulated by Kant. Berkeley has shown us that it is impossible to form an abstract idea of motion distinct from the body moving,*1. also that “motion being only an idea, it follows that if it be not percei ved it exists not;”*2. and in the “Three Dialogues” he again maintains this indisputable fact: *1.

THE QABALAH Before entering upon Aleister Crowley’ s ontological essay on Space, it will be as well first to run through, briefly though it may be, some of the more important eclaircissements of the Qabalah, and th e influence this divine theurgy has alike borne on his poetry and philosophy; for his analysis of space is based on the ontological asse rtion of the absoluteness of the Qabalistic Zero. Worshippers of a personal God are by na ture ultra-materialistic. Their God is but a friend, a mighty man who w ill eventually pull them out of the present bog of existence; being too lazy to do so themselves, they invest him with special powers; once fashioned, th e next step was to endow him with an immortalizing energy, and then, curious to say, they disc overed he had given them, as a slight reward, an immortal soul for all the trouble they had taken in turning him out a really nice, am iable, and respectable Deity.

These two powers, the Pantheonic materialism and the Gnostic spiritualism, bore the hybrid – Christianity. As all religions have fina lly become subservient to an interested priesthood, so have all religions (however spiritu al they may have been in their youth) been materialized and sacrif iced on the altar of gain. To this rule Christianity forms no exception; once crudely and sincerely spiritual, it has become deceitfully materialistic. God, who was formerly an Almighty Pl eroma, is now but the moke which carries the priest’s eggs to market; and Christ, the Saviour and Redeemer, the stick with which the wretched old jennet is beaten along. Christianity is no longer what its name implies, the system of doctrines as taught by Christ, but diametrically the reverse, the syst em of desires as wrought by Man.

Th e great thoughts of old prostituted to the gains and stupidity of modernity, a great libel foisted on the past to satisfy the credulity of th e present; a systematized thieving from the statue of Isis to adorn the idol of Mammon, god of bankers, brigands, and beggars. Astrology gave us astronomy, and Al chemy gave us chemistry, both were antagonistic to the ideas of their da y; let us hope that Psychical Research will give us a purer metaphysics. Now the question before us here, is: how does all this de caying and growing of ideals affect the poetic philosophy of Aleister Crowley? And the answer is as follows: To the writer of this essay it seems on reading Aleister Crowley’s poems that the revolt against existing ideals a nd morals is more the outcome of spontaneous intuition than of medita tive scepticism: and so strong is the current, and so diverse and intricate are its eddies, that for one who is not an adept, it seems almost a forlorn hope to plunge into the boiling cataract of his ontologic philos ophy, with any expectation of reaching the further bank in safety. It would perhap s seem safer to forego such an attempt altogether, but so alloyed have these mystical id eas become with the general structure of his philosophy, that such a course is rendered impossible, so that the failure of safety would be only more i gnominious than the failure of attempt. Aleister Crowley as we have seen is no Christian, neither is he a gullible spiritualist, nor a gross materialist. Seek ing an answer to th e mystery, he first finds it in the ontology of the Qabalah, and then finally through Mysticism and Agnosticism, to their reconcilia tion in a neo-Hermeticism, a neo- Rosicrucianism – which we have already called Crowleyanity.*"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"*Not only has Crowley succeeded in finding all the scattered pieces of Osiris which Isis discovered, but also his phallus which she could not find. Yet though he does not end at that barrier beyond which the Rationalist cannot proceed, he by no means reject s common sense and understanding as his Epode on Nature clearly shows. Nature my name is called. O fruitless veil Of the strange self of its own self begotten! O vision laughterless! O shadowy tale! . . . . . . . . . . . . . I am Nature and God: I reign, I am, alone. None other may abide apart: they perish, Drawn into me, into my being grown.

I am: the greatest and the least: the sole And separate life of things. The mighty stresses Of worlds are my nerves twitching.

Rivers roll To make one tear in my superb caresses, When on myself myself begets a child, A system of a thousand planets piled! . . . . . . . . . . . . . ...I wheel in wingless flight Through lampless space, the starless wildernesses! Beyond the universal bounds that roll, There is the shrine and image of my soul.* *Orpheus, vol. iii, pp. 156, 157. Many of the believers in the Qabalah, as those in the Vedas, will give an almost endless antiquity to the ideas contained in their books. In one degree"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"at least they are right, for the mystic ism as contained in these systems of thought is as old as thought itself. The great system of the Qabalah is one of emanation – a type of spiritual monism, an attempted explanation of the nature of the Deity, within the limitations of mind. Its correspondence with the Talmud is more of method than material. That it was of slow gr owth is very certain, that it is a conglomerated mass of a multitude of effo rts is also most sure. The Zohar is its corner-stone, and the date of its construction extends probably from the second to the seventh century of th e present era. Much of its logic, psychology, metaphysics, ph ilosophy, and theology, is drawn directly from the Midrash. To make it superior to profane literature its simplicity has at various times been cloaked in a trucul ent obscurantism, many of its students delighting in paraphrases and hermeneu tical constructions. Because of their unintelligibility words were transpos ed, numericalisms added, till at last much if not all its sense was lost in a maze of mental legerdemain, and in such exegetical methods as Gematria , Temurah, and Notariqon, which on the very face of the argument seem to condemn a system which aimed at supplying mankind with a great and beautiful truth. We should not like to say that Aleister Crowley’s poems are entirely guiltless of the accusation of obscurity ; but to the uninitiated more lies below the surface than is ever dreamt of; and we do not consider that the use which he frequently makes of words, or rather names of an inward grace, should be considered as obscure. It is not difficult for the most uninstructed in the Qabalah to discover that Bina h is equivalent to inspiration or understanding, that Chokmah means wis dom or revelation, or in fact to grasp the simpler ideas contained in the Sephirotic Scheme. Without such knowledge, in fact, half the pleasure is lost in not understanding these poems, and a false idea of an attempt to “flummox” the reader’s mind arises. A mystery is simply an unanswered riddle. If to a person who knows not a single word of Urdu, I use such expre ssions as “suar,” “sala,” “bahinchut,” they to his mind will be entirely sterile of meaning; but not so, however, to the initiated, who would highly appreciat e them (unless applied to himself). Such use of words appears only absurd to these who fail to understand their meaning. A word may be charged with meaning just as a battery may be charged with electricity. Unconditiona lly there is little difference, beyond the literation, between “Hocus-pocus” and “Gee-up.” If I say the latter to my towel-horse, I do not expect it to break into a canter; if, however, I say it to my pony, and it holds the key of this myst ery, I do; so with any other word. I"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"say “hocus-pocus,” and the gullible are wrapped in mystery; or better I say “Hoc Est Corpus” over some bread and wine, and the devout suppliant becomes filled with religious fervour. As in physics there is a kinetic force, so in metaphysics there is a kinetic id eation. To the Qabalist, the Qabalah unlocks as a key the corridor of the so ul, and the pent-up sense rushes forth as some prisoner released from his dungeon, a mingled mass of emotion and reality. To the sceptic no change take s place, far his mind is sterile and unable to conceive, but his ignorance in no way proves that the Qabalah is mere Buncombe. Because a weak man cannot lift a certa in weight, that is no criterion that a strong man cannot. There is truth in everything, and truth lies beyond mere utility. If we ca nnot understand, it is sheer falsehood to say Yes or No, the agnostic mode being the onl y right course open to us; yet if it were put to us to answer such a question as “Is the reverse of the moon studded with tintacks?” “No!” would na turally be the correct answer, and not, “I cannot tell you”; for as long as the bastion of our doubt is stronger than the cannon of our enemies’ asser tion, we then, tem porarily at least, have every right to answer in the negative. To be a student of the mysterious is a very different thing from being a mystic. That the author wa s the latter must surely be disproved on reading “Ascension Day” and “Pentecost,” that he belongs to the neo-mystics or theosophists is openly denied in a note to the former poem, and in the preliminary invocation to “Jephthah. ” In which latter poem the following may be aptly quoted as showing how that, when reason lies fallow, modern spiritism is steadily supplanting Christianity: Master, the night is falling yet again. I hear dim tramplings of unholy forces: I see the assembly of the foully slain: The scent of murder steams: riderless horses Gallop across the earth, and seek the inane: The sun and moon are shaken in their courses: The kings are gathered, and the vultures fall Screaming, to hold their ghastly festival.* *Jephthah, vol. i, p. 66.

In “The Alchemist,” or in that beau tiful poem “The Fare well of Paracelsus to Aprile.” “Struggling in vain to wh at one hopes the best.”* We find this larger hope is here the keynote, as it is in so many of Crowley’s poems; to mention perhaps the most noted, we fi nd this sacred flame flashing forth in “Aceldama,” “Paracelsus,” “The Ultima te Voyage,” “The Nameless Quest,” “The Neophyte,” and in “Ta nnhäuser.” Many of the poems in “Songs of the Spirit” and “The Holy of Holies,” hold fa st to this idea; and it is this ideal, the progression from the Kingdom to th e Crown, from Malkuth to Kether, which constitutes one of the most b eautiful doctrines of the older and simpler Qabalah. *Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 40. The Qabalah guides us to a divine th eurgy. According to the Zohar it is impossible to know God, herein the Qabalah is Agnostic, it forbids the representation of God, herein it is Rational. The Ain Soph is the “All- pervading,” the “Non Ens” dwelling in the “Non Est,” it is inscrutable to man’s mind; this vast Pleroma, Corona Summa, The All, is formless, and is symbolized by a circle, it is Nothing. As the Ain Soph is the closed eye of"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"the Unknown Darkness, so is Macropr osopus, who resides in the crown Kether, the open eye of the Vast Countenance. And from Macroprosopus through Wisdom (Chokmah, mascu line) and Understanding (Binah, feminine) there is emanated the Le sser Countenance – Microprosopus. The relation between these two is idealistic, being the relation of the Absolute as it really is, to the Absolu te as it is conceived by man. And it is the search after this relationship – God – that Crowley so frequently and ardently depicts. Awful and terrible is its path ; the very blood of the heart hisses, as water on hot iron, as it rushes throu gh its fiery veins fanned by a flaming soul: By the sun’s heat, that brooks not his eclipse And dissipates the welcome clouds of rain.

In many other of these poems do we find depicted other phases of the philosophy of the Qabalah; one, the He rmetic maxim, “T hat which is above is as that which is below,” we find stated in “The Philosopher’s Progress”: That which is highest as the deep Is fixed, the depth as that above: Death’s face is as the face of Sleep; And Lust is likest Love.* *Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 34. In “The Quest” and in several parts of “Tannhäuser,” we are conveyed into the maze of mystic numbers, which we do not intend to enter here. “My womb is pregnant with mad moons and suns,”* and yet we ultimately feel, on reading deep into these mystical poems, “Too wise to grieve, too happy to rejoice.” *The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i. p. 166."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"With one number, however, or rather w ith the primal symbol of all numbers – 0 (zero), we shall deal. In a slende r pamphlet entitled “Berashith,” Aleister Crowley ontologically asserts the Absoluteness of the Qabalstic Zero .* Let us as shortly as possible now see how he arrives at this ultimate genesis. *Berashith, vol. ii, p. 236. The ancient Hebrew Qabalah was as cl osely connected with Assyriology, as it was with Babylonian and Egyptia n thought, Hindu mythology, and the philosophy of the Vedas a nd Upanishads; its conception of the supreme God was ineffable, for He bore neither name nor attribute, being beyond the power of human conception. Over th e face of the whole world we find earnest thought arriving at or towards such a conclusion. In ancient China we hear Lao-Tze declaring: “What is there superior in Heaven and Earth, and from which Heaven and Earth sprung ? Nay, what is there superior to Space and which moves in Space? The great Tao is the parent of Space, and Space is the parent of Heaven and Earth, and Heaven and Earth produced men and things...” A similar concepti on of the Wisdom is held in the Chaldaic, Memrah ; in the Vach , or word, of the Rig Veda; in the Honover or word, of the Zend Avesta; in the Avalôkitêsvara , or Kwan-Yin , the Sakti of Amitâbha , the boundless light of the late r Mahayana Buddhists. Again we find it in the conception of Prana or life spirit of ancient India; the Atharva- veda says: “Reverence to Prana, to whom the universe is subject, who has been lord of all, on whom all is s upported.” Prana is the Purusha or AUM, the totality of Brahman, Vishnu, and Si va, of Past, Present, and Future. The Wisdom of the Book of Proverbs, and the later Book of Wisdom; it is also the same power as the Eden illa-ah of the Zohar, the Be’ Raisheeth of many Qabalists and Talmudists, the Logos of Philo and St. John, and the Sophia of Plato. All the above are Absolute ideals, and so can bear only a relationship and no proportionate value whatever to our finite understanding, they can only be watched, and have never been realized; and for this reason is it that they have never been appreciated by the mass of their so-called believers: I will not look at her; I dare not stay.

In the Qabalistic Dogmas of Pistor ius we read even as regards Kether, the Crown, “There is no name among Qabalists by which the supreme King is designated; they speak of the cr own only, which proves the existence of the King, and they say that this cr own is Heaven.” If so of Kether, how much more so of the Ain Soph! Above the Crown Kether, the first Sephirah, is the ( }ya ), i.e. , Ain , the No- Thing. “It is so named because we do not know, that which there is in this Principle, because it never descends as far as our ignorance, and because it is above Wisdom itself.”* *Zohar, iii, fol. 2886 (Meyer)."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"“Not only does the Qabbalah repudiate the adage ex nihilo nihil fit, i.e. , ‘From nothing, nothing is made,’ that is, nothing can come from nothing, but it does not believe in the absolute a nnihilation of anything which has ever existed. ‘There is not anything new unde r the sun.’*1. ‘Not any Thing,’ says the Zohar, ‘is lost in the universe, not even the vapour which goes out of our mouths, as all things, it has its place and destination, and the Holy One, blessed be It! makes it conc ur to Its works; not anything falls into the void, not even the words and the voice of man, but all has its place and its destination.”*2. *1.

The Qabalist Abram ben Dior, says: “Whe n they (the Qabalists) affirm, that All Things have been drawn from No-T hing, they do not wish to speak of nothing properly to say, for never can being come from Non-being, but they understand by Non-being, that, which one can conceive of, neither by its cause nor by its essence; it (the No Thi ng) is in a word, the Cause of Causes; it is It whom we all call the Primordial Non-being, because It is anterior to the entire universe...” No clear formulated reply can naturally be given to the Formless, all we can know concerning it is: that Something emanates from No-thing; that out of the Formless emerges the Formed, how and why remains unanswered: this alone is the only meaning we can give to creation ex nihilo . Crowley explains the Qabalist’s positio n thus: “The Qabalists explain the ‘First Cause,’ by the phrase: ‘From 0 to 1, as the circle opening out into the line’ ...I am bound to express my view that when the Qabalists said Not, they meant Not, and nothing else. In fa ct, I really claim to have rediscovered the long-lost and central Arcanum of those divine philosophers.”* *Berashith, vol. ii, p. 236."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"“I ASSERT THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THE QABALISTIC ZERO.” “When we say that the Cosmos sprang from 0, what kind of 0 do we mean? By 0 in the ordinary sense of the term we mean ‘absence of extension in any of the categories.’ “When I say ‘No cat has two tails,’ I do not mean, as the old fallacy runs, that ‘Absence of cat possesses two tails ,’ but that ‘In the category of two- tailed things, there is no extension of cat!’ “Nothingness is that about which no pos itive proposition is valid. We cannot truly affirm: ‘Nothingness is green, or heavy, or sweet.’ “Let us call time, space, being, heav iness, hunger, the ca tegories. If a man be heavy and hungry, he is extended in a ll these, besides, of course, many more. But let us suppose, that these five are all. Call the man X; his formula is then X t+s+b+h+ h . If he now eat, he will cease to be extended in hunger; if he be cut off from time and gravitation as well, he will now be represented by the formula X s+b . Should he cease to occupy sp ace and to exist, his formula would then be X 0 . This expression is equal to 1; whatever X may represent, if it be raised to the power of 0 (this meaning mathematically, ‘if it be extended in no dimension or category ’), the result is Unity, and the unknown factor X is eliminated. “This is the Advaitist idea of the future of man; his personality, bereft of all its qualities, disappears and is lost, while in its place arises the impersonal Unity, The Pleroma, Parabrahma, or the Allah of the Unity-adoring followers of Mohammed.

Thus from the Hegelian abstraction of the non ens we have at last touched bottom, and have come down to the fact s of real life. Empty space is the postulate of all metaphys ics, but all absolute quantities finally must be beyond the finitely reasoning mind.

When the scientist eternalizes matter and motion by asserting their abso lute indestructibility, he is merely asserting an absolute unity, which in reality is a synonym of absolute nullity – 0=1, but he at once, to propitiate his Reason, forsakes his God – (Ain"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Soph) – and sacrifices his only bego tten son (Unity) on the blood-stained altar of Evolution, by ascribing to it a tendency to dividuality, thus barbarously immolating his sacred child by rendering him one with the divine fiat of Genesis.* *“Heaven and earth and the ten thousand thin gs come from existence, but existence comes from non-existence.” “The T A O begets unity, unity begets duality; duality begets trinity; and trinity begets the ten thousand things.” — Lao-Tze . Berkeley, nearly two hundred years ago now, answered the scientists apparently for all time, by stating: “...it seems no less absurd to suppose a substance without accidents, than it is to suppose accidents without a substance.” And that, “though we should grant the unknown substance may possibly exist, yet where can it be suppos ed to be? That it exists not in the mind is agreed; and that it exists not in place is no less certain – since all place or extension exists only in the mi nd, as hath been already proved. It remains, therefore, that it exists nowhere at all”*1. i.e. , in the Absolute Zero. And again he asserts, this time by the word of Ph ilonous: “Consequently every corporal substance being the substratum of extension must have in itself another extension, by wh ich it is qualified to be a substratum : and so on to infinity? And I ask whether this be not absurd in itself, and repugnant to what you granted just now, to wit, that the substratum was something distinct from and exclusive of extensi on?”*2. And what is pure extension? – Absolute Zero. *1. The Principles of Human Knowledge, p. 69. *2. The Three Dialogues, p. 45. Thus the whole cosmic process reso lves itself under the one great law of Inertia; so that the entire Un iverse lies before us, as Luther said of God, “A blank sheet on which nothing is found, but what we ourselves have written.” Or again, in the words of the divine Spinoza: “final or first causes are only figments of the human mind,” bubbles wh ich must burst before the finite can once again dissolve into the infinite at mosphere of eternity. This seeming duality is that which Crowley infers when he states: “In any category, infinity excludes finity, unless that fi nity be an identical part of that infinity.”* *Berashith, vol. ii, p. 234.

This is the meaning of “Time is the fourth Dimension.” So the hard thinking of Crowley arrives even tually at the transcendental idea of considering Space as a plan e, and nearness as Time. “Can Space be identified with Matter (Akasa, me ans both), and Time with Motion?” Crowley answers, “Yes.” [F or in extension Space is the single immovable consciousness; Time the exte nsion in number, the motion of the immobiles.

In the Is’a Upanishad we read: Into dense darkness he enters Who has conceived becoming to be naught, Into yet denser he Who has conceived becoming to be aught. In the second discourse of the Bhagavad-G ī t ā we also read: Uncleavable He, incombustible He, and indeed neither to be wetted nor dried away; perpetual, all-pervasive, stable, immovable, ancient, unmanifest, unthinkable, immutable He is called. This is very much like the Athanasi an Creed, after ha ving defined God in every possible way, to end up by descri bing him as “incomprehensible.” Not so the Buddhist who went back to the older vedic conception: In the beginning there is existence blind and without knowledge; and in this sea of ignorance there are appetences formative and organizing. — The Questions of King Milinda . We must, however, pass by the questi on of beginning, and see how the Buddhistic ideals have affected th e poetry and philosophy of Aleister Crowley. According to Buddhism, existence is sorrow, the cause of sorrow is desire, the cessation of sorrow is the cessation of desire, which can only be realized by following the Noble Eightfold path . This intimate connection between sorrow and desire, as we have seen, is vividly described by Crowley in many of his poems.

Buddhism may be called the religion of Science, notwithstanding the fact that it arose in the East hundreds of years before what we call modern science was born. The youth of systems, as of individuals, is lost in the mist of the past, unknown to themselves, diml y apparent to others, they proceed through wondering childh ood, ambitious youth, maturity, and decay. The crucibles and retorts of the alchym ists are but the toys of youthful Chemistry, its dolls and tin soldiers: God and devil, angel and goblin, are but the fairies of Grimm or Andersen, or the gnomes who spring through the flooring of Drury Lane to the amazeme nt of little children. The human first adores images, then imaginations; the little girl who loves her doll will neglect it to tend her youngest little brother or sister, whom she will kiss and pinch in the true fashion of the human ; and when scarcely in her teens will commence those necessary and attractiv e adornments to enable her shortly to have a real little doll of her own. The little boy will forsake his brave little man in tin, in order to watch the soldiers in the park, or turn the coal cellar into a robber’s den, or the garden seat into a pirate’s bark, poetically he is realizing the grim struggle which lies before him; both doubt their toys, and eagerly peer into the dark corridor of Li fe, which, alas, is so often but a Blue Beard’s chamber of despair. So with religions and philosophies, in doubt they arise, with doubt they thrive, a nd by doubt they are urged on; Hope, like a will-o’-the-wisp, dances before them, leading them through marsh and mire, down dale and o’er hill, deep through the frozen forest, and the broad sun-scorched plain, over seas and oc eans, over continents, and worlds, far, far through universes and systems, past stars, past comets and suns, deep into the depths of unutterable mystery; and there through the æons midst, the birth of worlds, in the very womb of Time sunk on some fleeting asteroid, is the aspirant, “O Hope! O Hope!

Between the theist and the atheist stands the agnostic, and as the most vital point of attack is that which lies neares t to the object to be attacked, the great danger to theistic churches was threat ened not from the atheistical extremity, but from the Agnostic frontier. The Agnostic said, “I do not know,” the theist said, “I do,” hence the uninterr upted warfare of 3,000 years or more, in which the priest has ever been ready to lie for the greater glory of his God, as S’afi well said: Then speak the truth, if so a priest May tune his tongue to anything but lies.* *The Fatal Force, vol. i, p. 142.

This, the mob of mankind are very lo ath to do, for instead of honestly expressing nine-tenths of their knowle dge in terms of doubt, they cast the whole onus of Absolute or Noumenal knowledge on to the back of some aching and asinine deity. By postulating Unknowability, which if treat ed as an absolute term is also a positive one (God), Spencer the Transf igured Realist was hoisted by that very same petard he had himself inte nded to tie to the wagging tail of the Christian Deity. Thus by rendering all knowledge automorphological, in order to annihilate the unity of thirty -nine articles without parts or passions, rearing himself up, he plunged down, crea ting in his fall, “a footless stocking without a leg“ – Unknowability. In “Eleusis” Crowley illustrates this, and says: “Evolution is no better than creation to explain things, as Spencer showed.”* *Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 228. Huxley the sublime philosopher, the tr ue agnostic, the periphery of whose knowledge extended far into those mi rrored realms wherein Spencer only saw his own distorted countenance, seeing well that Hylo-Idealistic- Solipsism led the whole sentient crea tion from sub-rational matter to rational man, was sufficiently a true agnostic not to deny the possibility of a divine Solipsism, leading rational man to a super-rational God, but yet not sufficiently illuminated to transmut e ”I doubt” into ”I know.” However, Huxley grasped the great and grand tr uth that the natural philosopher who examines worlds, suns, and stars, is in reality only experimenting on his own “inner consciousness,” beyond which to him there is Nothing. These stars thou seest Are but the figuring of thy brain.*"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 89. This Nothing, this absolute nihility, is again the Qabalistic Zero. Huxley did not belong to that now rapidly growing school ( sic ) of crapulous scientists who inflate themselves, like the frog in the fable, with the gases produced from an eightpenny box of chemicals w ith which they intend to solve in some dingy attic the flashing my steries of the spheres. The Caput Mortuum was his playground, but the Anima Vitae eluded his eager grasp; yet this greatest of modern philosophers, curious to say, stood almost alone, on one side growling science asserting, “T here is no Archaeus,” on the other religion howling ”There is! There is !” Yet as a positive and a negative formulate Zero, so these twain were as one yelping pack of jackals, who prowl by night fearing the brightness of the day. Huxley aptly sums up the standpoint an Agnostic should take in the following: If a piece of lead were to remain suspended of itself in the air, the occurrence would be a “miracl e” in the sense of a wonderful event, indeed; but no one trained in the methods of science would imagine that any law of nature was really violated thereby. He would simply set to work to investigat e the conditions under which so highly unexpected an occurrence took pl ace, and thereby enlarge his experience, and modify his hitherto unduly narrow conceptions of the laws of nature.* *Huxley’s Hume, p. 155. “It will be said that these are miracles, but we reply that miracles, when they are genuine, are simply facts for science.” “A philosopher has declared that he w ould discredit universal testimony rather than believe in the resurrecti on of a dead person, but his speech was rash, for it is on the faith of universal testimony that he believ ed in the impossibility of the resurrection. Supposing such an occurrence were proved, wh at would follow? Must we deny evidence, or renounce reason? It would be absurd to say so.

Huxley continues: “The day-fl y has better grounds for calling a thunderstorm supernatural than ha s man, with his experience of an infinitesimal fraction of duration, to sa y that the most astonishing event that can be imagined is beyond the scope of natural causes.”* And that there is no such thing as the violation of the la ws of nature, but merely a violation of that understanding which falsely inte rprets a “something” which reason alone cannot grasp. *Huxley’s Hume, p. 156. How different is this agnosticism fro m the agnosticism of Spencer; which postulates as its first great principl e, the unknowability of the Absolute, of whom we can conceive no proportion whatsoever, but whose relationship to us becomes closer and closer as we proceed along the way of the knowable – and perhaps actually becomes know n when we ourselves become unknowable, i.e. , pure adepts. The second great principle is the Conservation of Matter and Energy, or in other word s the law of Cause and Effect. A law we have gone to some length in demons trating to be apodictically untenable, though highly probably à posteriori . Crowley, like Hume and Huxley, solely identifies it as a law based upon inference. This sequence of events is vividly demonstrated in “The Mother’s Tr agedy.” Cora thinks, “God hath made smooth the road beneath the hearse of my forgetful age.” Not so however: They know not, learn not, cannot calculate How subtly Fate Weaves its fine mesh, perceiving how to wait; Or how accumulate The trifles that shall make it master yet Of the strong soul that bade itself forget.* *The Mother’s Tragedy, vol. i, pp. 156-7.

This law of Cause and Effect logically leads us to the third great principle of both Buddhism and Spencerian Agnostic ism – ”The absence of an Ego.” In support of this assertion, Crow ley quotes from Huxley’s ”Evolution and Ethics,” and considers it to be an admirable summary of the Buddhist doctrine.* *The Sword of Song, Science and Buddhism, vol. ii, p. 246. The Ego does not exist. It is morning; I walk down the hill to catch a train; as I walk I literally leave shreds of myself behind me. I am no longer the “I“ of five minutes ago, fleeting I pa ss along life’s way. A minute gone by my footstep crushed a daisy, there is wo e in the land of flowers; yet a few seconds past and I slew a fly, there is weeping in the land of insects. I speed to catch the train, I slip, and in a dazzling flash am converted into a glutinous mass of jelly and crushed bones. Crumpl ed as some much-written palimpsest I am thrown to the basket of the d ead, a useless manuscript. When was I, “I”; in the morning when I crushed the da isy, when I slew the fly, or when I was converted into pulp? Which? Th e Buddhist answers, “you were never ‘I,’” the Agnostic answers, “You were never ‘I,’” both merely state – see that on the papyrus of thy life thou inscri best what is good, what is beautiful, for others must read it, it is thy soul. Change, change, no stability. The “is“ is not as the ”was,” and the “was” is not as the “will be”; every cause has its effect: “Freewill” is the postulate of Morality, “Determination” of Science. Thus in Buddhism we find Anikka, Dukkha, and Anatta, and in Agnostic ism Change, Sorrow, and Absence of an Ego; and in both: That to deny all religions is a sublime act of faith.

Thus all changeability is uncertainty, from the Gods and the Suns which we worship, to the kisses we shower on our loved ones’ lips; as Crowley sings: Why must despair to madness drive The myriad fools th at fear to die?

Thus Reason ends by whispering: “I am agnostic; I cannot answer yea or nay.” This is the crowning triumph of the nineteenth century! Kant has proved beyond all doubt, that by empi rical means we can never hope to penetrate beyond the tremendous nigh t of Reason; then came Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, they, peering into the depths of the Darkness, here and there saw some fleeting asteroid; af ter them came Huxley, who glooming into the depths, far in the distance, saw the whirling cloud of stars, still beyond him must we go, beyond that tr embling cloud which hovers as some tired dove on the horizon of our minds, past nebulæ of stars and molten suns singing midst new-born spheres and hoary -headed worlds, “I would that I were the sky that I might be all ey es to behold thee,” till the stars circle about us, and the wild comets speed by, and suns embrace suns, and the moons melt shrieking through the firm ament. Then all powers will dissolve, and the great golden dawn effulgent w ill flash through the portals of night, standing before us bride of our desire, robed in a minion suns, the stars flaming in her hair, incarnate symbol of perpetual youth.

Surrounded by fools on every side, we are apt as Agnostics to consider ourselves the only torch-bearers of tr uth; and through ig norance, joining ourselves to a particular body, hoist on high our spluttering brand of mundane tar, declaring we have discovered that light which moved on the face of the waters, before sun or m oon or stars were created.

Mansel saw it and counsels us to try Faith, as if it was not the very fact that Faith was futile that bade us appeal to reason. Huxley saw it, and, no remedy presenting itself but a vague faith in the possib ilities of human evolution, called himself an agnostic: Kant saw it for a moment, but it soon hid itself behind his terminology; Spencer saw it, and tried to gloss it over by smooth talk, and to bury it beneath the ponderous tomes of his unwieldy erudition.* *Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 228. This may be further amplified by the following quotation from Eckartshausen: In time and space knowledge is but relative. Is it not true that all which we call reality is but relative, for absolute truth is not to be found in the phenomenal world. Thus your natural reason does not possess its true essence, but only th e appearance of truth and light: and the more the essence of light inwardly fades, and the man confuses himself with this appear ance, and gropes vainly after the dazzling phantasmal images he conjures.* *The Cloud upon the Sanctuary, p. 3.

Ignorance or Knowledge have nothing to do with illumination any more than pig has to do with Chicago pork; yet as there are standards of knowledge, so ar e there degrees of illumination; for there is not the slightest doubt that Booth and Robert Evans stand on a much lower footing than a St. Augustine or a Paracelsus; yet nevertheless, Boehme, who was only a shoemaker, ra nks with them.*2. “It is no doubt more difficult,” writes Crowley, “to le arn ‘Paradise Lost’ by heart than ‘We are seven,’ but when you have done it, you are no better at figure skating.”*3. So a Boehme may rank with an Augustin e, whilst an Evans may not. *1. Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 220. *2. Whittling shoe soles seems at one time to have been a special calling for mystics, besides Jacob Boehme, there was George F ox, and John Bunyan; also Eliphas Lévi was the son of a shoemaker.

Af ter the colossal fable of Œdipus we find the gracious poem of Psyche, which was certainly not invent ed by Apuleius. The great magical arcanum reappears here under the figure of a myster ious union between a god and a weak mortal abandoned alone and naked on a ro ck. Psyche must remain in ignorance of the secret of her ideal royalty, and if she behold he r husband she must lose him. —E. Lévi, The Doctrine of Transcendent Magic , p. 16. Inspiration does not enter into the unde rstanding, it illuminates a deeper part of the Ego, and under its influence th e imagination is diverted from the speculative understanding to more active powers which release the imprisoned “I.” When once these power s are released from the earthy grasp of the understanding, and the Ego sl oughs its outward empirical skin, we then become mystics; nevertheless, “ If any man say, I l ove God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brot her whom he seeth,"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"how can he love God whom he seeth not .” So the mystic’s work lies here in life, and the greatest and most divi ne mystics have probably been those whose naïveté of soul was such, that they knew not that they were mystics; and whose illumination has become so brilliant, that they cannot even find expression in the most divine of sym bols. Such adepts who arrive at so exalted a plane, keep silence, as Crowle y says: “the first and last ordeals and rewards of the Adept are comprise d in the maxim ‘Keep Silence’!”* *Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 221. “TO KNOW, TO DA RE, TO WILL, TO K EEP SILENT, are the four words of the magus, inscribed upon th e four symbolic forms of the Sphinx. “To command the elements, we must have overcome their hurricanes, their lightnings, their abysses, their tempests. “In order to DARE we must KNOW; in order to WILL we must DARE; we must WILL to possess empire, and to rei gn we must BE SILENT.” —E.

In his essay ”Eleusis,” Crowley s uggests that the world’s history may roughly be divided into a continuous succession of periods, each embracing three distinct cycles – of Renaissance, Decadence, and Slime. In the first the Adepts rise as artists, philosophers, and men of science, who are sooner or later recognized as great men; in the second the adepts as adepts appear, but seem as fools and knaves; a nd in the third, that of Slime, vanish altogether, and are invisible.* Then the chain starts again. Thus Crowley writes: *Dionysius thus describes the mystical adept: “Then is he delivered from all seeing and being seen, and passes into the truly mystic al darkness of ignorance, where he excludes all intellectual apprehensions, and abides in the utterly impalpable and invisible; being wholly His who is above all, with no other dependence, either on himself or any other; and is made one, as to his nobler part, w ith the Utterly Unknown, by the cessation of all knowing; and at the same time, in that very knowing nothing, he knows what transcends the mind of man.” — De Mysticâ Theologiâ , cap. i, p. 710. Decadence marks the period when the adepts, nearing their earthly perfection, become true ad epts, not mere men of genius. They disappear, harvested by heaven: and perfect darkness (apparent death) ensues until the youthful forerunners of the next crop begin to shoot in the form of artists.*"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"*Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 222. During this period of darkness come s the swarm of materializing and secularizing worshippers, who perceive only the gross symbols and not the truth that lies behind them: “The Church which begins to exteriorise,” says Crowley, “is already lost .”* And he continues furt her on in the same essay: *Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 221. Now when Paganism became popular, organised, state- regulated, it ceased to be individual: th at is to say, it ceased to exist as a religion, and became a social institution little better than the Church which has replaced it. But initiate s – men who had themselves seen God face to face, and lived – preser ved the vital essence. They chose men, they tested them; they instru cted them in methods of invoking the Visible Image of the Invisibl e. Thus by a living chain religion lived in the Mysteries of Eleusis.* *Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 225. Thus true religion consists in a spontaneous outburst of passionless illuminism, and not in the regular ra nting of the boundless buncombe of a bawdy book.

The yogi proposes to himself no less a task than to master the entire universe, and finding that the mind ha s the reflexive power of looking back into its own depths, does his utmost to develop this power by turning the mind, as it were, by artificial means, inside on itself, concentrating all its powers on itself, and stopping it at ev ery turn from wandering outside of itself.

Sober reason a nd solid judgement offer no prize more desirable than death after a number of years, less or greater, while ecstasy can, if the facts stat ed in the Dialogue are accepted, give the joys of all thes e years in a moment.

It differs from dreaming, because the subject is awake. It differs from hallucination, because there is no organic disturbance: it is, or claims to be, a temporary enhancement, not a partial disi ntegration, of the mental faculties.

MYSTICISM* This is “the peace which passeth a ll understanding,” a conscious communion with the Absolute by paths which lie beyond the dialectical; when the consciousness is full of God and is carried outside itself by a sublime alienation which cannot be ma de intelligible in words; and even if we could do so, we should assimilate to our minds the very qualities which constitute our minds, concerning which it is equa lly a lie to exclaim. Yea or Nay! There is no equivalence of moti on in Samâdhi, Samâdhi being beyond motion, a perfect equilibrium. Yea and Nay are extensions in maya, and can give no true perception of Samâdhi to the inquirer, beyond a nebulous symbolization, in which Samâdhi can alone be ill clad, and which word-rags are by the ignorant so often mistaken for the perfect conception itself. *The word Mystery comes from the Greek Μυστηρία a word ultimately derived from the root Μυ (MO) a sound produced by the opening of cl osed lips. It may be noted here that OM the sacred utterance of India is pronounced by exactly opposite methods. To remain before its inquirers silent, as Christ before his judges, is the only possible status regarding Samâdhi compa tible with the Truth. Samâdhi is the engineer who manipulates the engi ne. If you wish to discover how that engine is worked, go to him and not to the (ir)rational cogs, levers, and wheels; and as to explain the engineer in terms of his engine is to sin against the Holy Ghost, so to express in defi nite terms, outside symbolization, the state of Samâdhi which is inexpressible – is also to sin against the Word; for Samâdhi surpasses all rational quan tities including Egotism and Altruism,"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Time and Space. Passing to that state beyond progress, which is pure freedom and divine Will, man reaches the stage wh en he ceases to think empirically under the schemata of Time and Space. The mind at such moments reaches heights wherein a nother light succeeds to the light of experience; there is a mental “whirl ” which, though irrational to pure reason, has an incalculable value, proba bly depending on certain higher laws unknown to the rational world. When th e soul has reached this point, law, in the rational sense of the term, has c eased to have any existence, and it henceforth enters into direct comm union with the Good; which is its own law.

Huxley says: “The influence of diet on dreams; of stim ulants upon the fulness and the velocity of the stream of thought; the delirio us phantoms generated by disease, by hashish, or by alcohol; will occur to ev eryone as examples of the marvellous sensitiveness of the apparatus of idea tion to purely physical influences.”*2. *1.

Others again do not possess the stability of mind, the natural health and strength so necessary in this severe me ntal struggle, and as Ribot says: “It is all confined to an alienation, in the etymological sense, of certain states of consciousness which the ego does not c onsider as its own, but which it objectivates, and finally, by placing it out side itself, ends by attributing an actual existence independent of its ow n.”* Others attain but a glimpse.

I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe anything but the perception.*1.

Where then is the pow er, of which we pretend to be conscious?

No great attention to what passes in th e mind is needful to prove that our trains of thought are neither to be arrested, nor even permanently controlled, by our desires or emoti ons. Nevertheless, they are largely influenced by them. In the presence of a strong desire, or emotion, the stream of thought no longer flows on in a straight course, but seems, as it were, to eddy round the idea of that which is the object of the emotion. Every one who has “eat en his bread in sorrow,” knows how strangely the current of ideas whir ls about the conception of the object of regret or remorse as a centre; every now and then, indeed, breaking away into the new tracts suggest ed by passing associations (b), but still returning to the central thought.

And as the spontaneous flashing of the heavens is a grander si ght than the watching of an artificial thunderstorm produced in a halfpenny te st tube; so in the West, though the state arrived at was one si milar to that worked out on Eastern principles, it was intensely more regal and majestic; for whilst the rishi sat in a howling jungle, contemplating the tip of his nose, the mystic philosopher was groping in the charnel-house of death, midst dr ear effigies of the living, and dread symbols of the dead, and lit the same triple flame of glory, losing himself in that poetic vision of rapture, so entirely unknown in the prosaic East. And curious to say, that while the East wa s applying mechanical means to attain a divine illumination, the West arri ved at a similar position on the circumference of eternity, by a diam etrically opposite road; applying the whole of her artificial faculties to a pe rfecting of her mate rial needs – hence the growing triumphs of the West... “And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord: and he brought the shadow te n degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz” (2 Kings, 20).

So has it been with all those who ha ve realized their divine self. St. Augustine symbolizes it under a divine act of copulation.* *Curious to say in the case of women ( e.g. , Schwester Katrei and Nun Gertrude), illumination and ecstasy at once symbolize them selves under the forms of neurosis, as in the East generally the illuminati symboli ze divine union under the grossest forms of sexual pathology.

I may here point out that not only in th eir Sapphic brilliance, but also in their mirrored mysticism, so many of Crowley’s poems are akin to the esoteric teaching of the Sufi poets of Persia, such as Jeláladdín and Jámi. A very beautiful parable of Jeláladdín runs as follows: One knocked at the Beloved’s Door; a nd a Voice asked from within, “Who is there?” and he answered, “It is I.” Then th e Voice said, “This Hous e will not hold Me and"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Thee.” And the Door was not opened.

As do the following lines of Jámi: Gaze, till Gazing out of Gazing Grew a BEING Her I gaze on, SHE and I no more, but in One Undivided Being blended. All that is not one must ever Suffer with the Wound of Absence; And whoever in Love’s City Enters, finds but Room for ONE, And but in ONENESS Union.

We will now show the chie f means which were employed by the adepts of the West in gaining this end. Though, as it would be only natural to expect, the Christian Church strongly repudiated the idea of connection be tween her Ceremonial practices and those of Magic,*1. for she has always denied relationship to those who live outside the brothel, the asylum, and th e jail; and further, in this case, burnt and destroyed countless th ousands of innocent and erudite persons on the authority of a divine book she had rendered obscene by her whorish thumbmarks; nevertheless, in spite of her Lodges and her l ogic, the greatest of her sons and daughters, as we ha ve already seen, were mystics and magicians pure and simple; this no doubt accounts for the comparative safety and dignity with which the early fathers travelled in the East, and the greatest of her ceremonies were entirel y of a magical nature. I defy any one to find any essential di fference between the Spir itual Exercises of St. Ignatius and the practices of Raja Y oga; space here doe s not permit me to draw parallels, though I have collected a considerable number.

But the crystal wine of Iacchus had long since soured in the thunders of those dark days, yet, with death-pale lips, he drank the blood-red wine of witchcraft. “Hark! the cock crows!

With skulls and knives she keeps control (O Mother Kali!) of my soul.* *Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 97. Crowley’s interpretation of Ceremonial Magic, the getting back to the old gods, so to say, is lucidly described, under the terms of a rational system, in his introduction to the “Goetia” of King Solomon. It is as follows: I am not concerned to deny the objective reality of all “magical” phenomena; if they are illusi ons, they are at least as real as many unquestioned facts of daily lif e; and, if we follow Herbert Spencer, they are at least evidence of some cause. Now, this fact is our base. What is the cause of my illusion of seeing a spirit in the triangle of Art? Every smatterer, every expert in psychology, will answer “That cause lies in your brain.” English children are taught ( pace the Education Act) that the Universe lies in infinite Space; Hi ndu children, in the Akása, which is the same thing. Those Europeans who go a little d eeper learn from Fichte, that the phenomenal Universe is the creation of the Ego; Hindus, or Europeans studying under Hindu Guru s, are told, that by Akása is meant the Chitakása. The Chitakása is situated in the “Third Eye,” i.e. , in the brain. By assuming highe r dimensions of space, we can assimilate this fact to Realism; but we have no need to take so much trouble. This being true for the ordinary Universe, that all sense- impressions are dependent on change s in the brain, we must include illusions, which are after all sense- impressions as much as “realities” are in the class of “phenomen a dependent on brain changes.”"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Magical phenomena, however, co me under a special sub-class, since they are willed, and their cause is the series of “real” phenomena called the operations of ceremonial Magic. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

In every the wisest Soul lies a whole world of internal Madness, an authentic Demon-Empire; out of whic h, indeed, his world of Wisdom has been creatively built together, and now rests there, as on its dark foundations does a habitable flowery Earth-rind.” — Sartor Resartus . *2.

In the East it is arrived at by meditati on, “the absolute restraint of the mind to the contemplation of a single object , whether gross, fine, or altogether spiritual”* in the West by ceremonial magic. *Berashith, vol. ii, p. 242. Now true magical ceremonial is entirely directed to attain this end, and forms a magnificent gym nasium for those who are not already finished mental athletes . By act, word, and thought, both in quantity and quality, the one obj ect of the ceremony is being constantly indicated. Every fumi gation, purification, banishing, invocation, evocation, is chiefly a reminder of a single purpose, until the supreme moment arrives, and ev ery fibre of the body, every force- channel of the mind, is strained, a nd in one overwhelming rush of the Will in the direction desired. Such is the real purport of all the apparently fantastic directions of Solomon, Abramelin, and other sages of repute. When a man has e voked and mastered such forces as Taphtatharath, Belial, Amaimon, and the great powers of the elements, then he may safely be permitted to begin to try to stop thinking. For needless to say, th e universe, including the thinker, exists only by virtue of the thinker’s thought* (Berkeley, Hume, etc.). *Berashith, vol. ii, p. 242. “These are real, these illusions: I am of them, false or frail.”*1. And they cannot be overthrown even by travelle rs in Morocco who administer to possessed Moors Seidlitz powde rs, first giving the alkali, and then the acid, the patients firmly believing that in the effervescence consequent to the evolution of gas, the evil spirit has b een dislodged from their interior. For if they firmly believe the spirit was disl odged, there can not be the slightest doubt on this point, the spirit being a te mporary part of the “brain,” as all other “ideas” must be from the idea of “constipation“ – which Seidlitz powders will also remove – to th at of Heaven and Hell,*2. which Swedenborg also dislodges. *1.

At last we have arrived at the close of a difficult yet intensely interesting journey. Crowleyanity ha s led us through more marvels than Dante ever bore witness to in the “Paradiso” a nd the “Inferno.” His may have been a Divine Comedy, but here before us ha s been unrolled the vast drama of a Sublime Tragedy: “All arguments are argum ents in a circle,” and there is a home to which we all one day shall have to return, to the celestial home of crowning glory. Some spur and spare not , others linger, a nd others dawdle in the by-ways and lanes of existence, ye t the most tardy will one day catch up with the fastest and a time will come wh en the tortoise will be one with the hare. All is one, either a mass of impressions (Loc ke, Hume), or a mass of consciousness (Berkeley and Fichte), a ll is unity, controversy is verbal, dispute the mere beating of the wi nds with a tattered fan. Religion is bankrupt, philosophy is bankrupt, science is bankrupt, none will be discharged, we must fend for ourselves... Hark! We are the poets! We are the children of wood and stream, of mist and mountain, of sun and wind! We adore the moon and the stars, and go into the London street s at midnight seeking Their kisses as our birthright. We are the Gr eeks – and God grant ye all, my brothers, to be as happy in your love s! and to us the rites of Eleusis should open the door of Heaven, and we shall enter and see God face to face. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Under the stars I go forth, my brot hers, and drink of that lustral dew: I will return, my brothers, when I have seen God face to face, and read within those eternal eyes the secret that shall make you free. Then will I choose you and test you and instruct you in the Mysteries of Eleusis, oh ye brave h earts, and cool eyes, and trembling lips! I will put a live coal upon your lips, and flowers upon your eyes, and a sword in your hearts, and ye also shall see God face to face. Thus shall we give back its yout h to the world, for like tongues of triple flame we shall brood upon the Great Deep – Hail unto the Lords of the Groves of Eleusis!* *Eleusis, vol. iii, pp. 229, 230.
