[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"To The Reader The reason why a special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution is that this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation, and therefore the existence of God, during the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. Therefore, showing that this theory is a deception is a very important duty, which is strongly related to the religion . It is imperative that this important service be rendered to everyone. Some of our readers may find the chance to read only one of our books. Therefore, we think it appropriate to spare a chapter for a summary of this subject. In all the books by the author, faith-related issues are explained in the light of the Koranic verses and people are invited to learn God's words and to live by them. All the subjects that concern God's verses are explained in such a way as to leave no room for doubt or question marks in the reader's mind. The sincere, plain and fluent style employed ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand the books. This effective and lucid narrative makes it possible to read them in a single sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts recounted in these books and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. This book and all the other works of the author can be read individually or discussed in a group at a time of conversation. Those readers who are willing to profit from the books will find discussion very useful in the sense that they will be able to relate their own reflections and experiences to one another. In addition, it will be a great service to the religion to contribute to the presentation and reading of these books, which are written solely for the good pleasure of God. All the books of the author are extremely convincing. For this reason, for those who want to communicate the religion to other people, one of the most effective methods is to encourage them to read these books. It is hoped that the reader will take time to look through the review of other books on the final pages of the book, and appreciate the rich source of material on faith-related issues, which are very useful and a pleasure to read. In these books, you will not find, as in some other books, the personal views of the author, explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, doubt-creating, and pessimistic accounts that create deviations in the heart."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"F F A A S S C C I I S S M M T T H H E E B B L L O O O O D D Y Y I I D D E E O O L L O O G G Y Y O O F F D D A A R R W W I I N N I I S S M M H H A A R R U U N N Y Y A A H H Y Y A A April, 2002"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"About The Author The author, who writes under the pen-name HARUN YAHYA, was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he then studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, the invalidity of their claims and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and bloody ideologies such as fascism and communism. His pen-name is made up of the names \"Harun\" (Aaron) and \"Yahya\" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the cover of the author's books has a symbolic meaning linked to the their contents. This seal represents the Koran, the last Book and the last word of God, and our Prophet, the last of all the prophets. Under the guidance of the Koran and Sunnah, the author makes it his main goal to disprove each one of the fundamental tenets of godless ideologies and to have the \"last word\", so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used as a sign of his intention of saying this last word. All these works by the author centre around one goal: to convey the message of the Koran to people, thus encouraging them to think about basic faith-related issues, such as the existence of God, His unity and the hereafter, and to display the decrepit foundations and perverted works of godless systems. Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian, and they have been enjoyed by readers all over the world. Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people putting their faith in God and in many others gaining a deeper insight into their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style employed give these books a distinct touch which directly strikes any one who reads or examines them. Immune to objections, these works are characterised by their features of rapid"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"effectiveness, definite results and irrefutability. It is unlikely that those who read these books and give a serious thought to them can any longer sincerely advocate the materialistic philosophy, atheism and any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to advocate, this will be only a sentimental insistence since these books have refuted these ideologies from their very basis. All contemporary movements of denial are ideologically defeated today, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity of the Koran. The author certainly does not feel proud of himself; he merely intends to serve as a means in one's search for God's right path. Furthermore, no material gain is sought in the publication of these works. Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which open the \"eyes\" of the heart and guide them in becoming more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books which create confusion in peoples' minds, lead man into ideological chaos, and which, clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in peoples' hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Koran. The success, impact and sincerity this service has attained are manifest in the reader's conviction. One point needs to be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty and conflict, and all the ordeals the majority of people undergo is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. These things can only come to an end with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by ensuring that everybody knows about the wonders of creation and Koranic morality, so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which forces people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is clear that this service has to be provided more speedily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. It is no exaggeration to say that the collection of books by Harun Yahya have assumed this leading role. By the Will of God, these books will be the means through which people in the 21st century will attain the peace and bliss, justice and happiness promised in the Koran."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Translated by Carl Rossini Edited by David Livingstone Published by KULTUR PUBLISHING Catalcesme sk.

It spread rapidly across the world in the wake of World War I, with fascist regimes coming to power in Germany and Italy in particular, but also in such countries as Greece, Spain and Japan, where the people suffered greatly from the oppressive and violent methods employed by their governments. Against this oppression and violence, they could do little more than cower before it. The fascist dictator and his administration heading such systems, where brute force, aggression, bloodshed and violence were the rule of the day, sent waves of terror throughout the society with their secret police and fascist militia, paralyzing the people with fear. Furthermore, fascist administration was implemented in almost all levels of society, from education to culture, religion to art, the governmental structure to the military system, and from the policing organizations to peoples' private lives. Ultimately, World War II, initiated by fascists, was one of the gravest calamities in the history of mankind, leaving as many as 55 million dead. However, fascism is not an ideology found only in history books. Although today there are no states that call themselves fascist or who practice it openly, there are, nevertheless, in many countries in the world, governments, political groups and parties who follow fascistic policies. Though the names and tactics have changed, they continue to inflict similar suffering on their people. There is also a possibility that the coming deterioration of social conditions could lead to further growth in the support for fascism. For that reason, fascism is a continuing threat to humanity. This book has been written to confront this impending danger. It is intended to expose fascist tendencies that arise under various methods and forms, and to reveal their true root and aim. Another goal of this book is to remove the \"religious\" facade that fascism sometimes hides behind, and to reveal it as a system completely opposed to true religion. In order to cure a sickness, it is first necessary to identify the virus that causes it, to then fight it, and find an antidote to it. In this way, the conditions that enable it to thrive can be eliminated, thus doing away with the sickness itself.

As we shall come to see throughout this book, the fundamental principle behind fascism today is Darwinism, which is deceptively portrayed as a scientific theory although it is not. Nevertheless, Darwinism, which professes such claims as \"human beings are developed animals,\" \"Some races have been left behind in the evolutionary process,\" and \"through survival of the fittest, the strong survive and the weak need be eliminated,\" has been the source of numerous harmful ideologies throughout the 20th century, and, especially, fascism. Therefore, as we shall be exploring in detail, Darwinism bears much of the responsibility for the oppression and violence that has been brought about. Even if we live in a country where there is not a fascist movement or fascist practices, where those who have sought to promote them have been checked, and where Darwinism has not been widely accepted, we must not lower our guard. All people of conscience must engage themselves in an ideological struggle against all forces and ideologies that cause mischief in the world and aim to destroy peace and order. God has ordered man to live in peace and security. In the Koran He commands: You who believe! Enter absolutely into peace (Islam). Do not follow in the footsteps of Satan. He is an outright enemy to you.

However, in the 20th century, the Nazis deliberately bombed civilian populations, as well as systematically murdering them in concentration camps. These terrible scenes of Jews and other innocent inmates in Nazi concentration camps and ghettos are but a few examples of Nazi brutality against civilian populations. This barbarity was based more in support of an ideology than as part of a military strategy. This ideology was a barbaric one, which claimed that there was a \"struggle for survival\" among the races, and that this was a \"law of nature.\" Its origin is found in the paganism of ancient times and in the so-called Darwinist \"science.\""},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"I I N N T T R R O O D D U U C C T T I I O O N N I I N N T T R R O O D D U U C C T T I I O O N N F ascism is an oppressive political movement that first developed in Italy after 1919, and then in various countries in Europe, as a reaction to the political and social changes brought about by World War I. The name comes from the Latin word fasces , meaning a bundle of rods tied around an axe which symbolized authority in ancient Rome. The term \"fascism\" was first used in Italy by the 1922-1924 government led by Benito Mussolini. And the figure of a bundle of sticks tied around an axe became the emblem of the first fascist party. After Italy, fascist governments came to power in Germany from 1933 to 1945, and in Spain from 1939 to 1975. After World War II, dictatorial regimes set up in South America and other undeveloped countries were generally described as fascist. To understand the philosophy of fascism, we may consider the description that Mussolini wrote for the Italian Encyclopedia in 1932: Fascism, the more it considers and observes the future and the development of humanity quite apart from political considerations of the moment, believes neither in the possibility nor the utility of perpetual peace. It thus repudiates the doctrine of Pacifism—born of a renunciation of the struggle and an act of cowardice in the face of sacrifice. War alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the peoples who have courage to meet it. All other trials are substitutes, which never really put men into the position where they have to make the great decision—the alternative of life or death.... [The Fascist] conceives of life as duty and struggle and conquest, but above all for others—those who are at hand and those who are far distant, contemporaries, and those who will come after. 1 Evidently, the main idea behind fascism, as stressed by Mussolini, is Darwinist conflict and war. For, as we saw in the A lictor from ancient Rome. He walked in front of Roman magistrates and held a bundle of rods in his hand as a symbol of power and authority."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The first fascist dictator of the 20th century, Benito Mussolini, ruled Italy between 1922 and 1944."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM foreword, Darwinism claims that \"the strong survive, the weak are eliminated,\" for which reason it suggests that people need to be in a constant state of struggle in order to survive. Fascism, having been developed from this idea, promotes the belief that a nation can only advance through war, and regards peace as an element that retards progress. The same line of thought was expressed by Vladimir Jabotinsky, widely regarded as one of the foremost representatives of Zionist Jews, and proponent of the Israeli radical right, who summed up the fascistic ideology in a statement he made in the 1930s: Stupid is the person who believes in his neighbor, good and loving as the neighbor may be. Justice exists only for those whose fists and stubbornness make it possible for them to realize it . . . Do not believe anyone, be always on guard, carry your stick always with you—this is the only way of surviving in this wolfish battle of all against all. 2 As is evident from these words, and as we shall be seeing in some detail in the pages that follow, fascism is actually an ideology that is set in accordance with \"the law of the jungle\" as developed by Darwinism. Another feature of fascism to consider is that it is a nationalistic and aggressive ideology based on racism. This nationalism is far removed from mere love of country. In the aggressive nationalism of fascism, one aspires to see his own nation dominating others, and utterly humiliating them, and has no compunction about inflicting great suffering upon its own people in the process. Moreover, fascistic nationalism consists of using war, occupation, massacre and bloodshed as tools towards such political aims. In the same manner as fascist regimes use such means to dominate other nations, they also use force and oppression against their own nation. Fascism's basic social policy is insistence on an idea, and obliging people to accept it. Fascism aims at making individuals and all of society think and behave in the same way. In order to attain this end, Mussolini adopted the Roman axe to symbolize his power.

It denounces as an enemy anyone who does not comply with its ideas, even going as far as genocide, as in the case of Nazi Germany. The above has been just a brief description of the nature of the social structure and political structure of fascism. But the real problem is in identifying where the idea of fascism was born, how it then spread, came to power, and took hold of entire nations. It is important to understand these, because, although people think that fascism was done away with at the end of World War II, it still rears its head in a number of forms. Fascism is not just a political system, it is also a mentality, and even if this mentality no longer leads to the establishment of political regimes, such as Nazi Germany, or Mussolini's Italy, it nevertheless continues to inflict suffering on people all over the world. So we shall now examine the roots of the fascist mentality, and how it was able to grow in strength to the point of outraging the whole world in the The axe and a bundle of rods symbolizing fascism in an illustration with Mussolini's signature.

The foundation of fascism was laid by a number of European thinkers in the 19th century, and put into practice in the 20th century by such countries as Italy and Germany. Other countries, which were influenced by fascism or adopted it, \"imported\" the ideology from Europe. So, in order to examine the roots of fascism, we must turn to the history of Europe. European history has gone through several stages and periods. But, in the broadest sense, we can divide it into three fundamental periods: 1) The pre-Christian (pagan) period. 2) The period when Christianity assumed cultural dominance in Europe. 3) The post-Christian (materialist) period. The idea of a \"Post-Christian\" period may strike many readers as odd, because Christianity is still by far the majority religion in European society. But Christianity is no longer a dominant aspect of European culture: all that remains is lip-service paid to it.

In other words, fascism is a product of paganism, and was later reinforced with the rise of materialism. Fascist ideology or practice was non-existent throughout the thousand or so years when Christianity dominated Europe.

Christianity, which calls people to love, compassion, self- sacrifice, and humility, is the complete antithesis of fascism. Christianity is originally a divine religion, incepted by the Prophet Jesus. After Jesus, it departed from its original form with some applications and interpretations. Nevertheless, it has managed to maintain certain aspects of the essence of the true religion, with concepts such love, compassion, sacrifice, and humility, as set out above. Let us now have a brief look at pre-Christian Europe and examine the roots of fascism. Fascists in the Pagan World Essentially, as a pagan culture, religion in pre-Christian Europe was polytheistic. Europeans believed the false gods they worshipped represented various forces or aspects of life, and most important were the gods of war, much like those who have appeared in just about every pagan society. This prestige the gods of war enjoyed in pagan belief was the result of these societies' regarding violence as sacred. Pagan peoples were essentially barbaric and lived in a state of permanent warfare. To kill and spill blood in the name of their nation was seen as a sacred duty. Savagery and violence of almost every kind could find justification in paganism. There was no ethical foundation to forbid violence or brutality. Even Rome, thought of as the most \"civilized\" state in the pagan world, was a place where people were made to fight to the death or torn to pieces by wild animals. The Emperor Nero came to power by having countless numbers of people killed, including his own mother, wife, and stepbrother. He had Christians devoured by wild animals in the arena, and tortured thousands of people simply because of their beliefs. An example of his cruelty was his setting the city of Rome on fire, as he played the lyre and watched the horrible scene from a window in his palace. Though Rome was immersed in a culture of violence, the barbarian and pagan nations of the Nero: an example of a \"fascist\" lover of violence from the pagan world."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE CULTURE OF VIOLENCE IN THE PAGAN WORLD In pagan Rome, people were torn apart by wild animals, or else made to fight to the death in the Colosseum. The audiences, who had fallen prey to paganism's immorality and degeneracy, watched this violence with great enjoyment and excitement."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 The Origin Of The Fascist Mentality north, such as the Vandals, Goths, and Visigoths, were still more savage. They strove to wreak devastation on each other, as well as plundering Rome. The pagan world was a place where violence prevailed, where the use of brutality of every kind was encouraged, and where there was no consideration at all for ethics. The best example in the pagan world of a \"fascist\" system, in the modern sense, was the Greek city-state of Sparta. Sparta: A Model for All Fascists Sparta was a military state, dedicated to war and violence, and alleged to have been founded by Lycurgus in the 8th century BC. The Spartans implemented highly regimented system of education. Under the Spartan system, the state was very much more important than the individual. Peoples' lives were measured according to whether or not they would be of use to the state. Strong, healthy male children were dedicated to the state, while unhealthy babies were abandoned to the mountains to die. (This Spartan practice was taken as an example by the Nazis of Germany, and it was claimed, under the further influence of Darwinism, that the sickly needed to be eliminated to maintain a \"healthy and superior race.\") In Sparta, parents were responsible for raising their sons until the age of seven. From then, until the age of 12, children were placed in teams of 15, and those who stood out for their abilities were selected to be leaders. Children spent their time strengthening their bodies and preparing for war by practicing sports. Lycurgus, the founder of the Spartan State The pagan world possessed a culture in which only brute force was seen to matter. Like the Romans, northern barbarian pagan tribes such as the Vandals, Goths and Visigoths took great pleasure in bloodshed."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"SPARTA: THE FIRST FASCIST STATE The Greek city-state of Sparta was a brutal war machine.

The only songs children were allowed to sing and learn were those of war and violence. (The education of children from the age of four under the fascism of Mussolini and Hitler was very similar). The Spartan custom was to indoctrinate people in the spirit of war, at the expense of art, literature, and education. One of the most important thinkers to have offered detailed statements about Sparta was the famous Greek philosopher Plato. Although he lived in Athens, which was governed democratically, he was impressed with the fascist system in Sparta, and in his books portrayed Sparta as a model state. Because of Plato's fascist tendencies, Karl Popper, one of the foremost thinkers From infancy, Spartan soldiers were trained to know only war. Shedding blood was their only aim in life."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27 The Origin Of The Fascist Mentality of the 20th century, in his famous book, The Open Society and Its Enemies , describes him as the first source of inspiration for oppressive regimes, and an enemy of open society. In support of his contention, Popper refers to how Plato calmly defended the killing of infants in Sparta, and describes him as the first theoretical proponent of \"eugenics\" : ...[I]t is important that the master class should feel as one superior master race. 'The race of the guardians must be kept pure', says Plato (in defence of infanticide), when developing the racialist argument that we breed animals with great care while neglecting our own race, an argument which has been repeated ever since. (Infanticide was not an Athenian institution; Plato, seeing that it was practised at Sparta for eugenic reasons, concluded that it must be ancient and therefore good.) He demands that the same principles be applied to the breeding of the master race as are applied, by an experienced breeder, to dogs, horses or birds. 'If you did not breed them in this way, don't you think that the race of your birds or dogs would quickly degenerate?' Plato argues; and he draws the conclusion that 'the same principles apply to the race of men'. The racial qualities demanded from a guardian or from an auxiliary are, more specifically, those of a sheep-dog. 'Our warrior-athletes .. must be vigilant like watch-dogs', demands Plato, and he asks: 'Surely, there is no difference, so far as their natural fitness for keeping guard is concerned, between a gallant youth and a well-bred dog?' 3 These views of Plato, who regarded human beings as a species of animal, and proposed that they should be \"evolved\" through \"forced mating,\" came to the fore once again with the advent of Darwinism in the 19th century, and were implemented by the Nazis in the 20th. We shall be examining this in the pages that follow. While defending the Spartan model, Plato also advanced another aspect of fascism, the state use of repression to administer society. In Plato's view, this pressure should be so comprehensive that people should be unable to think of A bronze statue of a Spartan soldier going to war."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM anything apart from the orders of the state, and behave in complete adherence to state policy, forsaking the use of their intelligence and free will. The following words of Plato, quoted by Popper as a complete statement of the fascist mentality, describe the structure of fascist order: The greatest principle of all is that nobody, whether male or female, should be without a leader. Nor should the mind of anybody be habituated to letting him do anything at all on his own initiative; neither out of zeal, nor even playfully. But in war and in the midst of peace— to his leader he shall direct his eye and follow him faithfully. And even in the smallest matter he should stand under leadership. For example, he should get up, or move, or wash, or take his meals .. only if he has been told to do so. In a word, he should teach his soul, by long habit, never to dream of acting independently, and to become utterly incapable of it. 4 These ideas and practices, promoted by the Spartans, as they were by Plato, exemplify the fundamental characteristics of fascism—the perception of human beings as mere animals, fanatical racism, the promotion of war and conflict, state-sponsored repression, and \"formal indoctrination.\" Similar fascistic practices are also discoverable in other pagan societies. The system set up by the pharaohs , the rulers of ancient Egypt, is in certain aspects comparable to Spartan fascism. The Egyptian pharaohs built up state systems founded on ideals of military discipline, and used them to oppress even their own people. Rameses II, the tyrannical Egyptian ruler, who is believed to have lived in the time of the Prophet Moses , ordered that all male Jewish children be killed, a cruelty reminiscent of the infanticide in Sparta, and the psychological forms of oppression he inflicted on his own subjects also recalls the fascistic system described by Plato. As God revealed in the Koran, Pharaoh offered his subjects the following tyrannical ultimatum: \"...I only show Plato: An enemy of \"open society\" A Spartan soldier"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"you what I see myself and I only guide you to the path of rectitude.\" (Koran, 40:29) And he threatened those magicians who rejected his pagan beliefs and led to the true religion by following Moses, \"...Have you believed in him before I authorized you to do so?...I will cut off your alternate hands and feet and then I will crucify every one of you.\" (Koran, 7:123-124) Fascism's Retreat in the Face of Religion The fascistic pagan culture which dominated Europe disappeared in stages with the spread of Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, first to Rome, and then to all of Europe. Christianity carried to European society the basic ethical characteristics of the true religion revealed to man by the Prophet Jesus. Europe, which had once encouraged violence, conflict and bloodshed as sacred, and been composed of different tribes, races and city-states constantly at war with one another, underwent an important change. 1) Racial and tribal wars disappeared: In the pagan world, all tribes and races saw each other as enemies, and there was constant fighting between them. Each pagan society had its own gods and totems which it invented, waging war in their name. With the coming of Christianity, there was a single belief, culture, and even language in Europe as a whole, thus the conflicts of the pagan world came to an end. 2) Peace and compassion came to be considered sacred, instead of violence: In pagan societies, inflicting bloodshed, suffering and torture was seen as heroic, actions that appeased the imaginary \"gods of war.\" Under Christianity however, European societies learned that people should love each other and exercise compassion (even for their enemies), and that the shedding of blood was a great sin in the sight of God. 3) The perception of human beings as a species of animal disappeared: The Spartans regarding their warriors as equivalent to \"watch- dogs\" was an extension of the \"animist\" belief widespread in pagan societies. Animism implied ascribing a soul to nature and animals. According to animism, there was no difference between a human being and an animal, or even a plant. But when religion came to predominate, this superstition disappeared, and European societies realized that human beings possessed a soul given to them by God, and were completely different from animals, and could not, therefore, be subject to the same laws. These three aspects of paganism—racism, bloodshed, and equating human beings with animals—are also the basic characteristics of fascism.

In the Middle East, the same victory was achieved by Islam over Arab paganism. Before the advent of Islam, the Arabs (and other Middle Eastern and Central Asian societies) were warlike, blood-thirsty, and racist. The Spartans' barbaric \"abandonment of unwanted children to die\" was adopted by the pagan Arabs, in the form of burying their female children alive. The Koran mentions this savage practice: When the baby girl buried alive is asked for what crime she was killed. (Koran, 81: 8-9) When any of them is given the good news of (the birth of a daughter) the very thing which he himself has ascribed to the All-Merciful his face darkens and he is furious. (Koran, 43:17) The Arabs, and other Middle Eastern and Central Asian cultures, were only transformed into peaceful, civilized, intelligent societies opposed to bloodshed after they were enlightened by Islam. Thus they were freed from the old tribal wars and nomadic savagery, and found peace and stability in religion. Neo-Paganism and the Birth of Fascism Although European paganism was suppressed by Christianity, it did not die out. It survived under the guise of various teachings, movements, and secret societies, such as the Freemasons, and re-emerged in a definite form in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. A number of European thinkers, influenced by the works of ancient Greek philosophers, such as Plato or Aristotle, began to revive concepts from the pagan world. This neo-pagan current became increasingly influential, and in the 19th century, surpassed Christianity and imposed itself on Europe. It will be useful to examine the main outline of this lengthy process here, without necessarily going into details. The vanguard of neo-pagan movement were those thinkers known as \"humanists.\" Influenced by ancient Greek sources, they tried to spread the pagan philosophies of such philosophers as Plato and Aristotle. The belief they professed in the name \"humanism\" was a perverted philosophy that ignored the existence of God and man's 30 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM Aristotle"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 The Origin Of The Fascist Mentality responsibilities to Him, but instead considered man a great, superior, and independent being. The influences of humanism took on further aspects with the philosophy of the Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries. Enlightenment philosophers were influenced by and fiercely defended materialism, an idea which developed in ancient Greece. (Materialism is a dogmatic philosophy put forward by such Greek thinkers as Leucippus and Democritus, positing that only matter exists). THE LIBERTY CAP: The picture below was thought to represent the unity and indivisibility of the republic established after the French revolution.

As a result of intensive Jacobin propaganda during the fiercest days of the revolution, the \"rejection of Christianity\" movement became widespread.

These pagan tendencies were portrayed among the revolutionaries by a number of symbols. The liberty cap worn by the revolutionary guards of the French Revolution, and which often became a symbol of the revolution, descended from the pagan world and the worship of Mithras. 5 The rebirth of paganism, and the beginning of its intellectual dominance over Europe, also led the way to a rebirth of fascism, itself a system rooted in the Robespierre The Cordeliers Club card belonging to Robespierre, ruthless leader of the French revolution.

In fact, Nazi Germany, with its system reminiscent of that practiced in Sparta, was based on paganism. Towards this development, a number of fundamental cultural changes were necessary between the French Revolution, at the end of the 18th century, and Nazi Germany, at the beginning of the 20th. These important changes were brought about by a number of thinkers during the 19th century. The most important of these was Charles Darwin. Darwinism and the Revival of the  Pagan Superstition of \"Evolution\" One of the superstitions to survive from paganism, but which only began to be revived in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, was the \"theory of evolution,\" a theory which maintained that all living things came into existence as the result of pure chance, and then developed from one to another. Unaware of the existence of God, and worshipping false idols which they themselves devised, pagans answered the question of how life came about with the concept of \"evolution.\" This notion is first seen in inscriptions from ancient Sumeria, but was given shape in ancient Greece. Pagan philosophers such as Thales, Anaximander and Empedocles, claimed that living things, in other words human beings, animals and plants, formed themselves from such inanimate substances as air, fire and water. According to their theories, the first living things suddenly emerged in water and then adapted to the land. Thales had spent time in Egypt, where the superstition that \"living things formed themselves out of mud\" was widespread. The Egyptians believed that in this way the frogs which appeared when the waters of the Nile receded were formed. Thales adopted the superstition and attempted to present a number of arguments on its behalf, proposing that all living things came into existence by and of themselves. These claims of his were based solely in theory, not on experiment and observation. Other ancient Greek philosophers employed Thales, one of the first proponents of the myth of \"evolution.\""},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35 The Origin Of The Fascist Mentality the same method. Anaximander, a student of Thales, developed the theory of evolution, giving rise to to two important modes of Western thought. The first of these was that the universe had always existed and will continue to exist into eternity . The second was the idea that living things evolved from each other , an idea which had slowly begun to take shape in Thales' time. The first written work to discuss the theory of evolution was the classical poem On Nature , in which Anaximander wrote that creatures arose from slime that had been evaporated by the sun. He thought that the first animals lived in the sea and had prickly, scaly coverings. As these fish-like creatures evolved, they moved onto land, shed their scaly coverings, and became humans. 6 Books on philosophy describe how Anaximander shaped the foundation of the theory of evolution: We find that Anaximander of Miletus (611 B.C.-546 B.C.) advanced the traditional evolutionary idea, already quite common in his day, that life first evolved from a type of pre-biotic soup, helped along a bit by the rays of the sun. He believed that the first animals developed from sea slime which had been evaporated by the sun rays. He also believed that men were descended from fish. 7 In short, one of the two fundamental components of Darwinism, the claim that living things evolved from each other as a result of coincidences, was the product of pagan philosophy. The second important element of Darwin's theory, \"the struggle for survival,\" was also a pagan belief. It was the Greek philosophers who first suggested there was a war for survival between living things in nature. The notion of evolution, which the pagan philosophers had construed, not by experiment and observation, but by abstract reasoning, began to be reiterated in 18th century Europe. In pagan thought, the concept of evolution was called \"the Great Chain of Being,\" an idea that influenced such early That is because God—He is the Truth, and what you call upon besides Him is falsehood. God is the All- High, the Most Great. (Koran, 31:30)"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"With his theory defending war, conflict and the struggle for survival between the races, Charles Darwin prepared the ideological foundation of fascism."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37 The Origin Of The Fascist Mentality defenders of evolutionary theory as the French scientists Benoit de Maillet, Pierre de Maupertuis, Comte de Buffon and Jean Baptiste Lamarck . In his Histoire Naturelle, Buffon reveals himself as \"an exponent of the doctrine of the Great Chain of Being, with man being placed at the tope of the Chain.\" 8 Buffon's evolutionist views were passed on to Lamarck, and eventually inherited by Charles Darwin. Charles Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, was an evolutionist who adhered to pagan beliefs. Erasmus Darwin was one of the masters at the famous Canongate Kilwining Masonic lodge in Edinburgh, Scotland. He also had close connections to the Jacobins in France, and the Masonic organization of the Illuminati, whose founding principle was the hatred of religion. From the research he carried out in his eight-hectare botanical garden, he developed the ideas that would later go on to shape Darwinism, collected together in his books The Temple of Nature and Zoonomia. The concept of \"the temple of nature\" that Erasmus employed was a testament to the pagan beliefs he adopted, a repetition of the old pagan belief that nature possesses a creative force. Darwinism Prepared the Foundation for Fascism The myth of evolution, a legacy of Sumerian and Greek paganism, was introduced into the Western agenda with Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species , published in 1859. In this work, as in The Descent of Man , he discussed certain pagan concepts that had disappeared in Europe under Christianity, and gave them \"justification\" under the guise of science. We can outline these pagan concepts which he attempted to justify, thus preparing the groundwork for the development of fascism, as follows: 1) Darwinism provided the justification for racism: In the subtitle to The Origin of the Species, Darwin wrote: \"The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.\" With these words, Darwin was claiming that certain races in nature are more \"favored\" than others, in other words, that they were superior. He revealed this dimension of his ideas regarding human races in The Descent of Man , where he proposed that European white men were superior to Erasmus Darwin's book Zoonomia."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM races such as Africans, Asians and Turks, and were permitted to enslave them. 2) Darwinism provided a justification for bloodshed: As we have seen, Darwin proposed that a deadly \"struggle for survival\" takes place in nature. He claimed that this principle applied to both societies and to individuals, that it was a struggle to the death, and that it was quite natural for different races to try to eliminate others for its own sake. In short, Darwin described an arena where the only rule was violence and conflict, thus replacing the concepts of peace, cooperation, self-sacrifice, that had spread to Europe with the advent of Christianity. Darwinism thus resurrected the notion of the \"arena,\" an exhibition of violence devised in the pagan world (the Roman Empire). 3) Darwinism brought the concept of eugenics back into Western thought: The concept of maintaining racial supremacy through breeding, known as eugenics, which the Spartans had implemented, and which Plato defended by the words, \"Our warrior-athletes must be vigilant like watch-dogs,\" re-emerged in the Western world with Darwinism. Darwin devoted whole chapters in The Origin of Species to discussing the \"improvement of animal races,\" and maintained, in The Descent of Man , that human beings were a species of animal. Some time later, Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, was to take his uncle's claims a step further, and put forward the modern theory of eugenics. (Nazi Germany would be the first state to implement eugenics as official policy). As we have seen, Darwin's theory seems to be a concept that concerns only the science of biology, but it actually formed the basis for a totally new political outlook. Within a very short time, this new attitude was redefined as \"Social Darwinism.\" And as many historians have come to accept, Social Darwinism became the ideological basis of fascism and Nazism. The effect of Darwinism's portrayal of war and conflict as necessary has been analyzed in great detail in Paul Crook's Cambridge University publication Darwinism, War and History: The Debate over the Biology of War from 'The Origin of Species' to the First World War . Crook has made it clear that by The American historian Paul Crook's book 'Darwinism, War and History'"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39 The Origin Of The Fascist Mentality presenting war as a \"biological necessity,\" Darwinism formed both the formal justification for the First World War, as well as for various other warlike tendencies in fascism. Crook writes: Darwinist discourse conferred approval on a range of doctrines glorifying power, status, elitism, conquest and repression. Differences between cultures, genders, classes and races were reduced to fixed biological differences, imprinted in humans during eons of selective struggle. Darwin's conflict model generated militarist and racist extrapolations that conferred approval on war and imperial struggle as 'biological necessities'. 9 From such [Darwinist] assumptions, a variety of unpleasant consequences could be derived... War is rationalised... As Frederick Wertham has argued, if violence 'is all in human nature, and if we are all guilty, then nobody is guilty. And if we are all responsible, no man is responsible' ...The First World War was portrayed as the final vindication of the mythology of bestiality, encoded anew in terms of neo-Darwinian genetics and instinct theory. 10 Darwin thought of using Hobbes's phrase 'war of nature' as a heading to his chapter on struggle in his projected 'big book' Natural Selection ...He spoke of creatures 'overmastering' one another: 'through his continual use of highly dramatic language representing the life of organisms in nature as some heroic war, with attendant battles, victories, famine, dearth, and destruction, Darwin creates the image of a great literal struggle for existence – an image which pervades the Origin .' 11 As Crook has stated, Darwin not only proposed that human beings were a \"species\" descended from animals, but portrayed war and conflict as \"the origin of species.\" This fallacy would be the justification for the promotion You who believe! Enter absolutely into peace (Islam). Do not follow in the footsteps of Satan. He is an outright enemy to you.

Friedrich Nietzsche: An Ill Mind Who Praised Violence There was another 19th century thinker influenced by the neo-paganism attendant to Darwinism, and who expanded on it, thus helping to establish the foundation for fascism: The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche was born in a village near Leipzig in 1844, and was fascinated by Greek culture, learning Greek at an early age. In 1868, he began studying philosophy in the Swiss city of Basel. Nietzsche hated divine religions, such as Christianity, Islam and Judaism, but was fascinated by the pagan culture of ancient Greece. He formed a close friendship in Basel with Wagner, the best- known composer of the age. Wagner, who had come to fame with his Die Götterdämmerung (The Twilight of the Gods), was a German racist who was also fascinated by pagan culture and hated divine religions. (Wagner would be regarded as Germany's greatest cultural genius throughout the Hitler period). Nietzsche's publisher, Peter Gast, called Nietzsche \"one of the fiercest anti-Christians and atheists.\" 12 Another testament to Nietzsche's hatred of religion is the title of his book Anti-Christ . In his book Thus Spake Zarathustra , he tried to set up an ethical system beyond divine religion. According to H. F. NIETZSCHE, A FANATICAL OPPONENT OF RELIGION Nietzsche was influenced by the neo- pagan ideas brought about by the popularity of Darwin's theory, and laid the foundations of fascism. Nietzsche was a fierce enemy of religion, and his books Anti-Christ and Thus Spake Zarathustra, are clear evidence of his interest in paganism."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41 The Origin Of The Fascist Mentality Peters, Nietzsche's biographer, his philosophy rested on Roman and Greek paganism, and in his writings he called for \"a new Caesar\" to transform the world. 13 Nietzsche had a particular hatred of the ethical views of Christianity, Islam and Judaism. In his opinion, concepts such as love, compassion and humility, must be abandoned and replaced with a so-called \"master morality\" which accepted the warlike and ruthless state of nature. In Thus Spake Zarathustra , he wrote, \"Of all that is written I love only what a man has written with his blood. Write with blood, and you will experience that blood is spirit.\" 14 Nietzsche was also a racist. He maintained that one part of mankind was composed of übermensch (superman) , and that the others had to serve and obey them. Furthermore, he claimed that these so-called \"supermen\" would found an aristocratic world order, a theory which was put into practice by Hitler's armies at the start of the Second World War in 1939. These two aspects of Nietzsche's philosophy, his racism and reverence for violence, are allied closely to Darwinism. Nietzsche's thought was in fact strongly influenced by Darwin. Darwin's discrimination between the different races conformed closely to Nietzsche's perception of \"superior and inferior The German racist Wagner, known for his reverence of European paganism and hatred of divine religions, was regarded in Hitler's time as the greatest artistic genius. The likeness of those who disbelieve is that of someone who yells out to something which cannot hear—it is nothing but a cry and a call. Deaf—dumb—blind. They do not use their intellect. (Koran, 2:171)"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"peoples.\" Nietzsche also adapted his hatred of religion with the atheism of Darwin. In his book Darwin's Dangerous Idea, the Darwinist writer Daniel C. Dennett describes Darwin's influence on Nietzsche in the following way: \"Friedrich Nietzsche saw ...an even more cosmic message in Darwin:...If Nietzsche is the father of existentialism, then perhaps Darwin deserves the title of grandfather.\" 15 Dennett explains in great detail how Darwin and Nietzsche's ideas run parallel, and although Nietzsche seems to criticize Darwin in some of his writings, he gives many examples where Nietzsche clearly approves of Darwinist thought. After Nietzsche's death, the most important exponent of his philosophy was his sister, Elisabeth Nietzsche. She stood out as an avowed supporter of Nazi ideology in Hitler's Germany, and announced that her brother's model of the \"Superman\" had been brought to life by Hitler. 16 Nietzsche's influence on Nazi ideology is a reality that has been stressed by a great many historians. W. Cleon Skousen writes that, when \"Hitler wrote Mein Kampf , it was as though Nietzsche was speaking from the dead.\" 17 Another historian, George Lichtheim, writes, \"It is not too much to say that but for Nietzsche the SS—Hitler's shock troops and the core of the whole movement— would have lacked the inspiration to carry our their programs of mass murder in Eastern Europe.\" 18 As the historian H. F. Peters puts it, many have cursed Nietzsche as \"the father of fascism.\" 19 In his book, The Myth of the 20 th Century , the Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg openly praised Nietzsche. Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth), the youth wing of the Nazi movement, took Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra as a sacred text. Adolf Hitler had a special monument erected in Nietzsche's memory, and incepted the foundations of an educational center and library \"where German youth could be taught Nietzsche's doctrine of a master 42 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM According to the historian W.

Nietzsche's influence was not limited to Germany, it was also important in Italy, the birthplace of fascism. The poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, who may be regarded as the inspiration behind Mussolini, was greatly influenced by Nietzsche's philosophy. 21 Historians note that D'Annunzio's successor, Benito Mussolini acknowledged a debt of gratitude to Nietzsche as well. 22 The disasters inflicted upon mankind by fascism, which Nietzsche had inspired, provide historical evidence of just how harmful were the German philosopher's Darwinist ideas. Nietzsche, who opposed the divine morality that God revealed to mankind to show it the true path, and who proposed taking mankind to the modern age by replacing that morality with a brutal and oppressive society, had put forward Darwin's idea that man is a species of animal, and divided man into superior and inferior races, is the best example of the dark reality into which a lack of religion draws individuals and societies. Moreover, Nietzsche's life itself serves a warning. At 44 he was taken to a mental hospital, where his illness grew steadily worse, until he died raving mad. In 1902, a doctor called P. J. Mobius warned people \"that they should beware of Nietzsche, for his works were the products of a diseased brain.\" 23 But the Germans had great respect for the diseased philosophy of this disturbed mind, and so Nazi Germany was born. Nietzsche died of syphilis in a state of mental decay in a lunatic asylum. His private life was no less troubled or diseased than his philosophy. Like all those who have ever denied the existence of God, he met a very unpleasant end. Do not let those who rush headlong into disbelief sadden you. They do not harm God in any way. God desires to assign no portion to them in the hereafter. They will have a terrible punishment. Those who sell belief for disbelief do not harm God in any way. They will have a painful punishment.

(Koran, 3:176-178) Francis Galton: The Inspiration Behind Eugenic Killings Another important 19th century ideologue, who helped lay the foundations of 20th century fascism, was Francis Galton, known as the founder of the theory of \"eugenics.\" We have already discussed the concept of eugenics. It saw people as a species of animal and was the product of a mentality that imagined that the same rules applied to human beings as to animals. It held the belief that the human race could be developed by \"breeding methods,\" as with dogs or cattle. According to the theory, society's sick and deformed must be prevented from multiplying, (if necessary, they should even be killed), and healthy individuals should \"reproduce\" as much as possible to ensure strong and healthy later generations. This policy was one that had been implemented by the warrior city-state of Sparta, and defended by Plato. With the domination of Christianity, eugenics had found itself Hitlerjugend (The Hitler Youth), the Nazis' youth wing, considered Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra to be a \"sacred text.\""},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"relegated to the dusty shelves of history. Until Darwin's The Origin of Species was published. Darwin devoted the opening chapters of his book to the subject of raising animals, drew attention to those breeders who raised more productive breeds of horses and cattle, and then proposed, later on in the book, that these methods could be applied to human beings. Ultimately, it was Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, who widened the road of eugenics opened by his uncle, and who brought the subject onto the world stage by formulating it into a comprehensive program. As we might imagine, Galton was a fierce supporter and follower of Darwin. In his autobiography Memories of My Life , he writes: The publication in 1859 of The Origin of Specie s by Charles Darwin made a marked epoch in my own mental development, as it did in that of human thought generally. Its effect was to demolish a multitude of dogmatic barriers by a single stroke, and to arouse a spirit of rebellion against all ancient authorities whose positive and unauthenticated statements were contradicted by modern science. 24 The concepts that Galton denigrated as \"dogmatic barriers\" and \"ancient authorities\" were religious systems and beliefs. In other words, Darwin was the reason for Galton's \"great turning point,\" giving up his beliefs, and turning to the atheism and the racism, remnants of paganism. Other than Darwin, Galton was also influenced by another evolutionist ideologue, the French physicist Paul Broca, who proposed that human intelligence was directly related to brain size and, hence, to the size of the head. In order to allegedly \"prove\" this, he tore up Paris graveyards and measured hundreds of skulls. Galton united Broca's superstition about brain size—which would subsequently be proved to be utterly wrong—and Charles Darwin's \"animal breeding\" philosophy. The result was the theory of \"eugenics,\" being that certain races of humanity are superior to others, and that those superior must be kept uncontaminated by those inferior. Galton first published his ideas in 1869, in his book Hereditary Genius . It discusses a number of \"geniuses\" in British history and claims that they bore pure racial characteristics. (Among these \"geniuses,\" he did not neglect to include his uncle, Charles Darwin). In accordance to his claim, Galton then suggested that the English nation possessed an inherently superior blood to other races, and that steps needed to be taken to protect that blood from contamination. These theories he considered to be applicable not just to the British, but to all races. The Canadian author Ian Taylor has this to say in his 47 The Origin Of The Fascist Mentality"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM book In the Minds of Men , in which he considers the social effects of Darwinism: He [Galton] was now left with the claim that certain races were inherently superior and that their superiority was fixed forever from the past as well as into the future... The conclusion to Galton's argument then followed that, for the sake of mankind's future, pollution of the precious superior gene pool by interbreeding with inferior stock had to be stopped at all costs. 25 Galton proposed that legal measures needed to be taken to prevent \"inferior races polluting the superior.\" In his view, marriages needed to be legally regulated. To name his racist-evolutionist theory, Galton looked to the pagan world which had once practiced the same ideology. It was Galton who coined and first used the word \"eugenics,\" from the Greek for \"good birth.\" Inevitably, those who believed in Darwinism, also believed in eugenics. Finally, the Eugenics Education Society was established in 1907, based at the statistics department of University College, London. In 1926, the name was simplified, and it became the \"Eugenics Society.\" The Eugenics Society maintained that all handicapped people should be Francis Galton Paul Broca Charles Darwin Francis Galton, Charles Darwin's cousin, was influenced by Darwin and the French physicist Paul Broca, himself another evolutionist.

Evolutionist circles there carried out a great deal of propaganda on the subject in the 1920s and 30s, and certain states passed the laws known as \"Sterilization Laws.\" These laws allowed men and women believed to be genetically weak or sick to be sterilized. These laws are now seen in the United States as an example of the detriment of racism. What is more, the idea is now seen as a superstition, totally at variance with the scientific facts. The recent human genome project has shown that the genetic differences between races and individuals are very small, and that it is stupid to even attempt to construct any reproduction policy based on them.

In the history of science, Haeckel is known for his theory that \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" According to this evolutionary theory, Haeckel was claiming that embryonic development repeats \"evolutionary history.\" He thought that the stages of embryonic development repeated the adult stages of the ancestors of a species. In order to support his theory, which he developed under the influence of Darwin, Haeckel made a number of drawings of embryos, in which, it was later realized, he had made deliberate distortions, and that his theory was a forgery. Haeckel was a charlatan who used falsified evidence to make Darwinism scientifically acceptable. Another instance of Haeckel's erroneous science is the theory of eugenics. He adopted the theory, from such names as Charles Darwin, Francis Galton and Leonard Darwin, and took it further, by suggesting a return to the Spartan model of ancient Greece: In other words, to murdering children! In his book Wonders of Life , Haeckel proposed the \"destruction of abnormal new Ernst Haeckel"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"53 The Origin Of The Fascist Mentality born infants\" without hesitation, and claimed that it could not \"rationally be classed as murder\", beca›se these children were not yet conscious. 26 Haeckel wanted all the sick and deformed, who may be an obstacle to the so-called evolution of society, not just children, to be eliminated as a requirement of the \"laws of evolution.\" He opposed treatment for the sick, claiming that this obstructed the workings of natural selection. He complained that \"Hundreds of thousands of incurables—lunatics, lepers, people with cancer etc—are artificially kept alive in our modern communities...without the slightest profit to themselves or the general body.\" He further recommended that a commission should be set up to decide the fate of individuals. Upon the decision of the commission the \"'redemption from evil' should be accomplished by a dose of some painless and rapid poison.\" 27 This barbarism, upon which Haeckel built his theory, was to be put into practice in Nazi Germany. Shortly after coming to power, the Nazis instituted an official policy of eugenics. The mentally ill, the deformed, the blind from birth, and those with genetic diseases, were gathered up in \"sterilization centers.\" These people were regarded as parasites that spoiled the purity of the German race and its evolutionary progress. Some time after being separated from society, they were eventually killed under special orders from Hitler. It is a well known fact, pronounced by many historians who have studied the subject, that Ernst Haeckel's ideas, and the Darwinist ideology in general, were the ideological basis of Nazism. In his book The Scientific Origins of National Socialism: Social Darwinism in Ernst Haeckel and the German Monist League , the American historian Daniel Gasman presents extensive proof of this. According to Gasman, Haeckel \"became one of Germany's major idealists for racism, nationalism and imperialism.\" 28 Haeckel left Nazism an organizational and an ideological legacy. On the one hand he developed the theory of eugenics and racism, and on the other he founded the \"Monist League,\" an atheist association, and this played a major role in the effect the Nazis had on the educated section of society. Cambridge historian and London Times journalist Ben Macintyre explains the Darwinist thought that Haeckel left as his legacy to the Nazis: The German embryologist Haeckel and his Monist League told the world, and in particular, Germany, that the whole history of nations is explicable by means of natural selection: Hitler and his twisted theories"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE IDEA OF MAN AS AN \"ANIMAL,\" THE IDEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION BEHIND THE NAZI MURDERS Eugenic killings, which had been defended by Ernst Haeckel, and were put into practice by the Nazis after 1933, as well as other Nazi genocides carried out against various ethnic groups such as the Jews and the Gypsies during the war, share one common principle: the idea that people are animals. By the inspiration they drew from Darwin's theory of evolution, the Nazis considered mankind to consist of different animal groups which made up the different human races, and believed that there must necessarily be continuous conflict between them. As a result of this superstition, they felt justified the murdering innocent women and children, the sick and the elderly, in the name of \"racial purity.\""},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"55 The Origin Of The Fascist Mentality turned this pseudo-science into politics, attempting to destroy whole races in the name of racial purity and the survival of the fittest...Hitler called his book Mein Kampf , \"My Struggle,\" echoing Haeckel's translation of Darwin's phrase \"the struggle for survival.\" 29 This Darwinist influence at the root of Nazism and other fascist ideologies will be examined more closely in later sections of this book. Fascism: The Return of Paganism At the beginning of this chapter, we identified fascism as a system of violence that emerged in pagan societies. The basic reason for this violent tendency in fascism comes from the philosophy of \"worshipping strength,\" that might is right. The strong have the right to rise to the top and crush the weak. Fascists greatly admire the strong, but hate and despise the weak. The fundamental principles of this perverted philosophy are waging war, shedding blood, ruthlessness and cruelty. Against this perverted mentality that emerged in Sparta, in the arenas of the Roman Empire, and in the pagan barbarian tribes from the North of Europe, there is the beautiful morality God has revealed to us by means of religion. As revealed to man throughout history by prophets and holy books, such as the Torah, the Gospel and the Koran, what matters is not\" strength,\" but \"truth.\" Human beings must be judged by whether or not they conform to what God has revealed as the truth, not by their strength. The strong are charged with being gentle and compassionate to the weak, not crushing and oppressing them. A human being's duty is to protect the weak and be merciful and peace-loving, not to be cruel and ruthless. Modern fascism, with its roots in the 19th century, is a product of ideologies that desire to oppose those rules of morality revealed to man by religion, and to replace them with a racist, blood-thirsty and cruel culture of paganism. The neo-Pagan tendency, which began with the French Revolution, was given shape by Friedrich Nietzsche, and carried forward to Nazi ideology. Evolutionists such as Charles Darwin, Francis Galton and Ernst Haeckel strove to give so-called scientific support to this rising paganism, by denying the existence of God, and attempting to demonstrate that all of life consists of a \"struggle for survival\", thus justifying racism. The American historian, Gene Edward Veith, sums up these developments in his book Modern Fascism: Liquidating the Judeo-Christian"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"56 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM Worldview this way: \"Fascism is the modern world's nostalgia for paganism.... It is a sophisticated culture's revolt against God.\" 30 Nazism clearly revealed that fact. The Nazis defended paganism, both during the early stages, and also when they came to power in 1933. They tore German society away from Christianity, and tried to turn it to pagan beliefs. Even in the 1920s, Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazis' foremost ideologue, was already claiming that Christianity would be unable to generate sufficient spiritual energy under the Third Reich that was to be set up under Hitler's The Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg maintained that Christianity could not provide enough \"spiritual energy\" for the German Reich, that was to be established under Hitler's leadership, and thought it necessary that the German race return to their ancient pagan religion."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"57 The Origin Of The Fascist Mentality leadership, and that the German people would have to return to the old pagan religion. According to Rosenberg, when the Nazis came to power they would have to replace all the Christian symbols in churches with swastikas, copies of Mein Kampf , and swords symbolizing German invincibility. Hitler was influenced by these views of Rosenberg, although he refrained from implementing the so-called German religion because he was afraid of what society's reaction might be. 31 However, important neo-pagan practices were experimented with during the Nazi era. Not long after Hitler came to power, Christian holidays and festivals were replaced by pagan ones. \"Mother Earth\" or \"Father Sky\" were called on at wedding ceremonies. In 1935, Christian prayers in schools were stopped, and then all lessons concerning Christianity were banned. As made clear in the book The Pink Swastika, which discusses the Nazis' pagan ideologies (and homosexual tendencies), \"the revival of Hellenic paganism became a fundamental aspect of the Nazi identity.\" 32 PROPAGANDA BY MEANS OF ART The Nazis also employed art to re- awaken paganism. Ancient Greek forms, statues and symbols suddenly also became a part of German culture. Portrayals of powerful men and women, intended to represent the Aryan race, were made to resemble ancient Greek statues."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"58 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM The same book stresses the fact that there was a homosexual tendency in that pagan movement which formed the basis of Nazi identity. It also gives an interesting example of the Nazis' links to Greek pagan culture: Who were these \"intellectuals\" who popularized Nietzschean fascism in Germany?

In 1933, when Hitler came to power, he offered George a position as President of the Nazi Academy of Letters. 33 Under Nazi rule, many policies were implemented that were aimed at establishing a re-awakening of pagan culture. Schoolchildren were taught the so-called \"Glorious pre-Christian German history,\" and various rites and ceremonies, legacies of pagan culture, were held all over Germany.

There was almost no difference between Nazi rallies, held under the shadow of flaming torches, where slogans full of hate and hostility were shouted and Wagner's pagan music played, and the perverted ceremonies carried out thousands of years ago at pagan temples and altars. To re-awaken paganism, the Nazis also used the arts. Ancient Greek concepts and symbols began to predominate under Nazi rule, and many statues similar to Greek one were made portraying strong men and women of the Aryan race. Hitler dreamed that a \"superior race\" would be formed through eugenics, and a cruel and oppressive \"world kingdom\" would be established based on the Spartan model. The expression \"The Third Reich\" is a testament to this dream. (Hitler attempted to found the third and greatest German kingdom after two others which had existed previously). Because of this dream, 55 million people lost their lives in the Second World War, the They are nothing but names which you yourselves have given, you and your forefathers.

However, it is actually a pagan symbol originating from pre- Christian pagan German beliefs. The first person to use the swastika as a symbol in 20th century Germany was Jorg Lanz von Liebenfels, one of the foremost ideologues in the development of Nazi ideology, who may be regarded as the true founder of the racist theories concerning the German race. In his youth he was a Christian priest, but because of his deviant sexual tendencies, he was expelled from the Church, abandoning Christianity and turning to pagan beliefs. He founded the pagan organization Ordo Novi Templi (Order of the New Temple), and announced that they worshipped Wotan, one of the pagan gods of old German myth. (Wotan, or Odin in northern languages, was a god of war who rode an eight- legged horse and carried a spear). Von Liebenfels wanted to re- instate this aberrant belief, and announced that he had selected the swastika as the symbol of Wotan. This pagan symbol was later taken over by the Nazis, who also became devoted to the paganism of barbarian Europe, and who thought they were carrying out their massacres, conquests and killings in the name of Wotan. Adherence to pagan beliefs may also be discerned in symbols employed by Mussolini. As mentioned before, \"fascism,\" which was an invention of Mussolini's, comes from the Latin word fasces , that is, a bundle of rods tied around an axe, used in ancient Rome. Senior officials known as \"lictors\" would carry this item before them, believed to be a symbol of power and sovereignty.

T he previous chapter examined the cultural roots of fascism, how the ideology was a re-awakening of pagan ideas reinforced by Darwinism. These facts are most important for understanding the roots of the fascism and fascist movements which sprung up in the 20th century. However, we must also consider how these movements were able to come to power in so many countries in the 20th century, what methods they employed once they had done so, and the nightmare that resulted. Right after the end of the First World War, the first fascist regime of the 20th century was established in Italy by Benito Mussolini. Hitler's Germany and Franco's Spain followed.

There are numerous similarities between fascism in Europe, where the clearest examples of fascism were seen, and Latin America and Japan, where the movement also took root and flourished. Generally speaking, fascism made use of chaos and instability within a country to impose itself on its inhabitants, by presenting itself as an ideology of salvation. Once fascist governments were established, the people were kept under control by a mixture of fear, oppression, and brainwashing techniques. Social Crises: Fertile Ground for Fascism There were great similarities in the social and psychological backgrounds of those countries where fascist states came to be established. Most of the countries concerned had been defeated and heavily damaged in the First World War, and thus its people were worn-out and weary, having lost their husbands, wives, children, and loved ones in the war. As well, these countries suffered from a shattered economy, political instability, and a general feeling that the nation was in a state of collapse. People were suffering materially; the various political parties were incapable of rectifying the nations' After World War I, much of the population were either widowed or orphaned.

Essentially, the poverty Italy was faced with as a result of the First World War was the most important factor in the rise to power of Italian fascism. More than 600,000 Italians had died as a result of the war, and up to half a million people were crippled. The greater part of the population was made up of widows and orphans. The country was beleaguered by an economic recession and high unemployment. Although the Italians had suffered great losses in the war, they had achieved very few of their aims. Like many other nations exhausted by the war, the Italian people longed to recapture their honor and former glory. Actually, this was a feeling that had been gathering increasing strength since the end of the 19th century. Modern Italy looked back with nostalgia at the greatness of the Roman Empire, and felt it had a right to former Roman territory. Furthermore, there was a feeling of rivalry with the major powers of the world, and Italy hoped to raise itself to their rank, or, to rise to \"the position it deserved.\" Affected by these aspirations, the Italians hoped to become as powerful as Great Britain, France and Germany. Social, political and economic crises also played the major role in the establishment of Nazism in Germany, which had been defeated in the First World War. Unemployment and a financial crisis added to the disappointment of defeat. Inflation rose to levels that had seldom been equaled. Small children played with banknotes worth millions of marks, because money, which lost value by the hour, had come to be worth no more than pieces of paper. The Germans wanted to restore their lost honor and return to a better standard of living. It was with the promise of fulfilling such wishes that Nazism would emerge and win support. Pre-fascist Spain also demonstrated close similarities to these counties. The loss of its colonies on both sides of the American continent at the beginning of the 19th century had led to a serious diminishment of self-esteem. By the beginning of the 20th century, Spain was in a state of semi-collapse. Its economy was failing, and the privileges accorded to the aristocracy opened the way to great injustices. The Spanish looked back to the days of a great and powerful Spain with great longing. Another country where fascism came to have enormous influence was Japan. In pre-fascist Japan, the higher strata of society were very concerned about the spread of Marxist ideas among the young. But they were unable to determine how to rid themselves from that pernicious ideology.

In these conditions, the future stability of the Japanese society was regarded as in jeopardy. All of the above led to a backward-gazing nostalgia.

Because the fundamental ideas on which fascism were based (in other words, racism, romantic nationalism, chauvinism and fantasy) could only be widely accepted by the uneducated, susceptible as they were to crude, facile slogans. Such people, seeing themselves as trapped, looked for easy way out. They embraced fascist leaders, as if they were a kind of lifebelt, as Eric Hoffer says in his book The True Believer : For men to plunge headlong into an undertaking of vast change, they must be intensely discontented yet not destitute, and they must have the feeling that by the possession of some potent doctrine, infallible leader or some new technique they have access to a source of irresistible power. They must also have an extravagant conception of the prospects and potentialities of the future. Finally, they must be wholly ignorant of the difficulties involved in their vast undertaking. 34 An examination of the societal conditions that preceded fascism makes light of the fact that many people had just such a psychology.

Mussolini organized his supporters, known as \"Black Shirts,\" in a quasi-military format, and whose methods were founded on violence. They began to carry out attacks in the streets against groups they identified as their rivals. With their Roman greetings, songs, uniforms and official parades, they aroused the emotions of the uneducated and the disenfranchised.

Because the king knew what the force that opposed him was capable of, and that there was no way he could oppose them, he called on Mussolini to form a government. As a result of the developments that followed, the Italian fascists finally came to power. A while later, Mussolini banned all other political parties. Some of the opposition leaders were sent into exile abroad, and others were imprisoned. Hitler came to power by similar methods.

Hitler was arrested and lived as an exile for nine months. Nonetheless, in later years, the Nazis grew stronger by terrorizing their opponents and inciting anti-Semitic hatreds. Eventually, the Nazi Party became an important party in parliament. Throughout all this, of course, the Nazis frequently resorted to illegal methods, much like the Italian Fascist party. On January 30, 1933, Hitler was made chancellor. The post was conferred upon him by the elderly President Hindenburg, who was aware that the growing power of the national Socialist Movement was increasingly menacing, and therefore, made Hitler chancellor in order to avert a civil war. When Hitler again ran for election in March, like all fascist administrations, the Nazis employed terror, intimidation, and deception. After the elections, the German parliament immediately passed the Enabling Act, which made Hitler dictator of Germany for four years. In this manner, the administrative and law-making power came into Hitler's hands. But, shortly thereafter, the extent of his powers were increased still further. In August 1934, at the death of Hindenburg, the offices of president and chancellor were joined together, with Hitler assuming them both. Hitler followed policies much like those of Mussolini.

Those who do not agree with the ideology are intimidated into doing so. Therefore, the educational system was rendered to the complete service of the fascist state. The complete transformation of the educational system was outlined in the 20th article of the basic principles of National Socialism. Right from primary school, children were raised without any ethical values or human feeling, and in a way devoid of affection or compassion. They were educated under the principle that the strong are most right, and that it is essential to employ force to achieve one's aims. The organization created for German children between the ages of 10-18 was known as the Hitlerjugend , or Hitler Youth. All those who joined the Hitler Youth were warned that they must be highly vigilant in their daily lives, and should spy on all those opposed to the Nazis. Some of them even denounced their own parents. The Hitler Youth grew steadily, and by 1935, 60 percent of youth were enrolled in it. Another tactic used by all fascist regimes has been to conceal the true history from society, and in its place, to teach a fictitious version, written by themselves. The purpose to this has been to build a culture in which the fascists' ideals could thrive, enabling them to become both more popular and more firmly rooted in society. The understanding of history, as well as philosophy, throughout the educational process were entirely monitored by the fascist state. As they were educated by the system, people were entirely unaware that they were being brainwashed in fascist ideology, and that all other ideas were completely censored. Fascist propaganda was also aimed at young children. The above poster reads, \"Benito Mussolini loves children. And the children of Italy love the Duce. Long live the Duce!\" These and similar posters were found in all schools in Mussolini's Italy."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Idols of Fascism: The Sacred Leader The most important element of fascism is the leader, whose name is given prominence in every aspect of society. The Hitler, Mussolini and Franco regimes were clear examples of this. The titles used by these dictators, \"Der Führer,\" \"Il Duce\" or \"El Caudillo\" all signify the same thing— \"The all- knowing leader.\" And, indeed, the three ran their respective states totally according to their own desires, while their closest colleagues and most senior officers were left out of the decision- making process. Fascism ascribes an almost sacred power to the leader, in order that he can maintain his appeal and increase his acceptance among the people. The leader is the ruler of the whole country and of its people, portrayed as being part of him. A Nationalist Socialist leader, Herr Spaniol, speaking at Saarbruecken in January, 1935, said: I do not believe that the Churches will continue to exist in their present form. In the future religion will be called National Socialism. Its prophet, its pope, its Jesus Christ, will be called Adolf Hitler. 38 In a similar way, Mussolini was seen in Italy as someone with special abilities, a superior being, chosen and formed especially for the task in hand. The commandments and pronouncements issued by Mussolini were called the \"Fascist Decalogue,\" and the eighth of 87 An Analysis Of 20th Century Fascism Although fascist propaganda tried to portray him as divine and infallible, in actuality, Mussolini was psychologically ill and unbalanced.

Young Italians who became a member of Balilla swore to \"...believe in Rome the eternal... in the genius of Mussolini, in our Holy Father Fascism.\" 40 Another method employed to portray the fascist leader as sacred was the putting up of his picture and statues all over the country. This had a profound psychological effect on the public, who constantly felt themselves within the leader's power and under his control, and even, that he was always watching them. Mussolini's official propaganda service used to advise the press how, when and which of his pictures was to be printed, on which page, in what arrangement, and in what size. In these photographs, \"Il Duce\" appeared before his people in pompous poses: brandishing a sword, stressing economic development in a harvest area, addressing young fascists, as a tireless worker or sportsman.

Thus Mussolini was able to satisfy his enormous ego, not even allowing his oldest friends to sit down, but keeping them on their feet for hours. The methods employed to portray the fascist leader as superhuman, during the eras of Hitler and Mussolini, are also used by modern fascists in our own time. The fascist dictator in Iraq, Saddam Hussein , is such an example. For years, the streets of fascist Iraq have been covered with huge pictures of him. And, in them, he is shown in different roles as leader of the people: as a farmer in the country, a worker in a factory, as a soldier in the barracks.

Fascist regimes recognize this, and do their utmost to keep their people in a state of irrational emotional exuberance and agitation. They present what appear to be sacred values to the people and encourage them in self-sacrifice for the sake of the state, to despise other nations or races, and even to torture and kill. For this reason, fascist regimes have always tended to attach great importance to mass rallies, marches, meetings and ceremonies. Their aim is to form a sheep-like sense of unity in the people.

The frequent repetition of written and shouted slogans, cries, martial music and salutes are a vital part of fascist ceremonies. These fascist crowds are devoid of any kind of intelligent thought or behavior. All that remains is a group of people whipped up by slogans, songs and poems, but deaf to all reason. These masses, who identify themselves and their leaders with heroes from mythology or legends from the past, carry out their atrocities with an artificially induced sense of \"heroism.\" If the day comes when they are called to account for their actions, they say they did it for the nation, and that they are actually its heroes. Those who followed Hitler and Mussolini did so under the effects of such hypnosis, perpetrating their atrocities in this state of false excitement. Under fascism, a person's natural love for his people and country is turned into a dangerous sentimentality and a mindless loss of self-control, whereby whole societies are driven to kill by exploiting these emotions. (see Romanticism: A Weapon of Satan, Harun Yahya) Fascism's False Sacred Values Fascism is a faulted creed which sets out to do away with divine religions and to replace them with pagan beliefs. And, it is to be expected that, if false, those values which it holds as sacred must also be false.

Fascism continually prepares new atrocities and a river of bloodshed. The Imaginary Enemies of the Fascist State Fascism is a completely hollow ideology, and needs to be in a constant state of agitation in order to survive. The factor that most strengthens the fascist state in the eyes of its people is the myth of \"internal and external enemies.\" All fascist states create imaginary enemies, and declare all out war on them. The dictatorship seeks to strengthen by repeated daily media coverage of glorious victories over the enemy. And this inspires the belief that, \"in order to protect the people from these great dangers, it is necessary to be harsh and ruthless to the opposition.\" The fascist regime clings to power with the ever- prevalent idea of \"us and them,\" and of imaginary enemies of the people. A justification is thus provided for the erosion of the force of law, violations of human rights, and state terrorism.

This fictitious danger is fascism's most important propaganda weapon, by which a grievous menace is said to exist, and the fascist leader is portrayed as a \"hero\" who will save his people from it. In this illusory scenario, the artificial enemy is always brought under attack, and the fascist leader heroically repels him and defends his people. That is why the people of Iraq are still so attached to Saddam Hussein, despite all his oppression. Saddam has expertly managed to use his own ruthlessness in the media to denounce other countries as enemies. Fascist Paranoia One of the most blatant features of the fascist state is its distrust of its own people, and the way by which it attempts to eliminate everybody it has doubts about through ruthless methods, even to the extent of murder. Nearly all fascist regimes institute \"secret police\" forces to keep their own populations under control and weed out the opposition. The infamous Gestapo is a proof of the scale of the torture and savagery that the paranoia of fascist regimes leads to. In his book The True Believer, Eric Hoffer describes the policy of fear implemented by the Nazis to keep the public under control. The ran-and-file within the Nazi party were made to feel that they were continually under observation and were kept in a permanent state of uneasy conscience and fear. Fear of one's neighbors, one's friends and even one's relatives seems to be the rule within all mass movements. Now and then innocent people are deliberately accused and sacrificed in order to keep suspicion alive. 42 Fascism believes that if people are left to their own devices they will both betray the regime and become decadent. The way to bring the people to heel is by the use of repression. The French philosopher George Sorel (1847-1922), one of the ideologues of fascism, and who was a particular influence on Mussolini, heads the list of those who believed in the idea. Sorel maintained that societies naturally became decadent and disordered. In his view, this decay had to be prevented by the use of force, through the establishment of a totalitarian order.

STATE TERROR AGAINST THE PEOPLE"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Fascist Love of Violence In a report titled \"British in Africa Lack Killer Urge\" published in The New York Times of June 24, 1942, James Aldridge describes the Nazi view of war and killing in these words: The German commanders are scientists, who are continually experimenting with and improving the hard, mathematical formula of killing. They are trained as mathematicians, engineers and chemists facing complicated problems. There is no art in it, there is no imagination. War is pure physics to them. The German soldier is trained with a psychology of the daredevil track rider. He is a professional killer, with no distractions. He believes he is the toughest man on earth. 44 This model of \"professional killer\" employed by the Nazis is a common feature of fascism. Fascists regard the use of force and violence as an end in itself. The influence of Darwinism plays a major role here. The Darwinist superstitions that human beings are nothing but developed animals, and that only the strong can survive, did away with the ethical values. Love and compassion were replaced by feelings of aggression, revenge and struggle, sentiments that were presented to people as a scientific necessity. Fascists see conflict as a law of nature, and believe that peace, security and comfort impede the progress of mankind. Mussolini's words, when opening the Fascist Culture and Propaganda School in Milan in 1921, are an indication of this, where he identified action as the force that would lead fascism to victory. 45 Acts of violence, destruction, assaults and fighting are what keep fascists' morale at a high level. These are the exact opposite of peace, brotherhood, peace and tranquility. The ignorance of the fascists also plays a pivotal role in their tendency towards violence. That is why Hitler felt the need for fighters in his racist regime, not intellectuals. The Nazis' acts of violence were carried to that end by specially formed organizations. The first of these, the SA ( Sturmabteilung , or Storm Troopers) were formed in 1920, and in 1921 they took on a paramilitary quality. There were a great many street thugs in the ranks of the SA. The group was also known as the \"Brown Shirts,\" and was led by Ernst Röhm, known for his psychopathic nature (and his homosexual tendencies). The SA carried out countless acts of terrorism throughout the 1920s in order to strengthen the Nazi 106 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"An SS march-past.

SA units carried out sudden attacks on opponents of the Nazis, spilt blood in street fights, and tortured those opponents they took as \"prisoners of war.\" Hitler took pride in the violence of the SA.

The room was overcrowded and had therefore been closed by the police... The small S.A. awaited me in the vestibule. I had the doors to the large hall closed and then ordered the forty-five or forty- six men to line up... My storm troopers – for so they were called from this day on – attacked. Like wolves they flung themselves in packs of eight or ten again and again on their enemies, and little by little actually begun to thrash them out of the hall.

This corp wore black shirts. Young people were selected according to \"racial criteria\" for membership in the SS. They had to possess Aryan racial features. The Waffen-SS was the military wing of the SS. The Totenkopf , or Deaths Head, Division within the Waffen-SS was particularly renowned for its cruelty, and was brought in to man the concentration camps.

Mussolini admitted to the cruelty of fascism in one of his speeches: \"Fascism is no longer liberation but tyranny, no longer the safeguard of the nation but the defense of private interests.\" 47 It was also possible to see such examples of violence in Franco's Spain. Even at the very outset of the civil war, Franco's ruthless methods had attracted attention. For instance, in a small mountain village north of Madrid, 18 people were arrested for voting for the Popular Front. After questioning, 13 of these were taken out of the village by lorry and killed by the side of the road. When the fascists entered the small town of Loro del Rio with its population of 11,000 near Seville, they killed more than 300 people. Oppression took on a particularly violent form in the cities. To such an extent that the number of those killed is even today not known for certain. 48 Franco had hundreds of thousands of his own people killed, even including the elderly, women and children. The words of a member of the anti-Franco resistance in June 1936 describes the situation: Thousands of people have been tortured, women who refused to turn in their loved ones have been hung upside down, children have been shot, and the mothers who witnessed the torture of their children have gone mad... 49 Franco dragged Spain into a terrible civil war. Brother fought against brother, and father against son. An average of 500 people died every day. Acts of violence, slaughter, mass torture, and killings went on without end. The Spanish Civil War left some 600,000 dead in its wake. Hitler and Mussolini used Spain as a laboratory, a testing-ground for new troops and weapons. 50 The most terrible example of this was a village that Franco presented to Hitler as a gift in return for his assistance. On the morning of May 5, 1937, the people of the village of Guernica were wiped out by the huge bomber planes manufactured by Nazi technology. Franco had left the little village as an experiment for Nazi planes. 51 Fascism's Policy of Conquest Another feature without which fascism cannot survive is its policy of expansion by conquering other countries. The basis of this policy of conquest is racism, and the concept of \"the struggle for survival between the races,\" a legacy of Darwinism.

In Mussolini's words, \"Fascism... believes neither in the possibility nor the utility of perpetual peace. War alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the peoples who have courage to meet it.\" 52 Mussolini expressed his opposition to peace in another speech, saying, \"I do not believe in peace, but I find it depressing and a negation of all human virtues of man.\" 53 Mussolini inflicted great suffering, both on his own people and on those in the countries he occupied, in the name of his ideology. He occupied Ethiopia(Abyssinia) in 1935, and 15,000 innocent Muslims were killed towards his dreams of \"reviving the Roman Empire.\" He had no compunction about ordering civilians who tried to fight the occupation to be shot. He was also responsible for terrible atrocities through the use of poison gas against civilians. The most grievous example of fascism's politics of occupation is, of course, Nazi Germany.

In order to determine the reason for this, we must first define what art is. Art is found in people taking pleasure in beauty and wanting to express it. Therefore, it first of all requires a soul capable of appreciating beauty. For instance, an artist who possesses feelings such as love and affection can see beauty in an animal, a landscape, or a plant. He experiences a feeling of joy, which he then tries to depict. A composer, in the presence of such beauty produces beautiful music, because his soul, feeling that beauty, longs to express it. The same applies to every other type of art, from literature to music. However, it is impossible for those with a dark and cold soul, who are used to oppression and cruelty, and who have lost all semblance of humanity, to produce art. It is impossible for a person who believes in aggression and the superiority of force, who considers that bloodshed is necessary, who sees the world as a battleground, a kind of arena where only the strong have the right to live, to be affected by the beauties of nature or human beings, and influenced by their intricacies. Those are the characteristics of fascists, and therefore, it is impossible for a fascist to possess any artistic feeling. The fascist soul is utterly debilitated and ignorant, and lacks all understanding, and considers art \"unnecessary.\" Actually, the fascists' hostility to art goes back to ancient Sparta, that ancient city which they took as a model. At a period when art was greatly prized in Athens, Sparta saw art as unnecessary, and raised its citizens instead to become warriors from an early age. It was virtually forbidden for Spartan children to take an interest in subjects such as reading and writing or art in their education.

These were the products of a soulless and mechanical \"art to order.\" No real works of art emerged. For instance, only those subjects that the state allowed could be painted, such as war. Subjects disliked by the state were forbidden. The same applied to the written word, only those things the fascist state permitted could be written about, and nothing else. As a result, art totally unrelated to true art emerged, that, aesthetically, rendered art, architecture and literature rigid, soulless and dull. The most obvious examples of this were seen in Hitler's Germany. Because of his racist views, Hitler boycotted certain art forms. For example, because he looked on Africans as an \"inferior race,\" the playing of jazz was forbidden in Germany, for it was regarded as \"black man's music.\" In 1935, Eugen Hadamowski, the head of German radio, announced that by order of Hitler, he prohibited the playing of Negro jazz on German radio. At the beginning of the 1940s, at the height of Hitler's power, jazz began to be used as a propaganda tool in radio broadcasts directed at Great Britain and America. At that time, and in most countries, jazz was one of the most popular forms of music. Europe's greatest jazz musicians were brought together. The first thing done was to translate all the English names of the famous jazz songs into German. The lyrics of these songs were altered to conform with Nazi propaganda, and was played only on programs aimed at the West, and completely forbidden on domestic German radio. The lyrics of the songs were entirely fascist in content. Here is one example. You're the greatest... You're a German pilot... You're machine gun fire... You're a heroic submariner... You're the greatest... You're a German bomber... 54 That was the Nazis' idea of art and music.

Famous works by Mendelssohn, Mahler and Schoenberg were used as examples of unacceptable music. 55 According to Hitler, the role of art was to carry political messages in order to shape the mind of the public. What to Hitler was true art was that which portrayed life in the countryside, the healthy, and the Aryan race. In one speech, he offered his views on art and artists: We shall discover and encourage the artists who are able to impress upon the State of the German people the cultural stamp of the Germanic race... in their origin and in the picture which they present they are the expressions of the soul and the ideals of the community. 56 A 1940 wall painting by Massimo Campigli, one of the Italian artists employed by the fascist administration, at the entrance to Padua University."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Another intention of fascist art is to portray the leader as sacred.

On the other hand, however, a society which lives by true religion sees great progress and development in the arts. Since religious people know that the universe and all living things in it were created by God, they look at everything around them with the intention of recognizing their beauty. They see the art in God's creation and are in awe of it. They see people, animals, plants and everything in nature as God's creations, and both love and appreciate them, realizing their beauty and detail. In fact, the greatest works of art in history arose out of inspiration artists have found in religious subjects. Fascism's Hatred of Women There is another little known but exceedingly important aspect of fascism. It has an inimical attitude towards women, and sees them as inferior to men. This fact is recognizable in words and statements of 20th century fascist leaders. For instance, Mussolini's statement to Maurice de Valeffe, a reporter for the French publication Journal , on Nov. 12, 1922, openly belittled women: There are those who say that I intend to limit the right to vote. No! Every citizen will keep his right to vote for the Rome Parliament... Let me also admit to you that I am not thinking of extending the vote to women. There would be no point. My blood opposes all kinds of feminism when it comes to women participating in state affairs. Naturally a woman shouldn't be a slave, but if I conceded her the vote, I'd be laughed at. In our state, she must not count. 57 During the serious economic crisis beginning in 1930, Mussolini ordered that women should leave their places of work. Because he saw women as \"thieves who reach out to steal men's bread, and responsible for men's unproductiveness.\" 58 The Duce's views on women are strikingly apparent in an interview he granted the French journalist Hélène Gosset in 1932: Women must submit... Even if they have an analytical power, they have no synthetic one. Have they ever put up an architectural structure? I am not talking about a temple: a woman could do no better than erecting a hut. Women are strangers to architecture, the synthesis of all the arts: and their destiny ends at this point. 59 121 An Analysis Of 20th Century Fascism"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Through various measures, restrictions on women in the workplace were also imposed in education. For instance, a decree of Jan. 30, 1927 forbade women in high school from taking classes in literature and philosophy. A decree passed in 1928 resorted to legal measures to oppose women's education, and women were prevented from becoming directors of middle schools. Female students were required to pay double the fees in schools and universities. A decree which Mussolini put before Parliament on Nov. 28, 1933 declared, \"State bodies are empowered to impose conditions excluding women in advertisements for exams to take on new employees.. They must impose limits against a rise in the number of female workers in public offices...\" 60 According to a decree instituted by force of law on Sept. 1, 1938, women could only make up 10 percent of the workforce in public offices. In Nazi Germany the status of women as \"second class citizens\" was even more pronounced. The German Education Ministry decided that women should make up no more than 10 percent of high school graduates. In 1934, only 1,500 out of every 10,000 female high school graduates were allowed to proceed to higher education. In 1929, there were 39 National Socialist education bodies. Only two of these were for women. Laws were passed banning women from taking Latin classes in middle school: before having even finished high school, they were prevented from going on to university. 61 These decrees did not just represent a social ideology or merely imposed regulations to foster a division of labor, they were actually the implementation of the biological dogma of Nazism. Maria A. Macciocchi, author of Eléments pour une Analyse du Fascisme comments that in the eyes of the Nazis, women were a kind of animal . 62 According to such a philosophy, women were a primitive race, at a lower level in biological terms. 63 The Darwinist Roots of the Hostility to Women The root of this prejudice among fascists towards women was, as in so many other matters, Darwinism. Fascists did not merely appropriate the idea 122 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM Fascism is mired by a hatred of woman, whom it regards as inferior."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"123 An Analysis Of 20th Century Fascism of the inequality between the races from Darwinism, they also adopted the idea that men were superior to women. In The Descent of Man, Darwin wrote that women some of whose \"powers of intuition, of rapid perception, and perhaps of imitation are characteristic of the lower races, and therefore of a past and lower state of civilisation.\" 64 According to Darwin, evolution meant \"a struggle of individuals of one sex, generally males, for the possession of the other sex.\" 65 In the Descent , Darwin also wrote, \"Man is more powerful in body and mind than woman, and in the savage state he keeps her in a far more abject state of bondage than does the male of any other animal; therefore it is not surprising that he should have gained the power of selection.\" 66 Evolution was in the hands of men, and women were basically passive. As a result, women had evolved less and were more primitive, for which reason women were dominated by instinct and emotions, which was their \"greatest weakness.\" 67 Darwin maintained his views on the superiority of men and its importance for evolution throughout his life. He had this to say about this issue also by referring to his cousin Francis Galton's theories: The chief distinction in the intellectual powers of the two sexes is shewn by man's attaining to a higher eminence, in whatever he takes up, than can woman—whether requiring deep thought, reason, or imagination, or merely the use of the senses and hands. If two lists were made of the most eminent men and women in poetry, painting, sculpture, music (inclusive both of composition and performance), history, science, and philosophy, with half-a-dozen names under each subject, the two lists would not bear comparison. We may also infer, from the law of the deviation from averages, so well illustrated by Mr. Galton, in his work on Hereditary Genius, that if men are capable of a decided pre-eminence over women in many subjects, the average of mental power in man must be above that of woman. 68 Darwin's views could also be recognized in his personal outlook towards women. He described a woman's role in marriage as \"constant companion, (friend in old age) who will feel interested in one, object to be beloved and played with—better than a dog anyhow—Home, and someone to take care of house ...\" 69 It is evident that Darwin looked at women and the institution of the family from a materialistic standpoint. There was not a trace of love, respect, loyalty, affection or compassion in his outlook."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The evolutionist and materialist Carl Vogt, a contemporary of Darwin and a Geneva scholar of the mid nineteenth century, also held disparaging views regarding women. \"We may be sure that wherever we perceive an approach to the animal type the female is nearer to it than the male\" he wrote. \"Hence we should discover a greater [apelike] resemblance if we were to take a female as our standard.\" 70 Many evolutionists, following Darwin, have continued to maintain that women are inferior to men, both biologically and intellectually. Some evolutionists have even classified men and women as two distinct psychological species: males were homo frontalis , females homo parietalis . 71 One evolutionist, Elaine Morgan, noted that Darwin had motivated men into researching the reasons why women were \"manifestly inferior and irreversibly subordinant\". 72 Paul Broca (1824-1880), an evolutionist physicist and anthropologist, was particularly interested in the differences in intelligence and brain size between men and women, ascribing their inferior intelligence to the smaller size of their brains. Another follower of Darwin, the evolutionist social psychologist Gustave Le Bon, wrote; In the most intelligent races ... are a large number of women whose brains are closer in size to those of gorillas than to the most developed male brains. This inferiority is so obvious that no one can contest it for a moment; only its degree is worth discussion. ... Women ... represent the most inferior forms of human evolution and ... are closer to children and savages than to an adult, civilized man. They excel in fickleness, inconsistency, absence of thought and logic, and incapacity to reason. Without a doubt there exist some distinguished women ... but they are as exceptional as the birth of any monstrosity, as, for example, of a gorilla with two heads; consequently, we may neglect them entirely. 73 Therefore, at the basis of fascism's disparagement of and contempt for women lies the theory of Darwinism. Mussolini's taking away of women's social rights, and Hitler's building of \"breeding farms\" to reproduce the superior race and obliging young girls to sleep with SS officers, are all reflections of fascists' attitudes to women. Both Darwinists and fascists are enemies of women. They see them as an inferior and backward species, and both despise them, as well as employing discriminatory and oppressive 124 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"methods against them. This fascist perspective is completely at odds with the ethics of the Koran. God has commanded in the Koran that women should be cherished, respected, and protected. In addition, He has shown examples of women with superior morals, such as Mary and the wife of Pharaoh. In the eyes of God, superiority does not lie in race, sex or rank, but in closeness to Him and strength of belief. In a number of verses of the Koran, God has revealed that all believers will receive their reward without discrimination between men and women. Their Lord responds to them: \"I will not let the deeds of any doer among you go to waste, male or female—you are both the same in that respect...\" (Koran, 3:195) Anyone, male or female, who does right actions and is a believer, will enter the Garden. They will not be wronged by so much as the tiniest speck. (Koran, 4:124) Anyone who acts rightly, male or female, being a believer, We will give them a good life and We will recompense them according to the best of what they did. (Koran, 16:97) However, as religion was abandoned, these truths were abandoned with it, and in their place were provided superstitions such as fascism and Darwinism, in which all forms of discrimination based on sex or race are seen as justified. Fascism's Sexual Deviations The hostility to women that we have so far examined is actually the manifestation of a dark subconscious tendency. Fascism equated feelings such as love, compassion and affection with womanhood, and thus regarded it as despicable. On the other hand, tendencies such as the love of war, bloodlust and ruthlessness were seen as typically \"male,\" and for that reason \"manliness\" was elevated to the point of being sacred. When fascism's myth of \"manliness\" is examined a bit closer, however, there we find homosexuality hidden within it. This little known but important connection between fascism and homosexuality dates back as far as ancient Sparta. In earlier chapters of this book, we saw that fascism was founded on 125 An Analysis Of 20th Century Fascism"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"pagan culture, and that it emerged together with claim of re-awakening paganism. The most defining characteristic of paganism is that it lacks the moral criteria and laws revealed by God. In the pagan world, therefore, sexual deviance of all kinds was able to flourish. It was the city-states of ancient Greece that brought these to their highest point. In Athens and Sparta, homosexuality was seen as quite normal, an acceptable relationship, and even a virtue. In Sparta especially, the ancestor of fascism, a special importance was attributed to the concept of \"manliness,\" and under the name of \"love of man,\" homosexuality was widely accepted. Spartan soldiers believed that they increased their strength by having sexual relations with each other. The historian Plutarch of Chaeronea, who lived around 50-120 A.D., wrote of \"the sacred battalion\" of Thebans made up of 150 male homosexual pairs. 74 In Sparta, all healthy male children were taken into the army at the age of 12, and were immediately raped by experienced soldiers. It was believed that these perverted relations were the greatest source of strength for the Spartan army, with its \"warrior\" culture and passion for bloodshed. Such a debased and deviant culture raised its head again with the neo-pagan movement of the 19th century. And, the major center of this 126 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM The Nazis' tendencies towards homosexuality were inspired by the prevalence of it in ancient pagan societies, especially in ancient Greece. This statue by Josef Thorak, called Kameradschaft (Friendship), reflects the Nazis' idea of sexuality."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"deviancy was Germany. The leader of the movement, Adolf Brand, founded the Gemeinschaft der Eigenen (Community of the Elite) in 1902, together with Wilheml Jansen and Benedict Friedlander, both of whom were known for their deviant sexual tendencies. Friedlander published a book called Renaissance des Eros Uranios (Renaissance of Uranian Erotica) in 1904. On the cover was a picture of a naked Greek youth. Friedlander explained the aim of the book in these words: The positive goal...is the revival of Hellenic chivalry and its recognition by society. By chivalric love we mean in particular close friendships between youths and even more particularly the bonds between men of unequal ages. 75 The aim of the community was to transform Germany from a Judeo-Christian society to a Greco-Uranian one. 76 This deviant organization was also known for its racism. Referring to the ideas of the Community of the Elite, Kurt Hildebrandt, the leader of the Society for Human Rights established in 1923, wrote in his book Norm Entartung Verfall (Ideal, Degeneration, Ruin) that the superior race was that composed of homosexuals. In his view, relations with women were only necessary for \"reproductive reasons,\" but that in order to achieve an \"ultramasculine\" race, sexual \"love\" between men was essential. These ideas were none other than those of the Nazi Party, which was basically a \"homosexual club.\" This fact was set out by Scott Lively and Kevin Abrams in their book The Pink Swastika: Homosexuality in the Nazi Party, a wide-ranging study. The book examines both pre-Nazi movements and organizations, as well as the Nazi Party leadership, and reveals that there was a large number of 127 An Analysis Of 20th Century Fascism According to the documents cited in The Pink Swastika , homosexual tendencies among Nazis were very widespread."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"There were so many homosexuals in the Nazi movement that the Nazi Party has been compared to a \"homosexual club.\" Above: SS Chief Heinrich Himmler with his officers."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"homosexuals within it. It explains, with historical documentation, how the Nazis' policy of rounding up homosexuals and sending them to concentration camps was all for show, and that by doing so, senior Nazi leaders were trying to cover up their own practices. Among the known Nazi homosexuals were SA chief Ernst Röhm, Gestapo chief Reinhard Heydrich, Luftwaffe chief Herman Goering, Rudolf Hess, leader of the Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth) organization Baldur von Schirach, Nazi Germany's Finance Minister Walther Funk, and Hitler's land Forces commander Freiherr Werner von Fritsch. There is also evidence to suggest that SS chief Himmler and Hitler himself also had homosexual tendencies. 77 The Pink Swastika also demonstrates that this tendency was not restricted to Nazis in Germany, and that there are many homosexuals in neo- Nazi movements and racist organizations active in the United States, and shows that such deviance is a regular feature of fascism. Fascist pagans indulge in the sin as related in the Koran, that of the people to whom the prophet Lot was sent. However, those who engage in these practices must not forget what happened to the people of Lot. The disaster visited on them is described in the Koran in this way: And Lot, when he said to his people, \"Do you commit an obscenity not perpetrated before you by anyone in all the worlds? You come with lust to men instead of women. You are indeed a depraved people.\" The only answer of his people was to say, \"Expel them from your city! They are people who keep themselves pure!\" So We rescued him and his family—except for his wife. She was one of those who stayed behind. We rained down a rain upon them.

But alongside all of these, its really dominant characteristic is racism. When we look at the Nazi ideology, in particular, we can see that it is racism that makes fascism what it is. The Nazis set out with the dream of establishing the hegemony of the Aryan race, which they believed to be superior, over the whole world, an idea on which all their policies and social measures were based. In the words of Wilhelm Reich, \"The race theory is German fascism's theoretical axis.\" 78 Racism was also the fundamental ideology of other fascist regimes, such as those of Mussolini and Franco, even if not to the extent it was in Nazism. Mussolini suggested that the Romans who had governed the Roman Empire were a \"superior race,\" and that the Italians, as their descendants, also possessed this superior nature. The conquest of Ethiopia was based on this notion of the superior race, and that the black- skinned Ethiopians need submit to the Italians, in accordance to what was perceived as a natural racial hierarchy. Franco made similar claims for the Spanish.

We shall consider the answer to that question in this chapter. Racism and Darwinism In the earlier chapters of this book we saw that racism was a part of pagan culture, and that although it had already largely been done away with through the revelation of divine religion, it returned to Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. The greatest influence behind this new development was the replacement of the Christian belief that \"God created all people equal\" with \"Darwinism\". By suggesting that man had evolved from more primitive creatures, and that some races had evolved further than others, Darwinism provided racism with a scientific mask. In short, Darwin is the father of modern racism. His theory was taken up and commented on by such \"official\" founders of modern race theory as Arthur Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, and this racist ideology that emerged was then put into practice by the Nazis and other fascists. James Joll, who spent many years as a professor of history at universities such as Oxford, Stanford, and Harvard, explained the relationship between Darwinism and racism in his book Europe Since 1870, which is still taught as a textbook in universities: Charles Darwin, the English naturalist whose books On the Origin of Species , published in 1859, and The Descent of Man , which followed in 1871, launched controversies which affected many branches of European thought... The ideas of Darwin, and of some of his contemporaries such as the English philosopher Herbert Spencer, ...were rapidly applied to questions far removed from the immediate scientific ones... The element of Darwinism which appeared most applicable to the development of society was the belief that the excess of population over the means of support necessitated a constant struggle for survival in which it was the strongest or the 'fittest' who won. From this it was easy for some social thinkers to give a moral The official founder of racism, Houston Stewart Chamberlain."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Hitler's idea of a hierarchy and conflict between the races was inspired by Darwinism."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"135 Fascism, Racism And Darwinism content to the notion of the fittest, so that the species or races which did survive were those morally entitled to do so. The doctrine of natural selection could, therefore, very easily become associated with another train of thought developed by the French writer, Count Joseph-Arthur Gobineau, who published an Essay on the Inequality of Human Races in 1853. Gobineau insisted that the most important factor in development was race; and that those races which remained superior were those which kept their racial purity intact. Of these, according to Gobineau, it was the Aryan race which had survived best... It was... Houston Stewart Chamberlain who contributed to carrying some of these ideas a stage further... Hitler himself admired the author [Chamberlain] sufficiently to visit him on his deathbed in 1927. 80 Earlier chapters of this book described how the evolutionist German biologist Ernst Haeckel was one of the most important of Nazism's spiritual fathers. Haeckel brought Darwin's theory to Germany, and formulated it as a program ready for the Nazis. From racists such as Arthur Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Hitler adopted a politically-oriented racism, and a biological approach from Haeckel. Careful examination will reveal that these racists all derived their inspiration from Darwinism. Indeed, a deep Darwinian influence can be found among all Nazi ideologues. When we examine the Nazi theory, which was given form by Hitler and Alfred Rosenberg, we see in it concepts such as \"natural selection,\" \"selective mating,\" and \"the struggle for survival between the races,\" all repeated dozens of times in Darwin's The Origin of Species . As also mentioned earlier, the name of Hitler's book Mein Kampf was inspired by Darwin's principle that life was a constant struggle for survival, and those who emerged victorious survived. In the book, Hitler talked of the struggle between the races, and maintained that \"History would culminate in a new millennial empire of unparalleled splendor, based on a new racial hierarchy ordained by nature herself.\" 81 In the Nuremberg party rally in 1933, he proclaimed that ''higher race subjects to itself a lower race ...a right which we see in nature and which can be regarded as the sole conceivable right.\" 82 That Nazism was influenced by Darwinism is accepted by almost all historians who are expert in the period.

Whatever the deeper, profound, complexities of his psychosis, it is certain that [the concept of struggle was important because]... his book, Mein Kampf , clearly set forth a number of evolutionary ideas, particularly those emphasizing struggle, survival of the fittest and the extermination of the weak to produce a better society. 84 The Nazi Theory of Race In The Mass Psychology of Fascism Wilhelm Reich describes the Nazi theory of race thus: The race theory proceeds from the presupposition that the exclusive mating of every animal with its own species is an \"iron law\" in nature. 136 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM Nazi racial theory maintained that, in order to maintain the so-called purity of the German races, mixed marriages had to be prevented. Little girls, brought out at the Nuremberg rallies and ordered to offer Nazi salutes, were used as symbols of the Nazi idea of the \"master race.\""},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"137 Fascism, Racism And Darwinism Only exceptional circumstances, such as captivity, are capable of causing a violation of this law and of leading to racial interbreeding. When this occurs, however, nature revenges itself and uses every means at its disposal to oppose such infringements, either by making the bastard sterile or by limiting the fertility of later offspring. In every crossbreeding of two living creatures of different \"levels,\" the offspring will of necessity represent something intermediate. But nature aims at a higher breeding of life; hence bastardization is contrary to the will of nature. Natural selection also takes place in the daily struggle for survival, in which the weaker, i.e., racially inferior, perish. This is consistent with the \"will of nature,\" for every improvement and higher breeding would cease if the weak, who are in the majority, could crowd out the strong, who are in the minority. 85 As we have seen, this biological premise that forms the basis of the Nazis' race theory is \"undiluted\" Darwinism. Nonsense such as the notion that nature's aim is to \"cause superior species to evolve,\" that it uses natural selection to do so, and that the weak are inevitably eliminated, are all typically Darwinian. These evolutionist views, which have no scientific basis, and are just a reworking of the pagan absurdity of \"ascribing consciousness to nature,\" finally reached their culmination in the savagery of the Nazis. The theory was put into practice in human societies, again in a manner in conformity with Darwinism. Wilhelm Reich continues: The National Socialist went on to apply this supposed law in nature to peoples. Their line of reasoning was something as follows: Historical experience teaches that the \"intermixing of Aryan blood\" with \"inferior\" peoples always results in the degeneration of the founders of civilization. The level of the superior race is lowered, followed by physical and mental retrogression; this marks the beginning of a progressive \"decline.\" The North American continent would remain strong, Hitler states, \"as long as he [the German inhabitant] does not fall a victim to defilement of the blood,\" that is to say, as long as he does not interbreed with non-Germanic peoples. 86 When Hitler said, \"Take away the Nordic Germans and nothing remains but the dance of apes,\" he based the thought on the Darwinist ideas that man had evolved from apes, for which reason some humans still possessed \"ape \"status. 87 This logic is a consequence of seeing man as a species of animal, and"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"that there are \"superior\" and \"inferior\" races within this species of animal.

The Koran reveals this truth thus: Mankind! We created you from a male and female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you might come to know each other.

No matter by what criteria human beings are judged in this world, in God's eyes, superiority consists of closeness to Him, and fear of Him.

Everyone will have to appear before God at the Day of Reckoning, and will be called to account alone. Those attributes that he perceived as conferring superiority in this world will be of no use to him then. Quite the contrary, those who set up criteria outside those revealed by God, who claim that they are superior and oppress others, and who try to gain strength by crushing the weak, will definitely reap the fruit of their actions, both in this world and the next. In the holy verses of the Koran, this reality is revealed in the following manner: ...[S]hown by their arrogance in the land and evil plotting. But evil plotting envelops only those who do it. Do they expect anything but the pattern of previous peoples? You will not find any changing in the pattern of God. You will not find any alteration in the pattern of God.

The first was \"civilization-creating races,\" the Germans and other northern peoples. \"Civilization-following races\" were those which had no power to push civilization forward, but which were \"ordinary\" races capable of imitating it. Hitler counted nations such as the Chinese and Japanese as being in this category. The third category consisted of \"civilization-destroying races\" such as Jews, Slavs and Africans. Nazi ideology considered the intermingling of the German race with other \"inferior\" races as a \"biological mistake.\" Hitler said: \"The mixing of the higher and lower races is clearly against the intent of nature and involves the"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Hitler wanted to shape all of German society according to the Nazi ideology.

Where Aryan blood has mixed with that of lower peoples the result has been the end of the bearers of culture.\" 88 For this reason, from the moment the Nazis came to power they tried to correct this so-called \"evolutionary mistake.\" Hitler passed a number of laws to that end in 1933, and the process of cleansing between the races began. Only those with German blood were allowed to be considered as citizens, and were given preferential treatment. In June 1933, a law was brought out weeding gypsies, Africans, Jews and the handicapped out of society. Hitler defended the policy: Hybridism, with the resulting degradation of the biological level of the race, was the sole reason of the decadence of the old civilisations. For it is a fact that nations do not perish in consequence of lost wars, but in consequence of the loss of that force of resistance which has its only origin in the preservation of racial purity. For everything which is not racially pure is mere chaff. 89 Hitler believed that once the inferior races had been done away with, humanity would be grateful towards him for its development. Inspired by Darwin, Hitler described the young people of the so-called \"superior race\" he wanted to create in these words: My pedagogy is strict.

Nazi racial theory saw man as a species of animal, and considered that he could be improved by the same methods used by farmers. Therefore, the Nazis embraced the theory of \" eugenics\" and pursued its implementation. As we saw earlier in this book, eugenics is a policy that seeks the \"improvement of mankind,\" which has its roots in the ancient Greek pagan city of Sparta, and was resurrected by Charles Darwin's cousin Francis Galton in the 19th century. Ernst Haeckel described how eugenics could be carried out, and defended the killing of deformed babies from the time of birth, and that unhealthy people and the weak or mentally handicapped should be sterilized. The Nazis lost no time in implementing this inhumane policy. When they came to power in 1933 they instituted \" racial hygiene\" laws. According to these laws, the mentally handicapped and the sick were to be sterilized, and thus, prevented from reproducing. They were even to be weeded out of society, and for this reason, were gathered together in special centers. The Nazis set up these centers without delay, and threw large numbers of people into them, where they treated them like animals. The Nazi Hereditary Health Courts reviewed nearly 80,000 proposals to sterilize persons in their first two years of operation, and they approved the vast majority of these petitions. 91 In time, German eugenic policy became steadily more perverse, eventually resulting in large scale \" euthanasia\" of retarded persons, the insane, and other desirables. In other words, these people were killed.

The elderly and little children as well were subjected to this sort of savagery. As Nazi Germany unflinchingly executed such barbarity, it also pushed \"positive eugenics,\" encouraging the union of Aryan women and men to produce children who Nazi public officials believed would be endowed with superior genes. 92 With this in mind, select females with the necessary \"superior race\" traits (being blond and strong, with blue eyes) were even placed in special homes, and were impregnated by as many Nazi officers as possible.

Hitler's dream was the foundation of a German Empire that would rule the whole world, and to speed up the so-called \"evolution of man\" by sterilizing all the \"inferior\" races on earth. This in fact was a prophecy of Darwin's. In The Descent of Man , Darwin wrote \"At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace the savage races of man throughout the world. At the same time the anthropomorphous [human-like] apes ... will no doubt be exterminated.\" 96 This duty of fulfilling this prophecy fell upon Hitler. The plan was set in motion in 1939. With a series of surprise attacks, he first occupied Poland, followed by Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Holland, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, North Africa and the Soviet Union. The peoples of the occupied countries were subjected to terrible cruelty, especially those in the category of \"inferior races\" such as the Jews, Slavs and Gypsies. Millions of people were sent to camps to be used as slave labor. Soon, these camps turned into extermination camps according to the \"Final Solution\" adapted at the notorious Wannsee Conference by Hitler and his associates. The gas chambers specially designed to kill humans first used carbon monoxide and then Zyklon B. In the gas chambers and other methods of mass extermination, a total of 5.5 million Jews, 3 million Poles, almost 1 million Gypsies and hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war from various nations were brutally murdered. One of the most appalling examples of Nazi savagery were the inhumane experiments performed by the Nazi officer Josef Mengele on prisoners at the concentration camp of Auschwitz. Selected adults and children from among the prisoners were used by Mengele as \"guinea pigs\" in frightful experiments to determine the resistance of the human body to extreme hot and cold. People were forced into water full of ice on bitterly cold winter days in order to see how long they could survive before freezing. It is known that Mengele carried out surgical operations on his victims without any anesthetic, and that they were cut open wide awake. His cruelest experiments were carried out on twins who arrived at the camp. Mengele kept all twins apart from the rest of the camp and measured the effect of physical factors by performing different experiments on them. The methods he employed were incredibly barbaric. He injected twins with each others' blood and measured their reaction, and most of the time one or both of the twins suffered from violent headaches and high temperatures. 145 Fascism, Racism And Darwinism"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"MENGELE'S INNOCENT VICTIMS One of the most terrible examples of Nazi brutality were the inhumane experiments carried out at the Auschwitz concentration camp by the Nazi officer Josef Mengele.

All the victims suffered terribly, and many of them went blind. Small children were injected with various diseases to observe how long they could survive them. Many innocent children were tortured by the Nazi monster Mengele, and wound up either crippled or dead. At the root of this incredible savagery lies the Darwinist-fascist theory that regards human beings as a species of animal and some human races as \"harmful animals.\" An examination of Mengele's life reveals that he was educated in such a theory. In a study of Mengele's life and cruelties, the Social Darwinism of Dr. Ernst Rudin, the Nazi doctor's mentor, is discussed as follows: If Mengele himself became a cold-blooded monster at the height of his Nazi career, he certainly learned at the feet of some of Germany's most diabolical minds. As a student Mengele attended the lectures of Dr. Ernst Rudin, who posited not only that there were some lives not worth living, but that doctors had a responsibility to destroy such life and remove it from the general population. His prominent views gained the attention of Hitler himself, and Rudin was drafted to assist in composing the Law for the Protection of Heredity Health, which passed in 1933, the same year that the Nazis took complete control of the German government. This unapologetic Social Darwinist contributed to the Nazi decree that called for the sterilization of those demonstrating the following flaws, lest they reproduce and further contaminate the German gene pool: feeblemindedness; schizophrenia; manic depression; epilepsy; hereditary blindness; deafness; physical deformities... 97 Over and over again and at every level of Nazi brutality, Social Darwinism could be seen rearing its ugly head. The primary inspiration behind one of the foremost architects of Nazi brutality, Heinrich Himmler, were, again, none other than the Darwinist concepts of \"conflict\" and \"the struggle for survival.\" Describing the so-called \"scientific\" logic he used to justify the oppression he carried out, he said, \"the law of nature must take its course in the survival of the fittest.\" 98 148 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM Above.

More than 55 million people died, more than half of whom were civilians. Material losses were incalculable. The main factor that drove the Nazis to bring about this disaster was their claim of being the \"master race.\" And, the root of that claim was Darwin's theory of evolution. Benito Mussolini, Hitler's greatest ally, was influenced by Darwinism in much the same way. In Mussolini's view, violence was necessary for social change. He opposed all forms of pacifism and frequently used Darwinist terms in his speeches. He asserted that \"the reluctance of England to engage in war only proved the evolutionary decadence of the British Empire.\" 101 The conclusion we are forced to derive from an examination of fascist racism is clear: Darwinism is the hidden culprit behind both fascist regimes and the Second World War. Few people today perhaps are aware of the link between these catastrophic realities and Darwinism. However, it is evident that fascists have derived all their basic tenets from Darwinism. Ultimately, this ideology, which attributes the creation of life to coincidence, embodies principles such as chaos, ruthlessness, cruelty, and that might is right. And, moreover, the principle of continual conflict in Darwinism leads to a philosophy of savagery, cruelty, and bloodshed. On the contrary, God created all races equal, and as we have already seen, has revealed that superiority consists of fearing and obeying Him. Throughout history, the cruel leaders who have defied this commandment have all come to the same terrible end. As it is revealed in Sura 40, verse 56, those who \"have nothing in their breasts except for pride which they will never be able to vindicate\" have never attained their desire. God says, \"Those who do wrong will soon know by what a great reverse they will be overturned!\" in Sura 26, verse 227, and reveals that these people will meet with a humiliating defeat in this world. And, the end that awaits them in the next world will be even more terrible: God will not forgive those who disbelieve and do wrong or guide them on any path, except the path of Hell, remaining in it timelessly, for ever and ever.

It is sufficient that the religion is seen as enabling that society to bind together and to motivate people to work in the interests of fascism. When one examines the policies and practices of fascist dictators such as Hitler, Mussolini and Franco, and even such contemporary fascists as Saddam Hussein, the true face of their enmity towards religion can be clearly seen. First of all, it is impossible for fascists to genuinely defend religion, because their character and principles are the exact opposite of the ethical foundation that religion instills in people. While the religion that God has chosen for mankind is one of peace and serenity, fascism consists of war and agitation.

For this reason, they seek to give the impression that they are committed to religion, although they also try to prevent its propagation through various measures and practices. The history of the 20th century is full of such examples. The Nazis' Hatred of Religion We have already examined the roots of Nazi ideology and its attitude to religion. As is shown in the examples we have considered, the Nazi ideology was perverse and opposed to all divine religions. The foundations of this ideology rest on Nietzsche's anti-religious philosophy, and Darwin's atheist theory of evolution which denies the fact of creation. The Nazis' perspective of ethics was in imitation of the pagan culture of ancient Greece and pre-Christian barbarian German tribes: Nazism was a pagan, idolatrous ideology. This fact has been expressed by many commentators on the subject. In an article titled \"Darwinism and the Nazi Race Holocaust,\" the American researcher Jerry Bergman describes the Nazis' view of religion as such , Expunging of the Judeo-Christian doctrine of the divine origin of humans from mainline German (liberal) theology and its schools, and replacing it with Darwinism, openly contributed to the acceptance of Social Darwinism that culminated in the tragedy of the holocaust. 102 Daniel Gasman, the author of The Scientific Origins of National Socialism, agrees: [Hitler] stressed and singled out the idea of biological evolution as the most forceful weapon against traditional religion and he repeatedly condemned Christianity for its opposition to the teachings of evolution. For Hitler evolution was the hallmark of modern science and culture, and he defended its veracity as tenaciously as Haeckel. 103 Hitler once revealed his hatred of religion when he bluntly stated that religion is an: ...organized lie [that] must be smashed. The State must remain the absolute master. When I was younger, I thought it was necessary to set about [destroying religion] ...with dynamite. I've since realized there's room for a little subtlety... The final state must be... in St. Peter's Chair, a senile officiant; facing him a few sinister old women...

Why didn't we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice for the Fatherland as the highest good? 105 This was Hitler's true opinion of religion. If religion had commanded war, as with that of the Japanese, then it could be accepted in order to be used for his own ends. But Christianity taught peace, not war, and personal sacrifice instead of selfishness and rivalry. For this reason, the Nazi Party waged a continuous war against the Catholic Church. But it also tried to establish a \"Christianity appropriate to Nazism.\" SS Chief Himmler making a speech in a cathedral.

Their real aim was to use religious organizations as a tool to achieve their ends. Hitler was a particular enemy of the Catholic Church, which looked on all Christians as a supranational community. In its place, he intended to establish a church for Germans only, and by stages, to develop religion as a tool of German fascism. In a report entitled \"The Nazi Party's Program and World View,\" the Nazi ideologist Gottfried Feder wrote: Surely, some day the German people also will find a form for its perception and experience of God, a form dictated by its Nordic blood. Surely, only then will the trinity of blood , faith and state be complete. 106 According to this perspective, it is necessary for religion to be in harmony with the ideals of \"blood and state,' in other words with the Nazis' racist ideology. In Mein Kampf , Hitler summed up how religion was to be manipulated, \"Anyone who wants to win the broad masses must know the key that opens the door to their heart.\" 107 In order to appeal to various communities, Hitler used religious terms as this \"key,\" and sought to portray racism as a sacred ideal. Though he was a Darwinist, that is, one who denies creation by a divine being, when formulating his racist propaganda, Hitler made reference to creation, although distorting the idea, to use it as a justification for racism. For example, in Mein Kampf , he said: The result of all racial crossing is therefore in brief always the following: (a) Lowering of the level of higher race; (b) Physical and intellectual regression and hence the beginning of a slowly but surely progressing sickness. To bring about such a development is, then, nothing else but to sin against the will of the eternal creator. 108 Peoples who bastardise themselves or let themselves be bastardised, sin against the will of eternal Providence, and when their ruin is encompassed by a stronger enemy it is not an injustice done to them, but only the restoration of justice. 109 Nazism's distortion of religious ideas in this manner, and its use of them to serve its own racist ideology, were to some extent effective, with the opportunistic administrators of a number of German churches playing an important role in the strategy.

In 1932, the Protestant clergyman Dietrich Bonhoeffer gave a sermon in Berlin on the subject of \"the truth.\" He praised the importance of love as opposed to a racist system based on hatred.

Between 1933 and 1939, a large number of Catholic priests were arrested. Erich Klausener, the leader of German Catholic Action, was killed in the purge of 1934. Catholic publications were banned. The Nazis also attacked a number of Protestant churches. However, those among the clergy who abetted the Nazi ideology were rewarded. One of these was Dr. Hans Kerrl, Hitler's Minister for Church Affairs. In an address he gave to church leaders on February 13, 1937, Dr. Kerrl openly declared Christianity a tool of Nazi ideology, \"The party stands on the basis of Positive Christianity, and Positive Christianity is National Socialism... National Socialism is the doing of God's will.\" 111 At the end of 1937 and the beginning of 1938, Protestant clergymen, submitting to Nazi terrorism, took an oath of loyalty to Hitler, and thus sealed the surrender of the religious establishment. Hitler thereby enforced his domination over all spheres of life. Even the church was in his hands. But his real goal was to do away with all divine religions, and take Germany fully into paganism. In a secret decree dated June 1941, Nazis' aim of destroying religion was described in this way: More and more the people must be separated from the churches and their organs, the pastors... Never again must an influence on leadership of the people be yielded to the churches. This influence must be broken completely and finally. Only the Reich government, and by its direction the Party, its components, and attached units, have a right to leadership of the people. 112 The True Meaning of the Nazis' Anti-Semitism In order to understand the Nazis' religious ideas and policies, we must examine their fanatical hostility to the Jews and Judaism. The Nazis' anti-Semitism was a part of their hatred of religion. Because, according to Nazi logic, the Germans had first been a warrior-pagan society, until they had abandoned that culture with the spread of Christianity, a continuation of Judaism. The Nazis' hatred of Christianity stemmed from the fact they saw it as a \"Jewish conspiracy.\" That the Prophet Jesus, himself of Jewish origins, should be loved and respected by the Germans, whom they considered the \"master race,\" was an idea the Nazis found unacceptable. In the Nazis' opinion, it was not prophets of Jewish origin who should light the way for the German people, but the cruel and barbaric warriors of pagan German culture."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"According to the Nazi ideology, the history of the world was seen as a conflict between the \"Aryan race\" and the \"Semites.\" To the Nazis, the Aryan race was the leader of Indo-European culture, and the Semites (the Jews and Arabs) the leaders of Middle Eastern culture. The fundamental characteristic of Indo-European culture was its pagan belief system. It was for this reason that the Nazis saw themselves as the inheritors of paganism. They looked on the Jews as a hostile race who had abandoned paganism and spread monotheistic belief to the rest of the world. The Pink Swastika , which discusses the Nazis' pagan ideologies, summarizes: The reason why the Nazis first attacked the Jewish people and swore to exterminate them physically and spiritually is because the teachings of the Bible, both the Torah and the New Testament, represent the foundations on which the whole system of Christian ethics rests. 113 This errant belief of the Nazis can be discerned in many other fascist movements as well. Many neo-fascist groups today hold pagan beliefs which they consider \"the religion of the Aryan race,\" and bear a particular hatred of the revealed religions of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, which they describe as \"Semitic myth.\" Similarly, based on such deviant logic, fascist groups have emerged in the Islamic world and have tried to develop a new type of anti- Semitism in the form of \"anti-Arabism.\" However, the divine religion was not addressed solely to the Semitic races, but to everyone. Fascism, which denies the religion that God has revealed to mankind, and reveres the perverse paganism of its ancestors, is actually a great error. God mentions these errant people who turn to the \"religion of their ancestors\" in the Koran: When they are told, \"Follow what God has sent down to you,\" They say, \"We are following what we found our fathers doing.\" What, even though their fathers did not understand a thing and were not guided! (Koran, 2:170) Fascism's Hypocritical Policy on Religion Hitler's hypocritical policy towards religion was not a method restricted to Nazism, but is a general characteristic of fascist regimes.

The strategy is merely a policy designed by fascist leaders in order to unite their people under them, because they realize that people will be prepared to make all sorts of sacrifices in the name of religion, and are willing to endure a great deal for the sake of these lofty beliefs. So, they present themselves as acting in the name of God and religion. They seek to portray a religious image of themselves by exploiting the language and symbols of faith in their slogans, and propaganda. Hypocritically though, fascists carry out the great cruelties and inhumane acts which they believe to be necessary. In essence, what fascists practice and what they preach are totally opposed. The fascists' deceptive use of religion in this way and for their own power is merely another example of the extent of their malevolence. God has this to say about those who use lies against Him: Who could do greater wrong than those who invent lies against God? Such people will be arrayed before their Lord and the witnesses will say, \"Those are the ones who lied against their Lord.\" Yes indeed! God's curse is on the wrongdoers. (Koran, 11:18) On the other hand, those who are deceived by fascist slogans and influenced by their tactics are not to be perceived as sincere either. These people are rude and ignorant, with a poorly developed reasoning ability, who see religion merely as a legacy inherited from their ancestors. For this reason, they either fail to see or ignore the falsehood, depravity and lack of coherence by which the fascists employ religion. As we have seen in the previous pages, fascists have used religion to effect in people the belief that racism and a Darwinist outlook on the world are proper and correct. But, this strategy merely again reveals the fascists' lack of intelligence. Because, it is obvious that religion does not support racism, nor competition or a struggle for survival among people. God has revealed that the only superiority between people lies in godliness, which is dependant on devotion, love and co-operation between people, and not on competition.

A communist who spills blood dreaming of a proletarian revolution can later begin to exhibit the same behavior for fascist ideals. Because violence is an indispensable element of both ideologies. Mussolini spent years as an atheist communist, an enemy of religion and a fanatical Darwinist, trying to make a place for himself in Italian politics. When by these means he was not able to achieve his aims, he became a fascist. Mussolini's Communist Years Mussolini was born in a small village in 1883. His father was an avowed Marxist, an ideology he passed on to his son. According to the Oxford historian Denis Mack Smith, in his book Mussolini , \"his father used to read parts of Das Kapital to the family.\" 114 Mussolini received a communist education from his father, and was known at school as a difficult and aggressive boy, and a smart-aleck. He had almost no friends. In his 20s Mussolini became a fanatical communist, supporting anarchism, an even more radical and fanatical revolutionary ideology than communism. Denis Mack Smith writes: By 1903 he was calling himself an 'authoritarian communist'. From his father he had learnt to have little patience with sentimental, reformist socialism or with democratic and parliamentary methods; instead he preached revolution to expropriate a ruling class that would never voluntarily renounce power and possessions. Parliament should be abolished; class struggle must replace class collaboration; private property should disappear altogether. Socialists should never collaborate with bourgeois governments and never pursue a policy of strikes merely to get better wages, but should be ready to use terrorism and mob violence to effect a wholesale social revolution. 115 As we have seen, in his youth Mussolini was a fanatical communist. 165 Fascism's Hatred Of Religion"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"AGGRESSION THAT BEGAN WITH COMMUNISM AND ENDED WITH FASCISM The young Mussolini was editor of the communist weekly La Lotta di Classe (Class struggle).

Actually, Mussolini had established a relationship with Lenin during those years. According to his own later account, he met Lenin, who was in Switzerland at that time, and even won his approval. 116 Mussolini emphasized his loyalty to Marxism by saying, \"Marx was the greatest of all theorists of socialism\" and frequently quoted from Marx in his writings. 117 One of the defining characteristics of the communist Mussolini was a fanatical hatred of religion. Denis Mack Smith has this to say on the subject: From his father he had learnt to be a thoroughgoing anti-clerical. He proclaimed himself to be an atheist...He forcibly denounced those socialists who thought religion a matter for individual conscience... Christianity in particular [he said] was vitiated by preaching the senseless virtues of resignation and cowardice, whereas the new socialist morality should celebrate violence and rebellion. 118 It is important to make a careful estimation of Mussolini's state of mind as set out here. As we have seen, he revealed his hatred of and total lack of belief in God with open declaration of untruth about Him. As we shall soon see, Mussolini felt the need to support the Church the entire time he was in power, and so, sometimes portrayed himself as a religious man. Furthermore, even during the years of his fanatical communism, he tried to wear a mask of religion. While he produced fanatically anti-religious writings and speeches in his own country, he invented a story about the depth and firmness of his religious beliefs when writing for an Anglo-Saxon audience. 119 Mussolini's hatred of religion and his communist militancy lasted throughout the 1910s. In 1908, he wrote for the communist magazine La Lima under a false name, and thus clashed with the weekly Il Giornale Ligure, the publishing organ of the Catholics of Oneglia. The interesting thing is that after Mussolini came to power, the collection of La Lima in the local library disappeared mysteriously, because, after he came to power, he decided to use religion for political ends, and concealed his true face, his hatred of religion. 120"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"The Men Who Inspired Mussolini: Nietzsche and Darwin Mussolini's devotion to communism was rooted in both his tendency to violence and personal psychological problems. Denis Mack Smith describes Mussolini's personality in these words: Despite his continuing allegiance to Marx, there was little precise doctrine in his eclectic brand of socialism. He sometimes called himself a syndicalist, but in private spoke unkindly about most other socialists and to some acquaintances seemed above all an anarchist. 121 Another historian who has studied Mussolini's life, Angelica Balabanoff, thought his views were \"more the reflection of his early environment and his own rebellious egoism than the product of understanding and conviction; his hatred of oppression was not that impersonal hatred of a system shared by all revolutionaries; it sprang rather from his own sense of indignity and frustration, from a passion to assert his own ego and from a determination for personal revenge.'' 122 Actually, Mussolini's only definite beliefs were the principles of \"conflict\" and \"war.\" These he had learned from the ideological founder of fascism, in other words, from Friedrich Nietzsche, and his mentor, Charles Darwin. There is considerable evidence for the admiration Mussolini felt for them both. He admitted to his admiration for Nietzsche, whom he said filled him with a \"spiritual eroticism.\" 123 Denis Mack Smith writes: In Nietzsche he found justification for his crusade against the Christian 168 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM MUSSOLINI'S MENTORS Mussolini believed that war and conflict were indispensable to the development of a nation.

Here, too, was the splendid concept of the superman, the supreme egoist who defied both God and the masses, who despised egalitarianism and democracy, who believed in the weakest going to the wall and pushing them if they did not go fast enough. 124 Mussolini clearly referred to his ideological link with Darwinism in the pages of the communist weekly magazine La Lotta di Classe (Class Struggle), of which he was editor for a time. Pictures of Marx and Darwin were on the cover of the very first edition. The first issue of La Lotta di Classe referred to these two materialist ideologues as \"The greatest thinkers of the past century,\" and was full of praise for Darwin's theory of evolution. 125 Mussolini wrote a great deal for La Lotta di Classe on Darwinist, communist and anti-religious themes, but after 1922, in other words, after he came to power, all copies of this paper suddenly disappeared from local libraries. 126 Mussolini's False Piety Mussolini underwent a sudden personal change at the end of the 1910s. After having been a radical communist for so long, he then emerged as the leader of the ideology known as \"fascism\" as it set out on its way to power. This movement took the \"axe\" of ancient Roman paganism as its symbol. However, Mussolini did not himself discover \"fascism,\" but rather developed it from the racist trends which had been escalating in Italy during that period. But, even though he did not invent the ideology, he soon made it his own and turned it into a political movement. Just like Hitler, he gathered ignorant people around him, street thugs, adventurers, and instigators of violence. He grouped them together in a quasi-military organization known as the \"Black Shirts,\" which he employed as a weapon of terror against his rivals. By these methods, he was able to seize power a few years later. By 1922 he was Italy's prime minister. Shortly afterwards, he began to be known by the term \"Il Duce,\" or leader, and became an outright dictator. As Mussolini was emerging as the leader of fascism, he decided first to conceal his enmity towards religion, and even to appear as a devout Catholic.

In Mussolini's new view, religion was an institution that owed the state its assistance in order that it should grow stronger. Mussolini's hypocritical piety was effective, in as much as he won the support of the Church. His \"conquest of the heart of the Church\" was described in the Encyclopedia of Modern Leaders : The Church's support for the fascists began with the election of the former Cardinal of Milan as Pope. In Pius XI's view, it was Mussolini who would rescue Italy from anarchy. Relations with Mussolini, who had once waged war against the Church in articles which he signed \"A true atheist,\" and the pro-fascist Pope were always directed towards cooperation. The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano wrote in February 1923, \"Mussolini has been applauded as the man who will restore the fortunes of Italy. This is a victory for religious traditions and national civilization.\" Cardinal Vicaire called upon the public to support the fascists in the same year. The Vatican withheld its approval of the Catholic Partito Popolare's [People's Party] anti-fascist attitude and had Don Sturzo removed from his post as party leader. In return for this, Mussolini demonstrated his respect for the Church at every available opportunity, staging a religious wedding ceremony for him and his wife, whom he had married 12 years before, and having his children baptized... In February 1929, he restored the Church's rights which had been taken away in 1870 by signing the \"Lateran Pact\" in the name of the King, with Cardinal Gaspari signing in the name of the Church. Under this agreement, the Church won complete freedom of belief and worship, and Catholicism became the official religion of the state. The Vatican was officially recognized and awarded considerable benefits, the Pope was recognized as head of the state and granted such rights as compensation payments to the papacy, the recognition of Church marriages, and religious lessons in primary schools. In return for these, the Pope awarded Mussolini the order of the \"Golden Spur\" in 1932, and described him as the \"incomparable prime minister.\" 128 But, despite these theatrics, Mussolini was nevertheless an atheist.

But remember that the god of Italy is the Duce.\" 129 Mussolini belittled religious notions and re-interpreted them according to his own pagan belief system. The fact that he called the decrees and pronouncements he issued the \"Fascist Decalogue,\" reveals the scale of his arrogance and hypocrisy. However, Mussolini's arrogance did not endure long. Italy entered the Second World War on the side of Germany, but was defeated, collapsing much earlier than Germany. In 1943, Mussolini was arrested by his own countrymen and imprisoned. He was rescued with Hitler's support, and held out against the opposition in the North for some time longer. Towards the end of the war, he was once again arrested as he tried to cross the border in a German uniform, and was shot with his mistress at his side. His corpse was suspended by one foot in a square in Milan. Such was the dreadful end of a psychopath who claimed he was a \"divine being.\" How Spanish Fascism Used Religion As we have seen, fascism is an ideology fanatically opposed to religion, but which may sometimes conceal its hatred for political reasons, and even present itself as actually committed to religion. The aim behind fascists' wish to appear God-fearing is to pervert religious concepts from their true meaning, and employ them as tools for their political goals. The degree of fascism's commitment to religion fluctuates according to the nature of the society it finds itself in. Nazism felt little need to put up such a front, because it had developed itself within German society, which had already been distanced far from religion. But, in Italy, Mussolini attempted to control a far more religious society, and thus felt a greater need to play such a hypocritical role. When we consider the example of Spain, we once again see a religious society and a fascism with a religious face. The leader of this brand of fascism was Francisco Franco. Franco's ideology is known as \"Falangism.\" The term comes from the word \"Falange,\" (or the Falange Espanola Tradicionalista Y De Las Juntas De Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista, to give it its full name) which was founded in 173 Fascism's Hatred Of Religion"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"TERRORISM IN FRANCOS'S CIVIL WAR During the three-year bloody civil war waged in Spain by General Franco, hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives.

The party was established by a fascist ideologue called Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, in imitation of Italian fascism, and was opposed to democracy, the Constitution, leftist movements and the Church. In fact, the word \"Falange\" (Phalanx in Spanish) was a martial concept taken from pagan cultures. The name referred to the arrangement of a regiment of soldiers, as practiced first in ancient Sumeria, and then in ancient Greece and Rome. General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish army at the time, took over control of the Falange party in 1936, when the civil war erupted as a result of fighting between right and left in the country. However, he softened the party's anti-religious stance, in an attempt to make his brand of fascism appear compatible with religion. Franco waged a particularly bloody civil war, not hesitating even to bomb civilians when he thought it necessary. He won the three-year war in 1939, and the dictatorship he set up afterwards lasted until the 1970s. In order to maintain the regime, he pursued policies to ensure the support of the Catholic Church. At the same time, the Church was given a capitalistic role in the economic life of the country.

On the other hand, all religious movements that emerged and that were outside fascist principles were ruthlessly suppressed by the government. The book Who is Franco? What is Falangism? explains how Spanish fascism used religion in order to succeed: Fascism needs the masses in order to attain its ends... It is sufficient to use words such as religious truths and monarchy to motivate the masses... Catholics were always powerful in Spain: Most priests are outspoken supporters of fascism... So it was necessary to find and publicize a theory of Spanish fascism. This was done by Gil Robles. Robles has close connections to Spain's greatest landowners. He was educated in Catholic Jesuit schools, and began his first political activities in these same organizations... When fascism came to power in Germany, Robles rushed there at once. His aim was to learn German working methods. Robles tried to imitate German fascism in a number of areas, but he was unable to put forward the \"superior\" and \"Aryan race\" theory. So what was Robles to do? He resorted to an extreme chauvinism, which he harmonized with Catholicism. \"Spain comes before everything. God is above Spain. You are as Catholic as you feel yourself to be Spanish!\" This Catholic chauvinism of Roble's came from various characteristics of Spain itself... Robles used Catholic bodies and cooperatives and Catholic youth groups. The Catholic press also entered the service of fascism. Robles also ran the newspaper El Debate, which was well-known among conservative circles. 130 The Church also served the fascists in other ways. Spaniards in Latin America and other fascist groups set up their own versions of the Falange, so these countries could be brought under Spanish control. The Catholic Church in these countries was a primary motivating force in this scheme. 131 The story of how various fascist regimes came to power is generally very much the same. For fascists, religion is an important tool to help them achieve their ends. As a result of tactics similar to those employed in other fascist countries, the Church in Spain supported Franco. However, as we have already seen, fascists only maintain this positive attitude towards religion until they are in power, after which they generally lose no time waging war against it. The same happened in Spain. George Orwell describes the situation in revolutionary Barcelona six months after the revolution:"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Almost every church had been gutted and its images burnt. Churches here and there were being systematically demolished by gangs of workman. 132 When we examine Franco as an example of how fascists openly use religion, we find ourselves once again face to face with one of the truths mentioned earlier in this book. Fascism is an ideology that seeks to turn European societies back to the pagan religions of pre-Christian Europe. And not just in Europe. Everywhere in the world the true religion of fascists has been paganism. Every fascist movement takes its own society's pagan beliefs as a model. Their slogans, symbols and the like, all bear the features of a particular society's pagan past. Fascists try to generate an emotional fervor in their peoples by referring to their ancestors and traditions, contributing to a kind of mass hypnosis. They continually promise a return to the \"glorious days\" of the peoples' past. Essentially, they turn fascism into a religion, employing religious terms and symbols from their societies' pasts. No matter how much they may give the impression of being religious, they are nothing more than pagans. Fascist Morals Are the Opposite of Koranic Morals It is perfectly obvious that fascism has only ever led to bloodshed and suffering for mankind. The history of the 20th century is proof of this. But, despite this fact, there are still people in many parts of the world who are sympathetic to fascism. Fascist movements in our own time are spreading rapidly, under the name of neo-Nazis and hooligans. Legal measures taken against these fascist gangs are ineffective, where such powerful countries as Great Britain and Germany are unable to suppress them. This reason being that they use ineffective methods. It is impossible to restrain and bring into line people who have been brought up with no knowledge of religion, leading them to become utterly irresponsible, uncontrollable and aggressive. The only way to stop this aggression and terrorism that persists in many countries today, is to inoculate people with the morality taught by religion instead of the pagan or atheistic ideologies that are at the root of fascism. As will be clear from the content of this book, fascism opposes peace, friendship, brotherhood, compromise and tolerance. The essence of religion, however, is good morality. So fascism is an ideology completely at variance with religion. y For instance, fascism approves of racism. Fascists have always 178 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"179 Fascism's Hatred Of Religion claimed that their own race or nation are superior to others, and have used the claim as an excuse to seize their lands and property. This racist claim results in countless wars, killings, and \"ethnic cleansing.\" However, as we have seen, the Koran teaches that superiority is not subject to race, color or any other feature, but is founded in closeness to God and living by faith and proper morals. The Koran makes light of this truth: Mankind! We created you from a male and female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you might come to know each other. The noblest among you in God's sight is that one of you who best performs his duty. God is All-Knowing, All-Aware. (Koran, 49:13) In another verse, God describes racism as the \"fanatical rage of the time of ignorance\", and reveals to believers that He will protect them against this provocative ideology: Those who disbelieve filled their hearts with fanatical rage—the fanatical rage of the Time of Ignorance—and God sent down serenity to His Messenger and to the believers, and obliged them to respect the formula of heedfulness which they had most right to and were most entitled to. God has knowledge of all things. (Koran, 48:26) As the above verse makes clear, God has divided people into different races and ethnic groups so that they may interact with one another and live in peace, brotherhood and tolerance. In other words, contrary to what fascists think, different races and ethnic groups are not a tool for Social Darwinist conflict and a \"struggle for survival.\" There can be no question of biological superiority among different races and ethnic groups. God ascribes the only superiority among human beings to closeness to Him, and living according to faith and morality. In a situation where people adhere to the Koran, therefore, there will be no conflict of race, color or tribe, nor will such claims of superiority ever be able to find fertile ground in which to grow. y History reveals that \"fanatical rage\" is a sickness that originated in pagan or atheist societies, where claims based on the superiority of a race, ethnic origin or tribe, and the conflict that results from them, have always existed. These people have always sought to determine their superiority in such physical features. The Koran however says, \"All might belongs to God.\" (Koran, 10:65) Human beings are created by God with no distinction between race or skin color, but as helpless creatures utterly dependent on God.

A holy verse on the subject of the Day of Judgment reveals this fact: Then when the Trumpet is blown, no ties of kinship will exist between them on that day, nor may they question one another. (Koran, 23:101) As the verse makes clear, at the moment of death, the Day of Judgment or in the hereafter, concepts such as race, color and ethnic origin will be unimportant. The only thing of any importance then will be closeness to God and whether a person has won His mercy. On that day, nobody will be in a position to ask anyone about his race or ethnicity. Those people who are now passionate about their ethnicity, who kill others for it and even burn them alive, will understand how helpless and dependant they are, no matter what their race. y Another distinguishing feature of fascism is its tendency to violence. Fascists regard violence, the use of brute force, war and conflict as sacred concepts. That is not possible for someone who lives by the Koran. God wants the faithful to live by good morals, which he describes in the Koran. For instance, a Muslim is charged with returning good for evil. God says this in one of the holy verses on the subject: A good action and a bad action are not the same. Repel the bad with something better and, if there is enmity between you and someone else, he will be like a bosom friend. (Koran, 41:34) It is out of the question for a person who behaves in accordance with the above verse to feel any sympathy for fascist logic and methods, or to show even the slightest tendency towards fascism. y Another feature of fascist morality is that it is quite capable of sacrificing thousands of innocent people without hesitation for the sake of those aims that it perceives to be sacred. Fascists, who think that \"the end justifies the means,\" carry out all kinds of brutality for an end that is in itself utterly unjustifiable. However, the Koran says that attacking people unjustly and killing the innocent is a great crime. According to fascism, human life is worth nothing, whereas religion sees the life of even one person as being of the utmost importance. God commands: ...if someone kills another person—unless it is in retaliation for someone else or for causing corruption in the earth—it is as if he had murdered all mankind. And if anyone gives life to another person, it is as if he had given life to all mankind... (Koran, 5:32)"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Bearing in mind that killing an innocent person is like murdering all mankind, it is clear what a great sin all the killings, murders and genocide carried out by fascists has been. God reveals what awaits the cruel fascists in the hereafter: There are only grounds against those who wrong people and act as tyrants in the earth without any right to do so. Such people will have a painful punishment. (Koran, 42:42) y We also mentioned that fascists are excessively impassioned, for which reason they can easily be provoked, angered and incited to violence. Fascist groups tend to operate in the form of street gangs, become consumed with anger at even the slightest incident, and immediately resort to fighting at the slightest provocation. Naturally, this emotionally fuelled violence is completely contrary to what the Koran commands. The Koran speaks of intelligent, mild and moderate people who can restrain themselves when they become angry. Nothing that happens can make them aggressive or angry: Those who give in times of both ease and hardship, those who control their rage and pardon other people—God loves the good-doers. (Koran, 3:134) y Another tendency possessed by fascists is a group-mentality. Many poorly educated and ignorant young people in fascist groups, who do not even know why they do what they do, get carried away by a kind of hysterical emotion under the effect of crowds, slogans and martial songs. They get carried away by the herd mentality and involved in group crimes that they would never carry out of their own free will. They can attack a foreigner for no reason, or pillage a workplace. Most people who engage in such actions do so because they have become part of the \"herd,\" just one part of the psychology of the group, because their wills and consciences are weak. But God warns people against the deviance of the majority: If you obeyed most of those on earth, they would misguide you from God's Way. They follow nothing but conjecture. They are only guessing. (Koran, 6:116) For this reason, instead of going along with the majority, the faithful act intelligently and according to their better conscience. This is only possible by living in accordance with the Koran. y Another point of disparity between religion and fascism is the 182 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"183 Fascism's Hatred Of Religion Koran's requirement of peace and compromise. These concepts are the exact opposite of fascism, which promotes aggression, conquest, war, brute force and oppression. God disapproves of all of these, presented in the Koran as cruelties. On the contrary, God commands people to live according to what is good and to establish good relations between each other: There is no good in much of their secret talk, except in the case of those who enjoin charity, or what is right, or putting things right between people. If anyone does that, seeking the pleasure of God, We will give him an immense reward. (Koran, 4:114) Conclusion In conclusion, when we examine the basis of fascism, we come to see a system of ethics that is the exact opposite of those virtues that are inherent in religion, such as love, affection, compassion, humility, co-operation, and being content with what one has. However, fascism is a school of thought that systematizes the very opposite, and, under the influence of Darwinism, portrays itself as a \"scientific\" and rational approach. \"Cruelty,\" which has always been condemned by religion, is praised and sanctified systematically in fascism. This cruel and ruthless ideology has been the root of the genocidal acts carried out by Hitler, Mussolini's ruthless conquests, the bloody civil war waged by Franco, Pinochet's brutalities, Saddam Hussein's killing of 5,000 civilians by nerve gas, the inhumane savagery meted out to the Bosnians and Albanians by Milosevic, and many other current atrocities. The fascist ideology plays a role, not only in state-sponsored violence, such as mentioned above, but also in every-day instances. The stabbing, beating or killing of people because of a simple misunderstanding are the product of a culture that sees and portrays violence as a kind of heroism. The source this mentality is the influence of the idea of a \"struggle for survival,\" once professed by such ideologues as Darwin and Nietzsche. The cause of this sickness is the lack of religion in these people. They may perhaps claim to be religious if asked, but they have not the slightest inkling of the true beauty and nobility that religion bestows on people. And for the same reason, the cure for this sickness is for people to learn the true meaning of, as well as understand and live by, Koranic morality."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"T he defining characteristic of fascist leaders is their tendency to construct regimes founded on fear and oppression. They tend to intimidate their citizenry through threats, repression and torture, and thus control them as they wish. This is the case in almost all fascist regimes. Those who go along with them are those who generally support might instead of right, easily bow their heads in the face of brutality, and are the kind of weak souls that can easily be led in any direction the authorities want. Ignorance here plays an important role. In the Koran, God provides an example of a cruel dictator and the kind of society those loyal to him consist of: Egypt in the time of the Pharaohs. The Pharaoh who ruled Egypt at the time of the prophet Moses established a system based entirely on the use of oppression. He did not hesitate using force and brutality, as all fascist leaders have done in order to fortify their authority. When we examine what the Koran has to say about Pharaoh, we see a striking resemblance to modern fascist leaders. Like fascist leaders in our own time, Pharaoh divided the people in his country into classes, massacring some of them: P P H H A A R R A A O O H H : : A A F F A A S S C C I I S S T T P P H H A A R R A A O O H H : : A A F F A A S S C C I I S S T T C C H H A A R R A A C C T T E E R R R R E E L L A A T T E E D D C C H H A A R R A A C C T T E E R R R R E E L L A A T T E E D D I I N N T T H H E E K K O O R R A A N N I I N N T T H H E E K K O O R R A A N N"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"RAMESES II: THE FASCIST PHARAOH OF ANCIENT EGYPT Rameses II, who ruled Egypt in the time of the prophet Moses, governed a regime founded on oppression and violence, enslaving minorities in his country (the Israelites), and portraying himself as a divine being: Just as modern fascists have done."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"We recite to you with truth some news of Moses and Pharaoh for people who believe. Pharaoh exalted himself arrogantly in the land and divided its people into camps, oppressing one group of them by slaughtering their sons and letting their women live. He was one of the corrupters. (Koran, 28:3-4) Another striking feature of Pharaoh's regime is the use of military power against his own people, in the very same way as the modern fascists. For instance, he sent his army to prevent the flight of the children of Israel and the Prophet Moses. The Koran repeatedly uses the expression \"Pharaoh and his troops\" when speaking about his government, which indicates that it was a militarist one. Another similarity between Pharaoh and contemporary fascists is the way they portray themselves as divine. The \"deification of the leader\" employed in Hitler and Mussolini's regimes was also openly employed by Pharaoh: Pharaoh said, \"Council, I do not know of any other god for you apart from Me...\" (Koran, 28:38) Pharaoh called to his people, saying, \"My people, does the kingdom of Egypt not belong to me? Do not all these rivers flow under my control? Do you not then see?\" (Koran, 43:51) The verse also indicates that Pharaoh gave virulent speeches and hectored his people, a most distinctive feature of the propaganda methods employed by fascist dictators such as Hitler and Mussolini. At a time when Pharaoh was pressuring his people to follow wherever he led them, a true prophet, the Prophet Moses, came to tell the people of Egypt the truth and lead them onto the correct path. But they were afraid to follow Moses, and stuck with Pharaoh, who appeared to them more powerful: No one believed in Moses except for a few of his people out of fear that Pharaoh, and the elders, would persecute them. Pharaoh was high and mighty in the land. He was one of the profligate. (Koran, 10:83) As we have seen, some of those who might have believed in the Prophet Moses failed to do so out of fear of incurring the wrath of Pharaoh and those around him. This shows that Pharaoh's regime was one that oppressed people solely because of their beliefs, a fundamental characteristic of fascism. Another similarity between Pharaoh and contemporary fascist leaders is their discriminatory and racist treatment of people. The racist views of modern 187 Pharaoh: A Fascist Character Related In The Koran"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"fascists can also be seen in Pharaoh. Like the \"anti-Semitic\" leaders of our own time, Pharaoh also saw the people of Israel as a so-called inferior race, and belittled the prophets Moses and Aaron before their own people, the People of Israel. Here is an example of the words of Pharaoh and those around him: They said, \"What! Should we believe in two human beings like ourselves when their people are our slaves?\" (Koran, 23:47) As is clear from the examples given so far, there were important resemblances between Pharaoh's system and that of fascist regimes in our own time. These similarities are not just limited to administrative systems, but also apply to the peoples administered under those systems. Certainly, most people who abided by Pharaoh and followed his rule knew that they were doing the wrong thing, and that the Prophet Moses was in the right. But, because they saw Pharaoh as powerful, and as their ruler, they thought that they had no other alternative. They fell under the influence of brute force and power. They believed in the principle that \"might is right,\" though the only true possessor of might and dominion is God. Because they could not comprehend this, they and Pharaoh ultimately suffered great humiliation, both in this world and in the hereafter. The Koran describes the end that awaited these people: So We seized him and his troops and flung them into the sea. See the final fate of the wrongdoers! We made them leaders, summoning to the Fire, and on the Day of Rising they will not be helped. We pursued them with a curse in this world and on the Day of Rising they will be hideous and spurned. (Koran, 28:40-42) The end met by fascist leaders is just as unhappy as that of Pharaoh. Hitler committed suicide, and Mussolini was condemned to death by his own people. The cruelties they committed in an attempt to elevate themselves only led to their humiliation. They became people who were remembered with disgust by those who came after. Furthermore, their humiliation in the hereafter will be much greater than that in this world. But it must be remembered that the suffering in the hereafter is not just restricted to them, it also includes their followers. This truth is again revealed in the Koran: They will all parade before God and the weak will say to those who were arrogant, \"We followed you, so can you help us at all against the punishment of God?' They will say, \"If God had guided us, we would have guided you. It makes no difference whether we cannot stand it or bear it patiently.

Fascism, rising during the first half of the 20th century, collapsed before it could see the second half. However, the collapse of fascism did not mean that as a problem it had been wiped off the face of the earth. After the Second World War, and in the Third World, fascism actually increased. The dictators and juntas which came to power in Latin America and Africa, were also basically committed to fascism. The Savagery of Fascism in Latin America Third World fascists did not hesitate to commit atrocities recalling the Nazi massacres. For instance, the Chilean dictator General Pinochet, who came to power with a military coup against President Allende in 1973, turned his country into a river of blood.

Following that, a ruthless policy to eliminate Allende's supporters and the opposition was implemented. The junta killed thousands of people in its first year in power, and approximately 90,000 Chileans out of a population of 9 million were arrested. The terrorizing of the population, corpses piled up in morgues, or shot and thrown into the Mapocho River, the detention of suspects in the Santiago Stadium, hostage-takings, frequent search operations and lootings, were just a few of the crimes of the Pinochet regime. Academic institutions were \"cleansed,\" and history and geography courses in universities were subjected to censorship by the fascist authorities. Fascist dictatorships similar to that of Pinochet came to power in Latin American countries such as Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and Paraguay, and also carried out appalling cruelties. Thousands of opponents of the junta in Argentina \"disappeared.\" According to the evidence that emerged after the fact, more than 2,000 political detainees were put onto planes and thrown out over the sea from thousands of feet in the air. A former gendarme, Federico Talavera, who appeared on Argentine television on April 27, 1995, admitted the tortures carried out during the time, saying among other things that pregnant women were thrown into the sea and that dogs were specially trained to bite peoples' sexual organs.

The brutality in Guatemala was also horrifying. In the 1960s and 1970s, the fascist regime which overthrew the country's first and only elected president, Jacobo Arbenz, in 1954, turned the country into killing-fields. Among the fascists' targets, in conformity with fascism's general hatred of religion, were men of religion. Amnesty International announced that between October 1966 and March 1968, some 8,000 Guatemalans, including many priests, were killed by \"death squads.\" In 1972, the number of death squad victims went up to 12,000, and to 20,000 four years later. The Roman Catholic Bishops Conference described the government's policy as \"genocide.\" In Killing Hope: US Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II, the American writer William Blum explained the torture methods used by the Guatemala regime: Anyone attempting to organize a union or other undertaking to improve the lot of the peasants, or simply suspected of being in support of the guerrillas, was subject ... unknown armed men broke into their homes and dragged them away to unknown places ... their tortured or mutilated or burned bodies found buried in a mass grave, or floating in plastic bags in a lake or river, or lying beside the road, hands tied behind the back ... bodies dropped into the Pacific from airplanes. In the Gual area, it was said, no one fished any more; too many corpses were caught in the nets ... decapitated corpses, or castrated, or pins stuck in the eyes ... a village rounded up, suspected of supplying the guerrillas with men or food or information, all adult males taken away in front of their families, never to be seen again ... or everyone massacred, the village bulldozed over to cover the traces ... seldom were the victims actual members of a guerrilla band. One method of torture consisted of putting a hood filled with insecticide over the head of the victim; there was also electric shock — to the genital area is the most effective. 133 William Blum quotes a statement by a female native Guatemalan.

William Blum speaks of victims \"having their eyes put out, their testicles cut off and stuffed in their mouths, and their hands and feet cut off\" by the security forces, as well as women \"having their breasts cut off.\" Similar fascist regimes held power in African countries, such as Zaire, Uganda and South Africa, for long periods of time. The regime of South Africa adopted a fiercely racist ideology, reminiscent of Nazi Germany. The black majority in South Africa, the original inhabitants of the land, were exploited by the white minority for years. In short, the second half of the 20th century was as much the brunt of fascist violence as the first.

However, fascism may rear its head at any time, in various places and under different conditions. The Middle East in particular has suffered from the violence of fascist regimes and organizations. One such fascist dictator is at this very moment threatening the region: Saddam Hussein. It will be useful to examine Saddam Hussein's past in order to better recognize his fascist character. The events that brought him to power in Iraq began with a military coup. In February 1963, a group of officers and street militants, calling themselves the Baath (Resurgence) Party, overthrew General Kassem who was then in power. Among these militants was one young member of the six-man team charged with killing Kassem: Saddam Hussein al-Takriti, or Saddam Hussein from Takrit. Although he was not a soldier, Saddam usually wore a military uniform, and after the coup, he was brought in by the Baath administration to head a group responsible for terrorism and murder. The first thing he did was to develop new and effective methods of torture with which to interrogate opponents of the coup. When the administration that followed the Baath's palace coup collapsed, in November of that same year, Saddam's torture facility was exposed, which was equipped with various implements of torture that Saddam had invented himself. The Baath government lasted less than ten months, and was brought down by another coup. But the party carried out a second coup on July 17, 1968. This time the plotters remained in power. The leader of this second Baath coup was \"torture expert\" Saddam Hussein. He brought in his personal relatives into key positions in the regime, and eventually gathered complete power by eliminating his rivals. The merciless torturer had become the dictator of Iraq. After coming to power, Saddam pursued war and conflict constantly. In 1988 he engaged in a surprise and totally unjustified attack on Iran, occupying part of the country. The war lasted for eight years and cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Iranians. Two years after the war had ended, he invaded Kuwait, again without justification, leading to the Gulf War. Like Hitler, who carried out savage attacks for four years to enlarge German territory, Saddam terrorized those around him. Furthermore, he had no qualms about using the most oppressive methods 196 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"against his own people. Throughout his rule, those regarded as opponents of the regime, and various political and ethnic groups, have suffered all kinds of repression. An edition of Newsweek described Saddam's fascistic character in the following manner: His detractors call him a bloodthirsty tyrant—the Butcher of Baghdad. Saddam Hussein rules Iraq with an iron hand inside a steel glove, backed by a million-man Army and a legion of informers, assasins and torturer s. Saddam, as he is known throughout the Middle East, is utterly ruthless in the pursuit of glory for himself and his country. He has not hesitated to use poison gas on enemies both foreign and domestic. 135 Saddam has spilt the blood of numberless Iraqis. At the end of the war against Iran, 1 million out of Iraq's population of 17 million had either been killed or injured. More than 1 million people left the country for political and economic reasons. The human rights organization Middle East Watch states that many people were relocated or deported, arrested and punished for no reason, and that the use of torture was widespread, together with political executions and unsolved killings in Iraq. According to Amnesty International, torture, even of children, includes such methods as r oasting victims over flames, amputating noses, limbs, breasts and sexual organs, and hammering nails into bodies. 136 The atrocities carried out by Saddam at Halabja in 1988 demonstrate his fascistic treatment of people of different ethnic origins. Nerve gas was used against the Kurdish settlers, causing the death of many innocent men and women, including babies and the elderly. 197 Third World Fascists"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Saddam Hussein attacked the village of Halabja in northern Iraq with chemical weapons in 1988, because it would not submit to his authority.

A doctor who fled from Iraq described: \"I was an intern in a hospital in the South. Only doctors were allowed to see the people brought from prison. Most of them were no more than lumps of meat, and most of them died. No political detainee lived through the torture. I fled when I realised that I was about to be detained.\" 138 Even Saddam's own family and closest associates were victims of his cruelty. His step-brother Barzan Takriti fled to the United Arab Emirates out of fear that Saddam and his son Uday were going to kill him. Two of Saddam's son-in-laws, Hussein and Saddam Kamel fled to Jordan out of fear of him. Saddam then guaranteed them that their lives would not be in danger, but as soon as the brothers returned to Baghdad, they and their father were killed. Later, their mother's body was found cut to pieces, all which happened before the eyes of the world. The Iraqi leader also uses cruel methods as well to intimidate opponents who have fled the country. For instance, General Najib Salihi, who escaped to Jordan in 1995, reported that his close family were raped and that tapes of the act were sent to him. He also said that the same has been done to many other opponents of the regime. As we can see from these numerous examples, Saddam's authority in Iraq is entirely based on intimidation, terror and torture, while the people within his fascist regime are hungry, unemployed and living in poverty. Little children are dying of hunger and lack of medicine, while the rest of the nation is doomed for either death or extinction. Despite all of this, the people will say nothing against Saddam, whether out of fear or from the effects of mass- hypnosis, but instead blame \"them,\" Saddam's enemies, for the poverty they are suffering. In Saddam, we can also discern several other fascist characteristics. Of these is the way he compares himself to pagan dictators of the past, just as the Nazis and other fascists had done . The \"Sparta\" that Saddam selected was Babylon, a pagan empire of the ancient Middle East. He sees and portrays 200 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM Saddam compares himself to Nebuchadnezar, the pagan ruler from ancient Babylon. (Above. A coin Saddam had minted to that end.)

Nebuchadnezzar, who destroyed the temple of Solomon and carried the People of Israel to captivity in Babylon, is known to history for two characteristics, that of a ruthless commander, and a great architect. He was also filled with a pride bordering on the psychopathic. He had his name written on every one of the bricks used in the construction of the buildings he had erected. In direct imitation, and despite all the poverty and misery he inflicts on his people, Saddam has his name written on the bricks used to build the palaces he constructs so ostentatiously. A great portion of the Iraqi people, however, have been so psychologically deformed by Saddam's fascism, that they do not see the construction of such palaces as a wrong or as an injustice to them. On the contrary, they regard these palaces, where Saddam lives in great luxury, as a matter of national honor, and something Iraq can display proudly to foreigners. Another example of Saddam's fascist character is that, although he has no religious belief, he sometimes puts on a false facade of religion to use religion for his own political ends. However, it is clear that the use of religious symbols for improper ends (such as to keep Saddam in power and spreading evil) is tremendous hypocrisy. The duty of the Iraqi people, and indeed of everyone, when faced with fascism, is not to be deceived by its propaganda methods, but to distinguish between the truly devout and the fascists who just pretend to be so, and to then act accordingly. It is not difficult to make out the difference between the two, because a fascist can never be truly devout. In the Koran, God has this to say about these two-faced leaders who, through their power and ill-earned respect, deceive their people into complacency: Among the people there is someone whose words about the life of the world excite your admiration, and he calls God to witness what is in his heart, while he is in fact the most hostile of adversaries. Whenever he holds the upper hand, he goes about the earth corrupting it, destroying crops and animals. God does not love corruption. When he is told to have fear of God, he is seized by pride which drives him to wrongdoing. Hell will be enough for him! What an evil resting-place!

It is true that the foremost representatives of fascism have been removed from power, but the foundations of their ideology (Darwinism, the love of violence and racism) still survive. For that reason, the death of Hitler or Mussolini did not mean the death of fascism. On the contrary, the widespread belief that \"fascism had ceased to exist\" only prepared the ground for the development of new fascist groups. Fascism survived, sometimes under its original name, other times by disguising itself. In fact, it enjoyed a particular rise in prominence during the 1990s. This chapter will examine this new upsurge of fascism and the threat it poses to the world. We shall first see how racism is alive and well in Europe, and then consider the proliferation of neo-Nazi organizations. Finally, we shall identify the ideology behind this phenomenon, the hidden face behind the growing trends in racism.

The number of such incidents in Great Britain was 10,982 between April and September alone. Half of these crimes consisted of threats or intimidation. Many of them, however, ended in death, injury, burning or destruction of property. Those responsible were fascist gangs known as neo- Nazis. The neo-Nazi movement became effectively organized in the 1990s. Before that, there were the skinheads of Britain in the 1970s. The defining characteristic of the skinhead movement were attacks on people in impoverished areas inhabited by refugees and foreigners. Only some of these incidents were racist. But in the 1990s, most of the skinheads took to racism and began carrying out racist and fascist attacks as supporters of Nazism. At present, the neo-Nazi movement is growing stronger and spreading. They are active today in 33 countries and on six continents. They number some 70,000. The members of these street gangs are generally aged between 13 and 25 and use the Internet to communicate. Neo-Nazis have different targets in different countries. According to one piece of research, they organize against the Turks in Germany, against the gypsies in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, against the Asians in Britain, North Africans in France, people from the Northeast in Brazil, and against all minorities and refugees in America. In some countries, the unemployed and those living in poor areas can be chosen as targets. These Nazi-imitating young people are mainly drug addicts, and unemployed street ruffians. They can be easily recognized by the Nazi symbols on their clothes, their shaven heads, and their tattoos, generally referring to their hatred of other races. In their slogans, language, and songs, they praise Hitler and vow to make his dreams come true: A world ruled by the Aryan race. The kind of people who join these gangs are young, from dysfunctional families, badly educated, unsupervised, and with little self-confidence. By despising others, using violence and fear, they help deceive themselves into believing that they belong to a group that is superior to others. Among their characteristics, we can list hatred, intimidation, threatening behavior, destructiveness, and harmfulness. The greatest perpetrators of these are regarded among them as heroes. Neo-Nazis also have their own particular style of music. These circles regard music as a propaganda tool. The lyrics of their songs reveal their racist, paranoid and aggressive attitudes. The names of their songs and groups also carry the same message: with names such as \"Vampire,\" \"White Noise,\" \"Battleground,\" \"Razor Edge,\" and \"White Warriors.\" 204 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Since the 1990s, racist attacks by groups known as Skinheads have been increasing.

Skinheads and various other hooligans have attended sporting events and shouted chants against players of other ethic groups or nationalities, even attacked opposing fans, and initiated fist- fights in the stands, that at times have ended in death. These gangs, even though they are not actually neo-Nazis, can also easily be aroused for neo-Nazi actions. By neo-Nazi organizers, they are seen as people who can be easily manipulated, because they also enjoy neo-Nazi music, and therefore, under the right mix of Nazi propaganda, can be rallied and called to action at any time. It is in this way that racist movements continue to poison the younger generation and win new adherents. The reason why neo-Nazi movements in Europe have been able to become so powerful is the secret support they enjoy from the rest of society and from politicians. Many parties active in Europe today and under various names actually exercise fascist tendencies and actively support the neo-Nazis. Beyond this politicization, neo-Nazis think that they can achieve their ends by violence and street actions. 206 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"FASCISM BY WAY OF MUSIC The neo-Nazi movement is developing as a subculture that is beginning to have an increasing influence on ignorant and problematic segments of the population.

They believe instead in the law of the jungle, and that right belongs to the strong, not to the conscientious. In their opinion, aggression and oppression are the greatest factors. Racist Threat in Modern Europe The neo-Nazis are representatives of a broader radical racist movement in Europe. They are the \"sharp edge\" of the fascist axe, to coin a phrase. But this axe also has its roots, and these represent a wider social and political constituency than the neo-Nazis themselves. The racism of the neo-Nazis is a reflection of growing racist tendencies in Europe. Most interestingly, racism is still an insidious problem in the Europe culture, which places great importance on democracy and human rights. According to research carried out in 1997, racists comprise some 33 percent of Europe's general population. This figure is higher in Belgium, France and Austria. 55 percent of Belgians describe themselves as \"quite\" or \"very racist,\" and the figures are 48 percent in France and 42 percent in Austria. In Germany the number of racists is about 34 percent. So when neo-Nazis throw Molotov cocktails and chant \"Foreigners out!\" they are actually carrying out the thoughts of 35 percent of the population. 140 The \"Pasqua law\" of 1993, named after French interior minister Charles Pasqua, greatly alarmed foreigners living in France with the extended powers of search it granted to the police. Even the houses of French citizens of foreign origin were subjected to dawn raids and their inhabitants taken into custody, including men, women and children. These foreigners were treated like war criminals: questioned for days, and some had their arms or legs broken under torture . 141 The 17-year-old Zairois Nikomé was shot in a Paris police station having been detained on suspicion of theft. A protest march was held the next day (April 7, 1993), and two Blacks who took part were beaten and killed by the French police. Those workers and students in France legally, and with residence permits, began to live in even greater fear and distress, when it came to light that a French citizen of Moroccan origin was tortured and left for dead by three French police officers. 209 The Silent Rise Of Fascism"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"RUSSIA SERBIA ITALY ENGLAND Racist Neo-Nazi movements are spreading to many countries.

TRACES OF RACISM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Such events show that racism is still an important threat in Europe. Ilya Ehrenburg, the author of the book Europe After Fascism , sets out the current form of racism that still persists in Europe: Above everything fascism means national hatred, the opposite of national pride. People infected with fascism have no concept of feeling pride in other peoples' cultures, and only feel pride in their own roots... 142 This national hatred is a deviant moral tendency described by God as \"fanatical rage of the time of ignorance\" (Koran, 48:26) God reveals in the Koran that this \"fanatical rage\" is a characteristic of paganism , one that Islam is protected from. This makes evident to us once again that fascist racism is born of the abandonment of religion, and its replacement with paganism. It appears that the increasing prevalence of racist tendencies in Europe must be related to neo-Nazi movements, who are gaining further ground every day, as well as to paganism. And so it is. \"White Supremacy\" and the New Fascist Ideology When the words \"fascist organizations\" are mentioned in our time, most people first think of the German neo-Nazis. But there are in actuality many more such organizations. There are several active groups in the United States which are given more \"theoretical\" weight than the German neo- Nazis. These groups generally go by the slogan of \"White Supremacy.\" And, most important of all, theirs is not a \"hatred of foreigners\" resulting from economic difficulties, but is put forward rather as a philosophical and scientific doctrine. Various fascist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi Party, the Aryan Nation movement, and the National Alliance all come under the umbrella of \"White Supremacy.\" The aim of these groups, who disseminate extensive propaganda over the Internet, is to defend racism as a doctrine and worldview, and to facilitate its spread. The basis of such a doctrine is clearly set out in the manifesto of one of these groups, the National Alliance. The truly interesting thing is that this manifesto is a corroboration of what we have investigated throughout this book, that fascism is fundamentally a pagan and Darwinist ideology. 211 The Silent Rise Of Fascism"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The fascist National Alliance stresses the difference between themselves and \"Semitic beliefs\" (Islam, Christianity and Judaism), and states that they believe only in nature, that they are evolutionists, whereas \"Semitic beliefs\" are based on faith in God: We see ourselves as integral with a unitary world around us, which evolves according to natural law. In the simplest words: There is only one reality, which we call Nature... We are a part of Nature and subject to Nature's laws. Within the scope of these laws we are able to determine our own destiny... In other words, we ourselves are responsible for everything over which we have the power of choice: in particular, for the state of our environment and for the destiny of our race. This view may be contrasted with the Semitic view... They believe that it is not necessary for men to concern themselves with the future, beyond planning for their own needs, because their god has everything under control. 143 Religion is clearly opposed to fascism. The latter considers man to be \"a product of nature,\" whereas religion teaches that man was created by God, and that God determines his destiny. In the fascist National Alliance manifesto, the evolutionist logic behind its racist ideology is described in the following terms: Our world is hierarchical. Each of us is a member of the Aryan (or European) race, which, like the other races, developed its special characteristics over many thousands of years during which natural selection not only adapted it to its environment but also advanced it along its evolutionary path. Those races which evolved in the more demanding environment of the North, where surviving a winter required planning and self-discipline, advanced more rapidly in the development of the higher mental faculties... 144 In other words, it is claimed that the Aryan race is superior to others because it has \"evolved further.\" The National Alliance goes even further, claiming that racism is a \"duty to nature,\" and bases this assertion on an appeal to Nietzsche's philosophy: First, we have an obligation to the Nature of which we are a part to participate as effectively as we can in its eternal quest for higher levels of development, higher forms of life.

The cover of the organization's fascist National Vanguard magazine is decorated with statues of ancient Greek gods. Its articles frequently quote from the works of Darwin, and presents, based on Darwin's evolutionary national selection mechanism, such claims as, \"a race eternally at war with the rest of the world has a distinct survival advantage over those races with an attitude of live and let live.\" 146 One can find similar statements, and Darwinist opinions, as well as propaganda defending the errant culture of paganism against the divine religions, in the publications and web sites of other fascist organizations. Fascistic racism, whose birth coincided with the re-awakening of paganism and the theory of evolution in the 19th century, continues to grow in the 21st century, based on these same fundamental delusions. 214 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Fascism in Daily Life As we have seen, racism, one of the fundamental characteristics of fascism, is on the rise in Europe, and behind it lies the spread of the Darwinist-paganism. But has pagan morality, which justifies the love of violence, bloodshed and mercilessness, other core fundamentals of fascism, also survived? Yes, it is alive, and thriving. In his book, titled Modern Fascism: Liquidating the Judeo-Christian Worldview , the American historian Gene Edward Veith explains how fascist culture is still alive and kicking: In the 1930s, avant-garde artists shocked the bourgeoisie with their aesthetic theories that glorified violence and the release of primitive emotions. Today, if you like examples of early fascist aesthetics, simply go to the latest Hollywood blockbuster, turn on MTV, or go to a Heavy Metal concert. Here you will see realized the fascists' artistic ideals: pleasure from violence; the thrill of moral rebellion; the cult of the Aryan body. The grisly blood-letting of a slasher movie; the body- builder who takes the law into his own hands by machine-gunning his enemies; the masses of teenagers slam-dancing as Metallica sings 'Scream, as I'm killing you!' —such art is the quintessence of the fascist aesthetic. 147 There is a fascistic influence hidden in the \"popular culture\" of our daily lives. This culture, with its passion for violence which we see in films, cartoons, rock concerts and music clips, is the result of the Darwinist-fascist ideology. This point of view, which regards man as a species of animal, and maintains that the only law of nature consists of \"killing, fighting and destruction,\" all which it portrays as justified, intelligent and scientific, is inciting people in our own time towards acts of violence and an aggressive, crude, savage and bloodthirsty attitude, just as it had incited people to Nazi barbarity in 1930s Germany. It is sufficient to consider the media to recognize the place of fascism in our daily lives. Family members stabbing each other over trivial matters, fanatical fans beating each other to death after a football match, children wickedly killing their father to lay their hands on an inheritance, psychopaths who kidnap a small child and torture him or her to death, only to say that they did it \"for fun\"... 215 The Silent Rise Of Fascism"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"There are so many examples like these that most people have begun to regard them as \"normal\" and \"inevitable.\" In actual fact, they are merely the end-product of a \"mentality\" that is becoming increasingly widespread. Entire nations are being brainwashed from early on, brought up with such false notions as \"Life is a struggle, only the strong win,\" or \" Get them, before they get you,\" and who consistently see such messages in the films they watch, the songs they listen to, and the news stories prevalent in the media. The perpetrators reported in these stories usually come from the ranks of the uneducated in society. The \"elite\" of society, provoked by this same mentality, also carry out the similar crimes, but do so in a more hidden fashion, or in a manner that comes within their line of occupation, and are therefore less easily identifiable. This disturbing tendency towards violence in modern societies is well-known, but no solution can yet be found for it. One important impediment is the fact that this violence is regarded as \"normal.\" A second reason is that most people do not realize its true source. They think that the problem can be resolved by resorting to legal and security measures. But they are wrong. Of course, such \"technical\" measures are necessary, but the true solution lies in determining the source of this degeneration in society, and to cure the sickness ideologically. The source of this degeneration, as this book has tried to make evident, is Darwinism. Ideas such as \"Life is a struggle, and only the strong can win,\" and \"If you don't get them, they will get you,\" have their roots in Darwinism, are all ultimately responsible for the current increase in \"fascism in daily life\" throughout the world. Some people might object to this diagnosis, and say that \"most people who carry out violent actions have never heard of Darwinism.\" And this is partly true. Those who commit these increasing acts of violence may well never have heard of Darwinism. But those who govern that section of society and shape their perspective do draw their inspiration from Darwinism. This group is powerful and dominant in universities, the media, many scientific institutions, in the arts and literature, in cinema and television, and in many areas which influence the way people think. And it is they who disseminate the idea that \"Life is a struggle, and only the strong can win.\" This community, which guides society in its direction, believes blindly in Darwinism, and regard themselves, not as created by God and as 216 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"His servants with obligations towards Him, but as developed animals that have evolved from apes, and whose only purpose is \"conflict.\" This Darwinist ideology is regularly presented in newspapers, magazines and on the television.

Contrary to the claims of Darwinism, man is not an animal which came about by chance and whose only purpose in life is to fight. Man was created by God, and is responsible for living by the morals He has revealed. And, again contrary to Darwinist propaganda, science confirms the truth that the universe was divinely created, or creationism, not Darwinism. As revealed in the Koran: He is God—the Creator, the Maker, the Giver of Form. To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. Everything in the heavens and earth glorifies Him. He is the Almighty, the All-Wise. (Koran, 59:24) In order to escape the fascist influenced culture which denies creation by God, this so-called philosophy of Darwinism must be eradicated, and people freed from its deception. The important thing is, to silence those voices who whisper to others to believe: \"Be ruthless, shed blood, kill, this is your instinct, you are only an animal, and when you die your life will be over.\" When this voice is silenced, those it has hypnotized will be allowed to see the truth, and will understand their purpose. 217 The Silent Rise Of Fascism"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The Cure For Fascism Is Koranic Morality A s we have been witnessing all through this book, fascism is an ideology that has wreaked great harm on humanity. Not only was it the cause of the death and torture of millions of people because of their race, and the tragedy of the Second World War in the last century, but it has also sought to destroy all human values wherever it has emerged, by contributing to a \"climate of fear.\" In our day, it is widespread in Middle East, Latin American and African countries, but also in increasingly racist tendencies and neo-Nazi organizations in the West. Fascism is actually the hidden ideology in many countries in the world, even if is not actually called by that name. Fascist thinking is also spreading to the \"streets\" in many countries, and entire communities are now emerging, who barbarically enjoy violence and bloodshed. For this reason, the whole world must embark on a \"fight against fascism.\" This cannot be carried out by legal and police measures only. This ideology cannot be destroyed by following the neo-Nazis, or identifying the guilty and imprisoning them, or by bombing this or that country with a fascist regime. On the contrary, it will only grow and further develop through such tactics. In order to defeat fascism, it is first necessary to understand what fascism is. As this book has attempted to make clear, fascism is a culture. At its roots are paganism, the Darwinist concept of \"conflict,\" and Darwinian racism. In order for fascism to be done away with, these superstitions need to be torn down. However, the methods used tend to produce the opposite of the desired effects. The Western nations which confront fascist gangs and spend millions of dollars on trying to catch, punish and destroy them, are actually all the while assisting in the spread of fascist groups, because they offer a Darwinist education to their young people. They teach them that life is an arena of brutality, a battleground, and that one has to be ruthless and fight in order to survive. They also propagate the idea that man is a species of animal that evolved from an ape-like creature, and therefore, that there are \"advanced\"and \"backward\" races in this evolutionary process.

And so, fascism is spreading, both as a spontaneous cultural phenomenon as well as on a systematic level. For this reason, countries such as Germany and Great Britain are caught in a terrible contradiction, essentially raising fascists which they are then eventually forced to fight. It is like rearing a large number of poisonous snakes, then throwing them among people, and when the snakes begin killing people, ask \"Why are they killing people?\"and try to catch them one by one. It is meaningless to raise these poisonous snakes on the first place, and then to say, \"We can get rid of them by using proper surveillance and arrest methods.\" The solution is to destroy the methods or facilities in which they are reared. In order to get rid of fascism, Darwinism, the so-called scientific basis of the ideology, has to be defeated and people have to instead be taught the concepts of love, affection, compassion, humility, tolerance, and justice. The foundation of these concepts is the Koran. The ethics of the Koran, revealed to us by God, are the basis of a world at peace, not pagan morality, which is the basis of fascism, and which encourages people to engage in war, bloodshed, violence and racism. A society steeped in Koranic morality will have no place for fascism, nor its \"red\" version, communism. Turkey is a good example of this. None of the efforts to import fascist and communist ideologies to the country have been successful long-term. Turkey has essentially remained uninfected by both totalitarian ideologies. The most important reason for this is the basic moral values the Turkish nation has acquired from Islam. Turkey, as the representative of these values and as the inheritor of the Ottoman Empire, could form a model that would prevent fascism, first within its own borders, and then in the whole world. There were and are fascist regimes surrounding Turkey on all sides, (Iraq, for instance, or Serbia). Conflict and chaos rule in the Balkans and the Middle East. Bringing these regions, so replete in fascist violence, back to peace and calm, as the Ottomans once did, can be achieved by a nation which implements a policy based upon these same values. Let us hope that this happens, and that leaders described by God in a holy verse, \"...Would that there had been more people with a vestige of good among the generations of those who came before you, who forbade corruption in the earth?\" (Koran, 11:116) will finally do away with fascism forever in the 21st century."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"D arwinism, which seeks to deny the fact of creation in the universe, is nothing but an unscientific fallacy. This theory, which argues that life originated from inanimate matter through coincidences, has been demolished with the recognition that the universe was created by God. It is God Who created the universe and Who designed it down to its smallest detail. Therefore, it is impossible for the theory of evolution, which holds that living beings are not created by God, but are products of coincidences, to be true. Unsurprisingly, when we look at the theory of evolution, we see that this theory is denounced by scientific findings. The design in life is extremely complex and striking. In the inanimate world, for instance, we can explore how sensitive are the balances which atoms rest upon, and further, in the animate world, we can observe in what complex designs these atoms were brought together, and how extraordinary are the mechanisms and structures such as proteins, enzymes, and cells, which are manufactured with them. This extraordinary design in life invalidated Darwinism at the end of the 20th century. We have dealt with this subject in great detail in some of our other studies, and shall continue to do so. However, we think that, considering its importance, it will be helpful to make a short summary here as well. The Scientific Collapse of Darwinism Although a doctrine going back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the 19th century. The most important development that made the theory the top topic of the world of science was the book by Charles Darwin titled \"The Origin of Species\" published in 1859. In this book, Darwin denied that different living species on the earth were created separately by God. According to Darwin, all living beings had a common ancestor and they diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an \"assumption.\" Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled \"Difficulties of the Theory,\" the theory was failing M M I I S S C C O O N N C C E E P P T T I I O O N N O O F F M M I I S S C C O O N N C C E E P P T T I I O O N N O O F F E E V V O O L L U U T T I I O O N N E E V V O O L L U U T T I I O O N N"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"in the face of many critical questions. Darwin invested all his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve the \"Difficulties of the Theory.\" However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism against science can be reviewed under three basic topics: 1) The theory can by no means explain how life originated on the earth. 2) There is no scientific finding showing that the \"evolutionary mechanisms\" proposed by the theory have any power to evolve at all. 3) The fossil record proves completely the contrary of the suggestions of the theory of evolution. In this section, we will examine these three basic points in general outlines: Charles Darwin"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The First Insurmountable Step: The Origin of Life The theory of evolution posits that all living species evolved from a single living cell that emerged on the primitive earth 3.8 billion years ago. How a single cell could generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, of the first step of the alleged evolutionary process it has to be inquired: How did this \"first cell\" originate? Since the theory of evolution denies creation and does not accept any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the \"first cell\" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan, or arrangement. According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. This, however, is a claim inconsistent with even the most unassailable rules of biology. \"Life Comes from Life\" In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, the theory asserting that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. Similarly, worms developing in meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, only some time later was it understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye. Even in the period when Darwin wrote The Origin of Species , the belief that bacteria could come into existence from non-living matter was widely accepted in the world of science. However, five years after the publication of Darwin's book, Louis Pasteur announced his results after long studies and experiments, which disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin’s theory. In his triumphal 222 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, Pasteur said, \"Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment.\" 148 Advocates of the theory of evolution resisted the findings of Pasteur for a long time. However, as the development of science unraveled the complex structure of the cell of a living being, the idea that life could come into being coincidentally faced an even greater impasse. Inconclusive Efforts in the 20th Century The first evolutionist who took up the subject of the origin of life in the 20th century was the renowned Russian biologist Alexander Oparin. With various theses he advanced in the 1930's, he tried to prove that the cell of a living being could originate by coincidence. These studies, however, were doomed to failure, and Oparin had to make the following confession: \"Unfortunately, however, the problem of the origin of the cell is perhaps the most obscure point in the whole study of the evolution of organisms. 149 Evolutionist followers of Oparin tried to carry out experiments to solve the problem of the origin of life. The best known of these experiments was carried out by American chemist Stanley Miller in 1953. Combining the gases he alleged to have existed in the primordial earth's atmosphere in an experiment set-up, and adding energy to the mixture, Miller synthesized several organic molecules (amino acids) present in the structure of proteins. Barely a few years had passed before it was revealed that this experiment, which was then presented as an important step in the name of evolution, was invalid, the atmosphere used in the experiment having been very different from real earth conditions. 150 After a long silence, Miller confessed that the atmosphere medium he used was unrealistic. 151 All the evolutionist efforts put forth throughout the 20th century to explain the origin of life ended with failure. The geochemist Jeffrey Bada from San Diego Scripps Institute accepts this fact in an article published in Earth Magazine in 1998: Today as we leave the twentieth century, we still face the biggest unsolved problem that we had when we entered the twentieth century: How did life originate on Earth? 152 223 Misconception of Evolution"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The Complex Structure of Life The primary reason why the theory of evolution ended up in such a big impasse about the origin of life is that even the living organisms deemed the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living being is more complex than all of the technological products produced by man. Today, even in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing inorganic materials together. The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quantity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability of proteins, the building blocks of cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10 950 for an average protein made up of 500 amino acids. In mathematics, a probability smaller than 1 over 10 50 is practically considered to be impossible. The DNA molecule, which is located in the nucleus of the cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. It is calculated that if the information coded in DNA were written down, this would make a giant library consisting of 900 volumes of encyclopedias of 500 pages each. A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: the DNA can only replicate with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can only be realized by the information coded in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute from the University of San Diego, California, confesses this fact in the September 1994 issue of the Scientific American magazine: It is extremely improbable that proteins and nucleic acids, both of which are structurally complex, arose spontaneously in the same place at the same time. Yet it also seems impossible to have one without the other. And so, at first glance, one might have to conclude that life could never, in fact, have originated by chemical means. 153 No doubt, if it is impossible for life to have originated from natural causes, then it has to be accepted that life was \"created\" in a supernatural way. This fact explicitly invalidates the theory of evolution, whose main purpose is to deny creation. 224 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Imaginary Mechanisms of Evolution The second important point that negates Darwin's theory is that both concepts put forward by the theory as \"evolutionary mechanisms\" were understood to have, in reality, no evolutionary power. Darwin based his evolution allegation entirely on the mechanism of \"natural selection\". The importance he placed on this mechanism was evident in the name of his book: The Origin of Species, By Means Of Natural Selection... Natural selection holds that those living things that are stronger and more suited to the natural conditions of their habitats will survive in the struggle for life. For example, in a deer herd under the threat of attack by wild animals, those that can run faster will survive. Therefore, the deer herd will be comprised of faster and stronger individuals. However, unquestionably, this mechanism will not cause deer to evolve and transform themselves into another living species, for instance, horses. Therefore, the mechanism of natural selection has no evolutionary power. Darwin was also aware of this fact and had to state this in his book The Origin of Species : Natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual differences or variations occur. 154 Lamarck's Impact So, how could these \"favorable variations\" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science in his age. According to the French biologist Lamarck, who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation and these traits, accumulating from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, according to Lamarck, giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. Darwin also gave similar examples, and in his book The Origin of Species , for instance, said that some bears going into water to find food transformed themselves into whales over time. 155 225 Misconception of Evolution"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"However, the laws of inheritance discovered by Mendel and verified by the science of genetics that flourished in the 20th century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fell out of favor as an evolutionary mechanism. Neo-Darwinism and Mutations In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the \"Modern Synthetic Theory\", or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings because of external factors such as radiation or replication errors, as the \"cause of favorable variations\" in addition to natural mutation. Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo- Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings present on the earth formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms such as the ears, eyes, lungs, and wings, underwent \"mutations,\" that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they always cause harm to them. The reason for this is very simple: the DNA has a very complex structure and random effects can only cause harm to it. American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows: Mutations are small, random, and harmful. They rarely occur and the best possibility is that they will be ineffectual. These four characteristics of mutations imply that mutations cannot lead to an evolutionary development. A random change in a highly specialised organism is either ineffectual or harmful. A random change in a watch cannot improve the watch. It will most probably harm it or at best be ineffectual. An earthquake does not improve the city, it brings destruction. 156 Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented as an \"evolutionary mechanism,\" is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living beings, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation 226 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"on human beings is cancer). No doubt, a destructive mechanism cannot be an \"evolutionary mechanism.\" Natural selection, on the other hand, \"can do nothing by itself\" as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no \"evolutionary mechanism\" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, neither could any imaginary process called evolution have taken place. 227 Misconception of Evolution Since the beginning of the century, evolutionists have been trying to produce mutations in fruit flies, and give this as an example for useful mutation. However, the only result obtained at the end of these efforts that lasted for decades were disfigured, diseased, and defective flies."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The Fossil Record: No Sign of Intermediate Forms The clearest evidence that the scenario suggested by the theory of evolution did not take place is the fossil record. According to the theory of evolution, every living species has sprung from a predecessor. A previously existing species turned into something else in time and all species have come into being in this way. According to the theory, this transformation proceeds gradually over millions of years. Had this been the case, then numerous intermediary species should have existed and lived within this long transformation period. For instance, some half-fish/half-reptiles should have lived in the past which had acquired some reptilian traits in addition to the fish traits they already had. Or there should have existed some reptile-birds, which acquired some bird traits in addition to the reptilian traits they already had. Since these would be in a transitional phase, they should be disabled, defective, crippled living beings. Evolutionists refer to these imaginary creatures, which they believe to have lived in the past, as \"intermediate forms.\" If such animals had really existed, there should be millions and even billions of them in number and variety. More importantly, the remains of these strange creatures should be present in the fossil record. In The Origin of Species , Darwin explained: If my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all of the species of the same group together must assuredly have existed... Consequently, evidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil remains. 157 228 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM The fossil record is a great barricade in front of the theory of evolution. The fossil record shows that living species emerged suddenly and fully-formed without any evolutionary transitional form between them. This fact is evidence that species are created separately. A living stingray and a fossil stingray"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Darwin's Hopes Shattered However, although evolutionists have been making strenuous efforts to find fossils since the middle of the 19th century all over the world, no transitional forms have yet been uncovered. All the fossils unearthed in excavations showed that, contrary to the expectations of evolutionists, life appeared on earth all of a sudden and fully-formed. A famous British paleontologist, Derek V. Ager, admits this fact, even though he is an evolutionist: The point emerges that if we examine the fossil record in detail, whether at the level of orders or of species, we find – over and over again – not gradual evolution, but the sudden explosion of one group at the expense of another. 158 This means that in the fossil record, all living species suddenly emerge as fully formed, without any intermediate forms in between. This is just the opposite of Darwin's assumptions. Also, it is very strong evidence that living beings are created. The only explanation of a living species emerging suddenly and complete in every detail without any evolutionary ancestor can be that this species was created. This fact is admitted also by the widely known evolutionist biologist Douglas Futuyma: Creation and evolution, between them, exhaust the possible explanations for the origin of living things. Organisms either appeared on the earth fully developed or they did not. If they did not, they must have developed from pre-existing species by some process of modification. If they did appear in a fully developed state, they must indeed have been created by some omnipotent intelligence. 159 Fossils show that living beings emerged fully developed and in a perfect state on the earth. That means that \"the origin of species\" is, contrary to Darwin's supposition, not evolution but creation. The Tale of Human Evolution The subject most often brought up by the advocates of the theory of evolution is the subject of the origin of man. The Darwinist claim holds that the 229 Misconception of Evolution"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"modern men of today evolved from some kind of ape-like creatures. During this alleged evolutionary process, which is supposed to have started 4-5 million years ago, it is claimed that there existed some \"transitional forms\" between modern man and his ancestors. According to this completely imaginary scenario, four basic \"categories\" are listed: 1. Australopithecus 2. Homo habilis 3. Homo erectus 4. Homo sapiens Evolutionists call the so-called first ape-like ancestors of men \"Australopithecus\" which means \"South African ape.\" These living beings are actually nothing but an old ape species that has become extinct. Extensive research done on various Australopithecus specimens by two world famous anatomists from England and the USA, namely, Lord Solly Zuckerman and Prof. Charles Oxnard, has shown that these belonged to an ordinary ape species that became extinct and bore no resemblance to humans. 160 Evolutionists classify the next stage of human evolution as \"homo,\" that is \"man.\" According to the evolutionist claim, the living beings in the Homo series are more developed than Australopithecus. Evolutionists devise a fanciful evolution scheme by arranging different fossils of these creatures in a particular order. This scheme is imaginary because it has never been proved that there is an evolutionary relation between these different classes. Ernst Mayr, one of the most important proponents of the theory of evolution in the 20th century, contends in his book One Long Argument that \"particularly historical [puzzles] such as the origin of life or of Homo sapiens, are extremely difficult and may even resist a final, satisfying explanation.\" 161 By outlining the link chain as \"Australopithecus > Homo habilis > Homo erectus > Homo sapiens,\" evolutionists imply that each of these species is one another's ancestor. However, recent findings of paleoanthropologists have revealed that Australopithecus, Homo habilis and Homo erectus lived at different parts of the world at the same time. 162 Moreover, a certain segment of humans classified as Homo erectus have lived up until very modern times. Homo sapiens neandarthalensis and Homo sapiens sapiens (modern man) co-existed in the same region. 163 230 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"This situation apparently indicates the invalidity of the claim that they are ancestors of one another. A paleontologist from Harvard University, Stephen Jay Gould, explains this deadlock of the theory of evolution although he is an evolutionist himself: What has become of our ladder if there are three coexisting lineages of hominids (A. africanus, the robust australopithecines, and H. habilis), none clearly derived from another? Moreover, none of the three display any evolutionary trends during their tenure on earth. 164 Put briefly, the scenario of human evolution, which is sought to be upheld with the help of various drawings of some \"half ape, half human\" creatures appearing in the media and course books, that is, frankly, by means of propaganda, is nothing but a tale with no scientific ground. Lord Solly Zuckerman, one of the most famous and respected scientists in the U.K., who carried out research on this subject for years, and particularly studied Australopithecus fossils for 15 years, finally concluded, despite being an evolutionist himself, that there is, in fact, no such family tree branching out from ape-like creatures to man. Zuckerman also made an interesting \"spectrum of science.\" He formed a spectrum of sciences ranging from those he considered scientific to those he considered unscientific. According to Zuckerman's spectrum, the most \"scientific\"–that is, depending on concrete data–fields of science are chemistry and physics. After them come the biological sciences and then the social sciences. At the far end of the spectrum, which is the part considered to be most \"unscientific,\" are \"extra-sensory perception\"–concepts such as telepathy and sixth sense–and finally \"human evolution.\" Zuckerman explains his reasoning: We then move right off the register of objective truth into those fields of presumed biological science, like extrasensory perception or the interpretation of man's fossil history, where to the faithful [evolutionist] anything is possible - and where the ardent believer [in evolution] is sometimes able to believe several contradictory things at the same time. 165 The tale of human evolution boils down to nothing but the prejudiced interpretations of some fossils unearthed by certain people, who blindly adhere to their theory. 231 Misconception of Evolution"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Technology In The Eye and The Ear Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of \"how we see\". Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the retina of the eye. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and they reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain called the center of vision. These electric signals are perceived in this center of the brain as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking. The brain is insulated from light. That means that the inside of the brain is solid dark, and light does not reach the location where the brain is situated. The place called the center of vision is a solid dark place where no light ever reaches; it may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness. The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the 20th century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you read, your hands with which you hold it, then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective having depth. For many years, ten of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three- dimensional TV, and reach the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system but it is not possible to watch it without putting on glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality. 232 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot? If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear; the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them; the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just like it is from light: it does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your brain, which is insulated from sound, you listen to the symphonies of an orchestra, and hear all the noises in a crowded place. However, if the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, it would be seen that a complete silence is prevailing there. As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality HI-FI systems produced by the biggest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a HI-FI you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the technology of the human body are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does HI-FI; it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man. So far, no visual or recording apparatus produced by man has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater fact lies beyond all this. 233 Misconception of Evolution"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"To Whom Does the Consciousness that Sees and Hears Within the Brain Belong? Who is it that watches an alluring world in its brain, listens to symphonies and the twittering of birds, and smells the rose? The stimulations coming from the eyes, ears, and nose of a human being travel to the brain as electro-chemical nervous impulses. In biology, physiology, and biochemistry books, you can find many details about how this image forms in the brain. However, you will never come across the most important fact about this subject: Who is it that perceives these electro-chemical nervous impulses as images, sounds, odors and sensory events in the brain? There is a consciousness in the brain that perceives all this without feeling any need for eye, ear, and nose. To whom does this consciousness belong? There is no doubt that this consciousness does not belong to the nerves, the fat layer and neurons comprising the brain. This is why Darwinist- materialists, who believe that everything is comprised of matter, cannot give any answer to these questions. For this consciousness is the spirit created by God. The spirit needs neither the eye to watch the images, nor the ear to hear the sounds. Furthermore, nor does it need the brain to think. Everyone who reads this explicit and scientific fact should ponder on Almighty God, should fear Him and seek refuge in Him, He Who squeezes the entire universe in a pitch-dark place of a few cubic centimeters in a three-dimensional, colored, shadowy, and luminous form. A Materialist Faith The information we have presented so far shows us that the theory of evolution is a claim evidently at variance with scientific findings. The theory's claim on the origin of life is inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the intermediate forms required by the theory never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas such as the earth-centered universe model have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history. However, the theory of evolution is pressingly kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against the theory as an \"attack on science.\" Why? 234 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"235 Misconception of Evolution The reason is that the theory of evolution is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some circles. These circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism because it is the only materialist explanation that can be put forward for the workings of nature. Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. A well known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is \"first and foremost a materialist and then a scientist\": It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absolute, so we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door. 166 These are explicit statements that Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to the materialist philosophy. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it argues that inanimate, unconscious matter created life. It insists that millions of different living species; for instance, birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whales and human beings originated as a result of the interactions between matter such as the pouring rain, the lightning flash, etc., out of inanimate matter. This is a precept contrary both to reason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so as \"not to allow a Divine Foot in the door.\" Anyone who does not look at the origin of living beings with a materialist prejudice will see this evident truth: All living beings are works of a Creator, Who is All-Powerful, All-Wise and All-Knowing. This Creator is God, Who created the whole universe from non-existence, designed it in the most perfect form, and fashioned all living beings. They sa›d ‘Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. You are the All-Know›ng, the All-W›se.’ (KORAN, 2:32)"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"236 FASCISM: THE BLOODY IDEOLOGY OF DARWINISM 1. http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/ mussolini- fascism.html 2.
