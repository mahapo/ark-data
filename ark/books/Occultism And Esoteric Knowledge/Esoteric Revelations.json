scriptures are types and ensamples (examples) of latter-day events. The Boo k of Revelation points us back to the Old Testament scri ptures, which contain prophecies that are fulfilled in our genera tion. All the prophecies written in the word of God concern the t wo messengers who manifest in every generation. The H oly Spirit of prophecy states that the volume (all) of the scr oll/book (scriptures) is written of the living messiah (see Psalm 40:7 ). The historical events that are written in the Bible are used as types. These types have been borrowed to construct biblical prophecies. Accordingly, the seven-sealed scroll o f life is understood through people and events that are recor ded in scripture. In a past type, Jerusalem rejected Ezek iel, Jeremiah, and all the prophets sent to counsel her. Today, t he Christian leadership (typifying old Jerusalem) listens only t o their own prophets, who know not the revelation of the scroll of life. Only the latter-day living anointed of God can reveal th e mysteries that are locked (sealed) in the pages of prophecy. The prophecies written in God’s word with the phrase “Thus saith the Lord” use the past scenario of events to reveal the future fulfillment. Though, the types of the past are often reversed or partly reversed when borrowed to constr uct written prophecy. Only the present living messenger of God has the vision to reveal the words of Elohiym. None of the rebellious will understand these things (present truth); only the wise shall understand. A wise person will have an ear to hear what the living anointed has to say regarding the scroll of life’s predictions, which take place in this last generati on. A seeker of present truth can know who is of G od and who is a deceiver by seeing who can unseal and reveal the seven-sealed scroll of life. This scroll of life is shown in th e Book of Revelation as being in the hand of the one who sits upon the throne. Beginning in Chapter 6, the Book of Revela tion illustrates in metaphorical language the scroll of life’s predictions – as also declared to the Old Testament prophets. In our day, the living anointed is revealing the unrol led scroll of life. Thereby, he has unlocked the written mysteri es that God declared in the volume of the scroll/book (see Psalm 40:7 )."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 There is no other test given for recognizing today’ s living messenger, who manifested unexpectedly as a thief i n the night. He has appeared to warn Christendom of the great an d dreadful day of tribulation before every eye shall see the a ffects of a great star’s arrival. All fasting, prayers, old law/belief-keeping, and offerings to God without the desire to understand God’s newly re vealed plan of salvation for today are done in vain and are poi ntless. The daily bread, which the professed believers of Chris t are to pray for, is the hidden manna (words of the scroll of li fe’s seventh angel). Words in the scroll of life are as grains of barley and wheat, which are baked as spiritual unleavened show bread cakes, wafers, and leavened wave-loaves. Present truth fe eds a person’s mind so that he or she may grow in strengt h and faith, just as John the Revelator ate the little scroll in Revelation 10:9 . The rebellious people of Christendom, instead, choo se to continue eating their defiled bread."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 CHAPTER 1 Darkness to Lightning As thoughts can take us back through time and space to the past, so the spiritual eyes of eternity have seen the not hing that existed before the Earth was formed, prior to when the cele stial stars were light, and before anything that is of physical matter had manifested. Hence, there was the nothingness of vo id and darkness, being anti-matter, existing as nothing in eternity. Each sub-particle of anti-matter is negative sub-conscio usness. These sub-particles of anti-matter were as one with etern ity from the time there was no space and no time. This anti-mat ter was the nothingness that existed in that state forever. Th rough eternity and from eternity, the dark non-existent particles of negative sub-consciousness progressively developed and event ually became conscious/light. The state of nothingness b ecame conscious of the womb of eternity, which has no beg inning and no ending. Negative sub-consciousness had an etern ity to develop from nothing (darkness) to something (light ). Accordingly, a light came on within the sub-conscio us mind of eternity. Light was the first conscious thought in time and the manifested universal space of eternity. The uncons cious (darkness) had become conscious (light) to manifest a thought. In other words, conscious-eternity was, in a new-bo rn sense, becoming vaguely aware. In the realm of time and s pace where this consciousness began to develop is the substanc e of eternity. From the first light developed all consciousness in the universe, which all particles of matter are of. All the know ledge contained in anti-matter and matter is likened to the darknes s and light in the mind of eternity. Out of chaotic consciousness progressed law and order in Earth’s solar system. Through this Earth’s progressive creation, the mind of eternity became enlightened to life. Thereby, thro ugh its enlightened thoughts, bodies of evolved matter adva nced its increasing consciousness to adult status. So thoug ht had matured and law of evolution was thereafter underst ood: from the physical morning-atom to the evolution of human s."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 Out of anti-matter came matter, developing a p rogressive attitude to naturally produce molecular images of i tself. Through this natural progression is how God matured . All creation is formed within the same sub-conscious an d conscious universal mind, where all things were developed. T he sub- consciousness developed its conscious companion to express itself through, as an equal in all things is the on ly companion the sub-conscious can naturally dwell with. From the m asculine first God – anti-matter – came forth God’s natural feminine equal, matter. Accordingly, their whole creation/f amily is made in their image. Out of the negative anti-matter of eternity – which is, as it were, masculine – came forth the positive matter, b eing as it were feminine, to complete the whole. There also e xisted neutrality when the negative and positive are mixin g together as one. The Earth’s solar system is the first and, at this time, only place of order that was created from the chaotic un iversal mind of God (darkness and light). God is negative and p ositive, masculine and feminine: God is eternity, inhabits e ternity, and personifies eternity. Elohiym (Gods: masculine and feminine) advanced a creation, which is part of themselves. All entities created from the negative and positive have differe nt levels of consciousness – a level of understanding. Humans h ave the greatest consciousness among all creatures. Eternity – being the one that is and has alway s been – is known to us as God: the highest consciousness, abov e all and is all and in all. God, the personification of mascul ine and feminine, advanced a creation that was a mirror ima ge of itself. Therefore, the highest consciousness progressively developed, in a natural way, appropriate bodies of matter, which genetically inherited varying degrees of consciousness. As the consciousness of Earth’s creation becam e enlightened – especially in humans – so God became enlightened. Each vessel genetically acquired a measure of consciousn ess and understanding. Humans were the last specie to evol ve, having the greatest awareness among all other previous for ms of evolved life. This meant that mankind was the grea test image of God over all the other earthen vessels. Accordingl y, mankind genetically received the greatest consciousness of a higher awareness. During the first creation, the highest divine consciousness would learn by experience which laws would"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 work in a harmonious creation, how its creation sho uld think and act, and by what principles the lower vessels of aw areness should live by. Everything we see with our eyes is interpreted by the brain. An image of what you see with your eyes is revealed in your mind. Eyes are only receptacles, which gather ligh t-wave particles to send this coded data to your brain to be processed and viewed. After the data is analyzed, an image w ill be seen in your mind, not in your eyes. The same principle ap plies to all your senses, data is collected and sent to the brai n for processing. This is only possible because eyes and genetics hav e evolved from a state of blindness to have the knowledge to decode the data that your evolved senses receive from their in digenous surroundings. In God’s perfect recreation, everything has a cause and effect upon each other in a harmonious way. Everything re lies on something else, like a never-ending revolving circl e. One thing supplies another, which is then converted for somet hing else to use and so on. In contradiction to God’s evolved l aws of nature, mankind is creating an ever-increasing strange worl d. Humans have converted the balanced elements into an unbala nced environment, which is out of synch with the cycle o f nature. The products that man makes are so contrary to creation that after their limited use is spent nothing can live off the product. When a product is recycled, this only results in more co ntamination, which nothing can breathe or eat. In God’s new cre ation, everything that is taken from something is restored by something else to complete the infinite cycle of creation. T his is the new image of eternity. The progression of God’s new cr eation is like a revolving circle, able to move in either directio n, having no beginning and no ending. After the first creation on this Earth was des troyed, twelve planets in our solar system were made new. Through the first world of this Earth, before Adam and Eve of Genesis , a progression of laws had manifested. The good thing s that were perceived from the first creation were used as the building blocks for the newly created planets in this solar system. On these new planets is where the angels dwelt as perfect humans . A male (Adam-type) and female (Eve-type) Lucifer were made in the expressed physical image of the masculine and femin ine Spirit of Elohiym on each of the twelve planets/stars. Our w orld was a"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 recall of one of the angels’ twelve perfect worlds when this world was replenished by Adam and Eve of Genesis. All the evening and morning stars (Lucifers) of the twelve newly created planets were made in the highest physical image of the highest masculine and feminine consciousness of the univers e. These Lucifers were once of the first humans to experienc e the evil things of the first creation followed by their offs pring. Awareness had evolved within the species of God’s f irst creation (being fully evolved within the minds of humans). Near the end of the first creation, Elohiym realized which princ iples of law would work harmoniously together without going wron g. The first law, which was naturally practiced in the fir st creation, was labeled as the knowledge of evil. Accordingly, the ways of the first creation were realized to be evil. From that time, evil experiences became contrary to the universal mind o f God. This evolved creation was perceived as evil through the humans living in that time. The only reason why things of evil are thought of as wrong is that the highest consciousness first experienced ev il through the experiences of the evolved species of the first cre ation. Thereby, it ultimately declared them to be evil. This genet ic information of experiencing the sensation of evil, an understan ding of right and wrong, is programmed into each human vessel (hu man body) that is born into this recalled world of ours . Thereby people can reveal their spirits’ true inclination. Those who choose the good doctrine of the two latter-day witn esses will realize that the evil things experienced in this wo rld do not work. Hence, through their actions, they can show how the y have the same mind as the living God – the highest conscious ness. Elohiym experienced, through the first creatio n, the first principles of good in contrast to evil. The highes t consciousness is referred to as Elohiym: masculine and feminine G ods. God, then knowing by experience what laws do work, knew to choose the good and reject the bad. The only reason peopl e of this recalled world understand good and bad is that the people of the first creation on Earth had already realized, throu gh experience, the difference between good and evil. We have the ability of knowing and experiencing the difference between goo d and evil through certain active genes in our DNA, which were passed down from generation to generation. From the genet ics of Adam and Eve of Genesis came the knowledge of good and e vil, once"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 they partook of the tree of good and evil. Enzymes in the fruit of the tree of good and evil activated in humans the d ormant genes to perceive evil characteristics mixed with the gen es pertaining to the perception of good characteristics. It is good for a man in perfection to have a w ife. God decided that there will be harmony if the male and female a re of each other, just as Eve was of Adam. They can telepathi cally perceive each others thoughts, without language. I n perfection, a husband and wife will be as one mind in two bodies, which are born as twins: hence they are brother, sister, and spouse. The two would not want to be with any other person. To each other, they are the most glorious beings they would desire – for they are as the same person divided into a male and fema le body. In this world, all things grow old, ugly, and die. In God’s kingdom, all things mature and then reverse to become new an d more beautiful. The ripened fruit on the tree of life c ontains enzymes that reverse the aging process. Thereby, humans wi ll achieve higher glories and advance in wisdom, so that we ma y experience where God has been, from glory to glory. In God’s new creation, everything will have its perfect mate . All the surroundings will be available for the perfect mate s to enjoy and be one with. Through this new doctrine, many shall attain to a higher level of consciousness over the other earthe n vessels (people). In the kingdom of God, there will be gre ater bodies of glory (maturity) for those who attain a great aware ness at this time through the scroll of life’s revelation. The first creation was destroyed and covered o ver with water and, as it were, figuratively encapsulated by a sea of glass (gemstone) around the firmament, so none would know God’s secret. A meteorite caused the destruction of all life that evolved in the first creation, as the chaos of the cosmos w as of the first creation of evil things. For evil thoughts to come into God’s universal mind, God requires its creation to be exp ressing evil. After the first creation was destroyed, God made al l things new in this solar system. Perfect human bodies were bo rn in the new creation for the former spirits of the first creati on to dwell in. These spirits (minds) had dwelt in the imperfect hu man bodies during the first creation. Perfect humans are know n to us as the angelic beings that dwelt on twelve new stars (plan ets) in the future. The world where we dwell at this time has the good ways of the angels’ new creation mixed with the evi l ways of the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 first creation. These ways are recalled back to ex istence to reveal the good spirits within the minds of people from the bad. Only the righteous spirits who accept this doctrine will be born again in their new heaven and new Earth. The angelic beings had not the inclination or the capability to question God in any way in regards to their existen ce. Melchizedek and Shekinah manifested as Metatron at twilight in the Edens of the angels’ worlds. Metatron was the light source of wisdom and knowledge for the Adams and Eves who dwelt on each of the twelve new planets in this solar system . A rebellious masculine Lucifer was the Adams on a third of twelv e planets. He was made in the image of the Highest Masculine Consciousness. The position of each Adam on twelve planets was equated with the covering angel who stood on th e mercy seat’s right side. The rebellious feminine Lucifer dwelt as the Eves on a third of the twelve planets. She was mad e in the expressed image of the Highest Feminine Consciousne ss. The position of each Eve was equated with the covering angel who stood on the mercy seat’s left side. The Adams and Eves created on two thirds of these twelve planets were the righ teous Lucifers who are of the highest consciousness of God, being the major part of God’s mind that did not rebel as the other minority-part of God’s mind rebelled. These Adams and Eves, whic h did not rebel on two thirds of the planets, are still equat ed with the position of the right and left hand covering angels upon the mercy seat. In the mind of these righteous Adams a nd Eves dwelt the spirit of Michael (righteous Adam) and Ga briel (righteous Eve). The Adams and Eves who dwelt upon a third of the stars (planets) in heaven have lost their previ ous position. All the angels who dwelt on twelve planets were per fect humans knowing only good. Rebellion in heaven was very su btle, where Melchizedek and Shekinah perceived pride springing up within the Lucifers who dwelt upon a third of the twelve p lanets. This pride caused all the angels born on these four plan ets to be like their mother (rebellious Eve) and father (rebelliou s Adam). Therefore, God returned to the beginning of the ang els’ world, hence our world, to deal with the rebellion that to ok place in the future. Our recalled world on Earth has been broug ht back in measure. It is the original abode of all the angel s, when they dwelt as imperfect humans who practiced mainly evil during the first creation."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 When the angels’ new worlds were created, God had blotted out its memory concerning the first creation upon E arth. Accordingly, God’s knowledge concerning the first c reation remained a secret until a subtle rebellion arose in the angels’ worlds. This reminded God of the past creation. P rior to the rebellion in heaven, the former things of the first creation did not come into the mind of the highest consciousness. O n a particular day, certain Adams and Eves and all their angels (o ffspring) became rebellious while dwelling on a third (four) of the new twelve planets. In the new heavens around the twelve new plane ts, the masculine and feminine mates are equal in all thing s. All the Lucifers dwelling on twelve planets were equated wi th the anointed covering cherubs who stood on the right an d left side of the ark’s mercy seat. These evening and morning st ars received new knowledge from Elohiym (Melchizedek and Shekina h). Thereafter, they passed this knowledge to their off spring. This meant that Adam and Eve, who were the first two of each new planet, would be wiser than their offspring, as the light of all new truth was given through them. Certain masculin e and feminine Lucifers – Adams and Eves who dwelt on a t hird of the new planets in this solar system – were created per fect in all their ways until God recognized they had become proud. T hese rebellious evening and morning stars (Lucifers) are of the same spirit, which is that part of God that became proud . All their angels upon their planets also became proud, since they are of the same spirit as their parents. Prior to the reb ellion, the masculine and feminine Lucifers would always direct the adoration from the angelic beings to the light sour ce: Metatron. God had no choice but to return to this past r ecalled world of ours, so the subtle rebellion of the rebellious Luc ifers and their rebellious angels could be seen for what it is. Ac cordingly, each spirit within the mind of every angel has been gene tically placed in the mind of each human body that now has the abi lity to do good and evil. The rebellious Lucifers and the reb ellious angels could not perceive their subtle rebellion. Their p erfect human bodies could not outwardly express their spirits’ t rue inclination. These rebellious Adams and Eves and their rebelliou s angels, who dwelt on a third part of the new stars/planets, are all a part of God’s universal mind. All the rebellious are th at part of God’s mind which prefers a world where the knowledg e to do"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 good and evil exists. The majority of God’s consci ous mind – which is of the same mind as the righteous Adams an d Eves and their angels who dwelt on two thirds of the new sta rs – prefer the way things were in the new worlds. Each rebellious Lucifer and their offspring were more inclined to the ways of t he first creation; hence, the reason why iniquity was found in them. Accordingly, the dormant genetics of evil inclinati ons began to awaken the minds of the rebellious angels to the se nsation of pride. Had God allowed the subtle rebellion of pri de to continue, eventually all the evil ways of the first creation would have been practiced on these angels’ four planets. The archangel Michael and archangel Gabriel we re of the same mind as the righteous Adam (image of Melchized ek) and Eve (image of Shekinah) on each of the angels’ eigh t new planets. These evening and morning stars were the masculine and feminine manifestation of the highest conscious ness. Lucifer is a title of each Adam and Eve on each of the twelve planets. These Lucifers were the greatest physical manifestation of God in human form. The children of these evenin g (moon) and morning (sun) stars were the next physical mani festation of God in human form and so on. The righteous feminin e Lucifers (Eves) who dwelt on two thirds of the planets, whic h did not rebel, are referred to as that part of God which is of the Spirit of Shekinah and Gabriel. These angels are able to par take of the tree of life’s ripened fruits, which reverse the ag ing process, before certain dormant genetics within them pertain ing to the awareness of evil are awakened. The enzymes in thi s tree’s fruit are able to keep these genetics dormant. This tree ’s fruit takes hundreds of years to ripen. All minerals, plants, animals and anything in this universe are all a part of the consciousness of God; they are al l created by thoughts in the universal mind of eternity. The an gels (perfect humans) who dwelt on one third of twelve planets we re born of the rebellious Adams and Eves. They are of that pa rt of God which prefers the ways of this world where we dwell . The rebellious on this Earth will reject the latter-day physical manifestation of the two witnesses – Michael and Ga briel in human form. These two anointed messengers have the same mind as the Adams and Eves who dwelt on two thirds of the angels’ planets. None of the rebellious on Earth a re of the righteous Adams and Eves’ children. These children dwelt as"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 the righteous angels in heaven. When the righteous on Earth accept the two lat ter-day witnesses, it reveals that they were once an angel who was born from the loins of a righteous Adam and Eve in heave n in this solar system. The Adams and Eves who dwelt on a th ird of the stars (planets) of this solar system subtly rebelle d after they were created perfect. All the past memories of the firs t destroyed creation were hidden within the darkness of God’s u niversal mind. Therefore, since the mind in every angel (or human of our world) is the image of God’s mind, the rebellious a ngels were able to find the taboo knowledge within their own m inds. The mind of the rebellious, as it were, reached out and took hold of pride, which was hidden within certain dormant gene s of evil. The righteous Adams and Eves were not that way incl ined, just as their offspring on two thirds of the newly creat ed planets were like-minded. All angels in heaven were given eternal life w ith no requirements and had access to the tree of life. G od could not arbitrarily destroy the rebellious in heaven withou t violating God’s law by which everything exists. However, God has the ability to turn back time, since all creation and t ime exists in the mind of God. At any time, God can revisit any past event that has taken place within its universal mind. When Go d recalled this world, all thoughts pertaining to the angels’ worlds then resided in its sub-conscious mind. Through the way s of our recalled world, God will reveal the minds of the re bellious angels by showing them that these ways of good mixe d with evil do not work. During and after the biblically prophesied mil lennium, the plan of God will be revealed to the rebellious ange ls in the judgment. At that time, the scrolls, which recorde d every past generation, and then the scroll of life – which rec ords this last generation and the biblical millennium – are reveal ed to them. These scrolls will show how the rebellious on Earth rejected and persecuted the living anointed in each generation a nd the righteous who believed the living messenger’s doctr ine. The rebellious humans who once dwelt as rebellious ange ls on a third of the planets will have played their part in each scroll. When the rebellious angels view the scrolls during the j udgment, then they will agree that God is righteous and just to b lot the rebellious of this world out of existence. At that time, the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 rebellious angels in heaven will not immediately re alize that they were the rebellious in this recalled world. All th e rebellious will be shown how they lived their lives on Earth that w as contrary to the latter-day plan of salvation. This is the reas on why Melchizedek and Shekinah revisited, in our recalled world, the ways of the first creation mixed with the ways of t he angels’ new creation – to reveal the righteous spirits in contr ast to rebellious spirits. This could only be accomplished by geneti cally placing each spirit (character/mind) that was in the mind o f an angel into the mind of each person living in this world. The ways of this recalled world are designed to amplify the subtle r ebellion that took place in the future worlds, since our minds ca n perceive good and evil. God had condemned the original evil ways of th e first creation, which are now revisited in this recalled world. Once the rebellious humans of this recalled world are ju dged during and after the biblical millennium, all things there after will be shown from the scroll of life’s record as having b een made new during the biblical millennium. The first creation that manifested evil was necessary to establish good law s and principles that would be used in all of God’s new c reation. The former evil ways, which were once practiced in the Earth’s first creation, and the good things of the angels’ new wo rlds are what we in this recalled world are experiencing in measu re. It took six days for Elohiym to recall from it s mind all that is of this recalled world. When Adam and Eve were pla ced in the recalled Garden of Eden, they were commanded to “re plenish” the Earth; hence to “refill” the Earth as it once w as. Adam and Eve of this world were a mirror image of the rebell ious Adams and Eves who dwelt on a third of the new planets in heaven. In the recalled Eden was the tree with the knowledge o f good and evil. This tree was already in the Garden of Eden before Adam and Eve of Genesis had sinned. God already had the understanding of evil because it was practiced in t he first creation. The fruits of the tree containing the kn owledge of good and evil paralleled the thoughts within the mind of Adam and Eve of Genesis. A serpent’s actions of eating the forbidden fr uit over a period of months beguiled Eve. The serpent personified Ada m and Eve’s inclination to partake of their thoughts rega rding the forbidden fruit, just as the Adams and Eves who dwe lt on a third"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 of the angels’ planets subtly rebelled and became p roud. This subtle rebellion is equated with the rebellion of A dam and Eve in this world; they desired the taboo fruit and succum bed to the beguiling subliminal words of the serpent when it a te the forbidden fruit without dying. The serpent in the Garden of Eden is likened to the thoughts in the minds of the rebellious Lucifers, dwelling on a third of the angels’ twelve planets, who partake of their own beguiling thoughts (fruits). The tree of the knowledge of good and evil wit h the serpent – in those days serpents naturally dwelt on the limbs of trees – brought a chain of events into play. Hence, the aw areness of evil and good would reveal the subtle rebellion that too k place upon four rebellious stars (planets). All the spirits i n the righteous angels who did not rebel in heaven are in the same humans in this world who will be saved, since they shall play the part as a believer of the Chosen Vessel’s new doctrine in thi s recalled world. Therefore, these latter-day saints choose t o play a part in the scroll of life’s record as faithful saints when they accept, support, and promote the living anointed’s proclama tion of the seventh angel’s warnings. The righteous who accept the new doctrine of this latter-day living messenger confes s on Earth that this world’s ways do not work; thereby, they are in agreement with the majority of God’s mind. However, the rebe llious who reject the new doctrine of the latter-day living an ointed will, during the judgment, also confess that the majority of God’s mind is righteous. All the scrolls, which recorded the events of past generations, and the scroll of life – which is recording all eve nts of this last generation and the initial 1,000 years of a new Ear th – will be revealed to the rebellious angels during the judgme nt. At that time, they will be made to realize that there is no place for them in this recalled world or the new creation of God. The last scroll/scroll of life will have blotted the rebelli ous from its record when they perish in the time of trouble. Th e rebellious are the minority part of God’s creation.

A meteorite caused the first creation to be destroy ed with lava, which became a flood of water (see Genesis 1:2 ) . The evil of the first creation was hid under this water.

His ministry is recorded on the initial four of sev en parts of the scroll of life’s first side, while his death is rec orded on the fifth and sixth parts (see Revelation 6:9 ). The Even-Kid Goat of this last generation had the same spirit in his mind as was in the body of Jesus/Yahshua.

After the total failure o f the first latter-day Man Child’s ministry on April 19, 1993, the Chosen Vessel, as it were, received latter-day Elijah’s (first latter-da y Man Child’s) mantle.

Before our world was recalled, as recorded in Genesis, the Earth was covered in water (see Genesis 1:2 ). The first chapter of Genesis reveals Elohiym recalling this world in six days. All the good things of this world are of the angels’ wo rlds mixed with the evil inclinations of the first creation. This reveals how all things of our world, which were recalled in the first week of Genesis, had already existed upon the Earth prior t o the recreation of Adam and Eve of Genesis. All events that took place in our recalled world were allowed to play th rough from the beginning to its end during the first timeline. Thereafter, all generations are being replayed over and over.

The four beasts in Revelation 4:6 have eyes before and behind. This reveals that they will have received the duplicate sun’s light (eyes before) and the moon’s light (eye s behind), according to the scroll of life’s seventh angel’s r ecord. Therefore, they understand the seventh angel’s warn ings of what is about to take place in the last generation of ou r world. These four six-winged beasts represent the Chosen Vessel’ s followers, who are of the first latter-day group of redeemed. When a person receives the seventh angel’s knowledge, then that person is able to clearly see the past types and their rel ationship to the fulfillment of latter-day prophecies. Genesis 1:27 So God {Elohiym: Father and Mother} created MAN {humans} in his {Elohiym’s} own IMAGE {male and female is God’s image, see Romans 1:23, 26, 27 } , in the image of God {Elohiym: masculine and feminine, plural, equals} created HE {Metatron} HIM {Adam} ; male and female created he THEM {Adam and Eve} . 1:28 And God {Elohiym/Metatron: Gods, plural} blessed them {Adam and Eve} , and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and REPLENISH {which means to put back something that once existed upon the Earth} the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over th e fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon t he earth. The flood of Noah covered the past sinful worl d beneath it, just as the waters in Genesis 1:2 concealed the destruction of the first creation beneath the waters. After the flood of Noah, God also told Noah to REPLENISH the Earth, just as God told Adam and Eve in Genesis 1:28 . Genesis 9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and REPLENISH the earth {in other words, put back something that was before Noa h’s flood;"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 hence, re-populate the Earth} . Before God recreated Adam and Eve as recorded in Genesis, the masculine and feminine Lucifers had already sub tly rebelled on a third of the new planets in heaven. The bring ing forth of Adam and Eve of Genesis in this world was because o f the subtle rebellion that took place in the angels’ wor lds. This recreated Earth where we dwell is for the sole purp ose of revealing the righteous spirits of angels, who did not rebel in heaven, in contrast to the rebellious spirits of an gels who did rebel in heaven. A spirit (character) dwelt within each of the minds of perfect human bodies of angels. Now each of these same spirits dwells in the mind of a human body, wh ich is born in this recreated Earth that has the ability to do good and evil. The angels in heaven had no way of comprehendi ng evil, since they were perfect human beings. Therefore, i t is only through the actions of people born in this world th at God can show the rebellious angels the consequence of their rebellion in the time of judgment. Ezekiel 28:9 Wilt THOU {Lucifer} yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man {in every generation, there has been one or more sons and dau ghters of perdition who had in their body the same spirit tha t dwelt in the rebellious Lucifers/Adam and Eves} , and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee. After the first creation, God (being masculine and feminine) created in the Earth’s solar system physical worlds . Through these worlds, God expressed its greatest masculine and feminine image. Twelve new stars (planets) and their moons were created in the future of this solar system for the angels t o dwell in. Thereafter, when rebellion arose in heaven, God ret urned to the beginning of the angels’ new worlds to recall our p resent world into existence. Genesis 37:9 And HE {Joseph, son of Jacob} dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the SUN and the MOON and the ELEVEN STARS {angels’ planets} made obeisance to ME {Joseph represented the twelfth planet} ."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 Joseph, through the Holy Spirit, was describin g our solar system where the angels dwelt in the future. The t welfth planet was symbolized by Joseph. His eleven brethren symb olized the other eleven stars (planets), which are also mentio ned in Genesis 37:10 . Revelation 12:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a WOMAN {this woman represents, in the first instance, the Holy Spirit, whose image was the Eves in heaven} clothed with the SUN, and the MOON {symbolizing the Adams} under her feet, and upon her head a crown of TWELVE STARS {these twelve stars represent the angels’ twelve planets} : Upon the twelve new stars dwelt Her (Holy Spir it’s) children (angelic beings), just as Eve brought forth her chi ldren upon the Earth. All the Eves on twelve stars/planets were m ade in the image of the woman in heaven. The Adams on these t welve stars were made in the image of Melchizedek, who pe rsonifies the moon’s light. Today, the feminine Holy Spirit personifies the scroll of life’s second side and spiritual New Jerusalem (church) on Earth. The face of the heavenly woman is as the regular sun in the daylight part of a day. Round a bout her crown are twelve stars, just as the planets in this solar system revolve around the sun. Once the rebellious humans in this world have been blotted out of the scroll of life’s record – h ence, out of creation – the righteous humans will be born as per fect angels in the new worlds of this solar system. At that time, it will seem as if rebellion never arose, since all memory of the p ast will be erased from the universal conscious mind of God (sc roll of life’s seventh angel). All things are created as thoughts in God’s (s eventh angel’s) mind. Therefore, God can recall any thought that h as been, whether in the past or the future, and replay it as many times as the universal mind of God wants. The generation we live in is played over many times, so the latter-day redeemed can be gathered in small groups. At the same time, these replays reveal the repeated actions of rebellious people who follo w their same rebellious path to destruction each time. God recreated twelve planets in our solar syst em that were designed for each separate tribe of the angels to l ive on. These twelve stars (planets) parallel the twelve sons/tri bes of Jacob. As"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 some of the tribes of Israel took their possessions outside the Promised Land, this attitude reflected the subtle r ebellion that took place on one third of the twelve planets. Scripture reveals that around the Earth was a figurative gemstone foundation to illustrate that a past once existed beneath this figurative sea of glass, which encapsulated th e former destroyed world of the first creation. The Book o f Isaiah illustrates how God’s judgment-throne is sitting on a sea of glass/gemstone in the future of our recalled world. Accordingly, God’s throne (Mount of Eden) is in each Eden of the angels’ world during the time of the judgment. Isaiah 40:21 Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not under stood from the foundations of the earth? 40:22 It is HE {God} that SITTETH {upon his throne on the Mt. of Eden/Zion, see Revelation 4:2, 3 } upon the CIRCLE { figurative gemstone foundation/sea of glass} OF THE EARTH {in the future of our day} , and the INHABITANTS {below on this recalled Earth} thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them ou t as a tent to dwell in: Michael (Elijah-type) appeared in this last ge neration as the physical manifestation of the masculine part of Elo hiym. Thereafter, Gabriel (Elisha-type) manifested as the masculine image of the feminine part of Elohiym. During the biblically prophesied millennium, they will be figuratively re igning upon the throne according to the scroll of life’s first side. At that time, the redeemed within New Jerusalem, who are around t he figurative throne after the biblical millennium, ar e those whom the two witnesses (Michael and Gabriel) will have g athered in this world prior to the beginning of the 1,000-year period. This recalled Earth where we live reveals both evil, which once existed under the figurative sea of glass duri ng the first creation, and good – which existed in the angels’ w orlds above the sea of glass – simultaneously. God kept a secr et concerning the abode of the angels’ first habitat. Perfect hu mans (angels) were reborn on their newly created planets upon a f igurative sea of glass. Beneath this sphere of gemstone was the old destroyed world (see Revelation 4:6 ; Ezekiel 1:22 ). The sea of"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 glass/gemstone around the Earth refers to the terri ble-looking crystal (diamond), which is the same sea of gemston e in John the Revelator’s vision. The figurative sea of glass, w hich, as it were, was placed around the former creation of Earth, con veys that a past exists below it. As archeologists dig below t he ground to find the past, so the illustration of a gemstone fo undation (sea of glass) in heaven indicates that a former creation e xisted beneath it. Under the sea of glass (being a paved work, se e Exodus 24:10 , Ezekiel 1:26 ) was hidden the past destroyed world where the angels once lived as humans prior to our world being recalled. The Earth where we live incorporates the evils of the first creation; though, we are not reliving that fi rst creation as a carbon copy of it. When scripture refers to satan or angels visit ing our world, the mind of God is causing that unnatural scenario to materialize. Angels are perfect humans who do not fly but are ph ysically like us humans. However, they have no way of immediatel y expressing evil, since they were originally designe d to comprehend only good in their world. God is able t o supernaturally manifest angels on Earth to personif y a trait of evil or good. When the serpent tempted Eve and cau sed her to disobey God’s word, it personified a trait of the r ebellious feminine Lucifer (Eve), who given the opportunity i s as a serpent that beguiles people to rebel against God’s reveale d words of warning. God allowed Job to be plagued to reveal t he rebellious Lucifer’s character trait, which was personified as an adversary (satan) against Job in an attempt to prove God wron g. The satan who came to God with the sons of God in Job 1:6 was an illustration that God temporarily created to reveal a trait of the mind of the rebellious Lucifer. Job 1:6 Now there was a day {after the flood} when the sons of God {being the righteous Adams who dwelt on two thirds of the stars/planets} came to present themselves before the LORD {on the figurative sea of glass of their Eden’s mount} , and Satan came also among them {satan refers to a character trait in the mind of the Adams and Eves who dwelt on a third of the rebellious planets in heaven} .

All the righteous Eves who dwelt on two thirds of the plane ts have the same spirit of Gabriel dwelling in their mind. The earthly images of these particular Eves are the prophetesse s of God. When masculine angels are illustrated from the dupl icate sun’s point of view they are referred to as masculine ser aphs. According to the moon’s light, other masculine ange ls are referred to as masculine cherubs. The ark of the covenant, which God instructed Moses to build for the holy of holies (most holy room) of the sanc tuary, had two covering angels attached upon it. One covering ang el was on the right side, and another covering angel was upon the left side of the ark’s mercy seat (throne of God), where the She kinah’s glory would manifest between these angels. These two cov ering angels symbolize the spirits within the minds of al l the Lucifers, who were the Adams and Eves on two thirds of the tw elve stars. The Adams and Eves who rebelled on a third of the t welve planets are described as having the combined minds (characteristics) of a dragon, serpent, devil, and satan. The righteous Eves who dwelt on two thirds of the plane ts remained in the physical and spiritual image of the woman in heaven. In Genesis, God divided the waters that were c overing the first creation upon the Earth and set clouds of wat er-vapor in the sky/heaven to surround the atmosphere (see Genesis 1:6, 7 ). These waters that were placed around this Earth’s f irmament are a figurative representation of a sea of glass. The new worlds of the angels are each shown as being built upon a fig urative foundation (sea of glass) in the sky/heaven. This is God’s way of saying that our recalled world is taking place b eneath a figurative foundation of one of the twelve stories – gemstone foundations – in heaven (see Amos 9:6 ). Therefore we are, as it were, living in the past while the angels’ worlds a re in the future, as stated in Psalm 8:5 . Psalm 8:4 What is man {humans) , that thou art mindful of him? and the son {offspring} of man, that thou visitest him? 8:5 For thou {God} hast made him {mankind} a little lower"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 {hence, our world is a recall of the past that was hidden below a sea of glass of heaven/sphere of gemstone foundatio n} than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.

Accordingly, we are of the past beneath the figurat ive sea of glass of heaven, since each world of the angels is illustrated as being built in the future upon one of twelve gemsto ne foundations. A gemstone foundation is as a sphere around the first destroyed world on Earth. There was a whole world made of soil, trees, grass, rivers, an ocean, animals, a nd perfect humans (angels) dwelling on each figurative gemston e foundation. God once reigned over each new planet, as illu strated by God manifesting on a mount within each Eden, which was built on a sea of glass. A sea of glass illustrates the futur e foundation encircles, as a sphere, around the destroyed past c reation. After Armageddon is fulfilled on this recalled Earth, the reafter the spirit of the righteous Michael and the righteous G abriel will reign over the rebellious planets of the angels. B efore that can take place, this past Earth below the sea of glass had to be recalled to bring back the good and evil scenario t hat was hidden in the tree of good and evil. This knowledge of th e tree of evil and good was originally gained from the first evil creation on Earth and the new good creation of the angels’ twel ve worlds. Genesis 2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden {Eden} , and the TREE of KNOWLEDGE of GOOD and EVIL. All the trees were recalled back to existence on the third day in Genesis 1:11, 12 , including a new tree with the knowledge of good and evil. Mankind (Adam and Eve of Genesis) w as recalled during the evening’s and daylight’s twilig ht of the sixth day.

The spirits that dwelt in the rebellious Lucifers h ave been cast down to be born in this recalled Earth. Thereby, t heir subtle rebellion will be revealed in an expressive way. Isaiah 14:12 How art thou fallen from heaven {where the new planets of the angels were each created on a figura tive sea of glass) , O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut d own to the ground {this speaks of the time when the latter-day false prophet will be destroyed) , which didst weaken the nations! The mind of the dragon, which has the characte ristics of a serpent/beguiler, devil/tempter and satan/adversary , will be bound upon Earth in the lake of fire. Without any inhabitants on Earth, there is no way for the mind of the dragon t o express itself. After the biblically prophesied millennium in Revelation 20:7 , the mind of the dragon is restored. At that time , the rebellious, who died by plagues that culminated in the lake of fire in Revelation 19:20 , will have their lives restored to the time just prior to the Chosen Vessel revealing his doctr ine to spiritual Goshen/Christendom.

All life upon this recalled Earth – since the fall of Adam and Eve of Genesis – practices the knowledge of evil (m ixed with good), which God condemned in the first creation. After the destruction of the first creation, God saved every spirit (mind/character) that dwelt in humans and genetical ly placed each one in the perfect human body of an angel to b e born in a new world. These angels initially had a new heart and mind that could only perceive the knowledge of good without t he evil knowledge. In contrast, everyone in this recalled world of sin has experienced the good things (health, food, love , friendship, etc.) with the evil things.

Those spirits in angels who did n ot rebel on two thirds of the planets in heaven will be the sam e spirits on this recalled Earth who accept this new doctrine.

Out of that darkness came forth a revelation when God’s Glory o f lightning illuminated the Earth. Light dissipates darkness a nd illuminates the mysterious things that are hidden in the night. In the beginning, Elohiym said “Let there be light” (see Genesis 1:3 ). The Earth that was covered in water and darkness be came visible, as lightning revealed the Earth’s hidden s ecrets. All things of this recalled Earth were made naked by th e light of truth unveiling the covering of darkness. Thereaft er, the covering of water was also unveiled to expose the h idden things beneath it. Darkness (evening) was first exposed b y the light of lightning (morning). Accordingly, the evening exis ted before the morning (see Genesis 1:5 ). This darkness, which covered the Earth, was as blotted-out thoughts in God’s min d. These thoughts pertained to the Earth’s past creation pri or to Adam and Eve of Genesis being created. From the lightning o f God’s Glory (Holy Spirit) was made known the hidden thing s of the first creation. The Earth where we dwell was once inhabited pr ior to the creation of Adam and Eve of Genesis. The first wor ld had been destroyed in a lake of lava and, thereafter, covere d in the sea of water in Genesis 1:2 . Many of the laws and morals of the first creation were perceived to be evil.

Th erefore, darkness came before light. This reveals that evil (darkness) came before good (light). The first creation, whic h existed prior to Adam and Eve of this recalled Earth and before t he worlds of the angels, was condemned as evil. Out of evil (da rkness, evening) was born good (light, morning). In many i nstances, darkness symbolizes evil because many evils are com mitted in the evening (literal darkness) or in secret (spirit ual darkness). Light, in most instances, symbolizes good because l ight (truth) reveals the evil (abomination) that was done in the evening (darkness) and in secret. Thick darkness conceals evil until light unveils (makes known) the hidden/secret things of t he night. The knowledge of good and evil was contained i n the fruit of the tree of good and evil. This knowledge of evil was originally understood and acquired from the first creation, be fore the recreation of Adam and Eve of Genesis, and before t he new worlds of the angels existed. When Adam and Eve of Genesis partook of the forbidden fruit – containing the kno wledge of good and evil – their eyes were opened. Eating the fruit made them instantly aware of many things, including the knowledge of nakedness and shame. The knowledge of nakedness an d shame was of the first creation, where all manner of sin was committed. We experience the same evils in this world. Adam a nd Eve of Genesis inherited all the evils of the first creati on when they partook of the fruit that contained the hidden know ledge of good and evil. Thereby, Adam and Eve genetically passed the knowledge of good and evil to their offspring after partaking of the forbidden fruit.

A comet will hit the nation of the U.S.A. as it did in the first timelin e. The people of this rebellious nation claim to be part of God’s bl essed people. Yet, they have rejected, persecuted, and killed the first latter-day Man Child (Elijah-type) and many people of his chur ch at Mt. Carmel in Waco, Texas. After the impact of a great star/comet – which causes a massive earthquake – the third (fina l) latter-day group of redeemed will, thereafter, be gathered fro m all remaining nations during a time of trouble (comet’s plagues). All generations of our world were repeated aft er the first timeline. Thereby, God knew what will take place i n every generation. Accordingly, God has already seen and recorded every event that has happened. Elohiym declared to the people living in the first and subsequent generations, dur ing a replay of those generations, how this world would end. God h as already seen the things that happened in this recalled worl d’s first track of time. During the many replays of our generation , the two anointed messengers change the course of many peopl e’s lives when they interact with them according to their div inely appointed ministry. There are those hard-headed in dividuals who will always rebel against this new doctrine. T hese rebellious people maintain the same rebellious cour se in life in every rerun of this last generation prior to their destruction by a comet’s plagues. The people who accept this new do ctrine will alter their former path in life, as they walk accor ding to the revelation of the seventh angel’s seven small visio ns and seven thunders. These wise saints will escape a terrible time of trouble, which begins with a comet’s impact. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 The End Revealed at the Beginning In the beginning of time, a light came on in the un iversal mind of God. This light was the beginning of creation, fro m which everything developed. The solar system where this Earth is located was the first place to attain order from th e chaos of the cosmos. Out of the fiery Earth came water. Lightn ing striking the waters caused an atmosphere to materialize betw een the waters upon the Earth from the water-vapors around the Earth’s firmament. When the waters were divided, land had been unveiled. The seas were gathered in one place and one land mass became visible. Within the universal mind/spi rit of Elohiym, a sun, moons, and planets were arranged in the Earth’s solar system. Upon Earth, the first world would ma ture to bring forth life, according to the masculine and feminine image of Elohiym. Mankind was the last creature to evolve, having the greatest intellect over all life of the first creat ion. After the first creation on Earth came to an e nd, twelve new worlds were recreated in this solar system with onl y the good things that existed in the first creation on Earth. On each of these worlds, two perfect humans (first Adam and fi rst Eve) were created. These evening and morning stars (Luc ifers) gave birth to angels (perfect humans), who once inhabite d the old world of this Earth. The humans of Earth’s first c reation had a heart and mind that practiced the laws of evil (pri de, greed, lust, envy, deceit, hatred, anger, etc.). These evil law s were not at first recognized to be evil. Only after Elohiym ex perienced – through its first creation – evil in comparison to good did God declare pride, greed, lust, envy, deceit, hatred an d anger to be evil. From the evil ways of animals and people liv ing in the Earth’s first world, Elohiym had acquired the knowl edge and understanding of what laws would work harmoniously. Therefore, out of evil (darkness, evening) came goo d (light, morning). The first creation was destroyed by a co met, which was the instrument that naturally brought an end to the old; thereafter, twelve new worlds in this solar system were made for angels to dwell thereon. These new worlds of the a ngels only incorporated the good things that were perceived af ter experiencing the evil of the first creation. All things in the universe are created in the mind of Elohiym."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 Therefore, God blotted out of its mind the whole fi rst creation when it was destroyed by the impact of a meteorite. This event released the plagues of a bottomless pit of magma, which consumed the first world in a lake of fiery lava. The impact of a huge comet on this Earth opened a huge volcano, as dust, smoke, and ash exploded into the air darkening the sky. T hereafter, lava flowed out of this huge volcano to engulf the whole world in a sea of lava. After the destruction of Earth’s first creatio n in this solar system, Elohiym consecutively created each of twelv e inhabited worlds – beginning with Earth – upon a figurative s ea of glass with their moons. Each of these newly created plan ets had an Eden within it – which was planted by the words of Melchizedek and Shekinah – for the new Adam and new Eve to dwel l therein. These new Adams and new Eves were created as perfec t humans/angels, who only knew good as they dwelt in their perfect garden in a completely natural way. All th eir offspring were born as male and female twins, who were as one person in two bodies, perfect mates. These perfect humans – who were born in their new worlds – are referred to as the a ngels, who once dwelt as imperfect humans in the first creatio n that was destroyed and remade. Angels had no knowledge concerning their forme r lives as imperfect humans in the first world that was destro yed. In fact, they had no idea that a first creation existed.

These Lucifers with their offspring (angels) subtly rebelled. Earth’s Recreation 3a] Elohiym recalled the evil ways of the Earth’s p ast creation, which was concealed in the universal mind of God. The former ways of Earth’s first world were figuratively hidde n beneath a sphere made of a gemstone foundation/sea of glass. 3b] The glorious lightning of God illuminated the d arkness that veiled the first destroyed world on Earth (see Genesis 1:3 ). This light represented the memory of God pertaining to t he former ways of the first creation. These evil ways were r ecalled in Genesis at the beginning of the angels’ world. 3c] Elohiym separates the waters of Genesis 1:2 by placing water-vapors around the firmament (heaven) of the E arth (see Genesis 1:6-8 ). This illustrates how the new world of the angel s was, as it were, built upon a sea of glass/gemstone foundation, which was figuratively around the former Earth’s at mosphere. 3d] Elohiym recalls all plant life back upon Earth as it once was in the angels’ world (see Genesis 1:11, 12 ). The sun, moon, and stars are also recalled (see Genesis 1:14 , 17 ). All sea life and all animal life are recalled upon Earth as they were in the angels’ worlds (see Genesis 1:20-25 ). 3e] Elohiym (Melchizedek and Shekinah) created Adam and Eve in their image. Adam and Eve of Genesis had a hear t and mind that were of the first two angels (rebellious Lucif ers) who dwelt on one third of the angels’ planets. They were com manded to replenish/refill this recalled Earth with people as it once was (see Genesis 1:26, 28 ). 3f] From the time of the recreation of Adam and Eve of Genesis until the last generation of our recalled world, al l generations are played many times over (see Ecclesiastes 1:9, 10; 3:15 ). 3g] There are at least two anointed messengers born in every"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 generation who have the mind (spirit) of the righte ous Adams and Eves.

To cover the shame (sin) of Adam and Eve, Melchizedek and Shekinah – in the single form of Me tatron – made coats of skins so their nakedness would be cov ered. Elohiym used the skins of animals that were sacrifi ced on Adam and Eve’s behalf (see Genesis 3:21 ). The two animals that Metatron sacrificed to cover the sins of Adam and E ve were a sign of the latter-day Kid Goat and Lamb of God, wh ose ministries are sacrificed for the lost sinner. The blood of the two written witnesses atones for the lost sinner, so th eir sins pertaining to their erroneous beliefs may be blotte d-out (covered), as symbolized by the sacrifice of an Eve n-Kid Goat and morning Lamb. The clothing of skins, which covered the naked ness (sin) of Adam and Eve, was an example to them of what God ex pected as offerings for their sins. There was a day when Cain brought an offering to God from the fruit of the ground. A bel also brought his offering, which was a firstling (firstb orn) of his flock of sheep. The Lord had respect unto Abel’s offerin g, but unto Cain’s offering the Lord had no respect. Cain was not wise in offering the fruit of the ground. Forgiveness of m an’s erroneous beliefs and ways was foreshadowed by the atoning bl ood of sacrificed animals, which pointed to the ministries of two anointed messengers of God. Their ministries are sa crificed to cleanse the mind of sinners. This is the reason wh y Elohiym could not accept Cain’s offering, as stated in Genesis 4:3-5 . The flood in the days of Noah happened at a ti me when the daughters of Cain were taken for wives by the sons of Seth (sons of God). Thereby, the sons of Seth (sons of God) b rought forth children (seed) who had the mind of Cain (see Genesis 6:1-6 ). The generations that followed – because the sons of Seth took wives of the daughters of Cain – were generations t hat forgot the ways of the Lord’s offerings. Therefore, it disple ased the Lord because of certain-minded people living on Earth (s ee Genesis"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 6:6 ). The Earth was full of wickedness in departing f rom the Lord’s ways. God chose Noah to build an ark and ga ther into the ark animals and people who would heed Noah’s me ssage. All the Earth was about to be covered by a flood of waters (see Genesis 7:1-4 ). After a flood destroyed all life upon the land , the waters drained into seas from the face of some of the land . God blessed Noah and his sons, as they went forth from the ark and became fruitful and multiplied, replenishing the Earth wit h people (see Genesis 8:16, 17 ; 9:1 ). At that time, it was Noah with whom God had chosen to establish an agreement (see Genesis 6:18 ). When Noah exited the ark, he immediately built an a ltar unto the Lord and offered from every clean beast and every c lean fowl an offering to Elohiym. Hayah Havah smelled a sweet s avor and vowed that the Earth would not be destroyed by a fl ood of water (see Genesis 8:20-22 ). Noah pleased God when he reinstated the sacrificial services that atoned for the sins (beli efs and ways) of man. Thereafter, God established an agreement with Noah (see Genesis 9:11-17 ). The Lord called Abraham out of Ur of the Chald ees to make Abraham’s seed inherit the Promised Land (see Genesis 12:1-3, 7 ). God established an agreement with Abraham (see Genesis 17:2-7 ). Abraham was told to offer up his son Isaac as a sacrifice in Genesis 22:2 . God was testing Abraham’s faith. As Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac, God commanded Abraham to stop the sacrifice; Abraham obediently c omplied. Instead of Isaac, God provided Abraham with a ram t o slay upon the altar (see Genesis 22:13 ). This ram foreshadowed the anointed messenger who would reveal his doctrine to fulfill the types (shadows) that pertained to the slaying of ce rtain clean animals. The ultimate sacrifice was that Elohiym would send the spirit of their own son (Kid Goat) and daughter (Lamb), wh ose ministries would be slain in the place of sinners. All sacrifices of clean and unblemished animals pertained to the s croll’s record of each generation, which faithfully – without blem ish – records the events that take place on Earth. God made agre ements with the seed of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and through Jaco b’s twelve sons. From the seed (children) of the twelve sons of Jacob came the twelve tribes of Israel. Through these tribes , God established many agreements. These twelve tribes o f Israel were"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 57 to keep the many agreements of God so that they wou ld be a peculiar people in the midst of many nations (see Exodus 19:5, 6 ). In the past, God required the slaying of sacri ficial animals, sanctuary services, including the keeping of feast days, new moons, and Sabbaths. These rituals foreshadowed ea ch scroll’s record, which recorded the events taking place duri ng the manifestation of the two anointed messiahs in every generation. These messengers reveal who they are according to t heir predictions, which are based on the scroll’s record pertaining to their generation. In them is the confirmation of a ll the agreements (covenants) that God made with the peopl e. John the Baptist and Yahshua (Jesus) were the two anointed messiahs who manifested in the generation of 2,000 years ago. Their ministries atoned for the sins of the people who accepted their covenant. The first covenant of that generat ion was revealed by John the Baptist. All who heeded to hi s doctrine, and had done according to his words, were under the rod of his covenant. When Yahshua began his ministry, the peo ple who accepted John the Baptist’s covenant and were still alive when Yahshua began his ministry had to accept Yahshua’s covenant to be saved from their sins – previous beliefs and way s. This meant that those who rejected the second covenant o f Yahshua’s doctrine were no longer covered by the sacrifice of John the Baptist’s (first witness’) ministry or by the sacri fice of Yahshua’s (second witness’) ministry. The ministries of John the Baptist and Yahshua died for the people who accepted their covenant in their generat ion only. There were many almost simultaneous replays of Yahs hua’s generation; during which, John the Baptist and Yahs hua gathered many apostles in small groups. Every righteous spi rit of these apostles is also in the mind of a person who believ es the latter- day Chosen Vessel. Thereby, they will also be writ ten in the last scroll/scroll of life that records this last genera tion. Everything that pertained to John the Baptist’s ministry (in w hom was the duplicate spirit of Gabriel), Yahshua’s ministry (i n whom was the duplicate spirit of Michael), past resurrection , and the old day of Pentecost are symbolic examples of the final min istry of latter-day John the Baptist and latter-day Yahshua.

In the first messenger’s mind, who manifested in our generation, was the duplicate spirit of Michael. Within the mind of th e latter-day second witness (living messiah) is the duplicate sp irit of Gabriel. The first witness of this last generation was David Koresh (typified by John the Baptist), and the second witn ess is the Chosen Vessel (typified by Yahshua). All the saint s who were gathered in all past generations by two messengers are again born in this last generation to be gathered by the last two messengers. The names of these saints will be writ ten in the scroll of life as inheriting the new Earth. The slaying of animals, including all temple s ervices, was literally performed so the people dwelling in the l ast generation of the Christian era could understand their meaning . Those who lived in pre-Christian times literally fulfilled th e sacrificial laws and ordinances, which Moses gave unto them as instr ucted by God. An ordinance stated that if a person ate any unclean animal, they were eating an abomination. Today, th is past ordinance refers to a person who believes in any ot her unclean belief that is not revealed by the living anointed. Every non- believer of present truth is spiritually eating an abomination (unclean food). The offering of an unclean sacrifi ce in the literal temple caused that temple to be defiled. This is e quated to a person who worships another belief in their mind (b eing their spiritual temple), which is contrary to the scroll of life’s predictions. This last script is revealed by the l atter-day living anointed (morning Lamb) before a comet hits the lan d. A sacrifice of a Kid Goat – representing dawni ng moonlight – foreshadowed the sacrifice of the first witness’ mi nistry for the sins (false beliefs and ways) that were committed b y people living in his generation. The first witness was th e forerunner to the second witness; hence, the second witness’ mini stry is symbolized by the sacrifice of a morning Lamb. The morning (Sun of Righteousness) Lamb revealed his covenant t o the people of the same generation who were given the fi rst covenant by the first witness. For instance, Aaron and Mose s were the Even-Kid Goat and morning Lamb for their generation ; as were Abraham and Lot, Isaac and Jacob, Joshua and Eleaza r, David and Solomon, Elijah and Elisha, John the Baptist an d Yahshua.

Adam came befor e Eve, just as the bright light of the evening star (moon/first wi tness) was recalled in Genesis before the morning sunrise (mor ning star/second witness). In Exodus 17:3, the people who came out of Israel thirsted for water. Moses (type of the Chosen Vessel) was told to take his rod and smite the rock/mountain (see Exodus 17:6 ). The initial scenario of Moses smiting the rock, as God commande d him, was repeated after the Israelites failed to take th e Promised Land (see Numbers 20:8 ). Moses was told to take his rod and ask the rock for water. Moses obediently gathered the peop le before the rock and then smote it twice (see Numbers 20:11 ). The smiting of the rock twice is symbolic of the two latter-day covenants that are lying dead after each of two spiritual wilderne ss journeys. As the one rock was cleaved in two parts, whereby w ater came out of it, so the seventh angel’s (little scroll’s) message is simultaneously divided (revealed) by the illuminate d moon (first witness) and the duplicate sun (second witness) dur ing each spiritual wilderness journey in Revelation 12:6, 14 . Spiritual waters (words) of new truth rained down to create a river of life when the seventh angel’s seven thunders had sounded . This could only take place when latter-day Moses’ (Chose n Vessel’s) duplicate sun’s light (rod) illuminated the moon. Moses sinned in Numbers 20:10 . Moses and Aaron “doubted” that water would come from the rock (moun t) when they said “...must we (Moses and Aaron) fetch you wat er out of this rock?” Therefore, because God was not glorifi ed before the faces of the Israelite people, in that Moses doubte d that the mount/rock would give water, the Lord did not allow Moses and Aaron to enter into the Promised Land with the matu red children of Israel (see Numbers 20:12 ). Nowhere does it state that God was angry with Moses for smiting the rock. On the contrary, God expected Moses to smite the rock as he did in Exodus 17:6 . The Apostle Paul said in Hebrews 9:14 that the offering of Christ’s body – which died and resurrected accordin g to prophecy – made Christ the mediator of a new covenant/testament (see Hebrews 9:15 ). Christ’s death cleansed (atoned) the sins (transgressions) that were commit ted during his covenant only. He was the redeemer of the people w ho believed in him in the apostles’ generation, which they thou ght was the end times ( 1 Timothy 4:1; 1 Peter 1:20 ). Accordingly, the blood"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 60 of Christ, 2,000 years ago, could only atone for th e sins of the people who lived in his generation. Thereafter, he was referred to as a mediator until the manifestation of the lat ter-day two messengers in this last generation. The two latter-day anointed messengers have th e spirit of Michael and Gabriel dwelling in their minds, just l ike each pair of messengers who manifest in every generation. In the New Testament era, a messenger (witness) always manifes ted from the last church (woman) that believed in the previo us living anointed messenger. The first messenger of our gen eration was David Koresh, who came out (hence, he was spiritual ly born as the first latter-day Man Child) from the church (wo man) who believed in the words of the former living anointed (see Deuteronomy 18:18 ). David Koresh was born according to the prophecies in Psalm 40:7 , 12 ; 51:4 . Yahshua (Jesus) of 2,000 years ago started a p remeditated violent fight using a whip (string of chords) withi n the courtyard of Jerusalem’s temple around the time of Passover. He also called people fools (see Luke 11:40 ) while condemning a person who should call someone a fool (see Matthew 5:22 ). When Yahshua required a costly foal of an ass, he had hi s disciples deceitfully claim that the owner needed it (see Matthew 21:1-3 ). It is not stealing, since Yahshua knew everything ( including people) belonged to him. Therefore, unless a perso n is convinced in their mind of committing a sin, he or she is, as it were, without sin (see John 8:46 ). Yahshua employed deception to test his many di sciples. He wanted to see who would be at least willing to drin k his blood and eat his flesh (see John 6:48-58 ). Even though Yahshua was testing his many alleged followers, he sounded dead serious in regards to them eating his flesh and drinking his b lood (see John 6:60-66 ). Almost every Christian of today would have for saken Yahshua had they lived in his day, just as many of his professed disciples did (see John 6:66 ). Yahshua gained a bad reputation for being an excessive eater of flesh, excessive dr inker of alcoholic wine, and hanging around places of ill re pute (see Matthew 11:19 ). However, these traits were divinely orchestrated to show the contrast between John the Baptist’s weaker ministry and Yahshua’s more potent ministry. It is understandable that a man such as Yahshu a, who was"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 61 rejected by just about every person of his nation ( hence, an acquaintance of sorrow and grief), would get drunk from time to time ( Proverbs 31:6 ). Yahshua came to divide those who believed his doctrine from those who rejected it (s ee Matthew 10:34-39 ). Near the end of Yahshua’s ministry, his earlie r idea of turning the other cheek was altered. Therefore, he command ed his disciples to sell, if necessary, their garment to a cquire a sword (see Luke 22:35, 36 ). Yahshua was expecting an imminent showdown with the authorities of the day, as stated in Luke 22:37 . Therefore, when Yahshua knew his time had come, he wanted to know how many swords his disciples had ga thered (see Luke 22:38 ). As the evening of the Passover’s preparation day was at hand, the disciples had only two swords among them. Yahshua’s hopes of making a stand with swords were dashed. It crossed Yahshua’s mind that he may die in a sword b attle with the rebellious authorities. Still, he knew he had done nothing for which the authorities could condemn him to receive the death sentence. Though Yahshua knew he was going to be killed, how he was going to be killed was not immediately clear to him . That is until the Sanhedrin, residing as the judicial court of the people, began to try him. When a legal arrest warrant was issued to take Yahshua to jail by force to be tried for violating the law, his faithful apostles were ready to fight for him (see Luke 22:49 ). Although his apostles were willing and ready for ba ttle, Yahshua quickly made a way of escape for his apostles, who fled when Yahshua reasoned with his captors to take him only. However, Yahshua perceived that another outcome lay ahead fo r his demise. Mere fishermen, a tax collector, and other apostles displayed great valor, ready to slay for the carpen ter, whom the leaders and people believed had done miracles on th e Sabbath through Beelzebub (see Matthew 9:34 ). Yahshua told Pontius Pilate that if it were ti me for his kingdom to be established on Earth, he would have l et his followers fight for him (see John 18:36 ). Today, many Christians are called but few have what it takes – see the apostles’ attitude as an example – to be chosen. The messiah of 2,000 years ago stated unto his apostles that he had many things that he would like to tell them, but they could not bare them (see John 16:12 ). These things Christ"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 wanted to tell his apostles were the things that re lated to his spirit manifesting again in human form to fulfill s cripture in every New Testament generation (see Acts 1:10, 11 ). Yahshua and John the Baptist quickly manifested through two people in the Christian churches (see Revelation 22:12 ). Also, among the apostles were at least two people who had the same spirit in their mind as was in the mind of John the Baptist and Yah shua. These two were prominent in the establishment of the seve n churches in Asia Minor. After the apostles were all dead, another two messengers materialized from among the members of the seven ch urches. When the first witness began to prophesy of his new doctrine – which is the covenant for his generation – it cause d a division among the church. Among the people who accepted th e new covenant of the first witness is the second witness . The second witness does not reveal his doctrine until the curr ent witness (messenger) dies. Then the second messenger will re veal his or her doctrine to the church of the previous messenge r. However, the new doctrine of the second witnes s is a new (second) covenant, which causes a division among th e church that still holds fast to the first covenant. This scenario plays out during every generation. For instance, in the New Testament period, each anointed messenger who manifested in e very generation from the church of the previous witness fulfilled the predictions in the scroll of their generation. Dur ing the last generation, the two messengers fulfill the propheci es that are written on the scroll of life’s first side. In thi s last generation, David Koresh (first witness) was fulfilling his min istry until his death. Now, the Chosen Vessel (second witness) pro phesies of the end of this first world and the beginning of a new Earth to the people who are living in this last generation. We are living in the last generation that will see the effects of a comet’s impact. The last book of the Bible is the apocalypse o f latter-day Jesus Christ (second witness). First, latter-day J ohn the Baptist came as the Elijah-type messenger. This first witn ess manifested in this last generation having a new name, which he (Elijah-type) revealed to his followers. Latter-day Elijah’s new name in this generation was David Koresh.

The record of all events, which take place i n this last generation, are written on the scroll of life. Thi s scroll of life’s record will be rolled-up and sealed closed until af ter the biblical millennium. While the scroll of life in Revelation 5:1 is rolled-up and sealed, its knowledge is as the contents within the concealed ark of the covenant. After the biblical millennium, th e morning Lamb manifests to take the scroll of life to reveal its record. This parallels the Chosen Vessel on Earth revealing the hidden words (manna) within the rolled-up scroll of life. Prior to the comet’s impact, the scroll of life’s seventh angel’ s predictions are revealed. This seventh angel’s revealed words (grains) are equated with unleavened showbread and cakes, which resemble white stones (see Revelation 2:17 ). During the biblically prophesied millennium, every other scroll, which re corded every past generation’s events, is revealed during the ju dgment of everyone’s past lifetime (see Daniel 7:9, 10 ). After the Elijah-type messenger manifested in our generation as the first latter-day Man Child, he was killed wi th some of his followers. From this first Man Child’s remaining f ollowers (church) manifested the Chosen Vessel. The Chosen Vessel then revealed that he had a new covenant according to th e record of the scroll of life, which the Chosen Vessel began t o reveal from the scroll of life’s first evening-side. This proc lamation by the second Man Child (latter-day Moses/Elisha/Yahshua) caused a division among the remaining followers of David Kor esh. The remaining faithful people, who were gathered by Dav id Koresh, and others of Christendom believed the new second c ovenant. This new covenant was initially given to them by th e Chosen Vessel during the remaining 1260 days of the first 2300-day period (these 2300 days began on April 15, 1993) wh ile in spiritual Goshen.

The second witness feeds the sheep, who are of the living God’ s fold, with his shepherd’s rod, which blossoms with fruit (see Ezekiel 7:10 ; Jeremiah 1:11 ; Micah 7:14 ).

The Elijah (Aaron-type) and Elisha (Moses-type ) of the past had the power of God’s word to prevent literal rain from falling upon the land, and they had the power to cause fire to descend from heaven.

Whe n the seventh angel gave the scroll of life to the morning Lamb ( see Revelation 5:1 ), it is likened to latter-day Elijah giving his sc roll of life to the Chosen Vessel (latter-day Elisha). The Chosen Vessel was a follower of the first latter-day Man Child, as para lleled by the apostle, John the Revelator, who followed Yahshua. In other worlds, as the Even-Kid Goat (Elijah-type messenger ) of our day revealed his ministry before the Chosen Vessel, it parallels old Elijah anointing Elisha (see 1 Kings 19:16 ) and passing his mantle to Elisha. The latter-day living messenger (morning Lamb) , who received the scroll of life, is typified by Elisha of old. Elisha received a double portion of Elijah’s spirit. This means that the latter-day Chosen Vessel has a double portion of la tter-day Elijah’s spirit; therefore, he (Elisha) possesses t he moon’s and duplicate sun’s revelation of what is written on th e scroll of life’s first side.

The faithful woman (initial church members) and her offspring (144,000) are fed and no urished with the seventh angel’s revealed words.

Duri ng the spiritual journey from spiritual Goshen to the other side of the spiritual Red Sea, the Chosen Vessel (latter-day Moses) was r evealing six of seven angels from the unrolled scroll of life’s seventh part (see Revelation 8:1, 2 ).

The two witne sses are referred to as two olive trees and two candlesticks , which simultaneously reveal the seventh angel’s seven sma ll visions and seven thunders.

The revelation of the scroll of life’s seventh angel has caused the beliefs within the nations (rivers/waters) of C hristendom to become unclean. Accordingly, the spiritual waters of Christendom are spiritually poisoned, as if they we re waters of blood (death). However, the people who remain in t heir nation (river) after the new truth has sounded its trumpet warnings to them will be slain when their nation (river) is lit erally made into blood (death) by a comet’s impact.

When the scroll of life’s prophecies are being revealed according to the moon’s light, the moon is personif ied by Melchizedek who manifested as the first anointed wi tness. When Metatron manifested in the middle of the mercy seat, its masculine form was represented by the right hand co vering cherub, who was equated with Melchizedek. The tree of life on the right side of the river in Revelation 22:2 and the Holy One who stood on the right side of the waters in Daniel 12:5 represent the image of Melchizedek. This is in acc ordance with the moon’s revelation of the first masculine-side o f the scroll of life. Shekinah Shekinah is the personification of the feminine par t of Elohiym (Metatron). The light of lightning that illuminate d the first morning of the first day of Genesis, including the other mornings, represents Shekinah. She is equated with the things that were recalled in the initial six mornings of G enesis. Her words were spoken to the prophets, who wrote them i n their scrolls. It was Shekinah, with Melchizedek, who sp oke to Moses from the burning bush (tree). Her spirit is in the mind of the"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 second anointed witness. Likewise, his mind is in the church that accepted his revelation of the scroll of life. Shekinah is the feminine Holy Spirit who manif ests on the mercy seat as the left hand covering cherub. Melch izedek and Shekinah are as Metatron when the moon’s (Melchized ek’s) and duplicate sun’s (Shekinah’s spirit) record are mixi ng together on each part of the seventh angel. When the Chosen Ve ssel is revealing the scroll of life’s first side, the spir it of Shekinah has manifested within the mind of the Chosen Vessel (se cond witness). At that time, Shekinah is represented by the tree of life on the left side of the river in Revelation 22:2 and by the Holy One who stood on the left side of the waters in Daniel 12:5 . Adam and Eve The first Adam in our recalled world was made in th e image of the masculine Melchizedek-part of Elohiym, just as Eve was the image of the feminine Shekinah-part of Elohiym. Ad am and Eve of Genesis had the same spirit as the rebellious Ad ams and Eves who dwelt on a rebellious third of the stars/planet s in heaven (see Revelation 12:4 ). After certain angels’ subtle rebellion in heav en (sea of glass), this past world where we dwell was recalled back to existence below the figurative sea of glass. All the rebelli ous angels can now be revealed in this world, where the ability to do good and evil is possible. The other righteous Adams and Ev es, who dwelt on two thirds of the twelve stars/planets (of Revelation 12:1 ) in the future of this solar system, did not rebel in the first heaven. In these righteous Adams was the spirit of Michael, and in the righteous Eves was the spirit of Gabriel. T hey are the image of Melchizedek and Shekinah, who are born as the two witnesses in every generation to gather their redee med (righteous angels). John the Baptist and Yahshua John the Baptist was the first witness of his gener ation.

After he finished his ministry, according to that scroll’s first side, th e second witness of that same generation began his ministry to fulfi ll the unfinished prophecies according to the same scroll’ s first side. Yahshua (Jesus) was the second witness of his generation, who had the duplicate spirit of Michael dwelling in his mind. John the Baptist and Yahshua were the two anointed messengers in their day, who were the written words of a scrol l made flesh for their generation. In every generation, there i s a two-sided scroll’s first side that pertains to two masculine witnesses who materialize to reveal their message to the people l iving in their day. Accordingly, the ministry of the first mascul ine witness is written on a scroll’s first side, while the ministr y of the second masculine witness is also written on the same first side pertaining to that same generation. When the first witness – whose ministry is wri tten on the scroll’s first side – begins fulfilling the prophec ies that are written on the scroll’s first side, then Melchizede k (personifying the moon’s light that reveals the scroll’s first si de) has manifested as the first anointed messenger. Therea fter, when the second witness begins revealing and fulfilling the unfulfilled prophecies on the scroll’s first side, then the min d of Shekinah (personifying the duplicate sun’s light that reveal s the scroll’s first side) has materialized in the mind of the sec ond anointed messenger. Every generation’s events are recorded on a scroll, which makeup the scrolls/books of Daniel 7:10 and Revelation 20:12 . Appropriately, the events that take place in thi s last generation and the initial 1,000 years of a new Ear th are written on the last scroll/scroll of life (see Revelation 20:12 ). First Man Child and Chosen Vessel The first Man Child of our generation was David Kor esh. He attempted to reveal and fulfill the last scroll’s/s croll of life’s first side, just as old King David thought that he would build God’s temple in old Jerusalem. In the mind of David Kore sh dwelt the duplicate spirit of Michael. This first latter-day Man Child was the scroll of life’s first side made flesh.

At that same time, his ministry began to be written on the scroll of life’s first side. Within the mind o f the Chosen Vessel dwells the duplicate spirit of Gabriel. The two latter-day messengers have manifested as a thief (unexpectedly) in the night to reveal their doctrin e before the great and dreadful day of the great star (Abaddon) hits the Earth. The plagues that are attributed to God’s (seventh a ngel’s) wrath are fulfilled in this last generation when the mete orite releases its armies of destruction from an opened bottomless pit (immense volcano). Every Eye Shall See Them The final manifestation of the first witness (spiri t of Michael) and the second witness (spirit of Gabriel) takes pl ace when the prophecy of a comet’s impact has been fulfilled. A t that time, every eye will see the affects of the great star (m eteorite). Latter-day Babylon’s (confusion’s) final 43-month ( 1293-½-day) reign will end when the great star (comet), which i s personified by the two witnesses, strikes the U.S.A.

Its impact will open a huge volcano’s mouth, wh ich reaches down through the Earth’s mantle to the magm a of hell. For five months, smoke and hot ash will erupt from this immense orifice, as many other volcanoes are also a wakened. Dust, smoke and debris will darken the sky over the U.S.A.

For 3-½ days his dead body lay in a tomb. At the end of th ese 3-½ days, a bright angel came down from heaven. In our day, this angel personifies the falling star of Revelation 9:1 , which symbolizes a great shining comet impacting the Earth (see Zechariah 14:4 ). Before that time, the Chosen Vessel will prophesy a gain for a period of 1263-½ days (these 1263-½ days are mentio ned in Revelation 12:14 ). During that time, all the 144,000 will be ripened with this new doctrine, which is likened to spiritual rain and sunlight. When 1260 days (three and a half yea rs of Revelation 11:3 ) have expired, then 3-½ days later – which are the remaining 3-½ days of Revelation 12:14 – the great star/meteorite in Revelation 9:1 will impact the Earth, causing the massive earthquake of Revelation 6:12; 11:3 . The earthquake, which is caused by the meteori te’s impact, parallels the past type where the angel who came do wn from heaven caused an earthquake when its feet touched t he ground (see Matthew 28:2 ). This past earthquake, which was caused by the descended angel, signaled that the resurrection of the martyrs in Yahshua’s generation had taken place (see Matthew 27:51, 52; 28:2 ). This typifies the resurrection that takes place in this last generation when a great star falls to Earth 3- ½ days after the ministry of the second witness has been fulfilled i n Christendom. In Yahshua’s generation, instead of a meteor h itting the land of Palestine, an angel personified it, so this last generation (our day) could be warned of the comet’s impact by viewi ng the figurative past type.

A huge chondrite shall hit the Earth in our generatio n, signaling the resurrection of those who literally or figuratively died with the first Man Child (David Koresh) and Chosen Vessel in this last generation.

The Translation of Elijah Typifies the Translation of Certain Saints in This Last Generation Elijah was the messenger of the Lord who was transl ated without seeing death. A fiery chariot took up Elijah bodil y (see 2 Kings 2:11 ). The ascension of Elijah typifies the translatio n of the living followers of the Chosen Vessel who remain al ive to be translated. Two latter-day groups of redeemed will be gathered from Christendom before the meteor strikes the U.S. A. The woman in Revelation 12:6, 14 represents the initial church members who consist of some of the first Man Child’ s followers, who were not killed with him, and others who were g athered from spiritual Goshen by the Chosen Vessel. These faithful saints are of the first group of redeemed, who repr esent the Chosen Vessel’s initial church members. They were initially fed with the doctrine that is likened to unleavened bar ley cakes, which was made with grains of barley grown in spiri tual Egypt. The spiritual children of the woman (initial c hurch) are the 144,000, who must be ripened, harvested, and sealed in their minds with the new doctrine (leavened wheat bread m ade with manna) before the second spiritual wilderness journ ey of 1263-½ days expires. Both the moon’s light and duplicate sun’s light are revealed by the Chosen Vessel’s new doctrine, which shall prophesy again of the seventh angel during the thir d 2300-day period. Three and a half (3-½) days after these 23 00 days, the second spiritual wilderness journey of 1263-½ days will end, as mentioned in Revelation 11:3, 9; 12:14 . Hence, the woman (initial church) was in spiritual Goshen and fled t o the other side of the spiritual Red Sea to enter the spiritual wil derness. In the past type, the Israelites went from Gos hen to the other side of the Red Sea and then to the wilderness of Z in. Though, the Israelites had to return from Canaan to the wil derness when they did not take possession of the land of Canaan after their first wilderness journey through Zin. At the end of the Israelites’ 40- year journey in the wilderness, the remaining Israe lites and their matured children crossed the River Jordan to enter the Promised Land of Canaan.

Then they shall gather a great multitude of people from all remaining nations with the Holy Spirit’s power. Th ereafter, the great multitude will enter into the glorious light (ensign) of New Jerusalem with the Chosen Vessel’s initial church a nd 144,000 before the Earth is engulfed in a flowing lake of f ire/lava. Therefore, as Elijah was an Israelite who was trans lated without seeing death, so many of the first and second latte r-day groups of redeemed, who are gathered from spiritual Israel (C hristendom) in this last generation of the New Testament era, w ill also be translated without having to be resurrected to ente r the fiery ensign. The Ascension of Enoch Typifies the Translation of the Great Multitude Enoch, who was considered the seventh from Adam, wa lked with God (see Jude 1:14 ). Enoch was translated from this Earth to heaven without experiencing death (see Genesis 5:24 ). The translation of Enoch typifies the third latter-day group of redeemed, which will be translated through the fier y ensign of New Jerusalem without tasting death. Enoch typifie s the great multitude in Revelation 7:9 , which will be gathered out of all remaining nations that are not immediately affected by the comet’s impact. During a terrible time of trouble in this last generation, after a comet hits the U.S.A., a great multitude will be gathered from mainly non-Christian nations. Fif ty (50) days after the meteorite hits the land, the Holy Spirit’ s power will be given to the woman (initial church) and her matured children (144,000). These two latter-day groups of saints w ill have accepted this new doctrine prior to a comet’s impac t.

The barley harvest was commemorated as stated in Leviticus 23:10 , which represents the ripened, harvested, and sealed first latter-day gro up of redeemed.

Accordingly, this second group is gathered in our day before the new Time of Atone ment begins 3-½ days before the comet hits the Earth. The thir d (final) latter- day gathering of redeemed is represented by the fru it harvest, which was commemorated after the old Day of Atoneme nt (see Leviticus 23:27, 39 ). In Leviticus 23:40 , the people waved palm branches during the Feast of Tabernacles to commemo rate the fruit harvest. This parallels the great multitude in Revelation 7:9 who are holding palm leaves in their hand to reveal they are symbolized as the ripened, harvested, and sealed fi nal fruit harvest. The great multitude symbolizes the return of t he spiritual ten lost tribes (which are also represented by spiritua l Ephraim). In the past type, these tribes were taken into captivi ty by the Assyrian. Ephraim lost his identity when the north ern tribes of Israel became a mixed people with the gentiles (see Hosea 8:8 ). Therefore, in our day, the great multitude is of th e gentiles (non- Christian nations) who shall come out from all non- Christian nations during the comet’s plagues (see Revelation 7:9 ). Ephraim in the past type represented all ten tribes because Ephraim was by far the largest tribe of the ten tri bes. These ten tribes occupied the northern kingdom of Palestine b efore they were taken into captivity. During the New Testament period, the Christian s are the alleged people of God, just as the Hebrews were God ’s professed people for much of the Old Testament era. This mea ns that the great multitude, who are to be gathered in our gene ration of the New Testament era, is mainly gathered from non-Chri stian nations, which are the nations of gentiles in the C hristian era. Certain prophecies in the Old Testament scriptures, which state that many people (great multitude) will return to o ld Jerusalem, are to be fulfilled by New Jerusalem (see Isaiah 2:3 ).

A face like a man symbolizes spiritual locust – such as dust, smoke, and hot ash – consuming agriculture. The face of a lion represen ts death by anarchy. Anarchy is caused by plagues released fro m a bottomless pit (volcano) after a comet’s impact. A n ox’s face symbolizes the slaughter of the rebellious through one of the other three faces.

The first of these two wave-loaves symbolizes the peopl e who are spiritually born of the woman (initial church), acc ording to the illuminated moon’s revelation.

This final group represents – according to one type – the retu rn of spiritual Ephraim (see Genesis 48:17-19 ) as the final fruit harvest of Leviticus 23:39 . In a past type, the fruit harvest was commemorated four days after the old Day of Atoneme nt (cleansing of the sanctuary). This means that the great multitude will begin to be ripened 3-½ days after the new Day of Atonement – which is the same day the second spirit ual wilderness journey ends – from the time the comet-i nduced great earthquake of Revelation 6:12 is fulfilled. In Leviticus 23:40 , the people waved palm branches when they commemorat ed the fruit harvest, just as the great multitude in Revelation 7:9 have palms in their hands. Accordingly, the great multi tude is equated with the fruit harvest that is gathered aft er the time of trouble begins, as verified by the commemoration of the fruit harvest after the old Day of Atonement. A great mu ltitude will be ripened for harvesting during the time of great tribulation, as stated in Revelation 7:14 .

The Holy Spirit commands the Apostle John to w rite the things that he has seen while he is on the Isle of Patmos. These things referred to the first visions he was shown i n Revelation, Chapter 1 (see Revelation 1:19 ). John was also told to write the things (visions and oracles) that will have already happened before the biblically prophesied millennium in a pr evious timeline. All the visions that are written from Re velation Chapter 4, until the end of Chapter 22, concern eve nts that will have taken place in this last generation and the in itial 1,000 years during the new Earth.

T he Assyrian fulfilled God’s present word (sword) – which was sp oken by living prophets – upon the hypocritical northern ki ngdom of Israel (see Isaiah 10:5-10 ). God prophesied that the Assyrian would remove the northern tribe of Palestine into c aptivity. However, the city of Jerusalem was spared. God warned Jerusalem, through living prophets such as Jeremiah and Ezekiel, that King Nebuchadnezzar of B abylon would take Jerusalem and her nation (Judah) into ca ptivity if they – the hypocritical nation of Judea – did not s erve Babylon; yet Jerusalem would not, and rebelled against God’s counsel. Therefore, God (scroll’s record of Jeremiah’s gener ation) destroyed the temple and deported the people of Jer usalem by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar’s Babylon (which represe nted the second rod of God).

In this last generation, the rod of God’s (seventh angel’s) anger was initially in the hand of the first latter-day M an Child (Elijah- type). The first Man Child (Cyrus) “was” to rule all nations, beginning with the seven heads of the dragon/beast, but he only wounded the one head (capital of the Great Christia n Nation), according to the scroll of life’s fifth part’s firs t side.

Latter-day Elijah was the first Man Child of this l ast generation. He began revealing his doctrine to the former churc h (woman) from which he came. The former church members who rejected latter-day Elijah and formed their own separate chu rch were of the harlot. These former members were once a faith ful church. However, the people who accepted the living anointe d (David Koresh) became the new faithful church. After the first latter-day Man Child was kille d on April 19, 1993, the Chosen Vessel manifested from among the f irst Man Child’s church to unseal and reveal the scroll of l ife’s first side. From that time, the Chosen Vessel’s ministry was be ing recorded on the scroll of life’s first side.

Isaiah 2:12 For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every o ne that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low: 2:13 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are h igh and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, 2:14 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up, 2:15 And upon every high tower, and upon every fenc ed wall, 2:16 And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon a ll pleasant pictures. 2:17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. 2:18 And the idols he shall utterly abolish. 2:19 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for t he glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

All the loftiness (high looks) of man will be brought even (level) with the ground.

A great star (meteor) will impact the U.S.A., surprising the hypocrites who had rejected the seven-trumpet sound ing warnings of latter-day Elisha. The revelation of t he seventh angel’s little scroll is the last warning given to Christian nations in this last generation before a comet hits the U.S .A. All nations of Christendom are likened to peop le who sacrificed in strange gardens (cities) upon altars of brick (man- made), instead of God’s altars of stone (see Isaiah 65:3 ). These rebellious nations have defiled themselves with the ir beliefs, which are today an abomination unto the living God (seventh angel). The living anointed, at this time, nourish es his initial church and her spiritual children with the duplicat e sun’s and illuminated moon’s lights, which reveal the seventh angel’s message, as figuratively stated in Isaiah 7:21 . When a nation of Christendom rejects this new doctrine of seven trum pets and instead believes another doctrine of mingled wine ( see Revelation 17:2 ), it is likened to them eating an abomination – spiritual unclean food like swine’s flesh and the m ouse (see Isaiah 65:4 ). The nations of Christendom profess to believe in Christ, yet they will not accept the knowledge of the little sc roll (seventh angel’s message). Many of the wicked have outright rejected the seventh angel’s predictions, because the wicked hav e a judgmental attitude of thinking they are holier tha n the morning Lamb (Chosen Vessel), whose latter-day ministry typ ifies Yahshua’s ministry ( Isaiah 65:5 ). The foolish Christian nations (tribes) are in the Laodicean condition. In other words, they think they are inc reased with goods and have need of nothing, yet they know not t hat they are wretched, poor, miserable, blind, and naked (see Revelation 3:14-19 ). Therefore, the great and dreadful day will surp rise all who have not the seal (mark) of this new doctrine i n their foreheads (minds).

Many in Christendom are not supporting the revelati on of the seventh angel’s seven small visions and seven thund ers. These people will realize very soon that all their treasu res and idols, which they have accumulated, will be worthless to t hem on the great and dreadful day of the comet’s wrath. The r ighteous who purchased with their old beliefs the seventh angel’ s revealed words (hidden manna) will be truly rich with life i n the day of the comet’s earthquake-induced impact. If a person is supporting any other ministry or message other than the seventh angel’s predictions, which is given from the hand o f the living Chosen Vessel and his initial church members at thi s time, he or she is forwarding and supporting an abomination (un clean belief). When a person quotes Yahshua’s/Jesus’ dat ed words or the old words of Yahshua’s apostles (for example, P aul’s writings) in rebuttal of the living Chosen Vessel’s words, they are speaking an abomination. God has always sent l iving prophets whose words were rebutted by leaders of th e people quoting a dead prophet’s/messiah’s words (see John 9:28 ). After a prophet of God was killed, then the fo llowing generations of leaders would claim to believe his o r her words (see Matthew 23:29-31 ). God has not changed; hence, a living anointed messenger always manifests after the death of the former anointed of God (see Deuteronomy 18:5, 18 ; Malachi 3:6 ; 4:1, 2, 5 ).

Thereby, they will be saved from the soon coming terrible time of trouble such as ne ver was in this timeline. A great multitude will be gathered after the c omet’s impact (great earthquake). They will have gladly forsaken their possessions. At that time, their earthly possessio ns will be esteemed as a menstruous cloth (see Isaiah 30:22 ). In that day, the wicked shall reluctantly forsake their man-made treasures and idols of gold and silver, as they run to the mo untains and rocks. Hence, they will fight (resist) the initial plagues of wrath in the battle of Armageddon until the last plague o f lava is loosed. When the huge meteor impacts the U.S.A., t he Christians will believe that satan is bringing thes e calamities upon them. Others will believe that it is neither God nor satan but a natural or man-made occurrence. Therefore, a person who did not forsake the U.S.A. and surrounding nations before the comet hits the land will attempt to resist the init ial plagues of destruction. However, a great multitude will be ga thered out of all non-Christian nations before the whole Earth is consumed in a flowing lake of fire. Believing that Christ of 2,000 years ago is th e messiah will not save a person living in this last generation (o ur day). The name of John the Baptist and then the name of Yahsh ua (Jesus) were the names of salvation given to the people liv ing in the generation of the apostles. A person of that gener ation who believed the words of the living anointed would be saved from believing error through his name. In the latter da ys, our generation, the saving name of the first Man Child and now the Chosen Vessel are given to save the people of this last generation from a terrible time of trouble.

Ignorance of the scriptures causes people to have a false understanding pertaining to the things of God. The Sadducees in the days of Christ (Yahshua) did not believe in the resurrection because of certain theologies they held that were n ot according to the writings of the prophets. Therefore, Yahshu a said how they greatly err because they knew not the scriptur es (see Mark 12:24 ). To understand biblical scripture is to be able to show the true meaning from the word of God itself, otherwise you will err just as the Sadducees erred. The question asked by the Sadducees was whether there would be wives in heaven.

Yahshua counsele d by saying that a person must know scripture in order t o understand"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 180 the mystery concerning whether there would be wives in heaven. The messiah’s answer to the Sadducees was that once the dead are resurrected into God’s kingdom, they will be as the angels in heaven, neither giving nor receiving in m arriage. He is not saying there are no marriages in heaven, but he is simply stating that they neither give nor receive in marri age in heaven in the manner that marriages take place on Earth. Whe n a person in this world wants to marry, the bride is traditional ly given in marriage unto the groom. In God’s kingdom, women w ill not be given unto men in marriage. The question is then a sked, how does a person in the perfect kingdom of God have a wife or husband without being given to marry? In the new e verlasting kingdom, men and women will not marry in the fashio n that marriages take place in this corrupt world. To und erstand this mystery, you must understand scripture so that you do not err pertaining to the mysteries of God. The first marriage that is recorded in biblica l scripture is found in Genesis 2:21-25 . God created Adam from the dust of the ground. God caused Adam to name all the land a nimals in Genesis 2:20 , but there was not found for Adam a help meet (feminine mate) for him. As stated in Genesis 2:18 , the Lord knew it was not good for Adam to be alone. God did not create Eve from the dust of the ground, as this would have meant Adam received and was given a wife. Had this happened, she would have been a separate entity from Adam in every way; however, this was not the case. Elohiym took a rib from wit hin Adam and made a female Adam, who was called Eve. Adam then said that Eve was bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh (s ee Genesis 2:22, 23 ). The only marriage that was personally fashione d by God in our world was the marriage of Adam and Eve. Eve di d not become Adam’s wife because from the first moment th at God removed the rib from Adam, Eve was naturally his wi fe. She was his soul-mate who was literally brought forth f rom within Adam’s body. Those whom God joins, no man can sepa rate (see Mark 10:9 ). When one died, the other died shortly thereafter of a broken heart. The only perfect joining of two (Ada m and Eve), coming from the one (Adam), was the first marriage created in Genesis. When Eve gave birth in Genesis 4:1 , Cain was the firstborn unto God and thereafter Abel was born in Genesis 4:2 . In the"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" 181 beginning, when Eve gave birth, she would bring for th twins (male and female). When Cain was born, there was a male Cain and a female Cain – his soul-mate. There was also a male Abel and a female Abel, who were male and female twins f rom the same womb. This is the reason that a woman has two breasts and two ovaries, and a man has two testicles. It w as for the reason of bringing forth twins during each concepti on. After Cain slew his brother Abel (see Genesis 4:8 ), the female Abel was left without a mate. Because of si n brought into the world by Adam and Eve’s partaking of the t ree that contained the knowledge of good and evil, God could see that there would be an imbalance once people started kil ling each other. Accordingly, a twin would be left without a mate. Therefore, God caused the process of women bearing twins, at every birth, to cease. However, this will be reins tated in the kingdom of God, which is soon to be restored in gre at glory and majesty. Cain, who was born as a male and female C ain from the womb of Eve, had no need to be given a wife nor receive a wife in marriage. Both male and female Cains were born as twins from the same womb. In a similar fashion, th e redeemed will be born in God’s kingdom with their perfect ma tes (twins). Each pair (perfect mates) will be of one mind and b ody, not being able to be divided in any way. Song of Solomon is written about the perfect t wins, who came from the same womb and drank milk from the sam e mother. “O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised” (see Song of Solomon 8:1 ). The feminine twin is saying to her brother and spou se that he is her brother (the word “wert” is in italics, meaning it was added to the text at a later date); hence, he sucked (dra nk milk) the breast of his sister’s mother. His sister’s mother is also his own mother, as they were both born as twins from the sa me womb. This reveals that they are male and female twins: perfect mates. Those who inherit God’s kingdom will each be born a s pairs from the womb of one mother as sister/brother and s pouse (see Song of Solomon 4:9, 10, 12 , ref. to sister and spouse). Now we can better understand what Yahshua meant in Mark 12:24, 25 ; that in God’s kingdom they neither give nor receive in marriage, since everyone is born with their perfect mate.

Every perfect angel in the new Earth is born with his or her perfect mate from the same womb of the s ame mother. Accordingly, all the redeemed will have their perfe ct mates, since Elohiym’s image is masculine and feminine. There are 200,000,000 figurative horses (hence 200,000,000 spirits within the minds of the redeemed) in God’s army of riders (half of these riders have Michael’s – moon’s – spi rit while the other half have Gabriel’s – duplicate sun’s – spiri t).

These horses in Revelation 9:7 have hair like women so that one may correlate them with the spiritual bride, New Jerusalem (see Revelation 9:8 ). Half of the spirits within the latter-day redee med will be placed in minds of males while the other half is pl aced in the minds of females in their new world. None will wan t a mate in God’s new kingdom, for all will already have their perfect mates from birth (see Isaiah 34:16 ).

After carefully studying Jonah’s exp erience, the understanding of which fish swallowed him can be re alized. In the second chapter of the Book of Jonah, the detail s of Jonah’s experience (while he was figuratively in the fish’s belly for three days and three nights) are recorded. The great fish that swallowed up Jonah is the awesome figurative fish called Leviathan. Leviathan is not a fish as is generally understood. Leviathan is the Great Sea i tself. Therefore, the Great Sea (Mediterranean Sea) is wha t swallowed up Jonah. Leviathan is described in the Book of Jo b as the Great Sea.

Now that we have concluded which fish (Leviath an/Great Sea) swallowed Jonah, the description of Jonah’s ex perience in the belly of this great fish (Great Sea) will be ea sily understood. Jonah 2:1 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the FISH'S {Leviathan’s/Great Sea’s} belly {depths} , 2:2 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the BELLY {depths} OF HELL {grave} cried I, and thou heardest my voice. 2:3 For thou hadst cast me into the DEEP {belly, mentioned in Jonah 2:1, 2 } , in the midst {belly} of the seas {seven seas of the Great Sea are the seven heads of Leviathan/Great Se a} ; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. The first verse in Chapter 2, verse 1 of the B ook of Jonah is a comment by someone who assumed the “belly” Jonah wa s within and praying from (in verses 2 and 3) was a f ish’s belly. Nowhere in Jonah’s own words describing his experie nce does he mention a fish or the insides of a fish of any s ort. The reason why Jonah failed to mention in his prayer (as recorded in Jonah, Chapter 2), that a literal fish swallowed him is simply that a literal fish (besides Leviathan/Great Sea) did not swallow him. Jonah’s prayer begins in verse 2 of C hapter 2. The belly that Jonah prayed from was the belly of h ell (depths of death), not the belly of a fish as is commonly beli eved. The belly of hell mentioned in verse 2 is interpreted i n verse 3. In verse 3, it states that the belly of hell is in the depth of the seas (Leviathan’s seven heads/seven seas).

As Jonah was taken down by currents (which God had prepared, see Jonah 1:17 ) to the depths (belly) of the Great Sea (hell, darkness of the deep grave), Jonah was runni ng out of air and going into hypothermia. Jonah knew that he was cast out of God’s sight, yet his faith did not waver as he loo ked (by mentally focusing) to Hayah Havah’s temple during h is last dying moments as he descended into the depths (bell y) of the Great Sea (Leviathan). Jonah 2:7 When my SOUL {hope} fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto the e, into thine holy temple. Jonah’s soul had almost given up as he was abo ut to surrender to the depths of the Great Sea, then he p rayed unto Hayah Havah as his soul entered corruption (death). The prayer of Jonah, which he directed from his conscious mind towards Hayah Havah’s temple just prior to his death, is li kened to the prayer of Yahshua (Jesus) in his dying moments upon the cross. Just prior to Yahshua giving up the ghost (as his s oul/spirit fainted within him), his final prayer was directed to Hayah Havah. Yahshua spoke his final prayer: “Father in to thy hands I commend my spirit.” Jonah’s body was literally tak en down into the depths (belly/heart) of the Great Sea (Leviatha n) and remained dead there for three days and three nights . Yahshua’s body also lay dead in the tomb (heart of the Earth) for 3-½ days. In our day, the death of Jonah and Yahshua (for 3-½ days) parallels the death of the two written witnesses fo r 3-½ days. These 3-½ days begin after each 1260-day period of prophesying to Christendom – equated with latter-day Nineveh of Assyria and latter-day Babylon of the Chaldees (see Revelation 11:3, 7, 11 ).

Jonah 2:10 And the LORD spake unto the FISH {Leviathan/Great Sea} , and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. After three days and three nights had passed – which equal the passing of 3-½ days – the lifeless and corrupte d body of Jonah was spewed up from the ocean floor onto dry l and. Jonah’s life and health were restored to him, as he was saved from the belly (depths) of hell (grave). Jonah 2:6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God. After Jonah’s experience of death for three da ys and three nights, he was revived to life to proclaim the word of God to warn the wicked of imminent destruction. The revea led word of God (Hayah Havah) is designed to turn those who wer e once rebellious towards the straight and narrow path of salvation. God revealed to Jonah by experience how the re jection of Hayah Havah’s revealed word causes a person to be s wallowed up by death. Thereafter, Jonah – after his experie nce with death – was revived having great zeal to warn Nineveh, ac cording to Hayah Havah’s present word (see Ezekiel 33:7-9 ). Jonah 3:1 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying, 3:2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. Jonah was resurrected from death after three d ays and three nights from the belly (depths) of hell (grave). Th e resurrection of Jonah typifies the resurrection of the two witne sses/duplicate sun’s and moon’s predictions (see Revelation 11:3, 7, 11 ).

Nineveh repented from their evil ways and from the violence done by their hands. Hayah Havah witnesse d Nineveh’s words of repentance and would not overthr ow Nineveh as Sodom was overthrown. During the last w arnings to Christendom, 144,000 firstfruits of wheat will repe nt of their evil beliefs and ways that are contrary to the seventh a ngel’s predictions.

Jonah was dead during 4 days – 3 daylights and 3 evenings – which parallel the 3-½ days after each of three 230 0-day periods. As Jonah revived from death and journeyed to Nineve h in one day, it parallels the predictions of the two witnes ses reviving from failure (death) to prophesy again 3-½ days aft er each 2300- day period (see Revelation 11:11 ). Jonah preached to Nineveh that it would be des troyed after 40 days.

At the end of these 3-½ days, a comet will have impact ed the land causing the massive earthquake in Revelation 11:13 . Immediately thereafter, hail of ice and coals of fi re will rain down for 40 days upon the land to destroy it (see Revelation Last Warning to Nineveh Last Warning to Latter-day Babylon Jonah 3:4 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.

These 40 days of hail are equated with the 40 d ays of rain in Noah’s generation (see Genesis 7:12 ). According to a reverse past type, the kingdoms of Assyria and Babylon typify the coalition of Christendom’s n ations. As Jonah preached to Nineveh, so latter-day Jonah (Cho sen Vessel) prophesies to latter-day Nineveh of Assyria (Christ endom) – according to the illuminated moon’s revelation of t he little scroll’s first side – and latter-day Babylon of the Chaldees (Christendom), according to the duplicate sun’s rev elation of the same little scroll’s first side (see Revelation 11:3 ). When the second spiritual wilderness journey o f 1263-½ days ends, latter-day Nineveh/Babylon will have totally rejected (killed) the little scroll’s warnings of the sevent h angel’s seven thunders (see Revelation 11:7 ). Accordingly, the figurative bodies (illuminated moon and duplicate sun) of the two witnesses are left for dead, as Christendom shows n o respect for their testimony/predictions (see Revelation 11:8 ). At the end of the 3-½ days of Revelation 11:9 , a comet’s impact-induced great earthquake (see Revelation 11:13 ) will have been fulfilled as predicted by the first side of the little scroll’s two witnesses. Therefore, the little scro ll’s predictions by the two witnesses – moon and duplicate sun – wil l have revived to life (see Revelation 11:11 ) to begin fulfilling all their warnings. At the same time, the people who believe d and proclaimed to Christendom the predictions – doctrin e of spiritual rain, see Deuteronomy 32:2 ; Malachi 3:10 ; Revelation 11:6 – of the two witnesses will also revive to life (see Revelation 6:10, 11 ). After the 3-½ days when the comet hits the land , hard rain (hail) will be pummeling the land instead of soft r ain (doctrine) for 40 days. There will be no more prophesying to latter-day Nineveh or latter-day Babylon (Christendom), as the re was when the Chosen Vessel’s doctrine revived in Christendom 3-½ days after the first 2300-day period ended and again 3-½ days after the second 2300-day period ended."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" 201 Old Nineveh Repents Latter-day Babylon Rebels Jonah 3:6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.

The verse in Exodus 3:14 has been rewritten here without the additions of translators. The above English transl ation in Exodus 3:14 is of the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. The word “God” in Exodus 3:14 was translated from the Hebrew word Elohiym, which means “Gods” in the plural form. Fo r instance, El refers to God in the singular form, and by addin g “iym” to El it creates a plural form: El (Bel) = God/god iym (im) = plural Elohiym refers to both the eternal Father and the e ternal Mother: God the Father & Mother = Elohiym 1 John 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word {scroll of life made flesh} , and the Holy Ghost {Mother} : and these three are one. In Exodus 3:14 of the King James Bible, it erroneously quotes the name that Elohiym (God the Father and Mother) g ave to Moses: I AM THAT I AM The word Elohiym means Gods. These Gods were speaking with one voice (Metatron) to Moses. Therefore, Elo hiym did not give their name as I AM THAT I AM. The translators not knowing the implication of the plurality of Elohiym added the"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 210 word “I” and the word “THAT” in Exodus 3:14 . This verse, which is quoting a name of God as “I AM THAT I AM,” should read “AM AM.” When Am Am – hence, two Ams – are compared with the plural form of Elohiym (Gods), it then makes sense. Elohiym is plural for God the Father and God the Mo ther. Am Am is also plural (two Ams) for God the Father a nd God the Mother. The names of “Am” and “Am” reveal that Elo hiym is and inhabits eternity. In other words, there has n ever been a time when Elohiym has not existed. Elohiym (the masculi ne and feminine God) has always been and is ever present; hence the term “Am Am.” Elohiym is all (physical and spiritu al) and in all of creation. In the Old Testament, most Bibles erroneously use t he word God (Elohiym) in its singular form instead of its p lural form. Even the word LORD (Hayah Havah/Am Am) is written i n its singular form when it should be written in its plur al form. There are some verses in the Old Testament that properly use the word Elohiym (written as God in the KJV) in its plural f orm. Genesis 1:26 And ELOHIYM said, Let US make man in OUR image, after OUR likeness... . Genesis 3:22 And ELOHIYM said, Behold, the man is become as one of US, to know good and evil... . Genesis 11:7 Go to, let US go down, and there confound their language... . In Deuteronomy 6:4 , it states that Hayah (Am) Havah (Am) is ONE (Echad). The word “one” in Deuteronomy 6:4 refers to a compounded one, which means that God the Father and Mother are one: consummate. The word “one” in Deuteronomy 6:4 is translated from the Hebrew word “Echad.” Echad’s m eaning in the context of Deuteronomy 6:4 refers to the masculine and feminine God, unified as one (Echad): indivisible. Deuteronomy 6:4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD {Hayah/Am Havah/Am} our God {Elohiym} is ONE {Echad/one compound: masculine and feminine} LORD . "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 211 Moses was told that Elohiym’s (Father and Moth er of creation) name was Hayah/Am Havah/Am. A careful st udy of the word Yahweh reveals the “Yah” was taken from Ha yah, and the “Weh/Veh or Wah/Vah” was derived from Havah/Haveh/Hoveh. Elohiym’s name is the two words Am Am or Is Is, which are the same name. Therefore, Haya h Havah/Hawah/Hoveh abbreviated as Yah (Yeh/Yoh) and Vah (Veh/Weh) became Yahwah/Yehweh/Yohweh/Yahweh. Many people pray in the name of Yahweh or Jeho vah. However, they do not understand the meaning of the name they are praying to. If a person prays in the name of Y ahweh, Jehovah, or God without knowing the plural meaning of Hayah Havah (Hoveh Hayah), they are ignorantly praying to an idol. Moses was told the name Hayah Havah in Exodus 3:14 ; Hayah (Am) referred to God the Father, and Havah (Am) ref erred to God the Mother. Elohiym (Gods) is the plural word for God, which refers to both the heavenly Father and Mother (feminine Holy Spirit) as one. Hayah Havah is the plural nam e of the masculine and feminine God. Today, many people pra y to an idol that their heart and mind has conjured up. Th ey do this because they do not know the correct masculine and feminine plurality-meaning of Adonay, Elohiym, Metatron, or Hayah Havah. The original words given to Moses in Exodus 3:14 were Hayah Havah (Hoveh), which were general words in He brew that simply meant Am Am or Is Is. However, after E lohiym named themselves Hayah Havah for the first time (as stated in Exodus 6:3 ), the words Hayah Havah became most holy. The Hebrews, not wanting to use Elohiym’s new name of H ayah Havah in general conversation, decided to create a new word. Therefore, the Hebrews of their own accord took the last three letters of haYAH and the last three letters of haVA H and combined them to make Yahvah (the letters e, o, or a, – and v or w – are phonetically interchangeable in English wor ds translated from Hebrew). The combined word Yahvah (Yahveh) re placed the words Hayah Havah. In these latter days (our d ay), God’s prophetic writings are illuminated with the correct meaning and understanding; now there is now no excuse for remai ning in confusion. Hayah Havah was the name Elohiym gave to Moses on Mt. Horeb – also named Sinai (see Exodus 3:14 ). Thereafter, the"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 212 new name of Hayah Havah was combined to make Yahvah (Yahweh). The people who originally used the word Yahvah knew that it was an abbreviated form of Hayah Havah . Accordingly, the meaning of Hayah Havah, which was first given to Moses, was originally known. Later, throu gh the centuries and down to our day, the meaning of Hayah Havah was obscured. This is the reason why the Bible transla tors substituted the phrase “I Am That I Am” for Hayah H avah (Am Am). From the Hebrew word Yahweh (Yahvah), the Bib le translators relying on Greek manuscripts of scriptu re came up with the transliterated word Jehovah. In the days of Moses, the Hebrew scriptures we re written without vowels, using only consonants and were read from right to left. Accordingly, Hayah Havah would have been written from right to left as HVH HYH, Yahvah (Yahwah/Yahwe h) as HVHY, and Yahwah as HWHY. As the centuries passed, grammar progressed. Small marks were used as vowel s; and later, spacing between words was introduced. There after, vowels were added to the written text. However, no vowels were initially added to the letters YHVH (YHWH) unt il the Hebrew and Greek transcripts were translated into o ther languages. The vowels in the word Yehovah were tak en from the word Elohiym and Adonay. Thereby, the English translation of YHVH (YHWH) became YeHoVaH (Jehovah) by adding t he first two vowels of Elohiym and the first letter of Adonay. Elohiym’s new name that was given to Moses in Exodus 3:14 was Hayah Havah, the combined One (Echad/Metatron): God the Father and God the Mother. If the understandin g of the plurality of Elohiym (Gods) is not in your mind whe n praying or reading the Bible, then an idol is whom you are pra ying to (see Exodus 20:3-5 ). By the revealed knowledge of Hayah Havah’s scr oll of life in these last days is how the wise are justified and s anctified. Be not deceived. Elohiym (Am Am) is not the author of confusion; rather the fool chooses to remain confused by rejec ting present truth. In the Old Testament part of the King James Bi ble, certain words that refer to God were translated from Hebrew words that referred to the plurality of God.

This word Almighty was translated from the H ebrew word “Shadday.” The word Shad (Shod) is generally used in writings to denote the “Breast” of a female animal or woman. When Shadday is used in biblical scripture, it is d escribing the feminine Holy Spirit (God the Mother: Havah/Am). I n Genesis 17:1 , it states, “...I (Holy Spirit) am the Almighty (Sha dday) God (El)...” The feminine Holy Spirit is the Almig hty/Shadday God/El who was speaking directly to Abraham in Genesis 17:1 . There are times when the word “God” (El) is co rrectly written in its singular form, especially when linked to the word Almighty (Shadday). In other instances, the word “ God” (Elohiym) is often used in the Old Testament part o f the KJV Bible where it refers to God’s plurality: the femin ine and the masculine. The words “GOD” and “LORD” in upper cas e letters are translated from the Tetragrammaton (YHWH/Yahweh ). Therefore, when the word “LORD” and “GOD” are writt en exclusively in upper case letters in the Old Testam ent only (KJV), they must be read with their plural (masculi ne and feminine) meaning in mind. It is not the mere reading of divine words tha t justify and sanctify a person. It is the correct meaning and u nderstanding of divine prophetic words that justify and sanctify an individual.

Exodus 23:24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utte rly overthrow them, and quite break down their images. Elohiym also stated that the “names” of these false gods must not be uttered. Instead, they must be removed from the land. In our day, this land refers to a person’s mind, heart , and body.

Those who reject the living messenger’s interpretation of biblical scripture (which is writ ten with the phrase “Thus saith the Lord”) will be taking away t he true meaning of Elohiym’s written words (see Revelation 22:18, 19 ). When Hayah Havah stated to not serve or use th e names of other gods, Adonay (Elohiym) was not referring to t itles. For instance, the Hebrew word “El” is a general title t hat can be used for addressing any deity. In Greek, the word Theos is also a general title for any deity. Many people quote the words God, Yahweh, Theos, and Elohiym, yet in their mind they usually make a masculine image of God – Yahweh, Theos, or E lohiym. The true image of the living God – Yahweh, Elohiym, or Theos – is masculine and feminine. Anything else is of c onfusion. The words God (English), El (Hebrew), Bel (Bab ylonian), Theos (Greek), and Allah (Arabic) are all titles th at can and are used to address any deity. For instance, God is El ohiym, El is Yahweh, or God is Zeus, and El is Dagon. When God stated to not use or follow the names of strange/foreign gods (elohiym), the personal names of some of these gods whom Hayah Havah referred to are Zeus, Malchom (Milcom), Dagon, Asht oreth, Chemosh, Molech, and Dianna. Any Israelite who perf ormed rituals that were associated with these gods and th eir names was to be stoned; this is what Deuteronomy 12:3 means.
