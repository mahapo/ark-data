The people of the world are being tricked, duped, played like a deck of cards by a hidden (and Satanic ) communist oligarchy of 'illuminati' international banking magnates. In other words, whole planet is being run under a World Government *already*, they are just using terrorism and lies right now to establish more control as tyrants have done and still do . Astonishingly, it has been recently discovered, in the year 2005, that the biggest events of the world in the last 100 years have been conducted by the Illuminati on occult numbered dates especially the World Wars. This book proves the fact that humanity itself has been continuosly and massively deceived and manipulated by elite personages who ritually worship the \" angel of the abyss\", the father of all lies, and secretly rule the whole world through their privatized corporate banking complex . And the good news (and there is good news despite the bad news) is that Jesus will certainly soon come to chain the beast back into the abyss through the power granted to Him by the Father and bestow his blessing of forgiveness and eternal life onto His followers; those who have believed and trusted in Him. This book contains over 1000 historical facts and proves to those who might be on the fence that God Our Father's word is true and just; for the faithful and righteous Jewish; Christians; Muslims, etc. Israel has been tricked, America has been tricked, the whole world has been duped by the devil.

This one book focuses in on one angle of the Illuminati's methodology within their overall Conspiracy to dominate the whole world: their occult numerology . There are dozens of other books and films that go into more detail from the many other angles of the overall Illuminati NeoConspiracy planning Satan's \"New World Order\"."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Samples of how the Illuminati have celebrated \"anniversaries\" of some Key Events: On April \" 19 th\", 1775 at the the Battle of Lexington and Concord British General Thomas Gage attempts to confiscate American colonistsí firearms. The British are driven back to Boston, Massachusetts. The American Revolutionary War begins . On another April \" 19 th\", in 1943, World War II German troops enter the Warsaw ghetto to round up the remaining Jews, starting the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising . So on the 218th and 50th anniversaries of these events we have April \" 19 th\" 1993 in WACO Texas - a state raid/purge of a non-establishment religious assemblage in a fiery maelstrom on American soil where 81 men, women, and children are burnt to death because they had assembled in a church of their faith. International troops are used. It was an entirely illuminati engineered operation. 2 year later, on the August \" 19 th\", 1995 Federal conspirators detonate bombs inside and 1 outside the Oklahoma City Murrah building in which covert army agent/operative Tim McVeigh serves his 'duty' as a patsy. By the numerics used thoughout the entire coverup it became clearly an illuminati operation. On \"September 11 th\", 19 41 the groundbreaking ceremonies of the Pentagon ( modeled after the inside of a satanic five pointed pentagram symbol ) were held. On the 30th anniversary of that event on \"September 11 th\", 19 71 , the USSRís deposed leader Nikita Khrushchev died a mysterious death under house arrest. So September 11 th, 20 01 became the 30th anniversary of this event in illuminati controlled Soviet politics and the 60th anniversary of the groundbreaking of the Pentagon. (The Pentagon was built in that form as it is the inside of a pentagram symbol.) 1 year later on \"September 11th\", the world was introduced to terrorism at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. There were 121 participating countries (11X11=121), and 11 Israeli athletes were killed in the events that occured on 9/11 /1972. Exactly 29 years (2+9=\"11\") after this terrorist horror ended, a more despicable horror occurred, the September 11th, 2001 illuminati staged inside job \"terror attack\". The following year on \"September 11 th\", 19 73 Chilean President Salvador Allende is killed in a brutal, violent military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet. Henry Kissinger was strongly implicated in this attack, and if he were to ever stand trial in an International Court, he would be charged with masterminding this coup and ordering the assassination of Allende. [\"The Latest Kissinger Outrage: Why is a proven liar and wanted man in charge of the 9/11 investigation?\", by Christopher Hitchens, 11/27/2002.] 28 years later, Mr. Kissinger helped mastermind a more horrendous attack on 9/11/01. On April \" 11 th\", 1990, Mikhail Gorbechev was quoted as saying \" We are only beginning to shape the New World Order. \" ( He became the Soviet leader on March \" 11 th\", 1985 - exactly \" 19 \" years to the day of the Madrid Blast on 3/ 11 /04 which killed 202 Eupropean travellers! This was how the illuminati terror masterminds celebrated the 19 th anniversary of Gorbechev's inauguration and Gorby knew it! ) Exactly 5 months after Mikhailís statement and on the \" 19 th\" anniversary of Khrushchev's assassination, and the 49th (7x7) anniversary of the Pentagon construction, on September \"11th\", 1990 George Bush I, as president at that time in a speech he entitled \"Toward a New World\" stated: \"What is at stake is more that one country [meaning the United States of America!], it is a New World Order, where diverse nations are brought together in common cause to reach the aspirations of mankind...\" Yes, he stated this on \" 9/11 \"/1990!!! Bush I was reminding the congressional country club of their intrinsic allegiance to the overall plan of soon forming a *one world government* at the expense and wholesale slaughter of billions of innocent freedom loving people around the world - including 150-200 million Americans; a worldwide holocaust first to begin with America's destruction ! Then 1-1/2 years later he said in front of the UN: \" It is the sacred principles enshrined in the United Nations charter to which the American people will henceforth pledge their allegiance. \" - Bush I addressing the General Assembly of the U.N., February 1st, (2+1=\"3\") 1992. Exactly \" 11 \" years to the day of this speech the special UN Space Shuttle mission Columbia Flight STS 10\" 7 \" was sacrificed coming in above the 33 rd degree parallel. Dick Cheney was out in a field hunting that morning in Dallas Texas right under it. (quite obviously so he could see the smoke of it in full view as it occured.) \" 6 \" months after 9/11/01, from March \" 11 th\", 2002 to April \" 13 th\" the WTC center is íilluminatedí with \" 88 \"(8x11) floodlights making the worldís tallest \" 11 \" for \" 33 \"(3x11) nights!!!!!! Freemasons who serve and worship the illuminati love the number 33 - it is their highest 'degree'. The lights are programmed to go on at \" 6:3 \"0 and off at \" 11 \":00pm.

With the truth presented here being stranger than any work of fiction, the result may be that the reader never views the nightly \"news\" or current establishment \"history\" books the same way again. Instead, those who come to understand this may be more inclined to paste 'peel & stick' arrows on their televisions with the words \"liar-->\" or \"teleprompt reader-->\" on them, or perhaps shoot suction cup tipped plastic darts with the word \"repent\" written on the side and see if they can peg 'Peter Jennings' or 'Walter Cronkite' or 'Barbara Walters' squarely in the center of their foreheads as they attempt to coax the remainder of the herd into continued bloodshed and United Nations world governance . The paper recycling industry might undergo an unexpected boon as people throw their old college 'history' books or { Rockefeller group published } 'Encyclopedia Brittanicas' or 'Warren Buffet' investment advice books in large waste buckets for roadside pickup. This report proves We have *all* been massively lied-to/manipulated by elite individuals. On September 11th, 2001 two great symbols of American power were attacked in a way that was spectacular to say the least. Whether you are young or old, black or white, male or female, images from that day will undoubtedly stay with you forever. But despite the almost universal familiarity of this event, few people understand its staggering, unprecedented importance. As indelible a memory as 9/11 may have cast, its true significance is literally out of this world . REVELATION 9:11 : \" And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon. \" ( KJV ) The implies whole world is the Devils' Theatre, which it is - as I John 5:9 states that \" the whole world is control of the evil one. \" as well. The numerology exposed in the remainder of this book is absolutely mindblowing . It is a wonder to this researcher that this has not been clearly seen before by those working outside the realm of the evident Conspiracy. Clearly The Father in heaven has wished it to *now* be seen and detailed in report(s) such as this with His Blessing and by His Will . The occult illuminati are real. They even have a network of devil worshipping websites: http://www.ordoantichristianusilluminati.org & http://www.93current.de The Illuminati now give awards to militaries: \" Navy E-Learning Captures 2003 Illuminati Award\" See: http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id= 6636 (!!!!!) This report will shine light on the following startling fact. America has been run like a privately owned and managed corporation since the illuminati international bankers hijacked the American people's money supply in 1913 with the deceptive Federal Reserve Act . This money scam has produced an international clan of powerful multi-trillionaire families. This is in part how the illuminati control the world; being the power behind the UN. Bush Jr. is only a mid-level manager *for them*, not The People . He has been groomed . His assignment is to lie to the world's people and jack-up the police state in America. That is what is happening; for Americans will soon be revolting in the streets. The Bush administration allows for and helps terrorism to occur around the world, including onto America, on behalf of an international corporation run generationally by a roundtable of devil worshipping financial overlords. These dark overlords are planning more horrible"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"events: smallpox, deadly influenza plagues and possibly nuclear explosions in America and other places in the world, to coax and force the world into a world government continuously operated by them ; while The People are to be held continuously deceived. When the next set of larger events occur; then likely most people will begin to care to be more aware . Cable-tv 'news' will be increasingly exposed as regionalized propaganda arms of national governments and militaries - and increasingly avoided. Football, baseball, soccer, and basketball games will shift, at least temporarily, from being perceived as mass attractions to mass distractions. Knowledge-filled reports like this will get read and distributed at greater rates by greater numbers; hopefully causing an unstoppable convergence within the global community upon this truth. Lastly, political and monetary reformation will be demanded and uncompromised, elected ,1-term only, state governors will be sought by The People around the world. Those in the know should hope so. As of the start of year 2005 however, The People of the world still are under the influence (delusional 'spell') of a satanically engineered 'historical' timeline . This is shocking, almost unbelievable, but true . This report proves that fact. The evidence here highly suggests the next series of horrible events to be witnessed this year and possibly the next have already been planned out . The dates and times to which will occur will have an occult numerological significance to our hidden illuminati international banking elite sponsored devil worshipping governors/controllers; such as the Rothschilds.

Each person only has varying headstrong opinions on how the world is being operated, from mainstream views dictated by the illuminati/CIA controlled establishment mass media ( truly a constant stream of manipulative lies ), to those who understand the hidden conspiratorial details of what this report will disclose to those who will open their mind to this new revelation in knowledge. This report exposes a current revolution being engineered and deceptively taking place over recent years to overthrow the once constitutionally framed Republic of the United States of America and force a world government run by multi-trillionaire elites, big business, and political fascism on the people of the whole world. Just like Vladimir Lenin used terror to gain power over the Russian people many decades ago, the communist illuminati bankers have been sponsoring terrorism and warfare in every country around the entire world: Israel, Palestine, America, Iraq, Iran, England, etc... all are not immune/protected. They like to destablize areas, incite fear and hatred in the populations against each other and create \"Order out of Chaos \". They practice political terror around the world. They fund groups such as Hamas, and finance and control all the intelligence agencies and the media to have the blame layed on others, erase the illuminati from the public's perception, and generate propaganda to control the minds of both sides.

And you may care to know what that statement on the back of every American Dollar \" Annuit Coeptis Novus Ordo Seclorum \" really means. It basically means the end of the world as you have grown to know it all your life. It translates from Latin into \" Announcing the Conquest of the Secular New World \". ( That literally means a world without sincere recognition of the *true* God the Father! ) How patently obvious the scheme of the ruling elite truly is! The American money system, the \" Federal Reserve \" was designed by the wealthiest and most powerful of this world as the largest of financial scams known to mankind. Sadly, the name itself was crafted as a lie. This is a private affair , the bank that prints the paper American money is *not* 'Federal' , and there is *no* 'Reserve' . Each Federal Reserve Note is a paper credit . What a huge financial problem the USA is now left to face! Yes, indeed, these facts are hard to reckon with; but group denial will get us nowhere new. \" I have unwittingly ruined my country. \" - Woodrow Wilson, unwittingly said soon after signing the deceptive Federal Reserve Act into law over Christmas 1913. \" A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation and all of our activities are in the hands of a FEW men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely CONTROLLED and dominated governments in the world no longer a government of free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of SMALL groups of dominant men. \" - Woodrow Wilson, \"Campaign Speeches\", 1912 ( stated 1 year previous to the quotation above. ) Yes, quite unfortunately, for any third-world citizen to middle-class American, the world has been deceptively controlled for over 100 years by a small elite clique of money and credit mafia who don't wish to be generally known, otherwise known as illuminati kingpins . The following report is *not* groundless information based on speculative ideas. The following paragraphs describe the general unmistakable facts surrounding a global revolution being run by shadowy elite international bankers that has the stated objective to enslave every man, woman, and child ( yes, even yourself! ) permanently under the dictates of a one world 'hitlerian-style' tyranny as fast as they can ; where all forms of checks and balances preventing abuses of power against the People have been totally removed . How else can this be written or stated so that it may be actively recognized? This may be similar to Berlin Germany 1939 in all American neighborhoods in 2005/6/7! Perhaps this can be thought of as \"King George's Revenge!\".

This report shows the monstrous reality of it. It is truly time Americans unplug the cable going in the back of their TVs and support those telling them the truth, such as Alex Jones, and those listed in the Who's Who that this researcher has assembled. \" The Technetronic era involves the gradual appearence of a more CONTROLLED society. Such a society would be dominated by an ELITE, unrestrained by traditional values. \" - Zbigniew Brzezinski, Advisor to 5 U.S. Presidents and Executive Director the Trilateral Commission. Quoted from the book \"Between two Ages\". In simplest terms, this is a mounting global movement of the rich and powerful vs. the many, the poor, and the weak. History has reflected that society seems to never learn from it. At this hour, most people of the world are poor and in large credit debt ( by the banker's design ), they are intentionally \"misinformed\", and worse they are spiritually \"fragmented\"; yet slim minorities now clearly have amassed immense wealth through Machiavellian political control and deceptively large-scale financial trickery . This trend has been only continuing and the gap has been only widening. Through the illuminati's influences over international finance and culture the illuminati globalists have intentionally bankrupted, demoralized and in-effect conquered the world for Satan while most people have been psychologically duped by print and televised propaganda rather unsuspectingly. So, if you add up the surpluses of all the nations and add up their debts, you will find out all the nations together are massively in debt! But to who? The answer is elite international banking magnates of a mostly European based blue-blood aristocracy managing a worldwide monarchy of 'leaders' they continuously implant while only casting the ' perception of democracy' to the People! What ever happened to our concept of a Republic where perpetual inalienable rights are granted for all and government is held in check? To get around such ideas, our bloodthirsty hidden governors have (long-ago) managed to create a 'system' where they profit endlessly off the backs of the underclass, the common people; performed with most not even knowing or being concerned about it . In short, the American Government has been quietly replaced by a land of dark occultic powers controlling masses of clueless people who are stumbling blindly behind a faulty leadership (of either the 2 primary parties) into a predictable morass of serfdom and slavery greater than the days of the Babylonian empire or that of ancient Rome. Spiritually, there is a discernable spectrum across our society from light, that what wishes itself to be known to others, unto spiritual darkness, that what wishes to stay hidden from exposure. From a spiritual view, one end of the spectrum are found those who deeply know the truth prescribed in the gospels and biblical prophecy, who love the truth of Jesus Christ and strive to serve Him in their daily lives by obeying Our Father. On the other end of the spectrum are found those who deeply hate the serving of others, in their sin they only wish to ultimately serve themselves, and their dark master, known as: Satan, Lucifer, the devil . These are the illuminati; however, the illuminati have developed a temporary advantage for themselves, they control the world's money and credit system. As the Bible repetively teaches: one end of the spectrum follows spiritual life; the other end of the spectrum follows spiritual death. There are a great many who know themselves to be flucuating somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, being sucked like gravity toward darkness by selfishness; by his/her own accord. The conspirators have been deriving a strong (temporary) power from the \" angel of the abyss \" to perform their diabolical deeds."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Back to the societal problem at hand: as millions of people have of late become have become aware, it is truly no secret or 'theory' anymore that handfuls of unelected and clandestine international bankers have been ruling the planetscape deceptively in the true form of a global aristocracy , shrouded in complete secrecy by the establishment mass media , and they are now actively engineering a 3rd World War to usher in their vision for a \" New World Order \" global government. The illuminati have been meddling for a long time, since 1776 in fact , the first year America became 'independent'; they are still there . This report was written because this one person felt that if The People are being lied to through their televisions year in and out, they at least deserve to be warned that they are being deceived ; how & why and the magnitude of it - what will only happen if everyone now decides to do little in advance to help shorten and overcome the absolutely horrible consequences that will assuredely occur later if little is done now.

But if you want to continue the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your slavery, let them continue to create money and to control credit. \" - Sir Joseph Stamp, Banker Perhaps most people will dis credit any notion that they have been deceived and will read no farther into this. As capitalists-to-the-max themselves, they deeply relate and sympathize with the establishment and power elite and willingly lay their complete trust in them; often to the extent their compliance resembles an act of worship. There are many who see eye to eye with the global regime. In their starkly selfish sinful nature, they ardently only wish to turn a blind eye to the mounting tyranny and state-sponsored political terrorism actively being played out on their global neighbors. They care not. How many there are, who have such great confidence in their own opinions, who are ready to hazard their souls upon the truth of them, who have made up their minds on the most important and solemn of subjects. While under the influence of selfishness many enter the Christian church hugging the establishment's delusions, following the guidance and instruction of those who are perhaps as much under the dominion of an evil eye, as they are themselves, and whose mind is as full of darkness as their own. And thus they go on, unsuspectingly, while Christ has assured them in the most solemn manner, that if their eye is evil, their whole body is full of darkness. Still they believe it not . They have the highest confidence in their own opinions, and in the safety of their state; and thus rush on, with a kind of mad assurance, to the depths of hell. Let us be reminded of this lesson that Jesus stated and left us with: \" The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light; but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness. No man can serve two masters. . . Ye cannot serve The Father and money. \" ( Matthew 6:22-24 ) Selfish minds are very willing to be led, by selfish ministers, as they naturally see eye to eye. Having similar experiences, they will naturally understand each other. A carnal church will naturally be pleased with a carnal minister. A carnal minister will not see the defects of a carnal church. And thus they will be able to walk together, because they are agreed. Yes, there is a important distinction between a person who clearly sees the great evil mounting in this world, deeply wishing to warn others of it, and one who would delight in disregarding it repetitively until the next Monday night football game, shopping spree to the mall, or political convention.

Each person soon will have to choose between serving Our Father's Will vs. the will of \"the system\" - as one cannot serve both as clearly they are opposite in nature. Many will take the prophetic \" mark of the beast \" and sacrifice their souls eternally, and some will hold to their testimony of Jesus unto their physical, yet not spiritual, deaths as has already been written in scripture; Jesus knows everyone's hearts & minds and keeps all his promises. \" But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. \" ( 1 John 1:7 ) For further reading on this, this is recommened: http://www.libertytothecaptives.net/single_eye.html Simply we must allow in the light of truth as a People and discover the horrible plans the global elite have had in mind ( in advance of their continued murderous actions ). \" We shall have World Government. whether or not we like it.

Common sense states that we should not decide to repetively *procrastinate* group efforts of mass education until more devestating attacks are engineered and multiple American ( and subsequently European ) nations succumb to living under martial-law style military dictatorships through various decrees of 'executive orders' or the activation of previously signed EOs now dangerously laying in wait; many of the most damaging signed while the current president's father held the office. If so, information such as this book will likely become strongly censored by the establishment . In other words, the internet may be completely disabled by the elite ( using a scapegoat terrorism excuse ) and subsequently 'filtered' for so-called, although false, \" national security \" reasons.

Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

Grant Wardlaw, an expert on terrorism, in his book ' Political Terrorism: Theory, Tactics, and Countermeasures ' defined 'political terrorism' as: \" The use, or threat of use, of violence by an individual or a group, whether acting for or in opposition to established authority, when such action is designed to create extreme anxiety and/or fear inducing effects in a target group larger than the immediate victims for the purpose of coercing that group into acceding to the political demands of the perpetrators. \" Aside from the litany of unctuous lies that The People have been told to legitimize this war in the minds of the middle-class, there are solutions to the world's problems that they are not willing to tell us about, notably inexhaustible energy breakthroughs such as: http://www. BlackLightPower .com ( Greater than Fire! 1200+ MPG! ) and UFO-grade lifting (\"anti-gravitic\") technologies that defy gravity and would eventually allow the common person to travel in 'levitating vehicles' to any point in the world - quickly. What could be a more horrifying picture for the secretive and hidden ruling elite to imagine than that? Surely, sharing a bottle of their finest wines at their private palacial estates with a common person is unquestionable by their incredibly selfish standards. Chapter 1: The Conspiracy Behind the Stage In 1976, Taylor Caldwell demonstrated in her summary of the Iron Mountain Report , the military genius of plans by Rothschild, Albert Pike and the World Revolutionary Movement, she wrote: \" There will be no peace in the tormented world, only a PROGRAMMED and SYSTEMATIC series of wars and calamities -- until the PLOTTERS have gained their objective: an exhausted world, willing to submit to a planned Marxist economy, and total and meek enslavement -- in the name of peace. \" ( Taylor Caldwell, Ceremony of the Innocent, p.289, Fawcett Books 1976; Leonard C. Lewin, Report From Iron Mountain On the Possibility and Desirability of Peace, 1967; Ralph Epperson, The Unseen Hand, 1985 ) This major dilemma is barely perceivable for those in the middle-class to clearly understand because we have all been taught all our lives, through their influence, that our world works in a much different way than it is actually does . In other words: there is a BIG reason for everyone worldwide to understand *what is really going on* geo-politically, flown above our heads, albeit the greater truths presented here are difficult to see at first. Yet upon the discovery of the facts stated below, why would any family or group of freedom-loving people continue to go ahead blindly trusting their 'federal' government on what they are now being told in the media; after so much has already been disclosed over the many years about the worsening character of their 'leaders' (of either party), perhaps better said 'dealers' and the true nature of this global aristocracy / plutocracy ? Worsening governments never have corrected themselves; it is the People's responsibility, obligation, and right to fix things as clearly outlined in the American Constitution. However, this is a more 'sophisticated' world than it was in 1776. \" The world's power structures have always ' divided to conquer ' and have always ' kept divided to keep conquered . ' As a consequence the power structure has so divided humanity--not only into special function categories but into religious and language and color categories--that individual humans are now helplessly inarticulate in the face of the present crisis. They consider their political representation to be completely corrupted therefore they feel almost utterly helpless. \" - R. Buckminster Fuller (1981) Critical Path"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"And it is the intent of this book to provide this alarming fact to people of every location, culture, language, and political \"opinion\" - that at the top most levels of this world a hidden *world government*, a \" hidden hand \", is now already formed by an exclusive roundtable of ultra wealthy unelected elitist individuals. These 'elitists' just haven't publicly and officially announced themselves; yet their acts of meddling have become more obvious. These shadowy figures are not nice people. Research on multiple fronts has shown these powerful yet mysterious individuals secretly deal in black magic occult practices and worship false gods including the devil itself, popularly known as the \" anti-christ \", \" Satan \", \" Lucifer \", \" The Great Architect \", or \" The Bearer of Light \". Why ? It may be because The Bible ( any translation ) makes it clear that a camel would have an easier time passing through the eye of a needle than for the average multi-billionaire to enter the gates of heaven. So, perhaps they have consciously chosen in advance of any judgement they would ultimately each rather extend and grow their rein on earth and after their deaths - in a \" lake of fire \" - than serve others as angels on earth or later in the heavenly realm of God Our Father's eternal kingdom. This may all come as a shock to the reader, you, however it is not the intention of this report to cause fear or disbelief through the hundreds of unmistakable facts presented in this report. The name \" Lucifer \" is currently chosen by the United Nations in reference to the \"One World\" or \"New World Order\" religion they now have in mind for all the world's people. After the coming third world war, the plan is if a survivor of the war accepts the pledge of their soul to Lucifer, the ruling class of the new world government may allow the average 'king of queen of Sheba' to live longer into their earthly life; that is, as long as that person is considered attractive or profitable by the establishment elite to have around. However, by doing so, one would choose to offer up their eternal soul as 'payment' or as a 'right to continue living tax'. Believe it or not, this is actual policy that has been drafted in this past decade by the United Nations' Planetary committee. A member of the United Nations' staff, David Spangler stated: \" No one will enter the New World Order unless he or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer. No one will enter the New Age unless he will take a Luciferian Initiation. \"; stated while serving as director of The Planetary Initiative of the United Nations. This is a factual and true quotation. Basically they will like you more if you worship the same false god that the ruling elite have chosen to believe in. John, an apostle of Jesus Christ stated in his gospel text: \"the whole world is under the control of the evil one.\" (I John 5:19 NIV) Well, was John wrong? Does his gospel contain an error? Let's use this statement as the basis for our continued examination here. The presence of Lucifer is already a part of all our daily lives around the world. The devil's image can be found on our paper money and many trademark logos of large corporations; the \" all seeing eye \" on top of the pyramid on the dollar ( if you look close at this eye on the dollar, you will notice it is not a human eye - but a scaley lizard eye! Time out. Try a second look right now. ), AOL's logo, or the CBS ('See-BS') logo are just three examples. The Bank of America Logo has two red and one blue 11's ( 3x11=\" 33 \" - Freemasonry's second favorite number. ) See how the Illuminati's 'all seeing eye' symbol is being used on sites such as: GlobalSecurity.com: http://www.globalsecurity.org/eye/index.html Even the movie company logos express their purpose and allegiance. From the Statue of Liberty-like Columbia logo to the Sphinx from Hollywood Pictures, the pyramid from Trimark, the Paramount logo with its \" 22 \" (5 pointed) stars, and the constellation from Orion Pictures, the intent is clear. At your local mall, take a closer second look at the logo for the \"Watch World\" store or on the movie posters for \"National Treasure\" ( the real"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Conspiracy fictionalized through Hollywood with the headline \" The clues are right in front of your eyes .\"!!! ) Hollywood is not perceived as reality, so they made this film to confuse us! Not surprisingly Bill Gates has shown to be a practicing occultist as well. If you take another look at the Microsoft logo, you perhaps can easily see that it is a \" 7 \"x\" 7 \" array of dots leading up to an \" 11 \" overlayed by a \" 13 \" next to another \" 3 \" that forms a \" 33 \" ( May \" 22 nd\" 1990 - Windows 3.0 is released by Microsoft.

Recognized practices of devil worship include: polytheism, paganism, witchcraft, ritual abuse, and ritual blood sacrifice - either animal or human, yet preferably human. Primarily for these reasons worship of the devil is often described as an \"occult\" activity. The world 'occult' literally means 'hidden'. Occult practices are conducted at the home/closet level, group level, national level, and world level. The great masses of people worldwide, the mainstream, have never accepted devil worship as completely normal. Most people feel in their soul it is wrong. It is known by those who worship the devil, that they are often rewarded in some way, usually financial, for their misconduct and disobedience against God Our Father, and His Commandments. In others words, those who lie, cheat, steal, and worst - murder often do so usually to gain material advantage. Our politicians may know this best as they do most of these acts over and over again each day to varying degrees. Each of them may or may not be directly involved with actual devil worship. Those who attend the \" Bohemian Grove \" ritual each year in northern California certainly are, but most in the hallways of our congresses intentionally turn a blind eye to these types of activities. Worst of all, congresspersons consciously turn a blind eye to the 'hidden elite' often described as the 'Illuminati' that operate ( from the shadows ) the world's banking monopolies, industrial empires, corporate conglomerates, most national governments, our mass televised and print media, terror groups (al-cia-da / al-illumina-ta ), Hollywood and anything else that operates as a corporation, yes, even our churches. By today's definition, the illuminati are the executive roundtable of Lucifer's corporate empire. And each passing day the whole world itself is being operated more and more like 'one corporation'; with the World CEO being the devil, or \"the angel of the abyss\", itself. Chapter 2: Introduction to the Illuminati's Numerological Ritual in Staging World Events The tell-tale signature or footprint of the devil's hijacking of our history has not been previously seen by the great many of us or pointed out as time and events have passed us by. One of the principle 'occult' practices of devil worship is the practice of using certain numbers associated with as many aspects of the ritual event as possible. These numbers are considered the most magical or powerful of numbers: ( ( 3,6,7,9,\"11\"(including multiples such as 22, 33 etc) 13,14(2x7),18(3x6),19,21(3x7),27(3x3x3),28(4x7)39,93(666) ) \" 3 \" represents (or mocks) the Trinity of The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. \" 6 \" is the number biblically assigned to 'the beast' in mankind, or the incarnation of the devil itself. \" 7 \" is the number associated with the Divine presence of God, The Father. As the number of notes on a musical scale, colors of the rainbow, and days of the week, the number 7 serves as an undeniable signature of Our Father's hand upon creation. There are 7 characteristics of wisdom in James 3:17. There are 7 seals and 7 angels with 7 trumpets in Revelation 6-8, 7 Spirits of God before his throne (Revelation 4:5), and 7 bowls of God's wrath (Revelation 16). Most significantly, it was on the 7th day that Our Father rested after creating the heavens and the Earth. Thus, the number 7 also indicates the end of a cycle. \" 9 \" represents 3 threes and an upside-down 6. The number 9 was sacred to Pythagoreans and thus"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Freemasonry, because it represented the perfect square (9) of the perfect number (3). Nine interestingly enough, is also the number of Satan, in Satanism. \" 11 \" is considered to be the most magical of numbers: it represents the 11 horns of the final beast that arises in biblical prophecy ( Daniel 7:7-8/Revelation 17:12 ), it mocks the final \"11\" disciples ( Judas Iscariot had already perished by the time of the Ascension ), Genesis \"11\" is the story of the \"Tower of Babel\", and to astrologers \"11\" marks the Age of Aquarius \"; the number 11 is the Aquarian number since Aquarius is the 11th sign of the zodiac. \" 13 \" represents disobedience to The Father, the 12 disciples (including Judas) + Jesus. And 13 is actually the number of full moons in a 365-day calendar year and is obviously not something the illuminati invented or discovered, yet illuminati witches do celebrate the number profusely. So sacred is 13 to them, that most buildings are not built with a 13th floor, except perhaps where they have their personal offices. \" 18 \" is the summation of the number of the beast, 6+6+6, or 3 times 6. \" 19 \" represents \"salvation\" in the illuminati's numerology, again due to certain biblical references. \" 21 \" is ( \"3\"x\"7\" - often associated with events appearing as admissions or good deeds; as if impersonating God Our Father into the event. ), \" 27 \" is 3 times 3 times 3 or 9 times 3. 28 (4x\"7\") used on illuminati staged event days as well. \" 39 \" ('13'x'3') and \" 93 \" are used as a synonym for the number of the beast as 3 9's or 999; it is viewed as the number of the beast, just partially hidden as it is upside down. The occult numbers can also be encoded in larger numbers such as when a number like \"175\" is used; as when the digits being added together (1+7+5=\"13\") reduce into one. Believe it or not, this is what the people who worship black magic believe in and use in their practice of occult devil worship. You can ask others familiar with this, or find this information posted in many places across the internet. In Chapter 4 below, how the devil's elect have applied ritual numerology will be outlined. The devil worshipping patterning of events is also outlined in the include appendices 1900-2005. You will likely be shocked to find out how many events have been associated with this occult numerology. WW II was basically entirely played out on occult dates. Adolph Hitler followed these numbers in dates of attacks like drawing with a t-square, as instructed by his illuminati masters, with little doubt. Have some doubt? Check it out! Chapter 3: The Illuminati Families and their Network of Control A group of devil worshipping elitists whose family names are intentionally hidden from mainstream view operate our whole world through their financial dominance. The European Rothschild family is known to actually leave an empty chair and place setting at their master dining table in case the devil cares to drop in to share in the meal being served. This strange behavior explains why Satanism is an officially accepted religion even in our armed services as well. However, upper-crest establishment families such as the: Rothschilds, Rockefellers, DuPonts, Freemans, Reynolds', Kennedys, Krupps, Onassis', Merovingians, Bundys, Warburgs, Russells, Lis, Mellons, Carnegies, Dukes, Astors, Dorrances, Stillmans, Bakers, Paynes, Cullmans, Watsons, Tukes, Kleinwarts, Phippses, Graces, Guggenheims, Oppenheimers, Milners, Drexels, Winthops, Vanderbilts, Whitneys, Harknesses, Bushes and Kerrys and a handful of other multi-billionaire families simply cannot go passing themselves off to the public as devil worshippers...; so many take on fake religious 'fronts'. The Rothschilds pass themselves off as Jewish; The Rockefellers Baptists, and the list goes on... However, the evidence has shown that they are the world's leading devil worshippers acting as if they believe they are self-privileged to operate, in their view, a giant worldwide orwellian sub-human 'animal farm'. Just from one family angle of influence: most people in the United States are being more enslaved to serving the Rockefeller dynasty in their lives and daily jobs. Most American gasoline stations, the Red Cross, The Encyclopedia Britannica, Time, Life, Chase Manhattan/Chemical Bank, and Fortune Magazine are just a few of their ever expanding holdings and interests."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Courtesy of Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz ( http://www.tetrahedron.org ) : { In my latest book, Death in the Air: Globalism, Terrorism, and Toxic Warfare (released June, 2001) Chapter 18 is titled, \"Public Health Politics, Eugenics, and Population Control.\" Here I detail the Rockefeller family's and their foundation's association with the population control industry. They are currently moving to eradicate half of the planet's current population, including America's civilian population as well. According to the Rockefeller-directed Population Council of the City of New York, and its affiliate the Negative Population Growth, Inc. of New Jersey, the U.S. population requires culling to 125 or 150 million people. That's about half its present number. And that, in a nutshell, is what \"America's New War\" on terrorism-leading to WWIII-is really about. Global population control and reduction through managed chaos. Using the standard Machiavellian practice of creating urgent problems, then costly solutions, America has been railroaded into what promises to be a long and deadly war against people including those previously, and likely still, on the payroll of a secret government and the CIA. Now you might comprehend, if you have \"the eyes\" to read the above text, and the discernment necessary to perceive the truth it relays, why I found it nauseating that Americans so readily gave their blood and money to the Rockefeller's Red Cross. If you are among the millions who made that mistake, chalk it up to simple deception. But for heaven's sake, don't do it again ! Please donate directly to the families who have been victimized. That way your contribution may do more than aiding and abetting the enemy. } Timothy said it best when he stated \" the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil . \" ( Tim 6:10 NIV ) . Who controls the flow of money literally controls the whole world. The Fed, IMF, BIS, World Bank are all privately owned and managed for profit corporations of the elite. The wealthiest family in the world, the \" House of Rothschild \", once produced the family's most revered and diabolical banking monopolist. His name was Nathaniel Rothschild. He repeated his father's, Mayer Amschel Bauer Rothschild, quoation \" Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes the laws . \" Well, today the \"{Banking} House of Rothschild \" out of Europe, along with their financial conspirator friends of the West, The Rockefellers , are two of the principal partners in printing the familiar green and black American money - right out of thin air . JD Rockefeller, the grandfather of the Western hemisphere's wealthiest family dynasty once publicly stated, in his view, \" Competition is sin. \" These two interests are not alone however, there are a dozen or so other private partners who o wn and control the Federal Reserve bank. To put things in better perspective: each illuminati family involved in the ownership of the Federal Reserve is much more wealthy than the entire Bush family dynasty for example. In small terms, they are literally the bank holding most of the colored paper money of the world-wide monopoly board. This is still true today. To them, money is power, but at the same time power is more valuable to them than money. \"Whoever controls the volume of money in our country is Absolute Master of all industry and commerce.\" - James Garfield, U.S. President, assassinated 3 weeks later. \" We shall precipitate an ECONOMIC CRISIS, which will stop dealing on the exchanges and bring industry to a standstill.

This is well known among concerned economists. ( please see: http://www.themoneymasters.com ) No, today's paper and electronic money is not backed by any sort of Reserve, such as gold or silver bullion. Yes, Fort Knox is guarded today just so no inquiring citizen can look in and confirm that there is *no gold* stored there anymore. No, this private bank is not 'Federal' since Congress only 'borrows' money when they determine they need to spend more and they don't ever vote on such things as the 'interest rate'. That is, the American government and people are not furnished with freshly minted money by a national treasury at nominal cost . Recipients of Federal Reserve 'notes' (literally: loans) have to *pay* interest on the money, as on a loan, to the private international interests who own the Federal Reserve; whom prints the money out of thin air. It costs \"The Fed\" the same to print a 100 dollar bill as it does to print a 1 dollar bill, a few cents. However, they know if they print up too many dollars, the value of the money in circulation goes down, then inflation increases, and people tend to take notice more - so they tend not to go hog wild in printing it up. \" The bank hath benefit of interest on all moneys it creates out of nothing. \" - William Paterson, co-founder Bank of England, c1694. In order to print more dollars though 'at cost' & 'bearing interest ', they retrieve much of it back in every year through an unconstitutional federal income tax enforced by the IRS who reserves the right to seize your property - while subverting the 4th amendment. The money from the IRS is not received into the federal treasury as one would naturally presume, it simply goes to make giant * interest payments * on the ever growing national debt ! That's how they steal your money for free - it is made to almost seem legitimate! ( Another way they *steal* your money is through a hidden tax known as 'inflation'. ) All that federal tax money literally is paid direct to the Fed's creditors for all intents and purposes! The IRS was set up through the unratified 16th amendment shortly before the installation of the Federal Reserve. This is America's ugly financial truth . In short, it is a large-scale scam on the American People. The Congress, House and Senate, have been well paid off over the decades and completely compromised to never even mention the topic of \"monetary reform\".

They succeeded not only in that, but in setting the stage for World War I, The Great Depression of 1929, World War II, the highs and lows of the stock market over the decades, the Korean and Vietnam wars, both Middle Eastern wars, and now the final act of the 'illuminati' elite's diabolical plot to rule the whole world, World War III .

Sometimes they congregate at the highly secretive international banking \" Bilderberg \" meetings. They send their establishment political and military minions from their many puppet governments to \" Tri-Lateral Commission \" conventions. Non-elected officials in the various 'shadow governments', such as war-criminal \"Henry Kissinger\", rank higher than the elected officials who attend these secretive meetings. They make sure the populous never becomes aware of their diabolical plans by making it a requirement of major press organizations to join their \" Council of Foreign Relations (CFR) \" or \" RIIA \". The elite often select presidents who have been trained in the art of ruthless deception and warfare through secretive societies they have set up, notably \" Skull & Bones \". Tax breaks for the rich establishment chairpersons controlling each media outfit ( print or televised ) and nothing short of death threats are used to control the entire enslaved press. Historian's for hire adulterate true history to obscure any involvement of the elite in the world's happenings within the covers of university level history books; making wars themselves appear to be accidental, and not profitable acts of criminal financial conspiracy for the principle benefit of the hidden ruling class. \" The Trilateralist Commission is international ...(and)...is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing CONTROL of the political government of the United States.

If our nation is ever taken over, it will be taken over from within. \" - President James Madison , 4th President The detailed story of the Illuminati families financial rise to power since ancient Rome and hundreds of others quotations are included in: \" The UNtruth of the World \" at http://www.LinkToIt.com Now, getting back to the topic of devil worship and how it is being used to control all our lives. A congenial and harmless man who grew up on a farm in the middle of America, Fritz Springmeier , became an avid fan of history throughout his youth. However, he eventually learned how things were actually being manipulated behind the scenes of what is presented to the vast populations of the world. This alarmed and deeply disturbed him as a man who had developed a deep love of the truth as a devout believer in Jesus Christ. So Fritz decided to unmask the financial conspiracy running the world and he published a book after 15 years of intense research that had its final revision come out shortly after September 11th, 2001, after his home had already once been raided by FBI. He entitled his expose of the world's ruling elite: \" The Bloodlines of the Illuminati \" Revision II. In this book, he detailed the \" 13 \" key families, many listed above who basically get together around a roundtable when they do and set the agenda for how the world is being operated as of today. They decide when the populations will be terrorized or put in a state of shock, chaos, or fear . They decide what will happen next as well. However, since the so-called illuminati families did not like Fritz reporting on them, and as these families control the world, they had the FBI frame him as a bank robber and now he is serving a life sentence in a federal prison. View the local news report that intentionally damages Fritz: http://www.katu.com/news/story.asp?ID=62438 Fritz and his wife were raided on an occult date, February \" 9 th\", 2001. He was given \" 9 \" years. He was sentenced more than two years later on November \" 13 th\", 2003. A total illuminati/masonic frame-up by the numerical signatures used! Poor Fritz gets put in jail for just trying to tell the people of America and the world the ugly truth . However, his faith is unwavering and a wonderful reward is most likely in his eternal future as a lover of the truth and believer in the gospels. In his book he exposes not only the individuals and families ultimately responsible for the world's ongoing global wars and other atrocities , the illuminati , but also their worship of the devil and ongoing satanic ritual abuse. Fritz details the banking intrigue that has gotten the world into the world wars, etc. His book is over 600 pages of highly researched unmistakable facts. Many excerpts from his books can be found on the internet for downloadable reading as well; Chapter 4 of \" The Untruth of the World\" contains key excerpts from his book. Actually, all this is 'hidden in plain view' while the 'Sheeple' are kept generally dazed, fat, comfortable, and unalarmed - for the time being prior to their full blown world war. Even if you are one to not believe one word in this book, all a truth seeker has to do is go type in the search phrase \" New World Order \" into an internet search engine or search for the large array of books now covering the topic at bookstores such as Amazon.com. A new well layed out site out of the UK is entitled \" http://www.cremationofcare.com \" - the domain name was named after one of their actual annual devil worshipping rituals.

New kingdoms were built upon concentration of control over material things. Through new uses of corporations, banks and securities, new machinery of industry and agriculture, of labor and capital - all undreamed of by the founding fathers - the whole structure of modern life was impressed into this royal service. These economic royalists complain that we seek to overthrow the institutions of America. What they really complain of is that we seek to take away their power. Our allegiance to American institutions requires the overthrow of this kind of power. In vain they seek to hide behind the flag and the Constitution. In their blindness they forget what the flag and the Constitution stand for. \" - Franklin Delano Roosevelt speech in Philadelphia on June 27, 1936 \" The rules of the world economy serve the interests of the multinational companies; they do not serve the interests of the vast majority of the people on this planet. \" - The Progressive magazine, January 2000, p10 Chapter 4: The Occult Numerology Intentionally Used in Creating world \"History\" So, how is the devil disguising itself today within today's world events? Again, as noted above, numerology is often used as their signature of their dastardly deeds that are performed with ritualistic intent. First, we begin our tour of 'history' with two important dates to recognize: On \" 11 \"/\" 18 \"/1118 the Templars were recognized in the city of Clermont. 1+1+1+8 = \" 11 \". The authors of Holy Blood Holy Grail provided the definitive evidence that there were \" 9 \" original founding Templars and they originally banded together in \"1111\" taking no new members for \" 9 \" years. The devil worshipping Adam Weishaupt founded the cult of the Illuminati of Bavaria on May \"1st\" (5+1=\" 6 \"), 1776. Now for a recent example most of us in this generation can remember: A ritual sacrifice to the devil was called for in the mid-1990's under then US president Clinton, a descendent of the Collin's family illuminati bloodline. His Attorney General, Janet Reno, who on March \" 11 th\" 1993 was confirmed by the United States Senate and sworn-in the next day, followed the date prescribed by her satanic overlords and ordered the blood sacrifice of the entire Davidian church of WACO Texas in a hellish fiery maelstrom on April \" 19 th\", 1993. The \" 19 th\" was used again in the subsequent Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, which murdered even more innocent men, women, and children in America's heartland. Apparently during these events, 'salvation' of the illuminati's devilish system was deemed most important, by not letting America continue progressively prosperous, happy, or free. These are some significant \"April 19th\" dates in past history that should also be noted: April 19 th, 1775 - American Revolutionary War: The Battle of Lexington and Concord - British General Thomas Gage attempts to confiscate American colonists' firearms. The British are driven back to Boston, Massachusetts. The American Revolutionary War begins . April 19 th, 1909 - Joan of Arc is declared a saint 478 years are her service to her people. It was said a dove of light flew out from her exhausted and burned body, witnessed also by her executioner as he was adding more wood to the fire on May 30th, 1431."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"April 19 th, 1933 - President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announces that the United States will be leaving the gold standard. April 19 th, 1943 - World War II: German troops enter the Warsaw ghetto to round up the remaining Jews, starting the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. April 19 th, 1971 - Charles Manson is sentenced to life in prison for the Sharon Tate murders. April 19 th, 1989 - A gun turret explodes on the USS Iowa, killing 47 (4+7=\"11\") sailors.

April 19 th, 1999 - The German Parliament returns to Berlin. As stated in Chapter 2, the ritual numbers that our hidden rulers are often using within dates (number and day of the month) of events themselves are: ( 3,6,7,9,\"11\"(including multiples such as 22, 33 etc) 13,14(2x7),18(3x6),19,21(3x7),27(3x3x3),28(4x7),39,93(666) ) On June 2nd, 1997 a jury convicted Timothy McVeigh on \" 11 \" felony counts. On June \" 13 th\", 1997 the jury condemns McVeigh to die by lethal injection. December \" 11 th\", 2000 McVeigh asked US District court Judge Richard Matsh to stop his appeals process and schedule his execution to take place before the summer's end (in apparent hurry to die ). January \" 11 th\", 2000 McVeigh lets pass the deadline for changing his decision. May \" 11 th\" Attorney General John Ashcroft delays McVeigh's execution until June \" 11 th\", 2001. McVeigh is supposedly executed on June \" 11 th\", 2001 at \" 7 \" a.m. By the numerics used , this is now known to obviously have been an illuminati mass mind control operation from the very beginning to the theatrical finale. McVeigh signed up for 'the secret mission'. However, the use of occult numerology in dates of global events that have created much fear or suspense, their starting or finale dates, goes back hundreds of years. For brevity, let us just examine more of the number-coded timeline of illuminati intrigue from the finale of World War I. The powers-that-were then decided, out of Germany ( where the war actually originated from! ), the best time the declare the official end of World War I was on November 11 th, 1918 at 11 am or \" 11 \"/\" 11 \"/18 at \" 11 \"am. Here the number \"11\" was highly celebrated. On February \" 27 th\"(3x3x3), 19\" 33 \"(3x11) ( 2/27/33 and 2+2+7=\" 11 \" ) Hitler had his secret police burn the Reichstag building, the German people's congressional building, to the ground into a pile of smoldering ashes. To the German people back then, this was quite similar to the attacks of 9 / 11 that the whole world witnessed in 2001. Sparing little time the Austrian born Rothschild grandson Adolph Hitler elevated himself from Chancellor, subsequently declared himself Fuhrer, and federalized the German states into a \"Homeland\" national police state prior to his ultimate invasion of Poland and the beginning of World War II in 19\" 39 \"(13x3). The United States would be drawn into the war on December \" 7 th\" 1941, three months after the groundbreaking ceremonies of the Pentagon { unbelievably: shaped as the core of a satanic pentagram symbol! } Today, a similar scenario to this is being repeated on a much larger scale."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The following outlines another financial scam that has already been played onto America: \" The Congress shall have power ...to coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures. \" 1787 - The Constitution of the United States - Section 8 That is precisely what the congress did in 1792. The dollar was fixed by law at 24.75 grains or 0.05156 troy oz. of gold. In 1837, the coinage was reworked and the dollar was defined at 25.8 grains of gold \"nine-tenths fine\". That gave $20.67 dollars to one troy oz. of gold. That was the dollar's \"fixed value\" for 96 years from 1837 to 1933. On March \" 6 th\", 1933 using a wartime statute passed in 1917, Franklin Roosevelt issued a proclamation closing every bank in the U.S. for four days. The banks were closed from March \" 6 th\" to March \" 9 th\". On March \" 9 th\", 1933, day one of \"The Hundred Days\", the president called a special session of the congress. In a few hours, with minimal if any debate, the congress passed the Gold Confiscation Act act of 1933 : \" to provide relief in the existing national emergency in banking, and for other purposes \". April \" 3 rd\", 1933 president Roosevelt, acting under the sweeping authority passed to him by congress on March \" 9 th\", 1933, he issued Executive Order 6102 (6+1+0+2=\"9\") which invoked his authority to make it unlawful to own or hold gold coins, gold bullion, or gold certificates. The export of gold for purposes of payment was also outlawed , except under license from the treasury. ( Look all this up indpendently yourself! ) Amazingly, under the Fed's heavy hand in depressing the American economy ( by continuously constricting the paper money supply after the crash of 1929 by hundreds of billions ), the American people *complied* with FDR's executive order and it was not legal for Amercans to own gold again until 1972! The following year, all the confiscated gold was taken to Fort Knox under much propaganda/fanfare. Then, secretly, all that gold started being siphoned right back to the European Central banks. There hasn't been an audit conducted at Fort Knox since 1957 under Eisenhower! America was robbed of her gold in plain sight . This is fact. Following that, in 1935, Rothschild puppet Franklin Delano Roosevelt commissioned the \"The Great Seal\" to be placed on the back of the US paper dollar. This is the illuminati's pyramid symbol. There are \" 13 \" stacks of bricks on the 'all seeing eye' pyramid. The official national seal of the United States contains \" 13 \" arrows, \" 13 \" letters, \" 13 \" laurel leaves, \" 13\" berries, \" 13 \" stars above the eagle in the form of a hexagram, \" 13 \" stripes on the shield. Many witches consider the number \" 13 \" as the most powerful number in witchcraft, and our nation has the mark of \" 13 \" put on it everywhere. The first election in North America was held on a 'Friday the \" 13 th\"' so George Washington became Commander-in-Chief on that day. Construction also began on the White House in Washington, D.C., on a Friday the \" 13 th\". Our country started with \" 13 \" colonies, and the original flag had \" 13 \" stripes and \" 13 \" stars in a circle. The American eagle on the emblem on the Federal Reserve One Note has 32 feathers on one wing and \" 33 \" on the other. The \" 9 \" tail feathers indicate the 9 additional degrees of the York Rite of Freemasonry. There are \" 33 \" steps on the side of the pyramid representing the \" 33 \" degrees of Freemasonry. Many presidents have been either 32nd degree or \" 33 rd\" degree freemasons. For instance, Franklin D. Roosevelt was a 32nd degree freemason in the Scottish Rite and the 32nd president of the United States. He was followed by Harry S. Truman, a \" 33 rd\" degree freemason also from the Scottish Rite and the \" 33 rd\" president of the United States. { FDR's depressive era \"New Deal\" packages to the People were actually brown-paper wrapped increased socialist control over the People for the principal benefit of his elite masters elsewhere around the world. } We must remember the words of the infamous"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"illuminist and exploited Franklin D. Roosevelt who said, ì In politics nothing is by accident; if it happens, you can be sure we planned it that way. \" The corner-stone of the Capitol building was laid ( October \" 13 th\", 1792 ) by President Washington, who also officiated at the laying of the corner-stone of the north wing of the Capitol ( September \" 18 th\", 1793 ). See, this devilish conspiracy against America goes back to its creation . That's why the establishment talking heads and so many others argue that there is *no conspiracy* at work at all, which is the mother of all the conspiratorial lies . All the establishment fraternity members are all still working together within the Conspiracy, so why would one of them adamantly admit to there being a Conspiracy and risk his fortunes or his head? To this end, they each still persist; some just like to call it 'the rat race'. But who controls the cheese? There are numerous other such examples. Quite obviously the signature number of our nation and of witchcraft, which existed long before our nation, is \" 13 \". According to witchcraft tradition, nearly half of the people who came to North America on the ship the ìMayflowerî were witches fleeing from Scotland. ( Please reference: http://www.lasttrumpetministries.org ) The 33 rd degree Grand Lodge of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry is located exactly \" 13 \" blocks north of the White House above an upside down pentagram outlined by the road layout which rests on the White (today prononced \"Reich\") House. And is it really a coincidence that the Statue of Liberty is \" 22 \" stories tall? ( or 111'1\" ) Could it just be a coincidence that the Statue was built upon an eleven-pointed fort? No . This is inscribed on the plaque at the base of the Statue of Liberty: \" At this site on August 5, 1884, the cornerstone of the pedestal of the statue of ëLiberty Enlightening the Worldí was laid with ceremony by William A. Brodie, Grand Master of Masons in the state of New York. Grand Lodge members, REPRESENTATIVES of the united states and French governments, army and navy officers, members of foreign legations, and distinguished citizens were present. This plaque is dedicated by the Masons of New York in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of that historic event. \"(Note:8/5/84 8+5= \" 13 \")   Here is just one more set of \" 13 \" references: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the following on the program 'Face the Nation': \" Yes, 13 is my favorite number; I am the 13 th person to hold this office; my first appearance was before the 13 th Congressional hearing, and 13 is my favorite day of the month. \" On \"September 11 th\" , 1941 the groundbreaking ceremonies of the Pentagon ( modeled after the inside of a satanic five pointed star symbol ) were held. \" The Masons set up shop in D.C. and set up their criminal enterprise there from the beginning. They figured they would stick around until the people ran them out. THEY....ARE....STILL....THERE! \" - anonymous posting found on a numerology website. Therefore on the morning of the 60th anniversary of the Pentagon, the WTC was detonated . Just a coincidence? Hardly . The occult numerical date signatures during WW II are much too lengthy to be listed here - but you can scroll through them in the appendix listings 1938-1945 below. * Every large Nazi attack or major atrocity during World War II occured on the illuminati's coveted occult numbered dates ."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"* The Allies also principally responded on occult dates. For example: On August \" 6 th\", 1945 at 8:15 a.m. United States B-29 bomber Enola Gay, on Mission No. \" 13 \", dropped an atomic bomb called \"Little Boy\" on Hiroshima, Japan right next to the \" 33 rd\" degree latitude line. This was \"Day One\" of the Nuclear Age. It was also 33 days after 169th 13 x 13 anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. On August \" 9 th\", Hiroshima was flattened by another nuclear bomb. Both were dropped on illuminati dates . In fact, the great bulk of the battle history of WW II all occured on the occult numbered dates ; most every large operation included. The most notable series of Nazi excecutions have occured on occult dates; particularly February \" 11 th\"'s (2+11=\"13\"). Please see for yourself.

So, skipping to the next *major* world event: On 10/\" 22 \"(11x2)/1962 JFK delivered a speech about the closest nuclear confrontation ( although staged for this fear inducing effect ) ever to occur between the East and West, The Cuban Missile Crisis ; which began on 10/ 14 (2x7)/62, and it was scripted to last \" 13 \" days, ending 10/\" 27 \"/62. This became known and the \"13 days of October\". These are the unmistakable facts about the little imprisoned island known as 'Earth' in 1962. Later that year, December \" 11 th\", 1962 was a day of the formation in West Germany of the coalition government of Christian Democrats, Christian Socialists, and Free Democrats. 1 month and \" 11 \" days later on January \" 22 \"nd, 1963 - the Elysee treaty between France and Germany was signed. 1 month later on February \" 11 \"th, 1963, CIA Domestic Operations Division was created. April \" 7 th\" - Yugoslavia is proclaimed to be a Socialist republic and Josip Broz Tito is named President for life. June \" 21 st\" - Pope Paul VI is elected by the College of Cardinals. On August 5th ( 8+5=\" 13 \" ), 1963 The US, UK, and USSR sign a nuclear test ban treaty. There are all examples of obvious devil worshipping illuminati control signature dates . Exactly 1 year and 1 month after the \"missile crisis\", due to it being sensed by his masters that JFK had ambitions to defect against the ruling elite and expose them: abolish the Federal Reserve and IRS, withdraw American troops from Vietnam ( and other 'no-nos' to the elite ), an assassination plot to remove him succeeded on 11/\" 22 \"(2x11)/1963. ( 5 bullets were found from different guns. ) This also occurred in the middle of the Masonically architected Dealy Plaza which is on the \" 33 rd\"(3x11) longitudinal parallel. \" The high office of the President has been used to foment a plot to destroy the American's freedom and before I leave office, I must inform the citizen of this plight. \" - President John Fitzgerald Kennedy - Columbia University on Nov. 12, 1963, ten days before his assassination LBJ succeeded him ( coincidentally ) as the \"36th\" president.

JFK's ambition for America to go to the moon as a joint US/USSR mission was theatrically presented to the American people later that decade in the \" 7 th\" month, named \"Apollo 11 \".

It is important to note the following on the timeline: The bankruptcy of the USA is officially on record in the United States Congressional Record of March 17th, 1993 (3+1+7=\" 11 \") ( Vol. \" 33 \", page H-\" 13 \"\" 03 \") speech by James Traficant Jr of Ohio. Congressman Jim Traficant is now in federal prison and his family have been threatened while he has been serving his trumped up sentence. (A clear warning to congress to keep their mouths shut.) During the Geneva Conventions in Switzerland between 1928 and 1932 the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal were officially declared *bankrupt*. These countries still are officially and legally bankrupt to the international banking system and will"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"remain so until released by the receivers. Needless to say the illuminati banking tyrants are not planning to release these nations from their financial entrapment. Jim Traficant stated at the podium in Congress: \" It is an established fact that the United States Federal Government has been dissolved by the Emergency Banking Act, March \" 9 th\", 19\" 33 \", 48 Stat. 1, Public Law 89-\" 7 \"\" 19 \"; declared by President Roosevelt, being bankrupt and insolvent.

The receivers of the United States Bankruptcy are the International Bankers, via the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . All United States Offices, Officials, and departments are now operating within a de facto status in name only under Emergency War Powers . With the Constitutional Republican form of government for the United States now dissolved, the receivers of the bankruptcy have adopted a new form of government for the United States. This new form of government is known as a Democracy , being an established Socialist/Communist order under a new governor for America. This act was instituted and established by transferring and/or placing the Office of the Secretary of Treasury to that of the Governor of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . Public Law 94-564, page 8, Section H.R. \" 13 \"\" 9 \"\"55\" reads in part: \" The US Secretary of Treasury receives no compensation for representing the United States....... \" The United States has been run as a *corporation* and its judiciary operates under Emergency International Maritime Law . Nothing really new here of course as America was set up as a corporation immediately after the American War of Independence. The colonists were run by the Virginia Company when the Colonies reverted from an overt dictatorship from the British Crown to a covert dictatorship of the interests of international bankers, most of whom are from Britain as stated above. They only cut themselves away from America then to only to secretly place themselves back in again later while America was truly sleeping. So, on secret documents stuffed somewhere, America has been officially bankrupt since 19\"33\"!

December \" 13 th\", 2000 - Al Gore conceded and Bush Jr. is implanted as the president by the illuminati.

The political researcher does not look forward to that coming day of terror however it may be played out. The following sequences were discsovered by Michael B. Haupt of http://www.threeworldwars.com regarding the Tsumani on December 26th, 2004 and the Iranian earthquake of December 26th, 2003: Since 2004 was a leap year, the number of days between the Iran quake on the same day in 2003 is 3\"66\", or 1 year and 1 day.

Does this entire ( and amazing ) sequence of events with the obvious use of occult numerology in the dates throughout history surprise you? If not, review them again perhaps using a spreadsheet to calculate the unfathomable numerical improbability of these events all strung together. In review, please note that our hidden rulers apparently fund both sides of any conflict and fund most if not all military and terror operations and decide the date the event will occur; yes their power has grown to this degree! Interestingly Daniel's biblical prophecy foretells that an \"abomination that causes desolation\" is going to be set up after 1260th day and another on the 1290th day after some key event in our history. Using 9-11-01 as that index date, the 1260th day becomes 2/\" 22 \"(2x11)/05.

March 24th also happens to be Holy (or \"Maundy\") Thursday , the day believers celebrate remembrance of Jesus' Last Supper! Amazing timings here as well! And when you arrive at the 1335th day ( as it is written in Daniel 12: ' Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1335 days. ' ), that calculation lands on Sunday May 8th, 2005 ! This is not only the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, VE Day, ( and Mothers' Day and a full moon as well ), this day is known to believers as the celebration of \" Ascension Sunday \". Perhaps it will be \"Descension Sunday\" this time, after a prophetic \" time, times, and half a time \". ( Daniel 12:7 ) ( 2005? ) Possibly! Best to keep a watchful eye each hour, yet the date and hour of Our Lord's Second Coming is still one of the world's Greatest mysteries!!!

Summary: My dear friends and fellow people of the world - what are you going to do? Do you need any more evidence that you have been tricked? Manipulated? Abused? Plotted against on a global scale? Are you going to at least warn your fellow brothers and sisters around the world to prepare for days of illuminati-planned chaos and tribulation and possibly study the messages in The Bible and take the time to right oneself with their Father in Heaven? Are you at least going to present this same information to them? Have we already seen the recent great swarms of locusts in Egypt and Mexico and many prophetic natural disasters of late? At the end of 2004 these giant locusts plagued the Israeli State, Mexico, the Spanish Canary Islands, and the land of Egypt(!) It is perhaps already too late to prevent the illuminati devil worpshipping conspirators from releasing the expected plague(s) this spring. In 2004, Bush Jr. signed a 5.6 (5+6=\"11\") billion dollar bill \" Project Bio-Shield \" to help inject the populous with the illuminati's bio-engineered plagues.

We should all hope this type of future event does not happen and that exposure might have lessen any impacts. However, it should be noted that the: * \" 27ths \" of a month is the most popular date for terror bombings throughout history as the evidence of the last century displays. * The \" 19ths \" have been used for terrorism and most military coups as well. * The \" 11ths \" and \" 22nds \" have been used for exceptional days in global politics and is also the day of most assassinations.

That is, if there wasn't a \"hidden hand\" orchestrating all these events. ) The following was excepted from a website dealing in the exposure of occult numerology: Numerologists believe all numbers carry a very specific vibration or demonic energy level. The number 9 is associated with energy, and is considered to be a powerful number. Since 9 is the highest single number, numerologists believe it to be capable of achieving great spiritual and mental results. 11 is a master number that the demons will work lying wonders through: 11 has almost unlimited energy. It is one of the master numbers and possesses more potential than other numbers by resonating a higher vibration and thus more strongly influencing people and events. The 11 is the most intuitive of all numbers. It represents illumination; a channel to the subconscious; insight without rational thought; and sensitivity, nervous energy, shyness, and impracticality...It is the psychic's number. The Master Numbers, which include 9 and 11 , are supposed to be used only in exceptional occasions. This information is not meant to deceive, it is simply meant to inform and hopefully help reform this world we currently call our home. As it is written, those who overcome may look forward to the coming Kingdom of God, The Father, and His Son's return to Earth for us to enjoy a millennial rein with the divine Son and Our Ultimate Lord and Saviour, His Beautiful (and Honest) Majesty Jesus Christ.

Discussion of Bible Prophecy: Daniel 7 ( NIV ) Daniel's Dream of Four Beasts ( similarly the graphic displayed in the appendix was rendered by the artist from Revelation 13:1-4 ) 1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream. 2 Daniel said: \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"heaven churning up the great sea. 3 Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea. 4 \"The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it. 5 \"And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of flesh!' 6 \"After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule. 7 \"After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast-terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. 8 \"While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was *another horn*, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully. ( Here Daniel identifies \"anti-christ\", the \" 11 th\" horn! ) Revelation 17:12-14 ( NIV ) 12ì The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. 13They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast. 14They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings-and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers. î The eleventh \" 11 th\" horn is the prophetic anti-Christ! (Daniel 7:8) It should be also noted that Genesis \" 11 \" (1-9) described the building of the *Tower of Babel* in ancient Babylon ( geographically: Iraq ). Apparently even the rich and powerful back then thought that this was the only way they were going to get into heaven! But as the story went - God demolished it long ago; and it is buried deep under the sand in Iraq. The four beasts of Daniel's ( Chapter 7 ) prophetic vision may just be: 1) Lion (Great Britain and Scotland both us this symbol, as do the York and Scottish Rites of Freemasonry) with Eagles Wings ( obviously America ) 2) Bear ( Obvious symbol of Communism ) with 3 ribs in mouth ( Russia, China, Korea ) 3) Leopard ( Germany has used this symbol; 'panzar' ( leopard tank ) with 4 heads (1st,2nd,3rd,4th Reichs) and 4 bird wings ( always done under the wings of the establishment churches ) Germany is always where the darkest illuminati have secretly ruled out of ( somewhere in Bavaria ). 4) Global 10 horned beast ( Possibly the new Commonwealth of 10 European (Union) States or 10 UN biosphere regions; or perhaps the 10 nations that ratified the ICC - the International Criminal Court as well! ) The Skull & Bones secret number is \" 322 \". Perhaps it turns into '666' as follows (using its multiplicative inverse: \"233\" ) : 2x'( 3 )00'=600 + 3x'( 2 )0'=60 + 3x'( 2 )'=6 ===> \" 666 \" Mysteriously, also it should be noted the number of days in the year divided by eleven: 365/11 = 33.181818181818 or \"33\".(6+6+6).(6+6+6).(6+6+6) ...

Concerning the truth of the world you live in, the wisest of men once said: \" let them who have eyes see, and let them who have ears listen. \" He also said \" the truth will set you free. \" ( Possibly from the control of the hidden illuminati hand as well. ) Please consider reading The UNtruth of the World, which documents in detail how the illuminati's financial scam took root.

Hopefully for all of us, you found this information enlightening on the spiritual and physical warfare now being aggressively launched upon us by the hidden ruling elite. At the start of 2005 it is estimated that between 1% and 5% of the American middle-class are now aware of these deeper, yet hidden from the public's view, hair-raising discoveries ( in many cases re-discoveries ) of truth that is now developing across the land. Yes, there is a global 'hidden hand' and they deal in dirty and bloody business world-wide. If over 50% of people understand this, and defy their system ( perhaps protest by abandoning their 'credit' system by simply each stop paying the big banks with their bills for their plastic money; then when their system collapses, force a reformed government to enact monetary reform ) and return to simply obeying The 10 Laws of The Father and nothing contrary ordered to you from above, it may be over for the devilish \"hidden hand\" within our world society that has been adulterating our otherwise true ( and peaceful ) history for hundreds of years. Perhaps Jesus Christ will make His promised return when most of us least expect it. Only when the great many of us around the world understand these higher truths will we be set free!"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"This report has exposed actual evidence showing that occult numerology has been ritualistically embedded into the dates of the largest events of our \"world history\" . Without having to explain the mathematical improbabilities computing it \"impossible\" that such a long string of \"coincidences\" can occur continuously over 100+ years of world history, here the reader is simply given a sufficient and guided tour of the events, dates, and times. The reader is clearly urged to make up their own mind during this presentation of these events as they happened and when they happened; provided here with a \"mountain-top\" view of all these events of our history. These events and times are all completely factual in the sense that everyone can agree upon them and then all together clearly see the evident numerological pattern that has been applied. All the people in the world, or at least those who become aware of this, are then each individually presented two options: to go right along celebrating the schedule of events still being conducted by the shadowy \"hidden hand\" now actively manipulating and adulterating the history of the world -or- do something to help change this devilishly inspired patterning of \"news\" events of this world we all currently call home before more are murdered or are made into slaves by those who serve themselves and the beast! Two remaining questions to be answered are: How will We, a diverse People of many various locations, faiths, religions, and financial, personal, and political dispositions and allegiances, together make this massive transformation from current world thinking and how history has been unfolding; previously only left to repeat itself on a greater scale each time around? How fast or slow will it occur? Can humanity bring the Illuminati to trial? Not likely. How quickly will Rothschild and Rockefeller take the stand cross examined by The People with the illegitimate illuminati controlled puppet government out of the way? This is a doomsday plan. 2005 should be the last year of the infamous and nefarious \"Bilderberg\" meetings that now secretly involve most all governments. ( see: http://www.bilderberg.org ) The People should ban such activities and keep a closer eye on the wealthy elite than they currently have on all of us. Notice that the Bilderberg Group has core of 39 members who are broken into 3 groups of 13 member. The core of 39 answers to the 13 who make up the Policy Committee. The 13 members of the Policy Committee answer to a Round Table of 9. ALL SOLDIERS CURRENTLY SERVING SATAN'S ILLUMINATI SYSTEM TRULY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS! If all the soldiers of the world in solidarity with each other begin to obey Our Father's Commandment that one should not kill , and re-point their many guns, starting with the American military, and returned home - the illuminati would not be able to continue their stage managed global warfare. There is always a higher truth to be searched for and discovered. Only when the great many of us around the world understand and agree upon these higher truths will we be set free as has already been written! \" Military men are dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns for foreign policy. \" - Henry Kissinger, Long-time shadow government official and war criminal \" It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder. Nothing will end war unless the people themselves refuse to go to war. The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who donít do anything about it. \" - Albert Einstein, Critical Thinking Scientist \" Strike against war, for without you no battles can be fought! Strike against manufacturing shrapnel and gas bombs and all other tools of murder! Strike against preparedness that means death and misery to millions of human beings! Be not dumb, obedient slaves in an army of destruction! Be heroes in an army of construction. \" ~ Helen Keller, 1940"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"In closing, it should be stated that from all of our homes, we should all humble ourselves and pray with all the love in our hearts to The Father and Son through the Holy Spirit for spiritual guidance and help while seeking mercy from today's \"beast\" - each morning, afternoon, and night. Each of us should not fall for the elite controlled establishment media's strong delusion. We will not succeed if we don't view God's word as the ultimate truth of what will ultimately save us. We can make war with the beast ( Rev 13:4 ) ; and we can do all things through Christ which strengthens us ( Phil 4:13 ) . We can refuse to worship the beast ( Rev 13:8 ) . ~~~~~~~ Illuminati Calendar Dates of Global Events/Intrigue/Collaboration: 1900: January \"1st\" (\"1/1\") - Nigeria become a British Protectorate.

Eric earned a congressional nomination to the Air Force Academy in 1989 but accepted an AFROTC scholarship to Purdue University. Being an inch too tall to be a pilot and having a heart murmur that was later corrected, he left the Air Force and took a civilian job as a software developer for a total of 8 years with Motorola. In 1995 he moved to Austin Texas to help work on the PowerPC microprocessor (macintosh cpu). He operated the technical support hotline for Motorola's PowerPC customers and then ventured off to Austin Texas software startups such as Hyperformix, Mall.com, Partnerware, and lastly with the Cobalt Group (developers of the industry standard dealership eCRM application, LeadManager.) In 2003 after reporting on 911 for over 1 year under the mentorship of Alex Jones with his own cable access show \"The 911Exposed.com Newshour\", he quit his comfy high paying job and left for poor Central America to write a book entitled \"The UNtruth of the World\", available for free download on the internet.

This one believer *believes* there is something you can do right now. You can drop to your knees or however you would choose to do it and speak to your Father in Heaven who really would like to hear from you again. Truly! You can pray in the name of His Son Jesus, the Christ. He will hear you. Try to do this each night, because once the great majority of the People of the World turns back to Our Father - He is the Only One Who can pull the rug out from under the devil worshipping globalists; and then Jesus *may* return to secure the beast back in his cage in the center of iniquity along with all those who worshipped themselves, stone idols, perpetually dismayed The Father, worshipped \"the system\", and/or endlessly pursued other pleasures and distractions more than appreciating His Truth or helping others less fortunate. Please re-read the Book \"The Bible\". \" And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. \" Romans 12:2 (KJV) Certainly do not conform yourself to this world's devilish \"propaganda\" .

Tell him that you wish to send him this report.

Afterword : This report exposes how most men and women have been generationally deceived by our arch enemy; the devil. Here it is summarized how World Wars are created and develop and perhaps how the approaching World World III may be prevented or at least lessened through properly directed 'humility', 'faith', 'love', and 'appreciation' of Our Eternal Creator, Our God, Our Father, and unity in Our Living Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who will one day and hour make his promised return in full sight to all of us as it is already written. This e-paper exposes the class of people behind all of these horrible world wars: a shadowy imperial oligarchy of devil worshipping 'illuminati' international bankers emerging from a handful of the world's wealthiest families. Their control networks have now been exposed by which they have established with their excessive amounts of money and political power. It shows why they conspire against the poor who they are now calling \"the billions\": a sinfully perpetual bloodlust for power over all other men, women, and their children. It shows how they craft propaganda through print and *television* to intentionally and effectively *deceive* nation upon nation and culture upon culture into fear, hatred, and warring with each other through every method available to them; principally *lies* . The wealthy elite conspirators exercise their control over our world from their ivory towers, intelligence, and communications networks through their global *monarchy* of installed"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"puppet national government and military 'leaders'. They know the psychological techniques necessary to mind control entire populations, the whole indeed being more gullible than the parts, into making them believe and react a certain way desirable to them. A roundtable of men feverishly conspire to create the conditions and *propaganda* so that people of different skin colors, locations, and religions hate and wish to kill each other; they wield enough influence to make people harden their hearts against the Father, sin, and grow to fear and hate their fellow brothers and sisters all around the world. All the while the elitist war orchestrators have made and make every attempt to stay hidden from the public's eye; as if they are non-existent or 'neutral' during periods of peace & war. Fiction? Hardly. In their clandestine control over the world America is not excluded. In fact, the American people are now the heaviest hit with mind control methods through their televisions and popular culture. America is now also functioning on roughly 5 trillion dollars of credit/debt and the \"bankruptcy\", although rigged, of the nation is only ballooning. This document is to point out the real enemy behind the curtains of each global war including the one being played out today. Evidence pointed out here shows the illuminati elite's methodology of conducting their wars as a succession of devil worshipping ritual events; in which the timing of these events have by now told us that our most difficult periods of 'history' have obviously been laced with occult numerological signatures used in the dates of their actions. This report, used as a tool for mass educating our bretheren across the internet , can cast light on the real evil machinations behind the development of wars and other atrocities such as 'political terrorism' that we have all seen: he Western \" 9/11 \"'s and the Eastern \" 3/11 \"'s of yesteryear and the new fearful events our hidden warmongers are constantly planning in cooperation with the Skull & Bones controlled \"Reich House\" in Washington DC. \" When all government, domestic and foreign, in little as in great things, shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated. \" - Thomas Jefferson In short, [after another devestating illuminati staged terror event] if the American people allow foreign UN/NATO financed troops to enter and attempt to disarm the middle-class because their corrupted government mandates that this must be done in the name of 'peace' - logic states that the despots will not only destroy families and *freedom* in America; but all around the world as well. The final illuminati plot is to establish a One World Government, where the elitists envision ruling the planet, as a globalized *feudal* system, consisting of the ruling class elite and 1 billion remaining (or less) micro-chipped and tracked human slaves to provide for industry and to serve them. The global conspirators are planning on having the population reduced through stage managed managed warfare, famines, and the release of deadly biological plagues. All the corporate CEOs who chalk all this up as a \"conspiracy theory\" would be perpetual unrepentant liars. On April \" 3 rd\", 1933 Franklin Roosevelt convinced all Americans that they needed to offer up all their gold bars and coins under the penalty of a hefty $100,000 fine \"to help get America out of the Depression\". Americans willingly complied across the board and have since lost most of the massive gold stock the middle-class once possessed; funneled right out of Fort Knox back to the big European international banks and the illuminati's personal vaults. Similarly, will Americans willingly give up their guns and their 2nd Amendment after another staged and more devestating terror attack? We should hope not. We must reach out to the soldiers so they can discover they have a Lord who reigns much higher than their sargeants or majors or commander in chief. {thief} We all know Jesus would not harm anyone and we should all try to forever conform to his loving standards!"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"\" Some call you 'the elite'. I just like to call you my bankers. { Laughing if off ! }\" - George W.

Were not the castles the ultimate target of the wars long ago? Why did that change? Why are the poor and innocent citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere the first and the last to get attacked by these wars of today? Why has Sadaam Hussein not been brought to trial? Or Osama? Or how about the American people bringing the Bush administration onto trial for lying to them repeatedly? Why does keeping our 'leaders' in check or true justice seem so anti-establishment and far fetched today? Now we know why, and we should uproot this devilish system of control and return in spirit to Our Lord. Hosea 4:6 \" My people are destroyed by lack of knowledge. \" The Word of God is the foundation of true knowledge. Please note that every date listed in this report is true as these events appeared in the various newpaper headlines on that day of the month. They can each be verified on the internet, and principally at the online enclyclopedia: http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com It should be noted that as of the beginning of 2005, that the stock market is on brink of collapse just as it occured in 1929 under the same system. ( proof given here also w/recent Forbes article authored in part by Stephen Roach, the chief economist for Morgan Stanley & Co. - the article link is given at end of this report. ) Do you still think it can't happen in America?; - please don't be on the side of the globalists in also fooling yourself - it already has happened in America! Perhaps your are recently confused by the recent high tech computer animated re-enactment of the Kennedy assassination presented on the \"History\" Channel convincingly narrated by the media prostitute \"Bill Kurtis\". Please don't be confused - Kennedy was hit by a bullet in his forehead that knocked his head quickly \"back\" in alignment with the popular 'grassy knoll' accusation. 5 bullets were discovered from different guns. This recent propaganda whitewashing completely skipped over these facts... they didn't even show those images. The founding question posed by this report is: Do the people all over the world really want to know \"the truth\"? If not; if We The People of the whole world allow ourselves to be continuously manipulated and lied to instead, as most everyone is now, we will surely suffer nightmarish warfare and atrocities due to our widespread and ongoing lack of concern. The plans now in store for the billions of people of the world are horrific! Certainly, big consequences will soon spring up for our great body of our brothers and sisters who now continually accept the lies and subtle daily manipulations from their couches and lazy-boy chairs being presented through their televisions. How would Hitler's government have used the television to control the thoughts of the German people in the days leading up to World War II? Similarly, would the corporate networks today alarm the people in each hemisphere of the prospect and onset of another bloody world war and an ensuing global tyranny that is fully operated by shadowy and faceless elite power-crazed international banking overlords? When people demonstrate a perpetual pattern of gullibility and even willful compliance with"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"evil, one must wonder what is really the root cause of it all. Is it ignorance? Is it indifference? Maybe it is personal ambition or the love of comfort. There is another possibility: it could be divine delusion in part as well. \" And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him? \" Revelation 13:4 (KJV) According to the Scriptures, people who *readily* reject truth are destined to receive a \" strong delusion \". The amount of money the devil's followers are spending to deceive the elect is staggering. They will give their last million if necessary to fund propaganda campaigns in various forms to get the Christians to believe their palatable lies and reject the hard sayings of Our Father's Commandments, will for us, and prophecy. Today's politicians are the most experienced, skilled, and masterful of liars and hypocrites; they are the vastly more wealthy and deceitful than the most ambitious of used-car salesmen. For example, persons such as George H. Bush and Bill Clinton will gladly get on Larry King Live together, with each working for his own individual self-serving interests, and do their best to sweet talk to the viewing audience about their \"faith in a loving god\" on the heart-breaking topic of the tsunami in the Indian Ocean. They are so slick, and work together as if they have one mind, that the viewer at home is left to believe that each of these men are true God-fearing Christians with noble and loving hearts who in their private moments are each deeply distressed about each and every death that has occured in their wars or in natural disasters such as the tsunami. They each realize the best time to capitalize on enhancing the public's perception of them, for themselves, is right after a big disaster. Is their hypocrisy not so thinly veiled in what they each desire to project to the public eye when the camera is on them? Who can possibly ever deceive more people than the devil itself; and those who worship his ways and those who knowingly allow themselves to walk in step along with his lies? This researcher and author also feels it would do a great deal of good if *everyone* of sufficient age read this report and became aware of and learned to recognize the devil's \"hidden hand\" in our world until all is uncovered; the details of the whole truth eventually surfaced. The question remains and persists: when will The People finally reject the establishment's lies, delusions, mind control, and financial entrapment and begin striking their efforts right at the subterranean foundation of the true infamous tower of evil in our world? The past accurately reflects that the majority of this world's people have always been at the tail end of a long list of abuses of the power elite; no matter what century it has been since ancient Rome. This first half of 2005 is surely the last of any breezy/relative calm before their next planned storm, a third and more expansive world war. Surely at this rate, it would take a widespread miracle or mass awakening for it to one year cease. The globalists innate path of \"self-destruction\" seems to be partial hope as the public is too feckless & weak to resist.

The beauty of the second amendment is that it will not be needed until they try to take it. \" - Thomas Jefferson In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control, and from that year until 1953, twenty million people were rounded up and exterminated. Turkey established gun control in 1915, and over the next three years, 1.5 million Armenians were rounded up and exterminated. Germany established gun control in 1938, and over the next seven years, 13 million people were rounded up and exterminated. China established gun control in 1935, and over the next 17 years, twenty million people were rounded up and exterminated. In 1964, Guatemala established gun control, and during the next 17 years, 100,000 people were rounded up and exterminated. In 1970, Uganda established gun control, and during the next eight years, 300,000 people were rounded up and exterminated. In 1956, Cambodia established gun control, and from 1975 to 1977, one million \"educated people\" were rounded up and exterminated.

Executive Orders Awaiting Activation Upon Bush Jr.'s Declaration of Martial Law: Concerning the many \"Executive Orders\" awaiting activation when criminal elite unleash their next act of political terrorism and declare a national state of crisis: ( How many Americans remember how Germany, loaded with ordinary Germans, quickly fell to fascism just 6 decades ago, or within the lifetime of one generation? ) The following is excerpted from the larger essay by John Loeffler entitled: Quo Vadis America: Three Threats to Freedom located at: http://www.khouse.org/articles/currentevents/19980301-112.html Issuing Executive orders was the means by which Germany was converted from a Republic"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"into a Nazi dictatorship in just three months. Executive Orders are issued by the president and appear in the Federal Register for 30 days. If there is no challenge by Congress, the order then becomes law. Similar to EOs are Presidential Decision Directives, such as the secret PDD25, which allows for theuse of U.S. troops in UN operations without congressional approval-in violation of the Constitution. There have been thousands of executive orders written by presidents since the 1940s. Most of these consist of administrative housekeeping. However, a few orders involve much more than the efficient management of the nation. They virtually suspend constitutional rights and provide dictatorial powers to the executive branch of the government in a time of real or contrived emergency. There is no provision for how long a state of emergency can last. If the president were to declare an emergency, for whatever reason, Congress's consent is not even required. Executive orders give the government the power to act as an unaccountable dictatorship. In addition, authority does not flow from the president to the governors of the various states during the emergency, but rather through the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and his regional directors. The states are totally bypassed. Executive Order 10995 empowers the government to take over all communications media: radio, television, newspapers, magazines, CB, HAM, short wave, telephones, satellite and the Internet. The First Amendment would be suspended. Executive Order 10997 allows the government to control all electric power, petroleum, gas, fuel and minerals. Executive Order 10998 gives government control of food and farm production. Executive Orders 10999, \"11\"003, and \"11\"005 control transportation, including private automobiles, highways, waterways, rail lines, airports and public storage facilities. Government can seize any vehicle. Executive Order \"11\"001 allows for the seizure of health, education, and welfare functions, including hospitals, pharmaceuticals, and schools. Executive Orders \"11\"000 , \"11\"002 and \"11\"004 , perhaps most disturbing of all, provide for the registration and relocation of individuals as the government ses fit, including separation of families based on the perceived needs in dealing with a declared crisis. These orders also provide for the seizure of housing and the establishment of new public housing."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"About the Mark of the Beast: For centuries Christians have speculated about the Mark of the Beast described in the Book of Revelation. Nineteen hundred years ago the apostle John received a vision from The Most High, that in the last days no one on earth will be able to buy or sell anything without the Mark of the Beast - the Antichrist. This is the first time in history, when technology has been available to fulfil this prophecy. Texas Instruments markets the TIRIS (Texas Instruments Registration & Identification System) which is used in a wide range of applications (some of you may already use them on your auto for toll road authentication). TIRIS also comes in a 19mm glass capsule bio-implant model, a programmable hand-held reader, along with a multi-shot injector gun capable of high speed and high volume (was designed for livestock identification needs -- which is used in the European Union countries for agriculture inventory tracking and subsidy programs). It can encode \" 19\" digits, which in a variety of combinations can be programmed with up to 34 billion code numbers. Widely known is the Hughes Identification Device RF/ID tag. Their injectable transponder is the TX1400L, \" 11\"mm x \" 2.1\"mm , glass encapsulated. Product literature says: \"Although specifically designed for injecting in animals, this transponder can be used for other applications requiring a micro-sized identification tag.\" Right now, there is a computer chip the size of a grain of rice ( \" 6\"mm long ) and can carry all information on any individual and is self-charging. It is charged by the body's heat, and after planners invested 1.5 million of your tax dollars, they found out that the best places to put this chip would be in the right hand or if that is missing or impractical, in the forehead. This chip will be injected in the hand or forehead in the same way as a shot. There will be \" 18\" digits, your zip code, plus the extra four digits after the dash and your social security number, burned on the chip. These \" 18\" digits will be grouped in three groups of six numbers. (000000 000000 000000) The pattern(s) is not a coincidence or a mistake. The existence of this subtle manipulation is proof positive that the battle for our souls is real and even escalating. It is just small indicator of the colossal battle between good and evil, which balances perfectly with the biblical warnings of the End Times. Your soul is the target. Are you ready to fight off the attack?

I, Eric Rainbowlt, do not wish to add or subtract one or any words from actual Bible prophecy . In the book of Revelation it states that the faithful will be persecuted during the tribulations and be *beheaded* (with a sharp sickle) during the Harvest of the Earth. Please see Revelation 13:15 and Revelation 14:18 and Revelation 20:4 which states: \" And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. \" Faithful believers love Jesus more than their own lives .

If this is not \"The End Days\" in 2005 however, this researcher believes it would still be a righteous act, group practice if we will, to throw off the chains and shackles of the international money changers, as Jesus did himself in the Temple; the devil's elect who deceive and literally poison us to such an incredible degree in these days. First, the reconstituted US government would cancel the debts to the money changers, (debts and money they made out of 'thin air'). Then the US Treasury would be re-commissioned to print 'debt-free' US dollars once again. These dollars would be used to pay off any legitimate outstanding national debts. To deal with the illuminati's large stockpiles of gold, it should be searched for, aggregated together, accounted for, and melted down and made into coins the size of that which would supply every man woman and child on Earth with one gold coin apiece. These would then be able to be traded for other currencies, including the fresh new US Treasury dollars. This would in effect provide a gold-backing for all the currencies of the world as gold would be monetized, distributed, and circulated once again along with the various paper currencies. The stamp of Jesus' image should be placed on the coins to remind all who is really Lord. The illuminati would then be expected to work productive jobs as with the rest of us all to support themselves and their families.
